========================================

now just a reminder to remember these this morning three superhero my little Burley is minister in Africa [Music] so everybody's so let's uh we're gonna tell obviously about it what was Sean mother's food but before we get into that let's just go a little different you'll regard we think you've got for your grace and mercy to us today Lord and I pray God to anise be with us all and open the word to us lord help us a little bit of home life journey afraid up to a little bit away sister Jude weather releases pristine but a fairly overhead ministry and all these the ones working for you for Jesus remember us to label of God pray that today we just don't know but not just any other suddenly but a special day for us for the workers because more more like Jesus brainania Jesus Christ Amy no Joe jehova shamma did one of the one of the compound dangers at home right it means like like a lot of the other compound names of Jehovah it's kind of hidden in scripture where it's not you know you think it might be spelled out where you could to see general was Shama but it's the the Hebrew of a scriptural reference to one of these attributes from done and this history of our secures in Ezekiel chapter 48 the very last last important of Ezekiel last chapter where Ezekiel kind of takes you 30 of you kind of read in Ezekiel 36 I'm talking about getting the new birth um and I think this is equal 37 that talks about the restoration the drive off with bones coming into being restored the restoration of vegetables the son of man Ezekiel 38 maybe the arm again and you can just keep following old up till we get to the last chapter in this book talks about well the last few chapters talks about this city that that Isaiah talked about the spoken over in Revelation the city that will be and it says here this last verse and the name of the city from that day shall be that's kind of see you gotta stop cheating they change something on you that's the mind of a second [Applause] No you could say you've been blessing the bed alright so so as Ethan was describing this city here in the last chapter and these are the ones out of the city and how the gates all are and all the different things and and kind of describing that he says it was around about eighteen eighteen thousand majors in the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there and that and if you look in the original Hebrew it's translated the original Hebrew is jehova shamma which means the Lord is there so what what what what I'm really getting at this morning is that the Lord has taken us through a process where the end of this process you can say the Lord is there and it really that's a almost you could say the difference between the revelation of that they had in the Old Testament and the Old Testament they could point at the tabernacle and say the Lord is there they could fall in a particular place and the Garden of Eden they could point say well the Lord is there they think and but now in the New Testament you you're looking at at a different abiding place I guess that we can say the Lord the Lord is the question is where is the Lord not the Lord as it is people exactly come on so the creatures that talk about the presence of the Lord that in some chapter forty states to the chief musician for the sons of korah says for God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble see all these things are kinda you can look at that's kind of under the umbrella of jehova shamma that he said he's there he's a president help just like he was there when Abraham off went went to offer his son Isaac he was there to provide a sacrifice he was there in his present and in Matthew 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world when he gives you the new birth ease they're constantly residing with you present with you always and he would just he's there to fight your battles he's there to take care of you then in Hebrews chapter 13 he says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake me so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper now I will not fear what man shall do unto me do you think about what a comfort it is to know that God is there that he's with you that he's never gonna leave you easy he's abiding with you continually that no matter what obstacles and things that you go through he's there to help you and to see that you that you overcome to see you through this process but you know the just kind of adding a little contact before I get what I really want to do this morning it's kind of go through the tabernacle and the wilderness and go through the journey that it takes to get you into that into where you can say that that God is there he's abiding within me and look at all the different the different pieces of furniture just a high level overview there's so many things that you dive in the dependency in this journey of a believer but really the journey started when when our relationship with God was separable severed in the in the the relationship the way that it should be was severed in the Garden of Eden when Eve disbelieve one Word of God and the Bible says in Genesis chapter three so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life in other words to keep man from from being able to fellowship with God in that way who was there was a barrier put up so that to prevent you the man from being able to eat because if he did if you really that you would live forever because the tree of life the Tree of Life is where we get our system is from and and so you know even even in the tabernacle you can see those terrible men the world leading to the veil opening to the curtain because now the thing that was driving the the thing that we're driving us away from the tree of life now is driving us back to the victory of life back to fellowship with God back to the true Fellowship so looking at the Garden of Eden I just kind of imagined for it where Adam and when he got driven driven out Adam and Eve got driven out of there out of the Garden of Eden just kind of an it tight maybe he look back and and remember that fellowship that he got to experience when you know the Bible talks about God coming down and the cool of the evening and fellowship when and sharing with him knowledge of himself and opening up the mysteries and talking to him about things and maybe Adam would look back and remember that fellowship that he couldn't get back to and so you say well maybe just kind of imagine wearing one of those God where is he now we get back to that fellowship so that's the question that that has been answered apps down through the ages and where is God and just to kind of put back in your mind what we're talking about is jehova shamma God is there the Lord is there so that's the answer to the question where is it who ever said show us the father it will suffice as he said and I would like to take four ways that we can see God and prove the gunner's right here in this building because that's you know that's the that's the role of the ministry it's to open the eyes of the people to the presence of a living God the reality that he is he is among us just open our eyes so that we could see him just like Elijah told to his servant he prayed to God that God would open up his eyes so that he could see the presence of God all around him that he was there ready to fight their battles and I believe that one of the reasons why we come to church is so that so that we can kind of be quickened with it will be stirred up a little bit to see that God is with us God is able to fight our battles in that God and his universe and God his word God in his son and God in his people so if want to know where God is God is in his people and don't wake Jesus forever said today that's what happens to the churches we talk about it we have so much intellectual Atilla men are so trained to the scripture so they can bring a message that will be can't lay a finger on it but where is God that's what I want to know where is that manifestation see that in other words in other words we're going through a process going through this what I'm going to get into talking about the tabernacle we're going through a process and the process to have a a supernatural understanding of God we want to be able to seek our who he is and now I'm talking about it it's good and and you know a lot of explanations good oratory all that's good but we're all I think everybody from the bottom to the top the young people that old people everybody is is hungry and thirsty to see God make manifest in their life right so the question where is God and brother my brother man man you in Matthew chapter 24 it says this this very premise scripture that brother Wayne and all the different ministers have been speaking all the different times then defeating Beata sayin that you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets that shall show great signs and wonders it's so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect the whole life told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not for behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not because why because you've got a revelation of jehova shamma you know where he is and where is he and that's this where I'm going you're gonna do the same way into the secret chain because he's saying if somebody says there's a secret chamber where you go find God for a particular church or a particular place that you can go don't believe it because you should have an understanding that God is living inside that that is where he is that's where Java Shama the Lord is there in that place so in the Old Testament the residing place of God was in that secret chamber of the Holy of Holies and at court corsican PO we know that he can manifest himself to Joshua with a man with a sword drawn in his hand and all those kind of things coming someone you know no I don't get he was constrained by like that little box that he was only I only living in that place but that was where the Israelites that was where Jonah in the belly of the whale and look to that holy polling says the the type of where God was making himself manifested so when they were following that that pillar of fire through the wilderness a pillar of fire wasn't manifested over that holy of holies that over that part of the Covenant where the word was but in the New Testament you he's he's not residing in that little place anymore he's residing and inside of your heart and not in that secret chamber of the Old Testament but in the secret chamber of your heart is where he's residing where he's seated on that mercy seat on the seat of your heart you see and and so but but looking back to the Old Testament you can get an understanding of where you are positionally by looking at the journey of the high priest as he went through the tabernacle so that's what we're going to do secret chamber means it up in the Greek lexicon Amin's a storage chamber or an inner chamber a secret room and and you can see that the presence of the nullifier this picture this hanging upstairs outside of the sanctuary that you know just imagine the Torah visually looking at that knowing that God was in their presence jehova shamma that the Lord is there and I believe in the New Testament that's got to be the revelation that the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that God is residing in your heart that he is there that you have a confidence that he is there because of the Old Testament donto losses he said let them make me a sanctuary that I'll make dwell according to all that I shall show thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and pattern of all the instruments they're looking so sexy making such how you make it big God wanted to dwell among them but now in the New Testament swelling in us and so you can see let's look at this picture of the tower I just want to show because of some different views of it so you can see that is its root actually really simple it's really plain in this construction but it's it showed this this is the pattern the pattern of how a believer would come into fellowship with God and in the Old Testament they really didn't know that even understand all of the hidden meaning of the things that all of the different the worship that they were going through as a you know Bart was sacrificing and went into the high priest went into the Holy of Holies but now the New Testament we can look back at whether it be much deeper understanding and really see what all these things mean so just kind of a layout of the tabernacle you really you could make it by the time you leave this morning you could have memorized all the different vessels that were in the tabernacle because you're coming maybe sometimes in your hand you think well there was so much going on but there was really only five or six vessels to and outside three of them in placing and and just one one piece of furniture and the Holy of Holies so you've got two pieces that offer the labor and then in the holy place the lampstand the table of shewbread and the altar of incense and then once you go past that veil you're into the Holy of Holies with the the cherubim the Ark of the Covenant and the mercy seat that table of stone and all of those things say you see the believer is taking the journey dark the tabernacle was facing eastward so you would be taking a journey westward just like the the revelation of Jesus Christ has gone from the east to the west you're taking a journey and westward into the kids of fellowship with God and what I think brother a moment hey he really opened to us our understanding that these three these three components are speaking of justification sanctification and the Baptist with all the goods and that's really the foundation of what we believe even so much that in we're gonna round preach the future home when he talked about how the earth is going through that same journey of justification sanctification the defenses with all the girls hey and you know many times we can kind of get in our head well this is very simple teaching but this is this is actually how we how we journey up the statue of a perfect man this is how we actually become close to the guys it's more than just the new birth just there's more to this than just when you just go through justification your sins we chopped off you go to the saint feature a little hole a lot and then you get there's more for this than just the new person that I but I believe that when we kind of get into this a little bit there that's one of the purposes of the fivefold ministry to identify the people to by the preaching of the gospel that there's more there's more to this than just being born again and there's more of this and then just the simplicity of say there's more to it there's a mysterious part of going through this process that unfolds as you grow and the knowledge of the word so justification of sanctification baptismal goes and we get that from Ezekiel 36 that says I will take you through a moment either the nowhere that's a my coming up they don't even he doesn't even know anything about the gospel they come up they hear about the word they come up with the that that like the first door to the tabernacle and and they come in and the priests are offering sacrifices and they're wondering about what's going on and and they begin to go through this journey and he says then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and here's the three stages a new heart walk along give you and a new spirit while I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an which and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and duty and so you can take each one of those steps and apply it to a different part of going through that Tabernacle does that make sense you see in the Old Testament the tabernacle was where God abided but in the New Testament God is dwelling in you which that we could see in 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath wrought righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with Belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people see I think I think that kind of informs the way that we live our life if you realize that God is Tabernacle inside of you it will change the way that you approach other people the way that you deal with problems the way that you you know even talking about the younger one you get some money to realize that God wants to tabernacle itself himself inside of you and literally let your hands and use your eyes to talk to other people to help help their other burdens and and it puts you into service that kind of changes our approach a little bit 1st Corinthians chapter 16 and talking to the Corinthians that were that we're not really you know they were maybe maybe a really good example of people who did not realize maybe the extent that God wanted to live inside them he said no you're not they you're the temple of God the Spirit of God dwelleth in you If any man to follow the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy which temple you are and so if we are the temple then the temples gotta be filled right so that's what all scripture talks about building its employees go back in and look read about suitable building the temple after they came out of the Babylonian destruction in Ephesians chapter 2 that's what Paul was talking about we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord and he also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit another skip through that is to not save time to let me that plus creeping Hill me but all of this is tempted to kind of give the church to to get the believer to a place to to realize that God is a body so brother Rama and Christ the mystery God reveal said what is the new birth in you say well brother Branham what is the Negro it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you I believe that revelation is the revelation of Jehovah Shalom that he is there living inside of unity because when he reveals himself to you begins to open up the word and transforms your life giving gives you overcoming power the power of the devil in 1955 over I'm said except the more man be born again you cannot understand the kingdom of heaven there's no way of understanding it until you're born again and then God reveals himself to you and then you know that you've passed from death unto life because no man can call Jesus to Christ only by the whole experience so looking at this this this picture of the tabernacle again we got one three four five six six pieces of furniture in this that described the believers journey through the tabernacle now what one reason not only kind of stressed the importance of this is you know as the word begins open up when we preach a lot of times about how we're you know we're we're almost like everybody is in the Holy of Holies and we preached it or look at it another way everybody is in maybe not just a new growth experience but everybody it always come up to the capstone but that's not necessarily that's not the case I'm not gonna say necessarily the case I think we we can be convinced that everybody is at different levels so when you have the minister and whatever appreciate from whatever position they are when we preach it the son of man is being revealed today God is in flesh and those kind of things but but that might not be the truth for you yet if you're still going through this process and so a lot of times people can get they get all stirred up and say well I'm already at an adoption or where I'm already had this placement but to know that you're at the wherever you are you have to identify yourself with these different markers with these different places that identify the place that you have gone through the journey that you've known through like life went up when ruthless was talking to Oster our mother lost tour marked the place where boa has lives and marked the place because when you mark the place where it could come from then you can kind of you can have an idea where you are and your spiritual growth moves on you could have you can have an understanding where you are the stench your perfect man or if you're 48 or if you're not more you know kind of where you are in this journey because at each of these places something is happening in the life of a believer so you know you've got three stages of your experience this your experience because a lot of times we're going to looking at somebody else's experience they try to place where they are but you know when the high priest went into the Holy of Holies he can only go behind himself and with God has made us kings and priests and when you make this dirty as a priest you you're making it alone you're going through the outer corner for Holy of Holies by yourself and the only the only way that you can measure where you are in this journey is by looking into the world from the outer form to the holy place until the Holy of Holies so I know maybe this sometimes this Gila can be a little bit mysterious and everything but I just kind of want to some like one scripture a little bit and look more at maybe some some strange ways that Paul talked about some of these things because in Romans chapter 8 29 he says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified you see there's a mysterious part of justification there's a mysterious part of sanctification that we can seep in and begin to understand by looking at this at this tabernacle picture and the third seal brother n said just take this like ticket on the other side that was people come in who has that power as kings there was a king's you have to notice the Bible turn the terminology of anything now watch but the reason all the strain ian's of the mysterious part of our justification the mysterious part of sanctification the mysterious part of the baptism it only goes oh all of these come and he's talking about this mysterious part what's the mysterious part and the power of transformation Bertram said now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the natural things of life and we brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's Spirit by His Word in other words after you go through justification sanctification of the Baptist in the Holy Ghost and your soul is residing in harmony with God your soul has been made eternal that's not the end of the story there's more to it and the mysterious part is that now you've got power to overcome now keep rolling growing and paint let the Word of God transform your mind so there's a lot more to this than just the simplicity of justification sanctification back to the Holy Ghost so we start off at this broth at this brazen altar because we're justified by faith in in the work that Jesus already did for us and that's why this is the very first thing the very first thing is you coming in a sacrifice had to be made when you come in to the tabernacle when you come into that brazen office the very first thing you see and you've got to get that taken care of first because our report is justification so you're repeating exactly if you you're looking at the sacrifice that Jesus made for you and and believing that and identifying yourself with it like like for example rogram set a table not only you know tae-hee offered up that Lana Manette altar and he crawled up there with it this kind of is his story for him to identify himself whether he laid his own life on that altar so see this altar represents more maybe than just Jesus offering up this sacrifice but the Israelites they would continue the green that would bring in their wheat offering and we constantly offering up things offering up themselves it's pretty like that they were constantly as part of their worship when you come to church your sacrifice into the Lord when you want any kind of when you get up in the morning and you don't feel like I'm in a church or coming to Bible study or going to the fellowship meetings or fellowship when your brothers or sisters you're making a sacrifice because the whole Christian journey is based upon sacrifice name it's based upon you God died for you and now you become a prisoner of Christ you've died to yourself so that God can live inside you assume the first part of your eternity is to recognize that Jesus died for you and have confidence in that and see every other part of this of the tabernacle is based upon upon that when you when you go into the golden offer in the hole the only place to burn incense you got to take fire from this altar to burn incense on that offer so everything starts with this offer everything is based upon your faith in what Jesus has done for you that course you know program if you come back to listen to the sermon into the Intervale and he talks about how you cannot you don't come to God based upon like it's crying and screaming and all this thing that's based upon of the your faith in what Jesus has already done free so the brazen offer is the first of many vessels every vessel had its role just like every believer in the church has a roll they have to fulfill every vessel in this sanctuary had a different hats like like waypoints through the journey of a believer it was lit by the fire of God to show that the sacrifice was accepted and and everything everything was based upon that it's virus collected the varnish that's only golden offer in the blood of the sacrifice you sprinkled on the mercy seat and so then you come to this to this this labor or the washing place where the word is it begins to wash you and cleanse you because you've got to be washed before you can go into the holy place now there's a labor this labor signifies a lot of different things that signifies the washing of the word that signifies that you don't you baptize of course you're not you're not saved because you were baptized but a believer is good be identified with Jesus Christ in those so you're going to go down in the water because you want to go be identified in the death of the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ because the scripture say this repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's kind [Music] let's dig some of it see after the offer before the door is delayed and after watching for the priest after washing their hands of the feet did the priest can minister at the altar of the holy place or the holy place so you got you better have faith in the sacrifice that Jesus died for you first then get cleansed and then you can go into service and they have to watch every time they entered it was a continual washing just like the word is continually cleansing the believer the the Bible says in John 15:3 now you are clean to the word without spoken to any Titus 3 5 6 is not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost in Hebrews 10:22 says let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water and we know of course and that's also speaking of that the ashes of the red heifer that will sprinkle on the believer to purify them which which also types the word the red heifer being a perfect sacrifice being sprayed on the believer so there's there's so many different times but but also speaking that labor speaking of being baptized because as priests unto God we must be first baptized confess our sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ watching you our sins and then you shall receive you the gift of the Holy Ghost lost first and then anointed for the service but then you have a right to enter into the holy place where you you're entering into a sanctified condition and this is where you know it can kind of get a lot of times people stagnate in this in this place because there's a lot going home in the holy place there's more furniture here than there is any other in any other part of the tabernacle and you're living a holy life you're living a play a life where you're looking into the Bible come on now that's a blessing into some deep understanding the Bible says in John 17:17 is sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth in Ephesians 5:25 says husband's love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word and so you're clear that when you're in there in that holy place you're eating the work because you've got there's the table of shewbread on the right when you're either in the table of showbread setup and what is the table of showbread as you study in the Bible it's the word laying out on the table and we gather around at that table we fellowship over the word and we ask questions like a Bible study we come to Bible study where we're sitting over this we're feasting on that on that table of showbread because the showbread was reserved only for the priests but we have been made kings and priests so we know a right to iterate like David who ate the showbread which was not lawful for just anybody to eat except the priests why was David allowed to lead the celebrating because it's a type of you and I going in there maybe you're not a minister or anything but still you have a right to eat that word of God you have a right to eat of this because God has made by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ he's made a way be able to enter in and partake of these things that in the Old Testament worship reserved only for the priests the table display the Twitter loaves of bread that were prepared every Sabbath the type of Christ killing eaten by the priests and John chapter 6 35 Jesus said I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst I am The Living bread which came down from God out of heaven If any man any of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world and so and then you've got on the left-hand side you've got the candlesticks the seven golden candlesticks which we're sitting there and brother Adam talked about in the interval and other messages how and the outer core the light of the Sun or the moon depending whether it's day or night will give you light it can get dark at night and out of court and so there's not it's changing same thing in the only place you've got a different you've got like a there's a is it a ire form of life but still it's not a permanent life like you get in the holy people in the Holy of Holies that's a light that has to be continuously maintained sometimes they can go out and get smoke and you got to trim those lamps but see that's what and the only place sometimes we get really excited when we go for a bomb or something we get out we go to special meetings and we get all pumped up and everything in the light it's really burning bright but then when we come back in the world it gets all smoky and everything and we're like that what well I feel down everything you got going there and trim the lamp and everything and kind of keep everything maintained but that light is different than the light that is in the Holy of Holies which is the Shekinah glory a permanent light that's always shining so you see in the golden lampstand one it's shown on that table of shewbread so there's a light shining on that you're eating in that holy place it gives light to the word now what it is this your light and your testimony is are going through that sanctified condition which like you said could be could be you're not moving it in but it could be you have been going in and you're going up the Statue of a perfect magnet you're going up to that of the second the second pole but it must be kept trimmed and maintaining the Psalm 27 the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid and Ephesians chapter 5 says for he were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the world walk as children of light and brother said best to the man who quits his drinking twist his smoker twist line quit stealing treats his neighbor right good to his wife are good to her hooking the same way men and woman the believer he's come into a place where he split out of his meanness which is through the blood of sanctification he's called to a new life and he's walked and he walks in there but you're not hid away if you're not behind the veil depending where you are that could mean different than that means different things because there's a mysterious part of justification there's a mysterious part of sanctification and maybe that's something to ponder on what does that mean see before you're born again you you you quit your smoking and there's a light this shining out from that holy place of the life there's a a light a light of a good sanctified life shining out but yet you have not yet entered into the holy place and then he talks about how you got you got to keep it real and you can't get all smoky and everything and then we come to the golden altar it's a very interesting piece of furniture the golden officers when you burn the incense on the bottle always types with prayer because when you pray you're confessing was hard to happen on that altar that brazen altar outside a lot of people think that prayer is like begging and everything that prayer is your confession of your faith before God will read the second samuel where the way that they would prayed was he said do according to your promises he didn't come into the bed is screaming and clean like a little child he came in with authority no one that he who he believed because he need to look back to that brazen altar and he knew that god that there was a sacrifice laying on that altar that's why you cannot maybe have a nabob who came into there and owned that gold and off they tried to burn a strange fire instead of taking from the fire off of the brazen altar they tried to burn a fire that they had done from somewhere else but if you think if you take the revelation of the faith that you know that Jesus Christ has died for you and put it on that altar and let that go up as a sweet savour before the Lord and then he'll hear your prayer it was offered after the morning at eat these sacrifices the incense on that golden offer and and they mixed up that incident I did I put a note here though don't hurry when you offer it when you're offering up your ago you're innocent you take time to mix it up real good take time to you come before that own offering favorite but you like you know a lot of people say well I don't need I don't need to spend any time in prayer they think it they get that it's like almost like saying that they have nothing to be thankful for they have nothing to praise God for that they have don't have time to to confess to the Lord what they believe that he has done for them so when you get alone with God and you begin to speak back to him the things that he's already said then that gives an opportunity for him to speak back to you so don't don't worry mix-up that is take time the big study in cents up your Thanksgiving and your praise and your prayer which is your product confession before God let my prayer in subchapter kidsongs chapter one for you so one for once and let my prayer be set before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands is the evening sacrifice the dew Bible says some more things about prayer in Colossians chapter 4 we continue in prayer and watching the same with Thanksgiving I'm gonna wrap up here just a second the Jude says building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost and second signal they even tells us how to pray the word that thou has spoken is certainly that server establish it forever and do as thou has seen that's how we pray and in Revelation chapter 8 and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hand and I'm running out of time so we're gonna stop right there how about Thanksgiving [Music]
