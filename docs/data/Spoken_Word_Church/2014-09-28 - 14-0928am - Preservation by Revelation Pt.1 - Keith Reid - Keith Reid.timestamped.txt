[6:21] he just had a sore on his lip okay but
[6:23] we just kidding about it amen so are you
[6:25] ready for hearing the word of the lord
[6:27] because we're ready to remember peggy
[6:29] now why she's still having problems up
[6:31] and down she has good days and bad and
[6:33] that's understandable right now of going
[6:35] through and up and down and last night
[6:38] she did get to sleep in the bed all
[6:39] night long but when she tries to roll
[6:42] and turn
[6:43] it it hurts her and you know you
[6:45] automatically roll and turn during the
[6:47] night you don't realize you do but you
[6:49] do and it it hurts her a lot so she just
[6:52] stayed at home this morning be this
[6:53] afternoon with us
[6:55] and they all go all right let's just
[6:56] sing open the eyes of my heart
[6:58] as brother keith reed from jamaica comes

[8:42] amen just glad to be in the house of the
[8:44] lord and
[8:45] it's a great privilege to be with the
[8:47] people of god

[8:51] glad when they said to me let us go into
[8:53] the house
[8:54] of the lord amen and i thank god from
[8:58] my youth
[8:59] i've learned to trust him i've learned
[9:01] to serve him
[9:03] somebody said well the girls were here
[9:05] and now we're here amen and we don't
[9:08] sing like them we don't you know do like
[9:11] them amen we're just a little holder and
[9:14] slow but we're certainly glad to be in
[9:15] your midst and um i'm glad to see the
[9:18] wonderful faces and um people haven't
[9:20] seen for a long time
[9:22] amen god bless you sir amen and so we
[9:25] certainly appreciate you just trust that
[9:27] the word of god
[9:28] because that's what brought us together
[9:30] the word of god amen had it not built
[9:32] for the word of god and the revelation
[9:34] we have in this day we would not have
[9:36] known each other amen but we thank god
[9:39] that he has sent us a word
[9:41] in this day and he said he said his word
[9:43] to heal us
[9:44] amen praise god so this morning we want
[9:46] to look at the word we want to go to the
[9:48] book of genesis chapter
[9:51] 41
[9:52] and we we want to take a look in the the
[9:54] life of joseph this morning
[9:58] and then after uh we're going to the
[10:00] book of revelation chapter 3
[10:03] so we first read from genesis
[10:06] uh 41 i'm going to read from verse 33
[10:11] just trust god the word of god would be
[10:13] a blessing to you this morning
[10:15] because one thing we want to do you know
[10:17] brother branham preached modern events
[10:19] made clear by the prophecies that we
[10:21] have
[10:22] we we certainly want to go to the world
[10:24] and we want to look at the day that
[10:25] we're living in and to see how these
[10:28] things that were said that are there in
[10:31] the scripture and to look at the time so
[10:33] we can know the spiritual clock
[10:35] that god has exactly
[10:38] where we are
[10:39] let us just bow with our heads as we
[10:41] find it
[10:43] our gracious god and our father
[10:46] lord we know god the greatest prophet
[10:48] said that a man could do is get himself
[10:50] out of the way
[10:52] and lord god we pray this morning the
[10:54] lord god our
[10:56] personality doesn't stand before you
[10:59] lord our person oh god don't come before
[11:01] you this morning
[11:03] but lord god may you as you promised be
[11:05] glorified behind skin this morning
[11:08] lord we said if you would send the
[11:09] anointing to speak o god to your
[11:11] children
[11:12] because lord god our backgrounds are
[11:15] different the things we go to are
[11:17] different but we've got one thing in
[11:19] common this morning god and lord you are
[11:22] that oh personal god that stand before

[11:31] god we pray that you'll be manifested
[11:34] and glorified oh god behind our skins
[11:37] this morning the lord god he who speak
[11:40] and he will hear would become one in
[11:42] your god
[11:43] the lord jesus we can hear your word and
[11:47] and see you manifested in flesh
[11:49] as we look at the things that we go
[11:51] through in this day oh god
[11:53] bless us we pray and bring all things to
[11:56] our remembrance as we speak o god
[11:59] bless your children and father we pray
[12:01] that you you give the back to them in
[12:03] abundance oh god to what they have given
[12:06] to us god and lord god may your
[12:08] fellowship be sweet together
[12:10] lord god
[12:12] may the love of the brother would
[12:13] continue god while we're on this side of
[12:16] glory the lord god nothing will be done
[12:19] through pride or or vain glory but lord
[12:22] god may we lift you up oh god in all our
[12:25] doing
[12:26] the lord god you'll be well pleased with
[12:29] our lives
[12:30] bless us now as we look to you and
[12:31] believe you in jesus name we pray amen
[12:36] and amen
[12:38] and so we read from verse 33 i just want
[12:41] to pick a portion that we read
[12:45] because we're going to follow
[12:47] just a little bit
[12:51] now therefore let pharaoh
[12:55] look out a man discreet and wise
[12:58] and send him over the land of egypt
[13:01] let pharaoh do this and let him appoint
[13:04] officers over the land
[13:06] and take up the the fifth part of the
[13:09] land of egypt in the seventh plenteous
[13:11] years
[13:12] and let them together all the food
[13:15] of those good years that come
[13:18] and lay up corn under the hand of
[13:20] pharaoh and let them keep food in the
[13:23] cities
[13:24] and that food shall be for store in the
[13:27] land against the seven years of famine
[13:30] which shall be in the
[13:32] land of egypt that the land perished not
[13:36] through the famine
[13:37] and the thing was good in the eyes of
[13:40] pharaoh and in the eyes of all his
[13:42] servant
[13:43] and pharaoh said unto his servant
[13:46] can we find such a one as this is a man
[13:50] in whom the spirit of god is
[13:54] and pharaoh said unto joseph
[13:56] for as much
[13:58] as god as show thee all this god now
[14:02] pharaoh an unbeliever
[14:04] believing that god has shown this to
[14:07] joseph
[14:09] there is none so discreet and wise
[14:12] as there are
[14:15] thou shall be over my house
[14:19] and according unto thy word
[14:21] shall all my people be rule
[14:24] only in the throne
[14:26] will i be greater than thou is now at
[14:29] the right hand of pharaoh amen
[14:32] hallelujah
[14:34] and pharaoh said unto joseph see
[14:37] i have set thee over all
[14:39] the land of egypt
[14:42] then over in revelation chapter 3
[14:46] and i read verse 7 then i go to verse
[14:49] 10
[14:51] and to the end
[14:56] revelation chapter 3
[14:58] the philadelphia church age
[15:02] and to the angel of the church of
[15:03] philadelphia write these things
[15:06] said he that is holy
[15:08] he that is true and he that have the key
[15:11] of david
[15:13] either open a no man shot and shot and
[15:16] no man open verse 10
[15:20] because that was kept the word of my
[15:23] patience
[15:25] i will keep thee from the hour of
[15:28] temptation
[15:29] that hour
[15:30] that joseph would tell pharaoh that's
[15:33] going to come
[15:34] i will keep thee
[15:36] through that hour amen
[15:38] which shall come upon all the world to
[15:41] try them that dwell upon the earth
[15:44] they will i come quickly
[15:46] hold fast that which thou has that no
[15:49] man take thy crown right him that
[15:51] overcometh will i make a pillow in the
[15:55] temple of my god
[15:56] and he shall go no more out and i will
[16:00] write upon him the name of my god
[16:03] and the name of the city of my god which
[16:07] is new jerusalem
[16:08] which come down out of heaven from my
[16:11] god
[16:12] and i will write upon him my new name
[16:15] he that athen here
[16:18] let him hear what the spirit says
[16:21] the churches may the lord add his
[16:23] blessing to the word you may be seated
[16:27] we certainly want to thank god for the
[16:28] word that has been preserved for us
[16:31] we thank him for the written word
[16:34] and yet we thank him for the word that
[16:36] has been revealed in this day that we're
[16:38] living in
[16:39] amy we want to thank god for the the
[16:41] modern events of our day
[16:44] we want to thank god that we can look in
[16:46] the pages of the word and we can see
[16:48] these things coming to pass that was
[16:50] spoken even before to us really then we
[16:54] know that the word of god is the truth
[16:57] i mean we know that god was mindful of
[16:59] us even before we come to a place like
[17:03] this amen that there is therefore to the
[17:06] bride there's nothing new to us i mean
[17:09] but god was mindful of us he was mindful
[17:12] of our placing i mean god was mindful of
[17:14] the things that we see you know we see
[17:17] the the economy is changing we see other
[17:20] things happening out there in the world
[17:21] and god is mindful of everything that we
[17:24] go through this morning i'd like to
[17:25] speak you know on
[17:27] preservation
[17:29] through
[17:30] revelation amen
[17:32] we we saw that in the the life of david
[17:36] and and one thing we want i want to lay
[17:38] a foundation on we find that the book of
[17:41] genesis parallels the book of revelation
[17:45] and and there so therefore we can say
[17:47] that that the law of genesis is a law of
[17:51] revelation
[17:52] what was there in genesis it was really
[17:54] repeated in the book of revelation for
[17:57] us really
[17:58] and so that genesis becomes not just
[18:00] history it becomes not just the story of
[18:03] the bible but it becomes that which god
[18:06] did hallelujah and and then in the book
[18:08] of revelation now we pick these things
[18:11] for our day and we look at what happened
[18:13] in genesis and we know exactly what the
[18:16] outcome would be
[18:18] is that right so so we we know that in
[18:21] genesis there were seven church ages in
[18:24] revelation there were seven church ages
[18:27] you know jesus uh there in matthew you
[18:29] look at the seven seals uh i mean there
[18:32] in revelation there were seven seals is
[18:34] that right we find in genesis we find
[18:37] adam and eve in the garden of eden amen
[18:40] there in revelation we find the bride
[18:42] and christ
[18:44] in the kingdom age of god is that right
[18:47] amen so we find there in genesis we find
[18:50] an enoch is that right and enough walk
[18:53] with god
[18:54] in the revelation we can pick out now an
[18:56] enoch that will walk with god
[18:59] is that right amen we find in genesis
[19:01] there was an eleazar amen in this day we
[19:04] find also an eleazar that has come to us
[19:09] amen that has called us out from where
[19:11] we are and we know that we're going on
[19:13] to our isaac
[19:15] amen and we find there in genesis that
[19:18] there was a a civilization and it might
[19:21] be you know way just more like this one
[19:24] that we're in now there was a great
[19:26] scientifical scientific civilization
[19:30] whereby they built the pyramids and all
[19:32] of that and we find now we're moving
[19:35] from the scientific
[19:37] civilization and we're moving now into a
[19:40] civilization of fate by the word of god
[19:44] for all day
[19:45] hallelujah amen so we can see the
[19:48] parallels that there is in the word of
[19:50] god we see exactly what god wanted to do
[19:54] and how god did it and we see god
[19:56] fulfilling his word to us really
[19:59] no no
[20:00] joseph
[20:02] his life was a life of god bringing him
[20:05] to a placing
[20:08] and so we find there in the word of god
[20:10] that when god called him and the first
[20:12] thing that god does is give him the
[20:15] revelation of his placing
[20:17] you you know joseph he his father gave
[20:20] him a court of many colors
[20:23] and and by this that he was given him
[20:25] and then you know he started to have
[20:27] dreams
[20:28] and visions aiming by by this process of
[20:32] his life that he was going through
[20:34] and so he had two dreams and he began to
[20:37] tell his brethren about his dream you
[20:39] know and they said what are you trying
[20:41] to say that you're going to rule over us
[20:44] and he had a dream and he tell us to his
[20:46] father and his father said come on
[20:48] joseph what are you trying to say
[20:50] are you saying that your your mother and
[20:52] i are going to bow down to you
[20:55] you see joseph could get further than
[20:57] that he was merely saying
[21:00] what god had showed to him and and
[21:02] that's right
[21:03] and to them it seems far-fetched it's
[21:06] because of the sons though his father
[21:10] loved him
[21:11] to his brethren he was the least among
[21:14] them
[21:16] but god was with him
[21:18] is it right
[21:19] hallelujah
[21:20] so you know we find that the dreams
[21:24] what what dreams of his place in god was
[21:28] showing him
[21:29] is placing there in those dreams
[21:32] and if you watch the way that god does
[21:34] this thing
[21:35] when samuel
[21:37] anoint david he said to him you're going
[21:41] to be king
[21:43] the anointing
[21:44] brings the placing
[21:47] is that right amen when elijah amen you
[21:50] pass that robe over to elijah he said a
[21:54] double portion of what is on me
[21:56] it's gonna come upon you
[21:58] it's placing he knows
[22:01] exactly what he's gonna do when when god
[22:03] called out abraham he said i'm gonna
[22:06] make you the father of a nation
[22:09] he knows exactly what it's going to be
[22:13] and brother branham you see there in the
[22:15] ministry when god called him out
[22:18] he said if you would get the people to
[22:21] believe you
[22:23] hello
[22:24] nothing is going to stand before your
[22:26] pearls
[22:27] you know brother branham said in the
[22:28] message as i was with moses he said i
[22:31] was to be brought forth he said because
[22:32] when god said that i say they won't
[22:35] believe me and he said because of that i
[22:38] will give you two signs
[22:41] is that right but but he said he comes
[22:43] later he said listen i haven't come past
[22:45] this mountain long enough
[22:47] it's not in the signs it's in the
[22:49] commission
[22:51] amen
[22:53] hallelujah and he said if i if he kept
[22:55] his eyes on the sign he missed the
[22:57] commission
[22:58] and so you know he had to make a turn
[23:00] because he had to go back him into the
[23:02] commission that god had given to him
[23:06] so we find then that even when we look
[23:08] at the pyramid
[23:09] fate
[23:10] is a revelation

[24:15] we can look at the pages of the word and
[24:17] the message even the bible becomes a new
[24:19] book
[24:20] we don't read it like we used to read it
[24:23] no sorry ephesians 2 tells me that i'm
[24:25] quickened
[24:27] i already know that i'm quickened
[24:30] corinthians 3
[24:32] 18 tells me that i'm change

[24:41] is that right it's right there in the
[24:44] word of god amen we don't take it the
[24:47] way they used to take it we take it now
[24:49] by revelation
[24:51] so so i said i'm quickened and changed
[24:54] and translated because it's there in the
[24:57] anointing of my new birth
[24:59] is that right
[25:01] everything that i've got need of
[25:03] is right there
[25:06] so we find out that joseph
[25:10] when we come to him at this point he was
[25:12] in prison
[25:14] hallelujah
[25:15] and he was in prison
[25:18] for the word of god
[25:20] he was accused of falsely
[25:23] amen but what god was doing is going to
[25:25] now show him amen from restoration and
[25:29] judgment
[25:31] and so while he was there in prison i
[25:33] mean there was a butler and there was a
[25:36] baker right and both of them had dreams
[25:40] and and so they tell joseph their my
[25:43] their cellmate what their dreams were
[25:46] amen one was restored
[25:49] and the other was judgment
[25:52] and so the butler said to joseph he said
[25:55] listen when i get out of here
[25:58] i'm going to bring up your name before
[26:00] pharaoh
[26:02] what a promise
[26:03] when i'm out of prison i'm going to talk
[26:05] about you but you know what he was out
[26:08] of prison and he forget all about joseph
[26:12] people do that sometimes
[26:14] they make you real good promises
[26:16] when i'm exalted i'm going to remember
[26:19] you but he was not exalted and he didn't
[26:21] remember him but god was on the job
[26:24] hallelujah
[26:26] we're not waiting on man's time we're
[26:28] waiting in god's time
[26:29] is that right and god's going to bring
[26:31] everything to pass
[26:33] is that right so he was fulfilling the
[26:36] measure
[26:37] of his suffering
[26:38] because he had to suffer before he come
[26:41] into reign
[26:43] is that right and sometimes we don't
[26:45] want it that way but that is god's way
[26:48] joseph was coming to his position and
[26:52] the way god did it
[26:54] is that right god you know i said many
[26:56] times he said if we would have looked at
[26:57] our lives in a vision
[27:00] and see the way that god would have
[27:02] bring us to our redemption we would
[27:04] start a cry oh no god don't do that
[27:07] it's a right
[27:08] but but god's gonna bring you there
[27:11] sometimes he's dropping off he he's
[27:13] cutting off things that are part of you
[27:15] that's got to go
[27:19] hallelujah
[27:20] and that is what was happening to joseph
[27:24] you know brother brahms said we got to
[27:25] trim off all the high will
[27:28] and i can
[27:29] amen in order to get into god because
[27:32] when you get there god wants you to know
[27:34] that it's not you
[27:36] it is not you it is him
[27:38] and the more you can rely upon him is
[27:41] the more you can read the promises
[27:44] of god
[27:45] hallelujah
[27:46] amen so we find
[27:49] him as we look at this life
[27:52] we find joseph
[27:54] him and there in prison
[27:57] and he was there because
[27:59] he was accused of rape
[28:02] yet he was innocent
[28:04] verse nine
[28:06] we we find i'm gonna read
[28:09] keep reading the scripture in genesis 41
[28:13] then spoke the chief butler on to fear
[28:16] of saying
[28:18] i do remember my fault
[28:21] fear and all i had this dream and in
[28:23] this dream the first time he had the
[28:25] dream and you know sometimes brother
[28:27] wait you can have a dream in the night
[28:29] and you know you you you wake up and you
[28:31] think about it
[28:33] and you go back to sleep and you've got
[28:35] another dream
[28:37] now here pharaoh he he was asleep and he
[28:40] had a dream and he had seen uh uh seven
[28:43] fat cows
[28:45] and then they were eaten up by seven uh
[28:48] thin cows
[28:49] and he woke up and he was confused
[28:52] and he went back to sleep again and
[28:55] and when he went back to sleep he didn't
[28:57] see he saw hears of corn
[29:00] seven
[29:01] a stall that had seven years of corn
[29:04] prosperity
[29:05] and then he'd seen one and so the dreams
[29:08] were related
[29:11] and pharaoh when he woke up he didn't
[29:13] know what it was
[29:15] right so fearono called for all his
[29:18] magicians and all of that and said if
[29:20] you can tell me what this is yeah right
[29:23] and none of them can tell
[29:26] hallelujah
[29:27] because they did not have the mind of
[29:29] god
[29:31] god was doing something
[29:33] and so the butler was there and he saw
[29:36] all of this
[29:38] and he said
[29:39] you know pharaoh i remember now my fault
[29:43] i think god hold that from him
[29:46] until the right time
[29:49] hallelujah
[29:51] pharaoh was wrought with a servant and
[29:54] put me in in ward in the in the captain
[29:57] of the gods house
[29:59] both me and the chief baker
[30:02] and we dream a dream in one night
[30:06] i and he
[30:09] we dreaming each man according to his
[30:11] interpretation of his dream and there
[30:13] was there and there
[30:15] and there was there
[30:18] with us a young man
[30:20] and hebrew servant of the captain of the
[30:23] god
[30:24] and we told him and he interpreted to us
[30:26] our dream
[30:28] and each one according to his dream he
[30:31] did interpret
[30:32] and it came to pass
[30:34] as interpret to us
[30:36] so was
[30:38] hallelujah me
[30:40] he restored unto my office
[30:43] and him he hang on hallelujah
[30:47] just like joseph

[48:06] which shall be in the land of egypt that
[48:09] the land perished not through the famine

[48:15] pharaoh and in the eyes of all the
[48:18] servant
[48:19] hallelujah
[48:21] amen
[48:23] and pharaoh said unto his servant
[48:25] can we find such a one as this
[48:28] a man in whom
[48:30] the spirit of god is
[48:34] i've already called all the magicians
[48:37] that they've called all the economy the
[48:40] economist of the world
[48:42] and they were trying to sort it out and
[48:45] and they didn't know what to do
[48:47] listen if they knew what they were doing
[48:50] 2008
[48:51] we wouldn't be having a crash
[48:54] hello
[48:56] because they had years of famine and all
[48:58] that they did they failed
[49:01] but prophecy has got to fulfill right
[49:04] now is that right
[49:06] amen
[49:08] they didn't know what they were doing
[49:09] right they all feel
[49:11] right so we're moving from that
[49:13] civilization
[49:15] we're moving from the scientific and
[49:17] we're getting into faith
[49:19] faith will be your substance
[49:22] is it right
[49:23] because if they would have done it
[49:25] we wouldn't have since 2008 to today we
[49:28] wouldn't have that time we wouldn't have
[49:30] that time where people are struggling to
[49:32] find jobs
[49:34] we wouldn't have that time of shutting
[49:35] down we wouldn't have time with people
[49:38] losing hundreds of thousands of dollars
[49:40] hello if they had known what they were
[49:43] doing but it had to come to that because
[49:45] it's prophecy
[49:47] hello
[49:48] genesis coming back to revelation
[49:51] and it's got to be fulfilled
[49:53] and so the hour of temptation has we so
[49:57] many out

[58:51] hallelujah
[58:52] and said samuel
[58:54] when you were a boy i called you
[58:56] and you didn't know where you were going
[58:58] and many times you think that you lost
[59:00] it but i was always on the job amen
[59:04] somebody
[59:05] oh that's where he was now
[59:08] and he took off his ring from his hand
[59:10] and he put it hallelujah
[59:12] put it
[59:14] hallelu and joseph and and array him
[59:16] investor of fine linen
[59:19] and put a guild chain
[59:21] about his neck
[59:24] adoption placing setting him
[59:26] positionally
[59:27] with authority
[59:29] is that right and i'll tell you god
[59:32] don't call you to lose you he didn't
[59:34] save you to lose you he will be
[59:36] defeating his purpose the fact that god
[59:39] called you has got a place for you
[59:40] somewhere amen sometimes those around
[59:43] you don't see it
[59:44] and they think that you're stupid they
[59:46] don't think they're going anywhere i
[59:48] mean but god is on the job and he know
[59:50] exactly what he's doing am i talking to
[59:53] somebody this morning
[59:56] hallelujah
[59:57] oh jesus i'm going there
[59:59] hallelujah and he made him to ride
[1:00:02] in the second chariot
[1:00:04] which he had
[1:00:06] and they cried before him
[1:00:09] and bow knees and and made him ruler
[1:00:12] over all over all the land of egypt
[1:00:16] hallelujah
[1:00:17] and pharaoh said unto joseph
[1:00:20] i want you to note this part pharaoh is
[1:00:23] saying to joseph i am pharaoh it is not
[1:00:26] that joseph don't know that this is
[1:00:29] pharaoh
[1:00:30] but he's stamping his authority
[1:00:33] he's now giving him not just position
[1:00:35] but authority
[1:00:37] and so when he gave him this authority
[1:00:39] he said now listen to me i am pharaoh
[1:00:44] i am not second in charge
[1:00:46] i'm not fair as well i am fairer
[1:00:50] he's stamping that authority because
[1:00:53] many times people get position and they
[1:00:56] ain't got no authority
[1:01:00] in management school they tell me it's
[1:01:02] wrong to do that
[1:01:03] if you give the man the position you got
[1:01:05] to give him the authority
[1:01:07] and god don't do it like that brother
[1:01:10] when god gives you the position of
[1:01:12] placing
[1:01:13] god gives you the authority
[1:01:16] and and god is even saying in the church
[1:01:18] let me move away from god is even saying
[1:01:20] in the church is there any sick among
[1:01:22] you
[1:01:24] hello you got any elders
[1:01:26] let them call for the elders of the
[1:01:29] church
[1:01:30] let them anoint them with oil
[1:01:32] and the prayer of faith come on shall
[1:01:35] save the sick
[1:01:37] and if they commit any sin it shall be
[1:01:40] forgiven
[1:01:41] that's authority
[1:01:43] that god has given to you
[1:01:45] is that right
[1:01:47] can those believe it
[1:01:49] oh hallelujah
[1:01:51] amen
[1:01:53] jesus
[1:01:54] hallelujah
[1:01:56] oh
[1:01:57] the second this is the second ride

[1:04:13] i just preached this back at home
[1:04:15] you know
[1:04:16] brother branham said in that message as
[1:04:18] i was with moses
[1:04:20] so will i be with you
[1:04:22] he said when he he said to me if you
[1:04:26] would get the people to believe you
[1:04:28] i say
[1:04:30] they will not believe me
[1:04:32] god didn't say that
[1:04:34] he said i say that
[1:04:37] he said because of this you'll be given
[1:04:38] two signs
[1:04:41] hallelujah
[1:04:42] and by these signs they would believe
[1:04:46] and he said the problem with the
[1:04:47] ministry
[1:04:48] is that they start to follow the signs
[1:04:51] and the commission
[1:04:53] was left behind
[1:04:55] and so 1960 says
[1:04:57] i've come past this mountain
[1:05:00] long enough
[1:05:01] you know brethren we come back to the
[1:05:03] same place
[1:05:04] in the second ride
[1:05:06] of the ministry of malachi 4.
[1:05:09] that we're following after
[1:05:11] but we're doubting the authority that is
[1:05:13] given to us to use
[1:05:16] hello somebody by the position that god
[1:05:19] has put us into
[1:05:21] is that right
[1:05:22] hallelujah
[1:05:24] and so you know we we come
[1:05:26] and i want to be touched i want to be
[1:05:28] poured i'll upon how i want everything
[1:05:31] to happen i remember when i was a child
[1:05:33] and and oral roberts used to be on the
[1:05:34] radio and he would have said put your
[1:05:36] hands on the radio i remember mama put
[1:05:38] her hands on the little old transistor
[1:05:40] radio i mean think that she's gonna draw
[1:05:43] fate from it
[1:05:44] but our commission
[1:05:46] oh the bible said well peter yet speak
[1:05:49] these words
[1:05:50] hello
[1:05:51] and here we are this morning the
[1:05:53] commission is already yours
[1:05:56] is saying his word to heal you why can't
[1:06:00] you believe
[1:06:02] it's a right so here now in genesis is
[1:06:06] telling joseph you are the joseph you
[1:06:09] are the perfection
[1:06:11] you are in the second chariot
[1:06:14] my word is in you i am pharaoh when i
[1:06:18] say oh jesus
[1:06:20] and he's saying to joseph
[1:06:22] joseph whatever you say
[1:06:25] whatever you say you know why it was
[1:06:27] important
[1:06:29] it wasn't the time pharaoh was saying it
[1:06:32] because if the feasts had not yet come
[1:06:36] but after those seven years of feasts
[1:06:38] and the famine struck
[1:06:40] what fear was no saying
[1:06:43] that's what is going to be important
[1:06:46] and so that's why we don't see it as
[1:06:48] important
[1:06:49] because if you're in the feast and it
[1:06:51] says there's a famine coming and you
[1:06:52] ain't seeing nothing yeah i didn't see
[1:06:54] nothing
[1:06:56] you just saying it
[1:06:58] but when that time come
[1:07:00] then you will know
[1:07:05] hallelujah
[1:07:07] are you with me
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:10] we got in our position
[1:07:13] she will finish the ministry of the son
[1:07:15] of man
[1:07:16] amen that that's her position
[1:07:19] you ain't going to come back and finish
[1:07:20] no
[1:07:21] go back and read some luke 17. right
[1:07:24] hallelujah it's in you the bride
[1:07:26] you're gonna finish the mysteries
[1:07:29] hallelujah
[1:07:30] yes sir
[1:07:32] what do you think the word is for every
[1:07:34] age that word is in you
[1:07:36] and the faith and the training
[1:07:38] hallelujah amen that you're here under
[1:07:41] him it's for a purpose
[1:07:43] the message is for preparation
[1:07:46] is that right it's not for coming to
[1:07:48] church
[1:07:49] it's not to go into fellowship meetings
[1:07:51] it's not to identify yourself we message
[1:07:54] people it's preparation for the other
[1:07:58] side because one day
[1:08:00] that which is inside of you you're going
[1:08:03] to speak
[1:08:04] come on brother
[1:08:06] hello that's why he was putting joseph
[1:08:09] in that position you're coming on to
[1:08:12] speak in terms because i give you that
[1:08:14] authority
[1:08:16] hello
[1:08:18] but we become afraid
[1:08:20] to exercise that which god has already
[1:08:23] given you
[1:08:24] we stand again like moses there at the
[1:08:27] red sea and crying because of people
[1:08:29] crying
[1:08:30] what are we going to do we might as well
[1:08:33] put our hands in the air and die
[1:08:35] we might as well just give up we might
[1:08:38] as well don't go no further we matter
[1:08:40] hello
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:47] without faith is impossible to please
[1:08:49] god
[1:08:50] hallelujah this is not your church
[1:08:54] feeling this oh yes brother keith i feel
[1:08:57] that brother keith oh yes i'm gonna move
[1:08:59] upon that
[1:09:01] you're gonna take the word of god

[1:09:08] everywhere
[1:09:10] hallelujah

[1:09:35] and he said they begin to put away the
[1:09:37] peanuts and you know get all your things
[1:09:39] together amen put because what i mean i
[1:09:42] see the light
[1:09:43] shining

[1:09:54] prepare ourselves all this time and now
[1:09:57] it's time we've got to go
[1:10:00] hallelujah brother branham was saying
[1:10:02] that that is a true throw away your
[1:10:04] peanut and everything else see the
[1:10:06] flashing red light of the sign of his
[1:10:09] coming
[1:10:10] and look up and lift up your your head
[1:10:12] because your redemption drawn nigh
[1:10:14] hallelujah
[1:10:16] amen

[1:10:20] hallelujah's place and time
[1:10:23] all that which you have
[1:10:25] amen brother branham hallelujah let me
[1:10:28] add that vesture amen it was dressed as
[1:10:31] chief amen but here you are now it is
[1:10:34] not your ride
[1:10:36] what the people try to do they take
[1:10:37] everything from the bride and and
[1:10:39] they're looking for the prophetic
[1:10:40] forerunner aiming to come on the scene
[1:10:42] again and to set up a tent and he's
[1:10:45] gonna do this and hey you're not going
[1:10:46] to see it that's right amen
[1:10:49] you might as well snap and wake up out
[1:10:51] of your dream because you ain't going to
[1:10:53] see it because what you see now that's
[1:10:55] it
[1:10:56] amen that's right and if you miss the
[1:10:59] first ride you're gonna miss the second
[1:11:00] ride
[1:11:02] amen and if you can't identify yourself
[1:11:04] in the first you'll never identify
[1:11:05] yourself in a second
[1:11:07] hallelujah amen you can walk around and
[1:11:09] say oh where the brother cries but
[1:11:11] you'll miss your authority and you ain't
[1:11:13] got nothing right right
[1:11:16] amen
[1:11:17] oh she's gonna be weak and powerless
[1:11:20] except she understand who she is
[1:11:22] hallelujah
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:26] hallelujah
[1:11:27] oh we got to come to our position
[1:11:30] is that right right amen
[1:11:33] the son of man
[1:11:34] that position
[1:11:36] hallelujah bride standing in the
[1:11:38] position of christ jesus tell them back
[1:11:41] then all they said but moses because
[1:11:43] that's the greatest authority that they
[1:11:44] could look back in the old testament but
[1:11:46] jesus said before hallelujah amen he
[1:11:49] said moses give you but i say unto you
[1:11:52] are greater than moses was standing
[1:11:54] there
[1:11:55] the queen of the south but a greater
[1:11:56] than solomon is here
[1:11:59] amen a greater than jonah is here you've
[1:12:02] got to recognize present tense where we
[1:12:04] are hallelujah the one that's in our
[1:12:06] midst amen the prophet come back
[1:12:09] hallelujah this day and said who do men
[1:12:11] say that i the son of man
[1:12:14] what was he saying to you
[1:12:16] hallelujah amen revelation 10 comes down
[1:12:20] we've got to under identify with these
[1:12:21] scriptures
[1:12:22] hallelujah verse 44.
[1:12:26] amen i'm going to break this portion
[1:12:28] and pharaoh said unto joseph i am
[1:12:31] pharaoh
[1:12:32] and without thee shall no man lift up
[1:12:35] his hand
[1:12:36] or his foot
[1:12:38] in all the land of egypt what authority
[1:12:42] what authority
[1:12:44] without you
[1:12:46] so i'm listening to the radio and i hear
[1:12:48] they're saying i'm talking about the
[1:12:49] wars and and the plagues and and all of
[1:12:52] this really and i ain't perturbed
[1:12:54] i ain't worrying about it
[1:12:56] because i've got a voice
[1:12:58] that's already spoke
[1:13:00] and i know my position
[1:13:02] is that right and i know all these
[1:13:04] things must come to pass
[1:13:06] and the bible but the end is not yet
[1:13:09] because it's waiting on the readiness of
[1:13:11] the bride for the bride to come into the
[1:13:14] unity of the fit
[1:13:16] is that right because as long as you're
[1:13:18] absent from the word then the rapture
[1:13:21] can't take place because he's waiting on
[1:13:22] you to get ready is that right
[1:13:25] hallelujah amen and so hallelujah the
[1:13:28] bible said his weight is on the unity of
[1:13:30] the feet no they're seeing him as son of
[1:13:32] god in the church they've got to come to
[1:13:34] that point where they identify the son
[1:13:36] of man that is here with us
[1:13:41] oh yes
[1:13:42] the bride will have thus saith the lord
[1:13:45] she will be an invincible army
[1:13:48] not even debt can harm her
[1:13:51] is that right
[1:13:52] she will be a super church a super race
[1:13:55] as she near the headstone
[1:13:57] she will be in the very own image
[1:14:01] hallelujah for the key of david
[1:14:03] hallelujah to place in order to unite
[1:14:06] her with him
[1:14:08] she's going to be united with him
[1:14:11] hallelujah
[1:14:12] she will be the pyramid city
[1:14:15] the heavenly jerusalem
[1:14:18] the lamb's wife
[1:14:19] hallelujah the city of the living god
[1:14:23] and i'll write my name in her forehead
[1:14:26] i'll show it in the sky hallelujah
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:32] and the famine is only going to tell you
[1:14:34] that you are to walk out in your
[1:14:36] authority
[1:14:38] hallelujah
[1:14:39] christ
[1:14:41] you see then then pharaoh began to give
[1:14:43] joseph a new name
[1:14:47] brother branham said when a name is
[1:14:48] changed
[1:14:50] victory won
[1:14:52] a victory won
[1:14:54] the victory's already won
[1:14:56] because the name of you know in the old
[1:14:58] testament he said i'll surname you
[1:15:01] that's what he told them
[1:15:02] a surname you
[1:15:04] he didn't change your first name he
[1:15:06] changed your last name
[1:15:07] you know he put you in the family
[1:15:10] and so you don't feel like an old cast
[1:15:13] you know you're a part of it
[1:15:15] if i make a mistake i'm still reading
[1:15:18] right and if i'm victorious i'm still
[1:15:20] reading
[1:15:21] and if i lie down and sleep i'm reading
[1:15:23] if i sit up and sleep i'm still reading
[1:15:24] you can't take that from me
[1:15:26] because my father's dna isn't sad hello
[1:15:30] somebody amen and i'll tell you what i'm
[1:15:32] shocked like him i look like him and
[1:15:34] when i speak i speak like him
[1:15:36] is that right even then people seem to
[1:15:38] say hey read
[1:15:39] amen and sometimes they're talking about
[1:15:41] me they're talking about my daddy about
[1:15:42] him and they see me in him
[1:15:45] and i've got a heavenly father
[1:15:48] who said i've sir named you hallelujah
[1:15:51] and so i've got his name
[1:15:53] and so fair enough you begin to verse 45
[1:15:56] he begin to change joseph's name
[1:15:59] and give him a name prince
[1:16:01] of the life of the age
[1:16:04] is that right eno becomes the life of
[1:16:08] what they're going through
[1:16:10] oh jesus amen hallelujah whatever
[1:16:13] happened
[1:16:14] you bride
[1:16:16] you're going to be the life
[1:16:17] of this age
[1:16:19] there's not going to be any life outside
[1:16:21] of you
[1:16:22] you're going to hold the key
[1:16:24] to unlock
[1:16:26] if there's going to be metamorphosis in
[1:16:28] this time by what we're seeing you're
[1:16:30] going to hold the key to all of that
[1:16:33] so you're going to start to accept who
[1:16:35] you are
[1:16:37] i totally believe we missed our
[1:16:39] authority in the word

[1:16:46] what we do in this economy recession we

[1:17:04] and i'll tell you one thing i've got two
[1:17:06] business degree and i wouldn't know what
[1:17:08] to do with the economy
[1:17:09] but by the holy ghost
