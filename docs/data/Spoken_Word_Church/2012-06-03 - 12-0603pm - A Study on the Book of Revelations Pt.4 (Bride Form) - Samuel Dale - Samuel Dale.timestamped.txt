[9:50] our hearts and lives in Jesus name
[9:54] amen seem like we have a up and down a
[9:57] little bit of the feed I don't know what
[9:59] it is Josh but I can tell a little bit
[10:01] up here maybe it's not back there but
[10:03] kind of going up and down some
[10:06] so all right
[10:10] Revelations 1 I was thinking you know
[10:13] I've preached on this many many times
[10:15] out of here but I hope it's never got to
[10:18] where that becomes uh you know tiring or
[10:21] whatever I don't know where it's that or
[10:23] where it's
[10:27] the sound like we get the
[10:31] off of it a little
[10:32] bit but we have spoke on this and we'll
[10:36] continue I guess to speak on it because
[10:37] I love it it's the bride's book Amen in
[10:40] the time you know in the doing so we
[10:42] just appreciate it amen Revelations 1
[10:45] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[10:47] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[10:49] things which must shortly come to pass
[10:52] and he sent and signified it by his
[10:54] Angel unto his servant John who by
[10:56] record of the word of God and of the
[10:58] testimony of Jesus Jesus Christ and of
[10:59] all things that he saw blessed is he
[11:02] that readeth and they that hear the
[11:04] words of this prophecy and keep those
[11:07] things which are written therein for the
[11:10] time is at hand you may be seated the
[11:14] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[11:16] the
[11:19] word
[11:21] now the time is at hand I just picked up
[11:24] a couple of these and didn't give them
[11:26] to put on the uh you know the internet
[11:29] but uh you know the time is at hand see
[11:32] it's this time that's where he's
[11:34] pointing to is this time it's it's right
[11:36] here all right in brother says in in the
[11:39] revelations book of symbols uh 1956 617
[11:44] paragraph 49 so the time is at
[11:48] hand said this book is to the Servants
[11:51] of God for the last time when the time
[11:54] is at hand when this book will be
[11:57] revealed the time is at hand when the
[12:00] book is to be revealed do you understand
[12:02] it that's where we're at now all right
[12:04] then he goes down to um paragraph that
[12:07] was paragraph 49 goes down to paragraph
[12:10] 78 of the same book and he says then the
[12:13] time is at hand and never a time since
[12:17] that day until this has the mystery of
[12:21] Jesus Christ ever been revealed until
[12:24] these last few years then which means
[12:28] that that time or shortly there after
[12:30] you know then the time is at hand right
[12:34] then page 16 of the church age book he
[12:37] said the time was not at hand
[12:41] previously the time was not at hand
[12:43] previously in the wisdom and economy of
[12:46] God this Mighty Revelation though fully
[12:49] known to God could not come forth hither
[12:53] to thus we immediately learn a principle
[12:55] the revelation of God for each age can
[12:58] come in that age age only and at a
[13:00] specific time all right he said this L
[13:03] age Lady of see the revelation of God
[13:06] will come in its due time it will not
[13:09] falter neither will it be premature
[13:11] think of this and heed it well for we
[13:13] are at the in time all right so the time
[13:17] is at hand the time to what the time to
[13:20] understand this is the day when it was
[13:23] to come forth and we was to understand
[13:26] and see the hour that we're living amen
[13:30] and I don't think that there could be
[13:32] anything any
[13:33] greater than for us to
[13:38] uh find out who we are right Amen to see
[13:41] who we are and what it is you know is in
[13:44] the understanding I just don't see how
[13:46] it could be any uh there's not anything
[13:50] could be any greater than to realize the
[13:54] Revelation you know of who we are and
[13:56] what we're doing here and and that way
[13:59] with Revelation then we will be able to
[14:02] withstand Satan and this is the most
[14:05] horrible age of all for Satan to try in
[14:08] every way and now he's using the
[14:12] message against you and I yes because we
[14:16] were talking last night about it in the
[14:19] the Bible study and different things I
[14:21] just don't understand when you can read
[14:24] something in the
[14:25] Bible brother the Ryan asked a question
[14:28] there at the end last night about how
[14:30] could these people kind of believe
[14:31] doctrines with that scripture that he
[14:34] gave you know that he that believe that
[14:36] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh see
[14:38] that's right here now that's got to be
[14:40] right present tense and how could they
[14:42] believe those doctrines with with that
[14:44] type of scripture and I said I don't
[14:46] understand it because that's the what I
[14:49] believe you know that when I can look at
[14:50] the scripture and I can see it that
[14:52] simple that I can read this like the
[14:54] Book of Revelation read it oh we say
[14:57] well what is the time at the hand what
[14:59] did that mean right there did that mean
[15:01] over here did that mean over there you
[15:03] know what it means the time when this
[15:06] book is being revealed right the time is
[15:09] at hand all right so then that's a
[15:11] simple simple thing of knowing and
[15:15] seeing to understand the hour that we're
[15:19] living now I gave you one this morning
[15:23] and I want to repeat that again to us as
[15:27] we begin to look it
[15:29] this because this book is the book now
[15:32] remember it's we gave you the quote
[15:34] where brother around said it's it's the
[15:36] revelation of Jesus Christ but it's not
[15:38] just the revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[15:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ in his
[15:43] bride amen down through the seven Church
[15:46] ages now that's the Book of Revelation
[15:49] so it's our book it's speaking
[15:51] personally yes to you and I if you want
[15:54] to read any book you would ask me
[15:55] Brother D what book in the Bible would
[15:57] be good to study on The Book of
[16:01] Revelation well now all of them symbols
[16:03] all we just listen to the prophet right
[16:07] and if you can't find it ask somebody
[16:09] and we'll try our best to help you to
[16:11] understand you know the uh the the the
[16:15] things of the where it's at or find it
[16:18] for you to see what brother brandham has
[16:20] said about these things and then see
[16:22] that would bring it to us all right now
[16:26] we ended up kind of speaking on the life
[16:28] say saying
[16:30] that he said in the book so go ahead and
[16:33] pull up number one brother of what we
[16:36] were using this
[16:38] morning that you know look what the
[16:41] prophet had to say he said it's like a
[16:43] voice of a trumpet say it unto me I am
[16:47] Alpha and Omega now we'll get to it in a
[16:50] minute the the Alpha and Omega ties into
[16:54] to where that we're at in today you know
[16:56] the end time all right the first thing I
[16:59] want to introduce it here I'm the the
[17:01] the I am the first and the light the
[17:04] first thing when the trumpet of God
[17:06] sounded I he turned and said I am Alpha
[17:09] and Omega I am from A to Z I'm all of it
[17:12] stand and listen to me as
[17:14] while now listen to that one amen it
[17:17] goes for the other one that I brought
[17:19] you know we'll get to it in a minute he
[17:23] said stand and listen to me a
[17:26] while all right now he's saying I'm the
[17:29] alpha and
[17:31] omega I'm the all of
[17:33] it I'm the complete Revelation now if
[17:37] you understand I'm the complete
[17:39] Revelation now stand and listen to me a
[17:42] while what brother around say that is
[17:45] being said to John on pmas see now who's
[17:47] this addressed
[17:49] to were addressed specifically were
[17:52] about back to the age now watch no to
[17:57] the church
[17:58] to the church it's not just to an age
[18:01] because an age can't receive anything
[18:04] and we know the message goes to the age
[18:06] the age of ly or the age of Philadelphia
[18:09] the age of Ephesus no but it's being
[18:12] specifically addressed to the Bride of
[18:16] Jesus Christ now nobody can understand
[18:20] the book unless they have the baptism of
[18:22] the Holy Ghost right all
[18:24] right now you can word out the words and
[18:27] express something to somebody you know
[18:29] was speaking and explain something by
[18:32] intellect that's right but if you don't
[18:36] have the Holy Ghost and the person
[18:38] you're talking to don't have the Holy
[18:39] Ghost one if one has the Holy Ghost
[18:42] other one don't one speaking in one
[18:43] language one the other one right that's
[18:45] right one is a natural language the
[18:47] other one is a Heavenly language so God
[18:51] says now listen you understand who I am
[18:54] now listen to me a while that's right
[18:57] stand still and listen go ahead pull the
[18:58] next one up
[19:00] brother CU there one I gave this morning
[19:03] and before I show you
[19:05] anything I want to let you
[19:08] know who I am
[19:11] right I am the Alpha and Omega he says
[19:15] the beginning and the ending right so
[19:18] now listen for a
[19:21] while listen to the words of
[19:25] authority because that's what he's
[19:27] expressing
[19:29] then he starts talking about
[19:32] who not addressed to even the age itself
[19:36] because the age gets a split message
[19:39] right the age gets to the false and to
[19:43] the TR it's a split message to the ages
[19:45] all right one to the true one to the
[19:47] false and coming down all right but this
[19:49] is not this is to the
[19:52] bride this is the bride's
[19:54] book this is the book of you and I
[19:57] telling about you and I yes some of you
[20:00] may like to read novels you know and and
[20:02] and do it I I read them this way I read
[20:05] few words the front and I turn to the
[20:08] back I read John and Mary and then at
[20:11] the end of it I read and they got
[20:12] married and rode off into the sunset you
[20:14] know well I done got the whole story you
[20:16] can go through all the rest of it you
[20:18] want to but I done got the whole story
[20:22] because I done found out who it was and
[20:23] find out what they doing you know all
[20:26] right but see God keeps unfolding his
[20:32] word and my whole point now is to try to
[20:35] get us to see one
[20:37] thing the Bible is revealing you and I
[20:41] amen right now these are helpful notes
[20:45] and points for later
[20:46] on cuz you see the the Believers in the
[20:51] book we we look at it like this kind of
[20:56] book and see that's what we're doing
[20:58] over in Revelations 5 when we talk about
[21:01] the seos and the taking the book and
[21:03] that we're like trying to look at a book
[21:05] like
[21:06] this you know some form that we can make
[21:11] and then say no no no it's not that it's
[21:14] Scrolls you know well we've been all
[21:16] through those things
[21:19] but I I thought the Bible was written
[21:23] about the people on Earth yes
[21:27] right
[21:29] you know
[21:31] what I thought it was written about Mo
[21:34] uh about Moses and his life while he was
[21:37] here
[21:38] amen it was written about Paul in his
[21:42] life while he was on earth right it was
[21:44] written about Jesus and his
[21:48] life well why can't we see that it's
[21:50] written about you and I Amen in our
[21:53] lives we are we'll get to it after a
[21:55] while we're we under our messenger will
[21:58] be the final voice to the final
[22:00] age well why can't we believe that
[22:04] right why can't we believe who we
[22:06] are well just just just you know it's
[22:10] just so hard cuz there's so many things
[22:12] that's going wrong see you're still
[22:15] hooked on if everything was going right
[22:17] so let me quote brother Rand uh I may
[22:20] Mis phrase it a high but it won't be
[22:22] much but he said the starry Skies you
[22:24] know and the great things that are
[22:25] happening are no sign of God's approval
[22:28] he said neither is the stormy thing a
[22:31] sign of his disapproval that's right he
[22:34] said his approval is in the elect
[22:37] amen right cuz that's his children
[22:40] that's
[22:41] right now no matter what you think about
[22:44] your
[22:45] family you know you still have a closer
[22:49] connection to your family than you do to
[22:51] anyone else right that's right I mean
[22:53] you may love other people and and all
[22:55] like that but still it's your family
[22:58] that's right well I believe that's the
[23:00] way God
[23:03] is it's just not a book written down
[23:05] that this is the act actually you know
[23:09] you could take this Bible and and put it
[23:12] into a movie yes and let the players act
[23:17] it out that's right
[23:20] you I mean you could see all of that you
[23:22] can see the I'd love to watch The Ten
[23:24] Commandments and you know and see what
[23:28] who is it Char and H they playing Moses
[23:30] yes and all and and I thought he done a
[23:32] good job in the the basis of portraying
[23:36] pretty close about what it would be like
[23:38] you know in a lot of respects you know
[23:40] and but still my point is the whole
[23:43] Bible could be put in movie form that's
[23:46] right to be able to be seen yes what
[23:49] would be our part of
[23:51] it we can look back and see other
[23:54] ages but why can't we see Who We Are
[23:57] that's right you know that they're
[24:00] waiting on us
[24:02] yes it's not us waiting on them that's
[24:05] right they're waiting on you and I to
[24:07] come to a place for a change to be able
[24:10] to take place amen go to Hebrews 11:40
[24:14] without us they cannot be made perfect
[24:16] like brother dick was saying the other
[24:17] day see now brother Bram died and went
[24:19] to the Grave so he's one of them waiting
[24:21] on us all right but so is brother Tatum
[24:23] sister Tatum you know Paul saying that
[24:28] then a few days later Paul had head
[24:30] chopped off you know what he was waiting
[24:32] on us yes well why can't we believe that
[24:35] church why can't we see who we are in
[24:38] the hour that we're living and see then
[24:41] the revelation of Jesus
[24:43] Christ is not now listen is not just a
[24:49] revelation of seeing Jesus Christ that's
[24:54] right that's the key that I'm trying to
[24:57] get us all to see amen we said well I
[25:00] see him he was there 2,000 years ago and
[25:02] there he was beautiful we've seen we got
[25:04] pictures of him and we we've got all of
[25:07] these things you know and
[25:11] uh that's well and
[25:15] good but where's Jesus
[25:18] Christ see it's not just talking about
[25:20] Jesus right that would go into a on
[25:24] that's form amen and if you stop only
[25:26] trying to reveal Jesus then you're one
[25:29] that's preaching that's right but I want
[25:32] to see Jesus
[25:35] Christ in that way then I'll be
[25:38] seeing myself right
[25:41] amen and learning who I am all right now
[25:45] so in the Book of Revelations he's never
[25:47] saw
[25:48] alone he's always in with the bride or
[25:52] in the
[25:54] bride and that way then we cannot we
[25:57] don't have to look at it to try to
[25:59] figure it out we just read the book
[26:01] that's right
[26:03] amen we just read the book let's go
[26:05] let's start just a little bit now and
[26:07] just read some turn in your Bibles I
[26:09] didn't give them this one to pull up but
[26:11] turn in your Bibles to
[26:13] Revelations we got down to about verse 8
[26:15] this morning let's go over to
[26:17] Revelations 1:9 and let's just read if
[26:21] they catch up with us we'll have it up
[26:23] there in a minute if they want to we'll
[26:25] go over to verse
[26:26] n and just read a little
[26:31] bit I John who Al who also am your
[26:35] brother and companion in Tribulation and
[26:38] in the kingdom and patience of Jesus
[26:40] Christ was in the aisle that is called
[26:42] patmas for the word of God and for the
[26:45] testimony of Jesus Christ all right now
[26:49] as I said that testimony of Jesus Christ
[26:52] is three times in the Book of
[26:55] Revelations the testimony of
[26:58] Jesus is another one that makes it four
[27:01] times that God is talking about and when
[27:05] he writes something to us multiple times
[27:09] it means to pay close attention to that
[27:12] point all right so there it is I'm your
[27:14] brother fellow companion by the
[27:16] testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the
[27:18] spirit on the Lord's day now watch this
[27:20] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[27:24] a
[27:25] trumpet now the voice was
[27:28] saying
[27:30] voice he didn't hear a
[27:33] voice introduce a voice
[27:37] right right right the voice was saying
[27:43] yes huh yes are you are you following me
[27:46] yes see what he heard was the voice
[27:50] right not a voice introducing a voice
[27:52] may be carnal but my point of
[27:55] illustration is why because look a voice
[27:59] saying the voice is saying I am Alpha
[28:02] and Omega the first and the last and
[28:06] what thou see us write in a book and
[28:07] send it unto the seven churches which
[28:10] are in Asia to Ephesians
[28:14] what the voice now is in red letter
[28:19] right so we were taught in in uh Baptist
[28:24] Bible
[28:25] school you know
[28:27] that if it was red letter it meant that
[28:30] was God speaking yes right yes I believe
[28:35] it's all God speaking but it emphasizes
[28:38] that it means the the voice of God is
[28:41] speaking to us all right and look look
[28:45] what he
[28:46] say now I love this
[28:50] scripture go watch what he said and I
[28:53] turned to see The
[28:56] Voice
[28:59] that spake with
[29:02] me and being
[29:05] turned I saw seven golden
[29:10] candlesticks he turned to see The
[29:18] Voice he knew the voice yes
[29:23] right this is John see John knew that
[29:27] voice amen it was not a strange voice
[29:31] that he heard that's
[29:35] right he knew that
[29:38] voice he said and I turned to see The
[29:45] Voice you know what he was expecting to
[29:48] see Jesus amen
[29:53] right now I call down there to
[29:58] you
[30:00] know marks them and if Donny answers the
[30:04] phone I know who that
[30:06] is if Mark answers the phone I know who
[30:09] that
[30:10] is you
[30:12] know why because I've heard that voice
[30:16] yes the voice then and the person is the
[30:20] same yes
[30:23] right it's hard for me to disguise my
[30:26] voice right
[30:27] but most of you have heard it so long
[30:29] until when I call you you know who it
[30:33] is without having to ask who is this you
[30:36] know that's right why because you've
[30:39] heard it yes but by hearing it you know
[30:43] who is speaking to you amen now get the
[30:46] point John knew who was
[30:52] speaking he was expecting to see Jesus
[30:55] when he turned yes right
[30:57] and that's what he saw
[31:00] Yes but he didn't see the physical Lord
[31:03] Jesus standing there that's
[31:06] right so I guess that was a surprise to
[31:11] me because if if you like I said if you
[31:14] were turned away and I say you know
[31:17] brother collie you just he knows who's
[31:20] there amen you
[31:24] know then if he turned around and saw
[31:26] brother Donnie
[31:27] or maybe Brother Gary he do a good job
[31:30] okay and where where's Timbo where's
[31:34] he Timbo can no not Timbo excuse me
[31:38] Tyler Tyler he can he can imitate the
[31:41] biggest Force
[31:44] n he can say went there this is my
[31:49] wife and he said other thing everybody
[31:52] knows who he's talking about or who he's
[31:55] imitating you know
[31:58] but it'd be surprised if he if you
[32:00] turned around and saw him when you know
[32:03] the
[32:04] voice
[32:08] personally that would make a surprise to
[32:11] you so I guess John was surprised when
[32:13] he
[32:15] turned now listen to what I'm
[32:19] saying I don't think John was expecting
[32:22] in any
[32:26] symbolics
[32:32] are you following me what it symbolics
[32:34] is yes when he turned to see The
[32:39] Voice he saw what
[32:44] now being turned i s seven golden
[32:50] candlesticks now he knows there's
[32:53] something about
[32:56] that
[32:57] because I mean you hear a voice of a man
[33:00] and you turn around and there's seven
[33:04] candlesticks and you know the voice came
[33:07] from
[33:11] there all right see then if that voice
[33:14] came from
[33:18] there he knew there was some problem
[33:23] now he he knows it's got to be broke
[33:25] down what that symbol is
[33:27] that's
[33:29] right right see because the symbol has
[33:31] to be interpreted
[33:34] right that's why people don't like the
[33:36] Book of Revelation see because it's in
[33:39] symbolics all right but see the prophet
[33:43] told us what the symbolics
[33:44] were now watch what he said
[33:47] no he saw seven
[33:52] candlesticks watch it we know that he
[33:55] saw and we can cover it we have over and
[33:58] over did he saw the candlesticks would
[34:01] be the church ages you know all right
[34:04] and it would be the messengers to the
[34:06] age right yes yes
[34:09] amen all right everybody understand
[34:11] that's what he knew that would be that
[34:12] what it would be he could understand
[34:14] that but here's what surprised him what
[34:17] and in the
[34:19] midst of the seven
[34:22] candlesticks one L un to the son of man
[34:25] mhm
[34:29] now he's not seeing
[34:34] Jesus yet he knew that was Jesus's voice
[34:38] that's
[34:39] right are you listening yes he knew the
[34:42] voice and he was expecting to see Jesus
[34:45] amen but he didn't see Jesus when he
[34:47] turned that's
[34:49] right the first he
[34:52] sees seven candlesticks when we get over
[34:55] to Revelation where you see
[34:57] that you'll see that Revelation 4 you
[35:01] know a little further where we're at and
[35:02] get over to four and start seeing the
[35:07] throne then he sees one on the throne
[35:10] then he seees people around the throne
[35:13] this unfailing like that we have the uh
[35:16] what you call it
[35:18] overlays you know I always like that in
[35:21] school because I always wondered who
[35:23] draw the body out but I love them things
[35:25] you know where overlays where
[35:27] that you can see a human body all right
[35:30] you know skin and all and you turned one
[35:34] over when you did they took the skin
[35:38] off yeah
[35:40] right then you turn another one over and
[35:44] there you can see the intestines and the
[35:45] heart and everything you know see it was
[35:48] unfolding what you're seeing that's
[35:51] right all right so that's what's taking
[35:52] place now the acts of a play that's
[35:55] right all right
[35:57] so he turns to see and he sees the seven
[35:59] scandles
[36:03] sticks maybe his understanding is that
[36:07] you
[36:08] know it's going to be the church ages
[36:11] and the things okay maybe God revealed
[36:13] that whether he did or not that's okay
[36:14] with me but I'm just saying that was
[36:16] probably what he was showing you but
[36:18] look now here he gets another opening
[36:21] and the Overlake opens up and here he
[36:23] said one La un the son of man notice it
[36:25] didn't say the son of man was standing
[36:28] there that's
[36:29] right it was one liken to the son of man
[36:32] that's
[36:34] right now one like the son of man to me
[36:43] is would be the son of man in another
[36:45] form
[36:48] right you know what we mean to change an
[36:50] imorph Fe
[36:52] yes you see the son of man in another
[36:55] form okay what form did he see him in
[36:59] see like unto the son of man clothed
[37:02] with a garment down to the
[37:06] foot he knows the symbolics and G about
[37:10] the PS with a golden
[37:13] girl
[37:16] now he didn't see a male image
[37:22] okay cuz you would not emphasize the P
[37:25] that's right amen
[37:28] he was seeing a female image okay right
[37:33] right heard about the PS I know it where
[37:36] it goes to because it was moved from the
[37:39] center part as a servant down to the
[37:41] times and ages of the the high priest
[37:44] and move up to the
[37:46] shoulders but it would still move to the
[37:49] PS this son of man was standing this one
[37:52] liking of the son of
[37:54] man would be in a female image
[37:59] so who is he
[38:04] seeing why it says one like the son of
[38:07] man don't say the son of man right see
[38:09] he's still in the point that it's got to
[38:12] be revealed to
[38:14] him no matter if a prophet sees
[38:17] something it's got to be revealed to the
[38:19] prophet what that is right all right so
[38:22] now let's get a couple of quotes and
[38:24] just listen to what's being said
[38:28] go ahead to number two on your notes
[38:34] brother and let's see what he's talking
[38:37] about this is uh patas Vision 60204 the
[38:42] even service paragraph
[38:44] 151 now it's the the King James version
[38:47] which you probably have either Scofield
[38:48] or maybe a Thompson Chain or some of
[38:51] them it isn't correct there cuz it says
[38:54] seven candlesticks the correct way is
[38:55] seven l stand right cuz a Candlestick
[38:58] see is it would it would burn out it's a
[39:03] lampstand coming up from the Old
[39:05] Testament you know U and it it's a
[39:08] lampstand cuz they kept pouring the oil
[39:10] in it wouldn't like a candle it just
[39:12] burned out and gone see that's what he's
[39:15] saying see it isn't correct there it
[39:18] does not say candlesticks it says lamp
[39:20] holders lamp stands I believe is the
[39:23] right correct word said in the original
[39:26] translation see in other words these
[39:29] seven golden candlesticks were seven
[39:31] churches all right it goes on describing
[39:34] it what it is being turned I saw one
[39:36] like the son of
[39:38] man standing in the midst of the the
[39:42] middle of the seven
[39:44] lampstands
[39:48] now I know the doctrine years ago and a
[39:51] lot of people had brought it of the
[39:53] Alpha and
[39:54] Omega and they'll say he was in the
[39:56] first church age and he'll be in the
[39:59] last Church age that's the Alpha and
[40:01] Omega but he said he was all the way up
[40:03] and down in between right now you
[40:07] describe that to me and I'd like for you
[40:09] to draw me a
[40:11] picture I'd like for you to draw me
[40:13] seven golden
[40:15] candlesticks and draw me whatever you
[40:18] want to put in the middle but put a
[40:19] feminist form standing in the
[40:24] midst now if it said six you could do it
[40:27] pretty easy that's right right you could
[40:30] just pull them apart that's right right
[40:32] that's right and draw it in the middle
[40:35] but how are you going to get it in
[40:40] 70 so there goes back to Hebrews 13 and8
[40:43] and what we've been talking about that
[40:45] it was the same holy ghost in every
[40:47] Church age that's right
[40:50] right all right the same holy ghost in
[40:52] every age that's right can put him in
[40:54] the midst of seven golden CLE that's
[40:56] right where it can be in each age now
[40:59] you can comprehend what's being said
[41:01] that's right now so then that's where
[41:04] he's put it at now look to the next
[41:07] one this is the patas vision same
[41:10] message paragraph
[41:12] 257 he's talking about and laid his
[41:15] right hand upon me saying to me fear not
[41:16] fire I am the first of life oh
[41:20] my not a
[41:22] prophet
[41:25] God that's not a prophet back there in
[41:31] Revelation
[41:33] 1 that's God Amen all right that's right
[41:39] God in
[41:41] what another form that's
[41:45] right
[41:47] true this is God you're looking
[41:49] at cuz he goes on down you know into the
[41:52] scripture of verse 16 15 16 sowh he fell
[41:56] at his
[41:58] feet not a Prophet this was
[42:02] God and let's get a little more picture
[42:04] of that go ahead with the number
[42:11] four John does not this is page 49
[42:14] Church book
[42:16] that John John does not say he turned to
[42:20] see the one whose voice he
[42:24] heard want you
[42:27] he turned to see the voice that's right
[42:31] amen oh I like that he turned to see the
[42:34] voice the voice and the person are
[42:38] one and the same Jesus is the word John
[42:43] one he turned to
[42:47] see John does not say he turned to see
[42:50] the one whose voice he heard
[42:54] right so by now see you'll see that he's
[42:57] catching on that when he turns when he
[43:00] first hears the
[43:02] voice he's thinking I'm going to see
[43:04] Jesus when I turn around right
[43:07] right but that's not the way that it
[43:10] done it see
[43:12] right so when he starts turning he
[43:15] realizes things are appearing that is
[43:17] not Jesus standing there in flesh
[43:22] right no the prophet said he didn't turn
[43:26] does not say he turned to see the one
[43:27] whose voice he heard that's
[43:32] right but he turned to see the voice
[43:35] that's right
[43:36] amen the voice in the
[43:39] person now he realizes what he's looking
[43:43] at he seven golden candlesticks left
[43:47] holders you
[43:51] know and he sees one like un to the son
[43:53] of man but he realizes that what he's
[43:56] looking
[43:58] at is almighty God Amen right the one he
[44:04] was expecting to begin with to see when
[44:06] he turns now it begins to unfold to him
[44:10] yes where Jesus is at that's right amen
[44:14] now remember at this time on
[44:17] patmas all right the Holy Ghost is
[44:19] already come with the death Pentecost
[44:23] yes and brought it into bride form right
[44:26] right look at the next one now just a
[44:28] few things to get it on your
[44:30] mind uh page
[44:32] 340 lady you see in church
[44:37] AG when the Methodist failed God raised
[44:40] up others and so it has gone on through
[44:44] the years until in this last age there
[44:47] is a again another people in the land
[44:52] people who under their
[44:54] messenger will be the final
[44:57] voice to the final age that's
[45:01] right under their messenger that's
[45:05] right uh we talking about it last night
[45:09] you know and somebody said well we need
[45:11] to go back and do it so higher
[45:15] higher you remember that last night
[45:17] somebody says do that so higher
[45:20] high okay you you know okay so you
[45:25] understand
[45:27] I I'm glad of one
[45:30] thing y'all know I'm crazy but I'm glad
[45:33] of one thing science says that you can
[45:35] put a tape on and listen to it and learn
[45:37] a language while you're
[45:41] sleep I'm glad of
[45:46] that I just wonder how much you can
[45:48] learn but I'm still proud of the fact
[45:51] that that science says it can be done
[45:53] okay all that gives me Comfort you know
[45:56] all right but see under her messenger
[45:58] she will be the final voice yes
[46:02] right but whatever voice was protruding
[46:05] protruding out of the
[46:09] candlesticks was the voice of almighty
[46:12] God Amen all right that's right but he
[46:16] was in another form
[46:19] yes that's the title of this you know
[46:22] put a little second title to everybody
[46:24] the title is what bride
[46:28] form under her messenger she's the final
[46:30] voice to the final age that's right
[46:33] she's the bride form there's not going
[46:34] to be another Voice come
[46:37] down to condemn this age that's right it
[46:40] has done been
[46:43] condemned and under her messenger she
[46:45] will be the final
[46:47] voice to the final age all right and who
[46:51] is that then let's go on to the next
[46:54] one seven Church ages 54
[46:59] 512 what one like him so he reading the
[47:02] scripture in the midst of the seven
[47:03] golden cand one like him the son of man
[47:06] look what one like
[47:10] him now he's expressing what I said this
[47:13] is not him standing there in person
[47:16] physically seeing him that's right
[47:19] right one like him that's right now
[47:23] watch what he who was this
[47:27] and he answers it it's the
[47:34] bride that don't need interpreting does
[47:36] it no he just answered he asked the
[47:39] question in other words who is this if
[47:42] one like the son of man he said it's a
[47:43] bride one like him what how it was clo
[47:47] with the Garment down the foot the
[47:49] Holiness of Jesus Christ covering
[47:51] her has washed us from our sins with his
[47:54] own blood all right G about the pouch
[47:57] not a
[47:58] man a
[48:01] woman all right the bride of
[48:05] Christ is what he
[48:08] saw all
[48:09] right now watch what I'm
[48:13] say he saw the
[48:15] candlesticks
[48:16] yes he could have got the
[48:20] symbolics and seen the church ages right
[48:23] right amen God could have open to him
[48:26] what that was that's right that that was
[48:28] the church ages that was coming down
[48:31] amen all right that's right now but that
[48:34] wasn't all he showed him that's
[48:37] right he showed him one in the midst of
[48:39] the seven golden C like another son of
[48:41] man he showed him the bride
[48:46] amen the Bride of Jesus Christ all right
[48:50] now just a couple more and we'll get
[48:52] back to preaching a
[48:54] little look at just the next one uh page
[48:57] 52 patas
[49:03] Vision which is church age book there he
[49:07] stands one like unto the son of
[49:10] man now what's the description of this
[49:12] son of
[49:13] man as the jewel is beautified by the
[49:17] mounting of the
[49:20] ring so he is
[49:24] glorified in the midst of the
[49:29] churches it is the Lord's day for John
[49:32] sees him standing not as a priest but as
[49:35] the coming judge a golden girdle is no
[49:37] longer gir around the waist where the
[49:40] priest must wear as he ministers to God
[49:43] in the holiest place but is now around
[49:46] his shoulders or for he is not now the
[49:50] priest but the
[49:52] judge all right now
[49:56] I thought we believed that we would
[49:58] judge
[50:01] Angels that's right right
[50:05] right right see then the same one you're
[50:08] looking at is one day going to be
[50:10] sitting on the
[50:13] throne that's right judging
[50:16] angels and if it shows now
[50:19] listen if it's showing him in his judge
[50:23] form and we will be sitting on the
[50:25] throne with him so you go over to Daniel
[50:29] we can get into that Revelations get to
[50:32] White
[50:33] throne and see that there's one sitting
[50:36] on the white throne and then there's
[50:38] many sitting with that one amen that's
[50:41] right which is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[50:42] to judge the world that's right all
[50:44] right
[50:45] now then at the time of
[50:49] judgment to those that are sitting on
[50:51] the
[50:53] throne judgment is
[50:57] complete you agree right I mean come on
[51:01] now we know they can do it today you
[51:02] know because of crooked judges but
[51:05] really the judge is supposed to be the
[51:07] final
[51:08] Authority not necessarily today but
[51:11] still he's supposed to be the final
[51:14] Authority amen that's
[51:16] right especially if you go to the
[51:18] Supreme
[51:19] Court and get to the justice and all
[51:22] they're supposed to be the final
[51:23] Authority all right so you understand
[51:25] what I'm saying yes before he shows the
[51:28] church ages and what we are he's already
[51:31] took us in the symbolics yes and brought
[51:35] us even to the white Throne judgment yes
[51:38] the where that we sit on the Judgment
[51:39] with him amen judging everybody else
[51:42] that's right right amen now if that's
[51:47] true how can we
[51:52] F
[51:54] right
[51:56] you know the only way you can
[51:58] fail is to be a failure yourself I don't
[52:01] know where that's the right way to say
[52:02] it but we're the only ones that can mess
[52:04] this up that's right
[52:06] right but if he seen us we're going to
[52:09] be there am amen that's
[52:12] right now if not he have to rewrite the
[52:14] book that's right that's
[52:17] right but he's not going to do it okay
[52:19] one
[52:24] more this is why we're not a
[52:26] denomination 1958
[52:30] 927 paragraph 180 now if you notice in
[52:34] Revelations 1 we find Jesus standing in
[52:37] seven Church ages in the seven Church AG
[52:42] seven golden candlesticks when he turned
[52:44] and saw one like another son of man
[52:47] standing clothed with a how it was it
[52:51] was a bride standing in the candlesticks
[52:55] draw
[52:56] out amen all right now there's two or
[52:59] three times that he tells us who this is
[53:02] in
[53:03] Revelations
[53:06] one John finally falls down to reading
[53:10] on down in the scriptures he falls down
[53:13] to worship this one that's right and he
[53:17] said see you don't do
[53:18] it and the red letter says I'm the alpha
[53:21] and omega amen I'm the beginning and the
[53:24] end yes but where's he speaking
[53:29] from that's the the key right
[53:33] yes he's speaking from you and I that's
[53:36] right
[53:37] right we're going to be the final voice
[53:40] of this final
[53:43] age there won't be no court of appeal if
[53:46] people turn us down that's
[53:49] right we're not trying to scare nobody
[53:52] that's right it won't work that's right
[53:59] you we were talking this morning about
[54:02] it that there's actually people and that
[54:04] wouldn't want the wording but you know
[54:06] there's actually people there my wife
[54:08] and I coming up the road you know that
[54:10] you
[54:11] can't you can't correct that's
[54:16] amen and brother R says you can't tell
[54:19] that woman that it's wrong for her to
[54:22] wear her shorts and cut her high and
[54:24] time
[54:25] now
[54:27] why and remember that said anointed once
[54:29] in time right or is that no it
[54:34] not it's because she's Anointed with the
[54:37] Holy
[54:43] Spirit
[54:46] right how can you tell these preachers
[54:48] about the land in the message out of the
[54:50] message or whoever that they're wrong
[54:52] about their
[54:53] Doctrine when they are
[54:55] Anointed with even the genuine Holy
[54:58] Spirit that's
[55:01] true is that the prophet's
[55:05] message but now the on that he
[55:09] sees remember there's two
[55:13] churches there's a bride yes
[55:17] right the bride is not just an anointed
[55:20] one that's right sure she has the
[55:23] anointing and that's what she is she is
[55:25] the anointed I mean the anointing so
[55:28] when you go over to Daniel and pick it
[55:30] up and I mean over to Daniel 70 week and
[55:33] pick it up brother around and say we
[55:35] ride back in the Millennium as the
[55:37] anointing to the
[55:39] Temple of
[55:42] people that's our personal church I'm
[55:44] trying to make
[55:46] it but now get what I'm saying the
[55:49] church I'm trying to divide church and
[55:51] bride okay right Milwaukee is on to me
[55:54] all time about when I use the word
[55:57] church but I'm using what brother R
[56:01] says because she likes me to use the
[56:03] word bride which is good you know the
[56:07] bride cuz there's a difference the bride
[56:09] and the
[56:11] church but you know what they're sitting
[56:13] right there together in the church right
[56:15] there together in the age that we're
[56:17] here each age had wise and foolish
[56:19] virgin he said AG had false Vine and
[56:22] True Vine right the bride down Through
[56:26] the Ages is what John is seeing on patas
[56:30] yes he's not seeing the church right
[56:34] right he's not seeing the anointed ones
[56:37] right even though the anointing is a
[56:40] genuine Holy Spirit that's right
[56:42] right dwelling on man's
[56:46] spirit and makes him religious when to
[56:49] go to church signs and wonders taking
[56:53] place but that's not his bride that's
[56:57] right his bride is shown in the midst of
[56:59] the seven golden kind that's right right
[57:02] the church is not shown there that's
[57:05] right the church comes up later in
[57:08] the writing in the
[57:11] book now you might not like this one
[57:14] either but I won't spend much time on
[57:16] the church ages because I don't feel
[57:18] it's necessary to govern each age but I
[57:21] will make this
[57:22] statement when you look in the church
[57:25] age we know that he was speaking to two
[57:29] Vines mhm right yes all right you know
[57:34] looking at that false
[57:37] Vine she's the
[57:42] church she's the anointed one yes right
[57:47] she claims to be the people of God
[57:50] yes and God speaks to her just as well
[57:53] as he speaks to the bride that's
[57:56] right and you read Revelations 2 and 3
[57:59] because we won't try to cover those
[58:00] we'll go to the Lord willingness coming
[58:02] Wednesday nothing don't come up we'll go
[58:04] over to Revelations 4 so read that cuz
[58:06] I'm not going to spend much time in the
[58:08] church ages because my emphasis today is
[58:11] the point that's right in the church
[58:14] ages you know that what we
[58:16] do let's get a little bit of little bit
[58:19] back there off of some of the other
[58:21] message brother rman invisible Union
[58:24] said you're
[58:26] your name is transferred okay remember
[58:28] that yes right and brother Gary do you
[58:33] realize when the church ages when we
[58:34] started out we was a
[58:39] church come
[58:42] on but when we got born again we become
[58:44] the bride that's
[58:46] right you
[58:49] agree but you started out it's a church
[58:52] that's right under justification
[58:55] and
[58:57] sanctification before you receive the
[58:59] new birth you are a church that's
[59:03] right that's
[59:05] good just like all the other
[59:09] churches that's why Brother D you don't
[59:11] hear me throw off on them people
[59:13] right why because we everyone got our
[59:17] start there that's right amen whether
[59:20] you like it or not whether you ever went
[59:23] to a denominational Church
[59:25] justification and sanctification has to
[59:29] clean out that old thing that's right
[59:31] amen right so read the church
[59:35] ages and you'll see that he's speaking
[59:37] brother says to two
[59:40] Vines but just
[59:43] remember you and I used to be of the
[59:45] wrong Vine that's right right you can
[59:49] believe all you want to about all these
[59:50] seed doctrines and all these things but
[59:54] you still started out lost that's right
[59:58] amen Right started life lost right amen
[1:00:03] but God saw that God put a seat in me
[1:00:07] where was it and what was
[1:00:09] it that's all I've ever asked anybody
[1:00:12] what it's a word well okay Paul said the
[1:00:16] letter
[1:00:20] kth the word that's in an individual
[1:00:23] will destroy you and I
[1:00:25] if it's not Quicken and made alive
[1:00:27] that's right amen all right so we
[1:00:30] started in the ages so don't feel so bad
[1:00:33] you know don't look at it wrong oh that
[1:00:36] old false
[1:00:38] Vine that's way people are today you
[1:00:40] know that old denomination out there
[1:00:43] them old M this Badness and them more
[1:00:47] Pentecostals just
[1:00:51] remember whether you agree with it or
[1:00:53] not you better listen to it
[1:00:55] amen we started out lost that's right
[1:00:58] and being lost we was the church amen a
[1:01:01] religious Society that's
[1:01:05] right but the new birth makes you the
[1:01:08] bride of Christ amen right and when you
[1:01:11] get the new
[1:01:13] birth you're going to come out of the
[1:01:15] church that's right that's right so then
[1:01:18] you name is transferred
[1:01:21] amen from churchy to bride that's right
[1:01:24] praise the Lord all
[1:01:26] right that's why I don't choose to go
[1:01:29] through the ages I don't think it's
[1:01:31] necessary to just take the ages and
[1:01:33] express what they are we should know
[1:01:35] that if you don't go get your church age
[1:01:37] book and read it that's right I'm
[1:01:40] dealing with the symbolics of the things
[1:01:42] that the prophet is expressing to us to
[1:01:44] show us what this is yes because to me
[1:01:48] now
[1:01:50] listen this Revelations chap 1
[1:01:55] goes
[1:01:56] from Genesis to Revelation
[1:02:00] okay it picks you and I up as what we
[1:02:03] was yes and brings us to what we are
[1:02:08] amen it shows our start as the church
[1:02:12] amen a religious Society yes amen I say
[1:02:16] that with words in a religious
[1:02:19] society and then it shows us transferred
[1:02:24] amen
[1:02:24] to show us as the bride of Christ and
[1:02:28] before he started chapter
[1:02:31] 2 which would start the church
[1:02:34] ages read chapter one
[1:02:39] over and then you'll see that no matter
[1:02:41] what it says we are and we realize we
[1:02:44] done that we was
[1:02:48] that God already said was perfect
[1:02:53] amen God already showed us at the
[1:02:56] sitting on the white throne with us
[1:02:58] because G about the PCH with the golden
[1:03:00] girl that's going to from the waist to
[1:03:04] to Servant to to Ministry to the to to
[1:03:07] the shoulders and I thought we believe
[1:03:09] that we were the
[1:03:11] shoulders I thought we believe Isaiah
[1:03:13] said what upon his
[1:03:17] shoulders
[1:03:19] amen and you know his so shoulders is
[1:03:21] the bride cuz that's where you carry the
[1:03:23] weight from you know
[1:03:24] that's the bride of Christ amen Lord so
[1:03:28] we're looking at oursel as God sees it
[1:03:30] and what was that one that brother BR
[1:03:32] gave that a diamond so beautiful and all
[1:03:34] of this that and the other and he says
[1:03:38] that's what we
[1:03:42] are and I said it like I did this
[1:03:44] morning no matter how bad your children
[1:03:48] are you don't look back down at them and
[1:03:51] every time they come in the house don't
[1:03:54] don't come in my house like
[1:03:56] that now there's people that have done
[1:03:59] those things and that's that's true it's
[1:04:01] your life to live not
[1:04:03] mine my kids are welcomed in my home no
[1:04:06] matter what they ever
[1:04:08] do now I want agree with what they're
[1:04:10] doing and I let them know in a hurry I
[1:04:12] don't agree what they're
[1:04:14] doing and there's certain things I tell
[1:04:16] them don't bring in here right but
[1:04:19] they're welcome to come
[1:04:21] right because they're my children
[1:04:26] and I count my daughter-in-laws as to be
[1:04:28] my children count my son-in-laws to be
[1:04:31] my son he number
[1:04:34] three you know he number three
[1:04:40] son some of you come along you going to
[1:04:42] have to be number three number four I
[1:04:44] mean number four number five and all
[1:04:46] like that and Rachel she's number you
[1:04:49] know she's daughter number
[1:04:51] two she's got to fit in there because
[1:04:53] she's adopted
[1:04:55] we old our
[1:04:57] she but you see
[1:05:00] church I'm trying to get us to see what
[1:05:02] God says about us and for us to quit
[1:05:06] saying what the world says about us I
[1:05:09] know I'm a sinner I admit
[1:05:12] it saved by the grace of
[1:05:23] God see then that's why I can't look
[1:05:25] down on nobody
[1:05:29] else I don't agree with people but still
[1:05:31] that's human
[1:05:34] beings do some of the most horrible
[1:05:36] things that could ever be thought of
[1:05:37] even a good Baptist would never do
[1:05:39] things like they do in this message and
[1:05:42] I say that cuz it's where I come from
[1:05:43] the
[1:05:44] Baptist but I remember in the Baptist
[1:05:46] when they wouldn't let a devil married
[1:05:47] preacher preach the Baptist church and
[1:05:51] I'm just 72 years old so that means it's
[1:05:53] still had to be in the
[1:05:55] 50s and up into the
[1:05:58] 60s before they started
[1:06:02] changing I haveen sit on the Deacon
[1:06:05] board and the deacons in the Baptist
[1:06:08] Church is the one that calls the
[1:06:10] preacher right they go visit him they
[1:06:12] have a preachers committee but it's
[1:06:14] always made up of the
[1:06:16] deacons and they go visit the preacher
[1:06:19] that was question number
[1:06:21] one how many times you you been
[1:06:28] married we did believe a few
[1:06:33] times but you see now it's just what
[1:06:35] does it make any difference we're under
[1:06:37] grace don't make it
[1:06:39] disgrace
[1:06:41] right make it the truth of God Amen and
[1:06:45] walk there in all right are you
[1:06:47] listening I ain't Turn the Page
[1:06:49] yet but now
[1:06:51] listen see it was not a prophet
[1:06:55] brother emphasized that was shown there
[1:06:59] so it wouldn't have been brother Bram
[1:07:00] standing in the seven golden
[1:07:05] Candlestick
[1:07:06] see now listen to what I'm saying
[1:07:09] because this is what I believe when you
[1:07:12] see the bride of Christ brother brandom
[1:07:15] is part of the bride of Christ so you
[1:07:17] get the emphasis of what I'm making he
[1:07:20] didn't turn and see brother Brandon
[1:07:21] standing there he turned and saw the
[1:07:23] bride you know what that put brother
[1:07:25] Brandon standing there do you understand
[1:07:27] that language cuz he's part of the body
[1:07:30] of
[1:07:31] Christ so when you're dealing with the
[1:07:33] body of Christ he was part of the body
[1:07:35] of
[1:07:37] Christ so when he turns to see The
[1:07:43] Voice first off he's expecting to see
[1:07:46] Jesus but when he realizes that he he's
[1:07:49] not seeing him he begins to see the
[1:07:52] symbolics
[1:07:54] and it symbolics his opening up to see
[1:07:56] the the bride of Christ and then he
[1:07:59] sees one like under the son of man
[1:08:03] brother randam was not the son of
[1:08:06] man that's the first message I preached
[1:08:09] 1969 in Athens
[1:08:13] Georgia that was that the first message
[1:08:15] I preached in a church i t Sunday school
[1:08:18] and thing but the first message I
[1:08:21] preached that brother random was not
[1:08:24] the son of man I still got the notes
[1:08:27] written in the front of my Bible always
[1:08:28] transfer them this for the purpose
[1:08:31] because it was part of what I had back
[1:08:34] there brother around was telling us who
[1:08:36] the son of man
[1:08:38] is the son of man is the
[1:08:42] word that's why Jesus was called the son
[1:08:44] of man he was the word made flesh right
[1:08:48] now what we look at see and naturally it
[1:08:51] came down to the ages yes
[1:08:55] but when God is looking at the seven
[1:08:57] golden candlesticks he's not seeing the
[1:09:01] church ages now you going to think I'm
[1:09:04] totally turned around but listen he's
[1:09:06] not seeing the church ages as described
[1:09:09] in chapter two and
[1:09:13] three I give a minute plunder that one
[1:09:18] because he's not seeing the
[1:09:22] wrong
[1:09:24] you listening to me when John turns to
[1:09:26] see he sees what God sees and he sees
[1:09:29] the bride
[1:09:31] right he don't see the wrong that's
[1:09:33] right or else how could you even speak a
[1:09:36] son of man okay see you wouldn't even
[1:09:38] speak a son of Cu there is no I
[1:09:41] challenge you come and show me there's
[1:09:43] nobody in the Bible Paul and them didn't
[1:09:46] use the phrase son of man mhm it was not
[1:09:49] for them to be used that's
[1:09:52] right Matthew Mark Luke and John used
[1:09:55] the phrase because that was what Jesus
[1:09:57] was
[1:10:00] amen but Paul and them never mentioned
[1:10:02] son of man that's right but when brother
[1:10:05] Brandon starts out in 47 or something he
[1:10:10] starts out talking about the son of
[1:10:14] man but he was not that the son of man
[1:10:16] he was a son of man that God was
[1:10:20] using he said if he don't come I can't
[1:10:23] do nothing I'm waiting on
[1:10:27] him he said and even there's a tape
[1:10:30] there where that I'm just using his
[1:10:34] voice right
[1:10:37] right how close would it get to seeing
[1:10:40] him but yet he wasn't de son of
[1:10:47] man but when he goes here to patmas he
[1:10:50] sees one liken to the son of man right
[1:10:56] and I believe he
[1:10:58] saw Paul Iranians Columbo Martin Luther
[1:11:02] Wesley Pentecost in this
[1:11:06] day right right he saw this day now he
[1:11:12] didn't just see this
[1:11:14] day are you following me he saw the
[1:11:17] bride down Through the Ages all the way
[1:11:20] through CU she's always been him amen
[1:11:25] he
[1:11:28] is the son of
[1:11:30] man he said well wait just a minute now
[1:11:33] you made hurt greater than brother
[1:11:34] brandham no brother brandham in the body
[1:11:36] now you you lost that one CU I made that
[1:11:40] emphasis before I made the
[1:11:42] statement brother Brandon being part of
[1:11:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ can be
[1:11:48] revealed in the Book of Revelation as
[1:11:50] one lik un to the son of
[1:11:52] man
[1:11:54] cuz he's in the body of Christ the body
[1:11:57] of Christ is no different from the
[1:11:58] Christ that's
[1:12:01] right are you following me yes so when
[1:12:04] John sees what he sees you know what he
[1:12:06] sees now listen so you don't think oh he
[1:12:08] crossly said he sees
[1:12:14] Jesus no I done been through he didn't
[1:12:16] see him standing there in
[1:12:19] flesh but he sees Jesus who is almighty
[1:12:22] God
[1:12:24] right and he's in Bride
[1:12:28] form so he sees you and I but he sees
[1:12:32] all the bride of Christ down through
[1:12:33] Seven Ages yes but if we had to come
[1:12:36] forth in the end time if we don't come
[1:12:38] forth into this word then the son of man
[1:12:40] can't be brought back again like it
[1:12:43] was oh but brother Brown that was a
[1:12:46] Ministry yes
[1:12:50] right someone had to introduce to on of
[1:12:53] man right and that's what he was doing
[1:12:57] am one time brother R said it like that
[1:13:00] he said that he'd be pointing to the sky
[1:13:03] at a word born
[1:13:07] bride the messenger of this age will be
[1:13:09] pointing to the skies amen see the word
[1:13:13] born bride thank you Jesus now notice
[1:13:17] here he shows how perfect we are and
[1:13:20] writes
[1:13:22] it
[1:13:24] before we ever even started the
[1:13:27] journey a that a beautiful book amen
[1:13:30] that's right I mean you want to John and
[1:13:31] Mary live happily ever
[1:13:35] after my
[1:13:38] Lord to show us already there and shows
[1:13:43] us even up as far as the white Throne
[1:13:45] judgment sitting there with the
[1:13:47] government Upon Our
[1:13:52] shoulders
[1:13:55] sitting on the throne with
[1:14:00] him now hold on to this one so
[1:14:03] swaller then he could get down and walk
[1:14:10] away there wouldn't be no empty
[1:14:15] Gap you get
[1:14:18] it he could get down and walk away and
[1:14:21] reveal himself to somebody else
[1:14:23] he wanted
[1:14:25] to because when we go to the marriage
[1:14:29] supper you
[1:14:34] know he's going to be there for a
[1:14:37] while I'm going have to quote scripture
[1:14:39] brother Rand R said he'd come down
[1:14:41] through there we'd be sitting at that
[1:14:45] table and he said he'd wipe away the
[1:14:48] tears from her eyes that's s marage
[1:14:52] supper said say Well done th good and
[1:14:54] faithful service enter into the joys of
[1:14:56] the
[1:14:59] Lord but you know what our husband does
[1:15:03] then before we go on the
[1:15:10] honeymoon now come on I hope you're
[1:15:12] thinking spiritual and not carnality
[1:15:15] that's
[1:15:17] right he will be in our midst to wipe
[1:15:19] away the tears from our eyes we will see
[1:15:22] him he will serve us communion right
[1:15:26] right you know what he does he just
[1:15:28] simply steps
[1:15:30] aside now what are we going to be
[1:15:35] doing where'd he go where'd he go
[1:15:39] no maybe we might be having a good old
[1:15:41] fashion meeting you
[1:15:44] know and he just steps away and brother
[1:15:47] brother says and goes and reveals itself
[1:15:50] to the
[1:15:52] Jews
[1:15:54] now that's not the Corporal body so
[1:15:57] maybe he can stand in the middle of it
[1:16:00] and still be down there talking to the
[1:16:02] Jews at the same time okay but you skip
[1:16:05] my
[1:16:09] point if he stepped out from our midst
[1:16:11] it wouldn't leave a vacuum that's
[1:16:14] right because if you see him you see us
[1:16:18] amen you
[1:16:20] know you see the bride you see Christ
[1:16:23] amen but said when you begin to see the
[1:16:26] word you're seeing Jesus
[1:16:30] amen think on these
[1:16:33] things bride
[1:16:38] form then he's not left without a form
[1:16:41] that's right now you want to go back
[1:16:44] through and all of the things of the
[1:16:45] voice of the many things I looked at
[1:16:47] this week and thought well that's all
[1:16:49] right I won't try to bring it when
[1:16:50] brother Brandon was talking about the
[1:16:51] voice he said
[1:16:53] it's the voice of many
[1:16:56] ministers carrying the message to the
[1:17:02] world what God showed John was the bride
[1:17:06] living upon Earth not just sitting on a
[1:17:09] white throne but living reality of on
[1:17:12] Earth and what we're doing and the age
[1:17:14] that we're living in right showing us
[1:17:17] how perfect he sees us to be that's
[1:17:19] right that there's no flaws you said
[1:17:22] what I just got some many problem well
[1:17:24] okay let's see if you believe the
[1:17:27] scripture there was a man one time got
[1:17:29] hired you know pay a price to curse
[1:17:34] Israel you remember B old ba paid him to
[1:17:38] go down and curse
[1:17:40] Israel
[1:17:42] well he goes down
[1:17:45] there and he shows God theer
[1:17:49] parts now that's the words that use
[1:17:51] there but you going to have interpret
[1:17:55] that you
[1:17:57] know where the hinder Parts the worst
[1:17:59] Parts you can see
[1:18:03] right and what does God
[1:18:06] say that bam is calling God there look
[1:18:09] at what they're doing you see what
[1:18:12] they're doing down there they're making
[1:18:14] golden C they're dancing around them
[1:18:16] they all in this that is doing like
[1:18:17] everything in the world do you see all
[1:18:20] that he said I can't see him
[1:18:23] mhm he just sitting there
[1:18:26] grinning he said I can't see
[1:18:29] him I B said now you know you can you're
[1:18:32] omnicient let you know it he said but
[1:18:36] you don't see what I
[1:18:38] see brother said he could tell bam you
[1:18:42] don't hear the shout of the king in the
[1:18:46] camp bam heard the shou and dancing
[1:18:49] around the
[1:18:50] idols but there was a king in theing
[1:18:55] camp and he couldn't show him
[1:18:58] that you know what I love to put with
[1:19:01] that it was really great to understand
[1:19:04] it brother Brown said if somebody
[1:19:07] repents of their sins he said even with
[1:19:09] the gift I
[1:19:11] have I'm paraphrasing it he said I can't
[1:19:15] call that
[1:19:19] out ain't that
[1:19:21] something why because it's gone yes
[1:19:24] right it's in to see if it's
[1:19:26] forgetfulness
[1:19:28] right so then all that we're doing and
[1:19:30] all of the problems we've got today is
[1:19:32] in the sea of his
[1:19:34] forgetfulness but you mean that would
[1:19:36] make you think well I can just get by
[1:19:37] with anything well I just go on and do
[1:19:40] this or do that cuz I can get by with it
[1:19:43] you're not even born again when you
[1:19:45] think like that that's right I A A good
[1:19:48] anointed
[1:19:51] one
[1:19:53] why has it been lost the Christian Life
[1:19:56] Of The B message
[1:20:00] Believers you know what I mean to
[1:20:02] Christian Life right do you know that
[1:20:05] people used to be so honest and do
[1:20:08] it and de brother been about man that

[1:20:16] house well he was gone farming he was
[1:20:18] gone working you had a little story
[1:20:21] there you just went in the store

[1:20:45] nothing laying around you know they
[1:20:47] going to get in and steal everything

[1:20:57] home uper gu for it my brother offered
[1:21:00] me $5,000 profit before I even in $5,000

[1:21:14] paperwork with my brother that or my
[1:21:16] nephew that I sold it to I not signed
[1:21:19] any paperwork I just give him a word

[1:21:31] you take half of it and we'll let him H
[1:21:32] the
[1:21:34] place I said no Terry can't do
[1:21:37] it I said my word ain't worth $5,000 it
[1:21:40] ain't worth
[1:21:42] nothing
[1:21:44] right you got my
[1:21:48] word see that's where I want to be how
[1:21:50] much more does God want us to believe
[1:21:52] his word right
[1:21:54] think on these things what form is God
[1:21:56] in today from Calvary he went up you
[1:22:00] know went down up paid the price come
[1:22:03] back on the de P he's been in Bride form
[1:22:06] now for 2,000
[1:22:08] years that bride form is the one I'm
[1:22:11] talking about that's standing there on
[1:22:13] patas Martin Luther was there just as
[1:22:16] well as anybody else and the son of man
[1:22:18] wouldn't even spoke of in his ages but
[1:22:20] he's part of the word
[1:22:26] see because he was only seeing the bride
[1:22:29] he was seeing the church she's busy
[1:22:31] somewhere
[1:22:33] else he was seeing the
[1:22:36] bride the form of
[1:22:39] God the imorph where he changes his form
[1:22:43] to live in you and I and you know what
[1:22:46] people do with you and I is how they're
[1:22:47] treating
[1:22:49] God that's not a fear you don't hear me
[1:22:52] going out bless God you better be
[1:22:53] careful what you say about me that's
[1:22:56] right no but it's like I've always said
[1:22:58] if I sin you got a right to go tell the
[1:23:01] world I've done
[1:23:03] wrong you watch the preacher this
[1:23:05] message you ain't going to tell it to
[1:23:06] you that way that's right you better
[1:23:09] watch that you're touching God's
[1:23:10] anointing if I go out and commit
[1:23:12] adultery and you put it in the Atlanta
[1:23:16] Constitution and the journal morning
[1:23:18] evening both I guess we still
[1:23:21] going and you put it in the paper and
[1:23:23] send it around the world you know you're
[1:23:26] not going to get in trouble with
[1:23:28] God because I done it that's right I'm
[1:23:31] the one that's in trouble that's right
[1:23:33] but if I didn't do it okay and you go
[1:23:37] tell it that's
[1:23:39] right you're in trouble with God that's
[1:23:42] right there is where you touch not my
[1:23:45] anointed and do my profits no harm the
[1:23:49] little bride of Christ I hope you
[1:23:51] understand what I'm trying to drive the
[1:23:52] Lord willing Wednesday we'll pick up and
[1:23:54] try to get into Revelations 4 cuz I
[1:23:56] don't want to get into the church ages I
[1:23:57] don't think it's necessary to cover each
[1:23:59] age I think I've made I'll review just a
[1:24:01] little bit Wednesday to make sure you
[1:24:03] understand in those Church ages you see
[1:24:06] the false Vine and the True Vine and you
[1:24:08] even see the True Vine that's got
[1:24:10] problems yes but at the end of every
[1:24:15] age to him that overcometh that's right
[1:24:18] it's all been taken care of let's stand
[1:24:21] again
[1:24:23] anybody have a need before we go into
[1:24:25] the the communion just to get rid of
[1:24:30] everything let's just sing brother dick

[1:25:19] because he
[1:25:23] love
[1:25:28] me
[1:25:46] just now the Bible says that they when
[1:25:50] they came in and all went through it
[1:25:52] and said they tered one for another we
[1:25:54] generally do this at the last of the
[1:25:56] doing but let's just do it now let's
[1:25:58] just have a moment of solid prayer if
[1:26:01] anybody has any need any problem to get
[1:26:03] rid of Now's the Time to get rid of
[1:26:05] it because that way then you don't have
[1:26:07] no problem if you get rid of if you have
[1:26:10] something you need to get rid of now is
[1:26:11] the time to do it you know and then
[1:26:15] we'll just take a time of taring one for
[1:26:17] another praying one for another all
[1:26:20] right all mind's clear
[1:26:24] cuz see it's not how much worthy I am to
[1:26:27] take the communion there is not one
[1:26:29] person in this building worthy to take
[1:26:33] communion all right there's not one
[1:26:35] person in this world that is worthy to
[1:26:38] take
[1:26:39] communion there is a God that has made
[1:26:43] all True
[1:26:44] Believers worthy to be able to take it
[1:26:47] cu no matter how good you think you are
[1:26:50] that's right the goodness is not
[1:26:52] County that's right right but the
[1:26:56] Badness don't make you good either you
[1:26:58] know we don't emphasize that we
[1:27:01] emphasize the atonement that's right of
[1:27:05] Calvary to make us all clean and
[1:27:08] worthy all right okay let's pray
[1:27:12] silently before the
[1:27:21] Lord

[1:27:43] communion you just have your way with
[1:27:45] each one and lead each and every one of
[1:27:47] us in Jesus
[1:27:50] name Bible says in 1 Corinthians 11:23
[1:27:54] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:27:55] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:27:57] Lord Jesus same night in which he was
[1:27:59] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:28:02] given thanks he broke it and said take
[1:28:04] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:28:06] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:28:10] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:28:12] when he had St saying this cup is the
[1:28:14] New Testament in my blood this do is of
[1:28:17] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[1:28:19] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:28:22] this cup you do you the Lord's death
[1:28:24] till he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:28:26] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:28:28] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:28:31] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:28:33] examine
[1:28:35] himself we're not worthy so examine
[1:28:38] ourselves and depend upon him
[1:28:46] right but let a man examine himself and
[1:28:49] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:28:50] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:28:52] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:28:54] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:28:56] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:28:58] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:29:01] if we would judge ourselves we should
[1:29:03] not be judged but when we're judged
[1:29:05] we're chasen to the Lord that we should
[1:29:07] not be condemned with the world
[1:29:09] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:29:10] together to T to eat t one for another
[1:29:13] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:29:15] home that you come not together under
[1:29:18] condemnation the rest will I set in
[1:29:20] order when I
[1:29:27] come father we thank you for this bread
[1:29:30] it's been made for this purpose this
[1:29:32] afternoon to be able to receive it it's
[1:29:35] unleavened nothing to do any hindrance
[1:29:38] or problems with it but it represents
[1:29:40] your body which is your
[1:29:42] word Lord we just ask you to sanctify
[1:29:45] the bread under partakers we know this
[1:29:47] is not your body but in symbol form but
[1:29:51] we just got through talk talking about
[1:29:52] how great a symbol really
[1:29:54] is to see one lik un to the son of man
[1:29:57] standing in the midst of seven golden
[1:29:59] candlesticks and actually seeing God
[1:30:02] standing there in Bride form and Lord
[1:30:05] Jesus we ask you to just bless and
[1:30:07] sanctify each one with this bread in
[1:30:09] Jesus
[1:30:20] name what about when we get there one
[1:30:23] day and we'll have
[1:30:26] a married
[1:30:28] supper be taking
[1:30:31] communion having a wonderful
[1:30:33] time you can come by and draw all the
[1:30:36] tears from her
[1:30:37] eyes you see Tears in
[1:30:40] Heaven I didn't think there was anything
[1:30:42] wrong with being so happy that you cried
[1:30:45] right you
[1:30:48] know have you ever seen people that
[1:30:50] literally just get so happy to till they
[1:30:52] just start crying you know well there's
[1:30:54] anything wrong with that I just you know
[1:30:58] sorrow is not what you're
[1:31:00] considering you know you're not
[1:31:02] considering it being sad we're
[1:31:05] considering the fact that we're D you
[1:31:06] know what brother rown said he said then
[1:31:09] we'll look across the
[1:31:11] table and see one
[1:31:14] another and realize who made
[1:31:18] it we see each other and we realize with
[1:31:22] our old brother so and
[1:31:24] so you know what does it matter if it's
[1:31:27] a table 49 mil long if you're able to
[1:31:31] see all the way to the end of it without
[1:31:33] s what's the
[1:31:36] problem what are we worried about you
[1:31:38] can spend all of your time trying to
[1:31:40] figure that
[1:31:43] out instead of accepting
[1:31:49] it right okay well we're taking their
[1:31:51] communion remember brother boy and them
[1:31:53] because they're going up to try to visit

[1:32:13] something and and then there was
[1:32:16] problems but you know I don't know but

[1:32:21] years or maybe
[1:32:23] 50 in in jail you know you say well they
[1:32:26] can't do that well they
[1:32:29] can you know if they get the cases
[1:32:32] against you and God's the only one that

[1:32:35] it and we will be praying for the Lord
[1:32:39] to help him yes you know and deliver him
[1:32:42] from those signs just like we pray for
