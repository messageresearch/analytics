[1:28] you've given us and most of allk thank
[1:30] you for your word we love you give you
[1:32] all the glory and honor in Jesus name
[1:34] amen
[1:38] amen now a while back when I started
[1:42] thinking on this the Lord laid this on
[1:44] my heart about the time to plant because
[1:46] I realized that the time I'm in now is a
[1:50] young tender time and especially several
[1:53] years ago um I reached a a time in my
[1:57] life where it was a very decisive time
[1:59] where I I had to make a lot of decisions
[2:02] and I didn't realize then so much how
[2:04] those decisions would affect me in years
[2:06] to come but that's what we're going to
[2:07] talk about is both the natural and
[2:10] spiritual about planting seeds basically
[2:13] about the law of God of sewing and
[2:15] reaping
[2:17] okay
[2:19] now brother how back when in 2006 I
[2:22] graduated from college and there's a few
[2:25] other graduates here with me we had a
[2:26] little graduation party can you hear me
[2:28] mhm okay
[2:30] and brother Hal Thomas gave me some
[2:32] words of wisdom that didn't mean that
[2:34] much to me then I didn't know till later
[2:35] how much those words would mean to me he
[2:37] said Ryan think today about the
[2:39] decisions that you make how they will
[2:41] affect you in a year from now 5 years
[2:44] from now and 10 years from now and so
[2:46] forth so really be thoughtful about the
[2:49] choices you make and at that time it was
[2:51] that was in the spring of 2006 in the
[2:54] fall I met Gabby and then of course we
[2:57] were engaged in the spring of 2007
[3:00] that was one of the biggest decisions of
[3:01] my life also I was making career choices
[3:04] during that time I was making gab I were
[3:07] making family choices we made a lot of
[3:09] big decisions and uh that have affected
[3:13] us ever since then we sewed seeds and
[3:16] now we're reaping and I'm beginning to
[3:17] see that but more importantly I'm seeing
[3:20] how that the seeds of the word that I
[3:22] sow in me in that time were are coming
[3:26] forth now as God is quickening those
[3:28] things see so we want to look at both
[3:31] the natural things and the spiritual
[3:33] things about cause and effect uh sewing
[3:36] and
[3:42] reaping okay Ecclesiastes 3 to
[3:45] everything there is a season and a time
[3:47] to every purpose under the heaven a time
[3:49] to be born and a time to die a time to
[3:52] plant and a time to pluck up that which
[3:54] is
[3:57] planted now I want to start doing an
[3:59] objective I want to start because we
[4:01] come straight in here right out of the
[4:02] world and the things worldly thing not
[4:04] bad things I mean the worldly things
[4:06] traffic and and whatever we're talking
[4:08] about out there we bring it right into
[4:10] here and it's hard to just go right into
[4:11] the word cuz upstairs we have the songs
[4:13] to prepare us for the service but down
[4:15] here we just sit right down and start
[4:18] listen to the word so thereby we might
[4:19] miss some of what's being said and I'm
[4:21] guilty to be sometimes Sunday afternoon
[4:24] I think well what was brother Wade
[4:25] talking about this morning I have to go
[4:27] back and listen to the tape because my
[4:28] mind was still on too other things so
[4:30] for that reason I want to start doing an
[4:32] objective I want to show you one key
[4:35] point one takeaway that you can take
[4:38] away and say well at least I remember
[4:39] this one thing that Ryan talked about
[4:41] this morning so if you don't remember
[4:42] anything else here's our
[4:44] objective to see that our duty is to be
[4:46] the right kind of field and sew the
[4:49] right kind of seed today so that God can
[4:51] give the increase tomorrow okay now you
[4:55] say well Ryan the son of man is the one
[4:57] that slds the seed that's right
[5:00] but we are the ones that read the word
[5:02] pray and study to show ourselves approv
[5:05] we have to plant the word in the womb of
[5:07] our mind before he can Quicken it to us
[5:09] see he's not just going to open our head
[5:11] and pour the word in so that's our part
[5:14] we have something to do with it another
[5:17] words
[5:19] and brother Bob when he was preaching
[5:21] here a while back I think this last time
[5:23] he preached he mentioned something about
[5:26] his experience and it agreed with my
[5:28] experience I found the same thing he
[5:30] said I made a little Discovery that's
[5:31] what he called it any remember him
[5:32] saying I made a little discovery that
[5:35] Discovery was the more you read and pray
[5:37] the more God quickens to you and that's
[5:40] uh you know you think well duh that
[5:42] makes that's obvious well yet it's not
[5:44] really common sense is not so common
[5:46] anymore okay so sometimes see I used to
[5:49] think that I'll just read the certain
[5:51] set amount every day and and no more no
[5:54] less and God will come and Quicken the
[5:56] word in his time well he will that
[5:58] doesn't mean if you don't read and study
[6:00] more that he won't Quicken more word to
[6:01] you you put the word there like David
[6:03] said Thy word have I hid in my heart oh
[6:04] God that I might not sin against thee so
[6:06] see that's our part to do with we keep
[6:08] eating the word keep feeding on that
[6:09] tree of life
[6:12] okay and brother Louise uh Wednesday
[6:16] night preached about uh well the mirror
[6:19] but in that he
[6:20] said James 4:8 draw nigh to God and He
[6:23] will draw nigh to you so thereby then we
[6:26] see the same thing that the more we draw
[6:28] closer to God the more read and study
[6:30] and pray and listen then the more God
[6:32] will come into
[6:33] US Qui am I quiet yeah I feel so
[6:39] loud all
[6:46] right Dave Ramsey a while back on the
[6:48] radio I was listening to him and he said
[6:50] your choices are seeds in the crop of
[6:53] your life and I thought that's very
[6:55] profound that was very enlightening as
[6:58] one of those
[6:59] kind of Common Sense things again it's
[7:01] not so common anymore your choices are
[7:04] the seeds in the crop of your life the
[7:06] natural and the spiritual the seeds you
[7:09] sew in the natural and the seeds you
[7:10] seow spiritually so I want to look at
[7:12] several examples of
[7:15] that
[7:17] again all right first off in your
[7:19] spiritual walk while everybody knows
[7:21] obviously we have one big decision to
[7:23] make in life that is the most important
[7:26] to accept or reject Christ and your
[7:29] Eternal
[7:30] destination lays on that choice the
[7:33] choice that you make to accept or reject
[7:36] Christ and obviously you'll spend
[7:39] eternity with God if you accept him or
[7:42] you'll be eternally separated from him
[7:44] if you reject him that is the most
[7:46] important seed to seow and you'll reap
[7:48] later on what you sow in life now for
[7:50] that but then within that there are many
[7:53] other spiritual choices to be made like
[7:55] within your spiritual walk how close are
[7:57] you going to walk to God are you going
[7:58] to read your Bible and pray every day or
[8:00] ha hazly just as as often as you get a
[8:03] chance cuz you'll never find a chance if
[8:05] you don't make time you'll never find
[8:07] time and Satan's even so are you going
[8:10] to walk close to God or you going to
[8:12] just hang out close to the or near the
[8:14] edge of the cliff so to speak you going
[8:15] to see how close to the world you can
[8:16] get or you going to see how close you
[8:18] get to God are you going
[8:21] to uh come to church every chance you
[8:23] can are you going to listen to sermons
[8:25] every chance you can or not and then
[8:28] within uh and those are seeds that
[8:30] you're sewing and you'll reap later on
[8:31] what you sew and then within marriage
[8:33] that's a the next biggest decision are
[8:36] you going to marry or not and if so who
[8:38] and who will you marry and where will
[8:40] you go to church where will you live
[8:41] those are all choices that have to be
[8:44] made I guess this is not the right
[8:46] audience to be talking to about marriage
[8:49] I mean because because y'all are all
[8:51] married for the most part sorry can you
[8:53] hear me S py can you hear me okay so so
[8:58] I got to
[8:59] y brother wait is so loud I wish I had
[9:02] his
[9:06] loans all right then career like I said
[9:09] a while ago and then your finances is
[9:12] there you have to make a lot of
[9:13] decisions sew a lot of sees and your
[9:15] finances uh for instance like in gabin
[9:19] are we going to handle our finances
[9:20] together or separate and are we going to
[9:24] have a plan to follow called a budget or
[9:27] are we going to just have pasly just do
[9:29] what feels good just spur the moment are
[9:30] we going to save for retirement or are
[9:33] we going to just hope that the
[9:34] government helps us cuz I don't want to
[9:36] be relying on the government if I reach
[9:37] retirement age so about do what you
[9:42] don't have to worry about why
[9:45] time for you to die oh yeah and then
[9:49] your health is another thing you seow
[9:51] seeds in your health what food you eat
[9:54] you know they say you are what you eat
[9:56] so uh I figured that out a while back
[9:58] you know Gab after we got married we put
[10:00] on some marriage weight and I started
[10:02] praying and I prayed since then for
[10:03] years now I prayed Lord help us to lose
[10:05] the weight we're designed to lose to eat
[10:06] healthier exercise more and to take
[10:09] better care of these bodies you've
[10:10] blessed us with and I prayed about it
[10:12] for years not really knowing exactly
[10:15] what to do and sister Anna Canard gave
[10:17] me a video a set of videos that did
[10:19] nothing more than just gave me the
[10:21] information of how to eat healthier what
[10:23] to eat what not to eat and and what's
[10:26] wrong with the food that we do eat
[10:27] usually and all the toxins and things in
[10:30] it and I just started eting healthier
[10:31] and drinking water and everybody thinks
[10:33] I'm dying you know cuz I lost much
[10:35] weight everybody's asking me are you
[10:37] okay well yeah just feel better you know
[10:39] and trying to lose weight and just get
[10:42] in better shape but see those are seeds
[10:44] you sew you reap what you sew you are
[10:46] what you eat I used to eat these greasy
[10:49] biscuits in the morning and I feel so
[10:51] bad all day long just cuz all that
[10:53] grease it just felt like I could feel it
[10:54] clogging my arteries almost it felt
[10:56] terrible and I felt awful felt sick the
[10:59] rest of the day but that's the seed you
[11:01] sow and you reap what you
[11:04] sow uh Proverbs 16:7 says he that
[11:08] keepeth his way preserveth his soul and
[11:12] I think there's also a scripture that
[11:13] says that a man should think on his way
[11:15] is there a scripture that says that
[11:16] think on his way I tried to find that
[11:18] one and that's the only one I come up
[11:19] with he that keepeth or guardeth his
[11:22] soul or his way excuse me PR preserveth
[11:25] his soul so these are ways that you
[11:26] these are things we need to think about
[11:28] be continually ongoingly thinking about
[11:31] all these things spiritual walk marriage
[11:33] family career finances Health just to
[11:36] name a
[11:37] few and you seow seeds in each of those
[11:40] things to reap
[11:46] later okay Galatians 6 be not deceived
[11:50] God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man
[11:52] Seth that shall he also reap for he that
[11:56] Seth to the flesh to his flesh shall of
[11:59] the flesh reap corruption but he that
[12:01] Seth to the spirit shall of the spirit
[12:04] reap life Everlasting and let us not be
[12:07] worry in well doing for in due season we
[12:10] shall reap if we faint
[12:12] not so God is Not mocked you can't
[12:15] bypass the system so to speak you can't
[12:17] get around God you can't seow seeds to
[12:21] your flesh and reap life Everlasting you
[12:24] can't get around this it's a law of God
[12:26] and it will come to pass it cannot fail
[12:30] amen
[12:32] and Brother Dean the night the other
[12:34] night preaching about the Rapture that
[12:36] was enlightening to me about a lot of
[12:38] things but in
[12:40] particular I'm going give you a story
[12:42] when I was about 15 that was in the year
[12:45] 2000 or we're switching over from the 99
[12:47] to 2000 New Year's Eve of 1999 I was a
[12:50] 15-year-old Baptist kid I was standing
[12:53] outside my mom's house where she lives
[12:55] now as I was living there then stood
[12:57] outside and ADM not looking up at the
[12:59] sky waiting for the Eastern Sky to split
[13:02] because look my dad told me every 2,000
[13:04] years in the Bible there's a major event
[13:06] to take place so I and he said maybe the
[13:08] Lord will come he didn't say he would
[13:09] but maybe the Lord will come in
[13:12] 2000 and so I was literally out there as
[13:14] a 15-year-old Baptist kid standing up
[13:16] there looking up the sky where are you
[13:17] Lord but you know I was standing there
[13:20] looking for
[13:21] him and not having any idea that within
[13:24] a couple
[13:25] years the Lord would bring me to the
[13:28] message
[13:29] and let me begin to see the truth cuz I
[13:31] literally thought you'll laugh at this I
[13:33] thought there was going to be a 50 ton
[13:35] brass trumpet and the sky would split
[13:37] open and this trumpet would lower down
[13:39] from the sky and go like brother Dell
[13:41] says and the whole world would hear this
[13:43] trumpet but the Bible says he's coming
[13:45] as a thief in the night so when a thief
[13:47] comes in the night you think well
[13:49] everybody in the house is in bed
[13:51] asleep so a thief's not going to come up
[13:53] to the door and blow a
[13:55] trumpet that's they're not going to
[13:57] sneak out with anything anything that
[13:59] way they're not going to come in there
[14:00] and Barge the door down and and take
[14:01] things they're going to sneak in unwar
[14:03] when you don't have any idea cuz
[14:04] everyone in the world is asleep they're
[14:06] oblivious to what's going on but there's
[14:08] a little bride that is feeding on the
[14:11] word and the Rapture is beginning to
[14:12] build within them the the rapturing
[14:14] faith is beginning to build within them
[14:16] as they feed upon the word and Brother
[14:18] Dean talked about it and laid it out so
[14:19] beautifully and can't remember exactly
[14:21] how he worded it but just basically that
[14:23] we come to a place and it's not going to
[14:25] be a shock or surprise cuz I always
[14:27] thought like a lot of nominal people
[14:30] think today
[14:31] that once you get saved that's it you're
[14:34] in it's your ticket and whenever you die
[14:36] you go to heaven or if the Rapture comes
[14:38] you'll go and that the Lord is going to
[14:40] literally come and just suck you out of
[14:42] here just in a moment that you'll just
[14:44] be gone just like that and that you're
[14:46] going to planes are going to fall out of
[14:47] the sky and trains are going to be
[14:49] wrecking just absolute um obliteration
[14:52] of everything and you think well that's
[14:54] not a thief in the night cuz everybody's
[14:56] going to know what that's going on
[14:57] that's why this left behind movie and
[14:59] all these things deceive everybody it's
[15:00] an absolute deception because these
[15:02] people are daily living their lives
[15:04] serving the devil and yet because they
[15:07] at one time in their life years ago they
[15:09] accepted the Lord and then now they
[15:12] think that just at a moment they're just
[15:13] going to be sucked out of here just like
[15:16] they're you know involuntarily you know
[15:17] going to be sucked out of here but it
[15:19] takes a bride to sit before the Lord and
[15:22] continually feed upon the word and be
[15:24] growing in Grace and knowledge and come
[15:26] to that point of rapturing faith and it
[15:28] won't be you know a big shock or
[15:30] surprise you know to us but it's a
[15:33] secret catching away and
[15:35] then let's read a few quotes am I
[15:38] getting any
[15:40] louder
[15:43] okay comes and
[15:46] goes it's just not ining I don't know
[15:49] that's okay show us the father and it
[15:52] will suffice it'll satisfies
[15:55] us uh that's preaching 1960 731 you you
[15:58] can take a man that looks like a
[16:00] Christian acts like a Christian but if
[16:02] that man hasn't got the word of God in
[16:03] him if there isn't a germ of life in
[16:05] there the germatize that he will never
[16:08] rise in the resurrection that's right
[16:10] cuz he can't rise there's nothing in
[16:11] there to raise him up again a seed now
[16:14] when you bury a seed you Farmers you
[16:15] take and go out and put your corn plant
[16:17] your corn you don't go out every morning
[16:19] and scratch it up say let's see is it
[16:22] growing anything happening to it no put
[16:24] it back down late the next day you say I
[16:25] want to see if it's getting long or
[16:27] right or scratch it up again in it'll
[16:29] never grow like that well the thing you
[16:30] do with a seed you commit it to the
[16:32] ground cover it up and that's all you
[16:34] can do about it it's up to God to do the
[16:36] rest of
[16:39] it well that's the same way it is with
[16:41] the word of God if you take any Divine
[16:42] promise of God he made in his Bible put
[16:44] it in your heart and water it every day
[16:45] with praises of God that's going to come
[16:48] to pass it'll grow if you don't quit
[16:50] fooling with you you just leave it alone
[16:51] don't say let me see can I move my
[16:53] finger any better today do I feel any
[16:55] better is my headache a little bit
[16:56] better oh no it'll never be that just
[16:59] commit it to God and walk away and leave
[17:01] it alone that's God's seed it'll
[17:04] grow and the same applies to the word of
[17:06] God you plan it and commit it to God
[17:08] don't try to figure it out my biggest
[17:10] problem is I try to figure it out I'm
[17:11] all the time thinking about something I
[17:13] really want to see the truth about
[17:15] something I really want something
[17:16] revealed to me so I'll read about it
[17:18] study about it pray about it and then
[17:19] just sit there and scratch it that seed
[17:21] scratch it up out of the ground but I
[17:23] need to just commit it and just leave it
[17:25] and let God do it and someday I'll be
[17:28] riding along chicken truck or walking
[17:29] along and just it just Quicken just like
[17:31] that totally out of my hands you know I
[17:34] can't I can't Quicken it to myself all I
[17:37] can do is plant it and leave
[17:39] it and don't try to figure it
[17:42] out I'm preaching to me so me yall take
[17:47] that if you if it's for you too uh
[17:49] Fellowship 55813 the reason today that
[17:53] Christianity is about fifth place among
[17:55] the religions when it comes to numbers
[17:56] is because we failed to do what Jesus
[17:58] commands us to do the last words that
[18:00] Jesus Christ gave to his church was go
[18:02] into all the world preach the gospel to
[18:04] Every Creature instead of that we have
[18:06] went and taught the Bible Well the
[18:08] gospel doesn't mean the word only Paul
[18:11] said the gospel came not in word only
[18:12] but in power and manifestation of the
[18:14] Holy Ghost the word is a seed but the
[18:17] seed won't grow unless it's placed in
[18:19] the right kind of ground no matter how
[18:20] much seed you've got if you're afraid to
[18:23] sew it afraid to sew afraid see the uh
[18:26] to excuse me the seed will do you no
[18:28] good but listen to this every word of
[18:30] God is a seed Jesus said so and every
[18:32] promise of God will come to pass if you
[18:34] receive it and don't doubt it can place
[18:36] it in your heart and believe it come
[18:38] from God and water with faith it'll
[18:40] spring forth of its kind don't never
[18:42] forget this statement I'll make this
[18:43] from my heart the right mental attitude
[18:46] towards any promise of God will bring it
[18:47] to pass you believe that amen if you'll
[18:50] take the right attitude that it's God's
[18:53] word and God is behind his word and the
[18:55] word is God it'll bring it to pass what
[18:57] it says
[18:58] if you plant wheat you get wheat if you
[19:00] plant corn you get corn if you want to
[19:01] be saved accept his Plan of Salvation if
[19:03] you want to be healed accept his plan of
[19:06] healing here they are he Christ was
[19:09] wounded for our transgressions with his
[19:11] stripes we are healed that's all you
[19:13] have to know the next thing you have to
[19:15] do is to believe it and it'll take care
[19:17] of itself Hallelujah it
[19:23] will we've already read Luke 8 there's
[19:25] Luke 8 um I just read verse 15 again but
[19:29] on the good ground are they which in an
[19:31] honest and good
[19:33] heart have heard the
[19:36] word and as they have heard the word
[19:38] keep it and bring forth fruit with
[19:44] patience okay we are the field or Earth
[19:46] in which the son of man went forth to
[19:48] seow his
[19:51] seed we only have to make sure we are
[19:53] the right top of field in other words we
[19:54] have to make ourselves available God
[19:56] will do the rest
[19:58] God has a time for everything he wants
[20:00] to accomplish in our
[20:03] lives
[20:07] okay trying to do God a service without
[20:10] being the will of God and uh jeffon 6
[20:13] 5718 in the morning now he Reveals His
[20:16] word only in its season Martin Luther
[20:18] read the same Bible we did he Wesley
[20:20] read the same Bible Martin Luther did
[20:22] Pentecost read the same Bible we read
[20:25] Jesus read the same Bible that the
[20:26] Pharisees read but they had trying to
[20:28] keep the corn in an early stage when it
[20:31] was ripening they failed to see their
[20:33] hour now David has done the same thing
[20:35] right here God Reveals His word in the
[20:37] season and to whom he chooses to reveal
[20:39] it to God chooses who he reveals it to
[20:41] he chose that before the foundation of
[20:43] the world all his doing for forn by him
[20:46] hidden from man he just reveals them as
[20:48] he will and his it is his chosen season
[20:51] his chosen person and he never did
[20:53] choose a party or sect it's a chosen
[20:55] person how he does it
[20:59] okay man's natural tendency carnal
[21:01] tendency is to try to get ahead of God
[21:03] and to help him achieve his
[21:05] will Eve tried to fulfill God's Will and
[21:08] her own way instead of waiting on God to
[21:10] do it his way and in his season believe
[21:13] Sarah tried to do the same by giving
[21:15] Hagar to Abraham to fulfill the promise
[21:17] of God uh getting ahead of
[21:21] God
[21:26] okay all right ministers in the message
[21:28] get ahead of God by trying to find
[21:30] something good or tantilizing or
[21:31] entertaining for the people instead of
[21:34] waiting on God to reveal the word in his
[21:38] season
[21:41] um okay Facebook to me this is the
[21:44] Facebook scripture this is what I call
[21:46] the Facebook scripture but shun profane
[21:49] and vain babblings for they will
[21:51] increase unto more ungodliness now
[21:53] Facebook has its place and I believe
[21:54] there are people in this church that use
[21:56] it for good I Believe TV can be used for
[21:58] good as well as radio internet these
[22:00] things are things that we can use but
[22:03] man uses man uses them in the wrong way
[22:06] and uses Facebook for a lot of profane
[22:08] and vain battling right and that
[22:11] increases unto more
[22:13] ungodliness all right and their word
[22:16] will eat as do as do a canker of whom is
[22:18] H and felus who concerning the truth
[22:20] have aired saying that the resurrection
[22:22] has passed already or saying that Jesus
[22:26] wasn't God before the River Jordan
[22:28] and overthrow the faith of
[22:30] some and nevertheless the foundation of
[22:33] God standeth sure having this seal the
[22:35] Lord knowth them that are his and let
[22:37] everyone that nameth the name of Christ
[22:39] depart from
[22:41] iniquity so false doctrines are more
[22:45] popular because they don't have to be
[22:48] lived they are sweet in the mouth but
[22:50] not bitter in the belly if you think
[22:51] about like Jesus wasn't God before the
[22:54] River Jordan that's good in canalizing
[22:55] because that gives people a leg up over
[22:57] the denominations cuz the denominations
[22:59] I say the Baptist I was a Baptist and I
[23:01] believe that Jesus was God the whole
[23:03] time I thought he was born God and he
[23:05] died God but then or that he um but then
[23:10] uh we hear it teach in the message that
[23:14] he wasn't God the whole time that he
[23:15] became God of Riv Jordan and died as
[23:17] just a man and then that gives people in
[23:20] the message they feel good because that
[23:22] I guess because it sets them apart from
[23:24] the people in the world from the
[23:25] denominations and makes them think they
[23:27] know a little bit more than the
[23:28] denomination have but it's nothing that
[23:29] has to be lived it doesn't come down and
[23:31] get where you live and then same thing
[23:34] about most any false Doctrine you name
[23:35] the Seed doctrine that we come with a
[23:37] literal seed of eternal life in Us by
[23:39] our natural birth that makes us feel
[23:41] good but then it doesn't change us it
[23:42] doesn't do anything to to live to take
[23:45] care of this you know carnal being that
[23:47] we are to transform us yes that verse 18
[23:50] is is present right now where they say
[23:54] that the Saints have raised Old
[23:56] Testament Saints have raised already
[23:58] uhhuh but we know we've been taught that
[24:01] then without us can't be made perfect
[24:04] yeah so it isn't that kind of a body mhm
[24:07] it's not a glorified body like Jesus had
[24:11] cuz he's the only one that has that kind
[24:13] of a body right right yeah and then
[24:18] um and it's like this too I use you know
[24:22] brother R talked about the analogy of
[24:23] the Cherry Pie when you keep eating you
[24:26] eat cherry pie then when you hit a SE
[24:27] you spit it out and keep eating pie and
[24:30] brother Brandon he was a forerunner and
[24:32] he was the first to come out of the
[24:34] denominations of his day and and to come
[24:36] and bring forth this message that we
[24:38] believe so he was preaching to a lot of
[24:39] people that only had seed pie or bony
[24:43] chicken okay and he talked about the
[24:45] Bony chicken if you're eating fried
[24:46] chicken and and you hit a bone spit out
[24:48] the b the bone and keep eating chicken
[24:51] well we don't have an excuse we have a
[24:53] boneless chicken breast here that we can
[24:56] partake of all the time we don't have to
[24:59] eat the Bony chicken so what I'm saying
[25:02] is this if you if you miss church on a
[25:05] Wednesday night and you can't be here
[25:07] and you have the choice to pull up one
[25:09] of these bigname preachers or brother
[25:11] Dell pull up brother Dell you know uh if
[25:14] you and if you if you especially if you
[25:16] know these bigname preachers are into
[25:18] false Doctrine because the thing is
[25:19] those things are tantalizing to the
[25:21] flesh they uh they feel-good doctrines
[25:24] and they're feel-good
[25:26] preachers but you know I think about
[25:27] about this uh Jesus was the Bible says
[25:32] talked about him in
[25:34] Isaiah being having no beauty that we
[25:36] should desire him no form or commonness
[25:39] and you know the message comes forth the
[25:40] word comes forth in that way it's not
[25:42] tantalizing to the flesh but yet it's
[25:44] feeding our soul okay so that's why
[25:46] whenever I I kind of bulk at anything
[25:48] that kind of makes me feel good and
[25:50] makes me uh get goosebumps or something
[25:52] I start thinking well wait a second here
[25:53] is this really right frankly I fall
[25:56] asleep a lot of times upstairs when my
[25:57] soul is being fed my outer body is so
[26:00] bored to death that I'm falling asleep
[26:02] you know I have to really fight and stay
[26:03] awake but yet I want that for my soul
[26:06] that's what I'm trying to say I want to
[26:07] feed my
[26:09] soul so I think you know a lot of people
[26:12] maybe use that as an excuse to say well
[26:14] I'll just eat this bony chicken and just
[26:16] spit out the bones and keep eating the
[26:17] chicken cuz that chicken is so good well
[26:19] we've got some bonus chicken breast here
[26:21] that we can partake of any
[26:23] time uh sin looks good and it looks
[26:26] beautiful too that's another thing about
[26:28] sin about these false doctrines these
[26:30] tantalizing false doctrines they look so
[26:33] good but it doesn't do anything for the
[26:35] inner
[26:36] man all
[26:38] right I know there was more to be said
[26:41] about that but that's all I got
[26:45] now I'm going to refer back to this
[26:48] scripture
[26:49] again uh remember Galatians 6 ver8 for
[26:53] he that Seth to his flesh now that's
[26:56] where the false doctrines sow to the
[26:59] flesh shall let the flesh reap
[27:02] corruption but he that Seth to the
[27:04] spirit shall the spirit reap life
[27:06] Everlasting so seow the seeds to your
[27:09] soul seow the word of God partake of the
[27:12] word that feeds your soul
[27:17] okay now let's see the believer's
[27:21] position in Christ in
[27:22] 1955 January 16th then Moses lost all
[27:26] the hopes let me double check make sure
[27:29] that I need to read all that
[27:31] one let me
[27:33] um yeah better
[27:38] ahe okay God has times for season he has
[27:41] season for his word he has times when
[27:43] the scripture here where it said and the
[27:45] presence of the Lord was there to heal
[27:46] the sick that's when Jesus was
[27:47] ministering to and the presence of the
[27:49] Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at
[27:50] other times the presence of the Lord
[27:52] wasn't there to heal the sick and we
[27:53] find out that God works everything
[27:55] seasonally now when Moses
[27:58] and what he failed to find was the time
[28:01] limit of
[28:05] God figure out what I've got time
[28:08] for time then when God revealed himself
[28:11] to him in the burning bush he found out
[28:13] that when the very that was in The
[28:15] Burning Bush was the thing that he
[28:17] lacked and I think that's a whole lot
[28:19] with us today that many times we tried
[28:21] to do the program ourselves and failed
[28:22] to get what was in the burning bush the
[28:24] direct revelation of the will and time
[28:26] of God what good would it do to plant
[28:28] some corn out here today which this was
[28:30] in January it would rot it'd be nothing
[28:33] would happen if it happened to sprout
[28:35] the cold weather would kill the germ see
[28:37] it wouldn't work we got to have the time
[28:39] SE season for it excuse me all right let
[28:42] me
[28:45] um we must be patient and wait for God
[28:49] to achieve his will and his
[28:53] time patiently endure uh for Hebrews 6
[28:57] 15 I'll just get down to read that one
[29:00] youall read this before because we're
[29:01] running out of time and so after he had
[29:03] patiently endured he obtained the
[29:05] promise okay patiently enduring waiting
[29:08] on God for his time always be diligent
[29:10] and study the word of God daily even if
[29:13] you don't feel like you're gaining
[29:14] ground just like natural growth in
[29:17] Plants spiritual growth is very slow and
[29:19] cannot be noticed on a day-to-day
[29:22] bases he okay provers 10:4 he becometh
[29:25] poor that deal with a slack hand but the
[29:27] hand of the diligent maketh Rich there's
[29:29] natural and spiritual types to that
[29:31] obviously study to show th second
[29:34] Timothy 2:15 study to show thyself
[29:35] approved unto God a Workman that needeth
[29:37] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[29:39] word of
[29:41] Truth all right our objective again do
[29:44] you see that our duty is to be the right
[29:46] kind of field and SE the right kind of
[29:48] sea today so that God can give the
[29:50] increase tomorrow give me a nod yes
[29:54] okay amen amen then oh the go upstairs
[29:58] like
[30:00] that
[30:01] questions any a question you did very
[30:18] good
