kind of cute you know as well babies are cute and we get to this middle stage we're not so cute then we get old I ain't got to the old age cuteness yet but I came to the Lord so they the everything they asked her to try to find out what's wrong with her to give him some kind of funny answer so she's just cute and they trying to trying to heal her because they don't know what's wrong with her when she fell and lay on the floor for maybe eight hours don't know how she got there how she got up so but we we're thankful doing Lord that he blessed us to get this for and uh I hope I live long enough to be cute again but we're going to read from Psalm 111 verses 1 through 10. let us let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you this day God for this privilege and opportunity unless you've given

forever amen God bless you thank you amen this time we're going Worship the Lord and ties in all friends this morning I have brother Kern if he doesn't mind come and help us this morning um just wanna if I can give a little a little testimony uh have a a friend co-worker and he uh name's Jack and we I requested prayer for him has been probably a year and a half maybe something like that but uh he had cancer the esophagus and they had to take his esophagus out and they had to reattach us stomach because he doesn't have an esophagus to attach it and he was really really bad and got really lost a lot of weight got real sick but uh kept a positive attitude he's a he's a Christian and he's just been having his faith in the Lord had a real positive confession the whole time and um you just took him took him a while to get over that but turned the corner done real well got back to work put on weight and everywhere he went he was out testifying what the Lord had done for him and a few months ago he said I just started to feel different said I didn't and he was afraid that the cancer had come back which he was telling me there was a there's a little test that they can do and then the test results your normal human should be somewhere around zero or close to zero but he said if that number gets up to 20 he said they can tell but that number good up to 20 he said they can tell there's cancer cells there he went and had the test done and it was 668. but he said didn't lose his confession he said because the Lord brought him through the first time the Lord to bring him through again and so he's uh every time he gets new test result he brings them to me so his first one was 668 the next one was 354. the next one was 150 something and he brought me one the other day and it's down to 16. and so thank the Lord he's got one more test result and I told him I said well I'll mention that to the church y'all just just pray his next test he said he expects it to be zero so just thank the Lord I said well you give the Lord you know we give the devil a black eye the first time we give the devil's blackout a second time so we appreciate the Lord and His blessings and just wanted to pass that on for the current come by your choosing Lord father yes we pray Lord God all people that I got it here those young internet yeah promised them in a study word Lord may we have the right mental attitude we attitude like that brother there that was just testified about Lord I pray Lord God that the world will accomplish that will be settled for that Lord that your blessing is no signs

holy I want to see you amen you come to see him today then he'll give you the desire of your heart you come to see each other that's okay but let's see the Lord first and let's see the Lord and each and every one of us so turn around Shake somebody's hand say God bless you good to be in the house of the Lord today gonna have each and every one of you with us remember brother Bob is it with Larry Harris today and uh he's uh preaching for him and and brother Joe Canada they're on vacation and uh several that are out we sure miss them amen we appreciate the ones that are here that have that have got back brother Louise and different ones that were going last weekend we're sure looking for a good time in the Lord and we know one thing's for sure the devil's on a rampage he don't like us we don't like him either that's kind of weak we don't like him either that's right amen I I sometimes you do as brother Dales always said you kind of feel sorry for the God because but you know it was his choice it was his choice to be who he was he wasn't the anointed cherub he was going to be God's right-hand man and boy you see how that turned out his own will came apart came up and he iniquity was found in him so wow man could that be the same with me and you because we'll look at today you don't want things for sure Satan can't condescend he's Hardy he wants to be on the mountain he wants the side of the north he wants to be God he don't want to be like God now he wants to be God he wants to sit on his own Throne have his own and we'll talk about that today because selfishness comes in to this being brotherly kindness so by way of announcements uh you remember brother Joe and then brother Bob and remember brother and sister Dale uh thank you for coming to prayer service last night we had a good time in the lord always peaceful time to come and just let the world be out there and then come in here and and be in the shelter of the almighty so we sure appreciate that remember on

the menus and get written down what you want and get them into Terence and Lisa today or at least by Wednesday all right also remember July 14th 15th 16th the deadline is over to go to um Tennessee at brother Andre heads but if you'd like to go you need to let us know but we're getting the rooms um uh Tuesday brother Andre's out out of town right now but Tuesday we're going to get the rooms it'll be there close to Johnson City and they'll be really nice and it'll be uh well I think we're gonna have to get 15 rooms because there's 53 of you going and we sure do appreciate that and they do too and yeah I know you don't know the background a lot of you don't but that brother would be brother Charlie would be uh and dad were friends for for many many years back in the 70s that's where they met Brother Richard Wilson because that was brother would be brother-in-law all right so they were all head of church there in Irwin and we used to go I mean every month we would go or they would come down here but most time we'd go up there because there was a big group of them at that time and not very big here so they became really good friends and then this is the this is the kids and grandkids and some of them are still the science to the ones that were there that knew us when we were kids they're still there they're just older and um and brother Andres the pastor there now brother would be passed away and uh brother Andre heads the pastor there so we're we're going to go up there and have a youth service but it's going to be a service for all of us on Friday uh we'll have um just Fellowship Friday with some coal sandwiches and stuff Saturday we'll have a brother Joe and brother Andre's working on the whole day of activities and then Saturday afternoon about five o'clock um brother Joel Brown from brother Donnie Reagan's Church he'll be there with us to do the youth service part all right and then the next day on the 16th I'll be speaking the Sunday morning there will not be a Sunday afternoon service and we will stay over the ones that want to stay over you need to let me know some of you already have there's a place called The Farmer's Daughter and it's a really good place to eat it's Amish owned Meat and three Tony's gonna love it this place is just good it's I'm talking about they take it from the field into the restaurant if it's you know during season but it's a real good place to eat but if you want to stay and eat after the service is over they've reserved a place for about 50 people in the back of the restaurant and you're sure welcome to come now remember the church will be paying for you rooms but you'll have to get your own transportation you can carpool together and your own food you shouldn't have to have too many meals outside of that and then your your gas in your meals you'll have to take care of all that so we sure do appreciate all of you that are going 53 that's pretty good like I said before brother Andre said oh bro wait we can handle a group I said we got 50 people coming he said oh bro wait we've only had a group to us is 10. I said well a 53 of Us coming so you better get you you know put your big britches on and and get the big mule out get the big horse out you know so but they're they're already working I talked about Andre yesterday they're they're already working and getting stuff ready to go so and we need to pitch in and help when we get up there it's not just a vacation time where we just go and see it no we need to pitch in and help them because they are a very small church and and we're bringing twice as many as what they have in church service so you know that's that's going to put a little strain on them but we sure do appreciate that we want to uh invite all of you to um talk to each other about who to ride with and different things and carpool together if you wish to but I do need to know if you're going to stay over for a farmer's daughter all right and and eat afterwards because we need to know the lady needs to know all right also remember Bethel Camp I think brother Ryan he talks those so low I can't hear him so you need to talk a little bit louder learn from your daddy okay but the Bethel can't remember go online and and please we want to participate as a church if you can take a couple of days off or see it in your heart to work on maybe a Saturday or a Sunday uh they need 40 people to help in the kitchen because they don't have 300 something kids but there'll be up 40 people in the kitchen because this year the camp they're at now or this year this year coming up no one helps in the kitchen so they pretty much got it all they don't have Camp kitchen help all right like they did at the other one but this one I know some of you already signed up to be counselors and different things but we want to support them we're actually probably the closest church that's affiliated with with with brother Jason Watkins we're the closest church to it up there in Travelers Rest just about an hour and 15 minutes from here so we can it's like four hours for them so they're having to haul all their stuff up there so let's kind of take the burden off if you see it in your heart go to Bethel Camp I think it's um Youth Camp Bethel Youth Camp go on Facebook you'll find it and there'll be a space there for you to sign up for kitchen help all right go in and put your name in it and uh and let's help them out okay I'm gonna try my best to be there maybe a day or two myself so also remember July 29th uh we're working on having a Saturday um singing and dinner on the ground I've talked to several people about coming we'll not discuss that now but but July 29th on Saturday at four o'clock and then about six o'clock we'll have some um maybe some soup and sandwiches or something like that and then we'll have another session of of testimony if you want to work on songs bring your instruments and we'll have a day of worship all right I'm going to try to get a brother to come which is a good singer and and never heard him preach before but I'd like brother um um brother Dwayne Jackson from Brother um Joe Greene's church I'm going to try to get him to come and Minister for us and he's also a very good singer so let's just keep that in prayer all right all mine's clear let's let's jump into the word of God we're still on the son of man I want to bring out something that that maybe we'll help each and every one of us today and we pray that that you'll pray for the ones that are sick that's just burdened on my heart the whole time whole weekend a whole week about people that are sick that can't get here so let's bow our heads dear Lord we've we've sung the songs we've we've done all the ordinances of the church Lord now father we bow our heads to ask you Lord to come Among Us in a special way bring your anointing Lord to each one of us just bathe us and saturate us with your Holy Spirit Lord may we feel your presence Lord and even if we don't we know the word has already been anointed father I pray that you would bless us as we speak your word Lord and as we hear your word father that you would be with each one that's in the sound of my voice Lord the ones on the internet the ones that are home the different ones that are that are clicking in father I pray this should be with them Father wherever they are be with the ones here in this building Lord ever forgive us of our sins Lord and let us be mindful Lord that you're always with us and you said you would never leave us and never forsake us so whatever we're going through today Lord you will be there with us just bless us now in a further on this service in Jesus name amen let's read our familiar scripture in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and it's continuing to be made flesh I want us to see that that's a continuing that what didn't just happen 2000 years ago and gone bye-bye no it's happening like as a region met brother Brown said deity fell on the day of Pentecost and it's still falling down all right so we're going to believe that we call it the Holy Ghost but it is deity all right it's part of the deity of the what people call the Trinity or the godhead of father-son Holy Ghost all right that's what we're looking at we're not looking at three different people but we're looking at an anointing then we're looking at the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not exactly an anointing in itself it's a person it's the birth part then you have anointings or or refillings or you see up here on the top of the pyramid we'll get to that so I want to kind of um what they always old expression I want to prime the pump get the pump prompt so you be thinking about that because the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on a group of people it birthed them it went inside of them and they became different people and that's when the word of God became alive and flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the goal of the only begotten the father full of grace and truth you can go ahead and have your seat second Peter 1 verse 5 brother Louise did a great job today that's a good job man and he did I like it when people enjoy speaking I like that Peter says and besides this in other words besides what I just told you besides the new birth giving all diligence add to your faith virtue in the verse of knowledge and all these Temperance Temperance patience to patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity and then as brother Louise said if these things be in you what and abound they will make you they will turn you into Jesus Christ and human flesh on the face of this Earth amen with the characteristics of God not just anointing you we'll talk about that in a minute but living inside of you that's the whole difference of a nominal Christian which can be anointed which can be an anointed one which can be a foolish virgin but they are just anointed by temporary anointing you and I are if you're born again today you don't have a temporary anointing you are the anointing you are part of that anointing that is falling and and and Joel promised it following All Flesh listen these people these singers They're rappers and all that they're all anointed they're anointed to do what they're going to do they have been anointed but remember it's a perverted anointing theirs is and it's something that comes on them and comes off of them as we're going to see in the Old Testament that's exactly what happened to that group of people so let's just remember that as we continue on Colossians 1 verse 21 to you that were sometimes alienated enemies in your mind by Wicked works you now has to be reconciled so we come to the New Birth we've been reconciled back to Christ and we don't have just an anointing like I said before we have that person inside of us then he's going to work itself out but you and I as human beings we need these different anointings I always enjoyed well I always enjoyed brother Homer anyway but all the times we were going to the camp over there in Alabama for about eight years General were counselors and and brother um he'd have brother Ron Spencer or or brother Danny steamman be up there preaching him and then when they get finished with the service and get ready to start praying for people brother Homer would step up he said okay now that now the anointing has changed see there was anointing of preaching brother Brown had an anointing of preaching why didn't he just flow right on in no he said hey I'm waiting on him while he was waiting on another anointing to come for the time so the anoint him for the time to pray for the sick is now on the preachers what brother Homer would say so come up let's come up for prayers for salvation the preaching's over seeds have been planted the ground's either good bad or indifferent all right let's you know what let's reap the benefits so the anointing of the prayer for the sick or the prayer for hey when you say praying for the sick we always think sick sick if you're not born again today you are sick your soul is sick that's right so we have a healing of the Soul first and then we have a healing of a body so in the body of his flesh through death to present you now he died we'll look at it just a few minutes and I'll get back to what I said because remember God is the only one that will come down to get us yes he's the only one that will condescend down to get man and not be selfish Satan will never condescend down all right never he's got a haughty Spirit a selfish Spirit we're listen where does all that contrary Spirit come from does the contrary Spirit come from the Lord it can't so everything that comes that way negative comes from the devil that's an anointing that he puts on us and as brother Branham says and we'll read if we get to it he he got a selfish Spirit on him the prophet if you'll read the message of the hour he was the most transparent man that ever lived never kept a secret thank God he'd tell you that he was almost a murderer that he was almost he almost committed suicide amen that that he's got complexes that he wanted to just go back in the woods and stomp out and the Lord said no no no that's not you that's not what I want from you this is what I want for you I want you to be with the people but he says here he has a selfish Spirit on it that's all of our problems but see Satan he doesn't want to deal with none of that he wants to stay up here but God's going to condescend down the Lord can do that he knows how to get low so that what he can take us High Satan just wants to stay up there and then drag you down that's what's so interesting he wants to be the God of this age but everything he touches he destroys amen and he's destroying us now in our body I was looking at at dad and the different ones you look at your body and our bodies are just dying there's nothing you can reverse at the moment because even brother Branham that brother down was 92 years old and brother and he was almost dying well he was dying in brother Brown announced that he would shake his hand again on the street or at the Tabernacle right remember that well whatever happened to brother now just that little piece got turned back whatever that was he still was 92 he still couldn't get out of a car very fast he still died all right but so now what we're looking at is the anointing on the end time today is that we don't have to fool with that kind of a devil and we can just say hey I like what brother Cauley he said don't tell people I died Christians can't die brother Carly died a long time ago when he was a young man young skinny guy used to come to church here where'd that man go he's still there he just protected by layers me too all of us hello somebody but he died a long time ago you can't kill a Christian if you'll see it that way so to present you whole now how we how do we see that way God came and did it yes yes so that we could see it that way say you're not going to ever let you see it that way he's always going to be the negative guy I always say you're hurting and you're dying and you got this and you got that just remember if you're a Christian today everything that Satan keeps on you is going to be heaped back on him amen it's going to be heat back on him and then we're going to live for an eternity in in in wonderful Bliss and guess what he's going to Bear every iniquity he's going to Bear every pain he's going to Bear every demon that was turned loose on us is going to be turned back loose on him right but now we're looking at the Lord and he's going to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight look if you continue if you continue in the faith settled and grounded and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is Under the Sun whereby Paul had been made a minister I was thinking yesterday you take all this group of ministers we got yeah we know brother Dale's not preaching now and he's going through some issues and and we're all praying that that will be resolved but think of the group of people might as well give her Rose or because I'm a recipient of it and so are you think of the people that that brother Dale that that he's he's I won't say that he spawned a group of people Underneath Him that really knows the truth of Daniel 70 weeks the truth of the seals the truth of the different things and then now they're out and now then see they're out preaching you know they're out preaching the word of God so it didn't return void it accomplished all those years of breaking every a and in D and all sometimes we get bored and we fall back when we go to sleep and all these different things because he wasn't some fiery you know bringing it you know and and Hell firing Brimstone but he was planting something inside of a group of people all right and I promise you Brother Richard Wilson we'll agree with you brother Jimmy Harris will agree with you brother Dean Gibby will agree with you all those different ones that are out there they will agree yes that they were helped by Brother Dale's Ministry so it's not diminished it's just more that's the problem with Satan he tries to destroy that cut it off and God said no I just got it in somebody else uh no I just got it in 70 others no no no not just you Moses I got 70 people uh hold on Elijah Don't Be grumbling I got several thousand hit away that have not bowed the need to bail I have a group of people that said away that doesn't take all the garbage in this message hello somebody all right and tries to shove it down to people's throat we've been taught well so we're going to continue on somebody's gonna make it we are going to make it and we are going to be this what he said right here through the ministry you're going to be presented holy and unblameable and unreprovable in God's sight and listen that's not wait until we get over there that's right here's where we conquer there's where we enjoy the victory here's where we conquer right here starts today there's your day of your salvation today the gospel has come to you in power and demonstration or sometimes we don't think so sometimes we think we have boring meetings but guess what the word will not return void it will accomplish in somebody something that he has already planned and you just open yourself up and you what today you bring good ground or either you brought Stony ground that's what the r or you brought ground that's totally dry because you hadn't been wet all week by the water of the word amen like brother Louise said we know one thing's for sure water's wet water's wet there's no there's no mystery well you know what this gospel is the truth there's no mystery we're in the right place and I'm not talking about sitting here and I'm talking about the right message of the hour We're in the message of the hour so let's just live it out because you know what one thing's for sure and I'll read it just a minute when when when those people were called Disciples Jesus called him disciples right you know what that word if you break it down that word disciple means discipline they were disciplined to what Jesus was saying there was a group of people that wasn't Fair season Sadducees they were not disciplined to what Jesus was saying but the disciples even though they didn't know every little a and indeed they stayed there long enough to where God prayed for him Jesus prayed for him in John 17 as we read many times before he prayed for that group of people and me and you that all right what's the mystery the mystery of this whole thing is is Christ in you the hope of glory Christ is going to be in you not coming back in human flesh until the Millennium so it's all laying on a group of Gentiles bride and a group of Jews 144 000 that's all that's left that's right everybody with me there's no more prophets to come no more Church ages to come no more Messengers right there's none of that this is it this is the finish the final voice to the final age under our messenger not under Luther not under Wesley not under Pentecost that's right under our messenger that we I hope we're sitting here today agreeing with that God sent us a messenger so that you know why so that he can spawn Church listen they wasn't a message church when brother Raymond was here they were still Methodist Baptist Pentecost the awesome came out you had some Independence and different ones but remember when brother rhyme died a lot of them went right back to their denomination God there was nowhere else to go all right but thank God there was people like brother mode brother Dale different ones in the 60s brother Mike Canada different ones and if I miss somebody I'm sorry but take these Warriors of faith that that caught the message at least caught part of it and brought it to the people thank God that's how he works God's going to do that he's going to have a bride whether we want to be it or not all right which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach you have heard in this church it is Christ in you the hope of glory it's not just an anointing it's not just we love the message and we love brother Dale and we love brother so-and-so's this and singing and we love this we that don't have one thing to do with it it's the love of God the Bible says that shed abroad in your heart all right so it's costing you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus and that's where we get into godliness is that is the Perfection as brother Louise said here's the same quote from statue of perfect man brother Brown said oh yes you can oh I can't brother Branham oh yes you can you know what to me that's the saith the Lord yeah that's right that's the set the Lord to a prophet that says yes you can the door has been opened where you can what receive and not receive like Lutheran Wesley they were all closed doors we're open doors to what to the truth not to error to the truth oh yes you can then we've been talking about deity it fell on the day of Pentecost we love that oh fellow you know 120 upper room and 3 000 downstairs and oh praise the Lord they spoke in tongues and they baptized them it fell here too it's still falling but what the whole thing is that deity that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same that you got today plus the anointing of the age and by with me plus the anointing of the age not another Holy Ghost but Plus the open book right because even on the day of Pentecost they weren't working under an open book they didn't understand what the seals were wasn't supposed to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that was good enough for them at the moment and They Carried that on and they healed the sick raised the dead what's our problem well praise the Lord anyway they only do his will he's talking about uh pick up your pen and write so this is the Holy Ghost writing to me and you all right they do only his will amen I believe that no one can persuade them different now see we have been persuaded not we but I say the message of the hour has been persuaded into all these different factions and all these different ideas about the message of the hour amen but brother Brown said they have thus set the Lord and they keep still in other words if you have thus says the Lord yeah move if we don't have thus says the Lord sit still all right then they will do the works of God what is it the gospel the preaching of the word of God for it is himself in them all right it's himself in them not an anointing this world is Anointed but you and I have come through a birth as he did complete in his day all things when he was here he did not complete all when he was here for it was not time yet so what is the completion of the Gospel or the word of God it's me and you sitting here today there is not another I just don't believe Brothers 90 there's going to be another generation if we're here another 40 years about 90 percent of everything gonna be here all right I hope that don't happen I'm praying that this generation will see the coming of the Lord through a group of people they're not going to see the coming of the Lord in the cloud open these no they're going to see it in a group of people and they're going to be at brother Brown said just for a moment there'll be a powerful group I believe when we get toward the end of this thing when we get toward the body change Nothing's Gonna harm us death will just be something that you talk about not something you're scared of them and to the doctrine which is according to Godliness what is a Doctrine a set of ideas or beliefs that are taught or believed to be true that's what I was saying just a few minutes ago we have we have a Doctrine here at this church everybody has a Doctrine all right we have a Doctrine brother Brown said every church needs a Doctrine to be a very successful Christian to and to be first step in successful Christianity sorry is to show that man has received the Holy Spirit is humility all right do it in humbleness real god-given humility now I want you to remember humility is not having no backbone though because brother Brown I believe he caught that and he said oh oh wait a minute it must be humble but yet a church without a Doctrine is like a jellyfish it has no backbone so we've got to have backbone in it is to be given humbly but it's not to be smacked around and used any way you want to no it's going to have a purpose and I'd also back bone but it's got teeth amen because the Church of God must eat the bread of life Romans 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the Gospel how many of us are not ashamed of the Gospel I'm not ashamed of this thing that we're that we're in I'm not ashamed of that of the gospel of Christ for what there's your power to not be ashamed is power power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth we'll get to this in just a minute we talked a little bit last time about the filter and this Veil we understand that if we if we in the Garden of Eden if we've been driven out I say we when Adam and Eve got driven out we got driven out with them all right everybody with me nobody stayed in the Garden of Eden they got driven out we got driven out with them but there was a promise in in Genesis 3 fit thing that we were going to go back that he was going to come what and condescend to a baby die for us and then take us back home all God was he poured into cross Christ in the church Hallelujah take her back to the Garden of Eden so back to an eating condition so what was it in Eden the reason they didn't know that we're naked because there was a holy ghost Veil on them from nakedness so we need a holy ghost Veil for that plus other things all right they didn't know it now listen there is no way I'm just going to be plain there's no way you can look at somebody and not see this or naked not now because we're out from under that Veil all right but now remember there's a group of people though that thinks they have clothes on ah Revelations Thou Art blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it that's the perversion that has come from the garden but listen we're not caught in that praise God we've been brought above that we have that Holy Ghost bail now back on us I really believe that we have that Holy Ghost spelling that you say well now what we still have problems amen but your soul by the baptism of my Holy Ghost when I look at a naked somebody and when we say naked we don't mean just uncloged we mean unclothing other things like gospel and all the different things outside all right because a whole it says the Bible says in the end time they'll be naked yes but they won't know it all right but we'll know it but we're going back to where the Holy Ghost put a veil over their eyes they see nothing but their brother and sister see now this is a key because this is what we're coming to in brotherly kindness because there's a real fine line more fine than my finger between filial love lust down this way because you know what you can say I love my brother and love my sister and love him wrong if you love them feelio that's where people get in trouble with adulteries because you have to be careful even as a minister you don't ministers and it do not be caught in a room with a woman by himself try not to if you're going to talk to somebody talk out in public but if if somebody wants to talk to to me a sister June goes with me because you just don't know it's not it's like really Gary Longoria said he said it's not you that we don't trust it's the devil we don't trust him we don't trust the devil so we don't want to do that we want to do everything what be brothers and sisters shake a hand say God bless you and do like we're learning Villanueva told Mama he said sister I said I love your sister Peggy so much I give you a hug he said but I can't he said but I'll give you one in the millennium all right well he's over there waiting in the sixth Dimension okay he's waiting over there and I'm sure he's been hugging everybody out man hugger but that's all right with me I don't mind if it's done in a proper way it's it's holy and without blame but if it's done in an Unholy way now look now the spirit of unholiness uncleanness and lust has veiled them education science all right that's what the prophet said to us now I want to I want to cover one thing this right here real quick because I think it's important to understand when we talk about when we talk about what happened in the Old Testament as far as as anointings and as far as them not having the new birth see that's a strange Doctrine to a lot of people too uh you talk to people in the message even they say oh yeah Abraham was born again no Abraham was not born again Moses was not one again that was the Old Testament no one could get born again under the blood of an animal they're sin the sin was still there but now the below to Jesus Christ remember holy yes unblameable all right the only way you can do that is take it away hey man everybody with me so now Genesis 1 26 we go back to this scripture and you know I love it but you continue pulling the the layers off the the onion peel you keep peeling the onion you keep getting the same thing keep getting onion no matter how thin it is so this to me the Statue of perfect man this is a key to understand Genesis 1 26 that God said let us make man in our image so now if you if we look at that and we we look at it with just normal eyes then the world and even most denominations will tell you that's every human being that was ever on the face of the Earth that's not brother Brandon was real clear about that that's not every human being that's only the redeemed that's only his children listen Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph David Sampson all the different ones that they're not the children of God they're not his genealogy they are in the economy of God yes sir they are and will be given eternal life amen and they will have a seat and a position because the 12 Patriarchs all right you got your 12 disciples now we know they were born again but then you got your 12 Patriots that are over here in the Old Testament they weren't born again but they're what they're giving eternal life they have a position a position in God and we'll look at it just a second but it said let us make man in our image so whatever he made it was in the image of God it looked like God acted like God and was a part of God all right amen and let them have dominion so he he gave them a power he gave them a Dominion to have over the whole the fish of the sea fouled the air cattle we we understand let's keep going so God created whoever he whatever this person is God said here you're in my image I have give you power over this world Cosmo uh not not the cosmos I'm sorry but the dirt the world and even actually Adam ran the economy of the world he ran everything so God created man his own image so whatever that was done we know that word created is not it's formed it's not created because it always was a part of God what he done was he said okay I'm gonna have some kids it's going to look like me here they are right right that's right God Alone by itself with his stocks before the foundation in the world before anything was even formed before there was a star moon angel we were here he said I'm gonna make somebody that's like me that's come out just like me and there he is in my image he looks like me he acts like me he is me only God can do that I can act like Dad look like that and all these different things but I have my own DNA I have on my own person right but now we we through the fall got our own personality but what's it doing come on people it's working our way back to that image because when you got born again this image came into your soul yes and it burned the old image out didn't kill your soul burn it out listen God can burn and not kill come on what are some Hebrew children in a turn this one time hmm talk about a body change I've walked around some real hot furnaces and grills and some real hot fire and I mean red hot Jim's dad used to we used to have a fire at Thanksgiving and that poor old uh um he took two actually took two big tight big tire inner things of a tractor-trailer welded them together and we used to make that thing a red hot you could touch it with a stick on the outside and it would burn well you know what the Hebrew children they met that times about a hundred because I'm sure there wasn't a little bitty firmer furnace that all three of them had to struggle to get in no it was a big old furnace with big old doors because when they opened the doors up it killed the ones that were around him talk about a body change see that's a precursor to me and you yeah it's not going to matter if they shoot Bombs all over the place and you're if you're in a glorified body ain't gonna hurt you because it's not gonna hurt that one inside because that was made in His image this is eternal as Eternal as God is because it came from God it was formed from God into an image and what happened was we lost that image in the garden yeah amen Adam didn't lose eternal life he lost the ability to produce that image over and over again everybody with me all right he he lost he lost the godship to that degree that him and Eve could not bring forth any children the way they were supposed to because the womb of her mind and the womb of her body was polluted and God couldn't said okay hang on man I gotta put this back I need to save this but I'm going to anoint a group of people I'm going to anoint a Moses and a Samson and a Abraham and a I'm going to anoint them and make them examples of this that's coming amen amen because I can't put this in a womb now I'm talking about this womb I can't put it in this womb now right right everybody with me you're gonna have to come through the normal womb or the the perverted womb you're gonna have to come by childbearing and all those other things everybody with me on this but that's the character though that when we got born again that's the character that we got we got that thing let's call it a thing the Bible did that thing in you right that thing that's in you is that Genesis 1 26 man no less no more but it's encapsulated inside of your not glorified body that's why sin is so bad even when you attach eternity yeah to your human body you still got problems you've still got Spirit problems you still got flesh problems but not Soul problems if you're born again listen if you're not born again you've got all three problems it's all body and spirit Paul said I wish that what your soul body and spirit be blameless now he didn't come to that you and I that was a prophecy for us to come to yes amen listen it's not just it's a requirement like these versions of requirement but God's already give us the plan everybody with me on that so male and female created he them but he couldn't put him in flesh yet he couldn't he could he could only anoint he'd take a piece of that because listen whatever Moses did we'll look at it right here David all these different ones these these hold on a minute these Heroes of Faith uh they're all all them are pretty much in Hebrews 11. which is the Hall of Fame of Faith right but they all have flaws they all had flaws without Moses had power to deliver the children of Israel but he didn't have the character of God or he wouldn't have killed that Egyptian he got so mad he killed that Egyptian so he became a murderer but yet God still would anoint him so much they'd have to look away from him because his face so much and whatever Moses said brother Brown said whatever Moses said that's what God did that he said flies flies came fleas fleas come amen so he had power but he didn't have the character to go with it there had to be one that was holding the character David would not have been a murderer and an adulterer but he was anointed for the kingship remember the time that he when he went to Bathsheba he was already King Samuel had already anointed him remember Samuel goes and there's there's seven sons there you know and he looks at each one he doesn't see he doesn't feel any anointing he said hey God sent me here have you got another one around here somewhere he said oh man I got this little my my baby my least one he's around there he smells like sheep we probably need to wash him before he comes in you know because all those other brothers the Bible said were you know there were you know a Men of War because remember they got on David's skin when David went into the camp they're like assistant get out of here right what are you here for well he was there because he was anointed and that anointing didn't come off of him but remember he was a murderer and he was an adulterer Samson he had a Nazarite foul God anointed him so much to like like somebody said the other day he wasn't this big Samson this great big Arnold Schwarzenegger looking thing he was you know he looked like Ryan Maybe skinny pale praise the Lord praise the Lord anyway we love Ryan you know that but he's about the skinniest one in the building he needs to eat born is a so but Samson was that was the Marvel why do you think they were trying to track him down and find out where his power came from but remember he had power but no character to go with it because the character he had was he was a womanizer and he let a woman take him down he was disobedient to that Nazarite vow through a woman deceiving him all right Abraham what'd he do he gave his wife away twice laughed at God but yet God anointed him to be the father of our faith and by with me all right didn't have the Genesis 126 man if not then this character would have changed the character of the Old Testament would have changed if this would have been in him come on this Genesis 1 26 man this new birth this Holy Ghost inside of you not anointing you because remember you can be anointed by the pure baptism of the Holy Ghost and dying go to hell anointed but you can't have this inside your soul and be lost all right so Jacob shyster Tripper upper he was him and Laban back and forth with each other he just was not an honest guy but God loved Jacob but remember Jacob had to have a name change he had to be changed to Israel as a prince with God or a limping Prince but he had a flaw yeah Noah died or drunk great man remember in the beginning of Noah's life he walked with God yeah yeah right walk before me and be perfect Noah was what perfect in the eyes of God or or he lived right but look at the end of his life he died a drunk Saul wow Saul was the man of the hour he was like this real big basketball player looking thing taller than anybody else good looking guy but he didn't have it in his heart really to be a king because he turned everything down almost that Samuel told him he did the opposite then Nathan told him what to do he did the opposite he never was obedient to the word of God for the hour does that sound familiar so you see what you get you get a saw but now remember he was so anointed until he prophesied and David said touch not mine anointed listen Saul's going to be in heaven right as bad as we look at him in as bad as we look at all these they're going to be in heaven with eternal life yes living with us now we're going to have to talk to Saul a little bit longer or higher because he's up here but that's okay but he's going to be in heaven Elisha he must have had a pretty quick temper but he had an anointing remember it came off of Elijah and it fell on Elisha but it was power without character and they said hey old ball head and he turned around and he's and he cursed them and children were eat up by bears because of Elisha but he was anointed for the time amen I'm gonna do a sermon one day on anointed for the time because that's what that's we're anointed for the time too but those in the Old Testament were anointed for their time and the Bible tells them look it says they're examples they're examples for us we're not to act like David totally we're not to act like Esau I mean not Esau but Noah we're not to act like I'm totally we're to use pieces in their life yeah right correct examples but they didn't receive the promise according to Hebrews 11. we have a better thing we had this come and a man look God in flesh had to come to bring power with character think about that God had to come in human flesh that's why he could condescend to give us the character of God you know what to get this guy out to where he could be on display this is the display of God Adam and Eve was supposed to be the display of God that's what they were put there for in that Genesis 1 26 man was put inside of them to be at this play of the character of God but they messed it up God had to take that character back and just then I'll show a little peace in Noah a little piece in David a little piece and different ones that we've got listed here there's different ones different pieces but remember the whole piece showed up The Headstone showed up not just part truth not just an anointing but the man God and flesh had to come to bring power with character could brother Brown remember what he say power without character is satanic you're saying they act like Satan yeah they act like Satan's listen God don't God don't commit adultery God don't kill somebody out of malice like David did in the different ones that was the devil that anointed them to do those things because there was not this in their to keep them today you have this to keep you like I said before that spiritual Rudder the boat's still there you just received a Rudder amen that turns you away from those things where Moses I I think of Moses a lot of times because Moses is the one remember he was brought up from a baby told by his mama he was a deliverer remember brother around me tell us the whole story his mama God put his mama there to nurse him raise him up tell him who he was but now remember what was Moses's interpretation of that not white on God his interpretation of that was I got to do it now I think I'll take over I'm going to learn to be a military man he was shrewd I'm gonna learn to be the next guy to pharaoh cause see somewhere in that line he got adopted because remember he was next in line and he had what he had the people under him brother Ryan said he could have you could raise an army up and that was in his mentality but what he had power without character and that spilled over into him killing an Egyptian not waiting on the plan of God but killing an Egyptian and remember it took him 40 more years to get back to that same place that's right but he had something a little different he had an anointing he made a burning bush and when he met that burning bush God said I'll go with you oh I'll give you what you need it's time now but remember who cried out for the deliverer the people the people cried out for a deliverer Israel cried out for a deliverer look see God can condescend but Satan cannot Satan wants to be haughty high-minded lovers of pleasure more lovers of God we read about him all the time all right and he listen he is Anointed right right yeah he is the anointed cherub so God anointed him but he used the anointing wrong that's the only way I can explain to the devil because the Bible says through God's lips through a prophet says you are the and have been created the anointed chair you're the one that covereth you're the one that walketh up and down you're the one that does this you're the one who does that right he didn't have said he went self-anointed he was anointed by God but he chose to take that anointing and use it different to be his own person to have his own Army to have his own what his own group that's why he went to the angels he needed a little bit more power he couldn't get enough power in his own self he had to go out here and get a group and that's the way the devil is he really don't work by himself how many times brother Dale told you you don't stand alone right hey man if you sneak around on Weight Watchers and you go get you some ice cream somebody's got to be there with you sister Jim bless you and then they look at you and say we don't sin alone do we praise the Lord but you don't you don't listen you always affect somebody else think about it when you send your fact yourself but you always affect somebody else all right so think about that and that's the way Satan is let's just take that effect out of the way though let's bring power with character and it'll kind of turn us around as we're talking getting toward brotherly kindness because I I don't read it today I read it to you this afternoon the two greatest Commandments Jesus said if you look Jesus said if you can't do 10. you know what he was saying master what's the greatest of the Commandment oh it's surely it's Thou shalt not kill surely Thou shalt not stale surely it's this he said hold on man he said the two greatest Commandments what were they believe in one God with all your mind Soul and Spirit and love your neighbor as you love yourself and I'll read it tonight he said in those two Commandments hangs everything the law and the prophets everything hangs on you doing those two Commandments and the second one fits right in with brotherly kindness hey man we'll get to that maybe in a second but see the religious story of the day what did they say listen this was God a human flesh this was God that came the way the Old Testament said he would come that's right but what the religious story of the day say you give me God before you start talking to people about Holiness today and about godliness today they'll say you ain't a perfect name perfect I got these flaws and I can say I can cuss a little bit and I can do this a little bit Richard sent me a something he got behind a car only them can get behind a car that says I love Jesus but I cuss a little so he sends it to me and he said this is what you've been preaching them but the religious story We're not gonna have a standard above the world we're just going to live like them yeah and let's agree with the world but but but but but when we go to church uh well you know clean let's clean it off and get that cussing out of our mouth hmm but what if God and human flesh were standing there telling them everything about himself right right and what he's going to do to me and you what about today the religious order and today is going to do the same thing you can't be God because they don't know what the true New Birth is if you have the new birth today if you get born again in five seconds from right now truly get born again you're just as Eternal as God is you're just as perfect as God is you have no spot you have no wrinkle your robe is white yes amen instantly oh yeah we know it takes a process I didn't talk about justifications I just said if you get bored again today all right your walk continues up and you get born again today you have that person inside of you and the religious story of the day is going to say I can cuss a little and still be like God no if God don't cuss and for those of you that live up north if you're watching from Ohio cuss is Curse we just say cuss in the south because Granny always says quit cussing everybody all right but their related so their day's going to say the same thing about me and you but we have power with character they may have power sure they may be healing they may feel emotion they may feel the presence of God and be sitting there with short hair and a pair of shorts on praise God but it's just gonna be temporary right right because you're gonna go back to cussing again yes or whatever I just like cussing because that's what we've been talking about it's really strange to have say would you see somebody that would make something like that and put it on your car that's how bold people are I love Jesus but I cuss a little and I let the whole world know it y'all just on the back of my card if you get too close guess what I'm gonna prove that point I'm gonna cuss you out but the religious story of the day is going to do the same same me and you we sit here today and I was thinking about this morning all of you come to church and you we do the things of church right we we are we're Christians right and and we believe I hope we believe as a bride of Jesus Christ that we're it we're it there there's no other standard to live by except what me and you know right now everybody everybody with me it's not a Baptist standard you look at the Baptist now I was talking to Jeannie the other day the little girl that cuts her hair well the Methodist they're split because LGBT thing putting women in the pulpit and all that stuff and gays oh that's your business but thank God there's a group that come out could be foolish version in there all right now now that that Demon's done jumped over into the Baptist and now they're splitting because some of them are let women preach now Baptists are true Baptist I'm talking about a true bad distance Die Hard Baptist knows that a woman's not supposed to be in this bullpet called this biblical it's the Bible and that's what they built it and especially not deacons or Elders or nothing now thank God for the Baptist Church for holding on to that but remember now there's a group that's pulled out big church up here in Gainesville is letting women be us they have so many pastors they got pastors for this in the denominational world but I told Jenny she said now y'all don't believe in that I said no I said it don't take somebody to have to call me and tell me that either I don't have to get a less says either let them or don't I said Paul sent me a letter 2 000 years ago and praise God it didn't get hung up in the mail right right right he said every one of your pocket if you got a phone with a Bible on it that tells you plainly that a woman's not supposed to Ursa Penny Authority art and you know what women you ought to say praise God that's something you don't have to deal with what Jesus always say that's your summer ain't gonna worry about I may feel like I need to talk to the women or you know Like a Shepherd a group of people no I'm sorry it's not built that way we're not built to have kids you are yes so you're not built to be a pastor we are not trying to meddle but we know that we didn't come in this church to hear me give you some new doctrine that we don't believe women should be preachers Paul told us that was an old sermon that's two thousand years ago and that sermon is still there absolutely it's still in print that's what I told Jenny I said I ain't gonna have nobody send me a letter she said I think every people ought to be independent I said well where are you I didn't say that but I'd like to say that she's a good phenomenal Christian girl she just tries to live it as much as she can and Dad's talked to her a little bit and she just can't see that part but as far as a nominal Christian should go to church all the time she's just she works she works in the church does a lot of stuff but she knows her place too so she knows it doesn't matter you know I said well what about your pastor he's she said well he knows the difference did she not the woman's not supposed to preach or Usher paying the authority in church and she said we're good with that I said well now the church up here in Gainesville the big one up there they've allowed a woman to be a minister one of the Ministers of the church and that's another the southern baptist Union or whatever it is they're trying people are trying to pull away from that because of that because of a truth that they can't stand come on because it's the devil yes that's trying to give them power without character because the holy ghost-filled woman will never get In a Pulpit I only gonna feel a woman would never want to be a deacon yeah I only gonna feel woman will never want to urge her opinion Authority in a church I said a Holy Ghost and the holy ghost film know his place that's right in the church I don't know why that was free but anyway so let's look for a man brotherly kindness but it's the truth we don't have to sit here and worry whether our uh what they call them a convention if you go to a convention we're going to have a convention all right but it's going to be in the millennium we're gonna have a commission over there but we ain't got to go to a convention to figure out what we believe because it's in the Bible plainly in the Bible but you take these people like Joyce Meyers and all these different ones that are just out hugely famous and they just hang on every word for from the and she's her hair short is mine got fishing lures in there hanging over ears right Danny we seem we've seen pretty I've seen pretty efficient lures when I have some of the things they wear off I mean it just drags why would you do that because it's an anointing she's anointed she's yielded herself to a wrong anointing though sure it may be the Holy Ghost fighting her because she does read the Bible but it ain't annoying her to tell you you can cut your hair I tell you there's no way God can go against his word no ways we can put her we can put everything we have on that one thing he will never go against his word he'll never back up he'll never change it either wow but can't we just can't we just lay our lay our uh uh uh Solace on that then I don't have to go to church next Sunday and wonder whether somebody's told me that I need to let women in the pulpit or I need to let a gay or a lesbian lead my people we should be we should be ecstatic that we don't have to worry about now we've come under not just a message of the hour we come under the true Biblical word of God the true Biblical word of God where there is no and listen our sisters don't fight that listen the problem with them I say them the problem with that anointing or that that see they have an anointing of a Baptist a Baptist has an anointing Methodist has an anointing different ones they've used the word of God different ways all right we don't have uh there's not a sister I hope not sitting in this congregation this this going I sure would like to get up here because he is just so boring I I could I can say a lot better than he can well some of you are not even shaking your head some of you are like going to the chiropractor yeah I see it on Facebook anyway so but that Spirit had to pop his head up in a congregation that there is a woman sitting in the congregation that thinks that she can talk better than the guy standing in the pulpit right because that's where that come from that's where that motivation's coming from and if you don't have what now look if you don't have a strong Pastor or a strong person that stands back here to deliver the word of God guess what he's going to do well okay sister I'm thinking maybe you are a little bit more anointed than I am you step on up here and oh sister's gonna deliver the message today the only way a woman is going to stand in this pulpit is the Bride of Jesus Christ and that is it I'm talking about the male part but remember we're all female in the body but now see you say that and then everybody said well now we've done bro wait you throw it all in a pot and we all come out now don't change what Paul said absolutely it does not change what Paul said Paul said and we believe it anyway brother kindness just for about two minutes and besides this giving all Dylan just add to your faith version of virtual knowledge and all his Temperance we've been through all these tempers patience the patience godliness and godliness brotherly kindness and brother kindness charity we know that Philadelphia that means brother to love and as we were talking before it's not brotherly love that turns into lust all right it's not even Brotherly Love Ophelia love at the point of you loving your wife are you loving your kids and all that everybody got that so we have to differentiate that though all right so it's love of brothers or sisters in the New Testament it's the love which Christians cherish for each other as Brethren all right that kind of goes to show you just for a minute you look over in the in the Old Testament you see Sodom and Gomorrah that's where the word sodomy comes from because and all you adults know what happened in that City all right Sodom and Gomorrah Old Testament can't control their self that's what it is just an uncontrolled passion or lust now you come over though and you come to where Jesus comes and he give us the passion of him The Passion of Christ or the love of God the agape love all right so he set the standard that's right all right first three Church ages that standard held no water baptism in the name of father son Holy Ghost no eternal hell no Trinity that all held but they lost the Bible didn't say they lost their first Doctrine what'd he say you've lost your first love you've lost your first agape in other words you've lost Jesus Christ so now it got lost so much to look at the other end of the book in you got a Sodom and Gomorrah here again amen same thing you got a Sodom and Gomorrah right here again just like that Sodom and gomor that was over there and listen that's what brother Brown said God would have to raise up that Sodom and and and apologize if you don't destroy this one right but remember he's going to take us out he even took lot was the top of the what right nominal believer yes he went top of the Bride the bride was Abraham setting up on the hill that not didn't go down there but lot made it he had to write your soul that's what the Bible says but he got took out before the destruction so everybody with me on that so God is love but love typically produces obedience and that's what we're going to talk about tonight we'll close right here come on musicians come on let's all stand and for all who refuse to repent and believe in Christ you see well I just we love everybody that's the whole thing of the sanity in the nominal world is God is love and that's what the Bible says God is love but they put no correction in it they put Power in that scripture without the character to look and say but he is a just God he's not agrees he got he gives you Grace but he doesn't give you greasy Grace for all those who refuse to repent and believe in Christ they receive Justice for those who do trust in Christ they receive what they don't deserve and that's what it is Grace and have withheld what they really did deserve which is Mercy we need mercy and Grace which side are you on do you have eternal life or do you still have the wrath of God abiding I want to say in you not on you but in you without the Holy Ghost that's what you have amen let's sing a song Matthew 24 says a love of many shall last called I have heard thy life [Music] to me [Music] and be closer to me [Music] and Lord till the cross where thou has died [Music] [Applause] [Music] consecrate me now can I serve as Lord by the power of Grace let my soul of God with a steadfast hope and my will be lost [Music] never bless the Lord till the cross where thou has died [Music] all of your dead [Music] holy prayer I am with thee my God is [Music] [Music] draw me a mirror blessed Lord to thy precious bleeding Sun there are Gifts of
