don't see that's another part of our generation give everybody a trophy you ain't kidding you everybody a trophy anyway all right we got fathers day fishing trip coming up a phrase of 17th of the 19 please I've got down Jim so I guess we'll go in June this year June the 17th this water things they got me almost up June 17th through the 19th grief all right so we're going to to go state park if you don't have a packet and if you want one you need to see probably Bob and Leslie forgot it you can see him and we'll get you a packet show you where we're going what we're doing and for those of you that don't want to come and stay like I said before Monday night we're having a Lowcountry ball so if some of you would like to come and attend that would be just wonderful and also remember that mom's birthday thing will be right after communion so we'll go downstairs and we're finished and have a birthday party for her so revelation 6 verse 5 hope you're enjoying the seals that I share em I keep seeing things and staying sane we were downstairs and and like father like son I got a I found a frog this week mm-hmm and he settled in my throat so just pray for my voice but downstairs worth you know speaking about the book of Romans and you just see it fit right into the seals and you really I never really saw that before but you see it now that that if brother Brian said once seal could tie the entire Bible together you know - Pete some people that's a far-off thing I mean without an understanding you can't see that without an understanding you would call him a liar but it's not it's just truth because you look through the same eyes as the guy that wrote it if you see this through the same eyes of the guy that wrote it then guess what you'll be able to understand so revelation 6 verse 5 and we'll pray before we get started remember all these that are traveling I just talked brother Joe he's still in well he was in Texas a few hours ago he had had a flat tire last night he had to wait till this morning to fix it so he's running a little behind schedule but they're getting to New Mexico this afternoon late and gonna be there for a couple of weeks for for the meeting that we were gonna go to and then about a week later he's gonna stay again so remember brother Luis he's coming back on Tuesday or heading back home Tuesday keep sister Cristina in your prayer don't you be this lost parents you know what she's going through I have not yet so I don't know what she's going through you just have to pray for I just prayed the other day I said look God you knew it you knew how she would react and you know what to do to fix it so that's all I have to do just depend on God that he'll cuz I can't do it you can't do it you can you can pat somebody banks and know how you feel but but God knows how they feel the Holy Spirit knows exactly he knew how you felt before you even got here Amen so we just put our trust in that so let's bow our heads your father we pray today Lord that you would come among us in a special way Lord as we come through these seals we see now Lord that this is I believe the final push toward the end and this is Lord what it's going to have to take these things to get us where we need to be but father you saw that you knew that you put it in the word you put the ministry out there you gave us a prophet you gave us the Holy Ghost to understand so Lord we just need to yield to you father today we all need to yield ourselves to you order our whole body and mind and spirit Lord we pray this you would just take over and you do the work you do the revealing you do the preaching today father give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses it was a on the foreign fields Lord give them fruit for their labor be the ones are on the highways traveling both Joe and Him Lord give them safe travel where they're going brother Louie's safe travel back home we were the direct Lord they've done what they need to do them in Maryland now they're tying up some loose ends down here Lord we pray that you just be with each one blessed this day give us a stare daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen and we had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I'll be held in lo a black horse and he that sat on him a pair of balances in his hand I heard a voice in the midst before beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine has anybody caught what's missing and from one too what's missing in this one we'll talk about in just a second something very important is missing in this third seal you may be seizing the Lord has a blessing to the reading of the word something that we're really gonna have to look at the contrast because when you look at blag you wonder you know you take black and you go my blacks bad well we're going to read the Bible today at the very end and I'll pull some scriptures up where Paul that's all he's talking about is us being dead that's being dead because if we're alive then Christ can't live like Dwight Moody said you know God can fill those who are not full of ourselves so if we're dead you know Christ lives it's not eyelet living the Christ that liveth in me all right so let's begin let's look at our chart again we need to see show that it's Redemption Redemption Redemption we're showing that the breaking of the seal is not necessarily for the stole the soldiers were deemed by the new birth shed blood of Jesus constant Calvary now what do we work you know we're working on the now as God brought fellowship back the fellowship between Adam and God was lost because of his spiritual being his spirit realm not the soul didn't affect the soul listen listen that's why I want you to understand your soul if you're born again is your so protected your so protected because God can't hurt God it is God and that's what your soul is now by the baptism by the Holy Ghost by the new birth the one that come in you at your new birth is God the Creator the man himself that named every star that created what you're standing on and created you and when we run into problems and things in life and all the things that we go through that's not your soul remember brother Brown said your soul only feeds on the word now keep that in mind so your soul doesn't feed on all this peripheral things that we do in life okay you don't love your wife with your soul you love your wife you your spirit your feel your love because remember I got it love is only in the soul now listen I say only but it's got to work its way out because look that's not filial love now we start down here with filial love love of the Brethren love of the different things but when you get up to here that's why brotherly kindness brotherly kindness is not loving your brother will feel your love because you can't we're human beings some of you can't stand to be in the room with me some of y'all I can't stand being room with that's just where this that doesn't make us not Christians that's what brother Branham said need me to find the quote I find it where brother mom said you can't stand to be in the room with some people that's that outside guy memories and conscious facing imagination imagination but this brotherly kindness as they've been reading unfeigned love of the Brethren that's not common love all right so when we get to this seal I want you to watch what has happened because this thing got a part like the Red Sea you're quiet and that's okay because you don't know what I'm fixing to tell you this first seal in the second seal I'm gonna read them the Bible says power was given power was given go back to Revelation this is what I saw the other day really helped me to understand this seal better there's no power given in that seal there is a voice the voice of God that says whatever you're gonna do Satan that's fine but I am going to protect I am going to protect a group of people you can go off as far north as you want to go but you're gonna leave my oil and wine alone I'm not giving you any more power huh power was given power was given no power but now look on the other hand this is the problem that we're going to look at in a minute with specially with Cain now what's happened in this seal is is we got to these church ages and what's happened is Satan to need power from God he's got all the power in the people those denominational ideas that's why I was telling them downstairs physically killing someone it's not a problem but to spiritually kill somebody we were reading there in Romans where we actually got in the second chapter but in the first chapter of Romans he talks about covetous and idolaters and prostitutes and not the whole West you know how Paul lists those things down and then in then in Romans 2 he's talking about the same thing but he's not coming by physical he brings it to the spiritual part and says guys this is worse you're condemning the prostitute yeah you're prostituting yourself out to a denominational system in other words they weren't the denominator that was not a denominational system back in paul's age but there was a denominational spirit like brother branham's discerned the man going across the fore he said remember he said the guy was committing adultery he thought the brother now look he caught that from a spirit he didn't catch that from a vision let me make this point here because you make brother branham you know see something wrong he didn't catch that in the vision he caught that in the spiritual realm felt that spirit of adultery but remember he said God showed me when now when God showed him a vision he didn't show him the vision of the man in bed with another woman he's so division of this man what leanin the organized religion so that same spirit of adultery all the there in Romans 1 read the last I'm in all kind of old tale bears bla bla bla bla down through there say same devil a little different manifestation when it comes to the flesh that's why I tell you this flesh does not sin if you look on the woman to lust after her you've committed adultery already in your heart not in your body Jesus is bringing it up a little bit higher right so there in Romans we see that he's dealing with spirits well that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with spirits we're not dealing with people I told them this morning news thunderscope there's not a horse riding in your life it's the power it's a demon it's all those little imps all those little things that that you have problems with this satan sends these devils out but in this third seal God is dividing now look the only place God ever divides take everything we know and you break it down to two things filled with the Holy Ghost or not filled with you whatever you can preach for a hundred years you must be born again or you're not born again there's no halfway in between if you're in this group for this group now this group has divisions and Heights and depths this group has to you got the fullest version over here that's not in this group but yet they're virgins so you see you break it down though to two things you either got the Holy Ghost or you don't then you can play you know you can preach your levels and all different things so that's the same thing when we come to this third seal when then open and you say what you want to but I believe in its third seals where brother Bradley saw them grace a marriage and divorce I read it in a minute because you got to come down to where yeah he was preaching to people about physical marriage and divorce there's things we do in our body we must clear this out there aren't things that you do in your body you you can be forgiven but you can't be justified now that's a direct quote you'll be forgiven but you can't be justified okay and there are things that says in the Bible that if you do you can't do this so there's you see what I'm saying when I say this thing doesn't sin that doesn't mean that this thing can do what it wants to because look it don't do what it wants to do because Adam was in a flesh body walking around naked well and Georgia is naked walking around naked with Eve and there was no problem so where was the difference it was in his mind in his memory reason conscious defects an imagination right so we see we come to this seal here and God said alright I'm gonna divide this thing you can go off as far as you won't do this way but there's gonna be a group of people that you're not gonna be able to hurt while the only people he can't hurt or his own kids God can't hurt his own children so we see even in even in this dark blackness coming up that God has preserved a group of people and sent them over to the side because you know what once they come out of Nicaea and was killing the Christians and making them have the Roman doctrine and doing the novenas and and all that Catholicism you know so what did Satan do you got Catholicism you got Protestantism now this in itself is not exactly correct all they've done is just protested certain things that the Catholics did right so the pure word was not what was restored that's why like brother Dale says these are reformers [Music] they brought you from here over to here now what's happening now all Satan deines is okay in the end I'm gonna bring them all right back together again right and now what's gonna happen the Protestants and Catholics you heard that Tony Palmer several years ago he said you're protesting is over you know what he was telling them he was telling the group of people which were even Pentecostals that we believe same thing you do and ways that y'all believe same thing we do because the protesting was as Martin Luther was against the Catholic Church that's called projects they're protesting so what Satan done now God preserved a group of people through there but what happened was Satan just married them right back together again in the end time because that's what's gonna head up in the Beast the Beast system is working now but there's going to be a literal person that's going to be anointed by the devil incarnate devil that's going to bring this thing back together and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week who's that he that he's the Antichrist through the Pope and we put it all on the Pope but somebody's gotta agree remember somebody's gotta agree to go in so it's not just all the Pope's fault somebody's gotta agree to go back somebody's gotta agree to knock all this down and come back together like Oh Satan's bringing them together but he'll never listen Satan will never take the bride off like that hurt not the oil and the wine hurt not the oil and the wine now let's get one because we've already read it before because remember we're looking at the mystery that is hid underneath the seal not the seal itself we know that seal is we got to break in the seals we're going to see it goes plumb back in the scripture we're going to see that today we're going to go back to Genesis for free for those fields the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals steam every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time I'll prove it just in a minute notice the book remember is sealed here's one here's their seal another one's wrapped around the seal the other one's wrapped it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals and it begins on the backside skull just wound up we showed that the steal mystery is on the inside so we're looking what's on the inside we're not looking at just white red and black we know what these manifestations are but remember it's a contrast to what God's already do it even in that blackness that black horse God is protecting a group of people I mean he's protecting somebody why because the words got to get through them ages even if it's just a shoot or a stalk or whatever you want to say it's got to get through those ages because mm-hmm the Bible says enjoy restore what has been eat down what down to here now we know this is not the seed but its Bluff to shoot stock and then the tassel with the Pentecostals and then the full wheat back to maturity alright excuse me being us on the backside so just wound up the steel mysteries on the inside and only since white horse or black horse and whatever on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in them seals from Genesis to Revelation a complete plan of redemption is revealed in those seven seals Orson important time God help us now the seal we just were talking about that let's go to the seal they don't want to show you something here in just a second we had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see behold a little black horse he's our senator Mayer Powell bounces in his hand what is balanced is for balance is this for weight measurement even when you go to the court who's standing outside Miss Justice you wonder why it's a woman you wonder why some woman the bride the bride the bride's the judge the bride's listen we're going judge the whole work so you see the woman standing out there with the blindfold with the thing around her head what she got in her hand a pair of balances right right so man is testifying what's going to happen when the great judge comes when the great Justice happens it's going to be God's not going to say I said he's gonna say I had a group of people that walked among you that you shunned like I was telling them downstairs that's what we were talking about spirit God's not gonna come to the great white throne judgment and he's not going to have a list of things you did bad he doesn't have to ice Weis it there's only one thing on the list you either accepted me or you didn't other than that any of that that goes down through there you list a million things doesn't matter one thing he's gonna say I came to you on June the 4th not 2018 and I called your name I asked you I put somebody in your path you heard a preacher on the radio and you turned me down at that moment you know what that person is gonna stand there because that's the only person that knows what's going on he's gonna have to say yes that's exactly what happened now God's not gonna say well then you were an adulterer and you were a liar and your thief and you know u-turn god damn right so you get here's your judgment why the Bible says you'll be judged by your works if you're not born again you're gonna be judged by your words what did you accept him or did you not but a pair of balances in his hand but now look see what I'm saying when you come to this you see the symbolism of the just of the judge with the balances in her hand and who's the only person who judges if you have the Holy Ghost that is the judge if you don't have the Holy Ghost you will be judged so it's the judge and the judge okay so state we come down so I said that third seal is very important because it's gonna show you it's gonna narrow down and you got to figure out what group you're in no wiggle room here you're gonna have to figure out what group you're in and then you're gonna have to go that way remember what brother Brown said he said wherever you left God that's where you gotta come back to if the guns off you got to come back with that scope and you got to make the adjustment back here cuz this is where you got off and then so the people did they got off and they went to the blackness of denomination but out of that God protected a group of people that's going to judge the world now we know for a fact sure the the measure wheat for a penny and three measures of the barley for a penny we know that was the charging for novenas and now we say well that's Catholic Church let's get a little closer to home what about a preacher in this message preaching false doctrine and his group of people are paying his salary all that hurts look we're either gonna be 100% right somebody is are you wrong if one word got us out of the garden Eve then one word off its gonna keep us out of the garden Eve but God said I will restore what not-not-not I'm not going to restore back to Genesis for collapse wins Adam even Cain and Abel all came into being when all them spirits started happening no he's going to restore back what Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before the fall and then that's I will restore not I will prop up Satan to prop up but God restores back I believe for a moment we'll have an Eden here just like there was when Adam and Eve was on the earth and God can come down and not just speak with them but speak in them a major wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and wine now that voice is not one of the four beasts now going up grow it up please I am sorry but I noticed - now remember stop praying like I said before power was given in the other two seals there's no power given in this seal to me the powers in the revelation of what that seal all right keep going up now third seal notice here's the good part now see thou hurt not this oil and wine just a little bit of it left brother don't you touch that now all it symbolizes the spirit the holy spirit I just want to read you what brother Brown said I'll give you a few verses if you want to in Leviticus 8:12 or Aaron before he went in to be anointed with all you know had to be anointed with all that ground 4:12 of oil coming pouring through the pipes and saying this is my spirit oil you know what you stub out the candlestick all right pouring the oil in another thing if you want to see Matthew 1425 there was a foolish virgin the foolish virgin had no oil no spirit because here we go down to two things again the spirit field and to not spare Phil okay now what we're going to get to right now we're we're gonna have an old moment is that there's a stimulation that goes with that now oil typifies spirit and wine simulates temp symbolizes stimulation of Revelation boy I like to run all over the place now look God was revealing this to brother Branham and he was about to run all over the place it's a wonder I didn't wake up the neighborhood and we sit here asleep listen it's a problem is y'all don't have stimulation you may have the Holy Ghost but you gotta have say you gotta have something that says well you're not singing this fine we can stand up wing sing and we can do this wing to this but when the preacher preaches you do this what are you praising Satan can come right in and give you a spirit to worship all you want to but he cannot give you a stimulation of Revelation that's something Satan that's why that that he's protected that oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always that's why it's brother Dale's preaching on the Holy Spirit you'll get a stimulation you may not run all over the place it's whatever you were born under it you know I some people do run and shout that's okay some people can't control herself some people can you know it's okay but what are you doing with it you see people shout and praise God worship and they come here about once every two weeks three weeks miss this service miss that you proven you don't have the real stimulation you may have the stimulation of something because memory reason conscious affects an imagination you can be stimulated but there's only one thing that can stimulate your soul and that's God that's the revelation that God gives you amen I swapped it when I saw that about the Bears in divorce yeah I didn't get up and run around the you know the pecan tree but it was a stimulation inside of me to cyst yeah that's what that is you know that you just say yeah thank you Lord that's what that is that's what all of you want you say yeah that's what that is stimulates in Revelation all the wine in the Bible is associated together always I got the concordance and look and there's a string of them that like that there's wine and oil going together all the time not let's go to the next one yeah bye all right say man all right cuz we fixing go to Land of Nod in a minute some of you have already went there we're going to the Bible to the Land of Nod so don't worry we're gonna do that then what does it say to this rider in black don't hurt my wine in my oil don't you touch it now that's bro Graham said that voice was the lamb so that was the Redeemer telling Satan you will not bother this group of people now sure you may bother but what I mean is you're not gonna send them off into hell no I'm gonna protect this group of people now I've got just a little bit of it down there but there's still a little there yes sir like brother Brown said Martin Luther had a dip for the Holy Ghost when I hate people I did for the Holy Ghost brother right I did for the Holy Ghost that's all right go that's the divine nature of God amen a dip or to get you stimulated now you can go on through and measure out all that kind of life that you're putting out that's up to you you're gonna pay for it down there but when you come across that wine and all you leave it alone man what a protector we have look in other words if you catch some of my little flock that's filled with my oil and wine wine and all the pure word and you're gonna kill them because you're doing that that's what you're doing don't you force them to say any Hail Marys or do anything like that or some of your Creed's even the ones that come through these this dark time that's what I was thinking about God knew that they would accept Father Son Holy Ghost baptism God knew they would accept these Trinitarian ideas but he held true that they were what Christian people you keep your hands off of them they know where they're going for they are anointed with my oil and by being anointing with my oil they have the wine of joy because they know my word of promise Martin Luther the just shall live by faith he was so happy with that he changed the world what if he had all this other what if he'd be sitting here today and listen for a few hours I bet you even be asleep he'd be sitting on the edge of that seat going tell me some more because you know what I'm just piling on that little bit that I got I got a little bit more I got a little bit more I got a little bit more I'm gonna raise them up again don't hurt that don't go trying to messing them up messing them up just keep away from them so God is protecting a group of people coming out of the Dark Age he's protecting a group of people because he knows God knows for sure that it's not going to come back around and it's fullness until today that just methods gonna cost you put them all together they're still here they're all in church now we're fixing to go right God knew that but there's a group he says you don't mess with these people right these people will hold the truth regardless of what anybody says that all right say man just keep away from them so now let's go the next the third seal truly is very important you see that or maybe you don't see it can you say man that third seal is important there's no power there then he has to give Satan well Satan is gonna ride off on his group but God's got a grip he's going to protect we've got the power in what in the name of Jesus it's protected by the Lamb I will restore not reform right all right now what happened we go back to Genesis and we know what happened let's go to Genesis 4 because we know we can tile the Bible together with the seals right am i all right saying man yeah cuz we face a goal and God where some of you are now but in Genesis look don't you see what's going on remember spirits not people spirits not people I'm gonna say it one more time spirits not people because in Genesis 2 Genesis 3 what happened between Adam or between even the beasts and then brought out a man that was all by spirit if I got that same am Satan walked in the guard and anointed Eve all right but in genesis 3:15 what god say i will restore he just say that brother Wade well yay did if you'll read genesis 3:15 like I do I'll put enmity between what thy seed and the seed of the woman in other words brother Branham said he'll he promised he'd bring it back together and defeat Satan by that woman seed amen look so there's you promise but now watch this is the manifestation this is the sealed opening up in the book of Genesis not to steal literal this sealed spiritual the spirits were always there used to know what to name him because remember when we get to the fourth seal now we say well this guy's a murderer from the beginning he's death when he started even as a white horse Satan's death but in the fourth seal we become so so much stimulation of Revelation that we're able to know who is and call him by name see once you call somebody by name you've identified who they are and where they are the problem is is when we don't know where he is because he's slick and Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain said I've gotten a man from the Lord I got used my notes in my Bible now I didn't want to write them all down ain't one round like now where's Bob I thought bobby was gonna sell in front row today I guess he's not not gonna get spit on now the first thing he says is I've gotten a man from the Lord she's getting ready to you know we don't see this but you see that that that becomes a doctrine that becomes a doctrine cuz of people now in this day when you talk to them about the what happened in the garden the first thing they bring up they say oh he said I got a man well she did but that's not what we're talking about so what's a new he just all Satan has to do is just diverts your attention and he's got you like I've always said you know you you see the the man sitting on the fence you always got fence sitters lot of you you got fence sitters I'll just sit on this fence and I'll be so close to it if things get bad I'll fall over in the Christian side so Satan walks up one day and said what are you doing sitting on the fence he said well I don't know I don't really know about going on this side I trim my hair a little bit I don't come to church when I don't feel good blow Satan says well you know I own that fence don't you he'll get it in law you're already on his ground he's just got you food I thought we were supposed to flee from the appearance of evil shunning the appearance of evil flee from all these not settling the fence and she again Bears brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but came with the tiller of the ground now watch now watch what happened and in the process of time in other words it's not just a one moment thing they're getting older and you know what they're talking to each other Cain has an idea and Abel has an idea at that point in time they're talking all right is everybody okay with that they're talking and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain started bringing the fruit of his doctrine that okay gangs started bringing I want you to watch now don't put Cain and they're put spirit and that spirit don't die Cain's in the ground somewhere dead but that spirit still here in this room today and in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought through the ground an offering unto the Lord now who do you bring it to the devil no he knew to come to church brother Brown said he built an altar at the wall comes remember they were driven out he said came built an altar against the wall Abel booth announced her against the wall it wasn't he came went off and started making wine and started drinking and having affairs she I'm saying it's just a doctrine and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock look at the difference and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but into Cain and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very forgiving and he said please will you forgive me oh that's not ways then right Cain was very mad and he couldn't even hide it his countenance fell watch how these spears no watch now watch the Lord and the Lord look at that capital LRD that wasn't a bishop talking to Adam talking to Cain that was the Lord capital L Ord spoke directly to Cain and said why are you Roth now look you said why did God ask him that he already knew the problem he's got to get a confession he's got to get a confession and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen now watch can you see though that this white righteous church that we're talking about there's Cain taking his offering to God in church the fruit of his doctrine same thing with the first seal white righteous church cane Hey look can't look good to a point if you were looking at an outsider you would look at cane and he probably had or just a hundred different colors and he probably had them all set up just right then beautiful orange and red and yelling and then look over here a lamb with his tongue hanging out and Abel wakes his throat blood probably splatters against the wall and dill and the poor things you know and and you look at that and you're writing a comment and you said when I mr. Cain's doctrine looks a lot better than mr. Abel amen but it was totally opposite that's why that when you go over to the Book of Revelations he talked about spirits not dying you go over the Book of Revelations John saw the and he admired her brother Branham said in other words brother Ram said that angel had to divert his attention away from that beautiful church same doctrine same thing from Cain same spirit if thou do as well though remember there was a white righteous church on the earth at the time Abel was right and what he done and what God was trying to do was get came to convert he was looking for a conversion a confession if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin life that's your door anthems these shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him knowing that that things fixing to take over Cain totally take over Cain now watch now there's your white horse the white horse was two white righteous but one seeming white righteous and one is what righteous Abel was righteous you go to you go to Hebrews 11 it says righteous Abel cannot but now what happened watch when this watch when the second seal open and Cain talked with Abel now what they talked about what was on sale at Walmart they talked about what just happened why did God accept your sacrifice well they started talking and what DK knew Cain killed Abel because of a doctrine what was the second seal read remember he rode through that church and killed the people Cain talked with Abel his brother and he came to pass now what happened was there must have been several conversations this is not just like brother Dale said you can't read this and think this was that happened in a moment Cody said and it came to pass which could be any length of time when they were in the field so they wherever they were talking they had to go in the field that Cain rose up now wide it came kill Abel because of his doctrine not because it was his brother not because of the doctrine they were talking about they could not agree so Cain something rose up in Cain and he slew Abel same way with here everybody all right say man cuz what and the Lord said unto Cain now hello our day here the Lord comes back down again and said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother you say well he knew were it sure did he wants a confession he's gotta have a confession and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother that's why I'm telling you we talked about these seals and we talked about the statue a perfect man God wants a confession I'm in the message that's not a confession a confession is as I understand and I am stimulated by what God brings me because of this message hey man the Lord said to Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not well you liar am I my brother's keeper now boy there's a lot of repentance in that cuz you see what Cain's doing he's he's going further away from God you know what God's going with him God's walking with him all the way down here the Lord still with Cain he's right there with Cain he's right there with anybody walking through these ages trying to get them to turn but there'll be a point where you can't turn or when you make your turn you can't get back okay excuse me the Lord syndicating where's Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I my brother's keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice there's no blood has a voice but the life that was in that blade was the voice you know what happened Abel was in another dimension he actually was there with God I believe right there not not in the sixth dimension but he was there he had to go somewhere he wasn't on the earth he was dead the voice of my brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground Satan says look or Cain says look the brother Bram says when he gets on my brother and my brother's keeper brother Brown said he says God take it or leave it what'd he say his confession was is I'm done with whatever you try to say to me that's the same thing let's see what this baby form they weren't called denominations until you get right here so those of you can't see right here these are not denominations but that same spirits working all way through that same spirit to put Jesus on the cross is still here today and now art thou cursed God finally said this is enough now art thou cursed from the earth which opened up her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand when thou tillest the ground it showing up and forth yield you know what he's talking about in other words came whatever doctrine comes out of this it's not gonna yield any fruit it's a denominational Creed or a denominational idea and it's not gonna yield my fruit well now tell us the ground it show not him forth yielding to thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth and Cain said unto the Lord forgive me Lord no he didn't he said my punishment is greater than I can bear he's looking for sympathy he ain't gonna get it be old thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I should be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth he just read quote when God said and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me now watch what God did God said hang on just a minute and the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him 7 fold so in other words God is going to allow through seven church ages that doctrine of Cain is going to go all the way through come there's no way that God comes remember God said I will restore so something had to go down so that God can restore it back amen vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold in other words in seven search agent it's gonna take seven Church ages to get rid of that doctrine cuz that's what we're dealing with today we're dealing with the doctrine of Cain you can call it whatever you want to and then and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him alright so there's your black horse the man anointing God's telling Kane I'm not gonna kill you sure he died physically but spiritually down through the church ages now what Mark did he put on Kane here's what they asked brother branham is this where the black people came from that's about pitiful to ask that question right but what mark was it brother James Colley what mark was it is the mark of the beast cuz remember somebody asked that question and the ministers meeting or something and you remember you just read it it's been 30 years ago you probably don't even remember that big way that's part of the curse brother Colley I'm sorry but daddy's told a story several times about brother Colley just read that so much so my acid or watch the market was put on Cain brother Brown said it was a market beef well what is the mark of the beast anything against God anything against the doctrine of God is the mark of the beast now Cain's problem was is right here and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and went to the Land of Nod and never returned to God amen is that our problem because you don't want to get out of the presence of God you want to get into the presence of God you get into the Shekinah glory of God and I'll promise you if Cain would have repented I'm not joking people if Cain would have repented God would have accepted his repentance but when he got to right there that mark did he put on Cain that was it he was done you know why he rejected what God was giving him it's like I said before God's not gonna send you to hell for being a liar cheat thief he's gonna send people to hell for what turning the word down and Cain went out from the presence of the Lord so we got to this seal here we'll finish up here in a few minutes just been going right into that one let's go to job 1224 but now you see how that spirit now look don't look at people look at spirits that motivate people like I read to y'all before the other day couple Sundays ago brother Brown said I'm not against you people I'm against that denomination that you're in now what that denomination did is give them a spirit and it wasn't the Holy Spirit brother Brown I'll read it to you next Sunday well just pull up dead domination and read her brother Ram said about it that's what it was Cain started a dead denomination he said that's been six thousand years ago people been like living yeah they're living but they're dead joke 1224 listen he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth no as soon as this Satan excuse me and causes them to wondering they wilderness where there is no way go talk to somebody in two denominations right now I've talked to two or three and they're just so done Jim talked to some sister some girl came in the store the other day I said she's done with denominations she want to know what we believe Jim said then you know give her a little bit of why we do what we do and what the Bible says about it not that brother Branham said that woman didn't care what brother Branham said didn't care that she didn't care that was a prophet here if she comes in so you'll learn that but she was tired she's I've been here I've been you look at the people they just they're all there wandering around in the wilderness they know we're getting close to the end time they grope in the dark because remember the foolish virgin they feel something happening and they jump right in there and said we want some oil they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man that's what that spirit of cane will give you all right Luke 11:30 for the light of the body is the eye therefore when that I be saying is single thy whole body also is full of light but when deny is evil the body is also full of darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness first Timothy five six and I'll make a comment about that in a second first Timothy 5 6 but she now what is this she she is a church a woman the she is that everybody agrees a man even those who either sleep salmon ok I'm crying wake up dead people but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth if that light in you be darkness how great is that darkness you know what the problem is you think it's like you hold it as light but it's darkness that's why this Black Horse caused those denominations to go the way they went that's the worst black you'll ever get is to think you're right in your own right look what's this revelations 3-1 this is exactly the fifth church age right to start easing Church AIDS and to the angel of the church in sardis because look we're typing it with the two ages here Sardis and Philadelphia and then you got loud to see yeah we're right in here is where in Sardis Ian in Philadelphia Church ages it's when all the denominations began to name themself Baptist Methodist Pentecostal whatever and the angel of the church in Sardis nays right into the church in Sardis these things says he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead Wow they'll have a name that they'll live is and art dead what will we take father son holy go will we take a Trinitarian doctor a name that they'll live in our dead Baptist Methodist Pentecostal now randomized if you want to make your own denomination but that's what happened mm-hmm if that lie didn't you be darkness how great is that darkness but God said he said I will restore and I'm gonna bring something back cuz watch here we now let's go to the flip side and we'll finish well we may not and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision to no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead now the Son of man didn't physically die right son of man did physically God the Son of man died one time at Calvary for all of us but what did they do they buried him in the Dark Ages they buried him under denominational idea mm-hmm a man called the son of man is the sort of the see the son of man is what promise come back in the end time amen until the Son of man be risen again from the dead what those dead denominations there's people coming out of them broke ready Wednesday night the dead denomination's there's people coming out what a wait how they sleep aren't gonna read that buy took it out because you already ready and here's the sample asked him saying why then shall the Scott say the sky that'll last much first come they know I just got to come remember I preached a long time ago about the five cups of a larger every year in Israel they sit down in a meal and they put a cup they fill it full of wine and they get ready to have a meal they walk out the door they look down the street that's away and down the street that way they're looking for Elijah and if he don't show up they just say until next year go back inside take the cup empty it and put it back on the shelf now they do that now they know Elijah could see when that fifth coming of Elijah comes they'll know who he is 144,000 to know who he is but see the forthcoming of Elijah is what they missed but we get them all we understand every one of them and jesus answered and said i let me last truly shall first come and restore all things now look John the Baptist did not do that it was to all things his message was the kingdom of heaven his hand but brother Branham that Elisha that spirit of Elijah all William Branham that was his promise to come back in restore the faith and the father's back so he's telling us right there but the Son of man has got to be risen again from the dead not physically dead like I said before one more time I've gotta be physically dead then spiritually dead if I'm physically dead with the Holy Ghost I'm not dead I'll prove it to you in a minute Romans 6 verse 1 mm-hmm this is our water baptism scripture every time we do a baptism we read the scripture why call this a death a burial and resurrection and then what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound Paul well you don't pout god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin look at the protection we're dead to sin if you're born to get in your soul it don't see in let's say something to me the other day she said when we really realize what we got inside levels that I I let her preach for a couple hours all that yeah I mean really say that our soul is gone have I sinned my day of grace away if you're born again no you may have problems in your spirit realm but greater is He that is in me how shall we that are dead to sin whoa Paul what mercy let's see dead unbelief your soul does not disbelieve how can God just believe itself right no you're not I can't get too excited sorry I'm gonna be finished with this in a few days no you're not there's so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together because the Bible says we plant them in corruption that's what you do when you go outside what do you do when we go to the funeral you just plant in the body you plant you're putting the earth back into Earth there's not a soul there there's not a spirit that you're planting the you're planting what came out of the earth back in there but if you're born again Dayton same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead come back and get that body clicking that mortal body bring it back up Bible says we plant them in corruption we raise them in in corruption well the Bible's perfect if we have been planted whether in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified now Jesus died on the cross his flesh body died our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed they him forth we should not serve sin for he that is dead it's free from sin our problem is is maybe we're not all dead maybe just we went through a divorce we didn't like our husband for a while so we separated from here but if these dads that's why I said about marriage and divorce watch this you keep going through mayors in divorce I'll get to it a minute oh no I'll get to it next Sunday because the Lord showed me something about that too knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more look if we be dead with Christ now Paul's alive physically alive at this moment but he's dead in Christ that's why the Bible says we'll read in it when the dead in Christ shall rise first they're not dead in the ground they died Christ while they were still alive now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more death hath no more dominion over him for him that he died he died unto sin once but and that he liveth he liveth unto God I know summing up Paul likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed under sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord then we baptized them amen I love that scripture for a baptismal scripture let's go and read Romans 7 we got about five more minutes only 3:30 mm-hmm no you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law and for those of you that don't go downstairs for the Sunday School class rodell's talked about interpolating you see what Paul was doing you see the parentheses just to give you a little something extra I'm not gonna charge you for this for I speak to them that know the law that's interpolating because really reading it like this you read no you're not brethren how that the law have to mean over man as long as he liveth what poles doing is the Holy Spirit stopping in and said hey explain this a little bit further because you're talking real plain but let's insert this now I didn't say interpreting I said interpolating this would be different for I speak to them that know the law all right so now we know who something up how that the law had to mean over men as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth now look we're talking about dance we tell my black we're coming my dad but if the husband be dead you say physical husband you can say whatever you want say because that's our problem you give him you give Satan the belly a writing of divorcement he's still there amen he's still there that's just like and I'm gonna be playing some of you that have living wives that you've divorced in whatever you know that's marriage and divorce you decide that all yourself but I like what brother Jess Trammell said he said the Bible says a double minded man is unstable he said I say a double married man it's unstable you know why that's not saying anything wrong what I'm saying is you always got that living something that you lookin back to you got a connection with you man I'm talking in your humanity you hear me in your humanity you do have a living life I don't care if you think she's dead if she's breathing this sucking air she's alive or him so you've always got that that will bother you and you'll lean toward same thing I'm talking about spiritual now if Satan is not dead in your soul he's alive and he'll always bother you but you can't divorce if your husband is dead she loose from the law hallelujah that's what God came to do he didn't come to divorce the mighty conquer came to kill your husband so he can marry you you don't married to Christ if you got a new birthing you soul you're married across all right that okay listen whatever we're not here to preach marriage in divorce but you see where I think brother branham got that cuz he said marriage and divorce was revealed in the field and that right if the old husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband do you know if if your husband has passed away you're just as free to marry as a virgin what the Bible said hey man this is you okay not a problem none it's all done that's why with Christ if we'll understand that then for our old husband is dead why do we want to resurrect him he's dead you're loosed we just read that you're loose from that responsibility of that first life you had how it's God if not divorce it's not over here somewhere oh you're on your mind but it's not over here where it can be accounted against you it's gone we've seen that so my sins are gone do we really believe it so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man I'm just reading you the Bible she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so she is no adulteress and she no marry another man now remember only in the Lord if you're Christian only in the Lord can't just go marry any other man you won't thing okay I told you I'm not preaching marriage and divorce but I believe that's where brother Branham saw that show me anywhere else that he come out wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ now who is he he's your husband that he should be married to another even to him who is raised from the den don't we tell Matt new in us Jesus Christ that we should bring forth fruit unto God from when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held think about what held these people what killed these people why are they waiting on us why because they're physically dead they're not spiritually dead if they're born again they're waiting oh me and you but there's untold millions and especially dead that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldest of the letter Jesus Christ our Lord amen let's read a few morning's stand to your feet start with commune let's go ahead and stand Colossians 3 verse 32 look set your affections on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead yea ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God 1st Thessalonians 4:15 very familiar for this we say unto you by the word the Lord that we which are alive and remain say that would mean that we boy y'all are so weak that way I can't say it can you say we thank you we what you're alive cuz that's what you are right now if you ever found yourself in the scripture right there you are today right there that we which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep which are what asleep not dead for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of the Archangel Trump of guards what you listening to now and the dead in Christ shall rise first one more second Timothy 2 verse 11 it is a faithful saying put this on your refrigerator for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him god bless you let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father thank you for today Lord now we come to the time of communion Lord if they be anyone too sick or in need of anything Lord we pray that as we take this communion we've seen with our own eyes people healed taking communion Lord and I pray that you will the healing power of that as we've been talking about the wine excuse me the wine and the oil the oil being the Holy Ghost but today we're going to particular wine which is the stimulation we pray today that the Word of God has stimulated something in our heart that we'll study just a little bit more that we'll know that our whole husband is dead that we are not bound by the law we're not bound by what we were born with oh praise the Lord we're not bound by that but we're bound to you Lord because we're married to you now our old husband's dead and now being dead in Christ we shall rise first Lord many of us died a long time ago lord I pray for anybody here today that it's too much alive that Lord that you would kill him kill that old nature Lord that they were born with lord help us to get rid of some of the some of the things that bothers even in life Lord in our spirit realm that you'll get rid of those and I think that's what's happening now that we've come out and out of the spirit realm where we have memories and conscious effects and imagination we have demons that are trying to get into those places Lord I pray that as you said in this third seal hurting out the other one Lord they'd be a protective barrier around each one it's a fire of God there's a wall of fire as a song as the lily of the valley I love that song there's a wall of fire around me and nothing out of fear when it's the fire of God we're not afraid of the fire of God the fire of God is what we live by father just give us today now as we continue on our daily bread forgive us of our sins Lord as we come to this time of cleansing of taking the communion that we clear our minds and our hearts that should forgive us of all the wrongdoings that we've done Lord thoughts that are against you and the things that we do that's not pleasing to you Lord in our in our spirit realm Lord we pray that you just be with us now and cleanse us sanctifies for this journey Lord in Jesus name we pray amen just remember that black horse there was no power cuz either the power was in the man either the power was in the man or you've got the power of God one of the two there's two power there's only two powers there's not four or five there's the power of God and there's a pile of the devil and the power that the Devils got he had to gotta give to him actually Bob we the ones that give it to him right we give him the arrows to shoot us with because he can't hurt us with a bow all right god bless you y'all have a good week cuz I believe it don't you God's Word is true all forever let's go over into the time of the communion as we do let's just have a few moments of silent prayer waiting on the Lord and just praying one for the other before we go on into the reading of the scriptures and thing and get our hearts tired before the Lord other we thank you for the grace of your love that you've bestowed upon us that your word would have the answer to all of our questions thank you for your godly guiding and your leading of us in our understanding and just have your way now we ask you to come and Lord as we change a little salton to go into the communion and foot washing and Lord that you'd prepare our hearts for these things and that you cleanse us all from run righteousness and make us to be the right partaker in you we love you we thank you in Jesus name Amen let's go to first Corinthians 11:23 we have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for that you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup where he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep where we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we're chasing to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home and you come out together into condemnation the rest will have said in order when I what a solemn time what an opportunity that we can come to a place to where we can participate take a part in this part of it's been going on for 2,000 years we call it the communion thank God for the truth of his word let's just own through it in the communion said he took bread and blessed it father we ask you to just press this bread as we Lord father partake of it we come to a point of realizing that we know it's not the blood it's not the body and all those things that we do today but we know for sure did it representative we just ask you to help us Lord that you sanctify this bread in that way you would sanctify the partakers that we may all be together is warning you this forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace and your love is sufficient for all times in Jesus name we won't we don't understand in this world and it's hard to comprehend the different things that God has done for us and all did you know what there'll be a date and we'll have an opportunity to be able to just maybe sit down for a little while and let him explain it together I'm looking forward today I've always that I've never never thought that you know that we'd go up there I just sit down and play harps cuz I'm not too good at musical instruments so I'd be having a lot of trouble but I just sit down with the Lord for a little while and just get an opportunity to be able to fellowship around the things that we did not understand and do not understand and will not understand why we're here in this world but we'll bring it to a place that will have an understanding about what these things mean why done this I've done that the Prophet one day preaching the message you know talking about the two loaves of bread and he said that that rabbi he said he'd never seen what's that mean there's times in God's Word it's going to be a wonderful opportunity father we thank you for this one and it's going through the process now and Lord and we protect our vision represents your blood for each and every one of us we know physically really eat them you piece of bread will drink a little wine it'll turn into blood cells in our body for us to grow by but we prayed that you would help us to grow by you and the opening of your word the understanding to where our hearts and our lives and come together in you and grow in you we love you and we thank you God each and every one of us in Jesus name you
