[25:03] kind of do a little teaching sermon this
[25:05] morning
[25:07] let's go to the lord in prayer before we
[25:09] look into the word we thank you god for
[25:11] your presence this morning lord thank
[25:13] you for the songs and the psalms that
[25:15] were read lord jesus we thank you god
[25:17] for all that you've given to us lord
[25:19] jesus and we lord we thank you god for
[25:21] working things in continuity lord the
[25:23] things that we're saying and the songs
[25:24] and the thoughts that have already been
[25:26] said lord jesus or write in continuity
[25:28] with the message this morning lord
[25:30] lord god there might be trouble all
[25:32] around lord jesus but god you've given
[25:33] us a comfort lord in this hour that we
[25:35] can look to your word and look to you
[25:37] lord jesus for something that passes all
[25:39] understanding
[25:40] lord god we may lord we can open up the
[25:43] bible with our physical strength lord
[25:45] but now we ask lord that you'll open up
[25:46] our understanding that we're able to
[25:48] look into the word and
[25:50] and perceive lord jesus what you would
[25:52] have us to know in this hour little god
[25:53] and we pray lord that you'll feel
[25:55] welcome to move among us lord this
[25:57] morning lord jesus said that this just
[25:58] won't just be like a a formal service
[26:01] lord but but hearts will be united to
[26:03] you lord god and you can feel a liberty
[26:05] to move among us lord jesus
[26:07] we thank you lord god for your grace and
[26:09] this hour and our lord lord jesus and i
[26:11] pray god that you'll give us grace to
[26:13] have understanding now we pray in the
[26:15] name of the lord jesus christ
[26:18] so i'm going to take a
[26:20] the title for this this sermon is in my
[26:23] father's house
[26:25] and uh and and again i'm i'm i'm
[26:27] preaching off of the sermon things that
[26:29] are to be and so i say that because you
[26:31] know uh
[26:33] really you know as brother branham got
[26:35] closer and closer to the end of the of
[26:37] his ministry
[26:39] seems like the things that he said began
[26:41] to get stranger and stranger and almost
[26:43] almost some of the things like in this
[26:45] message that you will you may be reading
[26:46] some of the quotes that almost stumbles
[26:48] a lot of people
[26:50] and i really want to get you to
[26:52] encourage to go back into the message
[26:54] and find out do you really understand
[26:56] the message because there's some very
[26:58] perplexing things that little statements
[27:00] that brother branham says like in this
[27:02] sermon in the sermon after this modern
[27:04] events made made clear by prophecy
[27:05] brother adam begins to explain how you
[27:08] say you've got the baptism of the holy
[27:09] ghost but that's not really that's
[27:11] there's something more than that right
[27:13] you say you've got the baptism there's
[27:14] the quotes that where brother brown said
[27:16] that you could have the baptism in the
[27:17] holy ghost every day of your life and
[27:18] die and go to hell what does that mean
[27:20] that's a very perplexing thing what do
[27:22] those kind of statements mean and so i
[27:24] want to dive into those and this morning
[27:26] and if you if you begin to wonder what
[27:29] are the
[27:30] is are there things that are brother bob
[27:32] saying are they really are they really
[27:34] true
[27:35] go back into this message and study it
[27:37] out and find out just really meditate on
[27:40] the quotes
[27:41] the things that are to be so let's read
[27:43] in john chapter 14 verses 1 to 8 and
[27:46] just to kind of set the stage now think
[27:48] now this is the this is the things that
[27:51] jesus said to his disciples
[27:54] just before he died
[27:56] now brother branham preached this sermon
[27:59] and less than 20 days later he died
[28:04] now said that as the context
[28:06] and this sermon things that are to be
[28:10] and jesus said let now your heart be
[28:12] troubled
[28:14] that's a good that's a good statement in
[28:16] this hour
[28:18] you believe in god believe also in me
[28:22] in my father's house are many mansions
[28:24] if it were not so i would have told you
[28:26] i go to prepare a place for
[28:28] you and if i go and prepare a place for
[28:31] you i will come again and receive you
[28:33] unto myself that where i am there ye may
[28:36] be also
[28:37] and whether i go you know and the way
[28:40] you know
[28:41] thomas saith unto him lord we know not
[28:43] wither thou goest and how can we know
[28:45] the way
[28:46] jesus saith unto him i am the way the
[28:49] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[28:51] the father but my me
[28:53] if you know me you should have known my
[28:56] father also and from henceforth you know
[28:58] him
[28:59] and have seen him you may be seated the
[29:02] lord had his blessing to the reading of
[29:03] the word
[29:04] now that little scripture i love the
[29:06] book of john but because this he's got
[29:08] that eagle ministry and he really says
[29:10] some things that that really i believe
[29:12] apply to the bride now now that things
[29:15] maybe that people have probed at for the
[29:16] ages but now we can really begin to
[29:18] understand
[29:19] and and it's just the things that jesus
[29:21] just said are maybe compared to the
[29:23] things that are in the prophet's message
[29:25] because they're they're very they're
[29:26] very strange strangely worded and truly
[29:30] you must have a revelation of jesus
[29:32] christ to be able to understand the
[29:34] things that are spoken it cannot be
[29:35] understood just by you know a lot of
[29:37] times you want the minister to explain
[29:39] explain it to me just like lay it out
[29:41] for me but it really god has to speak to
[29:44] you to open up these things that are
[29:45] worded in such a way that it's hidden
[29:47] from the wise and the proven it's hidden
[29:49] from the people that are real careful i
[29:50] don't know if i want to get mixed up in
[29:52] that but if you'll do like the bereans
[29:54] and get into the scripture and really
[29:55] study things out it will it will begin
[29:57] to change your life it will actually
[29:59] change you
[30:01] and you'll begin to understand
[30:02] now now it says there in verse 3 that he
[30:06] he left them he was going to leave them
[30:08] to prepare a place
[30:10] so that they could be together and if i
[30:12] go and prepare a place for you jesus
[30:14] said i will come again and receive you
[30:16] unto myself that where i am there ye may
[30:20] be also
[30:22] now the bible says in hebrews 13 5 it
[30:25] says let your conversation be without
[30:26] covetousness and be content with such
[30:29] things as you have for he hath said i
[30:30] will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[30:34] now that's one of the first little
[30:35] paradoxes and the things that i want to
[30:36] talk about this morning is that jesus is
[30:38] saying he's going to leave them but the
[30:40] bible says he will never leave you he
[30:43] said i'll never leave you so he's
[30:44] leaving he's leaving to prepare a place
[30:47] and
[30:48] where he went and died on the cross and
[30:51] and went through all the acts of of
[30:52] leaving them so that he could come back
[30:55] and be seated on the father stone in
[30:57] your heart and in in your heart to begin
[30:59] to prepare a place to begin to quicken
[31:01] something within you to begin to build
[31:03] something within you you see
[31:05] so so we want to we want to this morning
[31:07] we want to look past the things of the
[31:09] flesh and the things that we can see and
[31:11] look into this realm of the unseen and
[31:13] hear from the voice from another world
[31:15] and begin to look at something past past
[31:17] the things that we can see with our
[31:19] mortal eye
[31:20] you know the first verse in this in the
[31:22] scripture that i just read letting not
[31:24] your heart be troubled jesus says tell
[31:26] it to think about how many times jesus
[31:28] told him don't fear that the angels
[31:30] would say don't fear let you let not
[31:32] your heart be troubled and and amidst
[31:34] all of the christian journey it looks
[31:36] like there's a lot of trouble
[31:38] you know if you look at like david's
[31:40] life how he was hunted by saul and how
[31:43] he was betrayed by his own son there's a
[31:45] lot of trouble going on
[31:47] look at joseph thrown in a pit and
[31:49] thrown in prison you think now if what
[31:51] if you were to stop that trouble what if
[31:53] you were to restrict grab joseph out of
[31:56] that pit then his life the the purpose
[31:58] for his life would never been able to be
[32:00] manifest
[32:02] what if david had never been hunted by
[32:04] saul and go gone through all those
[32:06] things that were a type of christ then
[32:08] the purpose of his life would never be
[32:10] made manifest what if job the story of
[32:13] job he lost his possessions everything
[32:15] that he had he lost his children he lost
[32:17] everything except his wife there and
[32:19] even his wife began to to
[32:22] say why don't you just curse god and die
[32:24] it looked like he just lost everything
[32:26] but yet all of that trouble that he went
[32:28] through was there for a purpose and a
[32:29] lot of times we begin to think as a
[32:31] christian as our christian journey that
[32:33] it's supposed to be a life without
[32:35] trouble but god brings you through
[32:37] trouble to manifest himself to get you
[32:40] out of the way to build character in
[32:41] your life to show forth his attributes
[32:44] in your life
[32:45] my wife and i were sitting there talking
[32:47] the other night about nabeth in his
[32:49] vineyard if you think about that story
[32:50] of naboth how the the king came and took
[32:53] away his possessions and robbed him of
[32:55] what god had given him and got men to
[32:58] lie about him and told lies and pearl
[33:00] neighborhoods they're dying in the
[33:01] street and everybody's telling lies
[33:03] about him but yet he had a purpose in
[33:05] his life to manifest god had not forgot
[33:08] about him you see a few a few weeks or
[33:11] months or however long later and ahab
[33:13] and jezebel are lying in the street with
[33:15] the dogs eating their bloods because god
[33:17] had not forget forgotten about him and
[33:19] you think because you're going through
[33:20] troubles in life or because you got sick
[33:22] or because you're laying in your bed of
[33:24] pain or something's going to happen and
[33:26] on in you that god has forgotten about
[33:28] you but god has the bible says that
[33:30] he'll never leave you or forsake you
[33:33] [Music]
[33:35] so jesus jesus is leaving the disciples
[33:38] and he tells them don't don't let your
[33:39] heart be troubled now in your flesh in
[33:42] your spirit
[33:45] excuse me
[33:46] in your flesh in your spirit you might
[33:48] be troubled but let not your heart be
[33:50] troubled and and the reason your heart
[33:52] is not troubled the reason a christian's
[33:55] heart is not troubled is because jesus
[33:57] has given his peace to you and what is
[34:00] his peace his peace is his word now
[34:02] listen jesus is saying believe me let
[34:04] not your heart be troubled you believe
[34:06] in god believe also in me in other words
[34:09] he said listen listen to what i'm
[34:11] telling you if you listen to what i'm
[34:13] telling you my words will give you peace
[34:15] my words will give you a comfort that
[34:17] passes all understanding you might be
[34:19] true you might be dealing with kidney
[34:21] stones you might be dealing with kids
[34:23] that have gone away from the message you
[34:24] might be dealing with a migraine or
[34:26] frailty and sickness but down in your
[34:28] heart you know you because you've got
[34:30] that peace that passes all understanding
[34:33] that god is on your side he's saying
[34:35] listen to what i'm saying you believe in
[34:38] god believe also in me and you know that
[34:40] can be said for any ministry that's
[34:42] preaching the gospel you believe in god
[34:44] and believe also in me believe what i'm
[34:47] telling you to be the truth if i say the
[34:49] same thing that the prophet said if i
[34:51] say the same thing that jesus said it's
[34:53] still the truth it might be coming from
[34:55] a dumb donkey it might be coming from a
[34:57] man veiled behind flesh but it's still
[34:59] the truth and that same truth will give
[35:01] you peace in this hour
[35:03] letting all your heart be troubled
[35:06] and jesus said brother abraham said he
[35:08] said look if it was so easy for those
[35:10] jews who had been taught
[35:12] through generations to believe that
[35:14] there was a great supernatural god
[35:16] but to think that god had come down and
[35:18] was manifesting himself through the
[35:21] person of his son jesus christ
[35:24] god and tabernacled in a body of flesh
[35:27] that was a little too much for them to
[35:28] understand now let me just get your mind
[35:31] aligned with what the thought of this
[35:33] message is is to not look so much at the
[35:35] outward flesh not look so much of the
[35:38] things that are going on that are
[35:39] troubling in your fl in your flesh and
[35:41] troubling you in the world but look down
[35:43] see the problem that they have was they
[35:45] were
[35:46] they were unable to look beyond the
[35:48] flesh and see the god that was hiding
[35:50] behind the flesh the problem that we
[35:53] have is is where it's so difficult to
[35:55] look past the veil of flesh down on the
[35:58] inside that's the most important thing
[36:00] that's what brother and said the real
[36:01] gift of god is your soul the real gift
[36:04] of god is not this thing that you're
[36:06] tabernacled with not this body of flesh
[36:09] but the body of the the word body on the
[36:11] inside of you that god wants to give you
[36:14] see jesus jesus he said jesus therefore
[36:17] is telling his disciples that this life
[36:19] is not ended in death he said i go and
[36:22] prepare a place
[36:23] shows that there he was speaking to them
[36:25] that there was a life after this life
[36:27] has ended that this life is not all
[36:29] there is there's there's something
[36:31] greater than the things that you can see
[36:33] there's something greater than all the
[36:35] pleasures of this world the lust of the
[36:37] flesh and the pride of life there's
[36:38] something greater than anything young
[36:40] people that cigarettes and tobacco and
[36:42] alcohol and all this stuff could give
[36:44] you there's something greater than that
[36:46] and it's failed it can be veiled behind
[36:48] your flesh if you let god come in and
[36:50] take take his abode in your heart
[36:52] and brother as you get older now there's
[36:55] so many of these quotes that stand out
[36:56] in this message now just listen listen
[36:58] to this one he said as you get older
[37:02] that becomes more of a reality to you
[37:05] as you begin to see the days of your
[37:07] life drawing close
[37:09] then it begins to you begin to pack up
[37:11] closer getting ready for that great
[37:13] event it's a continuing of the same life
[37:17] in another world another place
[37:20] now as we go through this as we go
[37:22] through kind of studying this message i
[37:23] want you to kind of think now that it's
[37:25] important to understand the context that
[37:27] brother branham was preaching this
[37:28] message because a lot of the things that
[37:30] he'll say about how you got another body
[37:32] and you're going to he's he's talking
[37:34] about he's talking about death because
[37:37] he is going to die and he's setting in
[37:39] the mind of the people he's like look my
[37:41] body my body he said in paragraph 23 of
[37:44] this sermon he said this is a funeral
[37:46] message
[37:47] and now maybe this is my opinion but i
[37:49] believe he was preaching his own funeral
[37:51] that he was preaching that when you see
[37:53] my body laying in the grave that that's
[37:55] not me there's something that's there's
[37:57] something that more real than that body
[37:59] that's laying in the grave decaying
[38:01] there's something more real there's a
[38:03] real there's i have a real body
[38:05] somewhere that you don't see laying in
[38:07] that casket or laying in that grave
[38:09] something real and so don't don't get
[38:11] confused when you begin to meditate on
[38:13] the things that he's saying he's talking
[38:14] about he's talking about in one sense
[38:16] that your body would be changed but in
[38:18] another sense when you die if you were
[38:20] to die then this body would be laying
[38:22] there in the casket and that's not the
[38:24] real you you've got a real body
[38:27] something on the inside that you go to
[38:31] and he said
[38:34] he said and last night
[38:36] speaking over in yuma for the
[38:37] pre-christian business man i spoke on
[38:39] the subject of the rapture now there
[38:41] might have been a strange subject to
[38:43] speak among a banquet but most everyone
[38:44] there was christians and that's the way
[38:46] it is on these campaigns like this or in
[38:48] church i can say now how many of you as
[38:50] christians probably every hand would go
[38:51] up you're a christian and if so and so
[38:54] if we're christians now here's here's
[38:56] the point if we're christians
[38:59] the title of this sermon that i'm
[39:00] preaching from is things that are to be
[39:02] if we're christians i think we ought to
[39:05] be kindly notified ahead
[39:07] we don't have to just kind of guess at
[39:09] it
[39:10] we notified what our destination will be
[39:15] when you think about what what the grace
[39:17] god has given us to give us a message
[39:20] well we don't have to guess what's
[39:22] beyond the curtain of time we don't have
[39:24] to guess what what it will be we don't
[39:27] have to guess what the future home will
[39:29] be the whole plan of redemption has been
[39:31] laid out in front of us so that we can
[39:33] have full understanding we can have
[39:35] understanding from the book of genesis
[39:37] and before back in the back part of
[39:39] god's mind all the way to new jerusalem
[39:41] coming down from god out of heaven all
[39:44] the way to
[39:45] the uh
[39:46] the word unfolding continuously down
[39:49] through the endless ages we can have an
[39:51] understanding of all these things and
[39:53] that's why the message was given to you
[39:55] so you could have an understanding of
[39:57] what is going on now and where you're
[39:59] going that this is not all there is to
[40:01] it this is not the end of it and you see
[40:04] that is what gives you peace brothers
[40:06] and sisters that is what gives you a
[40:08] peace that passes all understanding
[40:10] let you let your heart not let not your
[40:13] heart be troubled because god has given
[40:15] his word to you that brings you peace
[40:19] in john chapter 14 verse 25 to 30 if you
[40:22] keep reading on down in that chapter he
[40:24] says peace i leave with you
[40:27] my peace i give unto you
[40:29] not as the world giveth give i unto you
[40:32] let not your heart be troubled
[40:35] neither let it be afraid and see the
[40:38] world wants to give you all kinds of
[40:40] peace that will give you just a peace
[40:41] that maybe for a moment maybe for a
[40:44] moment you get a high when you're on
[40:45] drugs or something but after you get off
[40:47] the drugs then you go down into a
[40:50] pit of despondency and despair and you
[40:52] just begin to cycle until you're getting
[40:55] up for work and you feel like what am i
[40:57] doing here and you get home and you get
[40:59] drunk on alcohol or whatever and you go
[41:01] to bed and sleep and you get up and do
[41:02] it all over again but that's not what
[41:04] god wants you to do he wants to give the
[41:06] word put the word inside of your heart
[41:08] to give you a peace that the world
[41:10] cannot give
[41:12] listen listen friends don't satisfy for
[41:14] a peace that the world tries to give you
[41:16] that the devil because there is no peace
[41:18] that the devil can give to you the only
[41:20] true peace is that kind of peace that
[41:22] jesus had when he was on that boat in
[41:24] the storm the kind of peace that passeth
[41:27] all understanding
[41:28] the peace of his word he said if you can
[41:31] believe me
[41:32] you will have peace in your heart if you
[41:35] can just believe me you believed in god
[41:37] beliefs i believe also in me
[41:39] believe in me because i'm telling you
[41:41] the words of life i'm preaching to you
[41:42] the words the words of eternal life
[41:45] and you see his mess this message tells
[41:48] us this message the bible tells us that
[41:51] there is nothing out of cater
[41:54] but abraham said in this message
[41:56] he said god knew you would be here
[41:58] he said your birth he was pre-planned
[42:01] the infinite god know to be infinite he
[42:03] had to know every flea that ever would
[42:05] be in the earth and how many times it
[42:08] would bat his eye that's infinite the
[42:10] infinite god he knowed all things
[42:12] therefore there's nothing out of cater
[42:15] he knew that you would be here he knew
[42:17] that you would be going through whatever
[42:19] trouble you're going through he knew
[42:21] whatever situation you're in tonight he
[42:23] knew if you were seeking the baptism in
[42:25] the holy ghost he know he knew in
[42:27] advance everything about you
[42:31] you know that's one of the things about
[42:32] this message and things that are to be
[42:35] that he's trying to get you to
[42:36] understand that he knew what's going on
[42:39] in your life he knew you he had it all
[42:41] planned out so when you came here
[42:43] everything would be situated so that you
[42:46] could you could manifest the word of god
[42:48] he said so you say how do i know where
[42:50] i'm at brother brown said if we know the
[42:53] word of god we know where we are living
[42:56] if we know the word of god we know where
[42:58] we're living we know where we're living
[43:00] because we can look in the bible and see
[43:02] that that there was supposed to be a
[43:04] seventh church age messenger in malachi
[43:07] 4 there was supposed to be a messenger
[43:08] come just before the world is burnt with
[43:11] ashes and we're living in that time we
[43:13] can see all these scriptures that we can
[43:14] identify ourselves with and know the day
[43:16] and the hour that we're living in
[43:18] brother brown said we know the hour that
[43:20] we're living in he said we know what
[43:23] lays ahead we see what we've passed
[43:26] think of think about that the word gives
[43:28] you knowledge of what has passed
[43:30] and you can see where you're going
[43:33] brother ram said his word spoken must
[43:35] come to pass
[43:38] you know one time the bible says that
[43:40] isaiah and isaiah 7 14 therefore the
[43:42] lord himself shall give you a sign
[43:44] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[43:46] a son and shall call his name emmanuel
[43:48] and and for unto us a child is born unto
[43:51] us a son is given and the government
[43:52] should be upon his shoulder and his name
[43:54] shall be called wonderful counselor the
[43:56] mighty god the everlasting father the
[43:58] prince of peace and you see that word
[44:00] spoken had to come to pass that word
[44:03] spoken had to be made manifest you see
[44:06] because jesus jesus's birth his life was
[44:09] prepared
[44:11] god knew before the foundation of the
[44:12] world brother brown said he was he was
[44:14] the bible says he was crucified before
[44:16] the foundation of the world all of his
[44:18] life was prepared he was prepared and so
[44:21] you are prepared now let's talk about
[44:23] how he was prepared the bible says that
[44:25] he would be born of a woman that he
[44:26] would be born in bethlehem that he would
[44:28] be born of a virgin the bible says that
[44:30] he would come from the lineage of
[44:31] abraham that he would be a descendant of
[44:33] isaac he would be a descendant of jacob
[44:35] and he would come from the tribe of
[44:36] judah the bible says that he would be
[44:38] heir to king david's throne that he will
[44:40] be his throne will be an anointed and
[44:42] eternal it would be called he would be
[44:43] called emmanuel the bible said that he
[44:46] would spend a little time in egypt and
[44:47] he's a and a massacre of children would
[44:50] occur at his birthplace the bible says
[44:52] that a messenger would prepare the way
[44:54] for the messiah and that he would be
[44:55] rejected by his own people and many many
[44:58] other prophecies the bible his way was
[45:00] prepared by the word that's spoken by
[45:03] the prophets and the prophets spoken and
[45:05] spoken and spoken until finally it was
[45:07] manifested and that little baby he had
[45:10] that manger prepared he had the place
[45:12] the little cavery was born he had all of
[45:14] that prepared so that he could come into
[45:16] being and be man manifest and the same
[45:18] thing applies to you he knew that you
[45:20] would be coming and he had it prepared
[45:22] for you brother brown said just like
[45:24] your birth here you was prepared he said
[45:27] even things that your parents done from
[45:29] generation to generation your heavenly
[45:32] body is prepared your earthly body is
[45:34] prepared
[45:35] you see that i i i i hope i'm not
[45:38] getting too deep for you this morning
[45:40] but look look now brother brown said he
[45:42] quoted this scripture in hebrews chapter
[45:44] 7 as i may say so
[45:47] levi also he receiveth tithes paid
[45:49] tithes in abraham for he was yet in the
[45:52] loins of his father when melchizedek met
[45:54] him see coming down coming down god is
[45:57] preparing he brother brown said in the
[45:59] serpent's seed he never said he'd done
[46:01] it in the shadow he potentially done it
[46:04] the bible said he paid tithes
[46:07] then if we come through the right seed
[46:08] when paul preached the gospel i was
[46:11] there
[46:12] and you were there right we're going to
[46:14] get into that in just a minute plum up
[46:16] to our ears you were prepared the whole
[46:18] plan and purpose of your coming now you
[46:20] think now now a lot of times we'll kind
[46:22] of get we'll let me let me see if i can
[46:24] slow down to address this properly i
[46:26] don't want to get so fast that you kind
[46:28] of lose lose what track of what i'm
[46:30] saying
[46:37] now levi paid tithes
[46:39] in abraham
[46:41] he was not born yet but yet he paid
[46:43] tithes in him now now think
[46:46] spiritual genealogy speaking that you
[46:49] are identified you're part of something
[46:51] you're part of something greater than
[46:53] just your own little life you're part of
[46:55] a body and if you're part of a body
[46:57] you're part of the word body the body of
[46:59] christ
[47:00] so when he walked on the shore of
[47:02] galilee you were there because you're
[47:04] part of him and when paul preached the
[47:07] gospel paul being a part of that body
[47:09] you were there you were you were part of
[47:11] that and that word line coming down from
[47:14] paul irenaeus martin columbus luther
[47:17] wesley branham and you heard one day you
[47:19] heard the gospel preached and that light
[47:22] quickened in your life the word quick
[47:24] and quicken in your life and and you're
[47:26] because you're part of something because
[47:29] you were god knew that you would be
[47:31] manifested one day in this earth and so
[47:33] he had it planned for you to hear the
[47:36] word he had a plan for it to come down
[47:38] like that like abraham isaac jacob levi
[47:42] he had a plan for all
[47:44] all the different ones to preach the
[47:46] gospel and hear it until finally it gets
[47:48] to you
[47:49] it gets to you and it's pre-planned for
[47:51] you to be manifested he said you were
[47:53] all pre-planned by god nothing happens
[47:56] by chance with god he knows all about it
[47:59] it's all pre-planned planned for many
[48:02] generations back so that you could be
[48:04] here tonight
[48:07] your natural body was planned
[48:10] your spiritual body was playing it was
[48:12] all planned out so that you could come
[48:15] into manifestation my if that that
[48:17] should get what kind of peace that
[48:19] should give the believer that god
[48:21] thought of you there he foreknew you
[48:23] before you even came into the earth and
[48:25] your mother and father were playing by
[48:27] god your all the way back was playing by
[48:29] god he knew
[48:31] so that you he planned it all out so
[48:33] that you could come into manifestation
[48:36] he said the brother brown said the only
[48:37] way that you can be a son a daughter of
[48:40] god because you have to have eternal
[48:42] life there to be a son you of god you
[48:44] had to be in him always
[48:46] the gene of your life spiritual life
[48:48] tonight was in god the father before
[48:51] there was even a molecule see
[48:53] and you are nothing but the
[48:55] manifestation of the gene of life that
[48:57] was in god as a son of god
[49:00] that gene of life was always in god that
[49:02] gene of life always was eternal and that
[49:05] gene of life now manifested in you makes
[49:07] you a part of something levi was a part
[49:10] of something levi was a part of
[49:12] something that's why he says he paid
[49:14] tithes in the loins of abraham because
[49:16] he was part of something
[49:18] you're identified as part of something
[49:20] brother you know brother brandon said if
[49:21] you're an american you're identified
[49:23] with america even all the all the bad
[49:25] things and all the good things you're
[49:27] part of it and you're part of something
[49:29] you're part of this body now now let's
[49:32] slow down for a second
[49:33] i i know i i know sometimes when i
[49:36] preach i give a lot of information
[49:39] so let's let's slow down and digest this
[49:42] a little bit
[49:44] is everybody okay i don't want to i
[49:47] don't want to firehose you you know or
[49:48] you can't hardly drink
[49:52] in first corinthians chapter 12. let's
[49:55] just meditate on first corinthians
[49:57] chapter 12 verses 12 to 14 paul says
[50:00] for as the body is one
[50:02] and half many members
[50:04] and all the members of that one body
[50:07] being many are one body so also is
[50:11] now you're part of something
[50:13] and how many bodies are you part of
[50:15] you're part of one body
[50:17] there's one body by one spirit you're
[50:20] baptized into one body
[50:23] for by one spirit
[50:25] are we all baptized into one body
[50:28] whether we be jews or gentiles or
[50:31] whether we be bond or free
[50:33] and have been all made to drink
[50:36] into one spirit
[50:38] for the body is not one member
[50:42] but many
[50:43] now
[50:44] now brother i believe that's that's the
[50:46] scripture confirming that maybe a
[50:49] paradoxical statement that brother
[50:50] brahms would say
[50:52] that god is not one like your finger
[50:54] there's one body
[50:56] but yet with many members
[50:58] for the body is not one member
[51:00] but many
[51:02] so god can manifest himself in a
[51:04] many-membered body but we're all part of
[51:07] that one body
[51:08] now if the body is the word
[51:11] the word this word body that we're all
[51:13] part of is this one theophany of god so
[51:16] we're all part of one theophany and we
[51:19] have our own word body if you're part of
[51:21] that body then you're you have you have
[51:24] your word body and you're part of this
[51:26] one word body this one word body that
[51:29] has many members and you see you see
[51:31] this is why when somebody gets sick we
[51:34] begin to feel for that other person
[51:36] that's what brotherly kindness is maybe
[51:38] you yeah maybe you don't like the
[51:40] blusteriness of somebody or you don't
[51:43] like some you know just maybe you don't
[51:45] have that much to talk about maybe
[51:47] somebody that doesn't like to hunt
[51:48] doesn't have much to talk about with
[51:50] somebody that hunts
[51:51] but yet you're all part of that one body
[51:53] and so when somebody gets sick you begin
[51:55] to feel for that person because you're
[51:57] all one body we're all part of one thing
[52:00] we're one identity and we're all moving
[52:02] together toward glory you see you see if
[52:06] if your toenail gets like zoey she she
[52:09] broke her toenail off the other day and
[52:10] we began to talk about how if your
[52:12] toenail if your toenail gets hurt you
[52:14] don't say oh well you're not you're not
[52:16] my eye you're not oh well you're just a
[52:19] little toenail you begin to get
[52:21] concerned about that little toenail you
[52:23] begin to get concerned about the the
[52:25] more uncomfortably parts of your body
[52:27] you see and you see that you think you
[52:30] think well
[52:31] i i i you think you're you just don't
[52:34] matter much but yeah you're part of the
[52:36] body and every part of the body has a
[52:38] place and a part and a purpose to
[52:40] fulfill
[52:41] you see you see the purpose of
[52:43] understanding that that gene of life
[52:45] that was in god before the foundation of
[52:47] the world there's a purpose to that and
[52:49] see when that life becomes manifested in
[52:52] a tabernacle of flesh then now that
[52:54] purpose is being made manifested god has
[52:57] a purpose for you and it's not just to
[52:59] fulfill your own lust to the flesh but
[53:01] it's to fulfill that that
[53:03] that plan that god had for you before
[53:06] the foundation of the world
[53:08] galatians four chapter four verses four
[53:10] to six it says but when the fullness of
[53:12] the time was come god sent forth his son
[53:16] made of a woman made under the law to
[53:18] redeem them that were under the law that
[53:20] we might receive the adoption of sons
[53:23] and because ye are sons god hath sent
[53:25] forth the spirit of his son into your
[53:27] hearts crying abba father because you
[53:29] are sons now now now thinking along this
[53:32] that before the foundation of the world
[53:34] god knew you when did you become a son
[53:36] now we know you had to receive it down
[53:38] here on earth we know you there had to
[53:40] come a time when you opened up the door
[53:41] of your heart and received the receive
[53:43] that eternal life but god knew before
[53:46] the foundation of the world that you
[53:47] would receive it and so it says because
[53:49] you are sons because your son he knew
[53:51] that you would receive it he knew that
[53:54] he you would open the door to receive it
[53:55] and so he had it predestinated for you
[53:59] wherever you are brother braham said
[54:01] wherever you are god knew that you would
[54:03] be here because you have to be one of
[54:05] his genes or his attributes you had to
[54:07] be if you ever if you've got eternal
[54:10] life then it always was eternal life and
[54:13] god before there was a foundation world
[54:15] knew that you would be here and when the
[54:18] word or the water the washing of the
[54:21] water of the word fell upon you it was
[54:25] expressed in a being
[54:27] now these i i don't believe that god put
[54:29] these things into the bible or sent this
[54:31] message to us to just bore us and to to
[54:34] cause us to slumber but he sent these
[54:36] words to us to give us peace in our
[54:38] heart in a time of trouble so that we
[54:40] don't begin to look at the things around
[54:42] us so that we don't begin to look even
[54:44] at our own mistakes and frailties but to
[54:46] look at god's word to keep our eye on
[54:49] his word
[54:50] and you know if if god has his way if
[54:53] god put his word in you
[54:55] then your purpose is to be a light to
[54:58] the world he plants you in a church to
[55:00] be a light to the world he plants you at
[55:01] your work to be a light to the world and
[55:03] that is your purpose to shine a light on
[55:05] the other so that others may see that
[55:07] light and come to the light
[55:10] and their eyes will be opened so that
[55:11] they don't see the darkness brother adam
[55:13] said now you're expressed after his word
[55:16] has come in you
[55:17] to light up this age your purpose is to
[55:21] light up the sage he said you are in you
[55:23] are now made you're sitting in this
[55:24] church tonight because your duty is to
[55:28] express god to this nation and this
[55:31] people and this neighborhood where you
[55:33] associate
[55:35] my goodness to think that that is your
[55:38] that is your purpose is to be a light to
[55:40] others and and we would be dare said to
[55:43] cover over that light and say well i
[55:44] don't want to sing in the church i don't
[55:46] want to sing i don't i don't want to
[55:47] come and sing a special when god has
[55:49] given you a gift to do that my i don't
[55:51] want to lead songs or whatever because i
[55:53] don't like doing it i don't want to
[55:55] preach the gospel because god has given
[55:57] you a gift and a purpose in this life
[55:59] and it's not up to us to cover over that
[56:01] light to put a bushel over that thing
[56:03] like jesus said neither do men light a
[56:05] candle and put it under a bushel but on
[56:07] a candlestick and it giveth light unto
[56:09] all that are in the house god has given
[56:11] you a gift god has given you a measure
[56:13] of himself to be to be a witness to
[56:16] people to be a help to people to be an
[56:18] encouragement to people and that's why
[56:20] he said let your life so shine before
[56:22] men that they may see your good works
[56:24] and glorify your father which is in
[56:26] heaven because why we're identified and
[56:29] cr we have an identity with him
[56:31] we're identified with god
[56:33] now he said now then if it was jesus was
[56:35] the fullness of god manifested he was
[56:38] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[56:39] therefore when he came to the earth and
[56:41] was manifested in flesh you were here in
[56:45] him then because he was the word
[56:48] you were here and then because of that
[56:51] scripture we just read that you're part
[56:53] of that body
[56:54] you're part of that body you're part of
[56:56] that
[56:57] of the word and brother baby said
[56:59] therefore
[57:01] you walked with him yes when you were in
[57:04] him
[57:04] when he was on earth
[57:06] you suffered with him
[57:09] and you died with him
[57:11] you was buried with him
[57:13] and now you are risen with him
[57:15] and manifested attributes of god
[57:18] setting into heavenly places
[57:20] already raised resurrected to new life
[57:24] and setting in heavenly places in christ
[57:27] jesus
[57:28] now now i think you see that scripture
[57:30] that we read when i began to preach open
[57:33] the sermon that in my father's house are
[57:35] many mansions now that begins to mean
[57:38] something a little bit more that now in
[57:40] my father's house in my father in this
[57:43] body word there are many members in my
[57:46] father's kingdom there are many mansions
[57:49] in my father's theophany there are many
[57:51] word bodies that make up this one word
[57:54] body you see i hope we're not getting
[57:56] too deep here but listen this message is
[57:58] deep god gave us a message that we're
[58:00] supposed to get out and swim and not
[58:02] just baby around and just kind of preach
[58:04] a little altar calling something but
[58:06] this message is something that will
[58:08] bring us to a higher calling if you'll
[58:10] get into it get into the word let it not
[58:13] bore you but let go rise from your sleep
[58:15] and your slumber and get into the word
[58:18] the spirit reveals that you are part of
[58:21] him you're part of that word body
[58:25] john chapter 14 verse 18 20 it says i
[58:27] will not leave you comfortless
[58:30] i will come to you
[58:32] little get a little while and the world
[58:34] seeth me no more but ye see me because i
[58:37] live ye shall live also
[58:40] at that day ye shall know that i am in
[58:43] my father and ye and me
[58:46] and i in you in other words he's put his
[58:49] life in you and that makes you part of
[58:52] the body that makes you part of him he
[58:56] is in you and you are in him
[58:59] you see why did brother breton preach
[59:00] this message at the end of his ministry
[59:02] just before he went off the scene so
[59:04] that your heart would not be troubled
[59:06] that he is going off the scene because
[59:09] something is the bride is about to catch
[59:11] a revelation of what this message really
[59:13] is
[59:14] just because he's leaving don't let your
[59:16] heart be troubled but something is going
[59:18] to happen jesus when he preached this
[59:20] scripture he said letting not your heart
[59:22] be troubled to his disciples as he was
[59:24] about to go off the scene just because
[59:27] jesus is going off the scene it's making
[59:29] a way for something greater for for the
[59:31] outpouring of the holy ghost
[59:36] now
[59:39] now if you are part of the word
[59:42] if you are part of this word body if you
[59:45] are part of christ then what do you live
[59:48] by if you're part of the word then you
[59:50] live by the word isn't that true the
[59:53] word bride must live by the word
[59:57] and brother brian said now if we are
[59:59] those attributes of god we cannot live
[1:00:01] by creeds
[1:00:02] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[1:00:05] must live by the word because the bride
[1:00:08] is a part of the bridegroom like any
[1:00:10] wife is a part of her husband therefore
[1:00:12] we must be that word bride and what is
[1:00:15] that word bride
[1:00:16] what is that he's going to tell you what
[1:00:18] is
[1:00:19] that word bride
[1:00:22] the manifestation of this hour
[1:00:25] the bride yes not a creed or
[1:00:28] denomination
[1:00:29] but a living oracle of god
[1:00:33] do you know what an oracle is an oracle
[1:00:35] is where you go
[1:00:37] to hear directly from god
[1:00:40] so the bride now is the oracle of god
[1:00:43] if you want to know what god's will is
[1:00:45] then you come to where the voice is you
[1:00:48] come to the bride and you see let's not
[1:00:50] get stumbled over in that we know that
[1:00:53] brother branham was the voice to this
[1:00:55] age but if you catch the revelation of
[1:00:58] what that voice said then now you are an
[1:01:02] oracle of the living god
[1:01:04] that you can come to a member of that
[1:01:06] body and receive directly from god
[1:01:11] doesn't the scripture say that ye are
[1:01:13] gods
[1:01:14] if you have ye are gods who the word
[1:01:16] came to they are gods who the word come
[1:01:18] to and if the word comes to you and you
[1:01:21] have a living revelation of the word of
[1:01:23] god a present tense revelation of the
[1:01:25] word of god for your age
[1:01:28] and he was saying the same thing that
[1:01:30] the prophet said you become a living
[1:01:33] oracle of god now now brother bob that's
[1:01:35] a little bit too deep but yeah your
[1:01:37] prophet said that i'm not saying it i'm
[1:01:39] just reading you the quote
[1:01:40] now now see that's where that's where we
[1:01:43] come to to to maybe a turning point are
[1:01:46] you willing to lay down your own creeds
[1:01:49] and your own ideas and accept what the
[1:01:51] prophet said this is not my thought this
[1:01:54] is not my idea but he said the bride
[1:01:57] would be the manifestation of this hour
[1:02:00] that's what he said
[1:02:01] he said the bride not a creed or a
[1:02:03] denomination no the bride will not be a
[1:02:06] manifestation of the baptist church or
[1:02:08] the methodist church but he said god had
[1:02:10] to come with a message himself and she
[1:02:13] will be the living oracle of that
[1:02:15] message she will be a living oracle of
[1:02:18] god
[1:02:20] an oracle is someone that is able to
[1:02:22] communicate with the deity
[1:02:24] able to communicate with god
[1:02:27] and he said a living attribute of god
[1:02:29] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:02:32] of god in the formation of the bride
[1:02:34] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:02:37] we're now living in
[1:02:39] now now martin luther could not express
[1:02:41] the attributes that we express
[1:02:43] martin luther was expressing the
[1:02:45] attributes for his day
[1:02:47] because that was in the beginning
[1:02:49] brother brown said the resurrection like
[1:02:50] the corn of wheat that went into the
[1:02:52] earth
[1:02:52] he said he said now listen he said i
[1:02:54] don't believe that a person just
[1:02:56] happened to be here by chance because
[1:02:59] the reason he's saying that is because
[1:03:00] you your purpose is to make manifest the
[1:03:04] word for your day
[1:03:06] not the not the word for another day but
[1:03:08] the word for the present tense word for
[1:03:11] this day
[1:03:15] excuse me
[1:03:16] and brother brian said now listen he
[1:03:18] said you grew
[1:03:20] from your birth when you was born and
[1:03:21] presented into the world
[1:03:23] god knew that you were going to be here
[1:03:25] in this earth and you growed from birth
[1:03:27] to maturity
[1:03:29] things that seem so strange to you in
[1:03:32] your young womanhood young boyhood as
[1:03:34] children now seems very real
[1:03:37] you couldn't understand it when you was
[1:03:39] a child but now as you become adult
[1:03:41] you begin to understand and find out
[1:03:44] that everything will sit just right you
[1:03:47] it really means something to you now
[1:03:51] you see how your natural birth parallels
[1:03:54] your spiritual birth when you're a
[1:03:55] little baby you couldn't understand
[1:03:57] things but as you grow up in in just
[1:03:59] your natural life then you begin to
[1:04:01] understand how how to pay taxes and how
[1:04:04] to buy a home and you begin to
[1:04:06] understand things that you couldn't
[1:04:07] understand as a baby and the same thing
[1:04:09] in your spiritual birth as you grow as
[1:04:12] you as you grow into your adulthood you
[1:04:14] can look back on that time when you were
[1:04:16] at the altar and the time that you
[1:04:18] didn't understand what the message was
[1:04:19] about and as the word began to he put
[1:04:22] word upon word and now it begins to make
[1:04:24] more sense
[1:04:26] you look back and all those things that
[1:04:28] you probed at that didn't make sense at
[1:04:30] first but now they do because the pieces
[1:04:32] are beginning to come together
[1:04:34] and brother branham said so is it in
[1:04:36] your spiritual birth you do things that
[1:04:39] you don't understand when you're a
[1:04:40] little baby you come to the altar you
[1:04:42] give your life to christ you you do such
[1:04:44] strange things strange things you wonder
[1:04:47] why you did it but after a while when
[1:04:49] you mature as mature christians then you
[1:04:51] understand it see then you understand it
[1:04:57] he said how it fitted to you in this
[1:04:59] life as you grew everything fitted right
[1:05:01] in because you were made for that right
[1:05:06] wasn't it a strange thing the night that
[1:05:08] you staggered into the mission the tent
[1:05:10] meeting of the little church somewhere
[1:05:11] on the corner that's something the
[1:05:13] preacher preached on a certain subject
[1:05:14] and you just fell right at the altar see
[1:05:18] god knew that before the foundation of
[1:05:20] the world
[1:05:21] it seems strange to you why you did it
[1:05:23] then but now you understand
[1:05:26] you knew what happened it's so fitting
[1:05:28] to you in this life and will be also in
[1:05:31] the life that is to come
[1:05:33] this world and its life seems to advance
[1:05:36] as you mature everything seems to go
[1:05:39] right with you and you see as you in
[1:05:42] your spiritual birth you begin to
[1:05:44] realize that that you were not made for
[1:05:47] this world the carnal world i'm speaking
[1:05:49] of the the thing the the
[1:05:52] all the carnality and all this but you
[1:05:54] were made for a higher purpose
[1:05:57] we're not believing just in a myth or a
[1:05:59] fantasy brother brandon said heaven is a
[1:06:01] place just as real as this is
[1:06:04] where we don't sit up there for eternity
[1:06:06] and just sit there on a cloud
[1:06:08] we don't just strum our heart for all
[1:06:10] for all all from here ever but we're
[1:06:12] going to a real place where we're going
[1:06:16] to do things where we're going to live
[1:06:19] now things that ought to be
[1:06:21] let's set our let's set our mind on
[1:06:23] things that ought to be for a second and
[1:06:25] think about where we're going he said
[1:06:28] we're going
[1:06:29] to work
[1:06:35] now in our natural life we work
[1:06:38] but in this place that we're going this
[1:06:40] spiritual place that we're being birthed
[1:06:42] into
[1:06:43] we're going to
[1:06:44] work
[1:06:46] we're going to enjoy
[1:06:48] in other words he's saying we're not
[1:06:50] just going to sit around strumming on a
[1:06:51] heart for all eternity but see you have
[1:06:54] a purpose you're not just going to sit
[1:06:56] around up there like watching dandelions
[1:06:58] grow maybe i i would like to do that for
[1:07:01] maybe a thousand years when we get over
[1:07:02] there and just kind of watch and observe
[1:07:04] but you have a purpose you're not going
[1:07:06] to just spend all of your time they're
[1:07:08] just sitting around we're we're going to
[1:07:10] work
[1:07:11] we're going to enjoy
[1:07:13] we're going to live
[1:07:15] we're going to life
[1:07:17] to a real eternal life
[1:07:19] we're going to a heaven a paradise
[1:07:22] just like adam and eve worked and lived
[1:07:25] and eat and enjoyed and the garden of
[1:07:27] eden before sin came in we're on our
[1:07:30] road right back there again
[1:07:32] right back and so then that trivializes
[1:07:36] it makes nothing all the troubles and
[1:07:37] things that we're going through doesn't
[1:07:38] it
[1:07:40] you have all these aches and pains in
[1:07:42] your body i think louise was talking
[1:07:44] about how that you start getting these
[1:07:46] aches and pains and and that's certainly
[1:07:48] that's true as i get older you know
[1:07:50] we were talking about i need to make an
[1:07:52] appointment to go to the doctor again
[1:07:53] and and how would i even start it's like
[1:07:56] the older you get the longer the list
[1:07:57] gets well what's wrong with you let me
[1:07:59] get off the list and just start playing
[1:08:01] the banjo because the list is so long
[1:08:03] but you see all these troubles and
[1:08:05] things
[1:08:06] uh let not your heart be troubled
[1:08:08] you believe god and god believe also in
[1:08:11] me but you believe the word and the word
[1:08:13] is what gives you peace that this is not
[1:08:16] all there is to it
[1:08:19] the things that you see all these
[1:08:20] troubles and things
[1:08:21] we're going through life to build
[1:08:23] character we're going through life to
[1:08:24] build to build to so that we can you
[1:08:26] know like one thing that troubles do is
[1:08:29] it really solidifies your relationship
[1:08:31] with god when you come out of trouble
[1:08:32] then it's like you know god more than
[1:08:34] you knew him before you went into the
[1:08:36] trouble when you go through some trouble
[1:08:38] you begin to rely on him more and you
[1:08:40] begin to get serious with god and you
[1:08:41] being getting a call out to him and
[1:08:44] things and when you come out the other
[1:08:45] side you said i thought i loved him
[1:08:47] before but now i know that i love him
[1:08:49] and now i know that he loves me and you
[1:08:52] see your troubles are working something
[1:08:54] in you and and it's been squeezing out
[1:08:56] something it's squeezing out the
[1:08:58] manifestation of god from the inside
[1:09:00] working out it's producing something in
[1:09:02] you
[1:09:03] like grapes being squeezed it squeezes
[1:09:05] out something good
[1:09:07] letting all your heart be troubled jesus
[1:09:09] said you believe in god also believe in
[1:09:11] me in my father's house or many mansions
[1:09:14] if it were not so i would have told you
[1:09:16] i'd go to prepare a place for you
[1:09:18] now things that ought to be this sermon
[1:09:20] things that ought to be is about is
[1:09:22] about your mansion
[1:09:24] your mansion and let's just
[1:09:26] i hope you all aren't getting tired on
[1:09:27] me
[1:09:30] you know a lot of times when brother
[1:09:32] branham if you listen to brother brown
[1:09:34] he doesn't preach real excited or
[1:09:35] anything and it's easy to have it in the
[1:09:38] background and just kind of like maybe
[1:09:39] doze a little bit but my goodness
[1:09:42] there's so many nuggets and things in
[1:09:43] the message even though he's not
[1:09:45] preaching maybe animated or whatever but
[1:09:47] yeah it's eternal life laying it laying
[1:09:50] on that tape
[1:09:51] so so
[1:09:52] let these words give you peace that in
[1:09:54] my father's house are many mansions
[1:09:57] if it were not so i would have told you
[1:09:59] and brother branham said when he began
[1:10:01] to preach on this in this sermon he said
[1:10:02] now now i'm not trying to change the
[1:10:05] word to give him anything
[1:10:06] don't be stumbled over by the way that
[1:10:08] he approaches this but he says
[1:10:10] in my father's house is many kinds of
[1:10:14] mansions
[1:10:15] many kinds and i i think this would give
[1:10:18] you peace
[1:10:19] this will give you peace that you think
[1:10:21] a lot of times in
[1:10:22] in the in crit in your christian walk
[1:10:24] you begin to think that you're supposed
[1:10:26] to be like somebody else now see we
[1:10:29] don't pattern ourselves after somebody
[1:10:31] else we pattern ourselves after the word
[1:10:33] and so that's an important thing to
[1:10:35] realize that in the in my father's house
[1:10:37] are many kinds of mansions
[1:10:40] many kinds of mansion now a mansion is a
[1:10:44] the the greek word is is the way i
[1:10:46] remember is mon it sounds like money
[1:10:48] monet the greek word monet is where you
[1:10:51] abode
[1:10:52] your abode a mansion is your abode where
[1:10:55] you live in so there's many kinds of
[1:10:58] mansions
[1:10:59] and brother branham said now he said i
[1:11:00] don't believe that when we get to heaven
[1:11:02] that we will be just everybody looked
[1:11:04] just exactly alike if all the mansions
[1:11:07] were exactly alike then everybody you
[1:11:10] wouldn't be able to tell anybody apart
[1:11:11] but there's differences there's blond
[1:11:13] people there's brown people there's
[1:11:15] black people there's different kind of
[1:11:17] color people different kind of hair
[1:11:19] different kind of eye color and
[1:11:20] different kinds of attitudes and thank
[1:11:23] god that he make that god loves variety
[1:11:25] so that we can all manifest a different
[1:11:28] part of the word different different
[1:11:30] expressing different parts of the word
[1:11:32] and that's the way god wanted it that's
[1:11:34] the way did you know brother brown even
[1:11:36] said that when you came into the world
[1:11:38] that he put mountains for you and
[1:11:41] streams and that's why some people like
[1:11:43] to go up to pigeon forge for vacation
[1:11:45] and some people like to go hunting and
[1:11:46] some people like to go to the beach
[1:11:48] because god said brother brahma said
[1:11:50] that god made that for you
[1:11:53] that he knew the kind of person you
[1:11:56] would be and so when you were born here
[1:11:59] he made those things for you to make you
[1:12:02] happy
[1:12:03] like my wife gets out of the backyard
[1:12:04] and she my wife loves birds and and and
[1:12:07] she's kind of it's kind of rubbed off on
[1:12:09] me a little bit i start you know we can
[1:12:10] identify birds and things because god
[1:12:13] made those birds for my wife and you too
[1:12:15] if you love birds he made the birds so
[1:12:17] that when you go outside they sing to
[1:12:19] you and those kind of things
[1:12:20] now think about how gracious and loving
[1:12:23] god is that he knew you so well that he
[1:12:26] knew that when you got here that you
[1:12:29] would like the mountains or the oceans
[1:12:31] or the birds or the rivers or whatever
[1:12:32] and he said i'm gonna put this right
[1:12:34] here i'm going to put this hunting spot
[1:12:36] for brother wade i'm going to put this
[1:12:38] beach for for sister monica i'm going to
[1:12:40] put this over this mountain up here that
[1:12:43] bro i know brother bob likes to go go up
[1:12:45] and just sit in the mountains sometimes
[1:12:46] and go on hiking trails and things i'm
[1:12:48] going to make this for him and he made
[1:12:50] those things for you think about the
[1:12:52] love of god and and and he knew he's
[1:12:55] doing the same thing for your future
[1:12:57] home when you get over there he's got it
[1:13:00] all situated just the way that you he
[1:13:03] knows that you will like it
[1:13:06] my mind to think about
[1:13:10] to think about the grace of god that he
[1:13:12] knows you better than you know yourself
[1:13:14] he when you get over there you're going
[1:13:16] to be surprised at the things that you
[1:13:18] like
[1:13:20] wow i didn't know that i was going to
[1:13:22] like like everything situated like this
[1:13:24] with a little creek in my backyard or
[1:13:27] whatever it's going to be but you see
[1:13:28] he's building he made you he made your
[1:13:31] personality just to fit you he made
[1:13:34] everything about you he made your body
[1:13:35] to fit you
[1:13:37] brother said i don't believe that when
[1:13:38] we get to heaven that we will be just
[1:13:40] everybody look just alike i don't
[1:13:42] believe that that all will be blondes or
[1:13:45] brunettes or little
[1:13:47] or all big or all giants i believe that
[1:13:51] god is a god of variety he's got big
[1:13:54] mountains and little mountains he's got
[1:13:56] planes he's got deserts he's got
[1:13:58] different things because he made it the
[1:14:01] way he wanted it and he made the season
[1:14:03] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[1:14:06] seasons it shows he's a god of variety
[1:14:10] he made you in a rut
[1:14:12] now think about that maybe the young
[1:14:14] people sitting here tonight old i don't
[1:14:16] like the way that i look but god made
[1:14:18] you that way he put he gave you the
[1:14:21] personality all the things about you he
[1:14:23] made you that way he produced you that
[1:14:25] way to manifest his attributes
[1:14:28] he made you in a variety he said some
[1:14:30] men are real blusterous
[1:14:32] and some men are real now think about
[1:14:35] that a lot of times you think well i
[1:14:37] don't know if a real blusterous man has
[1:14:38] got the holy ghost
[1:14:40] i don't know i don't know if i like that
[1:14:42] person but god makes people in a variety
[1:14:45] and some one man might be real
[1:14:47] blusterous and he said and some are real
[1:14:49] dogmatic
[1:14:51] how many how many preachers have you
[1:14:53] have you heard uh i i i'm not gonna call
[1:14:56] his name but i remember the preacher
[1:14:57] that led my parents to the message boy
[1:15:00] he he he was real dogmatic he told my
[1:15:02] mama he said you got an evil spirit on
[1:15:04] you because you got them pants on and he
[1:15:06] laid it out there through not didn't not
[1:15:08] caring about feelings or anything a lot
[1:15:10] of times we think well we should care
[1:15:11] about about fear we don't want to hurt
[1:15:12] no feelings but he
[1:15:14] they came to the message and he laid the
[1:15:16] word right out there and told them the
[1:15:18] truth some are real dogmatic and see
[1:15:21] sometimes you need somebody that's real
[1:15:22] dogmatic sometimes you need somebody
[1:15:24] that's real blusterous somebody
[1:15:26] sometimes you need somebody that's a
[1:15:28] little softer because god is a god of
[1:15:30] variety and he put all those gifts into
[1:15:32] the body because we're part of one body
[1:15:34] that's all working together
[1:15:38] and he said and others are fine others
[1:15:40] are kind
[1:15:42] think about that some are blusterous
[1:15:44] some are dogmatic others are fine others
[1:15:46] are kind
[1:15:48] and you just find all different kinds of
[1:15:51] people in his kingdom
[1:15:53] now brother brown said look at saint
[1:15:54] peter and judging by andrew no he can't
[1:15:56] do that now
[1:15:58] andrew was a prayer warrior and he spent
[1:16:00] all his time in prayer and he said he
[1:16:01] said he just stayed on his knees all the
[1:16:03] time and the apostle peter was one of
[1:16:05] those firebrands that preached
[1:16:09] and paul was more scholarly like more of
[1:16:11] the like the prophet or something and
[1:16:13] set back now i i believe that's one
[1:16:15] thing that people in the message need to
[1:16:16] understand is that it's good to have a
[1:16:18] fiery preacher like peter but every once
[1:16:20] in a while you need a some good teaching
[1:16:22] like paul come on and lay the word down
[1:16:25] and then then like like paul said i i
[1:16:27] planted an apollos is watered let the
[1:16:29] word be planted and then let a real
[1:16:31] firebrand come through and water that on
[1:16:33] top of it
[1:16:34] you need you need everything in the body
[1:16:37] see we get so balanced sometimes because
[1:16:38] we wanted things just a particular way
[1:16:40] we uh you know there's churches in the
[1:16:42] message that they like they're preaching
[1:16:44] like peter and there's churches in the
[1:16:45] message that they like they're preaching
[1:16:46] like paul and different people they like
[1:16:49] want somebody like andrew we need all
[1:16:51] these different gifts we need them
[1:16:52] that's why we need a five-fold ministry
[1:16:54] we need the whole
[1:16:56] because listen you may be able to profit
[1:16:58] more by by my preaching sometimes you
[1:17:00] may be able to preach from brother
[1:17:01] prophet from brother wage or brother
[1:17:03] dales or brother louise's a different
[1:17:05] time different part times in your
[1:17:06] journey but you see it's god has given
[1:17:09] us all different gifts different ways of
[1:17:11] manifesting a variety so that you may be
[1:17:14] able to profit and we need it all right
[1:17:18] now notice many many mansions many kinds
[1:17:21] of mansions the father knew that you
[1:17:23] would be here and prepared everything
[1:17:25] before for you before you got here your
[1:17:28] first coming your first coming here
[1:17:30] he had it ready for you when he got when
[1:17:32] you got here
[1:17:34] and so
[1:17:36] he he said when you see a man here
[1:17:38] when you see a man here struggling to
[1:17:40] live
[1:17:41] somebody in a hospital or on a sick bed
[1:17:44] or in an accident struggling and the
[1:17:46] death rattle is in their throat
[1:17:48] and pulling and crying and screaming for
[1:17:50] life what does that mean
[1:17:52] there's a place somewhere there's a body
[1:17:54] that doesn't struggle and scream for
[1:17:56] that see it just doesn't fit you see
[1:17:59] that is what gives us peace
[1:18:01] to know that when you see somebody
[1:18:03] struggling in the hospital on a
[1:18:05] ventilator or whatever and you see
[1:18:07] somebody get in an accident or whatever
[1:18:10] they got their body might be all tore up
[1:18:12] broke legs and things or maybe not just
[1:18:14] sitting in church dealing with kidney
[1:18:16] stones and troubles in their life but
[1:18:18] yet there's something your body is
[1:18:21] pulling and crying and screaming for
[1:18:23] something else it's thirsting for for a
[1:18:26] land beyond the river
[1:18:28] there's a place somewhere there's a body
[1:18:30] that doesn't struggle and scream for
[1:18:32] that
[1:18:33] amen now
[1:18:35] y'all doing okay
[1:18:38] the clock's circling around see
[1:18:43] see i want to get to some of these
[1:18:45] things because there's there's some deep
[1:18:46] things in this message that are kind of
[1:18:48] can be a little bit confusing brother
[1:18:50] branham in this semester is things that
[1:18:52] are to be now go back and read this
[1:18:54] message and study it and meditate on it
[1:18:56] i want to encourage you he's talking
[1:18:58] about bodies and it seems a little bit
[1:19:00] con you know we we believe that this
[1:19:03] body will be redeemed but he begins to
[1:19:05] talk maybe in a confusing way that this
[1:19:07] body is gonna this body is gonna be come
[1:19:10] to an end and this body is gonna uh he's
[1:19:12] talking about the body going into the
[1:19:14] grave and you go to another body it
[1:19:16] sounds like and that begins to you pray
[1:19:18] for a revelation of what he's talking
[1:19:20] about because he's speaking of in my
[1:19:22] father's house there are many mansions
[1:19:24] and you're mentioning as an abode and we
[1:19:26] talked about how that you are in one
[1:19:28] body you're part of one body part of one
[1:19:30] word theophany body but yet there's
[1:19:33] something something down on the inside
[1:19:35] that's the real
[1:19:36] you this is not your real body your real
[1:19:39] body is on the inside
[1:19:43] so let's go to second corinthians
[1:19:45] chapter 5
[1:19:46] verses 1 to 4.
[1:19:48] and paul says
[1:19:50] for we know
[1:19:52] that if our earthly house of this
[1:19:54] tabernacle were dissolved
[1:19:56] if this if this body were dissolved
[1:19:59] we have a building of god
[1:20:02] and house not made with hands
[1:20:05] eternal in the heavens
[1:20:07] in other words you got a mansion
[1:20:10] we have a building of god not a body
[1:20:12] that was produced by a product of sexual
[1:20:15] desire of carnality of sin but you have
[1:20:19] a building that god made
[1:20:22] and house not made with hands eternal in
[1:20:25] the heavens
[1:20:26] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[1:20:29] to be clothed upon with our house which
[1:20:32] is from heaven in other words earnestly
[1:20:35] desiring for all of this to to be
[1:20:37] consumed by that house that's on the
[1:20:40] inside to become to be clothed on so
[1:20:43] that we don't have to deal with this
[1:20:45] anymore so that we don't have to deal
[1:20:46] with this trouble we don't have to deal
[1:20:48] with all the temptations of life and all
[1:20:50] these things we're groaning to be
[1:20:53] clothed upon
[1:20:55] if so be that being clothed
[1:20:58] we shall not be found naked
[1:21:01] for we that are in this tabernacle do
[1:21:04] groan
[1:21:05] being burdened
[1:21:06] not for that we would be unclothed
[1:21:09] but clothed upon
[1:21:12] that mortality
[1:21:14] might be swallowed up
[1:21:17] of life
[1:21:19] you see that's what we're groaning for
[1:21:21] that we're in this tabernacle in this
[1:21:23] body of carnality and we're groaning
[1:21:26] within ourselves do you realize that's
[1:21:28] why you come to church because you're
[1:21:30] groaning for this to be swallowed up of
[1:21:33] life you're something inside of you is
[1:21:35] groaning because you're part of the word
[1:21:38] and because you're part of the word you
[1:21:40] feast on the word you desire the word
[1:21:42] and that's why you desire to come to
[1:21:44] church that's why it's such a groaning
[1:21:47] thing to be
[1:21:48] quarantined at home and to be away from
[1:21:50] people because there's something on the
[1:21:52] inside that's groaning for life for the
[1:21:55] for all of this to be swallowed up
[1:21:59] brother brown said we are now in christ
[1:22:01] jesus babes in christ children of god
[1:22:04] waiting for the full deliverance at the
[1:22:07] coming of our lord jesus to receive us
[1:22:09] up unto himself when the body this
[1:22:12] mortal will take on immortality
[1:22:17] now he says and now when this body this
[1:22:19] body is dropped here in this earth
[1:22:22] like the baby is dropped
[1:22:24] also there is an immortal body waiting
[1:22:27] to receive the spirit back into itself
[1:22:30] again
[1:22:32] now think about how my
[1:22:34] so many deep things to really meditate
[1:22:37] on when this body is dropped here in
[1:22:40] this earth when you come into the earth
[1:22:42] then you're this that little soul enters
[1:22:45] into that body
[1:22:46] and when this drops
[1:22:49] you have somewhere to go
[1:22:51] there's a body there that you step into
[1:22:54] or step
[1:22:55] see
[1:22:56] to frame that right that's very
[1:22:58] difficult to walk that tight line
[1:23:00] there's a body on the inside of you that
[1:23:03] god is building a mansion of god a
[1:23:05] theophany word body and when this body
[1:23:08] drops so you just right go right into
[1:23:10] that
[1:23:12] brother said just as the body gives you
[1:23:14] here just as this body he gave you to
[1:23:16] live in only expresses that there is one
[1:23:20] that is greater
[1:23:21] yet to come a body that yet to come that
[1:23:24] you cannot seed now
[1:23:26] you cannot see but it's one day
[1:23:29] it will be revealed
[1:23:34] now see
[1:23:36] see god is looking at your future
[1:23:38] he's looking he's already in your future
[1:23:41] he's already looking at the things that
[1:23:43] are to be he knows where you're going to
[1:23:46] see now i've got the problem of trying
[1:23:48] to wind up here i'm running out i
[1:23:49] honestly i could preach for another two
[1:23:51] hours
[1:23:53] i know i know that puts a little bit of
[1:23:55] panic in some people's hearts but
[1:23:58] all right
[1:23:59] i'm going to find it i'm going to find a
[1:24:00] place to close up here so i i don't want
[1:24:02] to keep you i know how it is
[1:24:04] and he said he already sees you there
[1:24:06] nothing can separate you from his love
[1:24:08] not all these trials and all these
[1:24:10] tribulations nothing that nor height nor
[1:24:12] depth nor any other creature shall be
[1:24:14] able to separate us from the love of god
[1:24:17] which is in christ jesus now let me read
[1:24:19] another scripture here and i'll see if i
[1:24:21] can and wind it down in first
[1:24:22] corinthians chapter 15 verses 35 to 38.
[1:24:27] paul's talking about how some man will
[1:24:29] say how are the dead raised up and with
[1:24:32] what body do they come
[1:24:35] and he says
[1:24:36] i wonder how how we would react if a
[1:24:39] minister would have talked to us like
[1:24:40] this that fool
[1:24:43] that which thou sowest is not quickened
[1:24:45] except it die
[1:24:47] and that which thou sow us thou sowest
[1:24:50] not that body that shall be
[1:24:53] but bare grain it may chance of wheat or
[1:24:55] of some other grain in other words he's
[1:24:57] saying if you if you go out and you try
[1:24:59] to plant a wheat plant the body of the
[1:25:02] plant in the ground that doesn't even
[1:25:04] make any sense
[1:25:06] you plant the seed and then from that
[1:25:08] seed comes forth the body
[1:25:10] you plant the seed in the ground and the
[1:25:12] body comes up
[1:25:13] but god and and that which thou sow was
[1:25:15] not that thou sow is not that body that
[1:25:17] shall be but bear grain it may chance of
[1:25:19] wheat or some other grain but god giveth
[1:25:22] it a body as it hath pleased him
[1:25:24] and to every seed
[1:25:26] his own body
[1:25:28] so the seed is what produces the body
[1:25:32] the seed of a plant will produce the
[1:25:34] wheat plant of a wheat plant will
[1:25:35] produce the wheat the seed the acorn
[1:25:37] will produce an oak tree and if you
[1:25:40] plant the seed the word of god in your
[1:25:43] heart it will produce a word body on the
[1:25:46] inside
[1:25:51] god giveth it a body as it has pleased
[1:25:53] him and to every seed his own body now
[1:25:58] now your carnal natural body was
[1:26:00] produced
[1:26:01] by that seed the wrong seed hybrid seed
[1:26:06] but the word body the inc it was
[1:26:08] produced by an incorruptible seed let's
[1:26:11] go on to read there is one glory of the
[1:26:14] sun and another glory of the moon and
[1:26:15] another glory of the stars for one star
[1:26:18] different from another star in glory so
[1:26:20] also is the resurrection of the dead
[1:26:22] it is sown in corruption
[1:26:24] because you come
[1:26:26] from adam and eve's transgression you
[1:26:29] were sown you came from your mama and
[1:26:31] daddy and it is raised in incorruption
[1:26:35] now what could be more incorruptible
[1:26:38] than the pure gospel preached what could
[1:26:40] be more incorruptible then let's put it
[1:26:43] like this the end time message that you
[1:26:45] were so your natural body is sown in
[1:26:48] corruption but this body on the inside
[1:26:51] is sown by you receiving the word for
[1:26:55] your day
[1:26:56] and the word for your day is actually
[1:26:58] what produces
[1:26:59] this mansion
[1:27:01] it is sown in dishonor it is raised in
[1:27:03] glory
[1:27:04] it is sown in weakness
[1:27:06] it's sown in weakness and tribulation
[1:27:08] and trouble and all the things that
[1:27:10] david and joseph and all those all the
[1:27:12] things that we go through in life
[1:27:14] but it is raised in power
[1:27:17] what kind of power the gospel power a
[1:27:20] gospel life the light of this end time
[1:27:23] message
[1:27:24] listen there is power in this word to
[1:27:26] transform you and make you act different
[1:27:29] than the way that the world acts
[1:27:31] that's the kind of power that bring that
[1:27:34] is brought by the incorruptible seed
[1:27:37] word of god and he says in verse 44 it
[1:27:40] has sown a natural body
[1:27:42] it is raised a spiritual body because
[1:27:46] the word seed is what produces a
[1:27:49] spiritual body there is a natural body
[1:27:52] and there is a spiritual body and in
[1:27:55] verse 49 he says as we have borne the
[1:27:57] image of the earthy
[1:27:59] in this natural body that's right we
[1:28:01] shall also bear the image
[1:28:04] of the heavenly right
[1:28:07] y'all doing all right for a few more
[1:28:09] minutes
[1:28:11] i hear a lot of amens and i see a lot of
[1:28:13] sleepy eyes
[1:28:15] brother
[1:28:19] we don't have an afternoon service so
[1:28:20] i'll just go for a little bit longer
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:24] now now brother rem see see see we're
[1:28:26] going from an earthly tabernacle
[1:28:29] from an earthly body
[1:28:31] and listen if all this is a little bit
[1:28:33] too much or whatever i encourage you
[1:28:35] again go back and listen to things that
[1:28:37] are to be things that ought to be is
[1:28:39] such a profound wonderful message and
[1:28:42] just go just put that tape on and listen
[1:28:44] to it he says this one this body this
[1:28:46] earthly carnal tabernacle has lust and
[1:28:49] sickness and death
[1:28:52] but we're going
[1:28:53] he said oh but the other one the other
[1:28:55] one is called
[1:28:57] my father's house
[1:28:59] he's gone to prepare a place a perfect
[1:29:01] place
[1:29:02] where no evil exists no sickness exists
[1:29:04] no old age exists no death exists it's a
[1:29:08] perfect place calling you to that
[1:29:10] perfection
[1:29:12] and you have to be perfect to get there
[1:29:14] and that's what stumbles a lot of people
[1:29:16] i've heard so many young people and
[1:29:18] different ones that how can i be perfect
[1:29:20] i can never come to perfection in this
[1:29:22] life because you're looking at it as
[1:29:24] though you've got to
[1:29:26] you you got to in your own by your own
[1:29:28] actions and things you've got to come to
[1:29:30] this place of where you don't you don't
[1:29:32] never trip and fall and you don't you
[1:29:34] don't never
[1:29:35] you know do anything or you don't
[1:29:36] everything any kind of bad thought about
[1:29:38] somebody
[1:29:40] you see he's
[1:29:42] your perfection your righteousness is a
[1:29:45] product of what god did for you on the
[1:29:47] cross
[1:29:48] he died for you on the cross so that
[1:29:50] he's not looking at you even anymore
[1:29:52] he's looking at what he did and so
[1:29:55] you're covered over by the shed blood we
[1:29:57] were talking about you remember brother
[1:29:59] brown used to talk about pat tyler the
[1:30:01] uh he used to be the old mobster and
[1:30:03] live the life of sin and i i'm pretty
[1:30:05] sure he even killed people
[1:30:07] when he was in the mob mob and
[1:30:08] everything
[1:30:10] and my brother told me one time he said
[1:30:12] that pat tyler would polish his hand
[1:30:14] with baby oil until he could hide a pair
[1:30:16] of dice in his hand and he would he
[1:30:18] would come up to you and toss out two
[1:30:20] pair of dice that were red and he would
[1:30:21] say once my sins were scarlet and he
[1:30:24] would take those dice back into his hand
[1:30:26] where he had polished him into a hall of
[1:30:27] his hand and they would throw out
[1:30:29] another pair they had hidden in there
[1:30:30] that were white and he said but now they
[1:30:32] are white as snow and you think about
[1:30:34] what god can do to a old mobster like
[1:30:36] that that turn somebody and just
[1:30:38] transform their life around because
[1:30:41] because that's the a product of the shed
[1:30:43] blood of jesus christ that when the
[1:30:45] blood is the pride applied to your life
[1:30:48] he he transforms you and changes you and
[1:30:51] that is what makes you perfect how could
[1:30:53] how could a murderer or somebody
[1:30:55] somebody that's lived a life of sin how
[1:30:56] could you be made perfect
[1:30:58] all the things that we've done if we go
[1:31:00] back in all of our lives and look at all
[1:31:02] the transgressions but it's what he has
[1:31:04] done not what we have done he's the one
[1:31:07] that's covered us over by his blood and
[1:31:09] he's the one that he's looking at that
[1:31:12] blood atonement he's not even looking at
[1:31:14] you all he can hear is your voice crying
[1:31:16] back to him father forgive me father
[1:31:18] forgive those that wrong me here's your
[1:31:20] voice and he's not even looking at the
[1:31:22] things that that you've done
[1:31:25] you were we were talking about um how
[1:31:27] you know the bible says righteous lot
[1:31:29] but look at all the
[1:31:31] the nonsense that rod pulled throwing
[1:31:33] his own daughters out there and said
[1:31:35] they never lived with any man and and
[1:31:37] look at abraham that righteous abraham
[1:31:39] whose righteous his faith was counted
[1:31:41] for righteousness but yet he tried to
[1:31:43] give his wife away to the king twice
[1:31:46] and all these things and you see because
[1:31:48] god is looking he's looking at your
[1:31:51] faith and what he has already done
[1:31:54] don't get don't get tripped up on what
[1:31:56] you've done if you've done something
[1:31:57] wrong if you've made a mistake then just
[1:31:59] ask god to forgive you and trust that
[1:32:02] he's looking at what he you look at what
[1:32:04] he's done because that's what that's
[1:32:05] what he's looking at
[1:32:07] and brother brahma said they see there's
[1:32:09] the father's house that he's going to
[1:32:10] prepare this one come by sex and from
[1:32:13] the fall and must fall with the fall no
[1:32:15] matter how much you patch the old thing
[1:32:18] up she's going to fall anyhow she's done
[1:32:20] because she's doomed because god said so
[1:32:23] she is finished god is going to destroy
[1:32:26] it he said so there'll be a renovation
[1:32:28] of the whole thing
[1:32:30] you believe that now that sounds like
[1:32:32] he's saying that god is going to destroy
[1:32:34] this flesh
[1:32:35] and that's where all these doctrines
[1:32:36] come about we're going to walk out on
[1:32:38] the ashes of our own our body and all
[1:32:40] these kind of things
[1:32:42] let's see in this message if you just
[1:32:44] pay attention just read a little bit
[1:32:45] further he flips to talking about that
[1:32:49] to talking about the future home about
[1:32:50] how your soul was cleansed by the holy
[1:32:52] ghost and fire how you went from a
[1:32:55] process of justification sanctification
[1:32:57] to baptism in the holy ghost and the
[1:32:59] holy oaston fire burned out all the
[1:33:01] uncleanness in your heart and
[1:33:03] transformed it and now you're going
[1:33:05] through you're going through a higher
[1:33:07] form of that
[1:33:09] justification it's a statue of a perfect
[1:33:11] man baptism of the holy ghost and fire
[1:33:13] the true token in your life and that
[1:33:15] holy ghost and fire cleanses you out
[1:33:17] cleanses your spirit out and then then
[1:33:20] you go through it again to cleanse your
[1:33:22] body out to transform your body not to
[1:33:24] give you a new body but to take that
[1:33:26] body and transform it by the holy ghost
[1:33:29] and fire you see he's saying this body's
[1:33:31] got to be demolished was your soul
[1:33:34] demolished
[1:33:35] was this earth demolished will this
[1:33:37] earth be demolished when the fire comes
[1:33:39] and cleanses it off it'll be a new
[1:33:41] heaven and a new earth but it'll be
[1:33:43] because it's been cleansed by the holy
[1:33:45] ghost and fire just the way that your
[1:33:47] soul is cleansed just the way that your
[1:33:50] body would be cleansed by the holy ghost
[1:33:52] and fire coming in and cleaning it off
[1:33:56] and he said
[1:33:58] oh my
[1:34:00] god
[1:34:04] he's talking about see there's a birth
[1:34:05] taking place to birth us into that other
[1:34:07] world to birth us into a place and and
[1:34:09] if you're hungry your father will feed
[1:34:11] you he gave us his word so that he could
[1:34:13] be with us and he said therefore
[1:34:16] if you've tonight tonight just come say
[1:34:18] i offer jesus christ my life let's go
[1:34:20] ahead and close on this i i've kept you
[1:34:22] for a little bit a while so i'm gonna go
[1:34:24] ahead and close on this he said the
[1:34:25] musicians can go ahead and come he said
[1:34:27] therefore if you tonight just come say i
[1:34:29] offered jesus christ my life and you
[1:34:32] never receive the holy ghost come into
[1:34:33] it you must do it you must grow into it
[1:34:37] ask god to pile word on top of word like
[1:34:40] that until you become the full stature
[1:34:42] of a son of god or a daughter of god the
[1:34:46] full stature he gave us his word so that
[1:34:49] he could be with us and my there's so
[1:34:51] many other wonderful things i i i i fear
[1:34:55] i fear today that there are many people
[1:34:57] that are sitting in message churches
[1:34:59] that don't get in to find those little
[1:35:01] nuggets that are in these messages if
[1:35:03] you would sit down and just pay
[1:35:05] attention to the things that brother
[1:35:06] branham is saying listen to this message
[1:35:08] and modern events made it clear by
[1:35:10] prophecy and you'll have an
[1:35:11] understanding of what he's what the
[1:35:13] baptism of the holy ghost does
[1:35:16] that you grow you grow into the word
[1:35:18] that the word is actually being birthed
[1:35:21] into you as you receive the word that as
[1:35:23] you feed you are becoming the word
[1:35:26] and that is what gives you a home to
[1:35:28] live in when you go to the other side if
[1:35:31] you don't open the door of your heart
[1:35:32] and receive that word then you don't
[1:35:34] have a mansion to go to um when this
[1:35:36] body is it dissolves and goes away and
[1:35:40] so that's what that's why we come to
[1:35:41] church that's what we listen to the
[1:35:43] tapes it's but god is he he said i go i
[1:35:47] go to prepare a place for you and he
[1:35:49] didn't go somewhere off far he didn't go
[1:35:51] on the other side of the galaxy or some
[1:35:53] some moon way off way out on another
[1:35:55] planet but he
[1:35:57] he went so that he could come and
[1:35:59] tabernacle himself and you
[1:36:01] so that when you bring the word to him
[1:36:04] he quickens it and brings it to life
[1:36:06] he's gone to prepare a place for us
[1:36:08] but not gone he's here
[1:36:13] amen let's let's stand to our feet and
[1:36:15] just praise the lord and worship him
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:21] key of f
[1:36:25] some glad morning we shall see jesus in
[1:36:29] the air
[1:36:31] coming after you and me joy is ours to
