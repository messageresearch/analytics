TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] don't bless you this morning we're gonna look in the second Corinthians chapter 10 before we're trading last week just couple of verses here it's gonna be short and sweet this morning first first 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 says without reading all that it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ so that's what we're talking about our our thoughts and heaven mmm a right mental attitude no brother brems said a right mental attitude and I report any divine promise around will bring it to pass attitude as well as a wave as our way of thinking or we're feeling something we have the same way of thing the in the message the Africa trip report is where really round talks about the lady that was praying and he said that they had taken take another swing a lie-detector machine and it changed it and was able to measure this lady she was praying pattern day up and said enough power went out while she was praying that make the needle come around as far as it go enough power leaving that woman actually sippie's that supernatural power that called on this machine some kind of magnetic power of her prayer that was powerful enough to send a radio message 55 times around the world oh it's pretty uh pretty amazing the power the power that we have in prayer our thoughts are louder in heaven that are that are words or and proverbs 3:5 says trust in the Lord with all that heart and leading up to that own understanding Frank and you know brother they open preaching the last little while even in the in the Garden of Eden and you know brother Brown said to Eve got out from behind the word and to begin to reasoning on what was there but but if she had just stayed with the word instead of trying to reason with it and said that was her fault and you know we give you the same thing we've tried to reason on the word and up just then fortified behind the word and you know it's you know we go through trials and everything like we saw about last weekend you know but you find a script shot mine is Romans 8:28 we know that all things were gonna give to her whatever happens we know it works for you know I don't have to try to figure it out but I know somewhere along the way it we and and sometimes you know we wonder why but you know what hey I got it may not be that we find out on this side but you know are we have you know our thoughts and you know we always like to anybody I admit sir a person yet they don't like to think you know they're right or you know they think they have the best way you know because you know like at work you try to talk to people sometimes and it don't matter what it is any any simple thing but you get people that you know they don't obey us and you know you can't you can't explain anything to even though you try to you know you're trying to help them out and they think you're trying to be a know-it-all and you know our reasoning factor is as I gave illustrations last week we find out our our mental capacities not what it what it what we think it is you know we're finite God is infinite and you know in Isaiah God says my ways are not your ways my thoughts are your thoughts they said my thoughts are higher than your thoughts and and so you know we've proved that you know sometimes we we look at things and you know the brother Brent said to see in the scripture when talks about to sing means to understand and sometimes we don't even the scripture Jesus was talking about one time was talking about the the Pharisees everything saying that you know they would see but not perceived they would not understand you would think would hear but they're not actually here I mean they're hearing the words but they're not understanding what's being saying it and you know many times we're in the same situation we hear thanks but we don't to sleep we don't understand what's being said and we see things and you know years ago they had at a college they had a daughter in the dorm rooms they had all these different laws and rules about different things you couldn't could not have in your dorm room well these two young enterprising young gentlemen in college they had a microwave in their dorm room which was against the rules but they kept the microwave and the dorm runs for four years because they kept rabbit ears on the top of it and everybody coming and going does not realize that it was not a television saying we see things but we don't perceive what we're seeing and so many times you know we see things and that's what the devil wants us to focus on because you know the universe is saying that every cloud has a silver lining when we see that we don't see the silver lining we don't see God working in the situation we see the negative of it we don't see the positive and many times you know we that's what devil wants us to focus on is the things that and you know there's man that's you know has spent I guess from the beginning of time you know thinking and trying to prove things and your brother Brent said man broke into God's laboratory and figured out a lot of things and was able to do a lot of things and you know nowadays it's just about whatever man can imagine they can produce and you know he continued but you know the thing is that he fails to understand that you know I was thinking about theater dr. Crawford long and you know had the the doctor lives in Jefferson back in the 1800 a was the first one to use ether is a anesthesia to put somebody to sleep to have surgery and you know we think about what a very complex memory that was and you know it's continuing on and anybody that's ever had surgery you know you think that they have that meant you know you'd hate to have to do it like they done during the Civil War you know it was it was speed not skill that they were using them do surgery back then you know they just saw their legs off yeah you know they had a story one time with him as a man it was Ben he was assisting of a surgeon he was working on somebody's leg and the man lost his thumb while that may have lost his legs and in the midst of all of that you know what his speed you know when they started they didn't stop till they were done it just boom but you know what what a me makes me you know you think about that but you know God done that along Tommy for that Abraham was smoke around sleep and removed a real blonde before man ever got into that but yo man got into God's laboratory was able to come up with that but Jim all these things and you know brother Brett said radio and television you know it's always been here but you know all these things always were in here but you men was able to discover these things and you know all of the the things that God has done all the way through the history that we've seen God do and then man has been able to replicate that in his own finite way but you know God has already already had that power and he's already demonstrated that power and as I look what I'm doing what God's already done and you know because he eight tries to man likes to think he's more than he is you know and what's the push gone out of the way but you know brother Brown said that but man through his through his mentality through his thinking through his reasoning power say God will destroy the earth God won't destroy man they said man will destroy man man to destroy the earth but McCall's he he's able to tap into something but he's not able to harness he's not able to control it because that's not what man was designed to do man was designed to follow God and let allow God to do these but we know that's what we knew that what struck looks more to take place but you know the power that we have is not in ourselves it's in heal in many times you people want to try to hold on to things that their sales and and do things in themselves that they're not supposed to do right and you know you know through you know we have a lot of studying man has spent many years and you know thinking you know man mammal stuff you know what do we have a great men in this world you know we that people hope about is like you know Socrates and Aristotle and Pythagoras and you know all these great men these great thinkers you know and you know they they've come up with all these great laws and there's a great area of study we call it philosophy you know everybody has a philosophy about everything that goes on you know we have a philosophy about about science or economics or whatever you know everybody has their philosophy but you know the one thing that people don't realize is you can have a philosophy but there's only it only is a little bit but it's limited and you know the thing is is people like a part of a part of philosophy is logic is the study of logic and critical thinking but you know brother man was talking about you know the one thing that we have to go back to it is to have the when we when we think about critical thinking and logic and you know if you have to have a a an introduction yep you know you have to have a vote preface you know you have to have a question you have to have have something that you start with and you know the thing is as many people they think morning look at many different things in life but your brother is talking about the one thing that you had to do that was most the most logical it's take it back to the word and so many people you know we have a philosophy of this and a philosophy of that but you know God said let my word be true and every man is a liar and so you know we expect many years we have philosophies and reasoning and logic different things that you know people have spent many years trying to look at and and you know the more that man has tried to prove God wrong the more they proved him right but you know they they keep trying to I believe in the men was Carl's young the great psychologist they said one time he said we need to find him where God fits in to human society and humanity he said so we can get him out see they had psychologists you know they don't want to deal with God they want to push him to the side because see they they want all the emphasis to be on them and they think you know we've got a lot of people that want to try to solve all men's problems you know we have a lot of people that you know where they're looking for a utopia oh if you know if we can just do this if we can just do that if we can have the Democrats in power if we can have the Republicans in power if we can have this or that or you know some other kind of philosophy what makes will be better but you know one spend thousands and thousands and thousands of years and you know it's never challenged it is never going to change and then so you know it doesn't matter who we put in power who we take out of power those different things we know God's in control of all that but you know what it's never going to check why because human nature doesn't change the desire of fallen man's never won't change and so it's never one that's never going to work the way it soon it looks good on paper it's it's good when they talk about it but it never works in France and the only time we know that we know where the answer is we know that when when we're taking out of here and God comes back in a millennial then everything will be perfect then there'll be exactly the way God wanted to be but until then you know we still have the same issues and and problems that we've always had but Jill we have a lot of people have reasoning and you know brother I'm speaking in greatest battle ever fault and he was speaking of hey you've opened up her mind to reasoning and that's when the fall came in and you know we have to get away from our human reasoning and look to what God has for us and Isaiah 1:18 where it says you know come let us reason together you know many people we have a reasoning factor but my brother Brett said if we go back if you want to solve a problem then you've got to go back to where the answer is and if you you know rod Randall was talking about and contending for the faith he was talking about you know we want to look back to see what God done in the Pentecost and what he done in the beginning he said well where do we go we go back to the work to see what they had because it says it let us an attempt for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints then we need to see what they had well the only way you find that is in the word and go back and look and find out what they had and see if we look back to find out what they had deal we can contend for exactly what they had but you have to find the same place that they were after and you know many people are nervous we look for something well you have to go back to the same place the brother Bell said you know if if we want to be healed if we want to be saved he said if he ever done it for one person he said if you go back and meet the same conditions you have to come back to the same place where they were they said if you meet the same requirements that they did they said that he's obligated to do the same time and you know and so it's in its begins with our fault process and you know brother Brown was talking to a man and he was cat blues Catholic and pig you know he was talking up about me and you know brother brown I want to be Catholic and we go to hear Irish and you know brother man was talking about but you know looking at the scripture and the man said oh no we can't look at the scripture you know we don't we don't deal with this victory so well you know then there's no place to start and so the thing is is if if you're gonna have a like we say a debate to try to solve a problem try to come up with a conclusion yes sir ten more minutes but if you two minute morning but you know if you want to come to the same conclusion you have to come to this everybody has to come to the same place and start from the same place and until everybody comes to the side to start from the Word of God we can't be able to advance and so you know there's many things in in our lives and these things in that we look at the has to do with our our thoughts and our thinking and you know if we if we go back and think the right kind of thoughts I was trying to find that where brother Ernie I was trying to find that thing where brother any talked about you know he said it's your your thoughts become your words and your words become your actions and your actions become your destiny something along those lines of travel but your priorities real famous for quoting that you know Joey it starts with your way your thoughts oh one of your thoughts are and you know many times the you know the old saying is is ships don't sink because they're in the water ship sink when the water gets in England you know it's not the things that happened to us that we see that surround us it's the things that we allow to get inside there are thorough mind your brother Rob said that was the the greatest battle ever fought was in the mind and that's the same battle we fight today and you know it starts with our our intent your brother wings when we can but you know it starts with all right what is that what is our intentions you know we have a and our in our court system you make this a lot of people that get in trouble with us but the thing when you go to court you can get there certain there's certain crimes that you have to prove the person's intent to convey front but then you know there's other crimes they don't have to prove you're in T they just didn't they just show that you've done something if they arrest you for trespassing they don't have to prove that you have it if the sign says no trans fats in your their location and you know but you know there's other crimes they have to prove your intent map to others
