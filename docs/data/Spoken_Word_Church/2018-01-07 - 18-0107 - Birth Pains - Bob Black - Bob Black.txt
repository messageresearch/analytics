========================================

all right all right the MP nanaia children but a national and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of Hosts in Shiloh and the two sons of Eli hophni and Phinehas the priests of the Lord were they the time was a worthy portion for he loved him but the Lord had shut up and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the Lord so she provoked her therefore she will [Music] so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after later now I give either pre set up on a seat by post to the temple of the Lord and you see a small triangle and she bowed about I said Oh Lord of Hosts if thou will indeed look on the affliction of that handmade and remember me and not forget that him me but will give unto thine handmaid a man-child then I will give him under the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head or a lie now Hannah she's faking her heart only her lips move but her voice was not hurt therefore heal I thought she had been broken and I answer that said no my lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but it poured out my soul before out of the abundance of non-compliant and greed open everything then Eli answered and said yo and then the God of Israel grant deed occupation that now has asked of him and she said my man my vibration outside a woman today and her countenance and they rose up in the morning early and worship before the Lord and returned and came to the house to their house to Rama and elkanah knew to pana has a wife and the Lord remember and the man L comma and all his house went up to offer and the Lord the yearly sacrifice his valve [Music] [Music] and elkanah her husband said under do what seemeth thee good tarry until that I've weaned him only the Lord establishes water so the woman abode and make her son suck until she waited and brought the child to Eli for this child I prayed and the Lord has given me my petition which I has to be there [Music] what I want to talk about today because you can that's maybe I know a little scripture to read about this because if you see home you've got a story of of this this man with two wives and one of them has children and she's kind of you know there were other ones looking at her I don't want to have a child and she's going through all the process of sorrow and everything and grieving and wanting to know why my child hasn't come forth and and and that's kind of what we're going through and you know what you if you go back and read the message birth pains that brother Ram preached and then a lot of the sermons after that he talks about how that you can see the the time in the state of where you are by looking at the birth pangs you look at the state of the world system and all the things that are growing in the world and you can see the contractions of nature the things that are happening in nature that like war or war on - you know something that's got to be taking place you can see the World Council of Churches coming together it's all moving and so you can see down through the seven church ages that he kind of switches and he starts talking about in the Old Testament all the the Old Testament prophets every time they would come on the singing they've caused a pain a struggle because the people would be caught up in their other creeds and dogmas of the things that they thought were true and then a prophet and create a contraction right and all these contractions during through the Old Testament until finally John came on the scene and he introduced the word and the word which is what the where the whole process is producing the word finally the word came on the scene and then in a New Testament every every Church age a messenger will come upon scene and preach a message and and are these contractions would happen because Paul would come up on the scene and all the Israelites would say well well that's I don't know about that it caused all this trouble and Oh trumpet would sound and it create a a big disturbance then all the way down through the seven church ages and and you can see the hour in the time that you're living in by looking at what's whatever what the contractions are how hard they are what the state of of everything is and it ended in the seven churches and in your own life because a birth is a struggle Bertha's is painful and that sorrow is and there's a lot of it's a lot of while I was going on it can seem like it's a bad time so you know look at this little story of Hannah that how she was uh she was crying out to God for to see to see this child come into being and then he was born and she gave him over dinner to to she gave him over to the Lord and the Lord turned sangil's life into just a testimony he was you know kind of the he was really the word for that that day that a man been to come out on the scene and began to preach to the people to to bring deliver us to the people and that they could look to have understanding of what the word was all about and and and so all these types in the in the Bible that's where someone cried out for a child are really presented these people are living out the visual stories so that we would have understanding in this day or what we're what we're crying in heaven when you know is it's it's almost kind of difficult technically to talk about birth pains because you when you talk about a birth we're talking about the new birth course but it's also talking about the birth of the word and this age that crowning the head stone the head coming forth being born and so when you talk about that the birth your talk weakens we're going to talk about both kind of simultaneously the new birth and birth of when you and I'm gonna I'm planning to go kind of through Romans chapter eight work you come forth crying Abba Father and you grow you keep moving through this process of a birth so I pretty much told you where I'm going so I hope we're on the same page now and for a little bit because we're the birth is is is to produce the word and we want to see that child come forth that's also kind of difficult to talk about too because it's really this child is not a child it's a it's a grown man right when this when this comes complete this when you're born here you're your little baby crying Abba Father grows up and there's a birth birth all the way up being born again by the incorruptible seed until the word comes forth King being completeness right so we talked about Hannah crying out as Abraham and Isaac crying out crying out for that believing that that promised son would come forth until one day he was delivered after you'd waited twenty years and finally he saw the promised son and Isaac fill all those different types and everything and then then you keep going down Isaac came children which is what good round talked about in the birth pains that eventually he had two children Jacob and Esau and Jacob and Esau or what be or what are being birthed in this day Emma because you've got twins in areas you got twin that's right Jesus and Judas and Abel and Cain and our birth is always going to produce twins and that's how close it is I know yeah stable track birth is really what the reason is is there's so much sorer and this is really because the birth was gonna messed up from the beginning instead of coming the way we should have in genesis seeing God in the picture man took Kate from their own trees they were talking about in by Allstate last night a tape from carnal ideas that the things that Satan injected and then that produced this this it produced a situation where goddess birthing us out of the things of this world from the carnal into eternity which interested 3:16 of the woman is there not a greater multiply life sorrow on that conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so that's all part of this the same curse situation that we're in when you born again it's going to be a sorrowful thing I think you know what one of the things that was trying to prevent the word from coming to pass he's trying to prevent this Berta and he's trying to keep he wants to one of the sections of this day I believe it is to keep people from going through this sorrowful time like for example he tried to he tried to get Jesus to not go through turn-turn this bread and to turn these stones into bread you know just cast yourself down from the temple in herb I see real quick that a year who you say you are to bypass the sorrow you can't bypass the sorrow and and obviously being a Christian sometime any times as sorrow people will say stuff about you people do things that are hurtful and all that and and and another thing that sorrowful is just the process of coming out of your own creeds and ideas and you know you look around you can see a lot of the young people in this church kind of going through that process now if you talk to them they're theirs they're beginning to struggle with is that going through the same things that I struggle with when I young person I you know you become to this place where you're like this is this message true I've heard about it I've heard them talk about it everything but what makes this message different than a denomination because it looks like a lot of people are good people out there what what makes this different and so all of those things are it's a process of coming out and it's it's painful amen and that works sorrow if you look it up in the Strong's Concordance it means pain labor or our chips hora toil sorrow toil going on a pain hurt offence hardship and and what a birth really is if you look at it looking like this little picture of a womb where we're kind of in a compare this to the situation we're currently in we're walking around kind of in darkness not really having a full understanding of what's going on in our present condition also before you're born again you're in a in a dark dark world and the word is what's taking you from that transforming you from that darkness into light so if you look a little baby in his mama's tummy it's it goes through this this period of nine months there's a time to set in stone right you know everybody really they've got a time allotted to their life you don't know how much time that God has given you but you have a set amount of time that you here on on earth which is why the Bible says redeem the time because you want to make you want to maximize the time that you're given here on earth because you want to maximize the time to make to make a fish as efficient as possible during process we should be giving everything that we have everything we are to God so that he can make his word manifest in us because just like in this little room the God is transforming us to take us from darkness into light it's like a metamorphosis you might not be able to really see it if you're looking at just a woman's belly or a woman walking down the street this pregnant something on the inside of her is going on and then she yes it's true and has that as the process evolved is getting closer and closer to the time when that baby is going to come forth and and be presented to the world and what what happens when the baby is presented is that you know and like some of the old-timey movies and everything when you see a woman go into labor and and the baby is born the dads like nowhere to be seen he's out outside you know it was stress and everything but I don't believe that's how it is in the gospel you know because when a baby and the gospel is born the first thing that baby sees is the father isn't the father that's what that's what you see and that's why that's kind of what I'm getting to you because it could cry out Abba Father because you recognize who your God is and so you know the Bible teaches that that we have a mother because the Bible says that New Jerusalem is the mother of us all a New Jerusalem is the word that we're born from the word this it has to be this union that takes place that brings the birth we have to have the word and then it's very quick is it to bring life and then we're born and we come out if you come out of the womb so to speak and the first thing we see is the father and I'm getting ahead of myself in the slide and everything but I don't know where that slide here well let me talk about this then so we're going from one world to the next from one thing to the next and as you come forth from that world the father's got everything already planned for you he's got it all set up so as we go from this world to the next he's got everything planted you see this is what John 14 says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me I in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you so we know that he's preparing New Jerusalem that and a city that comes down God out of heaven but he's preparing after the new birth he's preparing he go he went so that he could prepare a place at a preparer prepare us in a growth so that we would grow up to to the word so just like a baby being born when it comes forth there's already all the little things setup all the little baby toys and everything's already set up and that's what God does for you when you're born when we're born from this world into the next everything you know like your your home over there your eternal home is program taught us that it's made according to your desires it's gonna be set up and I you know we can't even hardly imagine what it might be not even sure what my desires for a home might be but God news cuz he knows all of the all of our attributes what we want what we like everything so you know maybe one that will have a my wife always says I won't allow birds when I get over there she likes birds and she likes it look see all the birds at the bird feeder stuff so your home is gonna be prepared and so so we we come through this process of growing and struggle into life eternal so in Psalm David David had to sell a lot of these things because he you know as he was writing his songs and prophesying and so forth like in Psalms chapter six he says I'm weary with my growing all the night make out my bed to swim I water my counselor tears mine if my eyes consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of all my enemies depart from me all you workers of iniquity for the Lord I've heard the voice of my weeping why wouldn't they be growing why won't any of the Old Testament growing what are we growing in ourselves because we can't stay in this world and we're trying to get out of here and so something within you there's a dipascali to the deep to escape back excuse me to escape the shackles of this earth to get out of here I trust in Romans 8:26 27 it says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities but we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit that is self maketh intercession for us with groanings which can be uttered and he has searched the hawks knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and all these speeches scriptures that just speak of this inward turmoil is groaning to get out of here Jesus therefore again groaning in himself and this is kind of where I'm going to use it is to the the difference between crying Abba Father and crying like Jesus did at the grave of Lazarus Lazarus come forth because those are both crying and so here Jesus was standing at the tomb of Lazarus and he said he was groaning in himself groaning because because there's there's gotta before a resurrection has to come you gotta have gasps cemani you gotta have a cross and the inner resurrection can come god I have a dying out you gotta have this groaning this situation this scenario of turmoil and something pressing out the word coming forth Jesus was standing there groaning himself coming to the Greenville's a cave and a stone lay upon you just like the stone that lay on his grain and jesus said take away the stone Martha the sister of in those dead sailor and him Lord by this time he's stinking for you been dead for days and so I'm getting to Lazarus come forth that's where I'm going but not yet and so you can see a Burt birth pains are irregular contractions contractions of the of the years contractions of the earth because the what what remember what the threefold purpose was to restore fallen Eden back to his condition and you can see that having any contractions of the world system everything is coming together that all the wars all the things that were promised I'd just like just before Jesus died all these prophecies all these things that begin to be fulfilled in rapid succession because it shows that something is about to happen there's gonna be there's gonna be twins born there's gonna be a bride form and there's gonna be something the world is coming together to and he saw the world's system all of these churches coming together they're uniting just like the bride as you know this birth pains all of this us contract it can happen together to produce God's Word and now we know we are aware the earth has just went through some great birth pains but I said that if you say this is and the church is going through some birth pains if I had to go through birth pains before to give each one of the prophets when they came into the world of the birth pain to the church the world had went through a First World War Second World War and now it's ready for a third world war and then send birth pains again but there's only one thing that could be bring peace and that's Christ now see what he's getting at here these birth pains are gonna produce Christ today they're not just to produce a lot of emotion or a lot of interesting situations for us to notice but it's producing the word made manifest you know a lot of times these little feasible there's so many of these little nuggets hidden in the message and it is wonderful and all of our schemes and our ideas and our pleas ESCO buildups and all of our politics and all of our science and everything it's been proved that it's nonsense and then we pray for God to help us to intervene come in and do something for us and then when he does I just wonder if we would be able to understand it if we would be able to receive it or even would we consider it so I think especially in this hour is it behooves us to pay attention to what's happening and realize what's taking place you know many of the message for many years and we believe that God sent a prophet and everything but what was the purpose of that prophet to come back the the purpose of the Prophet was to produce the word to preach in gospel that we would grab ahold of and eat until the word has made manifest in us and that's the only thing they could bring peace is Christ is that word main Memphis and then he talks about Israel that let's follow her heed her for the next ten minutes maybe Israel had birth pains under every prophet that came to the earth she had birth pains that has a message for what did they do the Prophet had the word and she had sown so much rottenness and make so much systematic orders in her being until this prophet shook her off of her foundation they were hated by everybody so therefore when God sent a prophet the church itself went into birth pains because the Prophet the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet and him only done it that is the word that spoken for that day is made manifest by the prophet of that age always has been and the churches they build so many systems around the world until he shook her off her rocker when he come she had birth pains what was it back to the word back to the life sometimes systems doesn't have a life it's only God's Word has life the systems that's built around it where does not have life it is the word that gives life his message brought in the remnant back to the word now you see really what he's talking about there's a you look at for patterns in the scripture there's a birth pains really if you look at a labor of birth pains don't come in the first month of the of the pregnancy birth pains happen at the end so you know if you look at this you can see that as each and during each age as Paul preached this message will say that's a birth pregnant right because he preached a message and out from that age came the people who believe the the bride from that age and through a process of birth and everything but all the way up this this church is the bride has been building up until we get here right when then the headstone is going to come and that produces what the the real birth pains well there's a big of somethings the baby's fixed to be born and again it's not a baby it's a full-grown man that's right which makes it a little bit difficult to express we're not talking about a baby we're talking about a fool little man that's coming forth and so this is the Prophet comes on the scene to bring it to turn the litter turn the hearts of the children and and and on all those things and and that's what when the Prophet begins to preach his word that's that's what produces all of the struggle and turmoil everything you know you look around and all the things that are happening in the world they're they're not we get our eyes so fixated on that what Donald Trump's doing and what oh you know Israel is doing and all those things but all those are happening because there's birth pangs in the bride and the bride is producing the work and because of that all of these other things happen as a consequence yeah just like look here's another that this is the real focus is that there's a little Mary and Joseph coming down into into Bethlehem and and she's going through this process where the birth pangs begin to strike she's riding on this little donkey and and the word is being born it's ready to be born and becoming that's that's really the focus is that Jesus Christ is coming into view to be made manifest so when a baby is born it storms off by crying right it starts off by crying out Abba Father so that's what I'm going to shift into for the next a little bit but what's the first thing come water if it isn't it's a dried birth to babies not normal say think blood that right what's the next thing life would come from Jesus water blood and life which you know he talks about we know that how a baby is born you got to have those three things and the third is what really when the baby comes out is born in his mom and daddys arms might not breathe breathing or whatever give it a little whack and all sudden it takes that first breath its life comes into it if it doesn't cry if it doesn't try out then there's no life so what does that mean to cry I think that that little definition of what crying is has been so misinterpreted everything you know lately I've been involved in lots of discussion about what interpreting is you know people people that they have said that ministers i haven't-- have the right to interpret the word which you know is true nobody can interpret the word to you to give you the correct interpretation the only one that can interpret the word to you is God by Jesus when he was talking to Peter and said flesh and blood didn't reveal this to you and my father in heaven revealed this to you but yeah you'd have to hear it priest so it has the the word has to comb through the bride tree it's got to be preached so that the father can quicken it to you to reveal to you exactly what it's talking about yeah so many so many different ways of looking at things but you know God is going to bring the correct interpretation to you if your wedding that's right and I'm convinced and I'm convicted that you cannot get it without the fivefold ministry nothing convinced more than ever that in a 1954 witnesses program said someone said the other day said brother Branham you believe God by faith abraham believed God by faith and that's all you can do there's no experience with it I said oh yes my brother what more can you do that believe God that's all you can name see but abraham believed God by faith he believed God and God gave him the confirmation of his faith about the sign of circumcision and so in other words after you believe you just keep holding on believe it hang on to the word and then God will confirm it to you by clicking again putting that alive in there there's a life is what we're after the life not just a lot of understanding a lot of knowledge and all that kind of thing but the actual life the power of God and you to transform you to bring about that metamorphosis that we were looking at the little baby growing and growing and growing that maybe it's hidden from view but all of a sudden that comes into view and you know when it comes into view might catch a lot of people by surprise oh my there's there's the bride made manifest now but again on the other hand it's a secret coming it's a secret thing a secret work that is not gonna be a public show I heard somebody say recently we you know when you look on YouTube or whatever and you see all these things that are being done around the world and faith healing and whatnot that's not the that was chrislam women I think yeah that's right that was good yeah yeah that's not the third pole cuz it's gonna be soon that's right a man can't join a church or get all emotional worked up or anything else and become a Christian it's gotta be a solid birth of the Spirit sincerely dying out crying out lying there - he's dead in Christ remember life can only come out of death a grain of corn if it abides at a bottle own it will never mean no more than that one grain of corn except a corn of wheat fall on the earth it abides alone but when it falls there it rots contaminates and out of that midst of corruption comes the germ of life that gives it life and produces more so you gotta have a die now and you gotta haven't got cemani and a cross before you can have a resurrection and I think a lot of times we leave those those pieces out we we come to church and we want a good intellectual conception a republic and instead of having a real dying out where we we say you know what maybe I was wrong to begin with and we really seek God for a revelation right because a birth is going to produce this baby just crying out alive baby this crying out Romans 8:15 this is what I'm getting to bro you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and so when we cry when the baby is born is not just crying nothing like we think crying like just wow but this baby is crying Abba Father he's not just crying about something he don't know about I know now he is in baby form right so he he doesn't maybe not have the full understanding of a mature Christian that has been through some knocks and trials and hard things and has a little bad experience behind you but yeah the Word of God is being made manifest in him he's got the life in there and so he recognizes who his father is he's crying Abba Father and so when a baby is born in the gospel the first thing he sees is not not the preacher I'm not a man not somebody hit the first thing he sees is his father and that's what I believe every minister in the gospel is trying to get the people to see their father and you know what I really want to focus on this because I think so many in this day are not looking at their father they've got their eyes on brother branham or let's look at his son Joseph brain we'll just put that out there or in this church they've got their eyes on brother Dale right or way Dale or me or any of the ministries and that's not what your eyes supposed to be home right you're supposed to see your you're supposed to see your father reject and you know that's I just really wanna talk told how that that was one of the stumbling blocks that ministers were put in front of people they'll try to get people to them and they'll say look at all these gifts and all these things that I have or whatever and all the show by all the signs and wonders that are following their ministry whatever and everybody starts gravitating to that person that's what's happening now is that instead of seeing God the people are looking for some man Durazo they're looking for somebody to rise up to with some special thing or some special anointing or some new fancy doctor or something to rise up but what's going to take you in the rapture what gives you the new birth is is the father it's not it's not any particular man now of course we know the father is working through all the different ministers working through everybody and if you want to see God just like a news in the New Jerusalem if you want to see God you'll come up to remember the bride we know all those things but yet we don't follow after me and in that way where you say well I know I'm right because I go to this particular church well that that's a helpful and everything to go to a particular church but that's not what we base our salvation as we based our salvation on a personal revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you like in this picture this little baby is looking there's communion going on yeah there's something going on where it all the distractions have faded away this little baby is gazing straight into the face of his father and he might only have just a very basic understanding of what's going on here but he knows there's something happening there when you're born you begin to cry out Abba Father and it's not just some kind of vain cry and not or you don't really recourse eat but don't get me wrong you don't have a full understanding but you know you when you're born again the Bible becomes a new book because you begin to see your father unfold yes Matthew 23 892 the city they were never fired up by this he said but be not call rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are brethren and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in him you know what that means that means that there's not any man they can give you a revelation we can lay it out there so and so that you've got the building blocks for if you just open up stood it out for yourself open yourself up or like with like the doors and door open my doors a pride all those doors up so that God can come in and quicken the word that you've heard but there's no man that your father and of course we give reverence to our earthly you know the ones that have helped us the ones that the Bible says in Hebrews 13:7 have the rule over us they help us and all those things that is not what we base our salvation on and the Misses identification he said and now God expresses himself through his son Christ Jesus as he takes us and it has adopted children and that's another thing that's a little bit confusing way to say yeah you're born again but he's calling you adopted sure because you came from the things of the world you know you're a Gentile a barbarian and you were you didn't have nothing to do with Israelite faith and so he adopted you that's why this is adoption and this is a different kind you pulled in from the things of this world and you're gonna adopt it into the kingdom of God and then you begin your heavenly journey as he takes us in as adopted children and put his spirit in us crying Abba Father see or in other words remind God my god see then the Holy Spirit in us Christ's spirit expressing Jesus Christ and the people look at you the things that are to be he said we have become from mortal beings from time being an eternal beings when the Word of God in our souls and we become sons and daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God in us to be sons and daughters of the father God and heaven crying I have a father my God my god in my father's house so yeah I want to just kind of put emphasis on this because I think so many times we think that I'm gonna be born again because I just cry out or whatever because I cry within the divinity of my own mind just having no understanding of the word that's one of the deceptions of the enemies that you don't have to understand because brother Branham said just believe it you have to understand it just believe it well that's true but one day God is gonna quicken it to you you will have understanding not because you studied a lot because God revealed it to you but studying a lot is part of it's all it's all part of the process that's right you need to you need to read the Bible you need to listen to the tapes but there's many people that have listened to the tapes and and have their own carnal interpretation it must be revealed and when it's revealed to you then you'll see the father but married with that baby in our homes that didn't make any difference where they thought she knowed whose son that was and that's what I'm getting in she knows so you know who that was just like you do when he's born in you you'll know who he is and so has every believer that accepts God word in their heart I don't care what the system say I know for and so forth he says it's crying she's in travail the church is then to bring forth little ones crying my God my God see I'm a father so let's look at what the definition of this word is and I got like two minutes cry we cry and the Greek lexicon the Strong's Concordance it says and I'm gonna what I'm gonna do I'm doing is comparing this word cry we cry Abba Father to Jesus when he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth because those two words are related cry and this sense is a lesser form of cried with a loud voice they both and agree they're both people that they both come from the same root word too so this word means to cry cry out aloud speak with a loud voice and then in John 11 it says he cried with a loud voice and if you look at I thought I'd written down where I've got this from this Bible dictionary and it's a stronger form of what we just read cry crying Abba Father so it's a higher form so you're crying there's two to cries but there that one is a and more mature of state and then the other but they're both not just crying for no reason but they're speaking the word they're making a confession they're saying the same thing you see yeah and the Lord said unto Moses were for Christ and then down unto me this isn't the one we will that brother Branham talked about a why cry speak this is a different kind of cry this is crying out for help crying out and distress to make outcry clamor to be someone to cry and grief like you don't know you're in confusion you don't know what's going on you're like oh god help me but this is a different kind of cry then cry Abba Father or crying with a loud voice which is the mortar form of crying Abba Father remember we're not just crying for no reason we're crying Abba Father because you know you're beginning to see who God is and imma have to stop right there because that's that's all the time [Music]
