[16:48] just Dy laughing right now talking about
[16:51] their commodes on the internet but we
[16:54] get it all done amen that's fine with us
[16:57] okay any other announcements I generally
[16:59] miss them I know Terence has made all
[17:00] the others about the the banquet and the
[17:03] different things and if you like turning
[17:05] your scriptures turn to First
[17:06] Corinthians
[17:08] 11 and 1 Peter 3 now forgive me this
[17:13] afternoon my tro been oh sinus has been
[17:16] hitting me for a couple of days and you
[17:17] just pray cuz I've been coughing like
[17:20] crazy and you know it's one of them
[17:22] things but just pray the Lord take care
[17:25] of it and get us where we can get our
[17:27] point across
[17:29] because we're going to we're going to be
[17:31] talking for a while I don't know how
[17:34] many services but we will be talking
[17:37] about some of the
[17:39] doctrines that are floating among the
[17:41] people of the message try to bring out
[17:44] their background of where they came from
[17:47] and express why we believe maybe
[17:49] something or why we don't believe some
[17:52] of the doctrines and things and you know
[17:56] and I say to those out there on internet
[17:58] or to
[17:59] anyone
[18:01] um first off if you have any questions
[18:04] when I speak about things uh don't write
[18:07] me and ask me a question who started
[18:09] this doctorine I I'm going to try to
[18:12] stay away from calling names cuz that
[18:15] wouldn't be
[18:16] proper but if you'll send me a personal
[18:19] note I will pray about sending you back
[18:21] a note on it you know to tell you who
[18:23] that uh but most of them when we call
[18:25] the doctor and most everybody will know
[18:27] who has got the doctrines and what they
[18:29] are but uh you know if you want anything
[18:33] if you got any questions about any of
[18:34] the doctrines that you want to be
[18:37] covered if you'll write me a note I'll
[18:39] try my best to cover it the best I can
[18:41] because I want to tell you why I don't
[18:43] agree with something I want to put it in
[18:45] the Bible I want to put it in the
[18:47] prophet's message not just get up and
[18:49] say what do you believe about to so
[18:51] don't believe it question number two
[18:55] that's no answer to nobody that won't
[18:57] cover anything is just you know cuz uh
[19:00] there are a lot of people that believe
[19:02] some of those doctrines that don't
[19:03] believe like the others believe you know
[19:05] even the founders and especially don't
[19:07] live and do like some of them have done
[19:09] but now you know to do
[19:13] uh and if you hear this I'm not your
[19:17] pastor I'm not pastoring the people on
[19:20] the internet system You Know It uh
[19:23] that's that's beyond where we can do and
[19:26] by by doing that then I'm not I'm only
[19:28] HonorBound to my people here that's
[19:31] right that I'm speaking about why I
[19:32] don't agree with these things and you go
[19:35] to your pastor and you ask him about
[19:38] this and see what he believes and and
[19:40] thingss and that's your choice you know
[19:42] to do but that's it 1 Corinthians 11 and
[19:46] 1 Peter
[19:48] 3 our heavenly father Our Savior Our
[19:51] Redeemer our All In All In Jesus is your
[19:54] name thank you for all of the things
[19:56] that you've done for us in our day day
[19:58] and hour that we're living thank you
[20:00] most of all for salvation in our souls
[20:03] thank you for the word that you've given
[20:04] unto us into our hearts that we may grow
[20:07] thereby and thank you for you coming
[20:10] Among Us in many ways of Healing The
[20:12] Sick and delivering and setting us free
[20:14] Lord we pray that you would just touch
[20:17] each one there's many sicknesses Among
[20:19] Us here today Lord and we read in your
[20:22] word where it said you sent your word
[20:23] and healed us and delivered us from
[20:25] destruction so all we're asking you to
[20:27] do is manifest your word have your way
[20:30] Lord if I say something here I will be
[20:33] trying to listen and make sure that I
[20:36] speak according to
[20:38] what I believe and why I believe it that
[20:40] way and if there's anything that's wrong
[20:42] Lord then you just count it to my
[20:44] ignorance cuz I don't I don't want to be
[20:46] and I don't want to be contrary to
[20:47] people I love everybody and I want
[20:49] everybody to to be helped and guided and
[20:53] Lord just let your love be there it's
[20:56] not that we've always been so straight
[20:58] and everybody else has been so wrong
[21:01] Lord but we've all been in a category
[21:03] put together that we're growing in you
[21:06] and we just ask you Lord to have your
[21:08] way now and guide us forgive our sins
[21:11] most of all and keep us in Jesus name
[21:15] amen 1
[21:17] Corinthians
[21:19] 11
[21:20] 18 we go to verse 18 and
[21:25] 19 for first of all when you come
[21:28] together in the church I hear that there
[21:29] be divisions among you and I partly
[21:31] believe it now watch for there must be
[21:35] also hes among you why that they which
[21:40] are approved may be made manifest among
[21:43] you that's right all right now that's
[21:46] that's simple and plain isn't it there
[21:49] must need to be heresies there will be
[21:51] heresies there got to be because Satan
[21:52] will send them all right but what is to
[21:54] do the prophet said is to try us to see
[21:57] if we'll stay with the word right all
[21:59] right so you know it's wonderful for him
[22:02] to allow these things to happen but we
[22:04] don't say wonderful because of the
[22:06] people that is happening in no sir all
[22:08] right verse uh 1 Peter 3 and verse1
[22:12] 15 said but sanctify the Lord in your
[22:15] hearts and be ready always to give an
[22:17] answer to every man that ask you a
[22:20] reason of the hope that is in you with
[22:23] meekness and fear you may be seated the
[22:26] Lord at is bless ing to the reading of
[22:29] the word
[22:32] now we've done this over periods of time
[22:36] and things and we you know kind of felt
[22:38] like it the other day maybe praying some
[22:41] when we were out in in the Alabama
[22:44] hunting and didn't do much getting the
[22:46] deer but I could listen to a lot of
[22:48] tapes and just sat there for 3 or 4
[22:50] hours morning 3 or 4 and afternoon you
[22:53] got a lot of times to meditate and you
[22:55] know to think on things and we've got
[22:57] some new Among Us that you know we can
[22:59] say well I don't believe in this well
[23:02] you know they want to know maybe why you
[23:04] don't believe in it because maybe
[23:05] they've been taught that and they might
[23:07] think it's true right all right and then
[23:10] uh the fact is that uh it always helps
[23:14] all of us
[23:16] to uh review in our minds and things
[23:20] about the the message to where that we
[23:24] can um feel assured that we have the
[23:27] right answer the Bible says examine
[23:29] yourself right to see whether you be in
[23:31] the faith or not all right so then the
[23:34] way to do that is by the word so then
[23:37] we're not picking on people right you
[23:39] know it is not the people that I'm
[23:41] against the prophet said it's the system
[23:43] or the fact of people taking those
[23:46] doctrines and ideas and they're honest
[23:48] hearted people that are in them and you
[23:51] know they have affected all of
[23:54] us I say that because a lot of times
[23:57] people don't really know when they say
[23:59] well I believe so and so and then when
[24:02] you express to them what that so and so
[24:04] amounts to well then they'll be like I
[24:07] was when brother Mo asked me what I
[24:09] believed and I said I believe in one
[24:11] true and living God I believe in God in
[24:13] three persons Blessed Trinity he said
[24:15] that's trinitarian so you know he
[24:17] straightened me out in a hurry well you
[24:20] know sometimes we have to
[24:22] tell what we believe before we can uh
[24:26] get helped right and that's the way it
[24:28] is and I've just always been blunt to do
[24:31] and I've studied all of these basics of
[24:33] the doctrines when it comes out because
[24:35] especially being Pastor you know that's
[24:38] being Pastor I believe that I'm Duty
[24:41] bound to know of these things so I've
[24:44] listened to some of the brothers and as
[24:46] many as 10 11 tapes or something like
[24:49] that from somebody and I don't listen
[24:52] you know where did he miss that where
[24:53] did he miss that quot know and I don't
[24:56] boy I'll straighten him out when see him
[24:58] I don't do that and I'm honest I've
[25:00] always tried to be that way I listen to
[25:03] see what they're saying right I listen
[25:06] more to the sincerity of their heart
[25:09] right right than I do anything else and
[25:12] I got some wonderful brothers friends
[25:14] out there that I count Brothers you know
[25:18] and and you know I don't disrespect them
[25:21] but I too want to take a stand for what
[25:23] I believe and tell you why I believe it
[25:26] that way in that way you know that would
[25:28] good and we just got to
[25:30] covering what is the new birth and and
[25:33] we went through so that can be uh added
[25:36] into this series if you'd like right as
[25:38] to you know there's a lot of controversy
[25:40] about the New Birth whether it's this
[25:42] whether it's that whether it's this that
[25:44] and I hope we tried to cover it enough
[25:46] to be able to at least tell you what we
[25:49] I believe and then you we can go from
[25:52] that point now you say but Brother D you
[25:54] say someone so beli it are the Lost no I
[25:56] didn't say that that's right right now
[25:58] if you putting that to my statements
[26:00] you're you're messing things up you know
[26:04] I said it you and all of us were messed
[26:06] up amen and we needed somebody to help
[26:09] us Y and you know the best thing to do
[26:11] the prophet of God said he said like I
[26:14] said about there must needs to be heres
[26:16] among you brother Rand said God would
[26:18] allow these things to come Among Us
[26:21] right that's right even send an
[26:23] anointing and even things would happen
[26:27] upon the you know the people has to try
[26:30] you and
[26:31] I to see whether or not we're in the
[26:35] faith well so they must needs be it's
[26:37] not that they might be or maybe they
[26:40] will it's it must be in other words it's
[26:42] going to be amen God knew before the
[26:44] world that he was going to allow these
[26:46] things to take place and even honor them
[26:49] to the basis of sending healings and
[26:52] signs and I've always told you this much
[26:55] I believe it now I believe when the this
[26:57] thing winds
[26:59] down that according to the prophet he
[27:02] said God will anoint a church right and
[27:04] he'll do in one year what theologist
[27:06] tried to do in 2000 but said he's doing
[27:08] it now all right now I believe that when
[27:12] the anointing strikes home to the
[27:15] Bride of that final quickening to go
[27:18] away of the bride all
[27:21] right I believe all of those that out
[27:24] there that are under doctrines and
[27:26] things that that there'll be an
[27:28] anointing strike them and they'll be
[27:30] saying I tried to tell you I right yeah
[27:33] y I'm sorry I believe that he said well
[27:36] what hope does that give me that gives
[27:38] us only hope in one thing right whether
[27:40] or not we do like I've tried to preach
[27:42] this morning whether or not the spirit
[27:45] in US agrees with the
[27:47] word whether or not we can believe the
[27:50] word not what somebody said the word
[27:52] said now what somebody said brother
[27:54] random said
[27:56] yes but whether or not the spirit in us
[27:59] can agree because that's always been the
[28:01] evidence to each Church age that said he
[28:04] that hear Let Him hear what the spirit
[28:07] sath unto the churches so it's always
[28:09] been the hearing by the Holy Spirit even
[28:11] the day of Pentecost was the hearing yes
[28:15] like I said this morning you got him in
[28:16] the upper room it doesn't mention it
[28:18] mentions what took place there but then
[28:20] you got to separated the prophet did
[28:22] when they were outside and the 3,000
[28:24] heard them that was quite a time even if
[28:26] it' been 5 minutes it was the time right
[28:28] and these out here is hearing them
[28:29] speaking tongues so then you know
[28:33] separated in the right order I believe
[28:34] in speaking in G amen I believe in all
[28:37] the manifestations of God shouting
[28:39] seeing visions dreams prophecies all in
[28:43] if it's in God I believe in cuz I
[28:44] believe in the nine spiritual gifts
[28:46] right but I believe the gifts without
[28:49] the virtue the prophet said is a
[28:51] stumbling block right all right so I
[28:54] don't want to be in a stumbling block
[28:55] position I want to be ready against that
[28:58] day okay
[29:01] now
[29:03] Paul found in his
[29:06] day you know the time that he was here
[29:11] doctrines that he did not agree with and
[29:14] and he had to approach that subject I'm
[29:17] not making ourselves or anything like
[29:19] that in where Paul was but just making
[29:22] us the pastor or Shepherd of the flock
[29:25] right that you know we don't have the
[29:28] ability and I wouldn't want the ability
[29:30] but see Paul had the ability according
[29:32] to 1 Corinthians
[29:34] 1513 that some said there's no
[29:37] Resurrection well he had the ability to
[29:39] call them men
[29:41] in and he had ability to release them to
[29:44] the Lord right you know he done that to
[29:48] Philipus and hus I believe the two names
[29:50] are you know why because they were
[29:52] saying what they thought he said right
[29:55] that's it and that's how simple it is to
[29:57] be in heresy Paul was teaching a phys a
[30:01] spiritual Resurrection inside of us rais
[30:05] sitting together in Heavenly places in
[30:07] Christ Jesus Philipus and hus took it
[30:09] over to the Natural and said the
[30:11] resurrection done took place right now
[30:14] they took it from Paul right so Paul had
[30:17] the ability or the authority to call in
[30:20] those
[30:21] brothers and do that now because he was
[30:25] the messenger of that time all right now
[30:27] now we're not we're not concerned about
[30:29] it I'm not wanting to you know call in
[30:31] somebody and say bless God will just
[30:33] commit all them to the devil no we're
[30:34] not going to do nothing we're just going
[30:36] to try to cover doctrines and say okay
[30:40] this is why we don't agree with it right
[30:43] and then just going down the road you
[30:45] know and things of that order and
[30:47] there's wonderful brothers like I've
[30:49] said that you know are are out there
[30:52] that are called in doctrines right you
[30:54] know and just you know just pray for
[30:56] them that's all
[30:57] do all right we'll start off with one of
[31:00] the oldest major
[31:03] doctrines and we'll try to cover some of
[31:05] the things this was one of the major
[31:07] ones that you would a lot of you would
[31:09] be Associated into the time it was
[31:12] called Two
[31:14] Souls all right it was started by a man
[31:17] up here and accredited two or three
[31:20] different ones but there's only one man
[31:22] that really started it and and I say
[31:25] this folks listen
[31:27] just because somebody comes along and
[31:29] said they believe in Two
[31:31] Souls uh they might not believe it the
[31:33] way that yeah the originator started it
[31:37] and especially they would not live the
[31:39] way he did because he wound up with
[31:42] young girls and everything in the world
[31:44] you know uh messed up all right but
[31:48] that's between him and the Lord on his
[31:50] part but a lot of people are caught in
[31:52] doctrines that really don't realize that
[31:54] they they believe that righten yep
[31:57] that's right and then when you say
[31:59] something they say well that's what I
[32:01] believed then you say well now this is
[32:03] why that we don't agree with it well
[32:06] then you go off and puff up you you know
[32:09] get yourself all PFI and everything else
[32:12] and go off mad because you think
[32:14] somebody straightened you out well thank
[32:15] God for the
[32:17] truth there was a dumb donkey
[32:19] straightened the prophet out one
[32:21] day and I imagine that old Prophet from
[32:24] then on felt pretty good about that old
[32:26] boy he probably fed a little extra and
[32:28] took care of him because he realized he
[32:30] saved his life you know all right so you
[32:33] know we could maybe we could do that but
[32:36] many years ago there was a man started a
[32:38] Doctrine and called Two Souls knew the
[32:41] man personally sat down talked with him
[32:43] and just told him that I couldn't see
[32:45] what he's talking about and uh you
[32:48] know but there's many flings off from
[32:52] that Doctrine right and the reason I'm
[32:54] using this one is because you will see
[32:58] that once we cover this Doctrine we can
[33:00] go into other doctrines of the message
[33:02] people and you'll see that they have the
[33:05] same
[33:06] basis it's like all
[33:10] denominations it's got the basis of the
[33:13] Trinity all right then you come over to
[33:15] the Oneness side then all the Oneness
[33:19] has got the basis of the Oneness
[33:22] Doctrine you agree you know that's just
[33:24] the what they are and like we were're
[33:27] talking the other day I think brother
[33:29] Donnie and I were talking about it but
[33:31] uh a man used to go to church with us
[33:34] here he he was in a Baptist Church and
[33:37] he he he asked the pastor one day
[33:40] something about you know what did the
[33:43] Baptist believe and the old preacher
[33:46] which he was a personal friend of mine I
[33:48] worked with him but he uh he said well
[33:51] I'm going to teach him the Baptist
[33:53] Doctrine and he for two or 3 weeks he
[33:56] took the doctrine of the Baptist Church
[33:57] you know and explained it to the
[33:59] congregation but when before he started
[34:01] he said how many here understand the
[34:02] Baptist Doctrine but and agree with it
[34:04] would this maybe a few hands went up you
[34:06] know he said well I'm going to just take
[34:07] the Baptist doctorine and explain it so
[34:10] he took two or 3 weeks to explain it
[34:12] when he got through he said how many
[34:13] here raise your hand believe what the
[34:15] Baptist Doctrine there was less than
[34:17] what there was to start with that raised
[34:18] their hands because they didn't really
[34:20] know what it was and you know yourself
[34:23] that unless you you know were something
[34:25] trying to maybe approve PR or something
[34:28] that you didn't know the doctrine of the
[34:29] church you come from right you just went
[34:32] to
[34:33] church well see it's easy to do that in
[34:35] the message people yes sir just go to a
[34:38] church find a good bunch of people and
[34:41] and you know and just sat down and well
[34:44] what do we believe we were going to a u
[34:47] a fellowship meeting one time and this
[34:49] sister and brother was with us and and
[34:53] she turned around to her husband and
[34:54] since i' said something and she's turned
[34:56] around to the husband and she said
[34:58] something about do we agree with that he
[35:01] said no we didn't believe it that way
[35:04] she thought she did just because I said
[35:06] it you know you say predestination a
[35:09] presbyterian rais his hand badst cuz
[35:12] they believed in that but what are all
[35:14] of the problems and the things of
[35:17] explaining it may come out to a lot of
[35:20] different things all right but with all
[35:21] that doing
[35:23] now here's what I believe and I'm tell
[35:27] to my conclusion and I did
[35:29] listen to these if I tell you I listen
[35:32] to them you can back on I did but if I
[35:35] didn't never do it then I'll tell you I
[35:37] never listened to that but I've heard
[35:38] what other people said right all right
[35:41] but see like I said I met the man
[35:43] personally and brother collie brother Dy
[35:45] met him and uh you know sat down and
[35:47] listen to him talk about the things and
[35:50] uh as as it was doing they begin to
[35:53] explain you know that you had two Souls
[35:56] all right now the basic teaching of Two
[36:01] Souls is that if you were able to be
[36:06] redeemed see a lot of you probably heard
[36:08] two soul doctr but don't even know what
[36:09] in the world it was or whatever the
[36:11] basics of the doctrine was that if you
[36:14] were able to be redeemed if you would
[36:16] ever be redeemed you had two
[36:18] Souls but if you were not going to be
[36:20] ever redeemed you only had
[36:25] one now and the doctrine was
[36:29] that if you had the two Souls if you had
[36:32] the one Soul it' come from
[36:36] Satan see you see his children then that
[36:39] would go into the serpent seeds and the
[36:42] doctrinal isues and that's what it said
[36:43] all slings off of different things of
[36:46] people believing it all
[36:49] right but see then they would say that
[36:51] if you were able to be redeemed or a
[36:53] seed you know predestinated person
[36:57] you had two
[36:58] souls and they said one of them come
[37:00] from God the other one come from the
[37:03] devil and that was why it was called Two
[37:06] Souls but that's the basis now that they
[37:08] believed you if you were redeemable you
[37:10] had two Souls if you wouldn't redeemable
[37:13] you never had but
[37:14] one cuz you just come from the devil and
[37:17] that was it all right
[37:20] now the one reason I don't and is what I
[37:23] told
[37:23] him according to Ezekiel 18
[37:27] for the Lord
[37:29] says All Souls are
[37:32] mine the soul that's sth it shall die
[37:35] right amen all right now if Satan can
[37:39] give you a soul now we're going to get
[37:40] into this nature in a minute so then
[37:42] just bear with me of what people are
[37:44] saying about it you know well I'm not
[37:46] really talking about I'm talking about
[37:47] the nature of that you know well we'll
[37:49] get to that in a second yeah all right
[37:52] but see Satan cannot create that's right
[37:56] amen okay
[37:57] go ahead brothers and pull up some of
[37:59] these things and we'll read some points
[38:03] and I will try to give them to you if I
[38:04] can as we go along but the main issue is
[38:07] to show you that Satan cannot
[38:09] create to show you brother around said
[38:11] that right well then if he can't create
[38:13] how can he give you a soul right no no
[38:16] that's what I'm saying hang on to your
[38:17] nature part hang on to you you know to
[38:20] the part about the the nature till we
[38:23] get down to where brother R says the
[38:25] nature of your soul is God if you're
[38:27] bornn again if it's nonsense of the
[38:28] world
[38:30] right and I had a two soul man tell me
[38:33] he said how can a nature have a nature I
[38:34] said you go argue with brother brandom I
[38:36] didn't make the
[38:37] statement that's what I told stand in
[38:39] Jeffersonville Indiana because you know
[38:41] I was just I just gave you what brother
[38:44] ROM had to say about it right all right
[38:46] so we gave the scripture now that all
[38:48] souls are
[38:49] mine now there's nowhere in the Bible
[38:52] that you can find that Satan can create
[38:55] you can I want the scripture
[38:58] you say well he creates Havoc he creates
[39:00] Z all he perverts amen right that's
[39:05] where his problem is he is not does not
[39:08] have the ability to create you see what
[39:09] he creates
[39:11] wrong he had to be allowed to do that
[39:16] right he said when he creates Havoc or
[39:19] heresies or doctrines he had to be
[39:21] allowed to do that right he cannot
[39:25] create he can do all the other things
[39:28] but he can't create that's the one thing
[39:30] your profit holds that Satan can't do is
[39:32] he cannot create so look what he says
[39:35] all right on the questions and answers
[39:37] in 54 so we'll go from here and then
[39:40] we'll go to 65 see to make sure you know
[39:43] it's before the after the seal doctrine
[39:44] of people we'll get to that
[39:47] eventually iew 54 10 10 103 the morning
[39:51] service paragraph 137 he had a question
[39:54] today brother Bill the Bible said it e
[39:56] said I got the son from The Lord exactly
[39:58] right it had to come from the Lord the
[40:01] Lord's only Creator there is he God
[40:03] created the
[40:06] devil how's that God created the devil
[40:09] God created every Fallen Angel there is
[40:12] is that right my certainly that was
[40:15] their choice not his he created you what
[40:18] are you doing about it you'll be judged
[40:21] the same as they you'll be judged as
[40:23] same as they are there you are certainly
[40:26] all right so God even
[40:30] created the Devil he's the only Creator
[40:35] amen there's no other
[40:38] Creator see God's the only one okay
[40:40] number
[40:42] two God's power transformation 65 911
[40:45] paragraph
[40:47] 42 he's the only Creator there is there
[40:49] is no other Creator but God Satan cannot
[40:52] create at all he only perverts what's
[40:55] been created
[40:57] God is the only Creator and he says he
[40:59] goes on about his word
[41:04] h going down to the next one while we
[41:06] add it 64-8 identifications paragraph
[41:10] 74 so much still he was the word in full
[41:13] the word of God flowed through him so
[41:15] freely that even he could speak a word
[41:17] and it would create see that showed who
[41:19] he was who can create but God see God is
[41:23] the only Creator there is
[41:26] go down to the next we we'll get this
[41:28] reading out of the way uh the queen of
[41:30] Shea
[41:31] E28 1961 to19 the devil cannot create
[41:36] the devil only perverts what God's
[41:37] created there's only one Creator that's
[41:40] God what is a lie it's a truth Mis
[41:42] represented what is a bad woman it's a
[41:44] good woman that's been perverted see
[41:46] anything that is perverted is of the
[41:48] devil right anything in it's original
[41:51] condition is of god see God is the only
[41:53] Creator and the devil cannot create he
[41:56] has to pervert what God has created keep
[41:58] that in your mind all right now so he
[42:03] cannot create so if you say Satan gave
[42:06] you
[42:08] soul and God gave you a soul you're
[42:11] making Satan a Creator
[42:13] right CU see they didn't teach it now
[42:16] you'd say well the way I'd say
[42:19] that they didn't teach what you said
[42:22] about it they said Satan gave you a
[42:25] soul
[42:28] so we read now that he can't give you a
[42:30] soul right but he can pervert
[42:36] right he can pervert whatever God makes
[42:39] right but he cannot create it so if you
[42:42] make him a Creator you you're battling
[42:45] against things and and you run a ground
[42:47] on on a lot of points all right
[42:52] now you say but brother Dale they were
[42:55] only teaching that the soul is the
[42:57] nature of the
[42:58] spirit I agree that's what they done but
[43:00] they really didn't say
[43:02] that the original one that taught it
[43:05] said it this way quote the nature is
[43:09] just the soul is just the nature of the
[43:11] spirit now I want a quote from Brother
[43:15] Brown that's why brother colag and
[43:17] brother Dy can verify that they would
[43:19] the man said something down there us
[43:21] about brother said so and so he told us
[43:23] to raise your hand and I raised my hand
[43:26] he said what Brother D I said brother
[43:28] didn't say that yes he did well there's
[43:31] another brother sitting right there
[43:32] beside of he said brother they righty it
[43:34] brother said Amen brother didn't say
[43:38] that and he said okay I'll say it I said
[43:40] we'll continue if you want to say you
[43:42] said it go ahead and what you're doing
[43:44] just don't say to these here that are
[43:46] sitting here that brother brandham said
[43:49] this I'm just going to tell you he
[43:50] didn't say it see if you say the soul is
[43:53] just the nature of the spirit Lo in then
[43:57] you're locking it to one thing and
[43:58] you're making it nothing right exactly
[44:01] yep yep so you're making the soul
[44:05] nothing but it's just the nature of it
[44:11] right then that wouldn't work right now
[44:14] brother Rand go ahead with number five
[44:16] brother on the token and listen to what
[44:19] he says here and it'll come
[44:20] close cuz he'll actually make the
[44:23] statement now the animal life could not
[44:25] come back to the human because they
[44:27] wouldn't match the animal life has no
[44:30] soul in it the human life has a soul the
[44:32] animal doesn't know he is naked he
[44:34] doesn't know right from wrong he he just
[44:37] he has a spirit but not a soul remember
[44:40] now the soul is the nature of the spirit
[44:44] of course right all right
[44:49] now so
[44:52] then if you're just saying it's the
[44:54] nature of something you're not seeing
[44:56] what a real soul is that's right and
[44:59] that's what's wrong with the people when
[45:01] that Doctrine started they were arguing
[45:03] and fussing over it and it really worked
[45:08] out good for me you know why because I
[45:11] began to consider and
[45:15] study what is a
[45:19] soul they talking about how many you had
[45:23] I was trying to figure out what a soul
[45:25] was and I went to a certain brother's
[45:27] church and preached
[45:31] that that God is a have a soul
[45:35] right and the brother he didn't like
[45:40] it to begin
[45:42] with right y because he he didn't see
[45:45] what I was talking about right
[45:47] so he differed with me till he went to
[45:50] somebody else
[45:51] and said to that brother said you know
[45:53] brother Dale says that God is a soul the
[45:56] brother said he's exactly right right do
[45:59] he went back home and study thank God he
[46:00] run into the right person all right all
[46:04] right now
[46:07] just forgive me for coughing you clear
[46:10] your throat I do okay but now what is a
[46:14] soul if you're going to talk about two
[46:16] Souls there you what is a soul
[46:20] amen you
[46:23] know you know the soul is the most
[46:25] important thing about you amen that's
[46:28] right yes it is the only part yep that
[46:32] has eternal life yep that's right you
[46:35] know by the new birth got it's the only
[46:38] part of you that has eternal life we've
[46:40] been through that on the new birth okay
[46:42] so now the soul is not just a nature of
[46:45] something just to no see a dog has a
[46:47] nature right you take a bird dog you
[46:51] don't have to train a bird dog Point
[46:54] Birds
[46:56] some unknown reason he'll
[46:58] just spread out he'll point it to birds
[47:02] of course he may point it to dogs and
[47:04] the cats and the horses and he may point
[47:06] at everything you got to train him about
[47:08] the birds all right but that's his
[47:11] nature of
[47:13] him you know see then the animals can
[47:15] have those form of nature but they don't
[47:19] have a
[47:20] soul all
[47:22] right see that soul of you is actually
[47:25] your being
[47:26] right it's the only part while we're in
[47:29] this world that God can make Eternal
[47:33] right amen we're going to have to go
[47:34] through a change of this body and
[47:37] spirit to be able to talk about eternal
[47:40] life in body and spirit right you say
[47:42] yeah but brother Dale I got all these
[47:43] quotes yes you
[47:45] have and brother brandom from the
[47:48] beginning where he was at now listen to
[47:50] my
[47:51] words listen out there to my
[47:54] words on most every do way that he would
[47:59] teach up until about 62 on the greatest
[48:02] battle ever
[48:03] fought up until that time he would
[48:05] basically cover the three reals of man
[48:09] and he'd say
[48:11] Body
[48:13] Soul
[48:16] Spirit he would make the spirit the
[48:19] center
[48:20] real okay now that is a doctrine of
[48:24] mankind and brother ROM followed it cuz
[48:27] he was basically following it from a
[48:29] scientifical side to looking at what
[48:31] people were saying I ran into a group of
[48:34] people before I heard of this
[48:36] message that said you did not have a
[48:40] soul until the law
[48:45] came that's what they T I asked the man
[48:48] said but according to Genesis God BR in
[48:51] about 27 God BR in the nost of Adam he
[48:54] become a living Soul he said I never
[48:56] thought of that he was up he was
[48:57] teaching a class at work out there about
[49:00] it but see that was their Doctrine they
[49:02] believe when the law came it brought you
[49:04] a knowledge of
[49:06] sin see that would bring you a
[49:09] soul no
[49:12] Adam according to my Bible was a created
[49:15] man right Body Spirit and soul right all
[49:19] right now follow me and don't don't turn
[49:21] me off at least you hear the end of this
[49:23] point all right cuz I've been it here
[49:25] with the people a lot but you out there
[49:27] maybe hadn't heard the
[49:30] point but see like I said basically
[49:32] brother around now he would interace
[49:35] soul in
[49:36] spirit he would speak so in spirit and
[49:39] drop it backwards and forth he would
[49:41] have the soul in the center and the
[49:43] spirit in the outer and then he would
[49:45] have the the spirit as the center the
[49:47] soul in the outer y all right until he
[49:50] comes up to about
[49:51] 62 the greatest battle ever fought is
[49:54] about the best time that he start hearts
[49:55] and you can see in that that he's going
[49:57] this way and all at once he lined it up
[50:00] because according to the Bible that you
[50:03] know that you would even understand by
[50:05] the opening of the word Hebrews 4:12 you
[50:07] would be able to discern between the
[50:10] joint neir and the soul and the
[50:12] spirit so when the scripture begin to
[50:15] open to the prophet then he always
[50:17] taught it Body Spirit
[50:21] Soul
[50:23] okay now I said saying he interlaced him
[50:27] in the older the early Ministry of the
[50:30] soul is the center the spirit is the
[50:32] outside and the spirit is the center the
[50:34] soul is outside but here's one thing you
[50:36] say well why didn't he straighten that
[50:40] out you know why can't we find a tape
[50:43] where brother Brown said I was wrong
[50:45] here because he was not
[50:48] wrong he was lacking of understanding
[50:51] right the reason he wasn't
[50:54] wrong
[50:56] look he always gave three rims of
[51:00] man he always gave the senses of those
[51:04] Realms body was body was see taste feel
[51:09] smell and hear right right second realm
[51:13] of man whatever you want to call it is
[51:15] memory reason conscience affection what
[51:18] imagination all right the cerim of man
[51:22] he always taught was either one of the
[51:24] two things not two thing one of the two
[51:27] it was either Faith or doubt amen was in
[51:31] the soul you know the sinner so he had
[51:33] it right so if you look at what I'm
[51:36] talking about when you're reading or
[51:38] hearing the early Tes and you're
[51:39] listening to it and he said see there
[51:41] the the spirit of man is the center of
[51:44] man watch him he'll say the soul has got
[51:48] memory reason conscious affections
[51:52] right see he had his Doctrine right it
[51:55] was just just is wording right all right
[51:57] now I'm going to show you something if
[51:59] you'll do it you I'm I'm asking you
[52:01] especially the the Learned Scholars that
[52:03] may be listening
[52:04] preachers you cannot go in we in uh
[52:07] Strong's Concordance run it in on your
[52:10] computer run spirit and run
[52:13] Soul it's interrelation word it's so
[52:15] close to the same until they do not
[52:17] differ between
[52:20] right they do not differ in the fact of
[52:22] spirit whether it is the Holy Spirit
[52:25] right or whether it is man's spirit
[52:28] because they were not capable of being
[52:30] able to distinguish right but the before
[52:33] and the after of the thought tells you
[52:35] which one is right it tells you if it's
[52:38] talking about man's Spirit read the
[52:40] before of it and after you'll see if
[52:41] it's talking about man Spirit or
[52:42] talkinging about the Holy Spirit see
[52:43] then that way it's simple for you to see
[52:45] it all right see now to do that then
[52:50] what is a
[52:51] soul what do you want to call it Spirit
[52:54] what what is that Center real that has
[52:56] the one sense of Faith or doubt that's
[52:59] the real
[53:01] you Soul means being it means spirit
[53:05] means person
[53:07] y all right now to show you when the
[53:10] prophet needed it to be and come into
[53:12] understanding God gave it because the
[53:14] scripture doesn't say the spirit that
[53:16] sent us shall die right amen say that
[53:20] right said the soul that sin us shall
[53:22] die y
[53:24] amen see so then the prophet had to line
[53:27] with the scriptures so when he got into
[53:29] the 62 and the last part of it there
[53:31] there you can see from then on he would
[53:33] always say Body Spirit
[53:37] Soul well because God was unveiling the
[53:40] word as I said Hebrews uh 412 I think it
[53:44] is this sharper the two-edged sword
[53:46] dividing between joint and Mar and
[53:48] between the soul and the spirit all
[53:50] right now that's not how smart I am
[53:53] that's how God can speak to you
[53:55] right cuz I was just like everybody else
[53:57] when I read it I wondered why he made
[53:59] these statements and made them
[54:01] statements and I was simply praying one
[54:04] day about it and the Lord spoke to me
[54:06] and said see he never changed the
[54:09] senses right he only changed the wording
[54:13] right amen not the
[54:15] senses all right there's always five
[54:18] senses to the body always five senses to
[54:20] the second real whether he called it
[54:22] Spirit or Soul always one sense to the a
[54:25] real whether he would call it soully
[54:27] Spirit it was the same and that's what I
[54:29] told those Brothers in I said Brothers
[54:30] you don't
[54:32] understand I said if you got two Souls
[54:36] you got two persons in you right right
[54:38] now you'll see that these doctrines will
[54:40] inter
[54:41] Rel of the people of the
[54:44] message because when you get to the two
[54:47] Lords you're going to see the same point
[54:48] right
[54:50] yep you get to the doctrine of the two
[54:52] Lords you're going to see that it
[54:54] actually come from
[54:56] the two Soul Doctrine right you've got
[54:58] what you call the change of the
[55:00] soul that is a big part of the doctrine
[55:03] that flew off from the two Souls you got
[55:06] what you call the exchange of the
[55:09] soul and you got all of those things and
[55:13] what the man that taught the two Soul
[55:15] part of it was he said if you're born
[55:18] again in other words if you're capable
[55:19] of being saved God comes down and
[55:22] destroys the old soul
[55:26] now listen to this is of what I'm saying
[55:28] because this is what the man
[55:31] talk that you destroyed the old God
[55:34] would destroy the soul that come from
[55:38] Satan and he said the one that come from
[55:40] God never did need
[55:43] anything it always was eternal yeah now
[55:47] you see all these doctrines coming out
[55:49] of the people the message oh yeah about
[55:52] eternity y they have in their basic back
[55:55] there
[55:57] with that Doctrine right I've told you
[56:01] here about it and you know it that I had
[56:03] an opportunity to talk with a Mormon and
[56:06] he was a pretty good rank of a
[56:08] Mormon and uh cuz they have different
[56:11] ranks he was a male Chic rank which he
[56:14] was close to capability all Mormons
[56:17] cannot have more than one wife it is not
[56:20] meant that everybody can have more than
[56:21] one wife in the Mormon it is meant only
[56:25] those who can afford them and those who
[56:27] have the rank capable of being that
[56:32] which was basically if you want to call
[56:33] him priest yeah all right now that's
[56:36] Mormon Doctrine it's okay now but I
[56:39] talked to this man for about for 8 hours
[56:41] I asked him to explain the Mormon
[56:43] Doctrine when he finished at the end of
[56:45] that 8 hours I could lay his name or
[56:49] this brother's name right down over his
[56:51] and they were saying the same
[56:52] thing so you say you got a soul
[56:56] from from
[56:58] Satan the Mormon Doctrine is that
[57:00] everybody's up in heaven everybody
[57:03] everybody ever be in the world was up in
[57:06] heaven all right we were talking about
[57:09] how that we could um come to Earth be
[57:13] lost or something and and
[57:17] uh honor our
[57:21] Father by salvation and whatever you
[57:23] know and the doctrine was
[57:28] that Satan now
[57:31] listen Satan wanted to save everybody in
[57:35] the world Lucifer the anointed cherub
[57:38] you know they knew the
[57:40] story it was kind of funny when it
[57:42] started off with a man he said if you
[57:43] knew about prophets that's what he said
[57:45] he said if you just knew a little bit
[57:47] about prophets he said you and I could
[57:49] talk I said continue brother we can talk
[57:53] but anyhow they prophets come up with
[57:55] these ideas and they can change the
[57:57] Bible and do what they want to you know
[57:59] and different things or the polygamy
[58:00] came in and then they come over and
[58:02] wrote another rule it it's not right and
[58:04] it didn't stop most of them from being
[58:06] polygamist but
[58:08] anyhow the doctrine is that Satan wanted
[58:11] to save
[58:13] everybody but
[58:16] Jesus just wanted to save a few people
[58:18] or certain amount now that shows you
[58:21] right off to start with that something's
[58:22] messed up right cuz Satan save everybody
[58:26] and Jesus only want to save so
[58:27] many but that's their Doctrine now you
[58:30] go find one talk to him just ask him to
[58:32] explain it to
[58:34] you and Satan got mad because Lucifer
[58:38] you know he wasn't Satan then he wasn't
[58:40] the devil he was the anointed
[58:43] cherub and he got upset and he came to
[58:46] Earth as being
[58:47] mad and that's why the battle has been
[58:50] going on ever since all right now they
[58:54] believe the Mormons believe that ever so
[58:57] often God empowers a certain person with
[59:01] the ability to be a
[59:03] prophet and that he can speak to the
[59:05] people and that's why they change as
[59:07] they go along you know and different
[59:08] things but see what would be the
[59:11] difference in the doctrine of the Mormon
[59:13] then and the doctrine of the people of
[59:14] the message to believe in Two
[59:16] Souls because they would believe that
[59:18] Satan give you a soul y well he can't
[59:21] give you a soul that make him a Creator
[59:23] right amen cuz a soul is is real right
[59:25] amen amen your soul is whole whole lot
[59:28] more real than your body right man this
[59:32] thing we beat on here we call it wood
[59:34] that's nothing that just destroys with
[59:36] ashes you know that's burned up but
[59:38] there's no way that you can burn up the
[59:40] soul right
[59:42] amen God is the only one that can
[59:45] destroy a soul amen right as I said
[59:48] while I go it does not say the spirit
[59:51] that's in it it shall die it says the
[59:52] soul that's in it shall die right all
[59:56] right meaning the real
[59:59] you the real you is that Soul within you
[1:00:02] right the spirit real we've covered that
[1:00:05] the spirit real is in your memory
[1:00:08] imagination and stuff and it Satan can
[1:00:11] penetrate that and just cause all kind
[1:00:13] of Havoc within you yes in all right and
[1:00:17] then your body is nothing without the
[1:00:19] spirit the Bible said so it just
[1:00:21] displays what the spirit within us is
[1:00:23] doing with that real soul in there
[1:00:25] sealed in amen so then that man in the
[1:00:27] Hebrew book that was a preacher I think
[1:00:30] and he went out and got him some beer
[1:00:32] sat down said he wasn't going to preach
[1:00:33] no more wasn't going to do it you know a
[1:00:35] couple weeks later he died right brother
[1:00:38] brandom
[1:00:40] said God would not let him Mar his name
[1:00:43] he took his child home right so you see
[1:00:46] people out here just living like the
[1:00:47] devil and they say well I was saved at
[1:00:49] one time now something wrong there I
[1:00:52] don't I can't follow that line of
[1:00:54] thought
[1:00:55] I've got to to be a different but now
[1:00:58] get to point that Judas is
[1:01:03] cared was a human soul
[1:01:07] amen
[1:01:09] right uh
[1:01:11] Cain Cain in the
[1:01:14] Genesis was a living Soul amen that's
[1:01:17] right cuz when a baby comes forth God
[1:01:19] breathes into its nostrils and it
[1:01:21] becomes a living soul and as I've
[1:01:23] expressed to you before I'm glad the
[1:01:24] prophet explained that because that
[1:01:26] doesn't mean that these babies that have
[1:01:28] to be aborted or different things
[1:01:30] they're not living Souls right you'll
[1:01:32] argue that point that's all right you'll
[1:01:35] argue they can cry so does an animal cry
[1:01:37] in the mother's room you can argue that
[1:01:40] pain will inflict it'll do it to an
[1:01:41] animal see it's not that it's not a
[1:01:44] living Soul until it comes forth right
[1:01:47] right CU brother brand said he's waiting
[1:01:50] he said that more one said she's she's
[1:01:53] kind of arrogant and hateful and said
[1:01:54] said all at once right around the time
[1:01:55] the baby b this get this sweet this
[1:01:58] around her he said that's that little
[1:02:01] body waiting on that baby to drop that
[1:02:04] little soul to go into that baby when
[1:02:08] the baby comes forth God gives you the
[1:02:10] soul Satan cannot create but the minute
[1:02:13] that Soul comes into that
[1:02:16] baby and the little baby can't see
[1:02:19] nothing blurred hardly but he's still
[1:02:21] he's got all of the mov and he looks
[1:02:24] around down and here's two nurses and
[1:02:26] one of them saying well look at that
[1:02:29] blankety blank little baby laying there
[1:02:31] you know said You know here we had a
[1:02:33] good night going until three babies were
[1:02:35] born and we going to have to work all
[1:02:36] night the poor little kid that's he
[1:02:39] starts off
[1:02:40] from that's where Satan starts
[1:02:43] perverting our nature right God cannot
[1:02:46] give us a soul that is not good right he
[1:02:50] cannot create an evil Soul right he's
[1:02:53] not the author of evil things right amen
[1:02:56] oh but brother Dale I got the scripture
[1:02:58] where it says God knows good and evil
[1:02:59] yes he knows good and evil right
[1:03:02] right he knows of it but he don't allow
[1:03:05] it right there's no part of him it can
[1:03:08] come from he just knows of it all right
[1:03:11] now following the point then that soul
[1:03:13] is the real
[1:03:16] you that soul is the real you right amen
[1:03:20] and that's what God starts working on
[1:03:22] read black read uh souls in
[1:03:26] prison and you'll understand a lot what
[1:03:29] the prophet is saying about it all right
[1:03:31] go ahead and pull that quote up brothers
[1:03:33] let's just look at cuz look what brother
[1:03:35] Brown said number six this is taking
[1:03:37] souls in prison 63 11:10 morning service
[1:03:40] paragraph
[1:03:41] 36 when he said we are dead the
[1:03:44] scripture plainly tells us that we are
[1:03:46] dead and our lives are HID in God
[1:03:47] through Christ sealed there by the Holy
[1:03:50] Spirit now it wasn't that your body died
[1:03:55] now he's talking about when you're
[1:03:56] getting born again right now watch it
[1:04:00] wasn't your excuse it wasn't that your
[1:04:03] body died it wasn't your spirit died it
[1:04:08] was the nature of your spirit
[1:04:12] died that's why Ezekiel said I give you
[1:04:14] a new heart and new spirit so you
[1:04:16] couldn't stand yourself with that other
[1:04:18] Spirit you have all right see the nature
[1:04:21] which is the
[1:04:23] soul
[1:04:26] right whatever the spirit is is
[1:04:29] motivated by the soul
[1:04:31] right whatever the body is is motivated
[1:04:34] by the spirit right see the nature of
[1:04:37] your soul is is God if you're born again
[1:04:41] if not it's of the
[1:04:44] world now that's as plain as you can be
[1:04:47] the nature of your soul is God if you're
[1:04:48] born again if it's not see wasn't your
[1:04:52] your body that died when you get a new
[1:04:55] birth it wasn't your spirit that died
[1:04:58] right and when he said I give you a new
[1:05:00] heart and a new spirit did he take out
[1:05:02] the spirit you have Spirit you standing
[1:05:04] here go by Spirit then God has to reach
[1:05:06] in get that Spirit rip it out put in
[1:05:07] another Spirit no no he just works on
[1:05:11] the nature of the thing right you know
[1:05:14] what the nature of the thing comes from
[1:05:16] the inward part of you
[1:05:18] right so what I've been trying to
[1:05:20] explain on on sanctification
[1:05:22] justification just Toops off the p of
[1:05:24] the Soul sanctification starts what
[1:05:28] cleansing and setting aside a place
[1:05:31] right in the soul for God to
[1:05:34] live then the new birth is a life place
[1:05:36] within
[1:05:37] there so then it comes out to be that
[1:05:41] that Soul then displays what nature it
[1:05:44] is out through the
[1:05:46] spirit and the spirit out through the
[1:05:49] body and you can see what the person is
[1:05:51] right because of that doing but but the
[1:05:54] soul is the real you all
[1:05:58] right
[1:06:00] now to show
[1:06:02] you John
[1:06:04] 12:27 now these are just scripture so
[1:06:06] I'll just quote them to
[1:06:08] you Jesus when they were fixing to place
[1:06:11] him on the no that was when he was in
[1:06:13] the uh there at the park said now is my
[1:06:17] soul troubled
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:21] y don't we got soul amen
[1:06:25] and I don't like to say he had a soul I
[1:06:27] like to say he is a soul right so I
[1:06:29] don't like to say that you got a soul
[1:06:31] you are a soul amen amen so you're a
[1:06:34] soul you're a spirit and you're a body
[1:06:37] it's not you have one because that would
[1:06:39] mean that you got something here and you
[1:06:42] have to keep putting over into there to
[1:06:44] make it work out and that's why I didn't
[1:06:46] agree with him when they said the soul
[1:06:47] is just the nature of the spirit see
[1:06:51] this means it's nothing right it's just
[1:06:52] nothing it's nothing
[1:06:54] when I knew what the Bible had to say
[1:06:56] about
[1:06:57] it all right what about the psalmist
[1:07:03] David that said in Psalm 42
[1:07:06] and2 my soul thirth after thee amen
[1:07:11] there's a lot of that in the psalmist
[1:07:13] about him thirsting his soul right
[1:07:17] now what is the second
[1:07:20] death first death you die go to the
[1:07:22] Grave what is the second
[1:07:24] death it's the death of the Soul
[1:07:27] according to Revelations 20 14 and
[1:07:31] 15 every
[1:07:34] soul is going to die that's not born
[1:07:37] again amen or given eternal life going
[1:07:40] to be destroyed amen Every Soul so it's
[1:07:43] the soul that's in
[1:07:45] us when when you die naturally what
[1:07:49] happens the soul leaves the body now I
[1:07:52] know what the Bible says about about the
[1:07:54] spirit go back to God who gave it that's
[1:07:56] that's a hard thing to comprehend but it
[1:08:00] is
[1:08:01] scriptural but still I can't see that it
[1:08:04] goes and attaches itself back to him
[1:08:07] right so that means your spirit is not
[1:08:08] really real
[1:08:10] you no that's right it's not the real
[1:08:13] you your spirit is not that's right your
[1:08:15] soul is the real you so you don't have
[1:08:16] to deal with where it goes the spirit
[1:08:18] you don't have to deal with where that
[1:08:20] part go you deal with where the soul
[1:08:21] goes and when brother Brown went beond
[1:08:24] the curtain of
[1:08:27] time even the angel of the Lord called
[1:08:30] it Souls under the
[1:08:33] alt
[1:08:36] amen cuz he seen the people there in
[1:08:38] Soul when he said Jesus Christ that now
[1:08:40] you need all these I can sply for you
[1:08:41] okay 40 years teaching in order to be
[1:08:43] able to without the
[1:08:45] computer but thank God for them but see
[1:08:50] that
[1:08:51] Soul when you die it either it's going
[1:08:54] downward to a place to abide or it's
[1:08:57] going upward that's right amen it's
[1:08:59] either going to a place of Abode like
[1:09:02] beyond the curtain of time or it's going
[1:09:04] to what we call hail goana sh Hades etc
[1:09:09] etc we know all of the
[1:09:11] wordings it's going to the place of the
[1:09:14] lost if you're not born again you're
[1:09:17] born again it's going into the
[1:09:18] dimensions of God
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:22] now like we could spend a long time cuz
[1:09:25] we have that a foolish virgin wouldn't
[1:09:27] be going to hell their soul wouldn't but
[1:09:29] so there must be another place that can
[1:09:30] abide until time can be but for them to
[1:09:32] be given eternal life so we've been
[1:09:34] through that but now the main point I'm
[1:09:36] W you to
[1:09:37] see Jesus's soul went to hell that's
[1:09:39] what brother Brown said he went and
[1:09:41] preached to the spirits that were in
[1:09:42] prison brother Brown said it was the
[1:09:44] souls that was in prison the Bible calls
[1:09:46] it Spirits in in prison he said Souls
[1:09:48] that were in
[1:09:50] prison and Jesus's soul went down to
[1:09:53] them
[1:09:55] and he testified to him he was a person
[1:09:58] right amen he wasn't a myth or a fog it
[1:10:01] floated to hell and they looked around
[1:10:02] no he was standing
[1:10:04] down all
[1:10:06] right the same one standing down there
[1:10:09] was the same one standing up here that
[1:10:11] brother Ram said when he appeared to
[1:10:14] Abraham
[1:10:16] right as mdic that's right amen that man
[1:10:21] standing there was God that's right soul
[1:10:24] in that body that you look at righten he
[1:10:26] said it was the same one that Moses saw
[1:10:29] the back part said he saw the theophany
[1:10:33] right the theophany is the soul no
[1:10:37] brother we got doct about the theophany
[1:10:39] we going to it that's where you're
[1:10:40] messed up we'll cover that docto amen
[1:10:43] it's not you going somewhere I thought
[1:10:45] God supposed to come here
[1:10:48] right I don't know we'll pray J the
[1:10:50] Hebrew Book brother said your soul you
[1:10:52] theop argue with him
[1:10:54] right but
[1:10:56] listen see the Bible says
[1:11:00] Matthew um got to be 1028 let me look at
[1:11:04] this
[1:11:06] one got to be 1028 or 1228 so I have to
[1:11:09] look see which one it
[1:11:15] is cuz I made a circle around it
[1:11:21] 1028 oh yeah and if you're not being
[1:11:23] which kill the
[1:11:25] body but are not able to kill the soul
[1:11:29] but rather fear him which is able to
[1:11:31] destroy both soul and Body in hell
[1:11:35] that's right so the Bible's plain about
[1:11:37] the
[1:11:38] soul all right so then in doing that
[1:11:42] brother Bram calls it on the message of
[1:11:45] samon church
[1:11:46] age of the death of the Soul go ahead
[1:11:49] and pull that up brother number
[1:11:51] seven the first day is separated from
[1:11:54] your loved one separating from your
[1:11:56] loved
[1:11:57] one we're gone in the presence of God
[1:12:00] never out of his presence now if there's
[1:12:02] a second death then it had to be the
[1:12:04] death of the soul and then he that
[1:12:06] overcomes the world or overcomes the
[1:12:07] thing of the world has eternal life and
[1:12:09] shall not be touched by the second death
[1:12:13] all right going on to number eight that
[1:12:15] was part page the paragraph 150 this is
[1:12:19] paragraph
[1:12:20] 49 now there's one death that we know
[1:12:23] about it there's got to be another death
[1:12:25] somewhere else because death we die is
[1:12:27] here in the flesh the second death we
[1:12:29] die in the spirit the soul it's the soul
[1:12:31] that Sinn us shall surely die that's
[1:12:33] 1960 1207 pergent age uh and he goes
[1:12:37] down but a Christian does not die
[1:12:39] there's no scripture that a Christian
[1:12:40] dies because he's got eternal life when
[1:12:42] a sinner dies he's finished and his soul
[1:12:44] will finally
[1:12:46] die cuz the soul is a last
[1:12:49] destruction huh yep but when a Christian
[1:12:51] dies he's just waiting with Jes Jesus to
[1:12:54] return back again see even a sinner is
[1:12:57] still alive somewhere in his soul right
[1:13:01] waiting for the day of the Judgment then
[1:13:03] at the day of judgment it can come forth
[1:13:05] to the basis
[1:13:08] of let me make sure I don't cover too
[1:13:11] far cuz I inter relate I ain't going to
[1:13:13] do it cuz I'm going just hold
[1:13:15] it all
[1:13:19] right now I want to ask you a simple
[1:13:22] point
[1:13:24] if it's your
[1:13:25] spirit is the center realm of
[1:13:29] you then look what you be dealing
[1:13:32] with because we just got through
[1:13:34] covering and we talked a good bit about
[1:13:37] well Jesus said the unclean Spirit goeth
[1:13:39] out of a
[1:13:41] man let the unclean Spirit goeth out of
[1:13:44] a
[1:13:45] man right are you listening if the
[1:13:49] unclean Spirit goth out of the man and
[1:13:51] the Soul was not the real you
[1:13:54] why would you need a new birth
[1:13:58] right if the unclean Spirit has gone out
[1:14:00] of you and that's all you need is the
[1:14:01] unclean Spirit to be gone out of you
[1:14:03] then you don't need a new birth well see
[1:14:05] that's what they taught you didn't need
[1:14:06] a new birth because you always was
[1:14:12] eternal you see they made it the spirit
[1:14:14] of you that was eternal right and the
[1:14:17] Soul was just the nature of the spirit
[1:14:20] okay see that's what they made the soul
[1:14:22] just be the nature of the
[1:14:24] and the spirit's a real you see where
[1:14:25] they missed it at the soul is a real
[1:14:27] you amen and think of all the way around
[1:14:30] the world I run into that in in the
[1:14:32] Philippines and they had the wrong
[1:14:33] brother and Tack to the name of it and
[1:14:35] they had really been and you just
[1:14:38] think and you think about that we sent
[1:14:41] money to a lot of these places for them
[1:14:43] to be able to print books and to do
[1:14:46] things to help
[1:14:48] them and those brothers were at the
[1:14:51] mercy of those men that came over there
[1:14:53] with
[1:14:54] quotes until they begin to get a few
[1:14:57] books of their
[1:14:59] own they could not argue with him about
[1:15:02] whether it was two souls or what it was
[1:15:05] and the man went over there maybe not
[1:15:07] himself personally because they thought
[1:15:08] the other man was ahead of it it really
[1:15:11] inflicted a lot of damage in the
[1:15:14] island and a lot of things throughout
[1:15:16] the philes was messed up on C that ran
[1:15:19] into it in
[1:15:21] Brazil that it has a lot of thought
[1:15:23] following around the world still today
[1:15:25] about the two Soul Doctrine in one form
[1:15:28] or the other is still inflicting damage
[1:15:30] around the
[1:15:32] world you know and they're still talking
[1:15:34] about and that's what I said this
[1:15:35] morning whether you caught it or not
[1:15:37] that don't cabbage down if brother Dale
[1:15:39] dies and gone off the scene don't
[1:15:41] cabbage down and say we got what is it
[1:15:43] we got brother Dale's word you get God
[1:15:46] to speak to you that's right amen
[1:15:49] because that's what they had they didn't
[1:15:51] have nothing else they just had what a
[1:15:53] man said and even after he went off in
[1:15:56] polygamy and everything else and I read
[1:15:58] the books where he said that he was
[1:16:00] teaching that you can have the polygamy
[1:16:02] was this great Secret Under the seventh
[1:16:08] seal you had never heard me say this
[1:16:11] one we were talking Brother Gary he
[1:16:13] listening on TV laughing cuz we were
[1:16:16] talking in rym one day and I was telling
[1:16:18] them that's what the brothers believe
[1:16:19] that the great mystery under the seventh
[1:16:21] seal was polygamy that you could have
[1:16:22] more than one
[1:16:26] wife Sister Margaret G's first wife
[1:16:31] she's a very quiet person she didn't say
[1:16:33] a lot you know well she did spoke you
[1:16:35] know speak you listen but she didn't say
[1:16:38] a lot she looked across the table and
[1:16:40] said if Brother Gary can get the
[1:16:43] Revelation that polygamy is okay under
[1:16:45] the seventh seal she said I can get the
[1:16:48] Revelation and I'll take my 357 and blow
[1:16:51] his head off
[1:16:54] she wasn't laughing and I said sister I
[1:16:57] agree with
[1:17:00] you you know that's the great mystery
[1:17:04] see the mystery of the two Soul was and
[1:17:06] brought it on into polygamy was that you
[1:17:08] see the hen and you see the
[1:17:11] rooster you see the buck deer and all of
[1:17:13] the do you see all of the things they
[1:17:16] went through and it's still just going
[1:17:18] all over the world trying to show you
[1:17:20] it's okay brother around said polygamy
[1:17:23] is wrong that's from Daniel 70 weeks you
[1:17:26] want to look it up the polygamy is wrong
[1:17:29] today we're not dealing no more with one
[1:17:31] David and thousand
[1:17:33] wives we're dealing about a man and wife
[1:17:35] being a type of Christ in the church see
[1:17:38] you get into one thing and it goes all
[1:17:39] the way into another one but now
[1:17:42] listen if you caught the point I was
[1:17:44] saying there a minute ago that why did
[1:17:47] Jesus have to die if the unclean Spirit
[1:17:51] go could go out of you
[1:17:54] yeah see then you wouldn't need him
[1:17:55] dying you just needed him driving it out
[1:17:58] that's right but he had to Die Why right
[1:18:01] not to get the spirit to go out of you
[1:18:03] right are you listening the unclean
[1:18:06] Spirit went out right them disciples was
[1:18:08] clean when they went to that upper run
[1:18:09] right they were clean through the word
[1:18:11] that was spoken to them they were
[1:18:12] Sanctified in St John
[1:18:14] 17 but see they didn't have eternal life
[1:18:17] right cuz eternal life was in that soul
[1:18:19] that was in that
[1:18:21] man brother around said this is a quote
[1:18:23] if you want it he said and God ripped
[1:18:27] out of the body of Jesus that soul and
[1:18:32] said it came back the spirit that's the
[1:18:34] way it said the spirit of God came back
[1:18:35] on the day Pentecost in the form of the
[1:18:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul
[1:18:41] amen running soul of God into your
[1:18:44] computers and look what you'll get
[1:18:47] amen cuz you see the only way you can
[1:18:50] have eternal life is for soul to soul
[1:18:53] body to body he's my brother right that
[1:18:56] right Y come on now body to body Jesus
[1:19:00] is just my brother you now you say just
[1:19:02] that's going to confuse a lot of people
[1:19:03] just get get my point body to body we're
[1:19:06] we're
[1:19:07] brothers y Spirit to Spirit we can talk
[1:19:10] in a real higher soul to soul makes me a
[1:19:14] child of
[1:19:16] God see there must needs to be heresies
[1:19:19] among you if you'll take it and study it
[1:19:21] out yeah and get into the right thing
[1:19:25] then you'll see that Adam became a
[1:19:27] living
[1:19:31] soul and God breathed the breath of life
[1:19:34] into his nostrils he became a living
[1:19:37] Soul why does it say that according to
[1:19:39] Blasphemous names Adam was a man moving
[1:19:42] around and then God breathed into his
[1:19:45] nostrils eternal life right especially
[1:19:48] in the Adam was given God's Own eternal
[1:19:51] life what is it that Wade loves so much
[1:19:53] about Genesis 1116 and
[1:19:56] 17 I mean 26
[1:19:59] 27 why because that's only one person
[1:20:03] that's right that's only one
[1:20:07] man that man was created what not
[1:20:11] created but stepped over into another
[1:20:13] form and come
[1:20:15] down right into that body that's my
[1:20:18] brother amen and lived in that body one
[1:20:23] day was removed from
[1:20:25] that he went to hell and preached to the
[1:20:28] souls that were down in
[1:20:30] hell then he came back back into that
[1:20:33] body stepped back in it raised that body
[1:20:35] up 18 19 20 years old
[1:20:39] yep went up and then he comes back on
[1:20:41] the day of Pentecost right the soul of
[1:20:44] God Amen do you say what I I don't know
[1:20:47] where I believe in two souls or not well
[1:20:49] how can you have two
[1:20:51] Souls
[1:20:54] if you got two Souls you got a problem
[1:20:57] that's right I got enough trouble with
[1:20:58] the one I got right act like having two
[1:21:02] wives who would want two wives amen
[1:21:04] that's
[1:21:06] right lust would be the only form that
[1:21:08] you wanted
[1:21:11] in and then why did these men like the
[1:21:13] man that started this doctorine want all
[1:21:15] these little young
[1:21:16] girls he was probably he was older than
[1:21:19] I am and at that time which has been 10
[1:21:21] years ago I was give a take a little bit
[1:21:23] off or something he was somewhere in his
[1:21:25] 60s and why would he want young girls if
[1:21:28] he wanted more than one wife why didn't
[1:21:29] he find any more 60 year old
[1:21:32] women they could all sit around and and
[1:21:35] crack pecans
[1:21:40] and and take it time about cooking and
[1:21:43] washing
[1:21:45] and but it don't never work that way
[1:21:47] does it man don't never want a wife
[1:21:50] older than he is you know like that
[1:21:52] especially if he's 60 he don't want a 70
[1:21:55] year old
[1:21:56] woman he be about like that guy was that
[1:21:59] got up and this man got they prophesied
[1:22:01] in the church and said there's a there's
[1:22:03] a you know he prophesied and said
[1:22:05] there's a I'm supposed to go to Italy or
[1:22:07] somewhere you know and said there's a
[1:22:09] young woman in this building the Lord
[1:22:11] told me he supposed to go there with me
[1:22:14] I'm a missionary this 70y old woman got
[1:22:16] up walked up there and she said Lord
[1:22:19] spoke to me and told me to go with you
[1:22:20] he said hold on just a minute
[1:22:24] he said the Lord just spoke to me and
[1:22:26] told me to stay where I'm
[1:22:28] at so change
[1:22:31] things it ain't funny that's right but
[1:22:34] it is that's right it's funny how maned
[1:22:37] people are right that's right you can
[1:22:39] live out of a bottle all you want to
[1:22:41] whether it's blue or whether it's pink
[1:22:43] or whatever you want to right you can
[1:22:46] have operations you can have anything
[1:22:48] you want to you're going to get older
[1:22:50] that's
[1:22:51] right and you know
[1:22:55] what in this
[1:22:57] Bible what I love it cuz it's
[1:23:01] plain you know that David having all
[1:23:03] them
[1:23:06] wives now you believe this is in the
[1:23:09] Bible he got old worn
[1:23:13] out well they wanted to see if they
[1:23:15] could R revive him
[1:23:17] up plain language let's talk okay where
[1:23:20] they'll understand that on the internet
[1:23:21] but go in your Bible read
[1:23:24] it they give him a young
[1:23:27] virgin as a
[1:23:31] wife to try to revive him up but they
[1:23:35] found out it didn't
[1:23:36] work too far gone
[1:23:40] okay listen
[1:23:44] folks we are nothing but a garbage
[1:23:50] can but God show chose to save us right
[1:23:54] amen that's right place eternal life
[1:23:57] within our soul amen that's right he
[1:24:00] gave us that Soul at Birth and Satan
[1:24:02] perverted
[1:24:03] it the nature part of it working through
[1:24:06] our spirit he got to work upon
[1:24:09] us but one day God came
[1:24:13] down and he gave birth to that Soul amen
[1:24:16] did that solve all the problems
[1:24:19] no God knew we'd need it so there must
[1:24:22] needs to be heresies among
[1:24:26] you there must be doctrines come among
[1:24:29] us to see if we were going to believe
[1:24:31] the truth and stay with
[1:24:34] it now you can say well now I don't
[1:24:37] agree and I I wrote that in my notes
[1:24:39] here a lot of the people that followed
[1:24:40] Theo did not agree with the man that
[1:24:42] started Theo when he went into polygamy
[1:24:44] they didn't agree with him they were
[1:24:45] good people they didn't agree with it
[1:24:48] right but you still still they took the
[1:24:50] same
[1:24:51] Doctrine
[1:24:53] and trying to make the two Souls out of
[1:24:55] it right and when you do you're trying
[1:24:57] to soulmate with
[1:24:59] something and brother rown said I don't
[1:25:01] believe in
[1:25:03] soulmate you're trying to match up
[1:25:05] things and he started a doctrine that
[1:25:08] would later turn out to be and maybe we
[1:25:10] won't cover them but it would turn out
[1:25:11] to be a groups would call it the chain
[1:25:14] of the
[1:25:15] Soul Y and then some would label it even
[1:25:18] the exchange God taking this out putting
[1:25:21] that in
[1:25:22] I've never believ God took anything out
[1:25:24] like that he just takes what you are and
[1:25:27] works on it when he gives you a new
[1:25:29] heart and a new spirit it doesn't mean
[1:25:31] that he takes your spirit out see that
[1:25:34] would lose all your memories your
[1:25:35] reasons your conscience and things would
[1:25:37] go over that and then what would you be
[1:25:40] you'd start a baby over you you wouldn't
[1:25:41] have no memories or nothing he doesn't
[1:25:43] do that he works on the nature of that
[1:25:45] thing he works on that Spirit from the
[1:25:48] inside by the new birth right then he he
[1:25:52] can bring that Spirit into subjection
[1:25:54] right to make the body do what he wanted
[1:25:58] it to do
[1:25:59] right see then that's what God began to
[1:26:02] deal with me about it to show me and
[1:26:04] I'll try to show you each Doctrine as we
[1:26:06] go along if I can remember it as well
[1:26:09] and then we'll say we see where this
[1:26:10] year went over that helped us to see
[1:26:12] this
[1:26:13] right because it was necessary that
[1:26:17] those things come Among
[1:26:20] Us God wanted to try us
[1:26:23] he loves to try you brother R said he
[1:26:26] loves to see whether or not you'll stay
[1:26:27] with the word he put everything in the
[1:26:30] world in your face to make it look good
[1:26:33] I told you about it I don't mind telling
[1:26:35] everything cuz I'm just feel I wrote
[1:26:37] notes on something one time that I was
[1:26:39] intending to preach and I had about five
[1:26:41] pages of quotes Bibles everything and
[1:26:45] you know the way I preach now I would
[1:26:46] challenge anybody to come show me if I'm
[1:26:48] wrong and I was sitting there and I said
[1:26:51] Lord it looks like that's a pretty good
[1:26:53] point I don't know where to bring it out
[1:26:55] or not but it's a pretty good
[1:26:56] thing and this is all he
[1:26:59] said he said if you make
[1:27:02] that he said you make your type greater
[1:27:05] than your
[1:27:09] antitype it didn't take me a week to
[1:27:12] figure that
[1:27:14] out if you make a typ of something a
[1:27:16] boat is the type of a ship right right
[1:27:20] so if you swap places with want you go
[1:27:24] you got the big old boat first little
[1:27:26] boat Li that wouldn't work out that's
[1:27:28] not the way you're going see see if you
[1:27:31] make anything greater about
[1:27:32] D you know say David and his thousand
[1:27:36] wives are the top of the Bride In Christ
[1:27:39] right but if you stay on that where are
[1:27:41] you at
[1:27:44] right you got a problem so you had to
[1:27:46] come to Christ in the church right don't
[1:27:49] make your tip greater than your anti I
[1:27:52] shed those notes and burn them I didn't
[1:27:53] want nobody to ever see it in my wife or
[1:27:55] anybody I never discussed it with
[1:27:58] anybody because I seen it was wrong
[1:28:01] right I thank
[1:28:03] God that he could speak to me
[1:28:07] amen but you know where he spoke to me
[1:28:12] from right out of the word you make your
[1:28:15] tight greater than your ant
[1:28:18] attip I said Thank You
[1:28:21] Lord
[1:28:22] because see I don't want anything like
[1:28:25] that I want to see the real right yes
[1:28:29] and you don't say thank God for the
[1:28:30] herries that's come Among Us that's not
[1:28:33] the attitude because somebody's got to
[1:28:34] bring them and lo and behold look at who
[1:28:38] they you think Judas wanted to be what
[1:28:40] he
[1:28:41] was I don't go that way he was a mortal
[1:28:45] human being but the devil entered into
[1:28:48] him the Bible said and he went out and
[1:28:50] sold the Lord Jesus
[1:28:54] the devil has got in these people and
[1:28:57] even given them signs and wonders
[1:29:00] sure what if you ask God for a
[1:29:03] sign and it comes to
[1:29:07] pass one scripture said if a prophet
[1:29:09] gives you a sign of thing that comes to
[1:29:11] P believe that Prophet because I am with
[1:29:13] him everybody wants to believe it so
[1:29:16] every
[1:29:17] little Fly by Night preacher come along
[1:29:20] got some kind of a gift you see where
[1:29:21] brother Brom then would say it was wrong
[1:29:24] and they start running and they said the
[1:29:25] Lord showed me this one man showed said
[1:29:28] I heard him he said I saw Africa burning
[1:29:31] on fire and he said I'm going there and
[1:29:34] it's going to be a great Revival of
[1:29:36] Africa well as far as I know today when
[1:29:38] I we went to Africa yeah now if the Lord
[1:29:40] showed me that I'd go to Africa right
[1:29:43] wouldn't
[1:29:44] you see that would be the point and I
[1:29:46] just jump up and take off but see that
[1:29:50] wouldn't that wouldn't be the form that
[1:29:52] You' want it to be
[1:29:55] in cuz you have to try that by the
[1:29:59] word see there never will be another
[1:30:01] worldwide sweeping Revival so somebody
[1:30:03] come along preach there going to be a
[1:30:04] worldwide sweeping
[1:30:06] Revival there will be till those two
[1:30:08] witnesses fall with the
[1:30:10] Jews it's your prophet's message there's
[1:30:14] a place down here in Florida years ago
[1:30:16] it had been going about 10 or 15 years
[1:30:18] if it's still going that they were
[1:30:19] having Services 7 days a week
[1:30:22] seeing great signs and wonders take
[1:30:24] place but brother brandham said even
[1:30:27] though you have great signs and wonders
[1:30:29] come to
[1:30:31] pass he said and you continue with the
[1:30:33] same old
[1:30:34] Doctrine he said you're wrong wrong amen
[1:30:39] see that the other scripture they fail
[1:30:40] to read is where it said if a man give
[1:30:42] you a sign and it come to
[1:30:46] pass they get he leads you another to
[1:30:48] another
[1:30:50] God y so don't hear that man but you
[1:30:53] better read the rest of it I sent him
[1:30:55] among
[1:30:57] you to try you
[1:31:01] y somebody come in and say look the
[1:31:03] Dead's going to be raised there's going
[1:31:04] 10 people raised the dead and that show
[1:31:06] you how to believe me what do you say
[1:31:08] about the word

[1:31:32] being truthful but what do you try
[1:31:34] anybody by right the word amen
[1:31:38] amen see if it fits this word amen don't
[1:31:42] fit this word you don't have to fear no
[1:31:45] years ago this sister told me while I
[1:31:46] said there a man over in India he
[1:31:49] believed he was God not just another
[1:31:52] something you know that brother Ram come
[1:31:54] to introduce him because he was God and
[1:31:57] the lady said I'm afraid to say anything
[1:31:59] about it well I said does he believe
[1:32:00] brother Brown's message you know well he
[1:32:03] said brother Brown was wrong in places
[1:32:05] she said well I ain't got no fear of
[1:32:08] him right that's right why because he's
[1:32:11] off the message why you going to be
[1:32:13] afraid of him Bo that you B
[1:32:17] back but listen church do you understand

[1:32:24] much readon I'm trying to put it on you
[1:32:25] but it's to help us
[1:32:29] right it anchors you down amen see then
[1:32:33] when somebody comes along with another
[1:32:34] one you say
[1:32:35] uhoh there's that same old Doctrine just
[1:32:39] another wording for it two Lords are
[1:32:41] just another wording for Two
[1:32:43] Souls that's right and all of you know
[1:32:46] the two Lord
[1:32:50] man but yet I'm
[1:32:54] sorry I just don't agree with
[1:32:58] it I just maybe I'm lost you stuck with
[1:33:02] me for another
[1:33:03] year okay let's Stand Together come on
[1:33:06] Brothers you stuck with me for another
[1:33:08] year so don't worry about it right I'll
[1:33:11] try to do the best I
[1:33:13] can you don't have the
[1:33:16] communion just yeah we don't have no
[1:33:18] singing we're just going to have to
[1:33:20] commun about to forget
[1:33:24] that see think on these things now we do
[1:33:28] one thing for sure that we always do we
[1:33:30] always give time to you know if anybody
[1:33:34] wants to be prayed for or anything we
[1:33:37] here to come but let's just saying only
[1:33:40] believe if anybody has a need you can
[1:33:42] come to the altar we pray with you pray
[1:33:44] for you then we'll take communion when
[1:33:46] we get through them right
[1:33:50] only
[1:33:59] all things are
[1:34:03] possible
[1:34:15] only
[1:34:20] be
[1:34:29] okay we're going into the scripture 1
[1:34:31] Corinthians
[1:34:33] 11:23 for I have received of the Lord
[1:34:35] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:34:37] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:34:38] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:34:41] when he had given thanks he broke it and
[1:34:43] said take it eat this is take eat this
[1:34:45] is my body which is broken for you this
[1:34:48] do in remembrance of me after the same
[1:34:50] manner also so he took the cup when he
[1:34:52] had s saying this cup is the New
[1:34:54] Testament in my blood this doe ye as of
[1:34:57] as you drink it in remembrance of me for
[1:35:00] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:35:01] this cup you do sh the Lord's death till
[1:35:04] he
[1:35:05] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:35:08] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:35:10] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:35:12] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:35:13] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:35:16] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:35:18] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:35:20] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:35:22] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:35:24] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:35:26] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:35:28] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:35:30] when we are judged we are chasen to the
[1:35:32] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:35:34] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:35:36] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:35:38] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:35:42] eat at home that you come not together
[1:35:44] under condemnation the rest will I set
[1:35:46] in order when I come you know like we
[1:35:50] were saying and reading this morning
[1:35:51] about
[1:35:53] Paul and the believing of the word you
[1:35:56] know none of the disciples were chosen
[1:35:58] to
[1:35:59] record the fact of the
[1:36:03] communion right but Paul coming along
[1:36:07] out of due season and God opened the
[1:36:09] word to him from all of the topes and
[1:36:12] the shadows and the things and then he
[1:36:15] spoke in communion so it did unfold into
[1:36:18] deeper things when so he did open their
[1:36:20] understanding and even teaching things
[1:36:22] to
[1:36:23] come it's a wonderful thing in it so
[1:36:26] let's just have a few minutes of Silent
[1:36:27] prayer making ready to where we can all
[1:36:30] take the communion you know and just
[1:36:32] Fellowship together around
[1:36:45] it we thank you for all things Lord and
[1:36:48] we commit them unto you believing you
[1:36:51] thank you for Thy word the truth that we
[1:36:54] have and we believe
[1:36:55] you just be with each and every one of
[1:36:57] us make us worthy to take the communion
[1:36:59] Lord because none of us are worthy cuz
[1:37:01] there's no way to be worthy in ourselves
[1:37:03] but is what you have made
[1:37:05] us and not we ourselves we love you and
[1:37:08] we thank you in Jesus
[1:37:13] name the Bible said he took bread and
[1:37:16] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:37:18] bread it's went through the time ready
[1:37:20] now for us to take we know it's only a
[1:37:23] symbol yet in that symbol of great
[1:37:25] things can take place if we really
[1:37:27] believe it because it is an ordinance
[1:37:29] given unto us and we believe it we ask
[1:37:32] you now to sanctify the bread and the
[1:37:34] partakers in Jesus
[1:37:50] name
[1:37:53] it was a broken body yes it was not a
[1:37:56] round
[1:37:57] wafer looking in the Kingdom's tap the
[1:38:01] other day and you
[1:38:02] can you can order communion stuff and
[1:38:07] and they'll send you a little cup and
[1:38:10] it's already pre filled it's
[1:38:12] everything's ready and it's got a little
[1:38:14] wafer lay on top of it and you just got
[1:38:17] it every bit there and you just hand out
[1:38:20] those little cups
[1:38:22] everybody just got their own doings but
[1:38:25] that's not correct right you know and
[1:38:30] naturally they don't have wine they have
[1:38:32] grape juice
[1:38:35] and the people would differ with us and
[1:38:37] say you mean y'all take wine yes we take
[1:38:40] wine right but it's not right to
[1:38:43] drink
[1:38:45] well don't take your if you think it's
[1:38:48] wrong to to drink a little supp of wine
[1:38:50] then when you get to coughing real bad
[1:38:53] like I've been at it don't drink no
[1:38:55] cough
[1:38:56] syrup because a lot of it's 18%
[1:38:59] alcohol and the wine we make here is
[1:39:02] probably very very low even below beer
[1:39:04] is only 12% I think something in that
[1:39:07] order so don't be so super religious you
[1:39:09] know father we thank you for this Lov
[1:39:12] and Grace offering that you've made for
[1:39:14] each and every one those that you did
[1:39:15] one day pour out your blood for us this
[1:39:18] is only a symbol of it where the wine
[1:39:20] Lord represented because it's a
[1:39:22] stimulation we'll eat the bread we'll
[1:39:24] drink the wine that becomes cells in our
[1:39:27] body to live off of Lord your spirit
[1:39:30] then would Quicken the word that we have
[1:39:32] heard and we ask you to just bless each
[1:39:35] and every one of us sanctify the wine
[1:39:37] and their partakers now in Jesus name
[1:39:43] amen come
[1:39:46] morning I
[1:39:48] walk by the river
[1:39:54] I'll the
[1:39:57] everen
[1:40:00] tree I'll
[1:40:02] carry my cross through the
[1:40:08] mid come
[1:40:10] morning there's
[1:40:13] glory for
[1:40:16] me sometimes I'm
[1:40:19] despised and and
[1:40:23] rejected and I
[1:40:26] question oh
[1:40:28] Father
[1:40:32] how then I take one more look at Mount
[1:40:38] Calvary I look around and I see the
[1:40:40] world and it falling
[1:40:43] apart and I see that the word said
[1:40:45] that's what would take
[1:40:47] place so then I can be encouraged in my
[1:40:50] spirit
[1:40:51] right and I can see that no I don't want
[1:40:54] this to
[1:40:55] happen but I can see that it
[1:40:58] will that it will come upon
[1:41:03] mankind just because we brought it right
[1:41:06] the prophet said God never destroyed the
[1:41:08] Water World with
[1:41:10] water he said science did
[1:41:14] right sence is one Destro that's right
[1:41:18] excuse
[1:41:19] me but you see we just try to make the
[1:41:24] best we can while we
[1:41:26] here then when it's all over and done
[1:41:28] with Y we no problems here right amen we
[1:41:33] have a wonderful time right I won't be
[1:41:35] coughing over
[1:41:37] there you just pray for me I certainly
[1:41:39] don't want what I did last year you
[1:41:42] remember I had a b hour with a problem
[1:41:45] last year with
[1:41:46] it but I ain't worried about that
[1:41:51] I'm just concerned with serving God am
[1:41:54] and try to be a servant to him and a
[1:41:56] servant to
[1:41:57] you you know to be able to help you and
[1:42:01] to do what we can do for the Lord be
[1:42:04] able to help out as much as we can you
[1:42:06] know out to the world for the people to
[1:42:09] see and hear and they got an opportunity
[1:42:13] to hear and that doesn't mean we're all
[1:42:17] right it just means simply one thing
[1:42:20] that we're trying CU I believe around
[1:42:22] the world that there's a bride of Christ
[1:42:24] a fful Ministry and working in the bride
[1:42:27] of Christ around the
[1:42:29] world and they're bringing God's word
[1:42:33] and I believe that I trust while they're
[1:42:36] finishing up with that I will announce
[1:42:38] this way sister Regina is going to make
[1:42:40] up a kind of a little board cuz she
