want to see amen amen you want to see him and then look into his word it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turnning your scriptures turn back where we've been reading from Psalms 118 and then we'll go to Colossians 1 Psalms 118 Colossians 1 really had a wonderful time over the weekend I hope you did had a good time with with brother fellowshipping and everything with him and in great time in his ministry and preaching unto us and really appreciate it I want to thank again everybody for all of the food the work that was done the things that was you know around and done and and all we certainly do appreciate it amen you know it's it turned out real good everybody got fed good in one of the largest meetings I guess we've had here in the bases especially the fellowship meetings about they said 139 I think it was here so we were packed up amen and but we we just appreciate that Psalms 118 and Colossians 1 remember of my wife she's still having problems she's going back to the doctor or going to the doctor tomorrow maybe to get the uh the Staples out and it'll give her more mobility and everything and pray that the Lord would touch her am man I hope they're able to connect to on we've had the most U problems and fun too I guess trying to hook on a internet system when they did finally get DSL over to our house and and then we thought well it just hook right on well now it's up and down up and down so anything that's the prophet said that Satan fights is generally right so you know we hope that it'll work out to where we'll have it set up correctly okay amen father we thank you for your love love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day thank you for the opportunity to be able to come together this afternoon we ask that you would just bless us now with your presence and that Lord you may come among us and that father that you would open your word unto us because that's the way we believe that you are now revealing yourself is through the revealed word we thank you and we ask you to Just Have Your Way touch our wife there Lord and deliver her and remember the sick among us and let your light shine and each one of our hearts forgive our sins and Lord just cleanse us from all unrighteousness and help us to walk in you we commit it all to you now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord unto which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou Hast heard me and art become my Sal salvation the stone which the builders refuse is become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord let's go over to Colossians 1 we'll begin reading about verse 10 that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful and never good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meat to be protect Akers of the inheritance of the S of the light of the Saints in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins now who is this one we're talking about who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of ever creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were made by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist we'll stop there because in the next message your show will go on down into the rest you may be seated the Lord have his bless add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking about for quite a while we have a lot of quot Folks up here and I'm sure we will not be able to get to all of them but we'll try because I have a point that I want you to see and uh you know I want you to listen to it as I try to express it and then you know that's as much as I can do it's up to God to reveal it unto you now I had a little experience I told way about it yesterday I had a little experience this week and I've been burdened about something about the the uh the way I preach and the things and trying to do and you know for about close to 40 years right and it has been a burden because a lot of people have rejected what I've tried to preach and uh I always burdened me because I thought I could maybe in some way I could have presented it a different way uh made it you know U more understandable and all but I I've tried and I'll keep on trying to be able to break down what I believe the Lord has given us but you know I was praying about it and everything and sitting downstairs doing some corn and and uh uh all at once something just spoke to me and said they didn't understand right what she was just saying exactly right and that's all that was said but you know that lifted that burden amen right you said well that was not very much to be said might not for you but uh it has a lot of meaning to me but cuz I've tried to make myself clear and tried to preach I've never tried to preach nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified and uh I've never tried to preach nothing but the revealed word of the hour and the things that that you know the prophet has brought unto us and uh you know it's it's just uh I've tried and I believe the Lord would just saying okay they just don't understand what you're talking about cuz you see you'll see that more tonight in the message if you'll listen to the point I'm going to try to make you'll see more about what I'm saying because in Colossians there now it's the only time the word visible is used in the scriptures that I can find now invisible is used a lot of times and and things and and it has no other um anyone listening uh it has no other carryover to go into another u words like other things says but uh that's what we want to talk about we want to talk about how that God can become visible Among Us and will'll be able to raise the dead I gave you the quote and we'll go in Rapture GL have our brother back there with us uh we always say to you when you come one time around here you're a visitor you come two times you're part of us so we don't join anything we're just part of the body of Christ so don't expect to get welcomed again just always one time for you that's because if you don't make yourself welcomed it's your problem all right but now as I said the word visible I gave you some quotes and I quoted it many times times over and over is number three on your notes there where the prophet of God and what was the Holy Ghost given for 59 he said that God would become visible Among Us and raise the dead and we go into Rapture right well see that's easy for um someone who believes in a literal physical coming right of the body you know of the Lord Jesus Christ but we know that's not true right because we meet him in the air so now if we meet him in the air he's not coming back here in a physical body because as I've always tried to say to you that if he came now in a physical body then uh it would be breaking the scriptures because we're his body right we are the body of Christ it goes on down there in Colossians but we want to hold off a little bit on that because we'll get on to some other things with it but see to become visible most everybody says you know you talk to people about the Bible and they'll say well the Bible says well all right that's good you know I'm glad we can read but now what it says on the literal word has to be understood by the text or context every which one you would place it as to what it's being used in amen like the prophet of God talking about our English language is so messed up and I agree that like he said you can take the word board and you can use it for for uh a plank on a on on a you know a board that you step on or or you can use it come on board or or you can say pay your bored uh or you can s I'm bored with you well now uh to me then the only way you'll understand what that's being said is to know what text it's in right now if I'm wrong on that text or context I don't have the English and I'm not educated enough to know so you put it in there but see the before and The Afters have always said to you explains it right all right see so you read the before and the after and I say to you I say now brother Gary Come on board stand on this board and pay your board because I'm bored with you and he knows exactly what I'm talking about that's right right the words that I'm using is telling you what you know what I mean and that's the way it is with God's word so then that way you don't read it like a newspaper you read it waiting upon God to speak to you and show you what he wants us to hear so now strongest concordance which is a definition in words on in your Bible it says that visible is something that is open to The View open to the view Webster Your Dictionary says that is is that can be seen perceptible in other words which you can look at you know perceive it to the eye it means apparent you know a p p a r e n t or it means manifest or something that's obvious all right now parent means to to be exposed to sight visible capable of easily being perceived or understood all right now we read here that this one that we're talking about is the image of the invisible God right all right now we used to be trinitarians are we used to be God in three person trinitarians right well we didn't have much trouble with that because we thought we understood what it was saying right cuz we thought it was one person and another person look like them you know so we'd say father and son you know we we thought we really hadn't figured out but then when we come to the conclusion to realize that that's not what it's saying amen when that word there in verse 15 it was used the image that means an exact likeness amen image see now as I said we use our words as image and we try to take something to make an image of it but the irregardless of how much you could do you could take this bottle and you could try in every way you could do to make an exact image of that bottle and you know it can never be done right even the best they can do with the uh um machines today to be able to put something in it and draw it out to bring it out it is still limited to the point that there can be a slight flaw right you agree am you see I'm going to make an image of this I'm going to take those drums home home and I'm going to build me a set of drums exactly like that drum well I can't do it I can get as close as I can but I can never make it exactly well all right then if that's true in the natural that's right like I remember brother hress was a machinist and he said you know you take a gear and the gear gets all worn out well brother the boy and them would understand and you go down to a place and and you tell a man and you hand it to him said I want a gear just like this one no that's not what the man wants that's right right right right he doesn't want one like that right that one's worn out right he wants one like that one was that's right but see in God now that's why we believe in one true and living God Amen Jesus said if you seen me you seen the father that's right amen so he's not one in another likeness come on he's God revealing himself in another form right he revealed himself to the children of Israel as father you know Pillar of Fire and all that then he was in flesh the scripture said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily amen amen and now the Holy Ghost is living in his church it's the same God right amen so then he's not another person that's right and living in you is not another person right now so then when you get on down to the the fact of him talking about that all that is visible and invisible whether in heaven or whether in Earth was made by him amen by him who the word am all right the word made all things things right amen that's why John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God verse 14 said and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's right all right amen now that's why we believe in one true and living God that's right that God changed his form Amen to appear down through time he would change his form to be whatever the age needed right right now I'm trying to make a little background so hang on to that so then if you're talking about something that is open to view now remember maybe you wouldn't understand this statement but I had rather have God to speak to me about what he has in his word written down for me to understand now listen than for me to physically see him right right now see you may not believe it that way but that's the way I do see you say oh if I physically see no no Satan can impersonate all of those things and he could come into an a form that I would be all confused about but yet if he Reveals His word then he and his word are one so now we're going to talk about how that God can be visible but not here in a Corporal body right not here as a mortal being you know like we are but he can be here that is more real than we are cuz that's what we don't look at you mean this would that this pull pit is made out of is more real than God's word that made it no right right amen because God's word can make another tree this tree this wood can't make another piece of wood no more it's done gone too far it can't be done huh but now think about it see something that can become apparent in other words something that can become to where that you can see it right you said but you can't see God brother Dale well why not amen it's according to how you're looking well the Bible says no man has seen God at any time but it also says Jesus Christ declared it right now are you going to fight one scripture with the other if he declared it that means he brought him out into the open right so we're not going to argue words or anything I'm just getting a point to you that being visible Among Us means a great thing all right now so we're going to have to be real slow about that and that's what I intend to be to be visible then is not physical mortal this way but it means that it can be revealed right amen it can be revealed God can be revealed right right if we don't believe that what do we believe the new birth is a revelation am to you a revelation of that God has accepted you right and giving you his own life right so then I want something that I can see by Revelation apparent to the ey see other words I can see it right but now just holding that point to a revelation I know that's basically the words you jump with when you talk about something apparent to the eye something that can be understood and all of that and you say well well that's a revelation well now this is where we're going to get into something that we need a revelation we need something to be revealed to us about this because God is visible here in the last days in a greater way than he was down Through the Ages amen would you agree amen that's right well now then if it's that's true and you're only using the word uh a v you know as visible as being a revelation then you're going to lose where Martin Luther and them had the new birth right and you're going to do like a lot of people of the message has done and I'll read it to you in just a minute that they've used the the thought of Alpha and Omega that he was back there in the book of Acts and then he'll be here in the last days but he's not in between well now what kind of a god do you have so if you use the word revelation and not only you're not going to get the understanding of what we're going to try to get into for a minute and just read a little bit and then just look at it and see what we're talking about so listen to what your Prophet had to say look at number four on your notes number three is where he said that he would become visible Among Us raise the dead and we'll go into Rapture now watch what he says proof of his resurrection 55 4 4:10 the morning service listen he's talking about Mary Magdalene and Martha coming to the grave and the things say first early that morning Christ showed himself visible among the early risers and then he never showed it anymore through the span of the day until the evening time so now he's perfectly in scripture right then he made himself known again for he was Alpha and Omega it'll be light in the evening time the path of Glory you surely find huh so now what's he saying when Jesus rose from the dead and Mary and Martha saw him it was early in the morning right all right and then read your scripture he's not seen anymore throughout the day but he's seen at evening time when he comes and appears among them all right so now there's your your thought of what the prophet is saying he never showed it anymore through the span of time until the evening time right why because he's Alpha and he's Omega right now just going down a little bit to about number 6A on your notes the baptism of the Holy Ghost 1958 uh 9:28 the morning service look what he's saying he's talking about the right hand and the left hand the Candlestick the darkness and how that it goes and he says not in the Alpha and Omega not the in between the Alpha and Omega had his hand stretched out now in that quote it looks like he's saying that he's not in between so that one was used by a lot of people in the message to say he was God in the early church but then he was not God down through time he was just you know some kind of anointing some little something that was there but in the evening time he would come back to be the same now we're going to get that to that in a minute but go on down that was 1958 928 now 1960 1206 I'm earning Church age he said he's both the Alpha and Omega and of course all was in between it too all the other letters but he specifically said Alpha and Omega had a rainbow over his head and all that's over in the Book of Revelation right now so we know the prophet is not saying one thing in one place another thing in another place he is trying to describe what he has said that he is Alpha and Omega all right the outstretched arms of the Cross reaching out see the church ages the symbolics the the Book of Revelations would come out to be Alpha and Omega saying what just like he was saying about the Alpha and Omega when he was talking about the resurrection that there he was the early morning they saw him then he's not seen for a while in a physical form like but then in the even evening time he's seen right so that's we see is what God is trying to do he's going to make himself visible he was there visible look on over to 6 C I guess you'd call it look on to the next page it says Masterpiece 1964 7045 the Alpha and Omega is the same he said I am Alpha and Omega he never never say anything in between I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last that's it now what's he explaining looks like he's contrary to one quote to the other quote no it's not the before and the after read it because the before and the after of brother random is the fact that he didn't change if he did he told you about it am I've heard this argued and argued about people and I said well what is what was God in those ages in between oh he just down to there well see they don't know nothing about it because according to my Bible he's Hebrews 13:8 which says that he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen whatever he was he is amen whatever he is he was and will forever be right or you've missed the scripture right but see now I want just trying to make a point to you look what he goes on to say he says said the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the second life's message is the same thing right now the first Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ which when he was walking upon this earth right he brought a Ministry for three and A2 years right all right now then you come up to the book of Acts and you'll find that they had the ministry of Jesus Christ in the book of Acts but they had some things that was not present there that would be in the end time I what I want you to look at for a minute now in the book of Acts I gave you quotes down to there and they were in it that that they had the same Ministry of Jesus Christ in the apostles that's on down number eight on your notes exactly like they always did see the same Ministry in the apostles that's so you that's why we have a a thought and always try to talk about that what that we must be restored back to the faith of the fathers that's what Malachi 4 says turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers faith is the revelation right so we are to be returned in the last days back to the revelation of the Apostles right now there you got to say the same Ministry everybody just looking for the same Ministry that Jesus had while he was walking here to come back and it cannot take place because you would do not have any foundation for it to rest upon oh it's just the same Ministry no you can't do it because there was some things the Lord Jesus talked about that none of the disciples knew anything about show me one scripture where any of the disciples outside of the Matthew Mark Luke and John now that said one word about the son of man they didn't understand it right but yet the Lord Jesus constantly said Son of Man son of man who man say I son of man am they didn't understand it why because it was withholden from them but then in the end times see to come back that we're to coming back to the son of man to understand but if you don't see that the same Ministry has got to be among us that was in the book of Acts amen you don't have any foundation you don't have anything you're standing out in midair in the gospel we see the same Lord Jesus Christ that was in the book of Acts has got to be back here now that's what I'm talking about the coming of the Lord that's why I've been trying to preach it to you 10 sermons now that the coming of the Lord is a revealing of his word and that he started his second coming where on the day of Pentecost amen that's right mhm he was heing his first coming he started his second coming on the day of Pentecost amen but we're still in we're still in the part of his coming because we haven't went up to meet him in the air right because that will climax the second coming to you and I so they in the the thing is what we' got to have the faith of the fathers right right if we don't have the faith of the fathers then you you can't go on like I've always tried to describe it to you if something is required to be but yet there's a vast Gap in between how you going to get there right see I know we talk on strange terms and strange languages but to newcomers and things and but just remember we've been doing this 40 years yeah but see I'm talking about the Lord Jesus Christ right but the same one who walked the shores of Galilee right when he gave his life right that Holy Ghost that was in him that's right came back on the day of Pentecost amen and there was God manifest then in a group of people right amen whereas at the start it was God manifested in one human body you know right that started his second coming right so what are you looking for in his second coming oh this clouds are going to split it's going to go up the Eastern skies and all this to to to with the horns and all that no I thought it was going to be a secret coming come on amen I didn't think CNN was going to know about this or CVS or any other I thought it was going to be a secret coming I thought the scripture said that he would come as a thief in the night right now thief in the night don't broadcast on the CNN who he's going to rob right right but you see that's what we're talking about the revealing of Jesus Christ back Di and it started on the day of Pentecost where that he placed within them exactly what they needed for the day amen and he gave them his ministry that he had had right right amen but there was some things that he didn't tell them he didn't tell them when he was coming right he didn't tell them those things he withheld that right see it would be a mystery then as I was trying to bring out the other day but there's a difference in the what in the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord cuz he can appear anywhere right but his coming is in the hearts of the Saints right amen he said well I thought it was this and I thought it was yeah that's what a lot of people think they think it was brother randam that stood here and I don't believe it I don't believe he was God no that would mess up the scriptures let me quote him to you if you think brother brandom was God let me quote him and I don't have to go through all of the big quotes to to lay it in your La he said if you say that you have oil on your forehead and blood in your hands and things he said you're denying the fact of his coming because you're saing he's here in a Corporal body and he said that's wrong Jo brother randam was him that would have messed the whole thing up that's why we don't believe it sure we believe he was the prophet of God that God used right but he was not God people say well brother randam was my God be careful what you're saying because he was not our God he was God's Prophet Amen to bring us the message right now he was not the coming of the Lord he was the one that God would use to speak and tell us what his coming is amen that's right a lot of difference in it amen the before and after clears up a lot of things doesn't it but you understand what I'm trying to say that he would become visible right invisible means that someone would be able to see it right that's right now that's what I'm trying to describe right so look at it but if we don't have the faith of the fathers then we don't know anything about the second coming of Jesus Christ right come on that's just simple as I can make it right we don't know understand the faith of the fathers and don't have the faith of the fathers we're not even in line for the second coming because we don't know what it is right because we're like the organized religion you know what you mentioned to organized religion about the mysteries in the Bible and because I come through there you know what they'll say well that's what Paul talked about the mystery the engrafted of the Gentiles well that's true that was a mystery that was sealed in the Old Testament that no one knew that the Gentiles was going to come in to the Plan of Redemption but yet God spoke of it by bringing in Rahab to harlot bringing in the different ones that were Ruth and Boaz he began to speak of those things but then one day see he spoke of it and like Isaiah and him saying that be known of a people that are not my people y but then one day the door was open to the Gentiles to be able to come in right so it was a mystery yes but it's not the mystery of all Mysteries you see in the end time we're to understand that there's got to be there's got to be a group of people that come to the Statue of a perfect man that we talk about add to your faith virt knowledge temper praise and come up to where the faith of the fathers exist and then we can speak of the coming of the Lord right but you see we know so much you we think yeah and it's just like it was years ago and I know this offended people and it'll offend you again but I was trying to preach on a Doctrine years ago that where they were trying to preach about the son of man I asked as a simple question here in the church and I said when I say son of God what do you think of and everybody here said 2,000 years ago on the shores of Galilee I said there's no need of talking about son of man till we understand Son of God so I immediately dropped off of that and to begin to preach the Son of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if we didn't know that that is not the first time the son of God came into being the Son of God was the word that created all things and that would be the logos that went out of God in the beginning the very Breath of God would be called The Son of God H but you see cuz people think they know everything but then when we turn down what someone is trying to bring on a subject you know and that was what I was worried about and burden see is to see people turn down what you're talking about right see I can't help it because I do the best I can it's up to God to reveal but now listen the same Ministry that Jesus gave those Apostles which was Christ in you Paul said the hope of glory amen they went forth and even in the the scripture there they were called Christians at Antioch why because they were Christlike right not that they look like him no they were living like him amen and God was using them to manifest himself among the people that's and they were called Christians in other words they were saying Jesus Christ is here again y right in the faith of the fathers then you find the revelation of the fathers they had the understanding of one true and living God Paul having the greater understanding of all of them even though Peter says he says things hard to be understood to they that are learned rational at what he's doing you know in other words you you you can't understand what he's talking about right he was trying to speak to him what God was revealing to him and he said not a one of you guys added anything to what I said and they couldn't argue with him but still Paul didn't have the understanding to be able to bring it back in the end time right so God would wait amen and bring it so what was he he was in the first church he was in the book of Acts are you going to say that was not God no he was there right then when the Holy Ghost came down on zeusa street and started there 1906 and started the the the Holy Ghost himself coming back into the church your Prophet says the ministry of Jesus Christ like the apostles had is here now right of course everybody said oh yeah it was in brother brandham but he said it was in the church right amen but you see if that book of Acts is not in you and I there's no even need of even talking about the coming of the Lord cuz we can't comprehend it right the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word and there was things he did not reveal to those Apostles that's right so the same ministry's got to be here then in the end time that was in the book of Acts before you can talk about the same Ministry that brother randam had are you listening see people are say well brother R had that Ministry and we got it where's it at you can't even keep together what are he saying right is they going off for all kind of doctrines because they can't even keep together what he was just saying well brother L what are you talking about I'm talking about I believe that like it was at thir to Resurrection in the early church God was there with them but as it came down through the Dark Ages God was still there just like he was when he was with the children of Israel and all of their sins and things that was taking place God was still there with them right he was right there hovered over them amen and with them amen they were the ones that didn't see him he was still guiding and leading them but they' lost lost the understanding of his leadership so did they down to the ages and come out with denominationalism come out then forming churches and don't get me wrong God was using them amen Martin Luther when he preached the just shall live by faith turned the world upside down amen thank God for the truth that he brought amen thank God for what John Wesley amen all of those men brought thank God for it we wouldn't know what we're doing today that's right the Baptist restored baptism by mer mercing right you know going down up each one had its own thing to restore but see in the end time then we got to come back to the faith of the fathers amen amen we got to come back to the Revelation they had but now listen intellectual concept is not Revelation right amen that's right to say we are here doesn't mean we're here right it's what it does I'm here I ain't talking about that right to say we have the faith of the fathers without having the Revelation that the fathers had would immediately show we were wrong correct that's right we believing in the Trinity and they believed in one God you automatically know that that's not there but it's also the same God that was there has to be among us right amen doing the things right that he done there right but you see that's where the people at today though they can't see God Among the people today that's right but yet you can't deny that you turn on a TV and see the denominations and having healings and signs and wonders and you tell me they're not I'll tell you you you sure have messed up a lot cuz they have signs and wonders Among Us right well if they do that means they're Among Us also right if we believe it amen but if we don't believe it it can't be made right that's right ain't no need you getting up coming up here and asking me to pray for you if you don't believe God's in me come on right I you might as well stay and you seat right but if you believe God will meet you here you come up here God will meet you here that's right amen what do you believe that's right what would have to happen for you to believe it come on well so and so so and so well that's that's what they told Jesus if you be God come down off the cross right if you be God we've got a whole graveyard full of dead people up here come here and raise them up and we'll believe you now he knew they wouldn't believe you so we would no need go to raise a graveyard right it's not the fact that he couldn't do it right right he could have done it but he knew they wouldn't believe right see God don't play but see the the same Ministry that Jesus had then he put it in the early church and they had the signs and the Wonders and that lasted for about four Church ages through there great things taking place but they didn't have to die and go in the ground because that's what Jesus said l a corner we die and go into the ground and L alone but said if it dies and goes to ground it come forth and the multiplied for amen that was speaking of him but he died when when he did he come back on the day of Pentecost in 120 at one time then 3,000 at another right but he was also speaking of the church ages that the bride would have to go in the ground and come out right right you see we're in a restoration we're not in Reformation we're in restoration and see restoration requires Revelation amen Reformation it can be done on a lot of times you can reform yourself go down to alcoholic synonymous right they'll talk you out of drinking right but they won't deliver you that's right they won't deliver you they'll talk you out of it but that's Reformation not saying Luther and westle them didn't have anything cuz they did that's my point they had God am amen they had God among them y but he was going into the ground to where he could come out but if we don't come back to the faith of the fathers then where are we going right but if we don't believe that the faith of the fathers is here God can never make it manifest right that's right amen he's waiting on you and I amen that quote I gave you there to start with where he said he become visible Among Us read it read it where he says he waiting on you and I the church is in the grave is waiting on you and I to what to first start saying it right amen we got to say it before he can make it manifest right now come on am I in the scripture what does the scripture say man believe in his heart no it didn't just say that says he saved he got to confess with his mou yes sir right there's a two-part there of it you believe in your heart but if you won't confess with your mouth right like brother R told that time the you said that lady said told the other one said I got the Holy Ghost the other night spoke in tongues but don't you tell nobody she didn't get it that's right cuz the Bible said believing in your heart fine but you got to confess with your mouth well you got to confess it before you can possess but no we're figh going opposite direction we're saying if it come here then we'll confess it no we got to confess it amen that's right we've got to confess it before it can be made manifest well why can't we start saying that the same God that was in the book of Acts is here today right and of course then when I try to explain it everybody thinks that I'm saying that that you know that uh trying to explain it away no I'm just truthful and that's what people are getting away from the truth that's what I was telling the Lord told me he said you told him the truth right the truth is you bring them Apostles down here and they got problems fooling with what we got right amen they had a Pharisees and the Sadducees right right no denominational doctrines we got 969 plus 10,000 in this message afterward oh that's right right right you said well that's trying to justify no that's not justified that's just telling you standing right right we're standing here in a situation that we got to overcome that thought of our mind right amen right we got to overcome the point of thinking we don't have it right why brother around tell that man when he prayed for him that was blind right he told him he said go say in your heal right go tell everybody you can see right well now I don't want I don't want to lie because I'm still blind no you're a liar when you say God ain't already healed you don't worry about lying you're already a liar when you say God ain't healed you you're lying right CU my Bible says by Stripes I am already healed right I'm going to be right but he's waiting on me to say it right yeah so the man begin to go out he came back you know and he said don't you told me i' healed he said are you doubting said go say it right remember he's selling papers out on the side of the street think he went in to get a haircut or something didn't he a shave or something man was kind of breing light of him and don't you said you can see he said I can see about that time his eyes open he went running out in the street right hard and there everybody well now what if he hadn't said that right amen what if he hadn't said he could see he die blind right God's waiting on you and I you want to make him visible make his word visible that's it right there amen amen make his word to be word that there's no possibility of it failing amen amen that's right there's not no failures in this Bible right amen I told you show me one one time remember some was coming up with this one and some was coming up with that one I said show me one believer in the Bible has ever failed that's right am I said the greatest one I know of is Saul where he turned against God right he denied him gave went down to the witch of indor and all the things but I said after all was said and done when Samuel come up he said Saul you will be with me the day in paradise right he was not a failure amen theyve never been a believer in the Bible that was a failure but every believer has to confess it right you got to confess with your mouth what you believe in your heart right well I kind of believe sister Gale that we're in the end don't you now let me announce we are amen the government sure ain't got nothing to do with it they sure ain't help us right you to it like a brother said there the other day they got them camps waiting on us them old nuts and Fanatics up there in Alaska and all right they got places for us but you see they can't get us to God gets through with us right amen it can't bother us brother Mark until God gets through with us then when he gets to with us I ain't worried about it I remember one time reading a story about that these people were going to take some cattle or something they were going to Alaska horses and stuff like that you know and they they thought well man they'll freeze to death when we get there so so they spent a lot of time making them all great big coats and quilts and things to hang over the animals you know but you know by the time they got through marching them there they come to find out they didn't need no hair to put on right they'd already growed it real thick right and they could live see we just get in the way right amen and get our smart ly bored I don't know about board which board are you talking about well I done told you come on board pay your board cuz I'm bored with you that's enough the before and the after explains it the before back there the after we get out of here and what's in between God Almighty making himself manifest among the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time get her to believe it right maam I just don't see it well that means you don't have it either right amen come on if you don't see it you don't have it right right so somebody comes along to you and start saying well I just don't see it well I say all right you're the number one you don't have it that's right amen he said well a lot of people said we have it don't have it no but there's a lot of people said we had it had it too right Martin Luther thought he had it mhm y right that's right he's a great Catholic priest he thought he had it but you know one day the Lord revealed to him the just shall live by faith you know he walked out of there and he didn't say what I used to have or anything he said I got it right that's right I like what the prophet said about what the scripture said this is that right this is that that was broken up all right if this ain't that let me say this till that get here that's right because if we don't say this that can't come that's right if we don't say we're healed we can't be healed right we don't say we're saved we can't be saved if we don't say we have the faith of the fathers we can never have it right amen and if we don't say that we're already changed it can never take place you mean you're going to say you're changed and standing here well you going to you tell me how it's going to come then come on pull pits open come on right amen it sure ain't going to come with our stupidity it's going to come by somebody saying it right somebody's going to speak it it'll take place that's right well the prophet of God is already spoken amen but he's waiting on somebody to say what he say like I've tried my best to preach to you how Joshua was Joshua told them people go down there and walk around them wall one time a day for seven days right he said then on the seventh day you walk seven times and keep your mouth shut until you finish that seventh time and said then turn around and face that wall you know where Joshua was at up on the hillside watch it you said that ain't in the Bible will you show me where he was against the wall it ain't in there either come on I'm too old to play with Words With You Joshua told him what to do when they done what he said do the walls came down right when Joshua told him what to do the walls never fail but when he told them what to do and they done what he said and shouted what he said those Great Walls of ground just opened up and they just went right down in the ground didn't crumble over just went right down in the ground after all is said and done everybody was glad Joshua said that wasn't it but you know what Joshua was glad that he had a group of people that could go down there and say what he said right amen that's all I've ever said about this message is this prophet of God is laying in the ground up here in Jeffersonville Indiana waiting on you and I right to reach that place in faith that can draw him out of that ground right now see everybody else got most of them got their hopes on he's going to come back and then he's going to do something for us well show me that in the scripture right well that's the great mystery I know it that's a mystery that I can't put to before and after the work bless him come on you know what I mean by that amen I can't say come on board pay you bored cuz I'm bored I can't say that cuz I can't find that in the Bible that he's supposed to come back and speak us a glorified body come on I thought your Prophet my Prophet said your glorified body was built around your Born Again experience right that's what he told us right if you want to call it speaking the body he he already done it right but you know what before the world Jesus Christ has already spoken right the invisible has become visible amen if you can see it right if you can see it but see we only deal with the same Ministry of Jesus Christ as talking about brother brandom with the gifts of discernments and the resurrection sign Etc well your Prophet covered the day of Pentecost as the ministry of Jesus Christ and he covered that the ministry of Jesus Christ would have to come again in the end time right as the faith of the fathers amen then we can walk off of this earth right he's going to become visible Among Us folks right right by the revealed word amen by the revealed word you tell me how else it's going to take place can't come on show me some other way give me a rabbit and hat trick or something to get us out of here but no it won't work that's why we've been here 40 something years that's right after the prophets come why because the people won't say what the prophet said that's right well yeah that's right brother that all right here in Lula Georgia right I Don't Preach somewhere else I'm preaching to me and you anybody else listens to it that's up to you I preach to my people you want the benefits of it you know where the church is at ain't no argument with nobody about I never invited none of you to come but you see I'm trying to preach God's word right cuz only in the revealed word can we come out to an end time right but only through the end the revealed word can we see the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word right I still hav't got to the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout yet have I no no we got another message or two before then I guess but I'm just trying to get you to look at something tonight right you said I don't see him it's because you can't open your eyes eyes right you can't show a blind man that's right now here's our problem folks I don't call all those blind okay I I always get this messed up and I can't remember which one's nearsighted and which one's farsighted cuz they tell me farsighted you can see farsighted and nearsighted you can see nearsighted or something I can't get it straight all right I'll just put it in plain old Georgia language there's a lot of people got that need some glasses to be able to see it along range for a little while right to be able to look out and see further than the end of your nose and to see Jesus Christ is coming into our lives and our our beings right amen then when it gets closer we don't need no glasses right that's right you start out needing a set of telescopes right brother Gary you want to answer the rest of it for him he said I see this I said uh you just opened the door right he said I see the end I said no no no no no you just started in the other end of the tunnel yeah you just got your B your you got rid of your little glasses and got you a set of binoculars to be able to see something out there with right so you look to that until it gets where it gets blurred when it gets blurred you know what it means it's too close you lay it down then you look then you might I have to put your glasses on and look I used to get the Tickle at an old man down there at work me and him work together I get the Tickle at him and he had he wore glasses and when he get in that little stuff he take his glasses off and lay them down boy he get down the world I said why in the world you wearing far he said I can't see I'm there right well I think that's our problem folks we can't see no further in the end of our nose oh my come on I believe the revealing of his word don't you right amen you say well brother Dale it can only be that we've got it intellectually now I want that explained that's all I want I want it explained that you can preach the mysteries of God listen I know the scriptures I know what it says that you can understand all Mysteries right now if you want to make me an unbeliever go right ahead because I'm going to say something to you Paul was not saying that you had a revelation of the Mysteries he was saying you had an intellectual concept he was not saying you could understand by Revelation the Mysteries he was saying you could have an intellectual conception right now because if you say he was saying you had a revelation you got a problem but you see sure I can stand up your name off I was thinking about it the other day and thought kind of how to bring a message to unbelievers you know I mean people that didn't believe and then you could explain this and explain this and explain this and explain this and explain this and explain that and you just keep explaining the things of the Bible Well I can do that intellectually sure can't right I knew that intellect amen after the prophet told me right right you see what I'm putting it after the prophet told me about these Mysteries we can now now down to the ages they couldn't explain the mysteries of the Bible now come on that's why I'm talking about the Alpha and Omega because he's visible here in the end time there was no part no down through there they couldn't explain the Mysteries right you show me they did they didn't do it they couldn't explain the Mysteries the Mysteries was to wait till the end time right but now I can tell you about the mistress cuz brother randam told me how to tell it y you know I can read that's right but now when it's revealed to you right amen you don't have to worry about it at all amen and the best way to do that is one thing and I know what you think so go ahead you find somebody that's got a revelation and let somebody try to explain to me Mysteries to it if you got a mystery of serpent seed revealed to you the letter of it will never do it right you'll go ground somewhere and I'll say hold on right there like I told a man at work one time I said go ahead and show me where I'm wrong but I said when you say something that's not right in the Bible I'm going to hold my hand up I said you got the opportunity to show me he had said two words and I had my hand up he just hushed didn't say no more what was I doing if you got a revelation of the Mysteries right you don't have an intellectual conception only right you know that's right that's why I'm not afraid of any quote on any subject that anybody brings me the prophet of God said it cuz like I gave you there where he says in one quote Alpha and Omega nothing in between then he said Alpha and Omega and everything in between now I say both of them's right amen how could that be because one he was explaining Christ through every age the other he was explaining that God was highly prevalent very visible among his first church age and down true for for a while and then becomes visible again in the end time right I gave you a bunch of quotes where your Prophet said that he'd be visible if you don't like them then you read them but see you say well I don't know about it let me give you a couple more that I didn't put in and then we'll quit message of paradox 19611 1210 and the words he's talking about John 1 one Jesus was the word the Bible says St John 1 Chapter and the words was visible now listen close the word was invisible now listen the word was invisible until it was made flesh right and then the word become visible think about that and through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection ction positionally placed his church in that real that the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the word visible right oh my I wish my church could get that amen if you could see friends the invisible God made visible right amen well see you can't see me if it's not in your heart is that right no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost right not because you studied it some quotes or whatever listen to this one uh go AIT go await Jesus uh 63 11:30 the evening service you might not be able to open your eyes and see him because he's in spirit form right the invisible God but he dwells among among a visible people making him visible by his promised word in that people do you understand that dwells among his people making himself visible through the revealed word I'm looking CU I I didn't ended this I try to get it back you say well brother Dale aren't you looking for greater things to happen yes I believe it but it's only because you and I believe what we're talking about now right we don't believe where it is right now and get that straight and walk on then don't worry about it when it gets over there cuz you're going to laugh and make fun of people and say a that's just anointed ones I've taught you over and over and proved to you by the Bible and Prophets message it'll come a time when gainsayers will be shut up but it'll be too late for the gangs Sayer right it'll be too late which side are we going to be on well so so that's why I've always told you don't make no Li about somebody over in this church getting healed right a they just got emotional work up no don't make no light of that's the Holy Ghost if the person's ever healed God done the healing amen the devil can't heal you can't right that's right say thank you God right am I read in the paper where that that they had a uh somebody done this or pray a prayer and something happened I said Thank You Lord right why because he's God Amen he can appear and do things right but he coming is in Your Heart Right the coming in your heart is the revealing of his word right amen what else are you looking for that's right well it's just intelect I know what I've been called at bless you ask a brother to his face one day I said what do you think about me he said you ain't nothing but a Baptist you wouldn't if you didn't know what he's talking about what I was talking about you wouldn't know what's going on he said you just bring it by the letter you're just bringing the letter of the word man I said well if my letter is lined up better than your spiritual condition that's right I'll just stick with what I got right cuz at least where somewhere God can meet that's right and make it manifest amen because it's the fit the if the seed's not in the ground you're not going to get nothing that's right but you see what I'm talking about right he's going to become visible among us through the revealed word right sure I'm looking for healing and signs and wonders yes I cry and weep every day about my wife because that I didn't come to the place to lay hands on her for her to walk away from that or any of you that are sick and I condemn my own self not you that's one thing this man's never done is look back and said well now if we get straightened up we'd have it right around here l no it wouldn't help me a bit for him to get straight help him won't help me you blame everybody else for it just remember there's a God looking down see everybody wants to put it off all right but let must start saying it amen why can't we say it right cuz I'll show you when I get to it all of those appearing and coming the prophet spoke of was up until 1962 he never used that after them because no longer was he appearing nor neither was he coming that's why he would always say the seventh seal is his coming right you go back and check it it's his coming coming is a process taking place over a period of time right but the word come doesn't mean that right that's why your Prophet said he's here all right you know what God come down and proved it come on God come down and
