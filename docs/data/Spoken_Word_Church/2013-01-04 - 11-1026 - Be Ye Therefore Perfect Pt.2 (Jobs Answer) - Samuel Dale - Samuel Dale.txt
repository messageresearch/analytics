heelys deliver us Lord if we walk in the word so we thank you and that's all we try to do is just just to get to a place to believe you forgive our sins because we want to stand complete lower than you and they're puts to walk upright follow in to follow in your footsteps lead us now bless each and every one the people that are listening and all this have your way with each heart and life and lead us in Jesus name Amen Matthew 25 Matthew 5 excuse me 37 Matthew 5 but let your communication bae a name a for whatsoever is more than these cometh from the coming of evil you have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not that ye resist not evil but what whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue the aetna law and take away thy coat let him have that bloke also and whosoever shall compel thee tis warm I'll go with him 20 give to him that asketh thee and of him that would bar of the tourney now turn not down away you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemies never remember the text of what we started off using this on to show in our natural lives you know he was telling her how it should be we should be this way we should be that way but then it's this is the way God doesn't you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute not persecute that persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven where he maketh the Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you do eat more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect now let's go back to the job we'll get through the scripture in a little bit joke 23 begin reading about the 8th verse read the whole chapter and all this is job's answer back to his three companions buddies as to him and condemning him for being a secret center and everything you know and even one of them said to it you know said you know if you were you think you're perfect but if you're perfect this wouldn't happen to know see there was condemning him because he was you know was in bad shape you know sitting on a seat with all of his friends lost this thing with everything else you know but he says behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot receive him on the left hand where he's at work but God that I cannot behold him he hides himself on the right hand that I cannot see him listen but in no other way that I take we have tried me I shall come forth as gold my foot have held his steps and this is eventually what I've done what he told me to do all right I don't get back to that scripture in the expand on that remember that's what he said my foot have held his steps his way how I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips I have a stain the words of his mouth more than my necessary food you may be seated or that is blessing to the reading of the word this is a thousand percent my brother Ernie going away but it's talking about kind of them setting up a monetary system worldwide systems at all he'll just make you a copy of it you know it's not that it's going to put us into rapture it's the revealed Word and if we do know about those things also all right now I told you we were going to take a little talk for just a few services on jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect we see mankind just like as I said about the people with job jokes that I've offered what God said I've done what the commandments from his lips has declared so I stand on that ground another work I stand here before you condemned by his buddies you know and saying he was a secret Center how could you be perfect job because look what's happening to you all right now could it be that we could think that away too we see sickness come on somebody well it must have been that must mean something done wrong even sometimes when Seaton's comes with us we question was it something we've done wrong that's fine you know that's fine to do that couldn't make ourself right but as far as what's to anyone else that is none of my business you know some houses somebody else you know that's none of my business and that's what preachers will do though they'll use that as a scare tactic to try to get control and they'll say look what's happened to you and look what's going to happen to you well you know after about 40 years driving down the road you probably bound to have a wreck living person come let's see that God's wrath against you well then they've done had 10 in the 40 years that you've been driving but it's never for them yeah me that's why Joe could sit back to his condemn verse said you got a problem you know you having any trouble truck so ever well you uh maybe it's your problem maybe you've done something wrong but he didn't take that approach he just made it stately as I said and this would be the beautiful perfect number two but in this meat jobs answer I've done what God said dude no that's not what Cain said when he said I've offered the offer and you take it or leave it come in penning it was the wrong offering right right that's right and he made the right one they would have been in trouble right God would it took his offering yeah no problem let's see job said I've Alfred it I've done what God told me to do so I have to stand on what God says all right now that's what I'm trying to get you an odyssey that we've actually we've got to come to a place within our sales that's right to were that we can get to the word and just say the word says it and I believe right so I played the Brooklyn I think the thing that Bible say well mine you can get down an argue points about it you know to see but that's still a go change nobody and you know I set in that early yesterday and I took money and the morning wants the entitlement said I m'dear staying with a while I'm just reading it reading The Anointed once the end time and how that was actually the Spirit of God you know on the people but yet that they took their a word that was not God's work and you know and they wound up being what they were and you know if I was said that God would then turn them over to a strong delusion to leave a line be damned well well you know I got to thinking about it they kind of changed my thoughts on something it won't change me preaching against wrong with people but it's changed my thoughts about you making it right because they go off into a room and God has even blessed them yep because that's you know it won't try run see they can happen you don't want no I can't hit me in one night hey me if I'm lost if I'm an antichrist I'm like what brother L said i wanna be the best convey a man i think that's right because i can't help it I'm just what I am so they don't have to stand that roundabout way Lord you know maybe I'll try to get away from things you know because people can't help it but those who want to hear can hear know if you have the baptism with all we go so you will hear all right that's right let you don't you'll have your own idea and you'd be annoying didn't go out and have a good time but you know it's all right but now listen what was we trying to make as a background on to this to probably get to a place to see what Jesus was saying when he said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect when all mankind has either tried to deny that perfection or say you know nobody can be perfect huh are they try to explain that away you know and they'll say well if that incident there a Matthew that it's saying complete a full age and it does that's the definition from the word perfect north in Matthew 5 all right but then I hold on a minute you might find a definition in the Old Testament that's identical for the word perfect and it might be a surprise okay so we just rolled onto the point but what I'm trying to get me in you to see is if God says it now this is all I'm trying to preach all right don't you get this with if everybody get it right now doing this we just quit go home because this is my whole point if God says it run around and said it was a requirement right he said in God required us to be perfect and he said he had to make away and says he has made away all right now I'm trying to go back go to the Old Testament with it to talk about those back there the word that God would call them perfect right see then you come up several but when that weapon no no they can't be they can't be perfect cuz they would mourn again when I agree we they would but let's just go through the scripture think of that he the atonement of the natural animal sure now had to be made it was required and it was done Joe had offered the atonement he even offered the atonement for his children alright then God saved them because of his atonement he lost seven of them but he got seven more back when he got those seven and glory now that's the way run around this mind it alright so now just bear with me see under the natural atonement of an animal God covered their sin alright now you look to the red at red and what do you see alright so if God covered their sin now know it pushed it up reach to the other man it pushed it to Calvary no Jesus Christ had to die for all thin lure line huh but also know that ever atonement that was made was speaking of Christ right that's why you agree each one was so then what he was doing back there the blood of bulls and goats couldn't get into the heart of man to be able to give him eternal life as a new earth but it could cover him in his natural doings until he could stand before God he's in that animal atonement God said to make it in the Dean and then as they made it with an honest and sincere heart I know I told you I don't believe everybody they walked up there with the blood of the Bulls and the goats and you know it's forgiving I don't I just um not that far off I don't believe it the doc you just throw all of them I know it's a nation when they offered the blood of bulls and go you know they need to tone the nation but that was naturally to keep them from being destroyed but if you didn't have faith in your atonement but around said you had to believe these by laying your hands upon that animal that God transmitted your sins to that animal Joe is faith right you know believe in God you wouldn't just well here yeah blame I'm going back do it again no I'm God's not done I don't think he wants us to be that way arnott but you remember what we got in to knit talking about the atonement that Moses there in Exodus 32 he said when the children of Israel had sinned with the golden k he said I thought before God and said pre adventure I shall make an atonement well now go through your Bible to find out where he offered an animal he didn't offer an animal you went before God and play the case and said God if you destroy them destroy me all right let a random puts the two scriptures together to work did he comes out of them saying yo you brought him out you take take them in sand that's what will be sat out here about you but said that's you know and so he reminded God that God had told him that he would take the people to the land that's right he took him up to the promised land he couldn't take them in not because of their but because he over the other much smack a rock all right but still he went to the lane orna now what its home that then was being made was Moses is worth reminding god of his word hey the road said I couldn't understand that until I seen that it was Christ and Moses alright see Christ me how to lead the case right right now they had to make the covering right but the atonement was made to the voice of a man we ended up talking about how that we needed the grace of marriage and divorce and then we've got to believe that God told man the gonna tell us right the way to be free we've got to believe that so then has it been my point was then was this like name was God looking at the atonement her was he were reminded of his word which one was it when I asked you the question I said who took care of Adam and Eve in the time that was between their sin and the time God made the atonement who took care of them the word had already said that he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so God couldn't kill at him and he couldn't guilty right the because that word had already been spoken right now we can believe it that away see then we can see why it's all in the Bible I I'm speaking that God says we're perfect man but we try to figure it out we try to dissect words we try to to get an interpretation then we go into the Bible and we pick up like none of their doing this message we get to this minute but they say no it was perfect that that many was the only seat left then he was perfect he was the only true seed left and they try to preach the seed from that who we will read in a minute that the same definition for Noah that says he was perfect is the same definition that says Satan was perfect he was Creely so we're Satan the only see you know what i said i'll get dr. and the people in vain but i realize they can't have it and that going out that way won't convert one person probably unless it's somebody that's really got an honest and sincere heart then we'll think about hey this man just said something right but most won't all right but now think about it he covered their sin so much in the Old Testament until actually they could stand in the presence of God that's right now that's pretty perfect go once in and the presence of God right around said is automatic death so they're perfect hey why can't we bleed come on now get to it a few minutes if we can believe under the blood of bulls and goats the day was perfect but how much more should it be under the blood of Jesus Christ right what I'm trying to get you see it don't change there's still what God said my mom go you can't prove Jesus crap died you might claim to have a couple of drops of the blood but you can't prove so we're based on what some man say it that God said right right we know what we're only thing we got to do is get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that can divide the difference to whether the man was saying it of his own self presumptuously as the Bible says I was saying what God see that's all I'm trying to get us to see he's gonna be able to say what God said now this this message will go on well now so I would listen to the background please because it other things that will be involved as we go along all right you come out to see the day that we're living what's wrong with most people we said we believe the Bible I said when I was the bad news church i believe the Bible knock up on that I didn't believe now listen I didn't believe what I thought it said you know I mean I believed it didn't say it like it's a at night by understand man he didn't change the wording that's right right did you say saw that it didn't say what I thought it's all right right right right we know it said baptized father-son holding up you said what I said Jack with the letter that's not what to say that's right but then we don't go overboard see if throw it out because once you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are baptized in the father coming home right that's what I say it anyway when i baptize anybody you know to fulfill the Great Commission to baptize and name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because it's the only way to me don't have it but it's getting to the point of believing it amen believing what God's saying amen if we believed it correctly then we would read there in Revelation we went into the 13 8 where the delay i'm stood slain before the foundation of the world right their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life we believe that would not believe it as to the point to make us to work that we it need to be saved that's what I pickle does in this message they they think one always was a Christian always have eternal life well if you always that Jesus died money all right do you wonder why I keep saying something them go there quick to you one day day hey that can't be right all right what I'm trying to get me you to do is to believe if God said make a sacrifice then that sacrifice from a sincere heart would cover that individual so much until that individual should Murphy hi amen complete Alleluia see whether it be older New Testament we gotta believe look what God says is true mm-hmm but what we want is we want a man to say hmm hey right heaven I thought claiming they will accept it right now when I what was the children of Israel when God came down that literally were going to talk to every one of you know how priestly Moses had a burning bush got talk to it when he came out in the burning bush wherever is realized to stand before and glide would have spoke to every one of them what happened Moses you tell God it we can't stand it like this do you go up that can you find out what God wants us to know and will believe you and do everything you say the winning kamag told them the deleted did you do it if they did it was just for comfort Moses said I got to do it drivers go do it you were the same situation or attitude or our condition that Moses walked before God you see they said we lady Moreta says the hardest thing in the world to get one man to believe another yeah that's right right I'm have no problem is quoting him all right if you tell me something that I'll play strip I'm gonna tell blaze drew and I hope you'll do the same thing with me does they don't bleed but their sins were covered so much now you said when I wait a min Rodale they couldn't go behind the veil no because that's the way God ordained it but Aaron's no tell me erin was a sinner and went back there and come out alive come on you better think with me he had the fake blood for yourself first then for the people and they had a rope tied around the old boy just in case if he wasn't right he didn't matter if everybody else was right that's right he done the high priest he could stand before God how long can we preach on how Moses to do he went round before garland 40 days and 40 nights out in food and water come on right after a good long 40 day fast and coming out of our weakness could be he runs into a bunch of people making ago entire night when they give you a good feeling no you upped our asking God what he wants them to know they'd better dykes it around the cave you get what I'm saying the hot breeze could go before God and literally stand in the Holy of Holies there's a wonderful place until he forgot his his walking stick if we call it his rod right one time and went back and found out it bled in Boston wooden barrel almonds there in that presence but what God told Moses was the only thing that kept Aaron alive or any priests that went in there after word got to tell Aaron what to death right you told Moses what to die don't you think that if I gonna be back there brother Colley he would he was Moses and I was Aaron do you think I'd say no Moses are you sure have you forgot anything look me over good examine me ever phase that's good i want to make sure you know what i thought about the other day I thought and I know they ruin then we'll know that but still I thought you know Moses have a photographic memory that's the best answer I come up with you know what a photographic memory is if you can remember everything you've ever heard seen or whatever there's people vacuum to do that all right cuz God tells Moses a whole lot of things to do and he goes then he tells them what to do now we fix that marriage guard with 70 say that again they'll make sure I get around jejejeje usually short means you do because his life was at stake now that's the Christ it was the same one that was back there telling God a better way of doing truck was the same process break of hoses memory exactly what the pen once he got away from that see this thing is not made on this haphazard that's right but it's bleeding man believing that God told that man and then that man told the people that's right you know the whole Bible based on that where I said that about their in Jesus went even is Satan you matthew twenty Matthew 5 you see what I say love your enemies me a man you see what I'm getting that see we might say or think that they were not made perfect by the blood on blood of bulls and goats but God said they were perfect because they were covered by the atonement right now get it right that blood of bulls and goats never gave them the humor come on we know better than that that came on the day of Pentecost they did not have the new birth the Old Testament but when God said they were perfect why can't I say they was perfect right instead of trying to figure out some way there's some kind of something could be let's go over to the jenison you start a little bit good see that's why I want you to think about people of this message preached that Noah was the only righteous see left big names all right only righteous seed that you was left the words coming from Adam the purity look to know what well it's that be right noise laugh the end would have been messed up as Noah's life was messed up all the noise kids would be messed up because they didn't hurt from their mother so what good would it do you try to preach some kind of a perfectly these preacher perfect God would you see their little Chinese people you think they gonna listen to me even though i would say listen in a minute we'll just use the same definition for noise we use it for Satan but you see people listen something like that I is just a smart naked all right a much more than I don't like to be called a deadlier smarts okay all right let's go to Genesis 6 verse 8 why are you getting there but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord these are the generations of no one know was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God and no one the Bible said was perfect so now we've already got somebody in the Old Testament we quoted these last week but I wanted to get like me I want you to think about this time no one was perfect hmm that word perfect is 85 49 Strong's Concordance okay as ninety four times we're perfect using about it means complete it means whole wh 0 le you know whole means entire it means sound let's 0 UND sound it means innocent from know all of us completely with holy the entire you sally was if he's perfect one because he made the atonement right no matter if even got a drop yet how did I do it God said he was perfect drop over to Genesis 17 verse 1 now God said something can be done he's got to provide the way to do it in when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto Him I am The Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect well now if God told him if he would walk before him he'd be perfect will not it evidently the abilities there do you understand the abilities dire to be perfect or he could have said that I've got the same definition now have 85 49 which means complete cold and dark slammed is all right let's go over the job because in the book of job where I want to go let's go over there only let's go to juror chapter one and verse 1 there was a man in the land of us whose name was joke and that man was perfect and upright and one that fear of God in the chute evil so it's his joke was perfect okay verse 8 and the Lord said unto Satan what he thinks a joke I stop considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that it should well that's me regardless she was evil two times he said chapter 2 and verse 3 and the Lord said unto Satan has not considered my servant job the Turk nothing like him in the earth are perfect and another outland one that feareth god and eschewed evil still he hold her fast his integrity although God moveis me against him to destroy him without cold the God is reminding Satan you know to remember the story yes you've got it heads built around Joe take the hitch down let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face he said okay go ahead but he said he still got his integrity all right now that word joke dire remember the other ones 85 49 this is 85 39 x cubed maybe 3,500 run Aleeah 8535 I can't read my own nut right never gets cold so what is the word perfect about job where you mentioned in three times is the word perfect is the word complete it's morally innocent is having integrity one who is morally morally and ethically pure that's what that word meant that's what God was saying about Joe I don't see how the world it could be perfect back he was under the atone he made you don't write as I said a moment ago even made the atonement for his own kids he's no Bible written this gets made in the toilet he made it home for his kids and God said hmm so when you think about how did he get to be that way songs 18-plus that's the psalmist how this happened it's on the 18 and verse 30 p this is just where he got through saying that you run through a troop Lincoln over the long gun and forgot his ways perfect the word of the Lord has tried he has a buffer to all those that trust in him for who is life who is God saved the Lord are who is a rock save our God is God that Goethe thony was strength and maketh my way perfect right maketh my way perfect you know so we see that it's got to be the atonement that made of perfectly right they done what God said knew he said all for the offering they offered the offering and they stood underneath that there was nothing there to take away the desire to see him so in a lot of incidences they would go back and do the same thing right run yeah he finally became under the law the dalal became a record keeper exactly what it became that's right under the law back there with with them you know until it came into existence of the Ten Commandments it would be of your own heart when the law came into existence it started keeping records you better not have a science in and happen again before the next year could never you know God don't play around that's my point it is not something to where you just say what God just accepted the offering mmm these that I'm sick of your offerings they become a snake in my nostrils but an honest and a contrite heart is what I live to see see but when God says you're perfect what are you look at Ezekiel 28 this is talking about Satan company North you know that your verse 14 the cover it and they'll made d so now how I wished upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stone to fire that was perfect in my way from the day that I was created till iniquity was found in thee it even says Satan was perfect yeah but nobody can be perfect well the Bible said Satan with us before you fell wrong right and that's what I've always tried to preach to you guys can't make any time man you can't make anything evil you can't make anything imperfect never creation God ever made is perfect and it's a term perfect you know until an egg with your child is perfect until it reaches the age of accountability is perfect don't you ever think that one but now when the record started being kept by the law would start keeping a record of night then we brought our self out from under the fact of the imperfect but just remember the atonement is what made you perfect now the same word our aunt ezekiel 28 15 is 85 49 which is the same identical word for talking and telling Abraham to walk before him and he'd be perfect and telling Noah that he was perfect till they were perfect he was perfect when he was created because it God cannot create anything that's not perfect all right but my point is that if God says they were perfect then they were perfect well then we ought to be going away look nobody can be perfect you thank you perfect I don't like this one a lot of you did I've heard you like that I learned you say see the bumper sticker said I'm not perfect I'm just revealing no no I can you may rejoice and say glory look at that no no that ain't sensible if you're forgiving your perfect to want to say I'm not perfect I'll just forgive them if I'm forgiving of perfect because it could be no record made of it if i forgiven right I'm not just forgiven I'm perfect if I'm forgiven get it Old Testament then sure it had to cover them but one day Jesus Christ came and died and they could not raise in the resurrection remember until Jesus Christ died remember that a few weeks ago then when Jesus Christ died it proved because they went up it proved we don't have to go through the dribble ison you remember that I just went to profit say it to write my kid we're leaving New we climb these are profit that's what gets me you like said about Moses want to go Moses go get it Helen tell us bread around tell us what to do he tells me something we say I don't like yet yeah I'm like it ain't gonna do it that way why don't we ask him to go fast God about Billy following down now this is what he said 11 says not you make the coin he said daddy told one person for what to do you told another person run officers what to do he said I told him what they wanted to hear what he said I told him what you wanted to hear but know this you say but brother they have ever only covered and they wasn't perfect what God didn't have any trouble using to doing right glad they know any trouble coming down and fellowshipping with the children literal you want to tell him that he was wrong you want to tell you that that high priest could actually walk right into if chief pilot glory and come back out and even the new ones the matter was put in there and the new priest was allowed to go in upon his time of we'd had to go in as a first trip you know he was allowed to take a piece of the original manner that it fallen in the wilderness and you gonna tell me that he's not perfect oh he was just covered with what is covered man that's right red to red you see why I gave you the quote are the other day were upset if I've got a spot on my hand and I like something over he said I just covered it it's still not right but he said if it's eradicated now that's what Jesus done to Calvary I could only be held on the dark the Calvary he made the atonement that eradicated the scene he eradicated the Old Testament sins and well are you and I all sin was pushed to Calvary vile said he died once they mad he for all of us hey man seeing the children of Israel that pillar of fire could hold over them the cloud was over them Moses could talk to you face-to-face he actually seen the back part of God the end of extending the cleft of the rock the same rock he had to smite get the water from the cleft of the rock but he's allowed to see it under the blood of bulls no that's right well of course nobody none of us / you don't think wrong asleep yeah you get to the only person that didn't do something wrong this week as a person that's in a comatose state they can't do it but they can still think if they're able to do that that makes still be wrong we better believe in anatomic that's right we don't need no talk no more weird tunnel it's only for the soul that's right why would we need an advocate with the father if it wasn't for the fact that he knew we were going to do wrong hey man run around do you see and he said after a day you argue your profit and gone about comes now you're going to argue it opens right up with the statement tomorrow stage now whether or not you believe it we're not gonna do us any good that's right then well I don't know if Brett Ratten said I believe it I invite you to go to the message instead and see if what I'm saying dry that's right and if it's not bring it to me man would you see what we want to talk about is these things in this their own to her own benefit her own way of doing what is it enough the most in Hebrew Stephen Ward we like that where the blood of bulls and goats could not make the cover thereunto perfect see that now I'd advise you not to use that scripture room I've said that before and our people's feelings but I'd advise you to not use that scripture run because if you say that scripture says that nobody in the Old Testament perfect then what are you gonna do the scriptures I get you where job was perfect right and we're no more was perfect and all that we preached about the atonement and what it's done well it said that why don't you read it in the language of the Bible why don't you read it to the corner say that like this those sacrifices and offerings could not bring eternal life right to the individual under that time yeah but brother branham never said it better way okay no problem he said in one place Judas went hung himself and in other places they go do likewise so where we going anything you give me the bread round said probably out of memory i can give you a quote from somewhere that seemed almost totally contrary them you give me a scripture and i can give you a scripture that seems totally contrary now you know that's true right but you know that's not true in the basis that that's the way it is it's not that away right man the Bible's ride the prophets right right man then where he had to correct he corrected all right we see where depended upon what a man said we were glad to say that he said about magazine divorce would take that we have one that's raw yeah he's right well what about over here what he said on the Rue Jordan no no no I don't agree with him there well we're weird do we believe God's Word that's the whole of what I got all the way down that's right see if you take scriptures on the new testament to say that that blood of bulls and goats couldn't make you perfect you better take it in the right way because it could not bring you eternal life butcher church like I've always seen if David under the blood of bulls and goats could kill a bear a line on a jonathan and wouldn't afraid of nothing and then we as christians are scared to death then we might get deceived oh my i missin brother but i'm gonna get to say no i've told you before you're all ready to see well let's take what roast oh but you won't tell you what run around says and the Bible says would you take what brother so a joke said you know why is because he says it the way you want it to be saying right hurt people making at to soak starting man said I believe that all of my mind it just now come out the man is preaching what I believed I guess that's true he probably did but you see church the Bible says they were perfect back there then how much more would it be under the blood of jesus christ by the back tears i'm going to hold the ghosts in your song right well you know what we ought to start staying more to sing that song what is it to the loot kid is it right let's see I am perfect I am as a hybrid I am blessed between God made me God made me I am special because we're going to get to a lot of these words and you're going to find out the word justified that's right the word specially to look on a dime the word righteous is going to take us about 20 years to preach this winter we don't start saying I'm perfect vago all right no not perfect i'll just forgiven forgiven is the same word is perfect a man by the man known about them brett said you'll be neatly forgiving but not not justified you know what is nothing that tonight no wonder a man named David could you didn't spirit come on now and he say blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin was that some kind of special genetic seed is everybody wants to make out of know of in the only righteous seat it was left they preach that folks well if he was there is no hope for any of us because everybody from they don't come through know what his kids that means it's kids with high freeze cuz it wasn't perfect you better say no and his wife was perfect then you got jacket but then you fall over on the other side you have noah and his wife being perfect and all their kids being perfect then you find it on the kids wives for not being perfect no whoa boy you've got to generation you got it you got a genealogy you got a great revelation a what when God said to to Satan you was perfect in your creation he was complete you was without integrity you was righteous you was just he was complete that's what he said to say well he really didn't mean that okay talk to God I just don't bleed no I just gonna believe what God's sake right see that's where we look at it we look at the Old Testament as a group of people that you know it's just all just a mess up how degree leave us now look at a bunch of people in the message people is just a bunch messe because the denominational people would never come up with a lot of the ideas and this message and good bad uses preach River Jordan my eyes right and lemon & goo that was you see church i'm trying to get us to say one time if you repent of your sins hello just repeat that's right you name that that could never be broke Michael again finish you that I thank you Father I thought we believed about which they would put in as far as Lisa the West's need forgetfulness right because that's what we believe did the east-west has no boundary north and south does you got hope you just keep going around by the other whatever you can't know how no ponies away so that made my center still going right that's just repentance a justification you repent of your sins God forgives your past amen let's see we don't we keep bringing it up though amen yep at least joe said I have done what he said for me to do what else can I toad that's right well you're just a secret Center well then show me where the sand that bring witnesses that I'm a sinner but even Jesus when he was good there on the ground and rope on that little prostitute see they had done wrong him over the barrel with it they said what does the law say right he should not change that because the word said she was to be stoned right he couldn't turn I forgive her that's what this won't need to do see he couldn't do it Coheed already set their way to be noisy said he got rid of the winds right he just condemned the paper it was wet us again i right you condemn them and they looked at herself considered just like her and they said if we could we go rocket her he don't know what it does you know he had every right to do it he said words your accusers she said not have him he said needed rocking them they go and see them live that's what we don't believe we don't believe that God he's able to forget I told you one of these days I'm gonna get up enough nerve to preach good i don't think i don't like it i moan for each other god without Aneesha i asked him to forgive me of my sins you know what he does he forgives me nobody said he says you're righteous you're just you stand before me complete move cuz i ain't no second i thought there's no saying I'm complete well I just try to live like an elder well you are the devil won't let this out without make my plant growing nicely within this windy I don't believe ever everybody know Desmond took the land up don't it now stood get it for me his sins wouldn't forget us he was just like it was when God told Moses you better go back and read that God told Moses he said you take him in and I won't kill him but he said I will judge them at another time read your Bible he said I'll judge you why because they wasn't covered it's just that man's word tell a bunch of people then turned around and tried their best to kill the main never way they could they tried to destroy Moses and he was only reason they was alive right right and they wanted to kill him they wanted to get rid of you were the only reason and all that was still live right the god said the time comes out judge so when that man throw that laying up there okay go ahead you don't want to see your actions are covered but I'll judge your heart right that's it who's your heart's not right because he said an honest in a contrite heart was what he was looking for he got tired of their offerings and sacrifices that he ordained for them to do what about you the night right but if under the blood of bulls and goats are you getting them one more time is about three times said if that covered them until they were perfect forgiven right why because it pushed it on to Calvary where Jesus paid the price had he not done that and wet the bed forgiven right never sacrifice was looking to Calvary when it come to Calvary he paid the price then they were wiped away and those Old Testament Saints one hood that's right Nolan didn't know what you don't say all of this I think worked as meaning that around I think sending me the Old Testament Saints rogue did it say all level right right one because it would a lot of them we're going to go to the judgment seat and be judged we can either put our send under the bud that's right so we can have to go to a judgment and if we're Christians were even still have a judgment of the deeds done in the body where they're good about it if we won't repent of our sins here we're going to face some dark and you know what we're going to face the people we send with four against or whatever we better get a straight here that's why I have no trouble saying if I've done anything against to you any of you I'm summary ever forgive me that's right I was doing what I thought was right I didn't know justification but it's just what I am amen don't watch the day is coming and to go pick up some meat over to process in place there's on the way back I can't do Maslin you know you you know how you met you were splashing much for the food radish 25 mile an hour but other than that is 35 or something like that you know and I was just coasting on my home now slow down slow down pretty slow watch brother under 35 might have been 38 might

that scripture to show we don't go through the tribulation he used the scripture those Old Testament Saints raised he said that shows we don't go through the tribulation because they raised it proved
