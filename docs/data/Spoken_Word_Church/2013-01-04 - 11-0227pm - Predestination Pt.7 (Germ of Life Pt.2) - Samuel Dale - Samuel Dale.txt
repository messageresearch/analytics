everybody in the house of the Lord if You' like turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading in Ephesians 1 and also we'll read in John 12 try to disc continue the thought on this morning cuz I didn't get to finish all the notes and and the quotes and things so we'll continue that on Amen I uh ran off one back there of what one statement I'd made this morning and I made it just a little incorrect so I figured I better give it to you exactly but brother Brown said on the Statue of perfect man 1962 uh 10:14 the morning service which would be page 58 it's talking about the gold standard to throw her back on the gold standard and you people just keep your homes and things but you belong to the Catholic Church church right see I said you'll take the mark of east or something like that but it said but you belong to the Catholic Church the nation belongs to the Catholic Church the whole thing is captured right in like that through their currency so you know maybe one of these days we'll have to give up our homes that's right that's a you know you say well I don't think that'll be for us well all right that's up to God and really it's up to me and you cuz I preached many many years ago a sermon on persecution now not tribulation I don't believe in it now persecution pre-tribulation and thing and why we we must have it I remember the title remember the sermon see why we must have it you know why CU we won't line up and if we won't line up God's going to line us up so he may make us hungry may make us a lot of things not put us in in the tribulation no way but you say well I don't believe that that's what our God would allow us to do well he did your brothers and sisters does he love you more I guess you think you're special or something he loves you greater but I'm sorry that just won't won't pan out okay but just remember that remember now the Bible study will be uh this coming Saturday at 6:00 and then we will be having the fellowship meeting on the third Saturday to you know for here now in April we will be having on the April the 10th brother Claud W singer will be here preaching that weekend for us and then on the Easter weekend brother Jim Pinkston from uh Tula Oklahoma will be here or wiah Kansas excuse me I get them all out there wiah Kansas will be here preaching for us and we'll be having for certain Saturday and Sunday Services thinking about having Friday service but we'll see what works from that and then we do plan on that weekend we plan on having a Sunday dinner so all the sisters are asked to you know that's Easter weekend Sunday to fix a meal but then on the 4th of July weekend we still haven't decided who's going to preach yet but we will be having another service is like Saturday Sunday uh the fourth is on Monday but that will be our 40 Years of here at the church since July the 4th 1971 and that one we will cater it for you because that will be a an opportunity to to thank you for all of the times and the doing okay so let's pray before we read our scripture father we thank you we love you and we ask you that you would just bless us with your understanding give us of thy Grace and love and may our hearts be set on fire for you and may we see you Lord living among us we love you and we thank you be with each one that is sick these old bodies are wearing out but yet God is not wearing out so it makes you greater and Lord we believe you that by your stripes we're healed we ask you to just guide us and keep us forgive us of our many sins bless those that are not with us because of the sicknesses and things be with Brother Dean there Lord touch him and let everything be all right tomorrow when he goes for the test and you clear out the headaches it's not just to say everything's all right but you clear out the problems Lord because that's what we desire and you said in your word and we've read this morning where your Prophet said then you must keep your word so we F read in your word that by your stripes we're healed we read in your word where that you sent your word and healed us so maybe as we listen even the word itself will come forth as it did there in the scriptures and heal the people that are there we love you and we thank you sanctify us and all of us together in your love in Jesus name amen and amen Ephesians 1 verse3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he ha hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he ha purposed in himself that in what that in the full that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory which first trusted in Christ now let's go over to John 12 verse 23 and 24 you know immediately that this is when they came to Jesus and they said sir we would see Jesus and this was his answer back of the only way you'll ever see Jesus right and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit you can read on the rest of it let you be seated let's just stop there because that's what I want you to get the the point of seeing that he is that corn of wheat and we must be that all right and uh now talking of predestination you I hope you enjoyed this morning try to bring out a few things cuz I just thought of that the other day and I thought well sometimes it's easier to understand something by to use tops and shadows and uh to see things that way so you know that's why I chose to use and it to me it's very f to see that that the children of Israel in the natural they were brother R said in the church a book it was necessary that the people of Israel the children of Israel be there and be their way for the people to stand the Jews to stand and be against Jesus cuz see the predestination of God even your natural life is coming by predestination because that's right uh who or how did you get here yep you know like he said that there's many uh I know people will argue and say there's only one egg but you can argue with brother random all you want to he says there's thousands of eggs and thousands of germs comes down or sperm and he said it's not the first ones that meet said even your natural birth is by predestination said it'll crawl over and connect because that way then uh you know all of it is uh gathering in what he desires but see the children of Israel natural Seed of Abraham you know they as I said they showed their colors right because they would not swap with the word all right so then the spiritual seed showed their Colors by staying with the word like Joshua and Caleb and you know uh Isaac staying with it AB Abraham being with the word you and you come to find out then that they were the they were the Christ are the seed was there in them and I believe as I said this morning I believe that those people come with a seed within them yes all right and uh you know I believe that's the point that that we need to look at I believe everybody can with an opportunity one form or the other to be able to serve God right whether you Worship in totem poles in Africa or at the North Pole with the Indians and them worshiping things you know still there's a connection there to God because God created us right all right then we want to worship him you know then we pervert that and turn it away I don't believe Judas this carot was any different baby than anybody else he wasn't a mean little devil all the time you know no he he wasn't that Adolf Hitler he was a probably a good little baby and all like that and probably tried in his life to be decent you know but then he turned and you know you know and was against the Jews and brother BR said that you know he didn't understand because he was a half Jew see and you know but he the story goes with Hitler that see he he wanted the Jews to raise up and fight and he figured they would but they wouldn't do it so that turned him hatefully against them right and you know he began to kill them all over because that they wouldn't even raise up and fight right but they could not do that because they were under that period of time that they had to be drove back to the Homeland right and had they took their money which they owned Germany basically the the Jews did if you know your history you know they were the money people they were the money people in every country that they've ever been in and they could have took that money and CA uh insurrections and all kind of things but it wasn't a time so God held back from them doing that and and allowed Hitler to come forth and them to drive them back to the Homeland all right but now see there's a natural people all right then there is a spiritual Seed of Abraham that was in the Old Testament did you follow that all right then when we come into the New Testament down through the church ages then we come forth to see that they would also be a religious system of the churches and the things that would form organizations after every man you know went forth with his message like the prophet said a message in Elish about 3 and 1/2 years and then they would begin to organize or or denominate that message you know and things and by doing that then we see that at the same time there was a spiritual group of people that's right which was the Christ that would come forth to follow the word and you have them in every age see that they came down you know maybe it got small amount you know but then it it it was still no matter if you just had one person that would be enough for God to display his seed upon the Earth so right I believe people came with a seed in them I believe the Old Testament people had a seed in them in those that were the Christ of the time you know not everybody now but in the Christ of the time and it was planted there because of for knowledge of God that he knew who would you know do what they would do and and line up but I believe it goes back further than that into the very mind of God to where that God would have a family as I saying Wednesday night right see this didn't have Hazard happened to where he says well I'll just throw the people out and you know whatever they go and if some of them's pretty good I'll just pick me out a few now I don't believe God done that amen I believe he had in his mind his attributes his thoughts right and we were there in his mind we'll get to that more later I've got it in the next message but I won't be able to get to it this evening but we had to be there in his mind or we'll never be there you know you're not pulling nothing over on God you're not going to get saved is a bad just said we won't have revivals because that way somebody might get saved that wasn't meant to be saved you know and that's pretty well the people of the message if I believe what the people of the message I'm talking about a big portion of the people of the message if I believe it that way I just quit and go home right I just go home forget it I wouldn't do nothing El why call I'm predestinated yeah I have eternal life yeah no matter what I do I'm going to heaven that's you know people get hate I mean get mad at you because you expose those things right but just remember I wasn't the one that come up with the doctrine you know right Paul said have I become your enemy because I tell you the truth you know he didn't want to tell it did he but he become an enemy to him okay so then we see as we've got right at the end of it talking about how that each age had a predestinated seed right all right now that was the word that was predestinated eternally right right now in talking about that we're still on The Germ of life cuz we didn't get to finish it but that seed had to be predestinated the prophet said 154 Church age book the seed or word come predestinated eternally from God all right see we look at it as being and it's fine to hold us until we get to the truth but we look it at as just well the seed is just you know here's mankind here's the world and God just goes and the seeds just fall you know and every who that fell on just happened to be you know well if he knew every that and every time it would bad it eye all of that I I don't think that's exactly the way it is you know and but see you're saying well well if you go anything further than for knowledge then you know you're making God a respector no I'm not right if he deals with everybody on Earth by for knowledge he's dealing with me and you by for knowledge he knows exactly what we'll do it's all dealt on for knowledge and he knew that before the world right but then his children are you going to tell him that he done wrong now I'm going to ask you that question over and over are you going to tell him that he done wrong by doing the way he done if you believe that they was happen to be a children of God well then I'm going to ask you where did the foolish virgin come in at where did all of those things and what about those people that's going to be given eternal life one day if you think he ain't a God of love and and cuz brother rown said it even who was it that was it Isaiah was supposed to come through which one of them was it supposed to come through the wound of of Eve right but said she didn't come I mean he didn't come that way and said but everybody he had to come right amen right why cuz he was a predestinated seed right see we you you and I the true seed of God right here today all of you know that are true seeds that are are born again Believers we should have come without this fall right but we didn't you know we should have come that way but we didn't we would have come through the wound of Eve right you say well how would that be done see then you can argue there you get tied up with that and you make a Doctrine out of it well it didn't matter how just let God let it be the way God would have done it but you say well it wasn't going to be that way I know it wasn't going to be that way right because in God at the same time he had a Healer and a savior and all of those attributes and he was going to see him displayed right so he allowed us to come down forgive me for blowing my nose but I'm sorry if it keeps running down you'd see more than you'd want me to blow it but all right but now listen get down to the seriousness of it can you see what I'm talking about now that see then each age would have a predestined ated word right right right all right amen just as each time in the Old Testament there was somebody stood out right I mean each writings it was always somebody stood out in a a a a way to uh you know to show that they were the seed of God back there but we found then that the problem was that they didn't have the Holy Ghost back there to be able to give that seed life so David would go right back even after he'd say I have hid Thy word in my heart that I might not sin against thee turn right back around and go back out and sin right because he had nothing to take those things away from him there was no ability he could be anointed yes but anointings is can be upon anointed ones huh but down inside the soul is where the life is that that's right all right so that's what David said in my soul in my heart not his stumping gizzard right see his heart his soul his being he longed for God and God looked down and saw that and he said he's a man after my own heart amen you mean a murderer adulterous all kind of things right but he said he's a man I my own heart you know he's the apple of my eye you he loved David didn't he you know why cuz David loved him they had a lot to do with it see for knowledge gets involved in a lot of things all right but now get to the point see see then coming into the New Testament you had the ability of the new birth coming and giving eternal life to that seed that's right all right which would not be in the old Testament see it wouldn't the ability back there to bring the seed to life they needed the rain but couldn't have it all right now brother brand let see spoke the word Original Seed he said there was 120 Little Seeds laying in the upper room waiting on the rain to fall right you know all right see then you know without that as most people would say all we got to do just believe it we just take it by faith well you remember brother Bram emphasized that one of the disciples said we've been up here 78 days or how many days you know so let's just take it by faith in other words we already cast already cast out Devils heal the sick and all the thing and they thought they' just go right back and take that ministry right back up you know but it wouldn't work so they had to stay until the Holy Ghost came right all right but as I said this morning now then you got the people in the New Testament that to show just like the natural Israel was shown the people in the New Testament see claimed to be the children of of God right there's not a denomination there's not any kind of a thing that doesn't claim to be a child of God even Buddhist and Hindus Muslim whatever they all claim to be the children of God see and and in that but yet we see then down to that ages that there was a predestinated seed or word amen all right predestinated word to come forth for each age all right that was where we kind of left off at and I was giving you those quotes where brother around was talking about on the uh Church age Books San Church age 284 number three on your notes that's where we'll be starting from he talking about names being blotted out and all the different things and he said that great Royal seat they had to be we had to be chosen in him before the foundation of the world now why was we chosen to be chosen now I didn't bring this out but I want to Brak some message M on that if I can get back to it you think I'm dragging out a lot of things and I think I'm dragging out a lot of things then come find out I ain't dragging enough you and slowing down enough but see chosen in him means exactly what it is when he was chosen we chosen right that's that's simple isn't it to be chosen in him you know if I'd have been chosen in brother colie that means I had to be in brother collie right amen this is not choosing up sides on the ball team try to get the best players right no this is this is the word of God see and if we were chosen in him that means we had to be in him that's right then you say what brother Dale and I know I got it the message we wasn't Spirits we was nothing back there we was in his mind that's right but go back in there far enough to find out that he was a time when he was self-existing right all right now that self-existing is a very deceiving thought because most of our thoughts of self-existing means he existed totally alone you say well that's exactly right but if you wouldn't there in him that's right you never will be that's right amen so was there ever a time that he was our word our word self-existing well brother random you said amen how you going to do it got to get it down to us but there was there ever a time that he didn't have his attributes was there ever a time that he didn't have eternal life right you have eternal life today then that eternal life that you have had to be in him there is no two Eternal lives and all like that so then we have to be a part of him I don't think I think that's just he was the evening message I get so slow all right but he says on proving his word number four when you noce it he by for knowledge predestinated a seed for every age that would believe it you said well that's just for knowledge right but that's not just for knowledge it's for knowledge that he knew that where the seed would fall right because that's my emphasis was that if for knowledge is first all right if forn knowledge comes before predestination then forn knowledge would mean that there was somebody that had to have full knowledge we'll get to where the sons of God shouted for joy and all of that when we get to it we preached on it before but we'll bring it out you know if we get time if we don't we'll meet in the in the Rapture and we don't have to worry about it but we'll sure have a good something good to talk about amen you know see proving his word then paragraph 122 he goes on to say that he knows that seed will be there just at that time he said he predestinated a bride now the bride is not just predestinated by for knowledge the life we live upon this Earth where we're here is predestinated by for knowledge but you back up into eternity and you can go far enough back to be able to see what redeem means right right so you know we're going somewhere right but we got to get it in the right order all right so we've got down to this one this Rising the sun number six 65418 he said Don't Fear anymore forever ordained excuse me ever foreordained predestinated seed of God shall come to life when that light spreads across the Earth of the Glorious gospel he said it was in every age it'll bring forth the crop that God ordains it to do all right now so that's why we read in number three of your notes up there it talks about him being the Royal seed how that he was planted and see this New Testament Church is not me and you it's Jesus Christ in me and you but the seat of Christ is not just me and you it's not just me and you anointed see Christ anointed no it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's not anointing in you hope of glory see that doesn't mean that you say well Christ means the anointing well that's right it's a person that's anointed all right but it's Christ in you the hope of glory all right so then when we come down to it what are we looking at we're looking at what he said here on 152 of the church age book number seven on your notes he's talking about the thoughts of God and then how here we are coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God that was manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that Eternal one was the father manifest in flesh right all right now and thereby gain the title of son that's what made him was that he was in flesh upon the Earth with us and would be called a son right see now watch even so we are you listening Eternal in his thoughts in our term became the many membered spoken word SE right now what does it say in Psalms 139 is that what it is in continuance was my members fashion when is not yet perfect the in continuance one after the other was my members fashioned all right so now looking at it see Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God because his eternal thoughts coming into flesh made him a Son of God right the father manifest in flesh right they we're not children of Jesus that was a child of God that's right we're children of God were Sons and Daughters of God not Sons and Daughters of Jesus that was a Son of God that's right he hold it in a straight line then what he say even as we are soall we did not become seed by the rebirth and here's where everybody goes to with that quote see we always was and then they'll take quotes from brother brandham and all like that and what he said's right but I believe it needs to be put together in the right order or we'll get the wrong idea watch what he says now we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and there were reborn for only the elect can be reborn right no so then we did not become seed we came here with a seed in us right just as Abraham was the seed just as Isaac was a seed what were they they were the word for the hour they were living upon the Earth amen right is that not true with you and I yes now that seed is not that he's asked a question see is the New Birth the birth of the word you come here with or is it what you heard now it's got to be what you heard or else you're going to eliminate the ministry which you eliminate the prophet and you just go back to what I said this morning and just hey let's just have a good time CU we all going to heaven anyway now that's not scriptural that's right see all right but you see then what was it we did not become seed you had to have that seed before you could come to the word that's right amen but not a seed like a spot or a word down inside of you the last quote you have is whatever the little woman at the well she had representation from predestination she had representation of predestination all right by predestination God knew where the seed would land but he did have a seed and as I said he didn't just cast it out all over the world and well now everywhere of that land all just well that would make him choose him no but he had a plan and a purpose go to Christ and M your God reveal and he was going to see it achieve the prophet said right well that's that's that's exactly what them other brothers talking about seeds well did they approach it by for knowledge can they tie four knowledge in with it right just asking you a question to get you to see what we're talking about because the next part is what I like because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonone seed there is nothing to Quicken that's right all right now what makes a natural seed be able to be quickened or you plant it it comes up it has to have the germ of life right all right now is that germ of life eternal no right no it's not right it can be destroyed if it would be possible I know you're going to say it's impossible but if it could be possible then uh well let me put it this way it was impossible in the Old Testament for them to have eternal life right cuz Jesus had not died yet all right so they had deceived but what was different about them they were the word for their day they received the word we'll get to it in a minute it's not just I'm a Christian right that's what people thinks it's just say well I'm a Christian well everybody in the world today Christians like Steven Wilson says ain't nobody going to hell they going to have to do away with it cuz everybody's going to heaven you know it might be because you PID the parking lot or something but you know or put a Pew in a church with your name on the side but you know it might be something like that but everybody's going to heaven well I don't agree with that exactly do you cuz we're going to get something on the next but now what is nonseed nonseed is a seed without the germ of life right right right as I said the prophet talked about them making a grain of corn that they could take it down and they can make corn flakes they could make cornbread out of it they could do everything you know all right and in doing that it looked exactly like but there only one problem it didn't have the germ of life now can you see the germ of life in a seat actually let me ask you SK even more I I don't know about this but I'm going to ask you the question can science find The Germ of life I I really don't know have can they can they go back in there with highed microscopes and go far enough to be able to find some germ of life I don't really know if they can it's all right if they can't it's all right my point is you can't see the germ of Life all right so then quit looking around at people you know to condemn them cuz they might have the germ of life and you might not have it all right good point okay but you see in nonseed now see we want to say nonseed is serpent seed now what happened with Judas right didn't Judas take the word of God y didn't he walk with the word of God didn't he have part of the Ministry Jesus never said you're N Seed what about Judas I serpent seed well then why did Jesus choose him to walk with him and allow him to walk close to him the Rich Young Ruler was he serpent seed when the Bible said Jesus loved him cuz he knew what he said was right he knew he had kept all those Commandments from his youth but see what is none seed wouldn't it be then that the natural Seed of Abraham I'm not talking about Isaac now hold point the natural Seed of Abraham the natural Israelite would be showing you the nonseed situation but Isaac would be showing you the germ of Life Jacob and Esau see Esau would be showing you the germ of life right see whereas Esau would not be having the germ of life cuz Esau was a whole lot better man than Jacob right but see it couldn't be dealt upon that because we read this morning we're talking about where that Jacob had the seed yep right Jac Jacob was a seed what seed the seed of Christ all right so now where are we here the only thing you could have from God would be the germ of life now when you get down to it and you're studying what brother brandom says and we will get those quotes he talks about he said you had a gene of eternal life now I'm not no scientist but I have read a little bit and you know I can make wrong statements but scientist doctors be sitting here they' know it's right see it's not a germ it's a gene Gene comes before a germ I know it can be translated back it and forth okay all right but basically you're a gene and then it comes out to be a germ see and that's the only way that a baby can be born see because you were a gene in your mother and father you know especially in your father but then one day through the bedding ground of wedlock it transferred from a gene into a germ and a germ into a sperm and that would bring forth the child see because of the connection of all right now said it ain't no doctor but I think that's right so then we were seed and could be reborn right see we were in God's mind before the world Amen right or we'll never be right and he said if you wasn't part of that word now I'm not giving these quotes I'll give them later sometimes when need them but if you need them man you're in bad shape as much as I preached around here about it most of you already to know probably the paragraphic comes from in the books you know but you see the word is not Eternal because you have it right now come on you have the new birth right amen am the new birth is the quickening of the word right that's right but do you know everything do you know every word no no then there's something wrong there ain't it right well I know everything the Holy Ghost didn't me knows everything does it I'm asking you a question brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is sitting in your soul waiting on you to bring him the word and he said when it's brought in it'll be quickened that's his way of saying it so you know don't get off on your big Ideas you know just be sensible see just take what he's saying if you were not seed you could never be reborn right right if you was not a part of God before the world you will never be a part of God right okay sensible so let's go on look at number eight which is this is from Christ the my God revealed look at which is PID 50 there's only way you'll know him today only way you'll get that three-fold revelation of God is for the Holy Ghost and the only way it can ever be is you're predestinated to see it right now uh hold that for a little because see every age is not predestinated to the same place right I don't want to choose to get on that much because we'll be on to adoption of eventually cuz this age is predestinated unto a full adoption amen right all right but every age before us was not predestinated for a full adoption so thereby the word of the other ages couldn't bring you to adoption that's right full adoption am it couldn't do it it didn't bring them The Headstone hadn't come yet to Prophet said so then hold off on that but see just keep it and remember what he's saying is you're predestinated to see it all right if you don't you'll never see it that's right if you're not predestinated to see it you'll never see it cuz that light can Flash and you'll go away and make fun of it and explain it away by some intellectual conception when the very God himself manifesting himself and proving it see but if it ain't upon you to see it you won't see it right now that's getting down to some predestination now see right cuz if it ain't preached to you how can you see it all right keep on reading God never said never just said I'll choose this one choose that one but he knew by his reason he could predestinate is because he's infinite and he he knows he's infinite so therefore he knowed everything he knowed the end he could tell the end from the beginning he's God if he can't do that he's not God that's it he's infinite all right now this is a continuation of reading right in Christ of mystery right John would have never known him no sir had the Holy Ghost not pointed out see how God hides his mystery to the highend educated in and everything look every one of them people saying and simplicity reveals it to whom he has predestinated to see it look at here others standing by and never see the dove sure they never heard no voice but it was only sent to the predestinated seed predestinated certainly he was predestinated for Isaiah um 712 years before he was born talking about John and the spirit raised up out of these human senses and said there's a voice one crying in the wilderness predestinated that Li Prophet to the ceiling of all the prophets of the Old Testament now everybody's not predestinated to see it that's right that's right that's why everybody in this message is not predestinated to come to the same place because it's the body of Christ there's no argument about who's predestinated to what it's just knowing that's truth so if you're not predestinated God is not obligated to lay the word in front of you where you could attain them to it that's why brother Dale don't throw off on people like they throw off on him see when I say something that old brother D he just gone he serpent se but see I I like to think everybody's got a place you know that's right that's place for them and they'll be what they're supposed to be I've never de christianized nobody I just leave it to that point we will show what we are all right see then that was would be no trouble but see there's a an age and a time look what he says now he cares do you care 1963 7:21 now he did that to the elect now we know that he did that to the elect only to the elect now they was the ones who had accepted this germ of life they were the ones who were predestinated to see it because why they could receive a germ of Life all right do we have the germ of Life we've heard the word right but have we made it a germ of life what if we made it right trying to find some scriptures anyhow what about the difference in Judas and Peter what was the difference one of them had the germ of Life the other one didn't what was the difference I'm trying to look down through but we might as well go ahead and read all the notes I got written up to there and we'll get to a point then we'll go over to to acts and take up our thought number 10 on your notes believ in God 1952 to 24 but plant of wheat he's talking about to take a handful of wheat laying down in my hand and lay it on this desk it would never be nothing but wheat laying there you say I've got the wheat I've got what about the life on it see but plant that wheat in the ground and it'll produce maybe a bushel of wheat you know one little grain that's what he's talking about see but the germ of life is in the wheat but the wheat has to fall into the ground and die Jesus said or Pauls I believe that except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone M and then this is God his word now what's God the word the whe right and when the word anchors down in the heart oh if I could get you to see it when that word anchors D it'll produce what I said y it'll do just you know it's God it has to all right let's go over now to Acts 8 it be a little ahead because all I want to do is read the scripture and get back to it go over to acts 8 and let's read it everybody knows when we get there you see what it is the Ethiopian unic go to verse 28 the Ethiopian unic all right verse 28 all right said he was returning and sitting in his Chariot read Isaiah the prophet now this is what the guy was doing he was sitting in his chur and he he read to Isaiah the prophet then the spirit said unto Phillip go near and join th to his CH this charot and Philip ran hither to him and heard him read the prophet isus and said understandest thou what thou readest now look at it he'd been up there to worship he'd been up there he knew the scriptures he was reading the scriptures see but yet look what he said and he said how can I understand except some man should guide me and he desired philli that he would come up and sit with him it gets into the scriptures with him now so you see what the Prophet is saying over here that we just read see it anchors down in there when you hear it you said what what it was always down in there was it always something down in there you know like a spot or was it a word that the man was able to comprehend look at the next one number 11 on your notes is your life worthy of the Gospel 63 6:30 the evening let's compare something one time of a life worthy let's compare the life of St Paul to the Rich Young Ruler now you know who the Rich Young Ruler was and what he was and Jesus loved him and all the same light struck both men now that's what your Prophet you argue with him now the same light struck both men both had the same invitation from Jesus Christ is that right they both was well trained in the scriptures they were both theologians remember Jesus told told the Rich Young Ruler keep the Commandments said I've done this from my youth he was a trained man so was St Paul both were well trained in the scriptures but both of them had the word okay one had it from a knowledge the other one had the germ of life in it no when that light flashed across it front of front of Paul he said who Lord who are you right Paul had the germ of Life remember the other night we were bringing it out that the germ can only well I've got it down the next I'm going down spoken words Original Seed 62 318 cuz he talking about the unic and Philip had been up to Pentecost Jerusalem to worship how many says Amen to that the unic he had been with all the DDS and LDS and everything but why didn't he get something he come back down studying the Prophecies of Isaiah although an angel directed philli to him but the germ of Life had to come through the body Philip oh brother now we're on the line where did The Germ come from through the angel angel couldn't do it the angel couldn't remember Gabriel delivered the message to Mary but it took the Holy Ghost to plant the seed Angel couldn't do it right the angel showed him where to go an angel is a messenger here's a son Philip had the germ the message the word that's how a child can be born what from the word the message Philip laid his hands upon Him Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ they come up out of the water sure now The Germ had to come from the body what body Christ body correct and Philip was a member of the body all right now the Ethiopian unit he had the word but he had it by head knowledge Paul had it by germ you said when they both studied the word see I've always defended Paul on one thing and I've still never got a definite answer from anybody I've heard a lot of lot of definitions of where that Paul said you know he he was talking about the it's hard for thee to kick God did that Paul and said it's hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and see I've asked people about that and they give me the natural definitions because I know that I used to plow the mules and they put you know spikes back there we didn't have to do that but they kick the the double trees and single trees and it hurt their feet but in the them days they just put a spikes back there well that's everybody gives that answer that's good that's all right I'm not throwing off on nobody now I'm not saying nothing I'm just saying that it still hasn't given me the full concept of what God was saying to Paul Paul was a good man I believe that you call him a hook noosed Jew I agree with you but yet he was a good man I believe he was and see I believe God was saying to him Paul why are you doing these things you're doing you've heard about Christianity Paul had heard of it because he was out there killing them for what they believed he said you've killed a lot of these people and you've seen them people take death instead of turning against right God sure you cause some to blaspheme by rejecting it I said Paul it's hard for you to kick against the truth cuz the truth is you know what's going on you know them people wouldn't give their life for the gospel you remember who was it the stone Steven and Paul was holding his coat and brother R said that never did leave Paul right even after he become a Christian and went on to his own to death he wanted to die right that's what run said he said that never left him when he seen a man laying on the ground and him throwing stones on him and he's looked up and he said father forgive him Paul might not have been there when Jesus was crucified to hear those words but surely he heard them from a lot of people that told him it's hard for you Paul to go against these things it's hard for you to turn down the truth and see that was The Germ that was in in Paul not because of the letter of the word that he had had planted because the Ethiopian unit had it now the Ethiopian unit went on anded it proving he had it but the Rich Young Ruler had it and proved it wasn't so the Rich Young Ruler had it by head knowledge all Paul had it by The Germ of Life can't you think of after becoming a Christian you know and to go back through your life and remember the things of life that's right I told you I wasn't a Christian I mean I was a nominal Christian okay I believe I come to sanctification I believe that but I wasn't a born again Christian until after come in this message about 2 years after being in the message before I receive the new birth but yet at 11 years old I saw God standing in a church not as a human being form and all but just the knowledge of where he was and from that day on I wanted to find what that was and I talked to people about it and they tell me say you need to go to a Pentecostal church cuz they you know that was more in the realm and uh just telling myself you know my story that you've heard thousands of times already but what would be the germ of life and then when I began to read the Bible after joining the Baptist Church in 58 my wife was a Christian I wasn't and uh I joined the Baptist Church and I told her I said well I guess I need to read the Bible I began to read it and I read all of that and so and so we got so and so and so and so got so and so so and so and so we got so and so I read every bit of that so and so because I realized it could be and I found a lot of things right in the middle of so and so we got so and so I'd find a good key key verse you know that would really emphasize it so don't get tired of reading the Bible when you get into that but see in the Baptist you had to get that gold star from being able to say you'd read the Bible Well if I left out so and so we got sh and so I wouldn't have read the whole Bible all right but see I as going through then I come to Malachi 3 and I come to Malachi 4 and you've heard this over and over so it's not a new thing and I told my wife I said the way I see it before the end of the world comes there's going to be two prophets come cuz I can see that's what the scripture said so when brother Mo began to talk to me about a prophet in the end time I said we in the Bible he said Malachi 4 and he could qu it to me now I I said well okay who's this guy over here in Malachi 3 he said well that was John the Baptist and then he took it Luke 11:17 he took it right through the scriptures and he just fixed it up there and there it was see well now see that scripture is more important to me than any scripture in the Bible right don't you have certain scriptures that are more valuable more more closely related to you right that one is to me you know maybe it you must be born again maybe something you know but that was I think Wade what is it Genesis 26 and 27 is Wade scripture all right see maybe that has something to do with us personally right that God knew that and that would be your foration you say well then is it a scripture laying there no it wasn't a scripture laying there I had to read it I had to read the Bible you have to read the Bible before it can be in you you're not something that brother randam wasn't that God just whacked off his head and closed it up and he had all the word no he studied it amen he was even wrong and would take correction from the word of God uhuh right see but what was that word see some little spark of life right some little something that relates you to Jesus Christ am you can't remember the things see so this Ethiopian unic he couldn't get it himself that's right so he needed somebody to teach him I didn't write in the Bible that the 5old Ministries for the perfecting of the Saints right I didn't write that and I didn't write in there where Paul said in the Corinthians letter that how can we hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sin I didn't write them scriptures right but I do believe them you know I believe it's true you say well well brother Dale you do away with me no I I encourage I beg I plead with you to read and study the message the Bible and the things don't just depend upon me bringing it to you cuz you know read it and study it I encourage that I'm not like the man told Brother Mo said you let them people have the books and they'll know as much as you do well I want you to know much as I do that's what I want you to know it's as much as I do and then more than I do where you can help me you know I want you to do that but see that that unic then once Phillip expounded upon what he was reading is this man speaking of himself or is he speaking of another see yeah and once he expounds upon those things then the unic receiv received water baptism and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and went down to Ethiopia and converted that whole part of the country there from that and that's what a lot of people don't like cuz this thing ain't natural in the Ethiopian unit was a unic right but it don't make no difference he was in the body of Christ and could carry the seed so there not that kind well bless God he can't carry the seed like a brother told me one time about brother he said he can't preach he ain't married you got to be mad to preach I said well Jesus missed it I guess I know that's right sorry sarcastic you know I can't help it if it's laying there brother said I told you he'd bring you a quote for it but I can't help it if I studied the message for 40 something years and if you studied one message 40 something years you ought to know a few answers you know you don't hear that anymore but boy back in the in the late 60s and early' 70s what was it beware of them that have all the answers intellectualism well I cond to phrase you know beware of them that don't have any answers cuz if you got a lot of answers at least some of them can be right you got no answers you have nothing that's sensible but now think about it what was it that they had let's read this one number 13 on your notes things that are to be 65 1205 he's talking about the word as you're looking Looking Glass and coming down and he saying and make that an altar cu the altar is sitting full of people and make that an altar another words your own self don't worry about it there in the chair where you're sitting make that heart of yours heart of theirs the altar he's praying about it see May the world move off from ever brother sister in here and may that little germ of life that Gene of God that we just talked about that attribute that come down from God and has been manifested here to honor and glorify God God moved the world from them may that little germ Jean that we talked about that attribute see when brother brandom will say you always was eternal and check what he's saying he said the eternal life to that you have cuz you have eternal life you always was eternal that's sensible there was a day I didn't have eternal life and there was a day I did what gets me as the people of the message on the other part of it that I've actually heard them preach great messages and things I'm not throwing off but I've heard him preach that then I've heard him preach that Jesus didn't even have eternal life he had to receive it on the River Jordan well that me he was no part of God that's right that's s let need a big light bu turned on he wouldn't no part of God if he didn't have God's own life at his birth am then the Bible said he's born Lord to Christ but now let's take just the two quotes that I've quoted a lot the future home 1964 802 and let's talk about the little woman there that Jesus was talking to he talking about how that the well you say well look at this priest wasn't he a Son of God it proved he wasn't he couldn't recognize what now what he couldn't recognize what did he say I believe the Bible sure but he couldn't recognize the expressed word of the hour right he only had an intellectual learning from some group that been back before him and it's the same thing today see I know that strong but it's the truth there was a word that's spoken exactly for the day for that day and yet and he yet he was a scholar yet he was a renowned person but he could not recognize it why no matter how scholarly he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination now what is predestination d Desy determined beforehand in other words he wasn't a part of God okay that sense will not to say right and you can only do it because look it proves predestination cuz if you got eternal life you had to be a part of God all times cuz he's the only one that's Eternal if you have eternal life you had to be a part of God right so the little woman there she was part of God what living in a garbage can out in the world and going wrong but she had predestination she had representation that's right now if you read all of up and down on that you'll find brother ROM telling you that that priest didn't have representation that's right he wasn't back there in God but yet he was a renowned known scholar had the word to the letter huh sure the only thing he missed was the word made alive right rest of it he understood now look at the next one proving his word 1964 816 that was 802 64 the future home you read all the way down CU you know what it says and was it Jerusalem the Jews and things why he said you've told the truth because you've had five and the one you now have is not your husband see watch something happened see something took life now if it hadn't been if it hadn't have been in there to begin with it she hadn't have had representation from predestination it take it never took hold see she had the germ of life and what is the germ of life okay we'll get to it on the next message cuz I'm trying to get that scripture in my mind I know it's I got in the next message but we'll get to it more of studying of how that people would come to things and how come that you you would come to something and the the person next to you not receive it right and how come it is especially in this message that you even find now that preachers are just falling by the wayside that have followed this message for 30 40 years preach this message and now they're falling by the wayside what about the people that you know and remember that's been in the message since you were in the message and where are they today brother Ray has a good memory talk to him sometime about a lot of the people that he and I used to know that you love them that you just you know you think that they would never in no way some of the people not talking about brother mol and them now but some of the people that actually were were instrumental into bringing us into the message are no longer in the message the ones that were there when we were at our beginning that were really on fire see that just rejected everything seemingly to be able to try in some way help you you know right went to Jeffersonville rode at that time you know he'll tell you listen to brother random people that rode from Georgia all the way to Jeffersonville just for a meeting you know and right on up Beyond Way Beyond go to other meetings and things like that you know but where are they today would it be that they never had the germ of life now what is the germ of Life brother Dale to me the germ of life is the fact that eternal life why we don't believe in Eternal sunship I can come back into the message where it was before on this we don't believe in Eternal sunship right Jesus was an was not an eternal Son of God cuz you can't have a son of God Eternal now you can have God I read you either this morning or this evening one manifested as a son and that can be Eternal right all right right God manifested as a son can be Eternal but you don't have eternal sunship right so God manifested In You by the new birth is eternal life and that's not a son of Jesus that was a Son of God so who are you sure we call ourselves we are the children of God we are the sons and daughters of God Amen that's all right but really the correct way is to say I'm God made manifest in another form called a son because we're his offspring that's what Paul said there I was trying to think of a minute ago to them on Mars Hill he said this unknown God you guys have got to place up here far I'd like to tell you about it and said you even your poets say that we are The Offspring of God we are the children of God what is the germ of life that God before the world not just had you in his mind as to come down because had Judas in his mind right but back up in his mind I told you before I don't want to necessarily be in the mind of God cuz I could be a Judas I want to be the mind of God displayed upon Earth I want to be eternal life displayed and I want you to have it cuz like I've always said it's the only thing that I really want to give away right and I don't want to do it you know what I'm saying but eternal life is the one thing that I've tried to my best to give away cuz I do it every day in the services and things trying to express it to you to see about the God that I'm talking about right amen cuz I believe then that the germ has to come through the body amen well that don't look like you put nothing in there you just missed the whole thing then when brother Brown says you always was eternal I have no problem right if I could take that bench right there and give it eternal life that's what we're thinking it's just something give you know we can just just goe just give it to it just give it eternal life you know no that's totally impossible because to be Eternal means you got to be a part of God now you may think you've trapped me okay let's see if you have I don't mean here necessarily cuz it's going out everywhere what about the foolish virgin they'll be given eternal life won't they that's right they don't have eternal life but it ain't like that bench no right God's for knowledge knew exactly where that foolish virgin would land and if anybody is ever given eternal life that eternal life they're given is a part of the life of God all right that's a part of the life of God the problem is it just like Israel they didn't receive their Earth here they rejected sunship right right they turned it down so we could receive it but one day when we're finished up then they'll receive it and they'll be made Eternal that's all in God's plan but the germ of God is not some kind of a something that you know and I know I know what brother Brown said said the soul maybe the inch square compartment in your heart is the Abode of the Soul you know that science is technology and him expressing it as to a point that that's you know that's what they think about it and he says could it be could it be the abod of the Soul now do you think your soul then is just one little thing little inch our compartment no we'll get to it eventually your soul is your being that's what you are that's right and it's not just an anointing of a spirit right you are a person and God is a person then brother Brandon says it he said by the new birth you and God become together as persons now he didn't mind saying that well what do we have the life of God what is the germ of God then brother Dale the representation from the predestination of God Amen that would allow him to look all the way down yes and see who would be what that's all right that's good that's for knowledge but the germ of life is that part of you that can come alive thank God for it that's right amen thank God for the ability to do it and don't worry about it if you don't have the germ of life you will never be born again right but if you desire to be born again then you got a good hope so then if you D up and say well God predestinated so it don't matter I just be what I am well I've always told you I love God if he wanted me to be an antichrist I want to be a good one right right cuz I love him do you love him that way do you love him to be able to the fact brother Brown said The Prostitute would walk across the platform and God at judgment and never look up but religious hypocritical Pharisees will come up and say have not I done all of these things look at me you was there when I done it you say depart from me I never knew you knew there as brother dick says means to be pregnant with a word he never knew it a relationship that's right right we're supposed to be children of God by relationship not intercourse right but by a new birth that's right the birth of the word let's Stand Together come on that's right think on these things The Germ of Life we'll go out this spring and we'll plant some corn beans potatoes Etc if that germ of life is not in there it don't make no difference right now you tell me that God doesn't know what he's doing and let me just Express what brother brandham said as I said a while ago in the he said like in the birth of a little calf he said that there's millions of eggs and millions of germs now you go back let's see I believe it's invisible union he says it like this he said see all of them was alive you know that every one of them little wiggle Tails as we call them would be capable of producing a another cave sure if he just went through the right process see we think one of them is all alive no one of them was chosen to live the others was alive but died right cuz that's God's predestination he said how come you wound up to be redheaded and all your families behind you was all blackheaded or blonde headed or something he said keep on checking you'll find out great great great great great grandmother back there cuz that's what the people of the message don't even realize you inherit from your mother cuz the egg that she produces is what brings the body that's right and you can look exactly like your mother it's the bloodstream that comes from the father and you can look exactly like your mother and you can run the DNA all the way back through the mother to find out whether or not it matches we just don't study enough D go ahead brother dick what we got 341 in the red book let's start off with the verse Satan like a roaring my inory to and thinking the god his PR overing power is he is in Greater is he greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world on the day ofing Mighty Wind B into the upper and Bap all them with the power greater than any Earthly I'm glad I got anybody have a need are you in that body cuz if you're not in that body it doesn't matter how much an intellectual understanding you have if you don't have the new birth then you're not in the body of Christ I don't care if you born in the family how long you've been in the family mom and daddy my kids my grandkids my great grandkid they've all got to have their own Holy Ghost my wife's got to have hurs so if I was you and didn't know exactly I had it I wouldn't sto you would have been back there where I was at cuz I seen it and I seen I didn't have it and everywhere we went to church I guess them people got tired of praying for me for 2 years brother how and him I come up to pray for me I want to baptism of the Holy Ghost but it matter it took two years but hard head to get where it be birth see if you don't have that new birth our sister need PR for physical need in her body because she's not able to sleep let's just believe all right let's believe and receive I want to lay hands on you but I want to

totally from away because we believe you Jesus is your name anybody else believe God release your faith just release it and just say God I'm Healed whatever I have need of that's the only way I get anything is the way I go to goder is he I don't just pray one prayer and then quit and that's good because we ought to pray and believe it right but sometimes we don't believe it so we keep praying until we believe it I don't have no trouble saying that faith is the substance of things far but there's a lot of difference in my faith and God's faith when God's faith come I don't pray no more because it's finished but until that time comes I pray and I believe our sister said she had a headache but it's gone we believe it just take the word believe it say thank you with the power greater
