[9:43] change over the service

[11:28] you Amen And amen and amen I want to see
[11:31] him Don't you good to see everybody in
[11:33] the house of the Lord If you'd like to
[11:34] turn in your scriptures where we've been
[11:37] reading turn to Revelations 1 and then
[11:39] we'll go to Ephesians 1
[11:43] and try to continue the thought on that
[11:46] we were talking on this morning Remember
[11:48] now the Lord willing brother Forny will
[11:50] be with us to minister for us this
[11:53] coming Wednesday I chose that because
[11:57] we're going to move move over the
[11:58] fellowship meeting and that way Wade can
[12:01] take one service next weekend and I can
[12:02] take one and that'll kind of balance up
[12:04] cause of the fellowship meeting and two
[12:07] I'm supposed to have a tooth implant You
[12:09] know they're going to drill a hole drive
[12:11] one and rod down inside of your jaw you
[12:13] know all this that and supposed to do
[12:14] that Tuesday So y'all remember me at
[12:17] that time that they'll get it in there
[12:19] right because if those things don't work
[12:21] you take them out and throw them away
[12:22] and it's the same cost whether they work
[12:24] or not They don't seem to care whether
[12:27] they work They just want to get them in
[12:29] there But you know pray the Lord will
[12:31] make it all work out to to the right All
[12:34] right And then brother Forny be with us
[12:35] Remember we'll be leaving the Lord
[12:37] willing now 10:00 on Saturday going to
[12:41] the fellowship meeting at brother Tom
[12:43] Kershain Remember that Pray that the
[12:46] Lord would be with us All that all who
[12:48] want to go now let us know where we can
[12:50] make arrangements and get everything in
[12:53] the right order because that's the
[12:55] longest trip we have because it's all
[12:57] the way across the mountain area It's a
[13:00] hard drive but remember
[13:02] that Anything else we all remember
[13:06] brother Gary pray the Lord would would
[13:08] touch him and bring him on out of this
[13:11] situation that he's in because we
[13:13] believe the word We believe the word
[13:16] says it We believe that by his stripes
[13:17] he's healed You know the Lord's stripes
[13:20] brother Gary's healed And we believe
[13:22] that We just ask him to apply it then to
[13:26] him to deliver him out of it All right
[13:29] And just and remember Rebecca you know
[13:32] during the time because her having to
[13:35] take care of him is hard on her to you
[13:38] know to working with and doing with him
[13:41] and everything you know And I pray that
[13:43] the Lord would bless her All right Uh
[13:47] that's all I guess Father we thank you
[13:49] for all that you've given us We know
[13:52] that you've given to us freely So we
[13:54] don't have to pay for anything That's a
[13:56] wonderful thing And Lord what about a
[13:58] day and an hour don't have to buy a
[13:59] thing Don't have to pay for nothing All
[14:01] we got to do is believe it and accept it
[14:03] and let you do the rest of it We ask you
[14:05] now that you'd be with us and that you'd
[14:07] touch each heart and lives this
[14:09] afternoon that we may see
[14:12] you through the opening of your word and
[14:15] Lord be led therein that your light
[14:18] would shine Father you said that through
[14:21] the prophet that when the bride realizes
[14:24] who she is and what she's here for then
[14:26] she will then be an invincible army So
[14:29] Lord we've had 40 something years to try
[14:32] to
[14:33] prepare since the leaving of the prophet
[14:35] and we pray that you would just help
[14:37] each and every one of us forgive our
[14:39] sins cleanse us and guide us in Jesus'
[14:43] name
[14:44] Amen All
[14:46] right
[14:51] Revelations 1 verse 12 And I turned to
[14:53] see the voice that spake with me and
[14:55] being turned I saw seven golden
[14:57] candlesticks And in the midst of the
[14:59] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[15:01] of man clothed with a garment down to
[15:03] the foot and gird about the pouch with a
[15:05] golden girdle His head and his hairs
[15:08] were white like wool as white as snow
[15:10] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[15:13] his feet like unto fine bryce and as if
[15:16] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[15:19] is a sound of many
[15:23] waters We won't we don't want to go on
[15:26] to any further We will go a little
[15:28] further eventually but that's all right
[15:31] We want to try to get this point then
[15:34] we'll move on cuz I hope that you're
[15:37] relating what we're reading in
[15:38] Revelations to what we're doing now
[15:41] because it's talking about where he is
[15:45] now in you and I All right let's go to
[15:50] Ephesians now and we'll read starting
[15:53] with verse nine to save time Having made
[15:56] ver Ephesians 1 vers9 having made known
[15:59] unto us the mystery of his will
[16:01] according to his good pleasure which he
[16:03] hath purposed in himself that in the
[16:06] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[16:08] might gather together in one all things
[16:11] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[16:14] which are on earth even in him and whom
[16:17] also we have obtained an inheritance
[16:19] being predestinated according to the
[16:21] purpose of him who workketh all things
[16:23] after the counsel of of his own will
[16:26] that we should be to the praise of his
[16:28] glory You first trusted in Christ In
[16:31] whom you also trusted after that you
[16:34] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[16:36] your salvation In whom also after that
[16:40] you believed you were sealed with that
[16:43] Holy Spirit of promise which is the
[16:45] earnest of our inheritance until the
[16:47] redemption of the purchased possession
[16:50] unto the praise of his glory You may be
[16:52] seated The Lord add his blessing to the
[16:54] reading of the word Remember we use also
[16:58] Ephesians
[17:00] 4:30 to talk about whereby you are
[17:05] sealed until the day of your
[17:08] redemption All right now to not back up
[17:12] a lot but to just maybe pick up a few
[17:17] thoughts and then continue on into the
[17:21] message of what we're seeing now I want
[17:25] you to put this into your mind and I
[17:27] want you to think because this is the
[17:31] way I I think All right and uh you know
[17:36] I count myself to be the dumbest of
[17:38] dummies And if if the dummy can think
[17:42] then surely you ought to be able to
[17:44] think a whole lot better than I do you
[17:45] know and and understand because that's
[17:48] the way I count it That's not a uh just
[17:51] trying to be an humble you know me No no
[17:53] That's the way I count it Because
[17:55] remember the Bible says everything we
[17:58] have
[18:00] what God gave it to us
[18:05] Now that's scripture Okay Now I I've
[18:09] years ago I saw something in the
[18:11] prophet's message and I've tried to
[18:14] express it for somewhere in the 30 years
[18:16] at
[18:17] least and through about 82 and right in
[18:20] there when I begin to preach on the
[18:22] seals and the Daniel 70 weeks and the
[18:24] thing and I saw
[18:26] something of how that you can take the
[18:30] Bible and the prophets message you know
[18:34] and you can you can lay a subject or a
[18:37] thought or try to bring a a
[18:42] um message through the Bible and you can
[18:46] relate it I do it like this You can you
[18:48] can relate the whole
[18:50] Bible and all and bring it to in
[18:53] relation to faith which is your new
[18:56] birth All right and no matter what depth
[19:00] the prophet brings it or the Bible goes
[19:03] through those things will all u bring
[19:07] forth the same story Beautiful picture
[19:10] just enhances or what is the word uh
[19:13] magnifies or or whatever you want to do
[19:16] See then you can turn around and and see
[19:18] you say well okay it takes justification
[19:21] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[19:22] Ghost to to get to faith All right we
[19:25] believe that the new birth See then you
[19:28] got to climbing up the pyramid the
[19:30] statue of a perfect man up to where it
[19:32] says Holy Spirit And when you do then
[19:35] you can in that take the scriptures and
[19:38] the things that will be that we want to
[19:41] relate this group to this this group to
[19:44] this and this group to this And that
[19:46] that works out That's all right That's
[19:49] doing But remember you can't have this
[19:53] bringing something and the second stage
[19:57] bringing something different and the
[19:59] third stage bringing something different
[20:02] Right you can't do that throughout the
[20:04] Bible See because what would it do you'd
[20:06] have a white dog here and a black dog
[20:08] here and a pale dog here and and you'd
[20:10] just be all messed up Because you see
[20:12] the prophet when he brings the message
[20:15] he brings justification sanctification
[20:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be the
[20:18] new birth up through the statue of a
[20:20] perfect man You can take justification
[20:22] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[20:24] Ghost to climb the statue of a perfect
[20:26] man because it's the opening of the word
[20:28] Then the headstone when it comes you can
[20:31] cover it through justification
[20:32] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[20:34] Ghost and see like you get into
[20:36] invisible union I believe is one of them
[20:40] especially where he really covers if
[20:42] you'll read the message or listen to it
[20:44] you'll hear him talking about
[20:46] justification he's just talking about
[20:48] the new birth but all at once it seems
[20:51] like he just takes a great leap into
[20:54] things and and you got to really listen
[20:58] because he'll say here he'll say
[21:00] justification chopped off your p
[21:03] sins that's
[21:05] Then in a minute he'll
[21:07] say you know it it's not that it said
[21:12] it's it's you're forgiven
[21:14] All right Then in a little bit in the
[21:16] message he'll say the real you never did
[21:19] do it Right Well he's done went into
[21:21] three stages
[21:23] of development or whatever you want to
[21:25] call it through into one
[21:27] message that would carry a believer in
[21:31] this day from this faith at the bottom
[21:33] all the way through the pyramid and out
[21:35] to the headstone Amen And be the same
[21:39] scriptures Amen
[21:43] Right
[21:44] Let's see if I can get to one in
[21:47] mind What is it i'll think of it in a
[21:50] minute Uh where he refers and brother
[21:52] Brandham puts it in the
[21:54] millennium He relates that scripture
[21:56] puts it in the millennium Well I thought
[21:59] well now okay I better keep studying
[22:02] this thought because I'm trying to bring
[22:04] it this way And I kept going through the
[22:07] message and running the quotes And after
[22:09] a while I found that he takes one
[22:11] scripture puts it places it in the
[22:14] millennium Then in a little while he's
[22:15] got the same scripture in the future
[22:17] home
[22:19] He didn't have to go get him another
[22:21] scripture
[22:22] you
[22:23] know he he's taking that same scripture
[22:27] but it keeps climbing higher and higher
[22:32] throughout the word All right and you
[22:34] can't make this over here one scripture
[22:37] and then make the same scripture
[22:39] contrary
[22:43] It won't work folks That don't work in
[22:45] the Bible Amen It don't work in the
[22:47] prophet's message So then sometimes we
[22:49] need to sit down and think about what's
[22:51] being said All
[22:53] right Now the same thing to me in the
[22:57] new birth
[22:59] You can't take how you come to the new
[23:03] birth and make your growth or
[23:06] development of the stature of a very man
[23:08] some other way
[23:10] and then the headstone coming to be some
[23:13] other way or thought It's further
[23:16] development
[23:19] It's just opening up of the same
[23:22] scripture as you're climbing and see one
[23:25] person sitting there then and I realize
[23:28] that and I I watch it and and a lot of
[23:30] times if you'll notice me I'll say
[23:32] something to kind of click it because
[23:35] I'll see that part of the group is on on
[23:39] the
[23:40] justification you know all right and
[23:43] part of the group is developed enough to
[23:46] understand that it can be fit into a
[23:48] deeper meaning then I I see that some
[23:51] can put it over here into a higher
[23:54] meaning and it's all the same Bible
[23:58] That's what's so
[24:00] wonderful The new birth right
[24:03] here and brother Brandham said you're
[24:06] birthed into these virtues
[24:10] And then you must be birthed into the
[24:12] headstone Amen All right And now you'll
[24:16] see then why the prophet said as we were
[24:19] giving this morning getting to that
[24:20] point he said why you'll see that there
[24:23] is is not too
[24:26] many
[24:28] genuine new births
[24:33] now I'm sure that when he said
[24:36] that he
[24:39] thought he probably was thinking well
[24:42] that's right because the Bible says is
[24:45] fear not little flock
[24:48] you know it's the father's good pleasure
[24:51] all right but I keep that is the way
[24:55] that I do and the way I think and it'll
[24:58] just climb and it'll climb and it'll
[24:59] climb and it'll climb and climb on out
[25:02] until I hope one of these days we leave
[25:03] here
[25:05] all right now what were we talking about
[25:08] this
[25:09] morning the new
[25:12] birth is not your shouting your crying
[25:15] your
[25:15] doings That is the after effect of the
[25:18] birth That's what you do after you have
[25:20] the birth All right then the new birth
[25:24] then is the birth of the word and it's
[25:27] the word you've heard And we went
[25:30] through that with the scripture that
[25:31] they took the word and kept it in the
[25:33] parables And then it was the moisture
[25:36] came and it produced uh 20 40 60 or what
[25:41] 20 40 800 whatever it goes And I told
[25:43] you that's not meaning uh that this is
[25:46] not as good as this over here It's the
[25:49] same 20 and 40 is just two times that
[25:53] But it's not two times that It's just
[25:55] the same thing in another way of
[25:57] expressing it And see but if you'll take
[25:59] it and follow it you'll follow it Say
[26:02] Luther's age was justification and all
[26:05] they could produce was that part which
[26:08] would say 20% of what needed to be done
[26:11] Wesley's age maybe 40% This age has got
[26:15] to come to the 100% or 60fold or
[26:18] whatever It's got to be done in this age
[26:20] because there's got to be a change All
[26:22] right
[26:24] And I've went over it and went over it
[26:26] Here's one more time You're not born
[26:28] again in your
[26:30] body You're not born again in your
[26:32] spirit You're born again in your soul
[26:36] All right Then
[26:39] justification being a work of the Holy
[26:43] Spirit Sanctification being a work of
[26:45] the Holy Spirit But the baptism is the
[26:48] Holy Spirit Remember that quote All
[26:50] right So then justification is working
[26:53] on the soul of the individual Amen To
[26:56] get that individual to repent to clean
[27:00] out you know All right Sanctification
[27:02] comes into the cleansing and setting
[27:06] aside
[27:09] of the individual And it took Jesus
[27:12] about three and a half years to finally
[27:15] come to word that he
[27:16] could say in St John 17 you know you're
[27:20] clean through the word spoken unto you
[27:22] Sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[27:24] is truth All right so you're justified
[27:27] by faith by accepting Jesus Christ as
[27:30] your savior repentance followed by water
[27:34] baptism to show your repentance is
[27:36] correct and that your faith is is
[27:39] genuine in yourself and then you're
[27:42] cleansed by the word of God that you
[27:45] hear and that comes by as we we're in
[27:48] the scripture know faith cometh by
[27:50] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[27:53] all right that's what cleanses us and
[27:55] that's why a lot of people's not clean
[27:58] now I'm not throwing no stones I just
[28:00] plainly talk That's why you see that a
[28:04] lot of people especially you follow the
[28:06] ranks of the message people and you'll
[28:08] see them in the altar and I'm you
[28:11] forgive me if you think I'm going wrong
[28:12] cuz I'm not It's you thinking wrong
[28:14] right but you'll see somebody in the
[28:16] altar one day praying crying shouting
[28:19] glory hallelujah They get up they're
[28:21] okay But you go to the next meeting
[28:24] especially a year later the same person
[28:25] is in the altar crying praying Now don't
[28:28] think I'm against that
[28:31] I'm just saying why didn't they get
[28:32] something
[28:36] you think the preachers of this message
[28:38] ain't going to have to stand one day and
[28:39] give an answer
[28:41] now may I quote the
[28:43] scripture did not Jesus say you what you
[28:47] stand in the door and won't go in and
[28:52] won't let them go in What about a bunch
[28:54] of people that you could talk about like
[28:56] that or just one person it would be or
[29:00] whatever
[29:02] that somebody that would stand in the
[29:03] door that person would have to be vastly
[29:06] deceived
[29:09] cuz truly they wouldn't be wanting to do
[29:10] that in their own to
[29:13] deceive But they're so deceived until
[29:15] they think they're right
[29:18] and they won't let nobody else come in
[29:20] and they won't go in themselves All
[29:22] right
[29:25] Now but we talked
[29:28] about that coming to the new birth Then
[29:33] the one thing the disciples needed after
[29:37] they come through the justification by
[29:39] faith the cleansing of the washing of
[29:42] the water of the word So you can use
[29:44] that there and then you can use it over
[29:46] later and all And uh then they would
[29:49] come to the point that they had heard
[29:51] the word and the word had driven out
[29:54] that unclean spirit out of the soul of
[29:58] those individuals but yet they were
[30:00] still not right Right Great mechanical
[30:04] situation you would call it you know
[30:06] that they would
[30:08] uh be said in the word that they would
[30:12] believe the word and they would see
[30:14] signs and wonders
[30:16] miracles transpiring but yet they would
[30:19] not have the moisture to make the word
[30:23] live All right So if the seed is the
[30:26] word of
[30:28] God then you must have life to come you
[30:32] know something to cause that to come
[30:34] forth So what the disciples needed was
[30:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:42] And you know what brother Brown said the
[30:44] problem with
[30:46] Judas what did he say he didn't make it
[30:50] to Pentecost That's right
[30:53] He don't throw off on him
[30:56] He don't preach no long lengthy sermons
[30:58] how bad a devil Judas was Right
[31:02] No he just tells it like it is And the
[31:05] Bible said he was a thief from the
[31:07] beginning He just puts it in the way it
[31:09] is But everybody else must have thought
[31:11] he's a pretty good guy cuz he was the
[31:13] secretary and treasurer the you know the
[31:15] the
[31:18] paid the bills All right But now he
[31:21] didn't make it to Pentecost Right
[31:26] see he didn't take the word that the
[31:29] others had allowed that word to develop
[31:33] them into a situation that God could
[31:38] come on the scene then and quicken that
[31:41] word to those disciples All right And at
[31:47] 120 they uh they held on Amen But he was
[31:52] seen of over 500 brethren Let's see if I
[31:55] can pick that up Brother Joe who's back
[31:58] brother Joe pull up five 4a and let's
[32:01] read first Corinthians 15 All right
[32:04] Because we need to do that A lot of
[32:06] people you know some people say "I don't
[32:07] know whether that's in the Bible I was
[32:08] talking to a man one day." He said "I
[32:10] don't even know whether that's in the
[32:11] message or not." I said "You'll hang on
[32:13] just a
[32:13] minute I'll give it to you but I'll tell
[32:16] you what it is." I said 'If that ain't
[32:20] what the prophet
[32:22] said I said 'I'll hang my sign on my
[32:25] back and you can call me anything you
[32:28] want
[32:29] to Well he wasn't interested in me
[32:32] taking long enough to look it up But see
[32:34] a lot of people don't think about the
[32:37] scriptures And look what it
[32:39] says And he that was buried and that he
[32:43] was buried and that he arose again the
[32:45] third day according to the scriptures
[32:47] And that he was seen of Cphus everybody
[32:50] how you pronounce that word Then of the
[32:52] 12 Then after that he was seen of above
[32:56] 500 brethren at once
[33:00] Which means if that opportunity happened
[33:02] there was probably a whole lot more than
[33:04] that right in different ways but at one
[33:06] time Now watch what he says of whom the
[33:09] greater part remain unto this
[33:12] present but some are fallen
[33:15] asleep after he seen of James next he
[33:18] was seen of him born out of due
[33:20] season he doesn't say that those 500 was
[33:23] lost
[33:26] he calls them brethren
[33:28] and he says even the greatest portion of
[33:31] them still remain
[33:35] you know
[33:36] witnesses all
[33:38] But why didn't they go to the upper room
[33:43] amen They evidently didn't let that word
[33:47] come inside of them to clean out that
[33:50] unclean spirit
[33:52] that doing But yet they were great
[33:54] religious
[33:57] people Could that be you and I
[34:04] well brother Dale you are not preached
[34:06] to people who's been in the message a
[34:08] long time that they need to be born
[34:10] again Well who am I going to preach it
[34:12] to amen You know I mean
[34:21] I believe the greatest missionary place
[34:24] in the world is in America
[34:27] to the people of this so-called message
[34:30] that they need missionaries more than
[34:33] anywhere in the
[34:35] world to come express to them what the
[34:38] prophet has said
[34:40] You remember what I told the brother
[34:41] when we went
[34:43] to overseas together and they were done
[34:47] a mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar
[34:48] mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar
[34:48] mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar
[34:48] mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar mar
[34:48] mar marvelous job of presenting the
[34:49] prophet and the message and I told him I
[34:52] said but brother I said what are you
[34:54] going to do next year are you going to
[34:57] take that same 300 people that you had
[34:59] are you going to put them through the
[35:00] same story of the prophet and the
[35:03] message and the Bible I said why not put
[35:06] that 300 over in a group to theirel and
[35:08] let somebody teach
[35:10] what the prophet taught and then get you
[35:13] two or 30 hund more to start with Well
[35:15] even from a foreign country came the
[35:18] message that said "You've brought us the
[35:20] prophet's message Now come and teach us
[35:24] what he said."
[35:31] But get off of it
[35:36] But you
[35:37] see Romans 10:17 says "Faith cometh by
[35:42] hearing
[35:44] and
[35:46] hearing by the word."
[35:49] So then the new birth is the birth of
[35:53] the word right
[35:57] and it's the word you
[36:00] hear I said it there the other day and I
[36:03] keep saying it See all of this doctrines
[36:05] and ideas of you come here with this
[36:07] seed in you I believe what the prophet
[36:09] said about that I've preached it to you
[36:11] I believe you come here with this you
[36:13] come here with eternal life I believe
[36:15] the way he says it that if you if you
[36:19] have eternal life you always was eternal
[36:22] I believe John says that if his seed
[36:24] remainth in you he you cannot sin I
[36:27] believe that What is it can't sin the
[36:30] seed
[36:31] I believe
[36:32] that I don't
[37:43] Would it be a wonderful night
[38:07] the anointing of that Holy Spirit
[38:24] I can find
[38:29] ever you would be taking away all your
[38:32] scriptures and all your things by doing
[38:34] that So I wrote it like
[38:37] this Do you truly
[38:41] understand about the
[38:44] soul what do you think about
[38:48] it the soul of
[38:51] mankind What do you think of the new
[38:56] birth see I believe the new birth is the
[38:59] birth of the word that you have
[39:02] heard and you let it drive out that
[39:19] and has driven out the old nature of
[39:21] that
[39:24] soul by the word that you've
[39:27] heard not driven the soul out See just
[39:30] don't don't take all those things out
[39:32] That's why we spent that part on a new
[39:34] heart and a new spirit
[39:37] Because remember
[39:41] now our nature of the cleansing is not
[39:44] the
[39:45] body It's not the spirit The nature of
[39:49] cleansing has to be in the heart The
[39:53] Bible says I give you a new heart a new
[39:57] spirit All right and the heart being in
[40:00] the
[40:03] soul right
[40:07] the heart being the soul of mankind So
[40:09] it wasn't when your soul went out It
[40:11] when your body went out or when your
[40:13] spirit it went out It's God working on
[40:16] the nature from the inside out
[40:21] Because you can have every bit of it
[40:22] lined up in the flesh and that will not
[40:24] save you You can stop doing or quit
[40:27] doing or do do or whatever you want to
[40:28] do It don't matter You remember brother
[40:30] Ram said that way day he said that man
[40:33] said what must we do to be saved he said
[40:34] "We tell him what he ought to quit We
[40:36] tell him what he ought to do." Said he
[40:38] didn't ask that question He asked the
[40:39] question "How can I say to be saved?" We
[40:41] don't tell him how to be saved We tell
[40:43] him how to
[40:46] quit Oh that's well and
[40:48] good But if there's not a birth there
[40:52] it's only legalism forms you have
[40:56] See by the planting of the
[40:59] word you know the sowing of the word
[41:05] Now take this please just for a minute
[41:07] and take it like I was trying to explain
[41:09] a minute
[41:10] ago Take the 40 something years that
[41:13] we've heard the prophet's
[41:14] message that even you would claim the
[41:17] new
[41:20] birth What has it done for us
[41:29] and what has it done to most of the
[41:32] preachers of this message when most of
[41:34] them it's been around 40 years are
[41:36] turning against the prophet they've done
[41:38] every kind of
[41:43] thing I don't get
[41:46] it see by the planting of the natural
[41:50] seed into the ground you can come forth
[41:53] with whatever you plant all right so
[41:56] then by the planting of the
[42:00] word pure and unadulterated
[42:04] Then you can expect a new nature to come
[42:08] within the
[42:10] individual which would be dwelling in
[42:12] the person's heart or soul
[42:19] See because that's what you're looking
[42:20] at It's not to destroy your
[42:25] soul but it's to wash that soul or to
[42:29] change its nature Right
[42:33] Right now is it true the prophet said
[42:36] "If it was
[42:38] possible for you to take that nature out
[42:42] of that hog
[42:44] and put the nature of the lamb in the
[42:47] hog he said the
[42:50] lamb would control the nature of the hog
[42:54] and the hog wouldn't be a hog anymore
[42:56] rooting in the ground."
[42:59] All right
[43:01] See now we tried to cover this and just
[43:04] hid
[43:05] it See you cannot
[43:11] birth
[43:12] word God cannot birth a
[43:16] trinity because there's no such a thing
[43:18] Right
[43:20] Something clicked on the air conditioner
[43:22] brother Aaron So don't let us get too
[43:26] hot Even if you have to run the fan
[43:30] See you cannot
[43:32] birth word that is not
[43:38] pure How can you How can you birth a
[43:41] trinity i got a revelation of the
[43:44] trinity Now where'd you get
[43:49] it it's not even in the Bible So how'd
[43:52] you get it
[43:54] all right Now watch the point of what
[43:56] I'm driving at on that You cannot birth
[44:00] the old
[44:07] nature no more than you can birth a
[44:09] trinity to anybody
[44:12] You can't birth the old
[44:14] nature That's why it has to be that that
[44:19] unclean spirit is driven out That's the
[44:22] old nature part
[44:26] which is driven
[44:28] out because you can't birth that old
[44:31] nature
[44:34] Now where would you
[44:36] be you birth the old nature and you got
[44:40] as I said you know you got somebody in
[44:43] the honky tons or something and you got
[44:45] somebody out there living like the
[44:47] devil and then they get a new birth and
[44:51] the next day you see them and they're
[44:53] just out living like the devil that they
[44:55] was It didn't change anything Now
[44:57] something went wrong right we're old
[45:00] enough to realize something went wrong
[45:01] there cuz that's that's not right All
[45:04] right see that 500
[45:09] brethren that he was seen of 380 of them
[45:14] and not saying they didn't come to it
[45:16] later but saying the point they did not
[45:19] go to the upper room to receive the Holy
[45:23] Ghost for some reason they were not
[45:27] ready for the Holy Ghost at that time
[45:31] maybe they received it later that's fine
[45:34] but they were not ready at that
[45:37] time All right And like I said if it's
[45:40] just some outpouring last Sunday I was
[45:43] trying to illustrate if it's just some
[45:45] outpouring of the Holy Spirit down upon
[45:48] mankind why wasn't they more than the
[45:51] 3,000 outside
[45:55] why was there not more than 120 why
[45:57] didn't theund When 120 get it why didn't
[45:59] the 3,000 get it
[46:03] right They didn't get it You had to go
[46:07] down there and preach to them later
[46:10] You see we're we're messing up our own
[46:12] thinking All right See you see then why
[46:15] I believe in the new birth is the birth
[46:18] of the word that you take into your
[46:22] being your soul You don't call it heart
[46:25] whatever you bringing it but you
[46:27] bringing it into the soul of
[46:29] mankind And then the Holy Ghost can come
[46:33] down and make that word alive that
[46:38] you've held or as a prophet would use it
[46:41] irrigate it You know the
[46:45] moisture that would be coming All right
[46:48] Then on the three cycles of mankind that
[46:51] we look at outside seat taste fields mel
[46:54] here the second realm you know memories
[46:56] and in the third part being the inner
[46:59] part See then the word would go through
[47:03] those outer senses into that inner sense
[47:07] of mankind and drive
[47:10] out that unclean spirit
[47:15] All right and then driving it
[47:19] out It would leave that inside man
[47:23] clean set
[47:26] aside Then the Holy Ghost can come back
[47:29] you know or come upon the
[47:32] individual and make that word alive
[47:38] All right
[47:41] but you see the anointed
[47:43] one which the Holy Spirit comes upon
[47:46] their spirit
[47:53] right it can't make the word
[47:56] alive that's not in there to be made
[47:59] alive
[48:02] So if they take some other idea or
[48:05] thought contrary to
[48:08] it how can the Lord make it alive
[48:13] right
[48:17] see then the new birth is the word made
[48:22] alive by the spirit of God
[48:25] where the Holy Ghost comes in and makes
[48:28] that word
[48:30] alive All
[48:32] right Now that's why I use the circles
[48:35] to show you and I believe
[48:37] it that the anointing can come down upon
[48:40] an
[48:41] individual and anoint their spirit with
[48:44] a genuine Holy Spirit but the prophet
[48:46] says they're still
[48:49] lost Now how come it can come down upon
[48:52] one person though and they get a new
[48:57] birth is God a respector of persons
[49:02] is that just another one of those
[49:03] thoughts of the seed that I come here
[49:10] with i'm asking you those questions
[49:19] Then if the new birth is and we'll get
[49:21] to this in the next message more for
[49:24] short that it is a revelation of the
[49:31] word is your new
[49:35] birth Then it means that
[49:39] word being revealed to
[49:41] you is that Holy Spirit
[49:45] quickening making alive that word that
[49:49] the disciples were holding until they
[49:51] got to the upper
[49:53] room That's supposed to be what it is in
[49:55] you and
[49:57] I So if we've never heard the word
[50:00] correctly
[50:04] preached I would
[50:07] wonder I had some people that asked me a
[50:09] question years
[50:11] ago said "I've been baptized in the name
[50:14] of Jesus
[50:15] Christ." I said "Well that's acceptable
[50:17] because it does say that." Technically
[50:20] the Bible does not say Lord Jesus Christ
[50:22] Brother Random put Lord Jesus Christ but
[50:24] that's what it does say because it said
[50:25] Lord over here and it said Jesus Christ
[50:27] over here But in Acts two there it says
[50:29] in the name of Jesus
[50:31] Christ And they said would you accept
[50:34] the baptism of just the name of Jesus
[50:37] Christ i said I'll ask you one
[50:42] question I said was that baptism in the
[50:45] name of Jesus Christ under
[50:50] regeneration and they knew that I knew
[50:52] what I talking about because the church
[50:54] they were in baptized under regeneration
[50:57] Even though it was baptized in the name
[50:59] of Jesus Christ it was under
[51:00] regeneration believing that the water
[51:02] baptism saves you There are people who
[51:04] baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:09] Christ That really they are believing
[51:11] water baptism under
[51:14] regeneration So I told the person that
[51:16] asked me that I said "I'm not telling
[51:20] you what you need to do I'm telling you
[51:22] what I'd
[51:24] do If I was in a church that believed
[51:27] water baptism under regeneration
[51:32] Well immediately upon hearing the word I
[51:35] would be baptized in the name of the
[51:36] Lord Jesus Christ Again
[51:41] I'm honest That's is truthful Don't ask
[51:44] me a question if you don't want the
[51:45] answer I'll try my best to give you the
[51:47] I hope it's
[51:48] correct What would you do well that's
[51:51] okay You baptized the name Lord Lord
[51:53] Jesus Christ No but if you believe in
[51:55] that was under regeneration
[52:00] You're you're I don't I'm
[52:04] sorry And that's why a lot of people
[52:06] come to me and say "Brother Dale I
[52:07] really didn't know how I was baptized."
[52:09] My wife said she don't know how she was
[52:11] baptized because the guy that was
[52:12] baptizing her was brother Lickers and
[52:14] and him and brother Mike up in
[52:16] Gainesville and they were standing in
[52:17] the ice water and the ice was
[52:25] frozen to death and I had an overcoat
[52:28] and was standing on the bank with a hat
[52:29] on and I was freezing to death and we
[52:32] come up out of the water she had ice in
[52:34] her hair and everything but she said I
[52:37] said honey I believe I heard it
[52:39] correctly You know it's you know but
[52:43] think about it
[52:45] now We don't want to try to bypass
[52:49] things That's what I see in the
[52:51] Christian realm Maybe it's not the
[52:53] terminologies or the correct way of
[52:55] saying it but I see a lot of people
[52:58] trying to bypass because they they they
[53:01] don't want to go back and do something
[53:03] again you know to make sure they're
[53:05] right and they want to bypass it and and
[53:08] go on Well I'm just kind of like I was
[53:12] and I told it I was baptized father son
[53:15] holy ghost in a river over there at home
[53:17] I got baptized in the name of the Lord
[53:18] Jesus Christ in that same
[53:20] river We went over to Israel and uh I
[53:24] got baptized in the name of the Lord
[53:26] Jesus Christ in the River Jordan And if
[53:28] I went to Mara I go back
[53:30] again and I get baptized again Well you
[53:33] don't believe what you done was right No
[53:35] no no no no I just fact you
[53:39] know I just won't I enjoy doing it you
[53:43] know and I do it again right see it
[53:46] doesn't show how super religious I am to
[53:49] deny
[53:52] anything Sometimes it shows the wrong
[53:54] thing All
[53:57] right But now before I go back through
[53:59] the statement that I've made before and
[54:01] made it Sunday I want to express
[54:04] something to
[54:06] you Have you noticed in the scriptures
[54:09] we read
[54:13] today that it says you were sealed by
[54:16] the Holy
[54:21] Spirit sealed by the Holy Spirit
[54:26] the prophet and expressing it "If you'd
[54:28] like these be glad to find." He said
[54:30] "He's sealed out and you're sealed
[54:34] in." Well then is the seal inside or is
[54:37] it on
[54:42] outside it's supposed to be made
[54:44] manifest through the spirit and the body
[54:48] as to what the seal is Am I right amen
[54:53] And he's supposed to really be sealed
[54:55] out of the body and spirit as far as God
[54:57] is concerned But we know that that
[55:00] doesn't maybe do it all the time because
[55:02] he still has those inroads
[55:04] but it's sealed out Grieve not the Holy
[55:08] Spirit whereby you are
[55:11] sealed And it says here as we read the
[55:14] scripture that it talks about seemingly
[55:17] looking and see watch it go into another
[55:19] stage another
[55:21] stage In whom you also trusted after
[55:26] that you heard the word of truth That's
[55:28] right The gospel of your salvation In
[55:31] whom also after that you believed you
[55:35] were
[55:36] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[55:40] That's right
[55:42] Right
[55:45] Have you ever been sealed by the Holy
[55:47] Spirit
[55:50] that's the question Do you really know
[55:53] that you've been sealed in
[55:56] and he's sealed out you remember a few
[55:57] weeks ago we were bringing the
[55:59] statements of what where the prophet
[56:01] said you know the devil He said no Said
[56:04] you went out to him
[56:09] He said he can't get into where you're
[56:10] at Said because he'd have to be
[56:12] justified sanctified filled with the
[56:13] Holy Ghost to get where you're
[56:16] at All right
[56:18] So then the Holy Spirit is a seal unto
[56:22] us See what I want us to get to of
[56:25] thinking one day Doesn't it make you
[56:28] little maybe think sometime of the
[56:31] statements brother Brandon will make
[56:32] he'll say it's you and God together as
[56:35] persons
[56:36] That's one
[56:39] statement And he'll say God come into
[56:43] you and you're dead and gone
[56:50] all kind of
[56:51] statements that am I the only one that
[56:55] is so carnal that when I run across
[56:57] those things I
[56:59] say what's he getting
[57:03] at you know what is he trying to
[57:09] say might find some secret nuggets
[57:12] laying there once you really see how
[57:14] those things transpire
[57:18] how that he would say you're I
[57:20] conclusively prove that you're born
[57:22] again and then baptized into the body
[57:25] and at other times he'll say the born
[57:27] again experiences the new birth and you
[57:30] can't be born again without the Holy
[57:32] Ghost coming in in
[57:35] you
[57:37] see does God come down and live in
[57:41] you as another
[57:43] person contrary to you as a
[57:47] person or does he come into you and make
[57:50] your make you eternal
[57:56] see maybe we're missing the new birth on
[57:58] that point that we're not seeing that he
[58:02] he comes down and anoints the word that
[58:06] we have
[58:08] heard Then you the devil can't come
[58:11] along and say
[58:13] "Well I know you say you got the baptism
[58:16] but said here the prophet said you can
[58:18] have the baptism all every day of your
[58:20] life and go to hell." Y'all wasn't
[58:22] around in the early days when we didn't
[58:25] have all the quotes and didn't have all
[58:28] of the messages and things you know to
[58:31] be able to check something with And I
[58:33] remember when that was really hammered
[58:36] pretty heavy by preachers because you
[58:38] could say anything and they say "Brother
[58:40] Brandon said you be baptized in the Holy
[58:42] Ghost every day of your life die and go
[58:44] to hell." See there you can be saved and
[58:46] lost I said he didn't say that That's
[58:49] right He didn't say you can be saved and
[58:51] lost He says you can't be saved and lost
[58:53] if you're really truly saved Now if
[58:55] you're pretending saving you're still
[58:57] lost anyway right
[59:01] but see then we were able to come along
[59:02] and get some
[59:03] quotes to where he says that that's upon
[59:06] your spirit All right that satisfied a
[59:10] lot But to just understand that was not
[59:13] the satisfaction that I needed because
[59:16] remember I'm supposed to be a
[59:19] minister and I'm supposed to try to
[59:22] answer your questions and your thoughts
[59:24] to help you All right the husbandman
[59:28] must be first partaker of the fruit So
[59:30] then I try to understand something
[59:34] before I preach on it As brother
[59:36] Brandham said he said "I I would not
[59:39] preach on what was it hell that time."
[59:41] He said "I wouldn't preach on it for a
[59:42] long time I forgot how many years." He
[59:44] said "Because I didn't understand it."
[59:47] All right I was in the message in
[59:52] 1967 And it was 1973 that I finally got
[59:56] around to preach on on uh Daniel 70
[59:59] weeks cuz I didn't understand it But
[1:00:02] then when I got it to the basis that I
[1:00:04] could understand it I know cuz brother
[1:00:06] Mo was a pastor and I would not preach
[1:00:08] anything contrary to him and he knew I
[1:00:11] was studying on it and he said "Preach
[1:00:12] it." I said "No what if it's contrary to
[1:00:14] you?" I said "I won't do it because I
[1:00:17] said that that would be wrong I I may be
[1:00:20] your assistant but you're the pastor Cuz
[1:00:22] I've honored that Always have All right
[1:00:26] And uh so he said it like this and he
[1:00:28] got up in the pulpit and he said
[1:00:29] "Brother Dale is going to preach on
[1:00:31] Daniel 70 weeks." And said "We'll listen
[1:00:34] to him and wait and see what he's
[1:00:36] got." And said "When it's finished then
[1:00:39] we'll decide whether the thoughts are
[1:00:41] right or whatever it is." And I
[1:00:43] appreciated that because he left it open
[1:00:45] and I could speak what I believed All
[1:00:47] right
[1:00:48] And see then that way you know because
[1:00:51] I'm not I'm not going to be
[1:00:53] contrary That's why I've tried to my
[1:00:55] best to tell these ministers I've had a
[1:00:58] couple of situations that problem I said
[1:01:01] don't get in the pull pit and preach
[1:01:03] something contrary to what I preach
[1:01:06] until you first tell
[1:01:09] me and then when you tell me I'll decide
[1:01:12] whether or not you can go to the
[1:01:14] you know before the ser I said "You
[1:01:16] ought to have that much respect I would
[1:01:18] respect you."
[1:01:21] Or I'd get out and leave one because
[1:01:24] that's just I think that's the way we
[1:01:26] ought to be
[1:01:28] You know we ought to honor the
[1:01:31] things and see then that wouldn't
[1:01:33] wouldn't be no problem because if Wade
[1:01:35] come to me today and he said "Daddy I'm
[1:01:37] I I believe something contrary to you."
[1:01:39] I'd say "All right let's sit down and
[1:01:41] talk about it." If I seen it was worthy
[1:01:43] you know what I'd do and say the pull
[1:01:45] pit's yours to explain it But I would
[1:01:47] explain to the congregation Wade is
[1:01:49] going to preach something that is
[1:01:51] contrary to me of what I believe But I
[1:01:54] want you to listen to him very sincerely
[1:01:56] and I will be too And let's let the Holy
[1:01:59] Spirit decide
[1:02:01] of what it is
[1:02:03] You say "Would you do that to somebody?"
[1:02:06] I've done it before so I don't have to
[1:02:07] answer that
[1:02:09] question But now
[1:02:12] listen That Holy Spirit that
[1:02:16] irrigates that word you held in your
[1:02:20] soul does more than just make it
[1:02:24] alive It seals that
[1:02:31] it seals that soul
[1:02:34] Brother R said now it's like a woman
[1:02:36] getting pregnant He said she can't get
[1:02:39] pregnant again cuz she's sealed up Right
[1:02:44] All
[1:02:45] right And see then that's what it ought
[1:02:47] to be We ought to look at the new birth
[1:02:49] as to
[1:02:50] see and then when somebody comes along
[1:02:53] with something different just check it
[1:02:56] out with that new birth that you have
[1:03:00] and see if it'll go from here through
[1:03:03] here and out here
[1:03:09] There's some of them you know what I'm
[1:03:10] talking about
[1:03:12] There's some of them think that the
[1:03:14] great revelation when you get up here
[1:03:16] that polygamy is
[1:03:19] okay Now that's in the message people Oh
[1:03:22] yeah
[1:03:25] Even a good Baptist wouldn't believe it
[1:03:26] that way
[1:03:28] He just kind of bypass it and goes on
[1:03:30] forgets it At least some of them are
[1:03:32] still fighting against those things All
[1:03:35] right But
[1:03:39] listen see then you are
[1:03:43] sealed let me I didn't give him this but
[1:03:46] let me I was just sitting there thinking
[1:03:48] about
[1:03:49] it and uh look what brother Brandham
[1:03:53] says on the message called what shall I
[1:03:54] do with Jesus called to
[1:03:57] Christ preaching 63 11:24 that morning
[1:04:01] service paragraph 104 now the Holy
[1:04:04] Spirit is the
[1:04:08] God is not three He's the same God in
[1:04:12] three
[1:04:13] dispensations I want you Same God in
[1:04:16] three
[1:04:17] dispensations All right Three offices
[1:04:20] God the Father over the law God the Son
[1:04:25] in grace and God the Holy Ghost as you
[1:04:28] call Pulled it
[1:04:30] up And look what he says
[1:04:36] God the Father was the word That's where
[1:04:39] we got down to
[1:04:40] reading God the Son was the
[1:04:44] word God the Holy Ghost is the word
[1:04:51] Remember it's the same God Three
[1:04:52] disciplines say not three different gods
[1:04:54] Oh we want to make it father son and
[1:04:56] holy
[1:04:57] ghost It's father son holy ghost is the
[1:05:00] same God all the way All right Watch
[1:05:02] what he says
[1:05:03] It's just three offices and and the Holy
[1:05:07] Ghost seals
[1:05:08] you Therefore you're sealed by the word
[1:05:18] The new birth is a birth of the word And
[1:05:21] that's what seals
[1:05:24] you
[1:05:25] right seals you in
[1:05:29] Christ Think about it
[1:05:32] being sealed by the word
[1:05:36] Do you know what that merely means if
[1:05:38] you think about it it means you can't
[1:05:40] pregnantate that thing any different now
[1:05:44] I mean can somebody come along now and
[1:05:46] tell you the trinity is is
[1:05:48] right Come on Can they deprogram you and
[1:05:52] put you somewhere and give you a
[1:05:54] million-dollar airplane to fly the
[1:05:56] country with to get you to preach their
[1:05:58] doctrine and to try to tell the world
[1:06:00] that you was wrong in trying to believe
[1:06:02] the prophet's
[1:06:05] message come on Don't tell me you got
[1:06:08] the Holy Ghost Forget all that junk
[1:06:12] All right
[1:06:15] See
[1:06:17] then you're
[1:06:19] sealed by the Holy
[1:06:24] Spirit And the Holy Spirit is that seal
[1:06:29] upon the
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:31] word that you've taken
[1:06:35] and you believe it That's what the
[1:06:38] disciples said We don't know where to go
[1:06:40] Thou has the words of eternal life Where
[1:06:42] can we go that's right you know we don't
[1:06:44] have nowhere to go We don't know what's
[1:06:46] going on We certainly don't know what's
[1:06:48] happening but we ain't going to go
[1:06:50] nowhere else
[1:06:52] He said "You're just in good shape." Now
[1:06:54] go up to the upper room sit up there and
[1:06:55] wait a while Now you remember what
[1:06:56] Brother Brham emphasized that He said
[1:06:59] one of them said one day he said "Let's
[1:07:01] just take it by
[1:07:03] faith We've got the gifts We've seen the
[1:07:06] dead raised We've seen all of these
[1:07:07] things Let's just go by faith."
[1:07:11] That's a good thing ain't it oh glory
[1:07:14] Hallelujah We've got it by faith
[1:07:19] It's all right if it's real
[1:07:25] But what about
[1:07:26] now the new
[1:07:29] birth being the
[1:07:31] revelation of Jesus
[1:07:34] Christ personally to you
[1:07:41] the word that was revealed to
[1:07:44] you see the alive word seals you into
[1:07:48] the body Would you want to read that
[1:07:51] they can surely pull it up in a hurry
[1:07:53] Paragraph 233 and 234 of Christ is a
[1:07:57] mystery of God revealed because that's
[1:07:59] what we were on last week
[1:08:04] Go to paragraph 240 and he says the new
[1:08:06] birth is a
[1:08:11] revelation Remember on Patmas vision
[1:08:13] paragraph 71 1960
[1:08:17] 1204 you can't be saved until it's
[1:08:20] revealed to
[1:08:25] you You're only saved by
[1:08:29] revelation
[1:08:33] Remember in the message called the
[1:08:38] rapture paragraph
[1:08:42] 66 that a revelation is faith
[1:08:46] So he can only be born again by
[1:08:50] faith Faith is a revelation
[1:08:53] You can only be born again by revelation
[1:08:56] We'll pick this up in the next message
[1:08:57] and drop back over on it because the
[1:09:00] last one they can pull that one up which
[1:09:02] is paragraph 28 Earnestly contending for
[1:09:05] the faith Number five
[1:09:10] brothers a personal
[1:09:14] experience Have you had a personal
[1:09:16] experience and
[1:09:18] watch There's quite a difference in me
[1:09:21] having an intellectual faith than a
[1:09:24] divine faith
[1:09:25] That's where you my Baptist friends fail
[1:09:27] to go on You get the intellectual faith
[1:09:30] by that But it must be a divine
[1:09:33] revelation of Jesus Christ to you that
[1:09:36] just came out of the
[1:09:40] heart All right Am I still with the
[1:09:43] thought are you with
[1:09:45] it where's the intellectual faith
[1:09:51] where's divine faith heart What's heart
[1:09:54] oh
[1:09:56] what happened in the garden satan took
[1:09:59] the what the head God took the heart
[1:10:05] Right Okay The in effect in intellectual
[1:10:08] faith is not enough That's all right But
[1:10:12] it only brings you to the Holy Spirit
[1:10:18] The Holy Spirit is a personal
[1:10:20] experience of the birth the new birth
[1:10:25] regeneration making a new creature in
[1:10:28] Christ
[1:10:30] All
[1:10:35] right has it been revealed to you that
[1:10:37] you're born again
[1:10:43] will what ever came to you as your
[1:10:45] thoughts about a new
[1:10:48] birth will it compare with the rest of
[1:10:50] the
[1:10:57] word you know the Bible don't say he
[1:11:00] that
[1:11:01] believes I knew that in the Baptist
[1:11:03] church and used to talk to them a little
[1:11:05] bit about it The Bible said "He that
[1:11:07] believeth," which is a
[1:11:10] continuation if you stop believing then
[1:11:12] there's something wrong with you
[1:11:13] believing
[1:11:16] Right
[1:11:17] but he that believeth and is
[1:11:20] baptized The Bible says "Being born
[1:11:24] again?" By the what by the incorruptible
[1:11:28] word of God that liveth and abideth
[1:11:31] forever Amen
[1:11:39] Have you have you ever asked God to
[1:11:41] reveal to you the new birth
[1:11:47] no I'm not going to do that brother Dale
[1:11:50] Cuz that mean to say I didn't believe I
[1:11:51] already had
[1:11:55] it And you did you finally get what I've
[1:11:57] been preaching the whole day cuz that's
[1:11:59] the point the whole day right okay Is
[1:12:01] that the you know that's the whole point
[1:12:03] of the whole message is is is to try to
[1:12:06] get us away from that intellectual faith
[1:12:14] See now intellectual faith will deny the
[1:12:17] word somewhere
[1:12:20] It has to to be intellectual faith It
[1:12:22] can't Intellectual faith can't bring the
[1:12:24] word word by word
[1:12:28] But divine revelation can fit all the
[1:12:31] way And remember my point to start with
[1:12:34] is whatever you started with to get the
[1:12:36] new birth is the same thing that's going
[1:12:39] to take you on to the change of the body
[1:12:45] Amen To take you out of here And then
[1:12:47] you want you know what you can say then
[1:12:49] hey we'll be going up in the air and you
[1:12:52] can look over at me and you can say
[1:12:53] "Brother Dale thank you Because you
[1:12:56] tried to explain this to us didn't you?"
[1:12:58] Said "Cuz you know what now I know I've
[1:13:00] got the new birth."
[1:13:03] Because I've just changed and we're
[1:13:04] heading out of here
[1:13:06] You say "Thank you." Well it may take
[1:13:09] till then before you get over your petty
[1:13:11] feelings about me and hurt little
[1:13:13] feelings about something that I try to
[1:13:14] say to you you know but that's all right
[1:13:17] when we get up there we don't have to
[1:13:18] worry about none of that That's right
[1:13:21] But I want to express one more time and
[1:13:22] then I'll do it again Lord willing next
[1:13:25] Sunday
[1:13:27] One more
[1:13:29] thing You're not born again your body
[1:13:31] You're not born again in your body
[1:13:32] You're not born again in your spirit
[1:13:34] You're born again in your soul
[1:13:36] Justification sanctification baptism of
[1:13:38] holy takes place in the soul The soul
[1:13:40] the new birth is a birth of the word The
[1:13:42] word you've heard you took it you held
[1:13:43] it and hold on to it Holy Spirit comes
[1:13:45] and quickens it uh seals you into the
[1:13:49] kingdom All right Then does the Holy
[1:13:52] Spirit have to come into your soul for
[1:13:53] you to think that you're saved as the
[1:13:56] prophet would say you and God are
[1:13:58] together in persons Does that mean
[1:13:59] there's two people standing inside of
[1:14:05] me why can't you just simply say it like
[1:14:07] this that God came down and made alive
[1:14:10] the word that he had given me That's
[1:14:11] right And that makes you and him as one
[1:14:14] together Amen Why can't you believe it
[1:14:17] that way amen Well you're doing away
[1:14:19] with the I done away with the Holy
[1:14:21] Spirit I still believe the Holy Spirit
[1:14:22] has to come down That's right I I me am
[1:14:26] still looking this headstone when it
[1:14:28] unites for the body May I quote the
[1:14:31] prophet that will come such a baptism of
[1:14:34] the Holy Ghost that it'll fill every
[1:14:37] fiber of your being and take in the
[1:14:41] rapture Sir is that what he said
[1:14:44] so Brother Dale are you still looking
[1:14:46] for the baptism i'm looking every day
[1:14:53] But I know one thing for certain If the
[1:14:56] word ain't right why do you think we've
[1:14:57] been here 40 something years you don't
[1:15:00] never think that way That means
[1:15:02] something's wrong with what we've got
[1:15:03] planted That's right
[1:15:06] We planted our own ideas
[1:15:12] the prophet brought the word unto us
[1:15:14] pure and unadulterated He said
[1:15:19] and that's where a lot of people say
[1:15:20] well I believe him after the seals broke
[1:15:22] I don't believe him before the seals
[1:15:23] broke Well now before the seals broke
[1:15:25] was when he said and spoken word the
[1:15:27] seed that the word had been pronulated
[1:15:33] See the word that was in this
[1:15:36] Bible
[1:15:38] 1962 You read spoken words read no seed
[1:15:41] over and over and you'll finally one day
[1:15:43] realize he's talking about the word pure
[1:15:47] and unadulterated was exactly the way
[1:15:50] the disciples brought it He said "How
[1:15:52] many gods they have?" One How many gods
[1:15:55] the bride have one
[1:15:57] But those seals and things were things
[1:15:59] that never been spoken on
[1:16:02] And that was his message
[1:16:06] to be brought So the Holy Spirit comes
[1:16:09] down upon you as a baptism Don't ever
[1:16:12] say that brother Dale says that he
[1:16:13] doesn't believe in the baptism of the
[1:16:15] Holy Ghost You're you're a
[1:16:19] lying because I believe in it I've
[1:16:22] witnessed them I don't have to worry
[1:16:24] about it
[1:16:29] But I try to explain it to you and I
[1:16:31] know it's hard for the human mind to
[1:16:34] have always been taught well we going to
[1:16:35] get the baptism We got the baptism We
[1:16:36] got the baptism It's everybody with the
[1:16:38] baptism Baptism
[1:16:39] Baptism Then you ask them about the
[1:16:41] baptism Well well the baptism is
[1:16:42] speaking in tong shouting
[1:16:45] glory I don't believe that Now I don't
[1:16:49] believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:51] shouting speaking in tongues Do I
[1:16:53] believe the baptism is the birth and I
[1:16:56] believe you are doing a lot to do with
[1:16:57] that crying and speaking in tongues and
[1:17:02] thing is working out through your body
[1:17:08] Okay So
[1:17:09] now take you to the three
[1:17:13] circles The Holy Spirit can anoint your
[1:17:16] body do great
[1:17:18] things He can anoint your spirit do
[1:17:21] great wonderful things
[1:17:24] But does he anoint the soul or does he
[1:17:26] seal the
[1:17:28] soul does he irrigate the soul does he
[1:17:31] give birth to the
[1:17:34] soul those are words maybe we'd not
[1:17:37] place within our vocabulary about it
[1:17:39] We've only used the
[1:17:42] baptism But see you can't tie together
[1:17:44] then the rest of the prophet's
[1:17:48] message And when he gets over on the I'm
[1:17:51] pretty sure it's right at the last of
[1:17:52] the seventh
[1:17:54] seal he said go on with the same simple
[1:17:57] message He said because you don't said
[1:18:00] you'll work yourself away I'm
[1:18:01] paraphrasing but it's pretty
[1:18:04] close He said you'll work yourself away
[1:18:07] from
[1:18:09] it In other words let God lead us and go
[1:18:15] on Right
[1:18:17] now let me illustrate it in one more way
[1:18:20] I'll take this up next service again so
[1:18:23] it won't work
[1:18:28] Did Luther have the new birth
[1:18:36] i thought the
[1:18:39] prophet emphasized and done a whole
[1:18:43] message in the church age book on it's
[1:18:45] called the Holy Ghost and ever
[1:18:50] age and I thought he brought it out that
[1:18:53] the Holy Ghost has been in ever
[1:18:56] age and I I think and can believe that
[1:18:59] he's talking about the new birth in
[1:19:01] every
[1:19:01] age Because may I quote the scripture to
[1:19:07] you if Luther didn't get the word
[1:19:10] planted as Jesus
[1:19:13] spoke and held the word as Jesus spoke
[1:19:16] and the Holy Ghost come and quickened
[1:19:18] that to Luther then there was no way he
[1:19:20] could have the new birth
[1:19:23] Are you going to leave him out of this
[1:19:27] then you're going to say it's not the
[1:19:29] Holy Ghost in our age See where our
[1:19:31] trouble is is a lot of the quotes
[1:19:33] brother Brandham is referring to there
[1:19:36] will be things that he says in there
[1:19:38] that it seems like that this age don't
[1:19:42] have it this age does have it and this
[1:19:45] age gets a little more of
[1:19:48] it
[1:19:51] Well maybe this will explain to you what
[1:19:53] I'm thinking about
[1:19:57] Martin
[1:20:00] Luther was a
[1:20:03] Catholic and he believed in his
[1:20:07] Catholicism that that was his
[1:20:14] birth God come along and there was a lot
[1:20:17] of people protesting the Catholic Church
[1:20:20] before Martin Luther started
[1:20:25] I kind of believe Luther was kind of up
[1:20:26] in that ranks Don't you i don't believe
[1:20:28] he was just one of them fly by night
[1:20:30] sitting over there and kissing the
[1:20:31] pope's toe and popes towing Everything
[1:20:33] was okey dokie I think he was a human
[1:20:36] being was that God was beginning to deal
[1:20:38] with throughout his life That's me
[1:20:42] now And then God come down one day and
[1:20:47] says "The just shall live by faith."
[1:20:51] That was not his first contact with God
[1:20:53] as a a birth form or thoughts or ideas
[1:20:57] He was already a
[1:20:59] believer And here's where we miss the
[1:21:04] prophet He'll say the birth of the
[1:21:12] age Luther's age was the age of
[1:21:15] justification
[1:21:18] But he as an individual had the new
[1:21:20] birth
[1:21:22] You can argue and try to decree all you
[1:21:25] want to and fuss up and down about it
[1:21:28] that Luther didn't have it like we have
[1:21:30] it The quotes are there that brother
[1:21:32] Random said he didn't have it in
[1:21:34] the magnitude or something to the order
[1:21:38] that we have it today But you know what
[1:21:41] he got it If he wasn't born again he's
[1:21:43] not in the body of Christ All right so
[1:21:46] you're going to leave a gap in your
[1:21:47] pyramid You know you're going to you're
[1:21:49] really smart You got it all figured
[1:21:52] out It wasn't long until a man came
[1:21:55] along by the name of John
[1:21:57] Wesley You know that John Wesley
[1:22:00] believed in the new
[1:22:02] birth of
[1:22:09] justification He thought he was saved He
[1:22:12] was already a preacher He was a
[1:22:14] missionary on his way to
[1:22:17] America and he received the message of
[1:22:20] sanctification from the moral or how you
[1:22:23] pronounce the
[1:22:27] word But yet they didn't do with that
[1:22:29] message that what Wesley did So it
[1:22:33] became the
[1:22:34] age of
[1:22:36] sanctification Not that Wesley wasn't
[1:22:39] born again
[1:22:46] If he hadn't been born again he wouldn't
[1:22:47] have come to the truth of it
[1:22:50] Okay wasn't long after then a group of
[1:22:52] people called Isusa Street
[1:22:57] Pentecost You got in there with those
[1:22:59] pilgrim holiness Listen to Prophet the
[1:23:00] other day He says "Oh good old
[1:23:02] sanctified Methodist." He said "That's
[1:23:05] all they were." Talking about your
[1:23:07] pilgrim holiness and your your
[1:23:08] congregational holy everyone He put them
[1:23:10] all in there where he's at You know that
[1:23:12] he said "Good old sanctified
[1:23:16] Methodist." You know a lot of them
[1:23:18] turned down the gifts and the things
[1:23:20] right but you know
[1:23:23] what the oneeyed black man on Isusa
[1:23:26] Street was not the first one to speaking
[1:23:29] in tongues and trying to get the gifts
[1:23:30] moving etc etc They already were a lot
[1:23:33] of people doing that but he was the one
[1:23:37] that struck in the age
[1:23:39] of the gifts and the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:43] Ghost Now here's where the people of the
[1:23:45] message even deny Brother Brandham calls
[1:23:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost on Isusa
[1:23:49] Street the same baptism in the book of
[1:23:52] Acts
[1:23:54] Now you tell me that ain't right I'll be
[1:23:57] glad to bring you the quotes
[1:24:00] He said I met people 50 years before I
[1:24:03] come along that had the same Holy Ghost
[1:24:05] that come on the day of
[1:24:07] Pentecost Amen
[1:24:10] But you see where the problem is they
[1:24:12] can't divide the day of Pentecost
[1:24:15] I know that's where I come along and I
[1:24:18] just stir up the whole
[1:24:20] deal because the 120 in the upper room
[1:24:23] had walked with Jesus for three and a
[1:24:24] half years And when the Holy Ghost fell
[1:24:26] on them it could bring them to right
[1:24:30] here where it says Holy Spirit not the
[1:24:32] headstone because your prophet said it
[1:24:33] hasn't come So forget it Right
[1:24:37] but that 3,000 born outside was born
[1:24:40] again right down here because they'd
[1:24:42] never heard the word and they was born
[1:24:43] again at
[1:24:45] faith So those on Isusa street was born
[1:24:48] again in faith 464 the old seal book
[1:24:51] Read
[1:24:53] it And under that when he says he calls
[1:24:58] street he said another great prophet
[1:25:04] Well well that's brother No he says then
[1:25:07] as all the other ages at the end of the
[1:25:09] age the messenger
[1:25:12] comes because the Holy Ghost come on
[1:25:15] Isusa street
[1:25:17] there is your prophet
[1:25:21] but it's the age of the word you're
[1:25:24] talking about Amen Brother Brandham
[1:25:26] swallow this Let's see Brother Brandham
[1:25:29] then was born again under the Isusa
[1:25:32] Street Pentecostal baptism of the Holy
[1:25:35] Ghost
[1:25:39] Now come on You tell me anything
[1:25:41] different I'm subject to
[1:25:44] listening But where you going to put
[1:25:47] it he received the Holy Ghost way back
[1:25:50] in his early time life
[1:25:52] It was the same Holy Ghost that come on
[1:25:54] day at
[1:25:59] Pentecost Now then what
[1:26:03] happened then the message
[1:26:06] came and you want to quote like in
[1:26:09] rapture etc where he says the message
[1:26:12] began in the
[1:26:14] seals not in the years of preparation
[1:26:18] Brother Random's message was not from
[1:26:20] from 47 to 62 That was restoring of the
[1:26:24] faith back to the original Pentecostal
[1:26:27] fathers that was in this Bible Then his
[1:26:30] message came If you want the quotes I'd
[1:26:32] be glad to give them to you where the
[1:26:35] message started with the opening of
[1:26:37] those seals
[1:26:44] Now in the days of
[1:26:47] Luther the man and the message man and
[1:26:50] the age became
[1:26:52] one Age of justification Luther come
[1:26:55] right in there with it You know what for
[1:26:58] you to not believe Luther's message You
[1:27:00] was not in the age of Luther and you was
[1:27:03] not in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:05] Luther had
[1:27:10] move it on up to
[1:27:14] Wesley Move it up to Wesley Wesley and
[1:27:18] message of sanctification became one
[1:27:21] because of the age of sanctification
[1:27:25] And for you to deny
[1:27:27] Wesley's message became Luther's
[1:27:31] message Where did it leave
[1:27:35] you you were not in the age of
[1:27:39] Wesley I ain't going to say they
[1:27:41] wouldn't saved Ain't got nothing to do
[1:27:42] with it Trying to express something When
[1:27:45] you come to Isusa Street the Holy Ghost
[1:27:49] and those people became one
[1:27:54] For you to stay in the age of
[1:27:56] sanctification and refuse to go on am I
[1:27:59] quoting the prophet you denominate and
[1:28:02] die
[1:28:04] But those who came on was not just
[1:28:09] gifts Do you realize on Isusa Street
[1:28:11] that they were trinitarians
[1:28:14] you realize before brother Random ever
[1:28:15] started in about 1914 111 or somewhere
[1:28:19] in there that Seymour and all of those
[1:28:21] brothers begin to preach on the oneness
[1:28:23] of the Godhead Brother Brandham wasn't
[1:28:25] the first one that preached on the
[1:28:27] oneness of the
[1:28:28] Godhead He he was the first one got it
[1:28:30] straight and right Yeah I agree there
[1:28:32] Now we'll hold on to that But they'd
[1:28:35] even started baptizing in the name of
[1:28:38] the Lord Jesus Christ before Brother
[1:28:39] Brandom ever started
[1:28:48] What's your point brother
[1:28:54] Dale brother Brandham and his message
[1:28:56] become
[1:28:58] one He had the new
[1:29:01] birth He come with his
[1:29:09] message Somebody
[1:29:14] Can you say as I quoted this morning the
[1:29:17] new birth or message of the
[1:29:22] age you see if we stay in Isusa Street
[1:29:26] and won't go on to the message that
[1:29:29] Brother Brandham brought we can prove
[1:29:32] that we're lost
[1:29:37] You know somebody's got to give birth to
[1:29:39] this message Right The world wasn't
[1:29:42] concerned The pope didn't get upset when
[1:29:44] Martin Luther protested the Catholic
[1:29:46] Church He didn't get no problems He
[1:29:49] didn't go haywire and have all kind of
[1:29:51] headaches And I when he posted that
[1:29:54] thesis on the door it was when the
[1:29:57] people begin to follow Luther's message
[1:30:02] the devil got concerned When the people
[1:30:05] started believing Wesley's message he
[1:30:07] the devil got concerned When they
[1:30:10] started believing the Zeus Street
[1:30:11] message the devil got
[1:30:14] concerned If you want to see the devil
[1:30:16] get upset just start believing this
[1:30:17] message
[1:30:19] Amen
[1:30:22] Get away from all the fanaticism
[1:30:26] all of these two souls seven thunder
[1:30:28] virtues peruses son of man all of that
[1:30:30] polygamies and biggamies and higgamies
[1:30:32] and whatever thing
[1:30:35] and start believing the prophet's
[1:30:37] message The devil will get upset at you
[1:30:42] So if you want the devil upset at you
[1:30:44] just start believing the message Now if
[1:30:45] you don't want the devil upset at you
[1:30:46] just just sit there in your little seats
[1:30:48] and be happy
[1:30:51] But remember you're going by the grave
[1:30:54] That's right
[1:30:56] Right
[1:30:58] Would you believe it if I read something
[1:30:59] to
[1:31:00] you let's see if I can find
[1:31:06] it Come ahead
[1:31:10] brothers Come ahead
[1:31:15] musicians Oh yeah There's a man here
[1:31:18] that can turn on the lights Paragraph
[1:31:21] 187 pre 63
[1:31:24] 1229 Justification served its
[1:31:28] time in justification under
[1:31:31] Luther Then it had to become
[1:31:33] sanctification through
[1:31:36] Wesley And sanctification served its
[1:31:39] time till it become the baptism of the
[1:31:43] Holy
[1:31:44] Ghost And the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:48] served its time until the Holy Spirit
[1:31:52] which there's only one God blends into
[1:31:55] the
[1:31:57] church and the church into Christ And it
[1:32:00] makes Jesus Christ reflected on earth
[1:32:03] what he promised here in the
[1:32:06] Bible Might not believe it I can't make
[1:32:10] you do that I'm only responsible for the
[1:32:14] word
[1:32:17] That's what your prophet had to
[1:32:20] say Folks you can see why did I feel
[1:32:24] so But in 1969 trying to preach to a
[1:32:27] group of
[1:32:30] people that the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:33] quoting from the prophet would be the
[1:32:35] son of man in the last
[1:32:40] days No that's just brother Brandham Go
[1:32:43] ahead
[1:32:45] We will remind you that we're reading in
[1:32:48] Revelations 5 of Revelations 1 And this
[1:32:51] one in Revelations 1 Brother Brandham
[1:32:53] said is the
[1:32:55] bride And it says in the midst of the
[1:32:57] seven golden counts kind of one like
[1:33:00] unto the son of
[1:33:04] man That's the bride
[1:33:07] That's God in bride form

[1:33:13] got let's do four in the red book
