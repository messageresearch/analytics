========================================

oh hey um pray for me my throat is a little scratchy but this has been requested by several people from here so hope someone gets a blessing when i come to your presence the vastness of your worry beauty oh when i come into your presence the wonder of your lovers me oh oh oh i want to see i want to see i want to see shining in the light of your holy during what we've been reading from revelations 1 1-3 we use this scripture every time and then we go on speaking on the study of the book of revelations this will be part five so we i don't reckon there's any announcements to be made it's not already made we had an opportunity today to go up and to see uh ricky peterson there they've got him in jail and uh it doesn't look good for him because he's facing some time on some accounts you know but uh we just pray that the lord would make it work out because he'd already done some things and all because he you know they had him in in lockup and uh when nobody's supposed to be able to see him and and everybody was trying to but nobody couldn't get in but the lord had a way of working it out and i was able to go in today and be able to talk to him and and they said that that wasn't supposed to be in but lord knows how to work everything out and take care of it we give him all the glory and the honor and everything for all the whole thing because he'll work out things for him and all and i just told him you know to try to be as best as he could and we'd do all we could and nobody couldn't get in to see him you know they're nothing until they make their final hearings and all of the different things on it so just pray for him lord bless him and uh take care of him and maybe they'll break the sentence down from what they were talking about and that's the main thing is to get him into that position so you just pray for him he needs your prayer that's the last thing he said today just tell the church to pray for me and i said we'll certainly be doing that so you know may the lord touch him and all my cat all right revelations 1 heavenly father we thank you lord for your loving grace unto us we thank you for you we pray that you would just bless us now with your understanding and your presence and your love lord let your light shine in each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins cleanse us lord from all unrighteousness and we just ask you lord to god each one of us be with but brother rick there lordly got him there in jail but you'll just have to be with him and take care of it you can work out a lot of things that we can't do anything about it but yet you can do a lot of things we committed into your hands believing you lord and just pray that you give him the right attitude and everything while he's tired lord may it be for his benefit because you said in your word all things work together for them that are they called you know we just believe that you you'll work it out have your way now if we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins because that's where we want to stand complete and all thanks lord have your way down god in jesus name amen revelations 1 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him is showing to his servants things which must shortly come to price and he sent in signified by his angel and to his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy what about just to be able to hear it as a blessing right and keep what about that now to be able to keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the lord had his blessing we know when we covered our uh sunday that the time is at hand and this is the time this is the time now that it's at hand you know time works to be revealed thank you brother you know so we we're looking forward to that because we believe it and know you know now we've been speaking on the book of revelations and this was a lead up to where we can get up to revelations 5 and all and i've told you that if you listen very carefully and apply the things that we talk about that you'll find out that when we get to revelations 5 it won't be a uh you know it will already be understood because we've already covered it but we just want to cover it you know up to that place and and all and you know to try to move on in the lord and uh you know i spoke on these things before but we have new ones with us and we too i wanted to lead up to that point to speak to you on revelations 5. so read that over and over read revelation 4 revelation 5 and just you know get familiar very much with the scriptures and the things to where we can see all right now we see that kind of just review up to where we are on the book of revelations that we see that your brother anderson can go ahead and pull up number one we read this the other day but it is not only look now the uncovering is not only the revelation this is page 13 church age book it's not only the revelation of the person of christ but it's the revelation of his future works in the oncoming seven church ages all right so then the book of revelation then is the bride's book amen it is written specifically to you and i haven't to worry that we can look down and see where we're at and you know he didn't leave us with just churchology amen and the writings of the apostles and things there and then you know it went down through the ages and just slipped away and and got into churchology and had to say those words that way but he didn't leave us that way he sent us a prophet in the end time to be able to understand and he began to speak on these things to to get us to understand the entire bible not just the book of revelation but now remember what a point i've been trying to make that you won't find in the book of revelations the lord jesus actually standing by himself you find him with the bride in the bride you could find him revealing himself to the bride because that's what he's doing to you and i and that that is it but it's not something to look at and i wanted you to read that one that that it's not just the revelation of jesus christ it's the revelation of his works or in other words what he's going to be doing all right now we went through revelations 1 and showing the symbolics and the things that we were speaking about and covering revelations 1 and it was the revelation that god give to jesus to give to john about what about the ages and the things right the ages had not transpired at the time but he you know he gave him the revelation to bring to john about the ages and the point i tried to make to you this i've always tried to make this point that if you can read revelations 1 then you can see how beautiful a picture that god has given of the bride before he ever even started writing any of the things that is in chapter two and three and see we read those things and we read the bad things about us you know the things we do and have done all right that's all right it should be done and covered to get out but the main thing is he shows how perfect we are before he ever started writing about the ages now i mean that to me is a wonderful statement that's really been a part of my life for many many many years because i spoke on this for i don't really know how long up into the at least the 30s or close to 40 years speaking on this point and it just doesn't it unfolds to me every day talking about it reading about it it's just that much greater you know to understand all right but now we come up to seeing that that we talked about the bride form and we talked about revelations uh 1 13 there you know where he's standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the son of man gerd about the pouts with a golden girdle and we saw that was the description of the lord jesus christ in his bride down through the ages now not just the first age or not just the last days that's right all right that's what we want to take the alpha and the omega yeah and try to make some great revelation and i've heard preachers even preach these alpha amigos nothing in between we brought around cities alpha and amigo and everything in between if he is the alpha and he is the mega that would have covered all in between that's right you know that wouldn't wouldn't be any problem but i've heard that preached on but now listen we saw him in bribe form down through the entire seven church ages one like unto the son of man and i hope you caught on to what i was saying earlier sunday that you would say well lutheran didn't understand those things no but they're part of it that's right right you're gonna say they're not part of the revelation well you just whacked your legs out under you that's right right right see if you say they don't have anything to do with it you just wiped yourself out because we had to have that for reformation right before you can talk a restoration that's right so then they're part of it and it was he was in the midst and miss means middles well how could you draw as i said sunday how could you draw the seven church ages and put him in the middle that would mean he's in the uh fourth church age he wouldn't be in the rest of it in fact you're a little wordy you know he's in the midst of the seven golden gate but it doesn't mean it like that he's not standing in the midst he's in all the church ages that way he's in the midst that's right all right you see that way we don't look at him for being something in one age and something else in another we look to the unveiling of the word that's right now what a wonderful thing to be able to say that we can before we would even start the ages then we can see what god has to say about us why would we worry then when the scripture would say be therefore perfect amen even as your father in heaven is perfect why would we be concerned we're trying to figure out how to cop to accomplish that right if if we are part of you know the bride then if you see any part of the bride you see the bride and if you see any part of the bride you see the groom that's the point i'm trying to make that's the thought i'm trying to get across to each and every one of us to look at and find ourselves in the book amen but i know where we come from i know the the thoughts we had we had thoughts like oh if i'd have just been back there in paul's age i could have seen myself well see this this is the greatest stage of amen right that's right it's more descriptive uh what is the word i guess descriptive more more describing of the bride of christ in the book of revelations than there is in all the rest of the bible put together right amen so where we can see ourselves and that's my whole point for us to see all right i told you i said i'm not going to speak on the church ages because you know the individual church age in revelation 2 and 3. we've covered those before and i didn't choose to speak on it because if we can look at revelations 1 we can see in revelations 1 what is in right that's correct revelations two and three amen all right right right and now get that point get get the thought of what i'm saying because that's the the entire thing of what i'm trying to get across to us and then you'll see revelations 5 and what it really is that's correct brother brother said this is the actual component of revelation 5 he said this is the actual opening of the seal right amen but are we still looking i put things in there once in a while for you to think on are we looking at a a seal or a book yeah come on you know remember the book of revelations has been symbolic amen are we looking it's something like that or are we trying to get what is being said right amen jot that one down yeah all right now so then i didn't choose to speak on revelations two and three of the individual ages because we already see sure we see the bride of jesus christ from revelations one god standing in her midst and she's like unto the son of man amen the girl is not down upon the waist part as the servant it's up on the shoulders or coming around and it talks about gird about the prouds the feminist description right amen see then if we're looking at it like that we can see ourselves there right and we're not trying to figure out some what does this mean or what does that mean right it's the very description of you that's right amen it's a picture of you and i right see we're going to talk about it we will get back to this later on another point but see the book of revelations is written in symbolics that's why it took a prophet you know symbols right symbols candlestick like a son of man right you know the different things it's written in symbols but we've had a prophet to tell us what those symbols are that's right all right amen now but are we tied up in trying to understand a symbol instead of seeing that the symbol is us i mean you know it's in us it's working in us what are we trying to do all right so we jump over two and three and we go over to chapter 4 and we'll pick that up and and read a little so this just jump over there and let's pick up chapter 4 and just look at this and see how beautiful it is now the lord willing sunday we will cover you know trying to get into the point of showing that the bride goes would cover it more the bride going up in revelation 4 1 and and not seen until 1921 and that's hard for people to comprehend that's right because they automatically would throw quotes they have at me even years ago when i first started uh in a meeting they were taking and handing me quotes you know of uh and say you know well the book of revelations is not in order you know i said well i i can't believe it is myself but i think it's kind of like the uh message i was thinking on the other day on the feast of the trumpets where there's so many statements in there that looks like they're so contrary until a big man in the message said you cannot understand the things to the trumpets i heard his words on national all right now the prophet of god i think i looked he saw said was talking three times i know it's in there one time about that book being thus saith the lord right and i think he covers three times does he have the lord throughout the book now a prophet saying it's thus saith the lord but see we're trying to figure it out you know we're trying to get it one two three four well brother dale that's what you do yes i'm glad you said that i do cover one two three and four but you may have get one here and two over here and three down here and four up there you know when you finality of getting it together because it go it goes that way all right but now look at revelations 4 1. as i said now don't be dealing too much with the thought of of of the you know the do it other than tonight we want to see what it says in the opening verses all right so look what it says after this now we'll read the minute where the prophet said eyes to the church agent correct all right after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven they got up on the screen and the first voice which i heard as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i'll show the things which must be here after all right let's just deal only there in the first parts of that revelations 4 1. after this after the church ages sometimes we'll get down to that more sunday but look what john he says and behold a door was opened in heaven amen now remember you're in symbols and in the symbol that's what john saw he looks up to heaven he sees a door open all right now but did he see a door open or did he see the door right which do you see what he said he saw a door was opened now so you're there in symbol see you see the the door all right now this is the question i want to ask you did john see an open door in heaven or did he see the one who is the open door now which did you see you said well we saw the open door that's the symbol right he saw a door that opened that's the problem but that was a symbol now you bring it back down to clarity of understanding or to find out what the symbol is and i just asked my own self a question who is the open door to heaven are we still looking well it was a door open if i could read that that's a symbol that's like a white horse riding off that's like a beast that's like a lamb with silent horns and seven eyes what did john see did he see a door all right right now come on be sensible with me all right he saw a door open he saw a door looked up our door open all right now john remembers a prophet he says okay now lord what am i looking at right he had been through the symbolic forms of revelations 1 and saw the things he had been through the the actual uh which is not in symbolics that's the reason i just said we believe it revelation two and three is really not symbolic it's fact it's telling you of the false mind and the true vine all right now so what did john see go ahead brother anderson pull up number two what did john see now this is revelation chapter four part the like part one out of it 1960 1231 paragraph 100 through 102. this door said in heaven that door when he looked up he saw the lord jesus no i mean the prophet's answering it right he's the one to interpret the symbolics right right so what did what did he see what did john see he saw the lord jesus just watch the following part of it that door the lord jesus no i looked and behold the door was open in heaven in the first voice which i heard was a voice of a trumpet now the scene is changing john's being been watching patmos you know one two or three and now he looks up what he sees something went on on earth here these church ages all down to the seven church ages and then after he got through seeing the church ages after that after the church ages has ceased he heard a voice he looked up towards heaven and he seen an open door and the first voice sounded like a trumpet all right seen change from patmos to heaven now think about that door though for a little bit before we get into the voice and we'll cover in a few minutes because you go back to revelation 3 8 in the church ages series and it covers the door and we know that jesus said i'm the door of the sheep folk right amen right so john saw jesus but he was in the symbol of a door an open door a way in right he was there and he was seeing those things you know then as i said he wasn't looking for the door he was wanting the understanding of who that door was because he knew it meant something right he already wrote if he'll be in the door in the church ages all right he already wrote the gospel of john that covers jesus as a door to the sheep folk all right so we're not looking at a door we're looking at the door amen the lord jesus himself showing himself see because we'll get to it in a minute it's got to be covered you know to the bases it'll come up with the bride of christ that's right all right but showing something had taken place the bride goes up in revelations 4 1. brother brown said john going there will read a minute is the type right of the rapture because when the church ages is over yeah see right then there comes a rapture all right but going up the bride okay now keep in mind then that we're talking about the lord jesus christ he's the door amen amen he's the only door there is to heaven right and the doors open now back in the old testament they might have thought about a door build a door tried to describe something by a door it was always closed see here the doors all open now quoting brother branham from the church i'm in the seal book he said they're selling seals but then he comes over and he says and the seals are open all right which means an opportunity to be revealed right now open door back in the church ages could represent like in the sixth church age would represent a missionary work that would be traveling about the world right the missionary right all right he actually said the open door was literally between the sixth church age and the seventh in the overlap and if you need that we have those quotes but you see it's a it's a revelation what is john seeing a revelation of jesus christ amen how did he now have that door and it's open then we're able to come in so pull it back up now we're going to the voice when i keep that in mind go back to paragraph 102. now we get to the voice and the voice was the same voice that walked into seven golden candlestick same voice the voice didn't change did we get down in a minute to where he says charlie the voice that called you and told you to turn around will one day call you until you come up amen me now you remember when we was in revelations 1 john turned to see the voice right he knew the voice and he was very familiar with the voice so then would it be any problem like the prophet said he he saw the lord jesus well because that was who he's expecting to see but he saw him as a descriptive form of an open door right right then a voice sounds out from inside the door right and what does it do see same voice the voice didn't change but the voice where was it when he heard it the first time listen where was it when he heard first down on earth i mean it remembers in the first church age behind him i was in the spirit of the lord's day that's revelation 1 10 there we just got through it through to verse 13. if you wanted to put it down i was in the spirit on the lord's day i heard behind the voices of a trumpet that sounded like many waters and my turn the looks in many waters with many preachers preaching down through the ages and i saw one standing in the midst of seven golden candlestick now after he showed him all that mystery of them seven golden candlesticks holding the stars and the white wig on and so forth and feet like bryce and eyes like fire the symbols then he heard the same voice once speaking from heaven and he looked up and he saw an open door oh an open door into heaven how do you get in by jesus christ that one door one way no other way so now what did john see an open door and a voice the voice that he'd heard on earth when he was walking with him and the voice that he heard in revelations one thing because the voice never changes that's right it's hard for me to call some most all of you and say hi how you doing you automatically so brother dale how are you why because you know my voice right you see john knew that voice that's right all right so it's no surprise when he hears the voice but the surprise always comes is like chapter one when he turned to see the voice he saw seven golden kettles did now he turns to see the voice it's an open door away to heaven we can't have a rapture unless you get away right you know all right so now that's what we're going to be dealing with it's called an open door see no other way amen all right go to number three all right revelations chapter 4 part 3 61 108 paragraph 71 and we find out after these things he heard a voice that was speaking to him that oh what was it the spirit left the earth all right after these things start out at the first chapter or the first verse after i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven revelation 4 1. after the church was gone then the door was open now don't get confused right now right it will take place to israel sure so don't get confused and hung on that part that he's saying this revelation that we receive to go into rapture we'll turn to israel when we go into rapture you agree amen so it will be there and we just keep it down here where we're at right all right so revelation 4 1 after the church was gone then the door was open and we went through that through all of that and found that that was christ was the door and the same voice that was walking in the midst of the seven golden candlestick also was the same voice he heard in heaven saying come up hither john went up it represented the church going in the rapture john went up in the spirit was taken away into heaven and for so i foresaw all the things that god promised and said to his disciples what is it to you if he cares till i come he saw the coming of the lord and what would take place he saw on earth what would take place on earth to the rapture of the church and was taken up to show plum on down even to a past the millennium oh isn't that wonderful now the voice and the door would have to be the same person right you agree the voice and the door is the same person right the only thing is signifying is is one is signifying the person the door to heaven the other is signifying his voice all right now the voice is the same it don't change all right so now watson come on down to the next one paragraph 125 related chapter 4 part 1 1960 1231. oh and john oh i know john being taken up immediately after the church age was the type of the raptured church immediately after the church age is over this lady of sin age then comes the rapture the church goes up like john did into the presence of god oh my that just winds my soul around caught up at caught up at the rapture of the church and it said this place the book of revelation was written see at the end of the church age all right now as i said don't get tied up with thinking in your mind when he'll say the bride goes up in revelations 4 1. because just remember that you and i are not up yet right okay but the book is unfolded right see we're not changed yet so when we're changing we'll go to israel this message will go straight to israel all right when we're changed all right and they'll tell them about us that made the change right but we're back here now and the rapture is out in front of us hopingly in the morning all right hopefully before the service is over but irregardless is still ahead of us right so here we are over here though and he told abraham he said can i withhold anything from abraham now what about a god that would thank so much of abraham that he showed the whole entire future that's right right sure amen what do you think about him with us is it not very easy for him to show us what will be if he's already as we covered in revelations 1 now he's already looked through and seen it and told us before he ever even started writing about it now we're talking about that we're here as mortal beings and god by that same voice is now describing the things that will be highest you know back under has been he is now and the future because that's what the seal is revealed that's right highest present in the future all right now so we get the entire revelation while we're still here amen seeing this that revelation now watch that revelation that you and i receive while we're here is what forms that open door amen that's right i don't know whether it'd be the correct way of saying it but that's the best way i know how to say it we're going to stand here on earth and hear a voice out of heaven we're not going to look up trying to try to find an open door right to see how big it is and just in case because some of us might be 400 pounds you know and we want to make sure it's a good 42 inch door or something i don't think i can make one that big but i know 36 is pretty big just making that is a point for you to think we're going to stand right here and see ourselves dire right or we're not going there now i'm talking about the ones that are changing among the twinkling of an eye that's correct right somebody's going to stand right here and see what john saw but you know what you're going to see when you look up there john looked up there and saw jesus come on when it unfolds correctly to you and i we will look up there and see jesus that's right all right but we'll see the form he's in he's in the ground right amen that's right right that's right see i i didn't finish up what i thought about the other day right for i just laid it down enough for us to get the point see what are we looking for well i don't see an open door up there you know okay i mean you think you got to have a key you think it's some kind of a locked door or whatever you know it's a revelation amen what john saw of god while he was on earth i'm talking about the lord jesus christ on the day of pentecost that began to be quickened unto him right right right and show you even things to come the scripture says so john was shown all the way even past the millennium see over the end of the future home all right and from right here now if the rapture took place today that would have to be three and a half plus a thousand so you know a thousand three and a half years so he saw a whole lot all right that's what i just think about it what was john looking at all right go to the next one all right revelations most of these are out of revelation chapter four just two or three parts of 61 0 101 paragraph 39 and we find that after these things after a minute that after the church ages can all cease then john was summons to come up higher come up higher which means come up here he showed him all that was going to happen in the world of the church age then after the church ages was over we find then that john was a type of every true believer that will be summoned by christ on high and what that's that right solomon's come up hither and we find out that the voice that spoke to him was the voice of a trumpet cleared distinctly and it was the same voice that spoke to him here on earth see as long as he was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he was speaking to or from listen and watch what he was doing as long as he was in the midst of the seven golden candlestick he was speaking to are from while i know we're speaking from the candlestick right the he was in the candlestick speaking from them to his church then when the church age had ceased he left the earth and moved up into heaven heavens and he called his redeemed up with him oh isn't that beautiful but it just makes your heart jump now he saw and heard the voice john was a type of ever true believer now i want you to think with me a little bit because this will help later now remember was john taken up literally in flesh to see these things in other words did he literally go up did he literally say did he really follow through i don't think so right around and when he went beyond the curtain of time his body was still laying on the bed that's right i don't think his body went there right and i don't think his soul went out of his body you know what i mean spirit or something went out of his body because that would that would mean he'd be deep it's just fine since but need no understanding he's indeed so as john did he literally go over and see this or did he raise up out of himself into a spiritual realm and the prophet of god said he was actually over the earth well john said he was in the spirit on the lord's day you know so he couldn't argue with him if he said john was you there he said i die so but john according to the records we have you were shackled to a tree on patmos and guards were standing around you i don't care what you think i was there he brought brown's body was laying on the bed not a dead body but he's in the spirit amen but now if you're listening you understand what i'm trying to get to so then john was the type of the rapture that will one day come come on yep john was a type of the rapture that will one day come into reality into you and i right now so he wasn't raptured up into the heavens bodily and everything you know no so now listen if brother branham could stay here in body and go there in a spiritual realm theophany whatever you want to call it and see all of these things and john could literally be on the isle of patmos maybe lay back under a tree you know like i said maybe shackled to a tree and a guard stand inside of him you know but yet he was there that's how real it was so now here's where the prophet comes in he said jesus is going to become visible among us not corporal now you'd say that because corporal body we we meet it in the air going towards it in the rapture right the corporal body don't come back to the millennium but the lord jesus can be so visible among us that he can raise the dead when going rapture that's right now remember how many years ago there was a message or a series i preached called matching pieces five ten years ago fifteen maybe nineteen 1995 wait can tell you because that was when he come back to the lord so all right that's been quite a few years and what i was talking about then was exactly what i'm talking about now that's right amen when we can stand here and see ourselves there ain't gonna be no problem to go that's right all right but you see that's what i've always tried to describe now you remember the point i've always made if i can't see it in my new birth i can't farm it all right no matter how good it sounds it just doesn't match up it's not in my new birth right because you see in my new birth i went into reap to a realm of reality that's right of eternity by the baptism of the holy ghost amen my soul yep my body and spirit is still here like brother branham's was laying on the base right like john was laying on patterns but the soul is eternal by the new birth now brother dean can remember when one day he was telling me how he had high blood pressure and most of you wouldn't know you know it was called a gondola which is a big old trash can all right general motors had these big trash cans up a little bit around with a big trash can to carry off the stuff that was called a gondola if i mispronounced that you just keep it right but it was a trash can i was standing there running a job that it took two people to run when i was ever out but yet i was still capable of talking to him and he said something about his blood pressure was running up i said well brother dean this is what you got to do i said can you stand here and that was probably what maybe 40 50 feet or maybe further down the line i don't know maybe a hundred feet away from where we were i said but you've got to believe that you're standing down there and not standing here he stood there a second he said i see what you're talking about okay so he takes off and he leaves he said i gotta go so he goes already thinking to go back to his work station and he decides to go have his blood pressure checked so he cuts up goes over the top comes back down to the thing and i'm working and you know done forgot about what we were we were talking about because i was really busy running the job but all at once i've become and most of you know i'm i've always been in my life a very strong person i've never never known when the man said that he'd never known weakness he was talking about spiritual weakness but until i was up from 70 years old i never knew witness and i still don't know as much as a lot of people at 50. that's right all right but all at once my knees i mean my legs were just me i was i was just having trouble i couldn't couldn't hardly even walk let alone run my job and i just and you know just so nervous and my legs are just weakened out i was just so weak and wrung out it was worse than if i worked all day or tried to run for a mile or whatever we used to do because until i was you know 30 years old we played basketball every night and stuff like that you know a 20-something year old in there and uh you know but i look down the line and i see him coming he was just barely touching the ground getting down there but he comes down and he said my blood pressure is perfect that's not i don't know what it is now with that illustration in mind can you see what i'm talking about john is here on patmos he had to be body spirit of soul there as a human being or he'd be dead brother branham was on debate laying there that's right are you actually coming back and seeing yourself moving that's right see but something happened in the spiritual realm of reality that he went beyond the curtain of time and saw the people there no john went beyond the curtain of time and he saw the future and what would happen to the church you know the pride can you understand that right amen he could be here and yet still be there because that's a revelation there is no there is no geographical um position um let me say i hope there's no condition existing or or you know a revelation is beyond all realities it what is the word supersedes which means goes well beyond any reality of anything natural the greatest you can think of natural it doesn't even start to think of the supernatural so now you can see what it's doing but now i'm asking the question because we're trying to drive us back down to revelation 4 1. had john not had the three and a half years or the tutoring of the word that's right and the baptism of the holy ghost that was given to him in the upper you know the upper room and placing him at the faith of the fathers right here where it says holy spirit right if he hadn't had that he would not have been capable of comprehending what was taking place now i believe every person damn you i've explained the split condition of the day of pentecost 120 nil per room heard the word for three and a half years was placed at brotherly kindness or in the words of the holy spirit on the pyramid but didn't have the headstone because it hadn't come yet that's your prophet but everybody born after them was born as a baby down in faith and he regardless if brother branham was a prophet he was born again at faith right he wasn't born again at the headstone right so then he had to be taught but had he not there in the ending of 62 coming into the 63 toward the opening of the seals had he not had the revelation of jesus christ that the apostles had right are you with me amen understanding the godhead and clarity perfect as the apostles had seen the seals couldn't open to the prophet and watch he may have went there in his early life of 58 or something maybe when he was transferred that don't have to do with it it was his revelation of jesus christ that took him beyond the curtain of time that's right that's right it is yours and my revelation of jesus christ that is going to take us out of this world that's why that i've been accused of just preaching and doing this or that or the other just just an old you know teacher and no spirituality about me or nothing but i'm still trying to pound the same thing right it's not my responsibility for it to be spiritual that's god's responsibility it's my responsibility to preach it to try to bring it to the people where god can reveal it but you see it's not going to do you any good to see john over there that's where the good numbers are i ain't saying with no good not you know but you understand what i mean ain't gonna change you to see john standing there ain't gonna change you to see brother around beyond the curtain of time and they're gonna take you beyond the curtain time right just because you say you see him there it's when you have the same experience to be able to go there and somebody's going to stand here and look down the under at the end of something and say i'm already over there that's right why can't we believe that amen i ain't gonna charge you for that because that was not in the message but i hope it will give you understanding of what we're talking about amen all right go ahead to the next one brother let's stay on this voice do we see it should be number six revelation chapter four part paragraph 149 150 going on through i think on to another paragraph there was a voice that called him all that voice oh i can't get away from that the voice of that one behind him then he looked around see it's almost an identical quote as the other one and he showed him all of the church ages because he was standing in the church ages the seven golden candlestick then he heard that voice after the church ages ceased that voice left the earth went up when he got into glory he heard him say come up here i'm going to show you what's going to happen from here after oh my now if john is taken up through the open door to show him all the future what would be the problem of us being able to stand here and from his description and the prophet's interpretation what would be the trouble of us standing here and seeing it eternal already so that way you're not waiting on something if you've got a revelation something you're not waiting on it may be 50 years later before it comes but you're not waiting on it because it's real to you right something's revealed to you it doesn't make no difference what's the time element that's irregardless all right so think on that that's hard for me to pull away from what i'm saying one go okay i'll try that voice let's speak on that voice a minute i got some scripture wrote down here now remember this is 1961. and brother branham didn't wait until 1965 or somewhere in there to where he began to preach about the the voice and the trumpet and the things he was already preaching it down through there and the rapture message he just summed it up into one thing and brought it right down to the point all right see let's pick oh i got some scriptures wrote down here let's go first and thessalonians forward just listen over here what this voice is going to say oh now what this voice is going to say now get the point he's on the voice that's calling up so let's see what this voice is going to say at thessalonians and what's being said in thessalonians got to be the same voice of what's being said above right follow me stay with me see oh we all know what it's going to say we all know what that voice is going to say don't we we know what's going to happen the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise is that right you who are putting it down in first thessalonians 4 16 17 the voice that voice was the voice of christ is that right the voice of christ all right coming over into the paragraphs what are you using the scripture the same voice that summoned john come up these using thessalonians he's using revelation the same voice are you listening it's not a different voice we've done read that he said it's a safe voice same voice that called you and told you to turn around from sin it's the same voice that's causing you through the church i mean through the statue of a perfect man to come up higher come up higher come up higher come up higher and the love of god when it unites with the bride of christ it'll be the same voice and the same voice that we hear we'll call it sound of the world the same voice that said to john come up is the same voice that summons the church someday amen trump is a jerk also the same voice that psalm and john to come up is the same voice that summons dead lazarus out of the grave i hope i pronounced it summons but i kept looking at that one i gotta get right out and say that don't even look good and that same voice of the archangel christ is the voice of the archangel voice of the archangel see all that trumpet voice of christ some and john to come up the same voice summon lazarus they remember in the message the rapture the same voice that raised lazarus is the same voice i'm going to call you did you notice it at the grave of lazarus he spoke with a loud voice not just said lazarus come forth lazarus come forth it summons him from the dead and he answered here am i and he come forth from the dead after he was dead and his body rotten than once the same voice said to john come up here i'll show you some things that's fixing to happen that same voice that shall sound when the dead in christ shall rise for the trumpet the trumpet what is the trump it's the voice of christ okay the same one sounded and summoned him up he heard the voice like a trumpet sound and said come up hither see how the resurrection will be it will be in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that clear sounding voice and he'll summons the church calling come out of it that great summoning voice god helped me to hear it in it that day amen right that's right i think i've got two more so let's go ahead maybe three more let's go to the next one revelation chapter 4 part 2 61 101 i got 66. that's the same thing that takes place right here the church was taken up into heaven and john now is brought up with it as a type of the resurrected i mean he even brings resurrection upon it as we look as we took it last night and we find out that this same voice that summoned him to come to look him to look back on earth was the same voice that summons him to come up whoever christian every voice charlie that summons you the very voice charlie that summons you one day down there in kentucky to turn around is the same voice that'll summons you hello aren't you glad of that brother evans the voice that said turn around the same voice said come up oh my there what a summons what a reality clear distinct like a trumpet turn around serve me come up to where i am same voice same voice why would anybody be looking for another voice but yet to run to and fro in the land talk about the people of the message trying to find some body with some new thing or some new thought or some idea to try to change us i thought the resurrection was already inside of you man you see that i thought the change would be from the inside out that's right right question answer 64 they asked the prophet what will be the translation of the bride you suggest to change your glorified bodies built around your born-again experience so when you're born again at faith then you start growing in grace and knowledge faith virtual knowledge temperature godliness and one day it will turn out to be what the statue of a perfect man right inside of you and i am now if it was right that john could not write the book of revelation just remember now i quote it this way remember that no novice was a writer of the bible right there's that when i say that word right novice which means a child you know a young person uh no young person like that that baby in the gospel was allowed to write the word it took those who were seasoned in the gospel to be able to write the word all right then it would take those seasoned in the gospel to be able to comprehend what it would be what was being said so if john could not have been able to go to patmos unless it was linked to his revelation see he had to know who that door was that's why when he looked up he didn't get all shook up and just standing there looking at the door and he said oh door don't knock no no what's the goal for now what we need we need jacob's letter yeah yeah because we got to climb up to there well that might have been a good problem but see he didn't see it that way when he saw the door he knew exactly who that was it was the lord jesus christ and he heard his voice and remember it's the voice also of many waters many people same voice the voices in the bright room is in the bride am i right you remember what we read earlier today phoenix enough the bride under her messenger will be the final voice to the final at eve that's right so if you get anything now from god you're going to have to come through the bride right amen i believe that there was a time maybe that god could bypass and do things but i believe it's closing the door pretty fast don't you we ain't got nothing to do with opening we kind of deal with closing it but it's one of these days it will be closed it won't be our fault it closed or or didn't close he's the one that's going to do it right but listen church that ain't got a thing to do with us what somebody else does right amen what a lot of these churches in the mexicans doing and the way they're running nothing to do with you and i that's true none whatsoever i'm not preaching out there anybody on the internet i'm not your pastor this is just out there if you want to listen but if you claim this your pastor and son does well all right then listen to what i'm saying john saw jesus now brother brown said when you begin to see the word you need this one he said you'll be seeing jesus sure when the word begins to be unfolded to you and i not just looking at it on page but when it begins to be revealed and made known in our hearts and lives i thought we believed the rapture was already in process right that's right inside of us and you know then the lord will show us something you know what he actually does when he shows you something sister gayle when he was there in the kitchen and he showed you one god do you know that that goes from here to beyond the mortals realms of life out into an eternal what would you call it habitation or position or placing a reality of eternity has struck us just for a second and that's all it is i remember one time when i've told you about it i'm not making light of the man but he was telling how he went fishing city he's going through over here he kept fishing over here and said the lord should fish over there and he's the normal fish over here and he's going to fish over there he's almost fishing over here so it alone our argument you know between him and the lord were to fish but he didn't finally didn't catch that finally throwing the hole caught a bunch of fish or a bigger you know but the lord they never dealt with me that way it's always a split second and it's probably less than a split second right you know i i like that for the twinkling of an eye yeah you know i ain't never figured that out yet and everybody trying to explain what it is and the bat and the twinkling of this or something but a revelation takes you into eternity and just for whatever time that is that's right i've come here and you've seen me do it tell you the lord spoke to me about something preached three four five months before it ever got to the point that he really told me you know why because it's all in the word see an open door is a revelation of the supreme deity go ahead and roll those up brother and we'll just read them off and then we'll get through it see what an open door really is this is from the philadelphian church age 1960 1210 an open door what is it it was a revelation of the supreme deity of jesus christ not being a second person of the trinity but being god himself made flesh and dwelling among us and the revelation all right now the first time that name's been spoke here and spoke lost his name lutheran them coming down through it and when we get to in between that there was an open door between the sixth and seventh days two ages there was an open door the open door was a revelation of the deity of jesus christ the oneness doctrine began to start back in the zeus street people right the truth began to come forth an open door which was a revelation of the deity to go to the next one huh and what does it i know that works this is philadelphia in church age 60 12 10. i know that works behold i set before then open door what is the open door the revelation of the supreme deity of jesus christ what did he say to his first church age first church back here back in this sage he said i am he that was which is and shall come i am the first of the lies i'm the almighty he said it three different at times made himself deity to his first church here before he went into the life church age he said i set before you an open door if you want to see the revelation here it is or he would build his church and the only way he could take his church is is back to the revelation of what he is all right now so an open door was put between the sixth and seventh church age and that door never did close that's right right it's the unfailing of the unveiling of the deity of jesus christ all right now when you come to patmos john knew the door he had done wrote of it in his own writings and his gospel and then he had come down to see an open door to the church agency a revelation of the deity of jesus christ all right now i didn't bring this one but i didn't mean to say it but i will according to christ a mystery of god revealed i'm pretty sure it's been said before brother brown says that the bride is part of the mystery and must be revealed amen right so now we go up at 4-1 and we'll do this sunday so listen to the last few wording if the rapture takes place there and there's a prophet said she goes up in 4-1 it is the revelation of the deity of jesus christ that will take us up that's right and where he's at in his church and what he's doing all right then we go up and then we see revelation 4 5 6 7 8 ten then it's just what i was saying while ago when he said abraham can i withhold anything from you no i'm gonna show it to you now he's not gonna withhold anything to you from you and i now there will be a message down to the endless ages after we leave here yes wonderful but what we need to get there is going to be made known while we're standing here it's not going to be that we're going to heaven and we're going to get so don't get the idea when we start sunday now that the bride goes up in 4-1 and not saying in 1921. that's what your prophet said don't get any thought and idea in your mind of some form of revealing different than what we're getting here that's right because we're going to get the revelation here if he wouldn't withhold it from abraham what do you think about his bride and see what i love about it like i've always like i've said to you how many times now already that he showed revelations 1 how beautiful a diamond picture of the bride of jesus christ before he ever even started telling about the things you know that's not going to change we just have a choice of whether or not we're part of it right that's it right it's our choice but the fact that it's already there brother gary that means somebody is going to get it why can't we believe we're the ones well it's impossible because we're just look who we are we're just the peons of the message you know we're just a little old i'm glad he said he would reveal it to babies such as would learn 40 years of preaching on it he had to change it yet see the same message amen see jesus christ now i see him more in bright form and remember brother gary when you said that to me you said i see the bride i said you can't see it without seeing him first that's right i didn't mean that derogatory to his revelation because his revelation was correct and i said you've got to see the see jesus then you can see jesus in the bride because you can't see the bride without the groom right sister gail poor thing she's even started looking like brother dick after 60 something years you start looking like each other but you see what i'm talking about church the same voice he said that called you charlie told you to turn around we'll one day call you come on it's not going to be a surprise that's right it's not going to be a different voice i'm not trying to find another voice i'm not trying to find some other supernatural great revelation to come forth by some of these brothers that's run through the field with look i've got it and i've always told you you know this is true i've always told you that one day they that are off the work will have signs and wonders so if we're built on signs and wonders we will follow the those people right out of the word right that's right because they will have signs and wonders that's what the bible says that's right people are the spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters are my handmaidens so anointed ones will be going right along says look i told you i was right cause look what's happening i'm going brother dale you're not gonna join up with us they tried to put me in every camp they could so far i just hadn't found any that fit in i reckon because i just stand on what i believe that's right arrogant hateful i agree let me tell you let me tell you what you like that gets me done you know what i'm saying you look at me and you don't like me well that's okay i look at you don't like you either all right so we got any problem no but we're just trying to get to a place that's correct because listen folks i believe and i'm going to tell you what i believe i believe we will hear a voice calling us up that's right yes sir but it won't be like everybody's looking for right right it'll be just walking in the word until it just gets stronger and stronger and stronger and then we just walked right on off because the bride is going to be that final lord that's right come on brother take on these things an open door that will never again be shut but you see it will leave from us and go right on to israel go right on over to israel and still be revealing jesus christ to everybody we're going to stand here and see it before it comes into reality because we believe let's stand together take on december 15. have you heard that voice it does if you don't hear the voice in the new birth you won't hear the voice in the resurrection right amen if you don't hear the resurrection you surely want you're in the rapture you know the change so the main thing is whether or not we're born again right what we got right number 15 number 15 in the red book anybody have a need oh how is oh in the center oh but it would be okay is is oh i gather again oh i don't feel he's oh we get to learn how to maybe he's is just pray and please thank you bye what
