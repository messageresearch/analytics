========================================

in this so sinful world hardly a comfort can afford striving alone to face temptation so where could i go but to the lord where could i go where could i go seeking a refuge for my soul [Music] needing a friend to help me in the end where could i go but to the lord neighbors are kind i love them everyone we get long and sweet and cold but when my soul needs manna from above [Music] where could i go but to the lord where could i go where could i go seeking a refuge for my soul needing a friend to help me in the end where could i go but to the lord life here is grand with friends i love so dear comfort i get from god's own word yet when i face that chilling hand of death where could i go but to the lord where could i go oh where could i go seeking a refuge for my soul needing a friend to

holy you are holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see you amen god bless you thank you for coming out on a rainy night and it's middle of the week and we just need to recharge our batteries hey man we've been beat on for the past couple of days but we're good good to be back in the harness again good to be back in the house with the lord i told somebody the other day i said those two or three sermons that i set and watched at home i said i don't see how in the world y'all do that i just don't see how you can sit home and watch a service unless you just have to but just to do it because you want to oh i don't know i'm sorry the bible says assemble yourself together so and i know we need to to be careful what we're doing but i'm i'm saying this if that's your habit of doing that i just can't see that it's just not it's just not a church service unless you're here congregated around the word of god with with family church family right by way of announcements let's get those out of the way and then i want to say something just a few minutes about brother uh royale soriano we we miss him already and i i want to tell a little story about um i don't think anyone knows this i think i don't think i've ever told it before but we're still contemplating having putt-putt on friday night so it's supposed to rain and then it's supposed to not rain and it's supposed to be 50 percent chance and then i think maybe if why don't we just postpone it until until another time if it people are sick um brother bob's family may you know if they test positive uh everybody's trying to get over all this and and thank you for your prayers thank god i was one of the fortunate ones i did not have any of the symptoms except that i lost my sense of taste and a little bit of fatigue but no um nothing in my in my lungs or nothing in my no fever and just kind of took it easy and went stir crazy and probably probably stirred june crazy too but but man that quarantined business is for the birds also but um but we thank god that he got us through it and that uh and just continue to pray i've developed a little acid reflux which causes shortness of breath and and um i'm getting over that so i'm watching what i eat and uh but it's i don't know whether it comes from the covet or or people say that sometimes it'll attack a certain party part of your body and um so from right here to about right here burns a lot even if you don't eat anything so i'm trying to see somebody about that but i we need to see the great physician yeah he's he's got all the he's got all the remedies and we're going to turn it over to him so so let's just postpone the putt-putt until everybody can be there again i know there may not be a great time but uh june if you don't mind you'll call her and tell her the situation um we'll just postpone it until a later date also uh this coming sunday will be both services here uh we'll go ahead and continue to mask up and while you're inside the sanctuary um also remember then two weeks from now or two and a half weeks from now the 25th on saturday at 3 o'clock brother andrew glover will be here with we'll have a youth service on that saturday and then regular service on sunday so i think that's about it we'll i'll be doing both services sunday the lord willing so just keep us all in your prayers also i would like to tell this story about brother royale you know he and i went to uh palawan the both times i was in in the philippines and the first time we went we stayed in a in a rather nice motel and um and it kind of was he was like kind of out of his element because he he didn't you know he liked to sleep on a cot i guess or on the floor or wherever so the story that i'm gonna tell you'll see and so the second time we went over there we scheduled another meeting in palawan and we didn't stay in the good motel we stayed in a bungalow a little small place about the size of this pulpit here not much bigger than this pulpit but it only had one bed they didn't have any more they only had one bed and it was a small bed and brother royale with all his um oh sister chichi also told me she said make sure he takes his medicine yeah so ever so i would always make sure he took his medicine well we were getting ready to go to bed the first night and i told brother royle i said look i said you you take the bed you're the oldest in the room and men brother uh the other brother will sleep in the floor he wouldn't have none of that he said no brother he said you're my guest he said you're sleeping on the bed so i think we may have thumb wrestled or something and i and i lost and i kept trying to pull him up into the bed and he wouldn't he laid in that floor and went to sleep that night got up the next morning had to roll himself out of the floor and crawl up on the bed that's the kind of guy he was that's the kind of brother brother royal was he gave his life and i and i pray that um if i could say one more thing to him tonight we tried to make it to mount pinatubo for some of you that don't realize we built a church there we gave several thousand dollars to build a church and we were going to go dedicate it the second time we were there and because of the monsoon season or whatever the rainy season we could not get because you got to cross these rivers that swell up and you can't get across them without a boat and you really have to you rent one of those army jeeps to even try to get across as much as you can so we couldn't make it but that was on our heart to do the next time that if the lord tarried that we were going to go dedicate that church so if i have anything to say to him brother we'll dedicate that church someway somehow we'll dedicate that church if we have to dedicate it in the millennium because that was his desire he wanted to do that so bad and he tried so bad to get to get to to get us away over there and we just couldn't couldn't go but uh he was a real friend he was a real traveling companion and i miss him i i i don't even like to see the pictures they post on facebook because it brings back too many memories because i know he's in a better place we know that but still parting has sweet sorrow and i was glad to walk with that man for the years that i knew him he spent a week or so at our house one time and we had a blast got to really get to know both of them really well and i just know one thing's for sure if anybody made it he made it and i pray that somebody in the philippines will pick up that torch and will be the same can't be the same brother royale but will have that same desire that he had to get the message to the people of the philippines that was his desire and even to different places like hong kong and and dubai he traveled all over the place not sightseeing he's he went there for a on a mission and god said hey i'm finished with you now come and rest let's rest for a little while your labor's done so now please somebody pick that torch up in the philippines and take it to the to the people there through that church there with the overcomers we pray for them that there's a big gap that's got to be filled but you know what god knew that and he's got somebody he's got somebody that'll fill that gap up i just pray that they'll they'll get behind whoever it is and that they'll have that same zeal that brother royal soriano had because he was a real go-getter he was even with all the problems that he had in his body i went through that stroke for a year or so didn't do anything and and he just kept going on and kept going on and kept going on and we we love people like that that just gets up and goes when the devil knocks you down you just get right back up and take off again so we we thank brother royal for all the time i've had with him on the earth and um i'm looking forward to spending an eternity with him and there'll be no sorrow there'll be no sadness there'll be no pain there'll be no tears but he was a good brother and we'll miss him until we meet again i like what they say in jamaica they say until until you say what well until until we either meet in the rapture until we meet whichever you you know we pass on and go over there with him we'll meet again with our brother i believe on this earth and we'll go to mount pinatubo we won't have to do it in a bus we can travel like a thong but god bless you we love you with the love of the lord just keep us all in prayer we all have things that we have that we're trying to deal with with all this uh redo of covid coming back again and and and all these other sicknesses but god's the healer he knew these things were going to happen it's just part of our journey to to to have the right reaction and have the right attitude and have the right mental attitude to take us to the next level where we can get out of here because somebody is going to take this message and get out of here with it amen so we're just going to contend that it's us amen so if you got your bibles let's just we're going to tonight just real short um we're going to just go over something i mean background a little bit since it's been two weeks we just i think brother luis and brother aaron and brother bob for uh taking over while we were all um while we were out they did an outstanding job i think you ought to give them a good hand listen a lot of churches don't have that luxury a lot of churches would have to shut down or they'd have to play a tape or they'd have to bring a minister in but thank god that we've got a uh a stable full of of good horses amen that can uh that can carry this message on and continue on as we go and one more thing before i'm finished i'm not going to call any names but you know we a lot of times this is brother dale's watching in now so i want him to listen to this there's a lot of times that that sometimes we we're preaching our heart out and it seems like you know nobody's getting anything it seems like you know you're trying your best and you're just absolutely have you ever been stuck in gravel you just get stuck in gravel and you're throwing rocks everywhere and you're going nowhere but then when you get a a phone call from somebody that's watched online and they're absolutely rejoicing over the revelation that they got from what brother dale's brought all these years and they're watching and listening to the old sermons that he's preached and you see and you hear the joy in their in their voice and the man all he done was he was searching for truth and god told him to go online god told him he told us what he said god told him to go online and find a true preacher and he found brother dale about six years ago and he's been watching ever since so uh to him and all the other ministers sometimes we we may not be preaching right here to this congregation we're we're preaching to somebody maybe that that i mean this this brother is right in the middle of several message churches but the doctrines are all over the all over the all over the chart and i just thank god that we had a that we had a chance some people don't have a chance we've had a chance but what are we going to do with it what are we going to do about it okay so let's go to hebrews 9 11 i'm going to background just for a few minutes and then we'll go home because i want to finish this up this coming sunday the plan of eternal plan of redemption and then we will start on something else maybe on the son of man so hebrews 9 verse 11 let's pray before we before we get started heavenly father we we thank you lord for this day that you give us we pray lord that will not that as the bible says we'll redeem our time lord that will not waste our time from this day forward lord that will even though it looks like no one is fighting with you somebody is because you got an elect bride you've got a predestinated selected bride that's going to make it she's going to be the crown on your head she's going to be the fulfillment of all your word she's going to be that little armor meat packing girl that little wash woman not those three sisters that jumped around and shouted and screamed and had a big time no that little wash woman that washed the dishes and did her daily duty lord that's what caught your eye and thank god you sent us a prophet to tell us that story to make it so real and lord now we're making ourselves ready lord because we know that very soon we're going to be able to hear those wheels come down that old dusty dirt road and it's going to be you coming to take us home lord that we'll never have to suffer again that we'll never have to have a heartache or a trial or a temptation lord but we've got to make ourselves ready first we're not going to be the ones that's going to just be dilatory and just sit around and wait lord no we're going to press this battle we're going to take this thing by force and we're going to be victorious because that's what it says in the book that we are victorious through jesus christ father we pray that you'll be with the ones that are sick brother zach and uh kaylee and all the different ones that's been sick all week may they have a good report lord and no no virus uh test positive lord we praise us to just be with each one that's here be the ones lord that are not here the lord the ones that are that are recovering father we pray that you discover them by your blood thank you for keeping all of us safe lord and be lord ever present with us father from this day forward may we strive to do better lord may we take this sword and lord as the prophet said take it to the heart of the enemy and we've got to do it with a strong hand of faith father and we've got to believe though all hell breaks loose around us that lord you are the one that's conducting this battle and you've already won father we pray in the name of jesus christ that you would bless that the church family over in the philippines that you'd be with them lord give them comfort the only way that can be given is through you father comfort them lord with the loss of brother royale comfort sister chi chian and the two daughters lord we pray that you dispute with them father we love them just as real family father we pray that you just bless the people there may someone lord as i said before raise up in that congregation or in that in that area lord and take that sword and take that shield and lord take it to the enemy lord out there in the battlefield called the philippines lord we pray that you'll just bless each one forgive us of our sins take care of us lord bless brother dale keep him strong be with each one father that within the sound of my voice tonight father we pray in jesus name amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered him once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us let's read isaiah 65 this is what we'll get to sunday but i just want a background just for a minute and i want to bring a little point out and then we'll close isaiah 65 17 for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word let's read matthew 25 31 real quick when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd dividing his sheep from the goats now that look the son of man shall come in his glory so now let's go to matthew 16 verse 15. this is where they're talking to jesus he said unto them but whom you say that i am and simon peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to them but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church in other words this revelation i will build my church now not church nominal jesus's church is his bride all right jesus church he's going to build a bride he's not going to build a church he's going to be not going to build a building he's going to build a bride i will build my church and the gates of hell are going to try but they shall not prevail against him amen i love that so what happened during the church ages is that god was building his church and he was building his church on the foundation of the revelation that the son of god was the creator god but he was also the holy ghost that was going to come back on the day of pentecost and enter into 120 people and start god's church our bride all right so thank god though that there was a prophet coming in the end time that because during the church ages it all kind of got convoluted and it kind of the the vines intertwined and you couldn't tell one from the other and and you call church this and you call this but thank god we had a prophet coming the end time and he said now i call you bride i don't call you church anymore the church is going to go through the tribulation but the bride is not the church is going to go through this it's going to be a denomination it's going to take the mark of the beast but the bride is not so he separated that he took those two vines and he separated them away from each other because they had got so intertwined that there was no revelation no prevailing revelation to get us out of it until god did send a prophet and then when he sent that prophet he divided or took us back to the faith of the fathers and built his church on that and built this bride that we're talking about now the armored meat packing girl the one that gets herself ready the one that's going to finish this whole thing i mean finish it all it's going to be the bride of jesus christ the church is not going to finish the church is going to go through the tribulation the church is going to be persecuted the church is going to be going to go through the battle of armageddon the church is going to die and be left in the fifth dimension or wherever you want to put them at they're going to be left for another thousand years during the millennium that's where the church is going to be because the church turned god down revelations 3 14 all through there he's on the outside the prophet of god outside of the church trying to get back into his own place because he said i'll build my church and he did start building his church but they got to being what false doctrine and all these different things coming in and it got the vines all intertwined together and they took a profit to break them apart and like i said now we can read the bible and we can see where the church has to go through tribulation but the bride does not have to go through tribulation all right so there's the revelation that you and i get in the end time that will help us if we'll be able to see that excuse me that we'll see that the church is not the bride all right so now let's go to revelations 4 1 because this is not going to be the church the church does not take the rapture only the bride the church does not take the rapture all right so this is then only talking because brother branham was specific he didn't say john typed the church he said john typed the bride all right john typed the whole bride he did not type the church because in revelations 4 1 said after this i looked and behold the door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was that there were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither now there's your rapture and that's not the church that's the bride all down through the church ages but it's not the church it's the bride all right and i will show these things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one set on that throne so now immediately after that then the church has got to go through tribulation go to matthew 24 21 for then shall be great tribulation brother claude and i were talking about this today you know you look at the bible too and you thank god that we know we don't go through the great tribulation now we go through tribulation because tribulation worketh patience so we'll go through now remember the great tribulation though is the wrath of god poured out on the world and there's no bride here to stop it everybody got that all right for then shall be great tribulation that's the wrath of god that's poured out on the church because she didn't accept god as you and i accepted him as our husband lover whatever you want to call it as jesus christ our savior for there shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time now remember he's talking about noah and the flood even such as since the beginning of the world to this time no no ever nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect sake all right who's the elect that's me and you for the elect sake it's going to be shortened so it'll get us out of the way so that god will bring this great tribulation upon the world are the wrath of god all right so let's go to the next one revelations 2 verse 20. notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou suffereth that woman jezebel which calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication now we know what that is that's the church that's the mother that's the mother with the harlots to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed into idols and i give her space to repent two thousand years to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold i will cast her into a bed and then that committeth adultery with her into great tribulation see there great tribulation except they repented their deeds and we know that maybe some did but we know that there was a group that did not because that group is going to be in the lake of fire and that group is going to be not here during the thousand-year millennial reign so let's go to revelations 13 4 and they worship the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is likened to the beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 42 months now we're over into the part of daniel 70 weeks all right when we're already gone and he opened his mouth and blasphemed me against god to blaspheme his name his tabernacle and then that dwell in heaven pretty mad guy huh and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given unto all kindred and tongue and nations all right and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world thank god for a prophet to tell us though that there's a there's a lamb's book of life and then there's an eternal section there's a section that your name can be transferred from there's a section that your name can be wiped out of and then there's a section that your name can never be wiped out of amen if you're bride of jesus christ you're on the lounge book of life the eternal section you cannot be erased off of that you can't blaspheme the holy ghost if you've got the holy ghost amen but some people are going to do that and they're going to worship this person they're going to worship this person the whole earth all that dwell on the earth shall worship him no are they thinking they're worshiping the devil no they think they're worshiping god but he's deceived them but who is not going to be deceived me and you you and i if you've got the baptism of the holy ghost today you cannot be deceived that's right amen you can you can be in a little bit of deception but you can't be deceived enough to blaspheme and you definitely can't be you cannot be deceived enough to follow after this guy okay so there's that separation part that we were looking at now look let's go to revelations 11 3. and i want to bring something out after i get here in the daniel and then we'll close and i'll start back over sunday so i will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days closing sackcloth now who are these that's the moses and elijah the spirit of moses and the spirit of elijah and two prophets that are over in israel we're already gone the bride is in heaven the church is on earth the church is being persecuted at this time the bride is in glory and then god has a group of people are a remnant servants which is the 144 000 that's got to be called out during this 1260 days everybody got that say ma'am now i want you to keep this in the back of your mind that those two prophets they will open the sixth seal and we'll talk about that in just a minute it says these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth so let's go to daniel 9 24. the 70 weeks are determined upon thy people who is that the jews and upon thy holy city jerusalem to do six things finish transgression make an end of sins make reconciliation for iniquity bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy into the north the most holy so it's going to take 490 years for god to send enough i say send enough prophets and send enough preachers and send two witnesses it's going to take 120 i mean 490 years 7 7 is 490. 70 weeks it's going to take 490 years to bring israel back now it's not a continual 490 years we know that 483's already passed then there was calvary jesus was crucified so that cut off the gen the jews we've covered this before in the beginning of this and then god started dealing with the gentiles but he's not going to forget israel he's going to come right back in that last week and he's going to reconcile israel to him call out 144 000 and they're going now listen 144 000 is going to be called out during that time all right now but all hell's going to be breaking loose everywhere else everybody got that it's going to be worldwide and it's going to work its way over to jerusalem and then you've got the two witnesses that break that sixth seal open but now remember they break it open in its pure form according to the bible but now there has to be a six seal part that you and i get of sanctification that we'll talk about in just a minute and then i'll then we'll then we'll leave brother claude and i were talking about this so i thought i'd cover it and then we'll uh we'll get back to it sunday so let's go to jeremiah 30 verse 7. now what's happening here is is that god is going to promise israel two things for a surety he's going to save them and he's going to have somebody sit on the throne of david ruling the 12 tribes of israel he's promised this to israel israel knows that but watch this alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it all right for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him in other words the whole world is after israel they they're probably 50 of the people in this whole world would love to see israel just vanish right but he's not going to do that but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them now remember it's not david himself it's the lineage of david which is where jesus christ comes through the lineage of david it's not david we're not going to see david sitting on the throne ruling the 12 tribes of israel in the millennium we're going to see jesus christ but he's the son of david by faith all right therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity remember israel is israel's starting to come back but he's going to bring them all back and watch and jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make full end of all nations now look he's going to make an end of all nations this against israel though i make a full end of all nations whether i have scattered thee he told him he's going to scatter them remember we read that before he told him you're i'm going to scatter you because you can't be in this land and do the things you're doing but when you decide that you want to do the things that you that i want you to do i'm going to bring you back into this land and it was really strange i guess not really strange it was really the providence of god that the very the very next day that when israel declared their self a nation that the angel of the lord was right there in that cave giving brother branham his commission i don't know if you knew that or not but the very day and then the next day he said the angel appeared to me and gave me my commission that's 1947 or somewhere in there 40 whatever year they became a nation that but then what did brother brown say he said they started returning back they've been returning back ever since jews know they got to get in their homeland for god to talk to them right all right for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whether i have scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee and measure what daniel 9 24. i will correct you in measure and will not leave thee all together and punish listen he's punished israel he's been punished in israel since they hung him on a cross because they said let his blood be on us and our children so there's been a mark there that god has scattered them dispersed them he's not let them back in the homeland and people hate jews i mean they're the one of the most hated small group of people in the whole world why because they say they're god's people and they are but not all of them amen same way with me and you not all not all israel is israel as we were discussing yesterday afternoon not all israel is israel but be not dismayed though i make full end of all nations whether i have scattered thee yet will i make full a full end of thee but i will i will not make a full entity but i will correct then measure and will not leave the altogether unpunished let's go to revelation 6 verse 12. this is where i want to get to right here and then we'll uh then we'll stop revelation 6 verse 12 says look i beheld and when he had opened the sixth seal now to not make it to where we have to get into a great big discussion i know some that have been here for a long time they've heard the seals over and over again how brother dale preached them and how that um that we know that the seals do not break while we're here okay they break this seal right here will not break until we're gone right okay but we but why did brother branham preach it if we didn't need it so we have to get remember from revelations brother brown said revelations 4 1 to revelations 19 1 19 whatever 21 is not to the gentiles right but we've been all in it through this whole discussion we've been all through it we read the scriptures we've been reading well there's revelation 6. what do we do in revelation 6 if we didn't need it right as the gentiles so thank god for a prophet and thank god for a for a pastor that saw that there was a spiritual meaning of these seals that had to open to the bride first in a spiritual form and then the natural form would open all right so look this is what's going to happen and beheld when i he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sack cloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth and even as a fig tree casters are untimely figs when she is shaking of a mighty wind and the heavens departed as a scroll when it was rolled together atomic and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men the rich men the chief captains and the mighty men every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath see that's the wrath of god poured out upon a world that doesn't have the bride in it now it does have 144 000 still there and it does have the the the foolish virgin and and all those different ones but they're giving their life for what they believe but god is pouring out these on on the the ball of earth the earth not this earth he's literally pouring this out on the earth those two prophets brother brown said open that sixth seal any time they want to because remember what was the characteristics when we read there in revelations 11 and it says fire proceeded out of their mouth water was turned to blood it didn't rain for so many years what is that that's them controlling nature the physical part of nature so now and and then watch though and let's read what happens now in revelations for the great day of his wrath let's read that the last one for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand now listen that's not me or you but who's going to be able to stand revelation 7 verse 1 this will be the people that's going to stand and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree and i saw another angel sin from the east having the seal of the living god now what is the seal of the living god the baptism of the holy ghost that's the only seal there is we know there's seven seals and there's all we talk about seal there's only one seal grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption so this angel is bringing the seal now listen is that to us we're not here we've already been sealed okay now look the 100 i mean the the foolish virgin they don't get sealed that's the reason they're still here are they okay with this that's the reason the foolish virgin is still here they're not sealed in they don't get this seal because they're under the gentile dispensation which has been closed so who is this talking about only one group of people can receive the holy ghost after the bride leaves the earth and who is it it's going to tell you right here and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom was given to hurt the earth says hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants not the bride we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads all right remember everybody else that didn't get this seal were sealed in the forehead with the 666 right which is not a stamp it's just a number of men all right it's their doctrine and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were still 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel everybody got that so what's going to happen is he's going to hold the war the last war the war to hurt the earth and the sea and he's not going to hurt that place over there until these people are sealed in now i want to ask you a question though and we'll not read it we'll wait till this till sunday but what happens after the two witnesses preach and after the 144th now listen they're not all going to be sealed i don't think at the same time because then they could just do it in a day now the bible says israel be born in a day but why is he going to give them 1260 days to preach if it's not going to be like me and you we didn't all come in at the same time you saw it he didn't then he saw it and somebody else didn't you understand what i'm saying so it's going to take 1260 days to bring that 144 to seal them in well during that time what's going to happen there's going to be a sick seal that two prophets stand on the earth and they call fire they call the the stars to fall from heaven whatever they call the prophet of god says it's a total disruption of nature and it's controlled by two men it's controlled by two men now where do they get that power from the holy ghost the same holy ghost you got in you today same holy ghost there's not there's not different holy ghost now there's a holy ghost that goes into a gentile bride like we said before that does not make us remnant it makes us sons and daughters of god that is position everybody got that but it's not a different holy ghost it's the same holy ghost so now i want to ask you a question so after they're sealed in what happens to them now the bible says they had to be killed with the two witnesses now it's not in their verbatim that 144 000 are killed but the bible says the two witnesses are killed right and then they take a rapture with the prophet of god tells us that the 144 and go in a rapture after they're killed because remember they're not bribed so they can't take a body change down here you and i have already done that they have to be killed for what they believe and then they're re they're raised up as the two witnesses are raised up after three and a half days the two witnesses are raised up and then i believe they're raised up too because listen the whole world's not going to just hate the two witnesses they're gonna hate that 144 000 because they're going to be able to do what the two witnesses do now my whole point for tonight is is look that's the same holy ghost you and i have so it means that you and i have to have a sixth seal purging right that's right not a six seal purging of the earth this earth a six seal total disruption of your nature and what is the disruption of your nature everything you were born with is contrary to god everything you were born with is contrary to god that's why as we were talking last night just a group so some people about uh people believing that you had this eternal seed inside of you how are you going to have an eternal seed inside of you and you are born contrary to god now god knows when you're going to get it and he has the eternal seed which is the eternal word but you were born in sin you were born dead you can't do them things you didn't have the holy ghost inside of you and as we were talking last night some people say well it's laying there dormant how can an eternal seed be dormant i'm i'm a dumb country boy but that don't add up but you have an eternal seed inside of you but it's laying dormant now let me ask you a question did mary have a dormant seed inside of her or did god plant that seed inside of her to have the baby jesus you tell me was it just something laying there dormant inside of mary just waiting for the holy ghost to speak no i believe gabriel said the holy ghost will overshadow you and you will have a conception not by a man but by the man amen and there'll be a seed placed inside of you the seed of the woman you see how convoluted people get things but now you have the quotes where brother brown said you know he could say that that you have have this little you know there's one where brother brown said it starts out as a little button but if you'll read that quote he said when you get the holy ghost it starts out as that button what you've received something when jesus said receive you the holy ghost they didn't get it right there no now if they had an eternal seed laying there and the very person the very word of god said receive you the holy ghost what stopped that thing from giving them the holy ghost right then because they didn't have it it wasn't there for them to have jesus hadn't died yet to release that life to release the holy ghost so this sixth seal is very important for you and me because listen what happens after the actual sixth seal opens there's a rapture there's a rapture after the sixth seal opens when you and i when that sixth seal breaks to us and it totally disrupts our nature and turns our nature to that there'll be a rapture that's what you want to know what's holding the rapture off i'm holding it off because i hadn't got the divine all the divine nature of god inside of me and then the headstone which is the seventh seal which is him himself comes and fulfills itself because remember when we take the sixth seal let me ask you a question also because the bible says that after that the two witnesses and the sixth seal opens they just absolutely just turned the world upside down they're killed 144 000 are killed they're taken up in a rapture now daniel tells us that michael will now come on the scene and fight for israel maybe during the battle of armageddon i don't know but it calls michael which is who christ christ is those seals so if we'll get that where will you you say well now what are you talking about we need a sixth seal persian to get christ on the scene now we know we have him in the new birth but we don't have him in the headstone yet we don't have the fullness yet we're working toward that that's what's keeping us here but we need to look at that and see that we need a house cleaning we need a sick seal purging of all the things that we used to do you say well brother i've been born again and i don't have no this and that and the other and this and that and the other yeah well you might have not have that this and that and the other but you maybe you got something else coming maybe you got something else that you need to shake out get shook out of your house but that sick seal purging will purge a literal earth it'll purge a little earth but you and i it's going to purge our earth first because remember adam fell then the earth fell under him so now what is the world waiting for groaning and waiting for what the manifestation of the sons of god now listen the world's not waiting on this group right here this group's waiting on us but the whole world's not waiting on them to manifest who they are first the whole world's waiting on me and you to manifest who we are first according to romans 8 waiting for the manifestation i was reading the other day in the future home brother brown was somebody was saying quoting to him that we needed manifested sons of god in the millennium he said why do we need them in the millennium for why do we need healing in the millennium we don't need that we need it now they got the cart before the horse so you and i must realize that we have to have that same purging you know we're going through this eternal plan of redemption and we had to bring the seals into it somewhere because the seals is the total plan of redemption so now when six seals finish his redemption who comes on the scene christ so when the sixth seal finishes here and they're carried away who comes on the scene michael who comes on the scene christ remember what is the seventh seal it's the same as the seventh trumpet which is the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord and his christ which will be in the millennium after all this is done and over with so that was my point i wanted to bring because me and brother claude were talking about yesterday or today yesterday and today and that sixth seal's got a lot to do with us still being here because it's our nature that's got to be our nature has to be changed and even paul says having the mind of christ and and and all these things and do we that's my question tonight do we have the mind of christ yeah we're born again and yes we do have the mind of christ but boy i'm telling you my mind ain't all christ my physical brain don't think things it should think as far as christ is concerned but what we got to do though is is deny those things cast down those imaginations cast down those fears you say well they're real yeah i know they're real but you got to cast them down to become the stature of a perfect man that the six seal sanctification is going to absolutely not just me we were talking about this this um to that group the other night and and they've never seen it this way i don't think but you know they say well well you know i need to divorce all these things you know i need to get rid of this old husband if you divorce and your husband's alive you're living in adultery right bible right but now if sisters if your husband dies dies you're free to marry only in the lord but you understand what i'm saying you can't divorce them old things that you're dealing with you got to have them killed they got to die you can't hang them up in a closet and use them when you need them because you can't what you can't be married to two men at the same time according to the bible one of them's got to be dead right so all these things that we've got hidden in our closet you just divorced it you all you've done was just hit it i'm saying all of us those things have got to die now once they die christ says okay i can marry you now okay i can fill you with these faith virtual knowledge temper spaces godliness brother kindness thank god we've been taught right thank god that is important and that's part of the seal that's the sixth seal sanctification that right there one two three four five six then christ comes on the scene the holy listen god's waiting on that thing to seal us in that's not a different holy ghost that's waiting on him to fill the cracks up because we might have a divorce when we need a death that's my whole point i want us to realize everything has got to have a death involved with it remember what i tell you redemption is based on resurrection right and to have a resurrection something had to die amen jesus christ had to die and be resurrected to come back in the hearts of believer now we've got people that have passed on literally and they passed on but they're not dead and we're waiting on resurrection to bring it right back to where it's supposed to be but now listen we don't want a resurrection of that old person we don't want a divorce we don't want a separation some people just like separation we don't want separation we want a death that's why i say is as we go to the water to baptize we're going to a funeral if we're not going to a funeral you're just going to get wet but if you bury that thing and it die and you come up in newness of life there's that sick seal starting to work on you there's that nature that god's trying to put in there because remember the prophet of god said you're born with a nature contrary to god right your whole nature is contrary to god everything you did is contrary to god so let's let that as we see this as we'll stop here we'll just sing a couple of songs and then we'll be dismissed we see this sixth seal opening after we're gone from here but we got to bring that thing back to us to where we had a prophet come in the end time see we didn't need moses and elijah jews needed moses and elijah because they need those two prophets because that's what the bible said we needed a malachi 4 prophet one prophet one gentile prophet to tell us these things and to open the seals to show us a way back that our old husband is dead not divorced and that this is not us remember there was a doctrine brother brown said a campbell lights or somebody they thought the 144 000 was the bride and that's all there was going to be somebody had to teach that right amen so thank god that we've had the right kind of teaching because you know brother branham takes them uh now we may we may read it next week where the bible says in revelation i think 14 it says there was an you just couldn't number this group of people and they asked john said who is this and john said i don't know thou knowest why because it wasn't john's people john is a jew right and he said it's nations many tongues nations and people that's the bride that's me and you let's stand to our feet we need that nature change and it took a profit to prophesy over us to tell us we can have that nature change come on brother boy we can have that nature change we can have those seals open in a spiritual form to change this body because see without the statue of perfect man you can't have a body change without having these virtues working in your life and knowing what happens in each stage in each condition and that capstone being not filial love but agape love which is the love of god then we're not going to get out of here that's why we're still here but thank god we've had a prophet and we've had a um a five-fold ministry to teach us these things but just think on these things we need an interruption of our nature i mean man we i sat there for a week and and uh tried to do this and i studied a good bit in the word of god read a couple of books and and studied a little bit and i thought my this is sure is a change because see i work and then we come to church and then you know you got you get in a routine you get in the pattern you get in a rut and then you get totally disrupted from that what happens it disrupts your whole nature it just changes everything you got well maybe this thing is good for us to have a change to know that we gotta depend on god we gotta depend on god not depend on the doctors or depend on that shot or depend on whatever we got to depend on god amen now god gives us doctors and he gives us shots you understand i'm not neither neither way but i'm telling you we got to know who we are just like brother branham was standing he said now this is the church and this is the bride you better realize this is who you are right here that's right not this over here well i'm just going to be a good church member well you're going to go through the tribulation the wrath of god not just the wrath of man that's the wrath of god poured out on a nation or nations that turn against israel then the battle of armageddon and then you're not going to be able to live for another thousand years until that thousand years is over and you've got to come up to the white throne judgment you've got to give an account on what you've done thank god by the baptism of the holy ghost you never have to do that you never have to stand the judgment you've already you're standing it right now you've been judged worthy this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell that's what jesus said or the father said to jesus well that's the same thing happened to you when you get the new birth he's pleased to dwell in you or he wouldn't have picked you let's sing a song 705. sing a song just for a moment and then we'll dismiss you have long for sweet peace and have faith to increase and evernessly fervently pray but you cannot have rest or be perfectly blessed until the altar [Music] your heart does the spirit control you can only be blessed and have peace and sweet rest as you yield him your body and soul [Music] would you walk with the lord in the light of his word and have peace you must do this sweet will to be free from all you on the old [Music] when they put them lambs and they put those goats and different things on that altar they had to die control [Music] you can only be blessed and have peace and sweet rest as you yield him your body and soul oh we never can know what the lord will bestow of the blessings for which we have prayed to kill our body and soul heed a fully control and our all on the altar is laid think about it is your all on the altar of sacrificing your heart does the spirit control you can only be blessed and have peace and sweet rest as you yield him your body and soul let's and how happy our hearts will be made of

rest as you yield him your bodies and soul [Music] that's what we need to do yield to him in this hour of of uncertainty and desperation and whatever we're dealing with and all nervousness and let out there and let god have it give it to god give it to him let him let him let he said he said cast all your burdens he didn't say one or two he said cast all your burdens on me amen every one of them just cast them on him and say god i can't do it no more i've tried this i've tried that and that's our whole problem we've tried this and we try that just give it to god amen let's bow our heads dear
