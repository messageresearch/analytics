[10:34] with you i'd like to have you take your
[10:36] seats just for
[10:38] for a moment
[10:40] and before i
[10:42] get into the word first of all i want to
[10:44] bring greetings from my pastor brother
[10:46] biskell and all the saints up in
[10:49] cloverdale
[10:51] brother sam's been up there and
[10:55] brother ed still has
[10:57] whatever we talk about coming down to
[10:58] georgia he still remembers the the
[11:00] convention that uh that you sponsored
[11:03] there and that was one of the best
[11:05] conventions that we've ever
[11:07] ever had
[11:08] and it had a dramatic impact on missions
[11:11] all over the world
[11:12] because that was the focus for the
[11:14] convention
[11:16] and uh i'm thrilled to be back in the
[11:19] dale's house and they told me that
[11:21] bedroom has got my name on it and
[11:23] i'll tell you what that bed sleeps as
[11:25] good as any bed i've ever been on and
[11:29] it's so wonderful to
[11:31] see the whole
[11:32] dale family and the extended family and
[11:34] the new ones that i haven't seen since
[11:36] the last ones i've been here and it's
[11:38] good to see all your faces
[11:41] i want to give it a testimony real real
[11:44] quickly i don't want to take away from
[11:46] the word but you know there are days
[11:49] that take place in your life that
[11:52] literally transform
[11:54] your surroundings that transform
[11:57] literally transform your future and i
[11:59] had one of those experiences
[12:02] and it was a while ago brother sam had
[12:04] asked me to come down and speak at one
[12:06] of the fellowship meetings
[12:08] and at first you know i was i was ready
[12:11] willing and able and by faith i was
[12:12] going to come
[12:13] but as the time approached
[12:16] my feet were not cooperating
[12:19] and uh you know i i'd been stricken for
[12:22] for quite a while and had a real a real
[12:25] challenge
[12:26] and every day of that challenge i was
[12:28] just confessing and believing and i i
[12:30] believed that god was going to
[12:31] supernaturally touch my feet
[12:34] in the meantime i was doing everything
[12:36] that i could i was going to
[12:39] every doctor that i could and some of
[12:41] the people from my church they dragged
[12:43] me to
[12:45] some practitioners that i would not
[12:47] recommend to anybody
[12:50] if anybody ever suggests you get you get
[12:52] acupuncture make sure you get all the
[12:54] details before you
[12:57] before you go through it but anyways so
[13:00] uh i called brother sam and told him i
[13:02] would not be able to come
[13:03] and uh so we were talking and he was
[13:06] asking you know what was the problem so
[13:08] i told him and at that point
[13:11] brother sam said you know he said
[13:12] brother gary atkins he's been fighting
[13:15] the same condition with his feet for
[13:17] over 11 years
[13:19] and so to make a long story short
[13:21] brother gary called me and we began to
[13:24] talk and you know he told me everything
[13:26] that he had been through and i told him
[13:28] what i've been through and you know it
[13:30] was like my book was his book and his
[13:32] book was my book
[13:33] but only i hadn't gone through it for 11
[13:36] years
[13:37] and so he told me that that just
[13:39] recently he had gotten relief
[13:42] he told his podiatrist that the medic
[13:45] medication that she had prescribed
[13:47] wasn't working and so she said well i
[13:50] don't know much about pain but i can
[13:51] give you a referral to a pain clinic and
[13:54] so he went to the pain clinic
[13:56] and for the first time
[13:58] i think he had told me he went to about
[14:00] 25 doctors but for the first time he met
[14:03] a doctor who understood pain and
[14:05] understood what brother gary was going
[14:08] through and he was able to prescribe him
[14:11] some some medication
[14:13] so brother gary was kind enough to take
[14:15] some of the medication it was a
[14:16] medicated cream
[14:18] and
[14:19] it was made up of four different
[14:20] ingredients and so he sent some to me
[14:23] and i put it on my feet and for the
[14:25] first time
[14:27] in about nine months for the first time
[14:29] i could feel my feet again
[14:32] it was it was
[14:36] it was just like i mean it was you know
[14:39] to me it was a miracle cream because my
[14:41] feet were ice cold and they were numb
[14:44] and when i walked it was like walking on
[14:46] pins and needles so just going from from
[14:49] my bedroom to the bathroom that was a
[14:52] challenge going to the kitchen it was
[14:54] like going to war to try to get to the
[14:56] kitchen and uh you know get something
[14:59] but i'm so thankful for the saints in my
[15:01] assembly because
[15:03] they brought over food that could have
[15:05] fed 10 people
[15:06] and my phone was ringing and i had
[15:09] visitors and
[15:10] you know i'm just so thankful for the
[15:12] family of god and like brother branham
[15:14] said in the last days the only place
[15:17] that true love would be found was in the
[15:19] bride
[15:20] so brother gary told me he said brother
[15:22] ernie's i'm gonna send you this this
[15:24] cream and it worked for me and he said
[15:27] now uh he said you need to find a pain
[15:30] clinic in your area like like i find you
[15:33] need to find a doctor in your area like
[15:35] my doctor in georgia and he said now
[15:37] you're going to have to go through some
[15:39] hoops and hurdles because you just can't
[15:41] call up the pain clinic and say i want
[15:43] to come in i i tried that i tried to
[15:45] call the pain clinic and the lady she
[15:48] sounded like she thought i was nuts she
[15:50] said she said she says you can't call
[15:51] here make an appointment i said why not
[15:54] you're a doctor she said you need a
[15:56] referral
[15:57] so i go to my doctor
[15:59] and and i tell them and my doctor uh you
[16:02] know he says well he said you're going
[16:03] to have to make sure your insurance
[16:04] company is going to cover it so i called
[16:06] my insurance company they said we want
[16:08] you to see one of our doctors
[16:10] so uh you know and i just got this
[16:12] insurance company because when obamacare
[16:14] came came in my insurance company of 32
[16:18] years my health insurance company told
[16:20] me they wrote me a beautiful letter
[16:22] beautiful but at the end it said we're
[16:24] so sorry we cannot cover you anymore
[16:27] because we cannot provide the coverage
[16:29] that's mandated by obamacare
[16:32] and so so i just got this insurance
[16:34] company and they said well we want you
[16:36] to go to one of our doctors and i did
[16:38] and then with his doctor's or his
[16:40] uh prognosis was we want you to go and
[16:43] get a sonogram from your knees down to
[16:45] your feet to make sure that it's not
[16:47] something else
[16:48] and then after he found out it wasn't
[16:50] something else he said well i want you
[16:51] to go to the doctor and get your feet
[16:53] checked electronically and so they put
[16:56] all kinds of gadgets on me check out no
[16:58] it wasn't that i knew what it was and so
[17:00] finally they gave me a referral go to
[17:02] the pain clinic and
[17:04] thank god i found the doctor like
[17:07] brother gary was saying that understood
[17:10] pain understood what i was going through
[17:12] and he was able to to to write me up a
[17:15] prescription for that cream and
[17:18] you know everything everything has
[17:20] changed since then
[17:22] and i'm so thankful to brother gary and
[17:25] and sister rebecca i believe that she
[17:27] went to the post office i don't know how
[17:29] many times it went to the post office
[17:30] because every time brother gary had a
[17:32] little extra cream while i was going
[17:34] through the hoops and hurdles he would
[17:36] send it to me
[17:37] and uh well my secretary she was getting
[17:39] my mail whenever she would tell me that
[17:41] the package had arrived from brother
[17:42] gary it's rebecca i mean it was it was
[17:45] like hallelujah sunday
[17:48] so
[17:49] i want to thank i want to thank
[17:54] i want to thank brother sam for the
[17:56] invitation to come here today and like i
[17:58] say there are some days that change your
[18:01] life and that day the brother sam put me
[18:03] in contact with brother gary and the day
[18:05] brother gary called me
[18:07] radically and dramatically changed my
[18:10] life because i mean i i was in a
[18:13] situation where there was nothing i
[18:15] could do i tried everything
[18:18] and and nothing worked and
[18:20] so i knew there was an answer out there
[18:22] somewhere either supernaturally or
[18:25] medically and i'm back on my feet again
[18:28] this is my first i've you know i've been
[18:29] preaching locally in washington made a
[18:32] couple of trips down to california but
[18:34] this is my first trip cross country and
[18:37] um
[18:38] i've been in this this sunday will be 10
[18:40] meetings that i've had over the last two
[18:42] weeks and i feel stronger now than i did
[18:45] when i left my house
[18:47] and uh you know you know when when you
[18:50] believe you can do it is one thing but
[18:52] when you actually go out and do it then
[18:54] you've got that locked in you say i can
[18:57] do it and there's nothing that's going
[18:58] to hold me back
[19:00] so god bless you brother sam god bless
[19:02] you brother gary thank you sister
[19:04] rebecca god bless you
[19:07] hallelujah so now i'd like to ask you to
[19:10] to
[19:11] stand to your feet and i'd like to
[19:13] invite you
[19:15] to go to the book of
[19:17] esther
[19:19] and while you're turning to the book of
[19:21] esther i'd like to make a couple of
[19:23] comments that the book of esther is a
[19:25] very unusual book
[19:27] it's a remarkable book it's one of only
[19:30] two books in the bible that are named
[19:32] after a woman
[19:34] now one other thing this may surprise
[19:36] you and if for some it won't but some it
[19:39] will
[19:40] the the surprising thing about the book
[19:42] of esther is that the name god is not
[19:45] mentioned one time in the entire book
[19:48] and prayer is not mentioned one time
[19:51] in in the entire book
[19:53] and uh what we're going to start reading
[19:56] is about a pagan feast with a pagan king
[20:02] and his name is a hosp but actually his
[20:05] real name was xerxes because the
[20:08] haucerus was a title like pharaoh or
[20:11] caesar
[20:12] and
[20:13] so we'll start reading
[20:15] at verse 1 and let's pray before we read
[20:19] father
[20:20] how thankful we are to know what we know
[20:23] to see what we see and to hear what we
[20:25] hear
[20:26] and to know that we have the punctuation
[20:29] of thus saith the lord
[20:31] in the message we read in the life that
[20:34] we live
[20:35] and we know that it's you who's living
[20:37] through us
[20:38] lord i i shudder to think where i would
[20:40] have been had i missed the connection
[20:43] that day that you sent somebody by my
[20:45] way and shared with me that god had sent
[20:48] a vindicated prophet in this day
[20:52] lord i'm so thankful for the opportunity
[20:55] to be able to speak
[20:57] to the believers in the congregation
[21:00] today and lord a congregation this size
[21:02] we know that there are many needs that
[21:05] are present
[21:06] various needs physical financial
[21:09] decisions that have to be made each one
[21:12] of us i'm sure has those that we that we
[21:15] love our family members and those that
[21:17] we come in contact with that we want the
[21:20] token
[21:21] to be proactive in our lives so it can
[21:24] be proactive in their lives father so i
[21:26] pray that you would you would bless
[21:29] each one here in divine presence i pray
[21:31] that you would give them great faith to
[21:33] be able to say today i am going to
[21:36] exercise my faith upon this need whether
[21:40] it's in my body whether it's in
[21:42] my family lord whatever it is
[21:45] let this be a red letter day and i pray
[21:48] that you had helped me lord to move
[21:50] myself out of the way and let only the
[21:52] holy ghost be heard
[21:54] and we ask that you had blessed the
[21:56] reading of the word i pray that each one
[21:59] would be able to walk out of this
[22:01] building today and say it was great to
[22:04] be in the house of god today amen god
[22:07] bless you
[22:10] chapter one verse one now it came to
[22:13] pass in the days of ahacerous this is a
[22:15] hosp which reigned from india even unto
[22:19] ethiopia over a hundred and seven and
[22:22] twenty provinces
[22:24] now if it you know when when you're
[22:27] able to spend a lot of time you know
[22:30] brother branham he says uh
[22:35] in
[22:36] the message redemption he says
[22:39] do you like to read between the lines he
[22:42] said why the best part of the bible is
[22:44] wrote between the lines and so i love to
[22:47] read between the lines and as brother
[22:50] sam was saying at the meeting if you
[22:52] can't see jesus in every scripture he
[22:55] said go back and read it again and you
[22:58] know
[22:59] one thing i do if i can't you know if i
[23:01] can't understand a verse i'll go to the
[23:04] verse above it or the verse below it if
[23:06] i still can't understand it i'll go to
[23:08] the beginning of the chapter and i'll
[23:10] read it all the way to the end of the
[23:12] chapter because there is a revelation
[23:15] that god has in every chapter of that
[23:18] bible something for our edification and
[23:21] so one of the things that i found out
[23:23] was that it's a hostarous he was
[23:26] reigning over somewhere around a hundred
[23:29] million people
[23:31] this was the medes in persia the second
[23:33] great empire after the babylonian empire
[23:36] he said that in those days when the king
[23:39] of hosters sat on the throne of his
[23:40] kingdom which was in shusha on the
[23:42] palace in the third year of his reign he
[23:45] made a feast unto
[23:47] all his princes and his servants the
[23:50] power of persia and media the nobles and
[23:53] princes of the provinces being before
[23:55] him when he showed the riches of his
[23:57] glorious kingdom and the honor of his
[24:00] excellent majesty many days even a
[24:03] hundred and four score days so this is a
[24:06] hundred and eighty day feast this was a
[24:09] banquet to end all banquets there was
[24:12] sumptuous food there was drink there was
[24:15] everything that you can imagine and it
[24:18] just went on and on and on and on but
[24:20] there was a motive as we'll find out why
[24:23] this king had this great banquet
[24:26] said
[24:29] when he showed the riches of his
[24:31] glorious kingdom in the honor of his
[24:33] excellent majesty
[24:34] many days even a hundred and four score
[24:37] days and when these days were expired
[24:40] the king made a feast unto all the
[24:42] people that were present in shushan the
[24:44] palace in other words
[24:46] this was for his noble men his princes
[24:49] from all the 127 provinces they all came
[24:53] in and now in the last seven days
[24:56] he invited all the local people that
[24:58] wanted to come in to join in the feast
[25:02] both under great and small seven days in
[25:05] the court of the garden of the king's
[25:07] palace god bless you you can you can
[25:10] have your seats and i just want to
[25:12] continue a little bit he says
[25:16] where were white green and blue hangings
[25:20] fastened with the cords of fine linen
[25:22] and purple to silver rings and pillars
[25:24] of marble the beds
[25:27] the beds were of gold and silver how
[25:30] many ever slept on a gold bed
[25:32] or a silver bed
[25:38] upon a pavement of red and blue and
[25:40] white and black marble
[25:42] and they gave them drink in vessels of
[25:44] gold the vessels being diverse one from
[25:46] another and royal wine in abundance
[25:49] according to the state of the king and
[25:52] the drinking was according to the law
[25:53] none did compel for so the king had
[25:56] appointed to all the officers of his
[25:58] house that they should do according to
[26:01] every man's pleasure
[26:04] now
[26:05] the the feast that was going on it was
[26:08] for a purpose and a hausaurus he wanted
[26:11] to rule the world that was his great
[26:14] desire and he had this feast he brought
[26:17] all his princes and noblemen brought
[26:20] them in here for one purpose and that
[26:22] was to show him he said i have got the
[26:25] goods to fight this war he wanted to go
[26:28] to war and he wanted to wipe out the
[26:30] greeks he wanted to take over that that
[26:33] you know that that part of his empire
[26:35] and so he had to bring these men in and
[26:38] he had to show them his glorious wealth
[26:41] and and the pageantry of everything that
[26:44] was before them and it gave them
[26:47] confidence that hey this this guy he's
[26:49] you know he's got the anointing upon him
[26:52] you know it wasn't a holy anointing but
[26:54] you know it was it was an anointing and
[26:56] these people you know it's like you know
[26:58] i remember one time
[27:00] a brother was saying he said you know if
[27:02] right now if the pope in all his
[27:05] pageantry you know came you know came uh
[27:09] running by the front of your house
[27:12] you know you would want to go there and
[27:14] you'd want to look because they know how
[27:16] to put on the dog so to speak and so
[27:19] that's what a hostas was doing and so
[27:22] now it says in vashti the queen she made
[27:25] a feast for the women in the royal house
[27:27] which belonged to the king a hospital so
[27:30] she's having her own feasts the men and
[27:32] the women they could not come together
[27:34] at that time and so she's having her
[27:37] feasts for the women and
[27:39] and
[27:40] basically she's a woman's liber
[27:43] and uh you know
[27:44] we'll see down here on the seventh day
[27:47] when the heart of the king was merry
[27:49] with wine in other words he was drunk
[27:52] he had been drinking for 187 days and uh
[27:56] you know everybody around there was
[27:58] probably a little bit fuzzy so now the
[28:01] king he makes a mistake he makes a
[28:04] mistake and that is i am going to show
[28:08] all my kings all my princes all all my
[28:12] noblemen i'm going to show them my crown
[28:15] jewel and he calls for vashti the queen
[28:19] to come in
[28:20] now vashti when she hears this she said
[28:23] hey this this is not according to the
[28:26] law he should not be doing this he
[28:28] doesn't have a right to do that and she
[28:30] knew you know she knew her husband real
[28:32] well she knew what he was up to and so
[28:35] she had a choice she could either go in
[28:38] and do
[28:39] what he wanted her to do it would have
[28:42] probably
[28:43] humiliated her it probably would have
[28:46] been a spectacle
[28:48] and you know and all the people looking
[28:50] and glaring and all these drunk people
[28:53] and probably lusting you know lusting
[28:55] after her but but he had the most
[28:58] beautiful girl in the kingdom vashti
[29:01] means beautiful
[29:03] and so she had that choice and the
[29:05] choice she made is i am not going in
[29:10] now if she had made the choice to go in
[29:13] she probably would have suffered some
[29:15] you know some embarrassment some
[29:17] humiliation but eventually she would
[29:20] have got over it she would have
[29:21] continued to be the queen and uh you
[29:24] know they they could have just wrote
[29:26] another chapter but she dug in her heels
[29:29] and she said i am not going in now you
[29:33] can imagine if you're the king
[29:35] and you've got all your noblemen from
[29:38] 127 provinces and you make the
[29:41] proclamation and he probably said
[29:44] bring in the queen
[29:46] i want to show
[29:48] my queen's beauty to everybody
[29:51] so
[29:52] now it was heard that vashti's not
[29:56] coming in
[29:57] you want to talk about gossip
[30:00] you know what they say the definition of
[30:02] gossip
[30:03] gossip is a dainty morsel eaten with
[30:06] great relish
[30:08] see and so now you can imagine the buzz
[30:11] that was going through you know this
[30:13] great convention whoa wow this is this
[30:15] is never seen anything like this before
[30:18] what's the king gonna do now why is she
[30:20] not coming in see
[30:23] and so so so now
[30:26] it says in verse 12 but the queen vashti
[30:29] refused to come at the king's
[30:31] commandment by his chamberlain's
[30:33] therefore
[30:35] was the king very roth and his anger had
[30:38] burned in him
[30:40] so now on on the seventh day if we go
[30:43] back here to
[30:44] to chapter or verse 10 on the seventh
[30:47] day when the heart of the king was merry
[30:49] with wine he commanded muhuman bitha
[30:52] habana biktha abatha zethar and carcass
[30:56] now remember that that carcass now these
[30:59] people these these seven chamberlains
[31:02] they were eunuchs in other words they
[31:04] were so committed to the king and his
[31:06] kingdom that they had had themselves you
[31:09] know that their manhood was taken away
[31:12] from them because you know that this is
[31:14] a
[31:15] don't mistake this as any part of a
[31:18] spiritual feast or any religion this is
[31:21] a pagan heathen
[31:23] feast
[31:25] and who knows you know what was going on
[31:27] at this feast
[31:29] but
[31:30] these seven seven chamberlains they were
[31:33] the men that the king could trust in all
[31:36] of his harems
[31:38] and all the concubines that he had and
[31:40] that last one his name was carcass and
[31:43] we know where the carcass is the eagles
[31:46] will gather
[31:48] so now when vashti wouldn't come in
[31:51] the king was very roth and his anger
[31:54] burned in him and the king said to the
[31:56] wise men which knew the times for so was
[31:58] the king's manner toward all that knew
[32:00] law and judgment and the next unto him
[32:02] was karshena shethar admitted tarshish
[32:06] mers marcina and mameokin the seven
[32:09] princes of persia and media which saw
[32:12] the king's face these guys knew the king
[32:15] and now they're they're looking they're
[32:17] looking at his face and he is not a
[32:19] happy camper he is mad he's drunk and
[32:23] he's mad
[32:24] dangerous combination
[32:26] you know the word anger if you take the
[32:28] word anger and you put the letter d
[32:31] before anger you got danger
[32:33] and the d is the devil you know
[32:36] you know i can remember 20 years ago we
[32:39] never heard the the term road rage but
[32:41] now you get on the highway and you see
[32:43] it every five minutes and sometimes you
[32:46] see it more than that and people get all
[32:48] kinds of signs and signals and horns
[32:50] beeping you know i mean you know they're
[32:52] just going if you're not going 85 miles
[32:54] an hour down the freeway they're right
[32:56] on right on your bumper
[32:58] and and so now the king he is really
[33:02] really
[33:03] upset
[33:06] then the king said to the wise men which
[33:08] knew the times for so was the king's
[33:10] manna taught all that new law and
[33:12] judgment and the next unto him was
[33:14] karshina shether admither tarshish murs
[33:17] mashina and manukin now that that fellow
[33:21] mamukin
[33:22] i just want to give him a name this is
[33:24] milk toast mamukan
[33:27] and and i'll i'll show you why the seven
[33:29] princes of persian media who saw the
[33:31] king's face and which sat uh the first
[33:34] in the kingdom now the question is put
[33:37] forth what shall we do unto the queen
[33:39] vashti according to the law because she
[33:42] had not performed the commandment by
[33:44] king of hostas by the chamberlain's and
[33:47] mammookin milk toast mamukin he steps up
[33:50] and he says he answered
[33:52] before the king and the mukin answered
[33:55] before the king and the princes vashti
[33:57] the queen hath not done wrong to the
[34:00] king only but also to all the princes
[34:03] and to all the people that are in the
[34:05] provinces of king of hosurus for the
[34:08] deed of the queen shall come abroad unto
[34:11] all women so that they shall despise
[34:14] their husbands in their eyes when it
[34:16] shall be reported that king of hostas
[34:19] commanded vashti the queen to be brought
[34:21] in before him but she came not so what
[34:23] he's saying is hey you know i don't want
[34:25] any problems here i don't want you know
[34:27] i don't want these women you know to to
[34:29] get empowered and say hey if the queen
[34:31] doesn't have to obey uh the king why do
[34:34] i have to obey my husband and mamookin
[34:38] he's probably saying i got enough
[34:39] problems trying to keep my wife under
[34:41] control because he was the first one to
[34:43] step up you know he says he says you
[34:45] know we've got to do something about
[34:47] this because not only has vashti
[34:49] insulted the king but we're going to
[34:51] have big problems all over the kingdom
[34:54] when the women find out
[34:56] that that the queen
[34:58] disobeyed the king
[35:00] and so he said likewise shall the ladies
[35:03] of persia and media say this day unto
[35:05] all the king's princes which have heard
[35:07] of all the deeds of the queen
[35:09] thus shall there arise too much contempt
[35:13] and wrath he said i don't want any wrath
[35:16] in my house i don't want any contempt in
[35:18] my house i want the status quo i want
[35:21] things to stay the way that they are now
[35:24] where the the man he has rule over his
[35:27] house he said this is going to upset the
[35:29] apple cart so to speak
[35:32] he said never please the king let there
[35:34] be a royal commandment from him and let
[35:36] it be written among the laws of the
[35:37] purge and the medes that it be not
[35:39] altered that vashti come no more before
[35:42] king of hospitals and let the king give
[35:44] her royal estate unto another that is
[35:48] better than she and when the king's
[35:50] decree which he shall make shall be
[35:52] published throughout all his empire that
[35:54] word all a-l-l all his empire 127
[35:59] provinces for it is great all the wives
[36:02] shall give to their husbands honor
[36:06] both to great and small
[36:09] and the same pleas the king and the
[36:10] princes and the king did according to
[36:12] the word of mammookin now here's where
[36:15] you know read a little bit between the
[36:17] lines so the first thing that has to
[36:19] happen is the king decides okay we're
[36:22] going to make this this commandment and
[36:24] then he gets his signet ring and he
[36:26] takes that and he seals that and it
[36:28] cannot be altered
[36:30] and then the scribes have to be called
[36:33] in and this is a big job because you've
[36:36] got many many languages and many
[36:39] dialects
[36:40] throughout this 127 provinces and so all
[36:44] the scribes had to come in and each
[36:46] scribe had to write this decree out in
[36:50] his language or in in his dialect so it
[36:53] was a massive massive project they
[36:56] didn't have printers and computers they
[36:58] couldn't take their email address list
[37:00] and put it on there and zap it out to
[37:03] everybody it was a very labor-intensive
[37:07] very time-consuming project and so now
[37:10] once the scribes once they got their job
[37:13] done then they had to call in all the
[37:15] runners all the messengers and they had
[37:18] to call in the horses and the camels and
[37:21] the mules and this project had to go
[37:24] forth and it would took a long time for
[37:27] them to reach all into the kingdom of a
[37:29] hundred million people over the 127
[37:32] provinces
[37:36] for he sent letters unto all the king's
[37:38] provinces
[37:39] into every province according to the
[37:42] writing thereof and to every people
[37:44] after their language that every man
[37:47] should bear rule in his own house and
[37:49] that it should be published according to
[37:52] the language of every people
[37:55] now
[37:57] in in chapter 2 it says after these
[38:00] things
[38:02] and the first thing that we would think
[38:04] of is after these things after the queen
[38:08] had refused to come in
[38:10] to to see the king
[38:12] so that's what you know my mind when i
[38:15] read esther many many times but as i had
[38:19] a lot of time on my hand and this is one
[38:21] of my favorite books because you know
[38:24] the theologians they don't even know why
[38:27] this book is in the bible
[38:29] because god's not mentioned because
[38:31] prayer is not mentioned and because it
[38:32] was it was named after a woman it was
[38:36] the last book to go into the canon of
[38:39] scriptures
[38:40] and so now you know
[38:42] but but god's hand is in this book in
[38:45] such a miraculous way so i began to read
[38:48] and i i began to go into every
[38:51] commentary i could find and to go online
[38:54] and and i found out that between this
[38:56] time that esther had refused to go in to
[38:59] see the king and the king sent that
[39:01] proclamation that esther could no more
[39:04] come in that the the motive for him
[39:07] having the feast in the first place was
[39:10] put into action and he went to war
[39:13] and he went to war with the greeks
[39:16] and he had this that they say somewhere
[39:19] the estimates range wildly it goes for
[39:22] anywhere from 100 to 150 000 men up to a
[39:25] million men that were under his control
[39:28] and he mobilized these forces and he
[39:31] went out and he fought the battle and
[39:34] the name of the battle is
[39:37] it's thermop thermopylae t-h-e-r
[39:46] and uh when he went out to fight this
[39:48] battle he thought because he had such a
[39:51] an
[39:53] abundance of soldiers that he could go
[39:56] there and he knew that the greeks didn't
[39:58] have anywheres near the men that he had
[40:00] but what he didn't know were the greeks
[40:03] they were ferocious warriors
[40:06] and it was said that one of these greek
[40:08] soldiers could take out ten of
[40:11] ahostarus's men because they knew war
[40:14] they knew battle they they
[40:16] they they were armored but but you know
[40:19] the the the the soldiers of the medes
[40:21] and persia they had never been in a
[40:24] battle with with ferocious soldiers like
[40:27] that and so the king he suffered a most
[40:31] embarrassing and a humiliating defeat
[40:34] lost his troops he had over 300 ships
[40:38] that were sunk during this battle and so
[40:40] now he's back and he's sitting in his
[40:43] throne and he's he's humiliated and now
[40:47] it says it says that the king
[40:50] after these things after this incredible
[40:54] humiliating battle
[40:56] when the wrath of the king of hostrus
[40:58] was appeased he remembered vashti and
[41:02] what she had done and what was decreed
[41:04] against her now you know what he
[41:06] remembered he remembered that vashti was
[41:09] beautiful vashti was my queen vashti was
[41:13] the love of my life
[41:15] and in a drunken stupor i made a
[41:19] horrible mistake
[41:21] and and i called her in which i
[41:24] shouldn't have done and now i've made
[41:26] this decree and i'm never going to be
[41:29] able to see her again i'm never going to
[41:32] be able to see the love of my life again
[41:36] he remembered what vashti had done and
[41:39] he remembered the decree that vashti the
[41:41] queen who would not come in she can
[41:44] never come in again and he signed it
[41:47] could not be altered
[41:51] then said the king's servants that
[41:54] ministered unto him because they could
[41:57] see they could see the king he was in a
[41:59] deep dark dungeon of depression and
[42:02] despondency and the disillusionment and
[42:05] despair and disappointment
[42:07] and you know the horror of of what he
[42:10] had just experienced and to be alone
[42:13] in the kingdom it were before he
[42:16] remembered his life prior to that and
[42:18] how he and vashti had had just a
[42:21] wonderful life
[42:23] and now he's alone defeated
[42:26] wounded scarred emotionally i'm talking
[42:29] about he's wounded he's scarred he's
[42:31] bruised you know and and now his men
[42:34] they see that they say we got to do
[42:36] something here we got to do something to
[42:38] shake up
[42:40] shake up what's going on around here
[42:46] then said the king's service that
[42:48] ministered unto him let there be fair
[42:51] young virgins
[42:52] sought for the king and let the king
[42:54] appoint officers in all the provinces of
[42:56] his kingdom
[42:58] that's all the provinces of his kingdom
[43:03] that they may gather together all
[43:06] a-l-l all
[43:08] the fair young virgins on the shouse on
[43:11] the palate to the house of the women
[43:14] under the custody of hagee the king's
[43:16] chamberlain keeper of the women and let
[43:19] their things for purification be given
[43:22] them and let the maiden which please the
[43:24] king be made queen instead of vashti and
[43:27] the thing pleased the king and he did so
[43:30] now you know what happened at this time
[43:33] all the scribes had to be brought back
[43:35] in and every one of them had to sit down
[43:38] and they had to write out the new decree
[43:41] and then after they got all the language
[43:43] and dialects done they had to call in
[43:45] the runners and the messengers and the
[43:47] horses and the mules and and all those
[43:50] things had to be brought in and again a
[43:53] massive time-consuming labor-intensive
[43:56] project goes underway because all the
[43:59] kingdoms have got to be notified that
[44:02] all the fair young virgins are invited
[44:04] in
[44:05] to a royal beauty contest
[44:09] and if you win the contest you're gonna
[44:12] be the queen
[44:13] and so i mean you know all the all the
[44:16] beautiful girls that that that were you
[44:18] know that were fair to look upon they
[44:20] were brought in and there were probably
[44:23] thousands of them that were brought in
[44:25] of 127 problems if there was only 10 out
[44:29] of each province uh you know that would
[44:31] be over a thousand and so now they're
[44:33] brought in and they're given all their
[44:35] things for for purification
[44:40] now in shushan
[44:41] the palace there was a certain jew whose
[44:44] name was mordecai
[44:46] now the word mordecai it means a little
[44:49] man
[44:51] okay and uh
[44:52] i think you probably know where i'm
[44:54] going with this mordecai the little man
[44:57] the son of jair the son of shimaya the
[44:59] son of kish of benjamin who was carried
[45:02] away from jerusalem with the captivity
[45:05] which had been carried away from
[45:07] zechariah king of judah whom
[45:10] nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had
[45:12] carried away so now there were some that
[45:15] went back but many preferred to stay
[45:18] because it was comfortable it was a good
[45:21] light they enjoyed it and it's estimated
[45:23] that there were approximately 15 million
[45:26] jews
[45:27] that were in a hospital's kingdom
[45:30] and he brought up hadassah that is
[45:33] esther and the word esther means a star
[45:37] his uncle's daughter
[45:39] so actually
[45:40] mordecai and esther were cousins but
[45:43] mordecai was older for she had neither
[45:47] father nor mother and the maid was fair
[45:49] and beautiful whom mordecai when her
[45:52] father and mother were dead took for his
[45:54] own daughter so it came to pass when the
[45:57] king's commandment and his decree was
[45:59] heard and when many maidens were
[46:02] gathered together unto shushon the
[46:04] palace to the custody of hagai that
[46:06] esther was brought also under the king's
[46:09] house to the custody of hagai keeper of
[46:12] the woman now friends at this point in
[46:16] time the supernatural has to be evident
[46:20] because mordecai has just taken esther
[46:25] a jewish girl he's now taken her and
[46:29] entered her into a pagan beauty contest
[46:33] to become the queen of a heathen kingdom
[46:37] okay so
[46:39] an esther
[46:40] and and so now
[46:44] and the maiden pleased him and she
[46:46] obtained kindness of him and he speedily
[46:49] gave her things for purification with
[46:50] such things as belonging to her and
[46:53] seven maidens which shall meet to be
[46:54] given to her in other words so she was
[46:56] you know she was given some some special
[46:59] treatment because everywhere she went
[47:01] she found favor with all the people
[47:04] probably her humility and her kindness
[47:07] and you know probably soft-spoken and so
[47:10] everybody that met her even the king's
[47:13] keepers of the concubines and the harems
[47:16] she found favor with them now verse 10
[47:19] esther had not showed her people nor her
[47:22] kingdom for mordecai had charged her
[47:24] that she should show it and now now when
[47:27] you have a peace
[47:29] when you have the kind of peace the
[47:31] bible talks about that passes all
[47:33] understanding you just sit back and you
[47:36] rest
[47:37] and you wait
[47:39] but the bible says that mordecai walked
[47:42] every day before the court of the
[47:44] women's house to know how esther did and
[47:47] what should become of her so he's just
[47:50] walking back and forth he said oh my
[47:52] esther's in there there's a thousand
[47:54] other girls in there and what's going to
[47:56] become of her and you know when's it
[47:58] going to be her time you know
[48:00] he's kind of out of the loop while he's
[48:02] out there everything's going on behind
[48:04] the behind the walls all does he know
[48:06] that esther's in there with all these
[48:08] other ones and there's only going to be
[48:10] one chosen to be the queen
[48:14] now when every maid's turn was come to
[48:16] gwen the king of hospitals after that
[48:18] she had been 12 months according to the
[48:20] manner of women for so were the days of
[48:23] their purification accomplished to win
[48:26] six months with oil of myrrh and six
[48:29] months with sweet odors and with other
[48:31] things for the purifying of the women so
[48:33] again
[48:34] they did not get in a hurry
[48:36] all these women went through a year
[48:39] of getting bubble baths and maybe
[48:41] getting their manicures and their
[48:43] pedicures and you know getting their
[48:45] getting their hair done and conditioned
[48:47] and softened i mean when you got a whole
[48:49] year and and you know and and
[48:52] everything that you want there was
[48:54] nothing held back from these women they
[48:56] could get any treatment that they wanted
[48:59] and you know believe me back in these
[49:01] days a lot of people think you know they
[49:03] they were backroads people this was a
[49:05] sophisticated kingdom
[49:07] in iran
[49:09] persia is modern-day
[49:11] iran
[49:14] now now here's where it gets really
[49:17] really dicey
[49:19] he said thus whenever
[49:22] thus
[49:24] then thus came every maiden under the
[49:26] king whatsoever she desired was given
[49:30] her to go with her out of the house of
[49:33] the women under the king's house
[49:36] now listen this is where
[49:38] reading between the lines it really kind
[49:40] it kind of gives you a spiritual shock
[49:42] sometimes you know when you realize
[49:44] what's going on here says in the evening
[49:47] she went and on the morrow she returned
[49:50] under the second house of the women to
[49:52] the custody of shagaz the king's
[49:56] chamberlain which kept the concubines
[49:59] she came in unto the king no more
[50:03] except the king delighteth in her and
[50:07] that she recalled by name
[50:09] so
[50:10] basically
[50:11] each one of these women
[50:14] they had a one-night stand
[50:17] you know what a one-night stand is you
[50:19] know some drunk people meet out of the
[50:21] bar room or out of the nightclub or
[50:22] something like that and they're either
[50:24] drunk or on drugs or they find each
[50:26] other attractive and they wind up in a
[50:28] hotel somewhere or his house or her
[50:30] house or something and then they wake up
[50:32] the next morning and he looks at her and
[50:34] she looks at him and you know
[50:37] he didn't look so he doesn't look so
[50:38] attractive in the morning as he did when
[50:40] they are out there dancing on the on the
[50:42] dance floor the night before with his
[50:44] hair all slicked back and she doesn't
[50:46] look so good uh her makeup's probably
[50:49] you know running down there and her hair
[50:50] is all frizzed out and so maybe they say
[50:53] hey you know it was nice knowing you but
[50:55] see you later
[50:57] that's a one-night stand and that's what
[50:59] every one of these maidens got they got
[51:01] a one night stand with the king now if
[51:05] the king if the king did not find
[51:08] pleasure in her
[51:09] she became a concubine for the rest of
[51:13] her life
[51:14] so these people were willing they were
[51:16] willing to take that opportunity for one
[51:19] night with the king to impress the king
[51:22] to become the queen
[51:25] but if she didn't do it
[51:28] to the concubines you go
[51:30] and so mordecai had had entered esther
[51:35] into this kind of a beauty contest
[51:38] where there was a thousand women there
[51:40] she had one out of a thousand chance
[51:44] of becoming the queen of a pagan heathen
[51:48] kingdom
[51:49] and if she didn't make it
[51:53] his cousin who he had raised up who was
[51:57] a jew was going to become a pagan
[52:00] heathen concubine for the rest of her
[52:03] life
[52:04] mordecai had to be he was a man of god
[52:08] he was a man of faith and i believe that
[52:11] he was led of god to do what he did he
[52:14] had i believe in my own heart i believe
[52:17] he had thus saith the lord because of
[52:19] the way everything unfolds after that
[52:22] said now when the turn of esther the
[52:25] daughter of abigail the uncle of
[52:27] mordecai who had taken her for the
[52:29] daughter was come to go in unto the king
[52:34] she required
[52:37] nothing
[52:39] but what hagiai the king's chamberlain's
[52:42] the keeper of the women appointed so in
[52:45] other words she didn't need all the
[52:47] lipstick she didn't need all the max
[52:50] factor of their day she didn't need she
[52:52] didn't need a tight you know a tight
[52:54] skirt she didn't need high heels she
[52:57] didn't need all those things she was a
[52:59] radiant beauty
[53:02] and and so she needed nothing other than
[53:05] what the chamberlains and remember the
[53:07] chamberlain there were seven
[53:09] chamberlains and each one of those seven
[53:11] chamberlains had had sacrificed their
[53:14] manhood so they could be trusted in
[53:17] other words they had no seed of their
[53:19] own all as they had was the king's
[53:22] commandments and so these seven
[53:24] chamberlains are a perfect type of the
[53:26] seven church age messenger and the last
[53:29] chamberlain was named was carcass and
[53:30] where the carcasses the eagles will be
[53:33] gathered and mordecai is the little man
[53:36] and esther is the star and esther goes
[53:38] in when esther goes in
[53:42] and the king loved
[53:44] esther above all the women and she
[53:47] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[53:50] more than all the virgins so that he set
[53:52] the royal crown upon her head and made
[53:55] her queen instead of vashti
[53:58] so at this time now another royal
[54:01] proclamation has gone out hey the beauty
[54:04] contest is over
[54:06] all you fair young maidens that have
[54:09] come from far away you can go back to
[54:12] where you came from all you other ones
[54:15] that that came for a one night stand you
[54:17] know enjoy your life as a concubine but
[54:21] i have found my queen and my queen is is
[54:24] esther so now what happens is this
[54:27] proclamation goes out then the king made
[54:30] a great feast unto all his princes and
[54:33] his servants even esther's feasts and he
[54:36] made a release of the province and gave
[54:38] gifts according to the state of the king
[54:42] so so so now here comes another
[54:44] proclamation and the scribes have to
[54:47] come in and they've got to write out the
[54:49] great feasts of esther and the runners
[54:51] and the messengers and the horses and
[54:53] the camels it's again labor intensive
[54:57] time intensive and it goes out and
[55:00] esther's feast
[55:02] is made
[55:04] and when the virgins were gathered
[55:06] together the second time when mordecai
[55:08] sat in the king's gate esther had not
[55:11] showed her kindred nor her people as
[55:13] mordecai had charged her and i loved
[55:16] this part for esther did
[55:19] the commandment of mordecai
[55:22] like as when she was brought up with him
[55:25] so she had absolute confidence in
[55:28] mordecai the little man whatever he said
[55:31] she did it and when she went in to see
[55:34] the king she didn't need anything except
[55:36] what the chamberlains had provided for
[55:39] her and each church age messenger from
[55:42] paul's church church age to iranians to
[55:45] martin to columbus to martin luther to
[55:47] john wesley right up to to our day with
[55:50] william branham each one of the bride of
[55:54] that day who was made queen in that day
[55:57] they needed nothing other than what
[56:00] their church age messenger had given
[56:03] them whatever their whatever their
[56:05] message was for that day they received
[56:08] it and they were brought in and they
[56:10] were made queen
[56:12] each one is is a queen to the king jesus
[56:16] christ for that day and that age
[56:20] now here's some drama in those days when
[56:23] mordecai was in the king's gate two of
[56:25] the king's chamberlain's big tha and
[56:27] teresh of which kept the door where roth
[56:30] and sought to lay hands on the king now
[56:32] just to uh just to preach expository for
[56:35] a little while uh while mordecai was out
[56:38] there and and he's watching and he's
[56:41] waiting and he's looking and listening
[56:44] and he uncovers a plot there's a plot
[56:47] assassination attempt against the king
[56:50] and mordecai finds out he tells esther
[56:53] and esther tells the king and the king
[56:56] has it checked out and if they find out
[56:58] these guys are guilty and they were
[57:00] taken and they were hanged and it was
[57:02] written in the chronicles they didn't
[57:05] have newspapers in those days but they
[57:08] did have every every province had people
[57:11] who wrote whatever outstanding news had
[57:13] taken place in the kingdom they wrote it
[57:16] down and especially everything that
[57:18] happened in the king's court but
[57:21] everything was meticulously wrote down
[57:23] and so they wrote down and mordecai you
[57:26] know he saved the king's life he exposed
[57:28] the plot and they wrote it down and the
[57:31] book was closed and it was put in the
[57:33] closet
[57:36] now we we have a new character enter on
[57:39] the scene
[57:40] and that is haman after those days the
[57:43] king of hospitals promote haman the son
[57:45] of hamadatha the aggite and advanced him
[57:48] and set his seat above all the princes
[57:52] that were with him now
[57:55] this this this next verse shows the kind
[57:58] of power that he had
[58:00] and all the king's servants that were in
[58:02] the king's gate bowed and reverenced
[58:05] haman for the king had so commanded
[58:08] concerning him so everywhere haman went
[58:11] he loved it he was a glory hog and he
[58:15] was decked out all the way and
[58:17] everywhere he went people was oh bow
[58:20] down the great haman is here and haman
[58:23] loved it he just sucked it up you know
[58:26] everywhere he went everybody bowed down
[58:30] and the bible says all
[58:32] everybody
[58:34] bowed down
[58:35] everywhere he is like is you ever see a
[58:38] uh at a football game or a sports game
[58:40] they have what they call the wave you
[58:42] know and and it's like everybody you
[58:44] know they they go through it and it's
[58:46] like a wave sweeping through there well
[58:48] when mordecai
[58:50] i mean when haman come walking through
[58:52] there it was a wave
[58:55] everybody bowing down giving honor and
[58:57] reverence but
[58:59] the bible says mordecai the jew
[59:03] bowed not right he didn't bow
[59:06] he said i'm not going to bend and i'm
[59:08] not going to bow and haman was
[59:11] absolutely
[59:13] furious
[59:15] everybody in the whole kingdom bow
[59:17] wherever he went but mordecai the jew
[59:21] would not bow down
[59:23] before him
[59:25] now we know that
[59:27] that that the somebody who has this kind
[59:29] of a character he's uh egomaniac
[59:33] narcissistic
[59:36] so now here comes the buzz again here
[59:38] comes the gossip and the king's servants
[59:41] which are in the king's gate they said
[59:43] in the mordecai why transgresses thou
[59:46] the king's commandment so that
[59:48] commandment again they had to make a big
[59:50] deal all the scribes came in
[59:53] it was put in motion again that haman
[59:56] was the prime minister and everybody in
[59:58] the whole kingdom when you see him you
[1:00:01] bow down and you give him honor and
[1:00:03] glory and reverence
[1:00:05] so now the men are saying mordecai why
[1:00:08] why are you going against the king's
[1:00:09] commandment
[1:00:10] why are you not going to bow and so now
[1:00:13] they they they bring it up to the king's
[1:00:15] prince and they want to say hey are you
[1:00:18] going to let this stand
[1:00:19] are you going to let this proclamation
[1:00:21] that the king made are you going to let
[1:00:23] this one guy
[1:00:25] defy everything
[1:00:27] that that has been said
[1:00:31] in verse five of chapter
[1:00:33] two three and when haman saw that
[1:00:35] mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence
[1:00:38] then it was haman full of wrath and he
[1:00:40] thought scorn to lay hands on mordeca he
[1:00:45] loved to have grabbed him by the he
[1:00:47] loved to squeeze the life out of him
[1:00:49] he loved to lay hands
[1:00:54] on mordecai
[1:01:02] and he sought to lay hands on mordecai
[1:01:05] alone
[1:01:06] he wanted to do it himself
[1:01:08] he didn't want anybody else to do it
[1:01:11] for they had showed him the people of
[1:01:14] mordecai now here's where we see the
[1:01:17] first time that it was known that
[1:01:20] mordecai was a jew
[1:01:22] it says
[1:01:24] because he had showed him the people of
[1:01:27] mordecai wherefore haman sought to
[1:01:29] destroy all the jews that were
[1:01:31] throughout the whole kingdom of
[1:01:33] ahosaurus even the people of mordecai so
[1:01:36] now they get all the important men they
[1:01:38] probably got the soothsayers and all
[1:01:40] those people and they were trying to
[1:01:42] find what was the perfect date
[1:01:46] to to have the proclamation to go out
[1:01:48] and kill all the jews now this has taken
[1:01:51] place in january and they find out that
[1:01:54] the best date is the 13th date the 13th
[1:01:59] day
[1:02:00] of december so it's the 12th month
[1:02:04] of december so there's a little bit of
[1:02:06] time here between when this where this
[1:02:08] proclamation is going to be made and
[1:02:10] when they actually carry it out to kill
[1:02:13] every jew
[1:02:16] so now haman goes in now you want to
[1:02:18] talk about about guile and deceit
[1:02:21] deception
[1:02:22] and haman said unto a hospital there's a
[1:02:25] certain people scattered abroad and
[1:02:27] dispersed
[1:02:29] throughout and abroad and dispersed
[1:02:31] among the people in all the provinces of
[1:02:33] thy kingdom and their ways are diverse
[1:02:37] from all people neither keep they the
[1:02:40] king's laws
[1:02:42] therefore
[1:02:43] it is not for the king's prophet to
[1:02:46] suffer them now you know there's a
[1:02:49] hundred million people in the kingdom
[1:02:51] approximately we we can't be exact but
[1:02:54] but
[1:02:55] haman goes in and says
[1:02:58] there's a whole group of people here
[1:03:00] and their ways are different their laws
[1:03:02] are different and they're not obeying
[1:03:04] your law actually there was one man
[1:03:08] in the whole kingdom
[1:03:09] there was one man that wasn't bowing
[1:03:11] down
[1:03:12] out of all
[1:03:14] the 127 provinces
[1:03:16] but haman makes it like you know there's
[1:03:18] a whole group of people out there and
[1:03:21] they're a danger they're a danger to
[1:03:24] your kingdom
[1:03:26] he says if it please the king let it be
[1:03:30] written that they may be destroyed and i
[1:03:32] will pay ten thousand talents of silver
[1:03:35] to the hands of those that have the
[1:03:37] charge of this business yeah all the
[1:03:39] hitmen
[1:03:40] all the button men all the guys that go
[1:03:43] out there and kill and assassinate and
[1:03:45] wipe out whoever the king and the king's
[1:03:47] uh princes say to do it so i'm gonna
[1:03:50] give money to the hands of those that
[1:03:53] have the charge of the business to bring
[1:03:56] it unto the king's treasuries and the
[1:03:59] king took his ring from his hands and
[1:04:02] gave it unto haman the son of hamadatha
[1:04:04] the agait the jews enemy
[1:04:08] and the king said unto haman the silver
[1:04:11] he says i don't want your money the
[1:04:13] silver is given to thee the people also
[1:04:16] to do with them as it seemeth good to
[1:04:20] thee in other words hey you're my prime
[1:04:22] minister i trust you you say these
[1:04:25] people are a danger you say they need to
[1:04:27] be wiped out no matter where they are he
[1:04:30] said i'm giving you permission to wipe
[1:04:33] them out you do whatever you think is
[1:04:35] right for them and they signed it and
[1:04:38] the signet ring went down
[1:04:40] and it was made and that law could not
[1:04:43] be altered now
[1:04:44] i think you can guess what happened
[1:04:47] the scribes had to come in
[1:04:49] and everyone had the right and and then
[1:04:52] the runners and the messengers and the
[1:04:54] horses and the cam the whole procedure
[1:04:57] all over again
[1:05:02] then were the king's scribes called on
[1:05:04] the 13th day of the first month and
[1:05:06] there was written according to all that
[1:05:08] haman had commanded unto the king's
[1:05:09] lieutenants and to the governors that
[1:05:11] were over every province and to the
[1:05:13] rulers of every people of uh every
[1:05:16] people of every province according to
[1:05:18] the writing thereof and to every people
[1:05:21] after their language in the name of the
[1:05:22] king of hospitals was a written and
[1:05:24] sealed with the king's ring
[1:05:27] and of course the letters were
[1:05:29] were sent out all over
[1:05:32] unlike in verse 15 it said the post went
[1:05:34] out being hastened by the king in other
[1:05:37] words haman said this is a 9-1-1 project
[1:05:41] this is not a regular this is not a
[1:05:43] regular program he says the scribes you
[1:05:45] better work faster and you runners you
[1:05:48] better run faster you messengers you
[1:05:50] better get the horses and the mules and
[1:05:52] the camels and get them ready and put
[1:05:54] them into high gear
[1:05:56] get your whip ready and just get that
[1:05:58] this is an important proclamation that
[1:06:01] has to go out so the post went out being
[1:06:04] hastened by the king's commandment and
[1:06:06] the decree was given to shush on the
[1:06:08] palace and the king and haman sat down
[1:06:11] to drink
[1:06:13] so they sat down as okay let's have a
[1:06:15] toast
[1:06:16] our enemy and the kingdom are going to
[1:06:19] be wiped out it's been done it's been
[1:06:21] sealed it cannot be changed so on the
[1:06:24] 13th day of december we will not have
[1:06:27] these enemies in our kingdom anymore and
[1:06:29] our kingdom will be safer and a greater
[1:06:31] kingdom
[1:06:32] now when mordecai he finds out all
[1:06:35] that's going on and so he goes before
[1:06:38] the king's gate and he he just rips his
[1:06:41] clothes and he's got sackcloth and ashes
[1:06:44] and he's just gone before and he's
[1:06:46] wailing and moaning and so now esther
[1:06:50] she finds out you know the men down
[1:06:52] there they get word to the people who
[1:06:54] take care of esther and they say hey
[1:06:56] look uh mordecai he's out in front of
[1:06:59] the king's gate and he is making a fool
[1:07:02] out of himself and it's going to come
[1:07:04] back to you esther
[1:07:07] and so she sends clothes and and she
[1:07:10] sends the messengers down there and she
[1:07:12] said mordecai get next to yourself you
[1:07:15] know
[1:07:16] what's wrong with you straighten up you
[1:07:18] know you you can't you can't be acting
[1:07:20] like this so they sent down brand new
[1:07:22] clothes for them and mordecai saw them
[1:07:24] i'm not taking these clothes i'm in
[1:07:27] sackcloth and i'm here for a purpose
[1:07:30] and he sends he sends the the
[1:07:32] proclamation that the jews are going to
[1:07:34] be wiped out he sends the proclamation
[1:07:36] back to esther
[1:07:38] and he said esther
[1:07:40] you've got to do something about this
[1:07:42] he said you got to go in you got to go
[1:07:44] into the king and you've got to show
[1:07:46] your kindred and you've got to save the
[1:07:49] people now esther she was enjoying being
[1:07:51] queen brother wade she was enjoying all
[1:07:54] you know the luxury the beds and and you
[1:07:58] know the clothes she had and the food
[1:08:00] she ate and everywhere she went
[1:08:03] everybody admired her because now she
[1:08:06] was the most beautiful woman in the land
[1:08:09] and she was loving it she was living the
[1:08:12] high life and all of a sudden mordecai
[1:08:15] comes and said you've got to go in and
[1:08:17] you've got to tell the king that you're
[1:08:19] a jew
[1:08:22] remember this is a pagan heathen kingdom
[1:08:26] and a hosters knew nothing about his
[1:08:29] wife being a jew
[1:08:31] and so now esther she says she said hey
[1:08:34] she said i'm not going in there don't
[1:08:36] you know that there is a proclamation
[1:08:39] that's been made that nobody can go in
[1:08:41] to see the king into the inner court
[1:08:44] unless they're invited and if they're
[1:08:48] not invited and they walk in and if the
[1:08:51] king does not hold out the golden
[1:08:53] scepter it's off with their head
[1:08:57] she says and i haven't been invited
[1:09:00] and so i'm not going in
[1:09:03] too dangerous
[1:09:04] i like my head
[1:09:07] and so she sends that back to mordecai
[1:09:10] and mordecai sends a proclamation back
[1:09:13] he said esther how do you know that you
[1:09:15] have not been raised up for such a time
[1:09:18] as this
[1:09:21] and you know he says esther don't if you
[1:09:24] don't go in i love morning he said
[1:09:26] esther if you don't go in
[1:09:29] deliverance will rise up from another
[1:09:32] quarter in other words god has other
[1:09:35] ways to save the people he's given you
[1:09:37] the opportunity he said how do you know
[1:09:40] that you haven't been raised up for such
[1:09:43] a time as this
[1:09:44] and so esther
[1:09:47] god gave her a backbone
[1:09:49] she stiffened up
[1:09:51] she said i've always obeyed mordecai
[1:09:54] i've always trusted mordecai
[1:09:57] i'm gonna do what he says
[1:09:59] and she says call the people
[1:10:01] and have them fast
[1:10:03] and i'm going to go in
[1:10:06] and
[1:10:08] if i perish
[1:10:10] i perish
[1:10:12] if i lose my head i lose my head
[1:10:15] but i'm going to see the king
[1:10:18] and so she got all dressed up put on her
[1:10:21] favorite clothes and she walked in and
[1:10:24] she's probably her knees are probably
[1:10:26] shaking and her heart's probably beaten
[1:10:29] you know probably you know double what
[1:10:31] is normally to beaten and she's trying
[1:10:33] to keep her composure and she does
[1:10:36] what is totally against every law the
[1:10:41] biggest in fact the biggest law is
[1:10:43] nobody can go into the inner court to
[1:10:46] see the king unless they're invited and
[1:10:49] if they're not invited man it's big-time
[1:10:52] trouble
[1:10:53] and so she comes walking in against
[1:10:56] every law and she comes walking in and
[1:10:59] and the king sees her and he says esther
[1:11:03] my queen
[1:11:07] what is it that you want you can have
[1:11:10] anything
[1:11:11] even up to the half of my kingdom so
[1:11:14] esther comes in and she touches the
[1:11:17] golden scepter
[1:11:18] and she knows that that all is okay
[1:11:21] because the king held out the scepter
[1:11:23] and offers her half of the kingdom and
[1:11:26] so she says
[1:11:27] if it please the king i'd like to have a
[1:11:29] feast made and just you and me and haman
[1:11:34] will go in and we'll have a feast
[1:11:37] and so the king says let it be done
[1:11:40] notify haman that that we're going to
[1:11:42] have a feast and it's just myself and my
[1:11:45] queen and haman are going to be there
[1:11:48] now haman the glory hog he's just i mean
[1:11:51] he's just eating it up and he's telling
[1:11:53] all his friends you know not only has
[1:11:55] all this glory been given unto me and
[1:11:58] everything's going my way and now the
[1:12:01] king has invited me in for a banquet and
[1:12:04] it's only going to be him and the queen
[1:12:06] and me i mean things can't get much
[1:12:08] better
[1:12:10] but then he sees
[1:12:12] mordecai the jew
[1:12:14] and mordecai the jew
[1:12:15] he's just sitting there
[1:12:17] in his sackcloth and ashes
[1:12:20] and he ain't to bend and he's not going
[1:12:22] to bow
[1:12:24] so haman he just kind of you know gets
[1:12:26] next to himself and and and he goes on
[1:12:28] his way
[1:12:29] so now plans are are being made plans
[1:12:32] are being formulated for for them to to
[1:12:35] go in
[1:12:37] and so esther now it came to pass on the
[1:12:40] third day that esther put on the royal
[1:12:42] apparel and stood in the inner court of
[1:12:44] the king's house over against uh over
[1:12:47] against the king's house and the king
[1:12:49] sat upon his royal throne in the royal
[1:12:51] house over against the gate of the house
[1:12:54] so when the so and it was so when the
[1:12:57] king saw esther the queen standing in
[1:13:00] the court that she obtained favor in his
[1:13:03] sight and the king held out to esther
[1:13:05] the golden scepter that was in her hand
[1:13:08] so esther drew near and touched the top
[1:13:11] of the scepter
[1:13:13] so now they come in for the banquet
[1:13:16] that esther had asked for
[1:13:18] and then went haman forth that day
[1:13:22] joyful with a glad heart but when haman
[1:13:25] saw mordecai in the king's gate that he
[1:13:28] stood not up nor moved for him he was
[1:13:31] full of wrath and dignity indignation
[1:13:34] against mordecai nevertheless haman
[1:13:37] refrained himself and when he came home
[1:13:39] he sent and called for his friends and
[1:13:42] zarash's wife
[1:13:44] now he tells them he tells him about all
[1:13:46] his glory all the power he's got
[1:13:48] everybody in the kingdom is bowing down
[1:13:51] and giving me honor and giving me homage
[1:13:54] and now even the king i went into the
[1:13:56] banquet last night and now the king has
[1:13:59] asked me to go in for
[1:14:01] another banquet and and he says
[1:14:04] things couldn't get better i mean i i'm
[1:14:06] the most important man in the kingdom
[1:14:09] everybody knows it
[1:14:12] but all these things they don't do me
[1:14:17] one bit of good
[1:14:19] as long as that mordecai the jew that
[1:14:23] little man he won't bow down to me
[1:14:26] and it just it just galls me
[1:14:29] everything it means nothing
[1:14:32] until i get rid of those jews
[1:14:35] so now varash verash is haman's wife now
[1:14:39] i'm sure you figured out that haman is
[1:14:42] the perfect type of the devil
[1:14:45] got all the power get all the pageantry
[1:14:47] everybody's bowing down to him except
[1:14:50] the little man
[1:14:52] mordecai see
[1:14:54] and so now verash and the name varash
[1:14:57] means she who works behind the scenes
[1:15:00] and so varash says well you know what
[1:15:03] what you ought to do is you ought to
[1:15:05] have a gallows made
[1:15:07] 50 cubits high
[1:15:09] now mordechai is a little man and she
[1:15:11] says make a gallows 50 cubits high
[1:15:14] and take take uh mordecai and hang them
[1:15:18] on the gallows and so uh hamos that's a
[1:15:21] great idea and all of his advisors and
[1:15:23] all the men they all agreed that's the
[1:15:25] way to go that's the way to go now
[1:15:29] he's getting ready to go in and and make
[1:15:31] this proposal that he can hang mordecai
[1:15:35] before he can kill this jew before
[1:15:38] december the 13th
[1:15:41] so now that night the king is tossing
[1:15:43] and turning and tossing and turning
[1:15:45] because god is shaking them and shaking
[1:15:47] them and you you're not going you're not
[1:15:49] going to sleep tonight king
[1:15:51] i i got something that you need to see
[1:15:54] and so the king couldn't sleep and so he
[1:15:56] wakes up and he says he says well
[1:15:59] have the scribes come in and have them
[1:16:01] read me what's going on in my kingdom
[1:16:04] lately and so they're reading and
[1:16:06] reading and reading and they say and
[1:16:08] mordecai the jew
[1:16:10] uncovered the plot against the king and
[1:16:13] the king was saved and the men were
[1:16:15] found guilty and they were hanged and he
[1:16:18] kept start of the glory and the king
[1:16:19] said wait a minute
[1:16:22] what did we do to mordecai the jew to
[1:16:25] reward him
[1:16:27] for what he did
[1:16:29] and they said well
[1:16:31] nothing
[1:16:33] nothing was done no reward was given to
[1:16:35] him nothing
[1:16:36] and the king said you know who who's out
[1:16:39] in the who's out in the court out there
[1:16:41] i need one of my one of my noble men and
[1:16:44] so here comes haman haman's coming in to
[1:16:47] get the king to sign doc the the
[1:16:49] document and to have him seal it on his
[1:16:52] ring that he can take mordecai and hang
[1:16:55] him on the gallows 50 cubits high
[1:16:57] and so here he comes he he's a man on a
[1:17:00] mission
[1:17:01] he's like a heat-seeking missile he is
[1:17:04] bound and determined that he's going to
[1:17:06] wipe out this guy once and for all and
[1:17:09] the king said he said uh he said heyman
[1:17:11] i'm glad you're here i got a question
[1:17:14] for you
[1:17:14] he said here's my question he said what
[1:17:17] should be done
[1:17:19] to the man
[1:17:21] that the king
[1:17:22] desires to honor
[1:17:25] and mordechai said well you know
[1:17:28] who would the king who would the king
[1:17:30] more want to honor than myself
[1:17:33] i mean you know he's given me everything
[1:17:36] he's probably just want to pile on a
[1:17:38] little more honor he's pleased with the
[1:17:39] way things are going
[1:17:41] everybody's bowing down except mordecai
[1:17:44] the jew but you know i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:17:47] fix that up so so he says now what
[1:17:49] should be done to the man the king
[1:17:51] desires to honor
[1:17:53] and haman said oh king
[1:17:56] probably put on his humble his humble
[1:17:59] act he said o king to the man that you
[1:18:02] desire to honor
[1:18:04] he said
[1:18:05] let the horse
[1:18:06] your horse
[1:18:08] let it be brought
[1:18:09] and let the clothes the royal clothes
[1:18:12] that used to wear let them be put upon
[1:18:14] that man
[1:18:16] and let the crown royal be placed upon
[1:18:19] his head
[1:18:20] and then
[1:18:22] have one of your most noble men come and
[1:18:26] put that man on the horse and have a
[1:18:29] celebration a big parade
[1:18:32] the whole kingdom of shushan the palace
[1:18:36] should know
[1:18:38] that you want to honor this man and the
[1:18:40] king said
[1:18:41] he said haman
[1:18:43] you're a genius
[1:18:46] i love that idea
[1:18:48] he said everything that you have said he
[1:18:51] said don't hesitate don't just make
[1:18:55] haste do everything that you just told
[1:18:58] me to mordecai the jew
[1:19:04] i mean you know if he didn't have a
[1:19:06] strong heart he probably would have gone
[1:19:08] over right then
[1:19:09] he's there to hang him
[1:19:12] he's there to hang him and the king is
[1:19:14] going to have him honor him
[1:19:16] so now he has to go it was his idea
[1:19:19] and and the king has told them i want
[1:19:21] you to do it i want you to honor him so
[1:19:24] he goes and gets the horse gets the
[1:19:26] clothes gets the crown and he gets he
[1:19:28] gets mordecai and he went through the
[1:19:31] kingdom now you know he was expecting to
[1:19:33] be on the horse
[1:19:35] and he was expecting somebody to be
[1:19:36] saying thus shall it be done to the man
[1:19:40] the king desires to honor
[1:19:43] but instead he said
[1:19:46] thus shall it be done
[1:19:48] to the man the king desires to honor
[1:19:51] thus shall it be done to the man the
[1:19:53] king desires to honor and when it was
[1:19:55] all over mordecai goes back sackcloth
[1:19:58] and ashes and here goes haman he goes
[1:20:01] back
[1:20:02] and he says he said their ash and all
[1:20:04] this advice he said you won't believe
[1:20:06] what happened i went there to get the
[1:20:08] document ready to hang mordecai 50
[1:20:11] cubits high on the gallows and i got
[1:20:13] tricked he said somehow that mordecai
[1:20:16] has found favor with the king and i had
[1:20:19] to go i had to get them all decked out
[1:20:21] had to bring them through town
[1:20:23] he said my he said he said everything is
[1:20:25] going sideways
[1:20:27] and varash says well
[1:20:30] he said now she's the one who helped
[1:20:31] plan
[1:20:33] to hang mordecai and she said well you
[1:20:34] know look honey
[1:20:36] if the king
[1:20:38] has desire to honor
[1:20:40] the man that you've decided to come
[1:20:43] against you're in big trouble
[1:20:47] and so he's sitting there contemplating
[1:20:49] it and here comes the man says amen it's
[1:20:52] time for the for the feast and so he
[1:20:54] said well you know at least i got the
[1:20:56] feast to go to
[1:20:57] and so he goes there and he probably got
[1:21:00] there with the king he probably slugged
[1:21:03] back a few you know just to maybe calm
[1:21:05] himself down
[1:21:07] and you know forget about the day's
[1:21:09] events
[1:21:10] and now the king's there
[1:21:12] and here comes esther
[1:21:15] all decked out all beautiful
[1:21:18] and the king for the third time now the
[1:21:20] king says esther
[1:21:23] my queen
[1:21:25] what is it that you want even up to the
[1:21:27] half of my kingdom
[1:21:29] and esther says if it pleased the king
[1:21:32] he said i'm here i'm interceding for my
[1:21:34] people for we are sold we're going to be
[1:21:37] killed as a proclamation gone out
[1:21:40] and the king you could imagine the king
[1:21:43] somebody's saying somebody's out to get
[1:21:46] your queen and out to get all these
[1:21:48] people
[1:21:50] and the king says
[1:21:52] who
[1:21:54] is he
[1:21:57] and where
[1:21:59] is he
[1:22:00] that would dare come against my queen
[1:22:04] and her people
[1:22:06] and esther says
[1:22:08] he said the culprit
[1:22:10] is that wicked haman
[1:22:12] sitting right there
[1:22:14] right there
[1:22:17] now the king is shocked
[1:22:19] this right-hand man
[1:22:22] remember lucifer was the right-hand man
[1:22:24] once
[1:22:26] and he led a rebellion led a third of
[1:22:28] the angels away so now the bible said
[1:22:30] now the king he he goes out to the
[1:22:32] palace court maybe they had a little
[1:22:34] garden court out there and he's probably
[1:22:36] going out there trying to compose
[1:22:38] himself because he's shocked stunned
[1:22:40] staggered at this proclamation that has
[1:22:43] gone out
[1:22:44] against his queen and her people
[1:22:47] and so now
[1:22:49] haman he knows that his goose is cooked
[1:22:53] and now he's there and he he's esther
[1:22:56] esther please esther please have mercy
[1:22:59] on me no i didn't mean esther i didn't
[1:23:01] mean it for you and now so the king the
[1:23:05] king comes walking in and all as he can
[1:23:07] see is haman pawing at the queen he's
[1:23:10] down there he's pawing at the queen and
[1:23:12] so the king says what's he trying to do
[1:23:16] is he gonna take her right here in my
[1:23:18] court and the men came forward and they
[1:23:21] said behold the gallows
[1:23:24] 50 cubits high
[1:23:27] that that haman has built to hang
[1:23:30] mordecai and the king said take him out
[1:23:33] and hang him on his own gallows
[1:23:36] oh my
[1:23:38] so now just in conclusion esther comes
[1:23:41] and again she makes a proclamation or
[1:23:44] makes a request that this proclamation
[1:23:47] for the jews to be killed you know
[1:23:49] reverse it
[1:23:50] king said i can't do it right when i
[1:23:53] make one of those proclamations
[1:23:55] it is
[1:23:56] it's sealed cannot be changed
[1:24:00] he said but what i can do
[1:24:03] i can make a new proclamation
[1:24:06] and i can make a new date
[1:24:08] and that proclamation will say
[1:24:11] anybody
[1:24:13] who was plotting
[1:24:15] and planning
[1:24:16] against the jews there was a lot of
[1:24:19] activity going on there
[1:24:21] you know because those people were told
[1:24:24] that whatever jew you kill
[1:24:26] you can keep his property
[1:24:29] keep all his goods
[1:24:31] they were going around there and say
[1:24:32] well what jew has the most wealth
[1:24:35] what jew has the biggest house
[1:24:38] you know and they were trying to
[1:24:39] pinpoint that and no doubt there was a
[1:24:41] lot of scorn
[1:24:43] during this time and they probably say
[1:24:46] listen jew
[1:24:48] your days are numbered
[1:24:50] we're going to get you and so the jews
[1:24:53] they were all you know shaken up about
[1:24:55] this and they knew they pretty much knew
[1:24:57] who their enemies were and who was
[1:25:00] plotted and this plot was in 127
[1:25:03] provinces scattered around about 100
[1:25:05] million people
[1:25:07] and so the king he makes a new decree
[1:25:10] and the date is set
[1:25:12] and on that date
[1:25:14] all the jews were permitted to go out
[1:25:19] against any of their enemies
[1:25:21] and just in one in one day seventy five
[1:25:25] 000 were killed
[1:25:26] in one day enemies of the jews then in
[1:25:29] shush on the palace they had another
[1:25:31] wipeout of all the people and these were
[1:25:34] province i mean i mean the princes of
[1:25:36] the provinces especially close to the
[1:25:39] king right there in shushan and they
[1:25:42] were wiped out and they took they took
[1:25:45] haman and his ten songs and they hang
[1:25:48] them on the gallows
[1:25:50] and they took the ring that haman used
[1:25:52] to wear and they put it on mordecai's
[1:25:55] finger and mordecai he was given all the
[1:25:59] property of haman
[1:26:01] and and he grew more he grew more and
[1:26:04] more powerful and the jews became more
[1:26:08] and more accepted and they had a they
[1:26:11] had a a special place in the king's
[1:26:14] heart because his wife
[1:26:16] was a jew
[1:26:18] i can tell you just now just a real
[1:26:20] quick conclusion friends
[1:26:22] this book
[1:26:24] god's not mentioned
[1:26:25] prayer is not mentioned
[1:26:27] but
[1:26:28] god's hand
[1:26:30] god's supernatural hand is all through
[1:26:33] that book
[1:26:35] from the king
[1:26:36] from the queen
[1:26:38] the one who wouldn't come in that is now
[1:26:40] the world council of churches
[1:26:43] and vashti the fair young virgin
[1:26:46] i mean esther the fur young virgin who
[1:26:48] was educated by mordecai she's brought
[1:26:52] in
[1:26:53] she's made queen instead of esther
[1:26:55] because she followed everything the
[1:26:58] little man told her when she went in to
[1:27:00] see the king she need nothing but what
[1:27:02] the seven chamberlains ordered and she
[1:27:05] was made the queen and she was able to
[1:27:08] intercede for her people and save about
[1:27:11] 15 million jews that were in that
[1:27:14] province all through the provinces that
[1:27:16] day
[1:27:17] and now
[1:27:19] every
[1:27:21] every year it's marks 13 and 14 is the
[1:27:25] feast of purim
[1:27:26] it's a jewish feast
[1:27:29] and they celebrate and they come to the
[1:27:31] temple and they read they read the
[1:27:33] entire book of esther to the
[1:27:35] congregation and they're all dressed up
[1:27:38] it's like a costume a costume party and
[1:27:41] they get dressed up with their finest
[1:27:43] clothes
[1:27:45] and they read the whole book
[1:27:47] and every time the rabbi he says
[1:27:50] every time he says esther hey
[1:27:53] esther
[1:27:55] hey esther
[1:27:57] and every time the the the rabbi says
[1:28:00] mordecai oh mordecai
[1:28:02] hey
[1:28:03] mordecai
[1:28:05] and every time he says haman they say
[1:28:07] boo
[1:28:09] boo haman
[1:28:10] boo
[1:28:11] boo
[1:28:13] and they exchange gifts they have a
[1:28:15] celebration it's a party it's a day of
[1:28:18] deliverance for them
