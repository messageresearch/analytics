[22:59] amen let's read Revelations 1:10 I was
[23:01] in the spirit on the Lord's Day heard
[23:02] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[23:04] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[23:06] and the last what thou seest write in a
[23:08] book and send it to the seven churches
[23:10] which are in Asia Ephesus smrna pergamus
[23:13] thra Sardis Philadelphia is where we're
[23:15] in now and Lea and I turned to see the
[23:19] voice that spake with me and be turned I
[23:21] saw seven golden candlesticks let me ask
[23:23] you a question did anybody ever heard an
[23:25] audible voice and know that it was God
[23:30] you don't have to raise your hand but
[23:31] just think about it I mean we have this
[23:33] inward voice that speaks to us you know
[23:35] sometimes we call it a conscience
[23:36] sometimes it's the
[23:38] devil CU if he tells you something and
[23:40] it goes wrong it ain't God that's but
[23:42] you get that little still Small Voice
[23:43] that says hey don't do that or hey do
[23:46] this God don't have to do that folk he
[23:49] does it CU he loves you he does it cuz
[23:52] he knows you're going to make a mistake
[23:54] if you don't do it his way remember
[23:56] God's knows are the best yeses you'll
[23:57] ever get
[23:59] right so John saw that heard a voice
[24:02] that spake with him and being turned I
[24:04] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[24:06] midst of the seven candlesticks one
[24:08] likened the son of man clothed with a
[24:09] garment down to the foot and G about to
[24:11] PPS with a golden girdle Revelations 3
[24:14] verse 7 to the angel of the church in
[24:16] Philadelphia write these things sayith
[24:18] he that is Holy he that is true he that
[24:20] ha the key of David openeth and no man
[24:22] shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth
[24:25] I Know Thy Works behold I have set
[24:27] before thee an Open Door
[24:28] and no man can shut it for thou Hast a
[24:30] little strength and Hast kept my word
[24:32] and Hast not denied my name behold I
[24:35] will make them of the synagogue of Satan
[24:37] which say they are Jews and are not but
[24:39] do lie behold I will make them to come
[24:41] and worship before thy feet and to know
[24:44] that I have loved thee we'll continue on
[24:45] a little bit later we'll cover that in a
[24:47] little bit you may be seated Lord add
[24:49] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[24:50] amen now as we see in the chart we know
[24:53] that that we're in the church age of 1 2
[24:56] 3 4 5 6 and that would be the
[24:59] Philadelphia age from 1750 to 1906 John
[25:02] Wesley came remember now John Wesley
[25:04] comes each messenger comes at the end of
[25:07] the previous age all right you see that
[25:09] there Luther come at the end of col the
[25:12] end of Columbus time to bring his
[25:14] message Wesley come at the end of Luther
[25:18] to bring his message he he brought it in
[25:20] the
[25:21] 1700s and passed away in the 1700s and
[25:24] then there's 1800s and 1900s that They
[25:27] carried on the message of John Wesley so
[25:31] we know that these ages lap over now
[25:34] remember though you and I as the bride
[25:37] in the end time we get all of the
[25:38] blessings and we get all of the curses
[25:42] all right so we get all of them you read
[25:43] that Revelations 1 2 and 3 that's us
[25:46] that's to the bride now we caught up in
[25:48] Revelations 4:1 and then we know that's
[25:51] to the Jews and we'll cover that when we
[25:53] cover some of the major doctrines of
[25:55] that that brother Brandon preached in
[25:57] and the L toy for the Church age
[26:00] so the church is a dominating female we
[26:03] know that we know that we do not that's
[26:06] why and and I was thinking about this
[26:08] yesterday brother
[26:10] brandham he was not
[26:12] against women that were
[26:15] right I had a minister asked me one time
[26:18] actually one that's not in the message
[26:19] anymore he said why did Brother Ram call
[26:21] women
[26:23] dogmate I said brother I said if you're
[26:25] not born again you're dogmate
[26:30] we're worthless if you're not born again
[26:31] you're worthless just Canon F brother
[26:33] didn't brother say Canon F just go right
[26:36] back to ashes just go right back to
[26:38] gases and you're no more so we all are
[26:41] but he was talking about a vile woman
[26:43] cuz he knew a vile woman would take you
[26:45] further remember what he said he said
[26:48] there' be more people in hell because of
[26:50] looking at a pretty woman and lusting
[26:51] after than the would any bar room in the
[26:54] whole country amen well you like it if
[26:57] you want to or not but we we got to do
[26:58] that with the church too we got to
[27:00] understand that we are the bride God has
[27:02] instilled in us to be not the head but
[27:05] part of the head and we got to
[27:07] understand too that that I was talking
[27:09] to to brother Chris yesterday or day
[27:11] before yesterday and you got to remember
[27:13] one thing once we get into this message
[27:16] of of the L of sin message with brother
[27:18] brandham that is The Headstone message
[27:20] someone ask us where is The Headstone
[27:22] it's in the bride it is the bride okay
[27:26] but he has instilled that upon us us
[27:29] that we're going to be the fullness of
[27:30] the godhead bodily we're going to be
[27:32] instilled with all these great things
[27:34] that the Lord Jesus himself is was who
[27:36] the son of
[27:37] man so now where is that son of man it's
[27:40] inside of you in human flesh so that
[27:42] makes you the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[27:45] part of The Headstone yes because
[27:47] remember man and woman is one God and
[27:50] man are one not two one but we know our
[27:54] position we know our place we're all
[27:56] feminist in the body of Christ we not
[27:58] want to user authority over the Lord
[28:00] Jesus you'll never make it and that's
[28:04] what happened in these Church ages they
[28:05] arship their authority over God and his
[28:10] word so that makes you what anti- word
[28:13] or anti- Christ all right so be careful
[28:16] with that let's not let's not Ur up
[28:18] authority over anybody let's be under
[28:21] the headship of Jesus Christ let's be
[28:23] under the headship of the
[28:25] message and accept that you sisters
[28:29] praise God you don't have to preach and
[28:31] you're not required what we're required
[28:33] to
[28:34] do amen you're not to be a doorstep or a
[28:38] door mat and you're not supposed to stay
[28:39] barefoot and pregnant all the time I
[28:40] know that's all what people said all the
[28:42] time but you have a job to
[28:45] do okay there is a fine line there you
[28:47] do have a job to do you know what the
[28:49] greatest job you can have is support
[28:52] your husband or your brothers or your
[28:55] ministry or your church support just
[28:58] really simple you don't have to study
[29:00] for a 4H hour message like I did
[29:02] today but you still need to study you
[29:05] still need to read your Bible you still
[29:07] need to be able to say Amen you still
[29:09] need to be able to know what you said
[29:11] when you say
[29:13] Amen there's a big difference
[29:16] there but that's your that's us and then
[29:18] we're to be submissive to the Lord and
[29:20] then he tells us what to do and we just
[29:22] do it he saids this is your
[29:24] responsibility you do it well what
[29:26] happened in the church ages when the
[29:28] ministry the true Ministry was loosed
[29:30] and it went out in power there was an
[29:33] opposition behind it there was another
[29:35] Ministry loosed that wanted to what
[29:37] Satan's what Satan want to
[29:39] do he don't want he wants to be above
[29:42] God he wants to be as God remember
[29:45] sitting in the temple but he wants to be
[29:48] God that's what gets him all the time
[29:50] you know like I said before I can just
[29:51] see God out in the middle of nowhere and
[29:53] he created Satan first so it was just
[29:56] him and him him and Satan or him and
[29:58] Lucifer right and then the Angels but
[30:02] now Lucifer had a
[30:04] position right he was the worship Angel
[30:07] he was
[30:09] perfect that's what the Bible says what
[30:11] God Said I made you perfect but he said
[30:15] I created you perfect God is not a
[30:18] Creator creation he's a Creator
[30:21] absolutely Satan is a creation and here
[30:23] goes God he says Let There Be and outo
[30:25] something out of nothing just goes
[30:29] and the devil being anointed and being a
[30:31] worship Angel he's like can I do that
[30:33] can I do that can I do that he said no
[30:35] stay in your place I'll do the creating
[30:38] you do the anointing and you do the
[30:40] worshiping and you you just anoint good
[30:43] anointing what I'm doing and then he'll
[30:44] make something else he go oh let let me
[30:46] do that let me do that what H what
[30:48] happened was the Bible says iniquity was
[30:50] found in his what in his
[30:52] heart what was iniquity knowing to do
[30:54] better or not doing it knowing he
[30:56] shouldn't do it he wanted to he wanted
[30:58] to so he goes to his angels and he says
[31:01] Hey I want to tell you something I think
[31:02] I can do a better job than that guy
[31:04] can and he sold them out you think boy
[31:06] that's kind of stupid no he sold a bunch
[31:08] of them
[31:09] out cuz he was smooth and Slick all
[31:13] right so that's who we've got to deal
[31:14] with when there's a Ministry loosed
[31:16] there's got to be opposition behind it
[31:18] remember what brother Brown said he said
[31:20] when the healing campaign hit the road
[31:21] he said hear everybody come in oil in
[31:24] the hand they started praying for the
[31:25] sick they started doing all the prayer
[31:27] lines and all these things right he said
[31:32] carnal impersonators right cuz they had
[31:35] oil in their hands and all this stuff
[31:37] and if they would have just stayed
[31:39] simple brother Brown stayed simple he
[31:41] didn't try to complicate it he had a
[31:44] Healing Ministry and that was it at that
[31:46] time and everybody wanted to you know
[31:48] like brother Brown said he said you know
[31:50] your man's got the ball and you trying
[31:53] to tackle him well are we trying to do
[31:55] the same thing are we trying to just but
[31:58] are we trying to say oh brother Don's
[32:00] got the ball and I don't want him to
[32:01] have it I want to have it we're on the
[32:02] same
[32:04] team that'd be kind of funny to be
[32:06] watching the football game and watch the
[32:07] guy at quarterback throw the ball to the
[32:09] receiver and his own man tackle him and
[32:12] The Field's wide open well that's what
[32:13] we're
[32:14] doing we need to be
[32:16] careful really
[32:21] careful cuz there's opposition there's
[32:23] two Ministries that was loosed right
[32:26] that was the real and the opposing Force
[32:29] now remember they getting closer
[32:31] together though as we come to the end
[32:32] time cuz his anointing as I was saying
[32:35] yet this morning at end of the service
[32:37] Satan is watching
[32:38] us and being
[32:41] religious he comes to our
[32:46] services and he's listening and he's
[32:49] seeing that we're coming to a
[32:51] Perfection that he can't attain to but
[32:54] listen he can
[32:55] pervert what we're coming to
[32:58] cuz remember when we leave this place
[33:00] guess what Satan is going to Incarnate a
[33:01] man and that's going to be God God of
[33:04] this evil age that's going to be the god
[33:06] of the people there's going to be signs
[33:08] wonders Miracles Fire coming out of his
[33:10] mouth maybe not so much fire but we know
[33:11] what it is it's
[33:13] words and he can actually do things
[33:16] brother R said Satan can pass out
[33:17] Supernatural gifts that's right so
[33:20] there'll be a lot of Supernatural going
[33:21] on and the whole world's going to just
[33:22] fall for it just like with this thing
[33:25] that happened yesterday
[33:28] there's a somebody sent a a message on
[33:32] uh one of the social media and had a had
[33:35] a an angel thank God it was a man but
[33:38] had an angel hovering over Trump
[33:40] standing at the podium you know and and
[33:43] knocking the bullets out of the
[33:45] way you just wait this world is waiting
[33:48] for somebody to get them out of this and
[33:51] they'll get their Superman I don't know
[33:53] if it's going to be Donald Trump but
[33:54] they going to get him out of from
[33:55] somewhere that's the world's looking for
[33:58] that and it's just like brother Mike
[34:00] said and it it's
[34:01] true Constantine was the world
[34:04] Superman everybody loved him man they he
[34:07] put church and state together he did all
[34:10] this he was the biggest deceiver there
[34:12] ever was brother B said that's where
[34:14] they made their fatal mistake was when
[34:16] church and state came together when
[34:18] Jezebel and Ahab married each other so
[34:22] that what we think is going to be really
[34:25] nice it may be our downfall it may be
[34:28] what carries this thing really I mean
[34:31] forward you talk about if Trump would
[34:33] have died yesterday there'd have been a
[34:35] civil war there' hadd been people
[34:36] shooting
[34:39] people it almost happened at the White
[34:41] House four years
[34:43] ago
[34:45] amen I know that's politics but just be
[34:47] careful just watch let's not get caught
[34:49] up in the in the let's not get caught up
[34:52] in the um
[34:55] glamour it's all run by the devil
[34:59] every man doesn't matter if it's Biden
[35:00] or Trump or whoever it is it's all run
[35:02] by the devil they are not born again
[35:04] Christians but they can profess they are
[35:06] as Constantine
[35:08] did he said I'm doing this for what for
[35:11] God I'm doing this to get the religion
[35:13] back together to get us all one well
[35:16] that's the
[35:17] devil but I will restore sayeth the
[35:20] Lord and we are part of that that's what
[35:23] I'm trying to get to we are the
[35:26] restoration process toward the very end
[35:29] where that seed that went in the ground
[35:31] who died there 2,000 years ago who died
[35:35] the son of man God can't die the Son of
[35:39] God can't die the son of man died so he
[35:43] went into the ground come back into the
[35:46] Son of God dispensation but brother B
[35:49] said right at the end that son of man is
[35:52] going to the full seed grain is going to
[35:54] come back in power and I just truly
[35:56] believe it it's got to be it's going to
[35:58] be and you and I if we want to be a part
[36:00] of it we've got to
[36:03] go I just say go you want you go just go
[36:06] we got to
[36:09] go so the first three ages had the pure
[36:11] word of God the fourth one in the ground
[36:13] now not that they didn't have the word
[36:15] of God they didn't have all the word of
[36:16] God neither did Luther or Wesley they
[36:20] didn't have all the word of God put
[36:23] together but in the end time
[36:25] today the words should be back together
[36:29] and putting the word back together puts
[36:30] a word back in power to know that we
[36:33] have to go through justification we have
[36:36] to go through sanctification we have to
[36:38] know that we're born again it's not just
[36:40] where this great seed and we always just
[36:42] was and just one day it popped open and
[36:44] here I am no it's a process it's a birth
[36:48] a birth it's never changed the Bible's
[36:50] never changed Jesus said you must be
[36:53] born again and you know it was so real
[36:56] to Nicodemus though he went back to the
[36:59] Natural side and said must I go back in
[37:01] my mother's womb what and come back out
[37:04] water blood and life Jesus said no you
[37:08] got to be born from above by water blood
[37:11] and life justification sanctification
[37:13] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we
[37:15] know who went in the ground we know the
[37:17] son of man went in the ground there what
[37:19] went in the ground here at Nia was a
[37:22] portion of that but it's continued on to
[37:24] where now you got the full grain with me
[37:26] and you over on this
[37:28] side because these guys were reformers
[37:31] brother randam couldn't come as a
[37:33] reformer now he stood on their platform
[37:36] because they did start the reformation
[37:38] and they did start part of the
[37:40] restoration is everybody with me on that
[37:42] brother B didn't fully just come on the
[37:44] scene and restore
[37:46] everything no the just shall live by
[37:48] faith was restored by Luther he had a
[37:51] message the just the the sanctification
[37:54] process John Wesley the Pentecost with
[37:56] the gifts speaking in tongues bringing
[37:58] the gift brother R said the Holy Ghost
[38:00] came himself to give the gifts back to
[38:01] the church then brother rham comes and
[38:04] brings the word of God pure and
[38:06] unadulterated and now that's what we're
[38:08] living in now yes all right so they were
[38:11] we were not
[38:12] reformed remember what I said about
[38:14] reformed they can reform you but if
[38:17] you're once alcoholic you'll always be
[38:19] one in AA and all the different things
[38:21] but we believe in what we believe in
[38:23] restoration restoring back to where you
[38:25] never did that in the first place am I
[38:28] listen to Brother Richard the other day
[38:29] when he preached our ordination
[38:33] service he said that man is here to take
[38:35] us back across that
[38:38] Chasm to put us back in the Garden of
[38:40] Eden remember brother Ram said
[38:42] three-fold purpose all God was he poured
[38:44] into Christ all Christ into who the
[38:45] church take her back to the Garden of
[38:48] Eden now if he takes her back to the
[38:50] Garden of Eden before there was a fall
[38:53] that's where you and I need to be
[38:54] standing at and that's what this message
[38:56] did it takes us back to what that
[38:59] Genesis 1 126 man had there not been a
[39:01] fall we realize now yes I realize now I
[39:05] always was
[39:06] eternal I always was with God or I never
[39:09] was he can't change his
[39:12] mind but I had to come here to receive
[39:14] it when I come through the my mother's
[39:16] womb I was lost when I came through a
[39:19] natural womb you were
[39:22] lost no hope done
[39:30] you didn't have God in you nowhere cuz
[39:32] God won't dwell in an unclean vessel now
[39:34] he listen he followed you all your
[39:37] life he follows you all your life yeah I
[39:39] believe there's an angel hovered over
[39:41] you if you're a born again Christian
[39:42] brother B said we got
[39:43] Angel and then some of us it's
[39:47] plural well I'm one of them
[39:50] so brother John they got Round the Clock
[39:53] shifts on me
[39:58] and I've always thought you know one
[39:59] brother BR said one wormwood could
[40:01] destroy the whole world with
[40:03] water I need one to kind around me to
[40:05] destroy all them demons at one
[40:08] time oh we don't believe in
[40:11] angels oh we don't believe in spirit oh
[40:14] okay well good
[40:18] Baptist listen I believe there's a
[40:20] battle going on all the time we just
[40:23] can't see
[40:24] it the Devil Wants You Dead
[40:28] every second of your day and especially
[40:31] when you get a revelation that he can't
[40:34] get I told y all that the other week
[40:36] that's the difference in Satan and us we
[40:38] are created what I'm looking at right
[40:40] now but in the image of God in Genesis 1
[40:43] that was before the devil the devil
[40:46] can't get eternal life so when you get
[40:48] eternal life in your soul Satan it's
[40:50] hard for him to realize he can't get in
[40:53] there anymore and it makes him mad
[40:57] am he's the author of being
[40:59] mad that's right but we got to start in
[41:03] the process so the last three Church
[41:06] Ages which would be we need to get a
[41:09] church ages one like that so we can I
[41:12] keep looking for one and there's not one
[41:14] popping up over here anywhere you know
[41:16] what what I just showed the church
[41:20] ages so the last
[41:23] three ages completes the birth that we
[41:26] are that we realize every by brother
[41:29] br's saying that for us he's not saying
[41:31] that for those other people they're gone
[41:33] they're dead he's saying it for live
[41:36] people this ministry is for live people
[41:38] absolutely so we're alive now so we got
[41:40] to be justified and he shows and looks
[41:42] back to Martin Luther and he says the
[41:44] just shall live by faith you got to have
[41:46] faith to know that this right here that
[41:49] God eradicates by faith in what Christ
[41:51] did at the cross the sins of your past
[41:54] nature do you really believe that if you
[41:56] don't then and there is got to be a time
[41:58] where you got to believe it you can't
[42:00] get born again without believing that
[42:02] God has eradicated not hid or
[42:06] covered
[42:08] eradicated and he can't even find them
[42:11] anymore Satan can't find them anymore
[42:13] God can't even find them anymore cuz he
[42:16] set up a place if he's a Creator Bob he
[42:19] going to have a place he created that
[42:24] sea he created that sea of forgetfulness
[42:27] just so he could throw your sins in it
[42:30] and he can't even get to it what sins
[42:32] you talking
[42:34] about see he gets that all the time the
[42:36] devil says can't you see that he's
[42:39] like I just hear their voice saying
[42:41] forgive me Lord amen I hear the voice
[42:44] saying Lord I'm sorry I did that I'll
[42:46] try not to do it again Lord forgive
[42:49] me they like well I saw him do it he
[42:51] said I
[42:53] didn't so who's the most righteous God's
[42:56] the most righteous Satan's a liar God
[42:58] knows that that's right he pull over
[43:01] nothing over on on the Lord no sir so
[43:03] being justified freely by his grace
[43:05] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[43:07] Jesus whom God has set forth as a
[43:10] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[43:12] not cow's blood or horses blood or or
[43:15] the blood of bulls and goats and all
[43:16] those different things that what covered
[43:19] if you look in the Bible that word means
[43:21] Capo there's a there's a covering but
[43:23] it's still there this is your sin
[43:27] it covered the sins of those people in
[43:29] the Old Testament until Jesus Christ
[43:31] come and then that blood left and then
[43:33] the blood of Jesus Christ covered all
[43:35] that everybody with me now you got your
[43:38] sins that you started with and you come
[43:40] down through here time and you ask God
[43:42] to truly forgive you of your past guess
[43:46] what
[43:48] gone not covered Hallelujah not maybe no
[43:52] he's the just and the justifier he's the
[43:55] only one that can clean us up listen
[43:57] don't try to clean yourself
[44:02] up that's right ask God to clean you
[44:05] up we're not strong enough even born
[44:09] again people we're not strong enough all
[44:12] together to be able to fight the devil
[44:14] brother R said we're not even a match
[44:16] for
[44:17] it but we do have somebody an
[44:21] advocate a high priest that's already
[44:23] went in for us I know this is simple
[44:26] salvation but some needs it we need to
[44:29] get born again and we need to do it
[44:31] right we need to be justified and know
[44:33] that we're Justified Sanctified and know
[44:35] that we're Sanctified and then get the
[44:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[44:39] not just a covering but in your soul to
[44:43] burn the old you out to make you a new
[44:46] creature in Christ or a new creation
[44:49] only God can
[44:52] create Satan can cover that and pervert
[44:54] it but he never can he couldn't create
[44:56] it God created ever soul that ever was
[44:58] on the face of this Earth past and
[45:01] present but what does he do he gives us
[45:03] a
[45:05] choice a willing person as we read this
[45:08] morning somebody willing to give
[45:12] up Abraham you're 99 years old he said
[45:16] God I know it he said I'm done I give up
[45:18] I've been trying to do this thing for
[45:20] you I've been trying to do this thing
[45:22] for you and God said Abraham that's
[45:25] where you should have started at
[45:27] but remember he knows we're human and we
[45:29] try to help
[45:31] God let go and let God okay now that
[45:37] doesn't mean go sit down in your chair
[45:40] and a week later you're still sitting
[45:42] there no remember what I said about
[45:45] getting a job you pray to get a job why
[45:48] a't you got a job well I'm just waiting
[45:49] on God to you know knock on the door and
[45:52] and and already filled my application
[45:54] out
[45:59] a willing person willing to get up and
[46:02] go out and get a job God will bless you
[46:05] if you'll do it
[46:07] right all right so he says de to declare
[46:10] whom the God has set a perpetuation
[46:12] through faith in his blood to declare
[46:14] his righteousness for the remission of
[46:16] sins that are passed that's
[46:19] justification everybody with me all
[46:21] right let's don't get lost through here
[46:23] therefore we conclude now Paul concludes
[46:25] us brings this whole matter up that a
[46:27] man is justified by faith without the
[46:29] Deeds of the law there is no law going
[46:33] to save you right but remember you are
[46:37] under the law until you're born again
[46:39] yes you are a do and don't person until
[46:42] you're born
[46:43] again cuz remember if you go to the
[46:46] white Throne judgment and you're not
[46:47] born again you going to be judged by
[46:50] what you do amen the Bible says your
[46:53] works I don't want to go anywhere
[46:55] Brother Gary by my works
[46:58] I want if I stand in his righteousness
[47:00] no though he's already been to the
[47:02] Judgment seat praise the Lord he's
[47:05] already been to that judgment seat and
[47:07] I've got to realize I was in him when he
[47:09] went there when he resurrected I
[47:13] resurrected when he said captivity
[47:15] captive that was
[47:17] me he did it for me you got to say he
[47:20] did it for you but he did it for me I
[47:23] needed it I needed that Advocate I
[47:25] needed a perpetuation yes
[47:28] listen I didn't
[47:31] need let me put it this
[47:34] right I didn't need somebody just to
[47:36] cover what I
[47:40] did I needed somebody that could
[47:42] eradicate and like I said before even
[47:44] forget what I did that's who I need cuz
[47:49] if your one sin is remembered you're in
[47:52] trouble oh yes that's why brother Bram
[47:55] comes to the end of his Road he says I'm
[47:58] looking at the what sinless come on
[48:02] sinless bride of Jesus Christ
[48:06] sinless the Bible says without spot or
[48:10] wrinkle that's
[48:14] here do we believe that though do we
[48:17] believe that do we believe that we are
[48:20] in the right
[48:22] Camp you got to believe you're in the
[48:24] right Camp even though people fall away
[48:27] you got a couple of friends that passed
[48:28] away brother Dale and different ones
[48:30] brother edin different ones are falling
[48:32] you know going to the other side but
[48:34] like I said before that they had lived
[48:36] their whole Natural Life to get to that
[48:37] point that's what you and I need to
[48:39] remember that we think too much of life
[48:43] sometimes well I'll say Amen too you
[48:45] said it brother brother D said come on
[48:47] it is we're stuck to this world too much
[48:50] we got too and me included we got too
[48:52] much of I need to and and if I don't and
[48:55] and world
[48:57] yeah
[48:59] world I thought Jesus
[49:01] said if you love the world and the
[49:04] things of the world the love of the
[49:06] father is not even in
[49:08] you I don't love this
[49:10] world but you know what God did he did
[49:13] like what brother Bob said he's put us
[49:15] in a place to where we got to suffer a
[49:16] little bit to hate this
[49:20] place what if right now we were all
[49:23] changed back to 20 years old in this
[49:25] cursed world that we live in
[49:28] that ain't even right you know what
[49:30] ain't right I think I was talking to the
[49:32] lady at at the we were talking about old
[49:34] age and I thought you know what
[49:38] Methuselah was right about the middle
[49:41] Church age he was
[49:43] born and he's 900 years old
[49:48] now see that how see see how that'll
[49:50] make your
[49:52] brain work can you imagine that I mean
[49:56] we even In Our Lifetime dad's lifetime
[49:58] he went from a horse in a buggy to to
[50:00] flying in an airplane and Astronaut much
[50:03] less you take 900 years back there
[50:05] wasn't even United States back
[50:07] then the 1400s all the I mean you're
[50:11] going back and you're going man thank
[50:13] God we don't live long is what I'm
[50:15] trying to say thank God we don't have
[50:17] 400 years to live but praise God we're
[50:20] going to have an eternity to live and we
[50:22] got to get through this one first why
[50:24] did he put us down here to prove he's
[50:26] God AB that's the whole thing to prove
[50:29] he's God he put us right here and he
[50:31] said Satan watch
[50:33] him watch
[50:34] him have you considered my servant job
[50:37] Satan wasn't even looking at
[50:39] him but brother brandham I believe when
[50:42] he come I believe God said hey have you
[50:45] considered my servant William
[50:48] brandham oh you got a hedge built around
[50:50] him he said okay I'll take it off okay
[50:54] I'll take his wife I'll take his baby
[50:56] I'll make him commit suicide if I can
[50:58] and he would have if he could have
[51:01] that's right but God didn't allow
[51:05] it I want to say today have you
[51:08] considered my
[51:10] bride right yes sir why would he say
[51:13] anything else he's proud of us he's

[52:10] anyway you love your wife anyway you
[52:13] make up all it's all good you make you
[52:15] make back up I
[52:18] hope but remember God don't
[52:20] change he loved you to begin with and he
[52:24] can't unlo you that's I can't un love my
[52:27] wife I just can't when she's gone a
[52:29] couple of days I cry in the corner with
[52:31] my thumb stuck in my
[52:38] mouth my deepest darkest Secrets have
[52:40] just been let
[52:43] go I tell them people at work I said my
[52:45] wife has left me for an older man again
[52:48] I said I want to be just I won't be able
[52:50] to eat nothing and they're all just
[52:51] rolling their eyes they're going yeah
[52:53] she went and visit your Dad she'll be
[52:54] back in a little while go to McDonald's
[52:57] so you can't get no can't get no
[52:59] sympathy from
[53:00] nobody but God does love us he can't UNL
[53:04] us absolutely we have our bad days we
[53:07] have our horrible
[53:08] days
[53:10] right but God never leaves you or
[53:13] forsakes you never by no means does he
[53:16] now listen he will withdraw himself from
[53:18] you so that you can pout a little bit he
[53:20] did with the even did with the prophet
[53:22] remember brother R said you owe me an
[53:23] answer God he said God let me stew for
[53:25] three months
[53:27] three months before he gave me an answer
[53:29] listen God will answer you when he wants
[53:32] to we don't he doesn't owe us an answer
[53:37] we owe him one ourself but you think
[53:39] what God did he loved us so much he sent
[53:42] us a prophet in the end time he gave us
[53:44] a message that nobody else has he gave
[53:47] us a message that's got all the power
[53:49] that God ever put into a group of people
[53:51] he's put it into his bride in the end
[53:53] time and I believe I'm looking at her
[53:56] amen amen the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[53:58] best of the best hallu battle hardened
[54:01] veterans somebody's been through
[54:06] something the angel of the church in Lea
[54:08] these things sayth he that is Holy he
[54:10] that's true he that ha the key of David
[54:13] he that openeth and no man shutteth and
[54:15] shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy
[54:17] Works be I have set before thee what an
[54:19] open door and no man can shut it for
[54:22] thou Hast a little strength and Hast
[54:24] kept my word and not denied my name we
[54:27] know it started in 1750 now remember
[54:29] Martin Luther was I mean John Wesley was
[54:31] born in the early 1700s and died 80
[54:34] years later so he wasn't in the last
[54:37] half of the church age but the people
[54:38] carried it on but I'm going to read you
[54:40] something in just a minute what he said
[54:42] or maybe I took it out but he said I the
[54:44] only the the scared Martin Luther he
[54:48] knew what he knew just shall live by
[54:50] faith so you come over here to John
[54:52] Wesley his his his senses of the of the
[54:55] scriptures and and the spirit was
[54:57] broadened but what he feared he didn't
[55:00] fear death he feared that after he died
[55:02] that they would set up a denomination
[55:05] around his teachings and that's exactly
[55:07] what they
[55:08] did
[55:11] right I'm going skip some of this stuff
[55:13] and get down to
[55:16] here you remember what John Wesley I was
[55:19] talking about the other day when he went
[55:21] to Georgia to Savannah with James oakle
[55:25] Thorp to convert to Indians
[55:27] he was goinging over here to show him
[55:28] Jesus Christ and he absolutely got
[55:31] ripped apart Charles got in trouble in
[55:34] in Florida and he got in trouble he got
[55:38] in trouble with the Indians and he says
[55:40] right he returned to England crying I
[55:42] went to America to convert the Indians
[55:44] but oh who shall convert me he knew he
[55:47] didn't have then what he thought he had
[55:49] I pray to God that we do the same thing
[55:52] that we get to a place that we realize
[55:55] that either we do or we don't have what
[55:57] we need to have amen if we don't we can
[56:01] do something about it if we don't and we
[56:03] don't do anything about it then God
[56:05] forbid we're in horrible shape but if
[56:07] you realize like look at this
[56:11] man he's lived his whole life in the
[56:15] ministry he's heading on a mission trip
[56:19] to convert someone to
[56:21] Christianity thinks he's got
[56:24] it sees a group called The moravians who
[56:27] were living a cleaner life than he
[56:30] was they were having problems on the
[56:32] ship the moravians Just prayed and thank
[56:35] the
[56:36] Lord he saw something that he didn't
[56:38] have and you know who orchestrated that
[56:40] don't you God himself orchestrated that
[56:43] but remember what happened to John
[56:45] Wesley is he realized it in his walk in
[56:49] life he realized he didn't have what he
[56:52] thought he had and remember when he came
[56:55] over and said that remember John his
[56:57] brother Charles said he he berated him
[56:59] said John you've got the Holy Ghost how
[57:02] many of you heard that before oh you've
[57:04] got the Holy Ghost you you you do
[57:06] missionary work you sit in a message
[57:08] Church you listen to tapes you read
[57:12] books come
[57:14] on Charles was mad at
[57:17] him but after a while Charles got
[57:19] converted
[57:21] too so this is what he said right here
[57:23] he once remarked that he did not fear
[57:25] that the name of Methodist would leave
[57:27] the Earth but that the spirit might take
[57:30] its flight and boy we know it has man
[57:34] they were all over the YouTube pride
[57:36] week was all in the Methodist churches
[57:37] they had their gay flags all over in the
[57:39] Methodist churches that were United now
[57:42] the ones that are around here are not in
[57:44] it all right but they still part of a
[57:48] system John Wesley would absolutely roll
[57:51] over in his grave if he saw what what he
[57:55] started and what it produced I want to
[57:58] ask you a question if brother Brandon
[58:00] would have come back and do the same
[58:01] would he do the same
[58:03] thing would he do the same thing yes he
[58:06] would yes he would all these people
[58:08] sitting at home listening to tapes all
[58:10] these people doing this that brother R
[58:11] taught
[58:14] against I'm going to preach
[58:16] anyway brother Brown never told us we
[58:18] need to sit home and listen to tapes
[58:22] never he said and listen like I said
[58:24] before his word does not supersede the
[58:27] Bible the Bible tells us that it takes a
[58:29] fivefold Ministry to perfect us he
[58:32] didn't say it took William brandom to do
[58:36] it it said it took a five-fold Ministry
[58:40] that caught the message as John Heard a
[58:42] Voice and turned what did he see he
[58:45] couldn't interpret it but praise God me
[58:47] and you can interpret that when we hear
[58:49] that voice we can turn and we can see
[58:51] the son of man in a group of people yes
[58:54] in the end time amen today yes sir
[58:57] that's right we don't have to guess we
[59:00] know where God is we know what he's
[59:02] doing yes sir I hope you open your eyes
[59:05] and realize that you're a part of
[59:09] it and did the angel of the church and
[59:11] lay out to see he that is true has the
[59:13] Key of David openeth and no man shutteth
[59:15] and shutteth and no man openest now
[59:17] watch what brother Ram says it does not
[59:19] mean true in just a sense that it's
[59:21] opposite to false it expresses the
[59:23] perfect realization of an IDE idea has
[59:26] contrasted with its partial realization
[59:29] as I pronounced this morning you got
[59:31] shadows and you got the real listen this
[59:33] is not a
[59:34] shadow this is
[59:36] real this is not a shadow of the son of
[59:40] man this is the son of man walking on
[59:44] back back on Earth again in two feet I
[59:46] believe that just with all my heart I
[59:48] believe that if I don't make it I hope
[59:49] y'all do but I believe it with all my
[59:52] heart that God is walking on two feet
[59:53] somewhere on this Earth in a group of
[59:55] people
[59:56] and he will manifest what he said he
[59:58] will
[1:00:01] manifest we can sit today and we can
[1:00:03] pray until 6 o' in the morning that the
[1:00:05] sun's not going to come
[1:00:07] up Sun's going to come right up why
[1:00:10] because brother Louise said God said so
[1:00:14] but God but God said the sun's going to
[1:00:20] shine then we we know what the talk
[1:00:24] about the Mana
[1:00:26] what is
[1:00:27] true versus
[1:00:30] false Jesus said I'm the True Vine so
[1:00:33] there must be a false Vine but the True
[1:00:36] Vine is the one that brings forth what
[1:00:38] true or good fruit or as I said before
[1:00:41] the tuning fork is the is the what would
[1:00:45] you call it sister Astra it would be the
[1:00:46] it'd be the the dividing it would be
[1:00:48] whatever it is if it's going to be a c
[1:00:50] you got to go to that tuning Fort and
[1:00:52] hit it and that's C that's whatever your
[1:00:55] sounds are
[1:00:56] that's your um a
[1:00:59] constant everything has to come to a
[1:01:01] constant so what the word of God is a
[1:01:03] constant right this is what we have to
[1:01:05] come back to like I said before it
[1:01:08] doesn't matter what you bring if it
[1:01:10] doesn't match this it's not right that's
[1:01:14] right if you hit that symbol and it's
[1:01:16] supposed to be C and it comes up D
[1:01:19] there's something
[1:01:20] wrong so we have to have a standard
[1:01:22] that's what I'm trying to say we have to
[1:01:24] have a standard we have to have have a
[1:01:26] Mark that we go back to and have a
[1:01:29] standard I got some um I weigh my arrows
[1:01:32] that I shoot with and I've got this
[1:01:34] little bitty um scale that that is in
[1:01:38] grains cuz you you you weigh Arrows by
[1:01:41] grains and I've got this thing that says
[1:01:44] 15 Point whatever grains and that's my
[1:01:48] standard that's what I
[1:01:51] calibrate my scale with because I mean
[1:01:53] I'm talking about micr grains like 001
[1:01:57] is what I'm trying to get it to so I put
[1:01:59] that thing on there and I hit the button
[1:02:01] and if it goes to zero that's exactly or
[1:02:04] 15.2 something grain that's what it is
[1:02:06] that's my standard same way with the
[1:02:09] word of God the that word of God is a
[1:02:11] standard that's why we need to read our
[1:02:13] Bible as much or more than we read
[1:02:15] message
[1:02:23] books I'm gonna tell you something if
[1:02:26] you can't prove these major doctrines by
[1:02:28] the Bible yourself and not say brother
[1:02:31] brandham said I heard a message preacher
[1:02:34] not too long well it's been about 10 or
[1:02:35] 15 years ago he said I'm nothing but a
[1:02:37] message
[1:02:38] parakeet I thought you're
[1:02:41] lost cuz a parakeet only says what the
[1:02:44] next person
[1:02:45] says and you know what if you walk in
[1:02:47] and teach that parakeet something else
[1:02:49] it's going to say that too I am not a
[1:02:51] message
[1:02:52] parakeet you're not either amen
[1:02:56] we get the essence of the message and we
[1:02:58] preach it to you the way God provided I
[1:02:59] believe through a prophet messenger
[1:03:01] along with the Bible but this is our
[1:03:04] standard this is our set weight that's
[1:03:07] what it we put it on that scale this is
[1:03:09] what it is right here all right
[1:03:11] everything else is false but this and we
[1:03:13] know the message is not false so if you
[1:03:16] think something contrary is contrary to
[1:03:19] the to the Bible then whose problem is
[1:03:21] it yours it's yours and mine that we
[1:03:23] don't have a teacher
[1:03:26] that can teach us how to get back to
[1:03:27] this right here I'm not you know what
[1:03:30] I'm not throwing away I read mess well
[1:03:32] read messages all the time I don't
[1:03:33] listen tape cuz I fall asleep but I can
[1:03:35] read I can
[1:03:37] read but what about reading this get
[1:03:39] back to the good old
[1:03:41] Bible and then you can see one God out
[1:03:43] of the Bible yes well explain one God
[1:03:46] there brother Donnie when now brother
[1:03:48] brandham said now how you going to get
[1:03:51] somebody to even talk to you when you
[1:03:53] say that name but you'll say let's go
[1:03:56] into the
[1:03:57] Bible and let's look in the first let's
[1:04:00] look at the first here in in Exodus 20
[1:04:03] let's see it says oh behold oh Israel
[1:04:06] the Lord thy God is one God abely that's
[1:04:09] right uh I and my father are
[1:04:12] one uh the Lord God is our healer
[1:04:17] Redeemer savior he's not seven different
[1:04:20] things he's seven different names for
[1:04:22] one person or seven different compound
[1:04:24] names of Jehovah
[1:04:26] can you do that without saying brother
[1:04:28] random said then you've got the true
[1:04:31] essence of the message cuz you know
[1:04:32] what's ringing in the back of your head
[1:04:34] what brother randam
[1:04:36] said that's where we got it we heard the
[1:04:40] voice of that angel as John heard that
[1:04:42] voice we heard the voice and then the
[1:04:44] voice turned us to the Bible and then
[1:04:46] the Bible says this this this and this
[1:04:49] and we say that ain't nothing but the
[1:04:50] truth but be able to explain it to your
[1:04:52] neighbor number one live in front of
[1:04:54] your neighbor first H then be able to
[1:04:57] explain to him right I don't know where
[1:05:00] that came from but let's go he had the
[1:05:02] Key of David now it says in Isaiah 22:22
[1:05:05] and the key of the House of David will I
[1:05:07] lay upon his shoulder now brother R is
[1:05:09] explaining that we if we talk about a
[1:05:11] key we think we got it in our hand
[1:05:13] brother John and we go over here and we
[1:05:14] open the door right but now the Bible
[1:05:17] tells us a little bit something
[1:05:18] different to that it means in the Old
[1:05:22] Testament thank God for a prophet that
[1:05:24] could take us back to the old Testament
[1:05:27] what the Key of David signified at that
[1:05:29] time is a mere shadow that time his time
[1:05:33] which is now fulfilled in Jesus standing
[1:05:35] in the midst of the lampstands it has to
[1:05:37] do with our Lord after his
[1:05:41] resurrection and not his Earthly
[1:05:44] pilgrimage all right is everybody with
[1:05:46] me but what does this key
[1:05:49] signify the answer lies in the position
[1:05:53] of the
[1:05:54] key it's not when it goes in the
[1:05:57] door it's not worn around his
[1:05:59] neck it's not in his hand it is not
[1:06:03] placed in the hands of other men or the
[1:06:06] verse could not be saying that he alone
[1:06:08] has the use of that key for he alone
[1:06:10] opens and shuts and no man has that
[1:06:12] right but Jesus himself isn't that right
[1:06:14] but where is that key it's on his
[1:06:18] shoulder but what the shoulder have to
[1:06:20] do with that read Isaiah 9:6 and the
[1:06:23] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:06:25] but what does this mean the answer is
[1:06:27] this the phrase government upon his
[1:06:29] shoulder comes from the wedding
[1:06:32] ceremony oh it's bringing more light now
[1:06:35] it's coming from the wedding ceremony of
[1:06:37] the East when the bride has been
[1:06:38] committed to the groom she takes off her
[1:06:40] veil and places it over the groom's
[1:06:44] shoulder signifying that not only is she
[1:06:47] under his Dominion that's what we were
[1:06:49] talking about dominating female that she
[1:06:51] has transferred her rights to him do we
[1:06:55] have any rights nope we get them all up
[1:06:58] we have no rights at all the only thing
[1:07:00] we have the rights is in here oh we got
[1:07:02] a Bill of Rights we got all these rights
[1:07:04] and we got these things that we can do
[1:07:05] and can't do but what about this right
[1:07:07] here back to our standard now watch that
[1:07:10] she has transferred her rights to him in
[1:07:12] other words that's why sisters you lose
[1:07:14] your name you lose your maiden name
[1:07:17] because you're not a Thomas anymore you
[1:07:20] have give that right up to someone
[1:07:22] else which is her husband
[1:07:26] but now remember though once she
[1:07:27] transfers that responsibility to him
[1:07:30] it's your responsibility to take care of
[1:07:32] her
[1:07:33] amen all you Brothers it's your
[1:07:35] responsibility to take care of your
[1:07:37] wife remember brother Brian said she
[1:07:39] won't have to give an account for you
[1:07:41] but you'll have to give an account for
[1:07:42] her
[1:07:44] wow you know why because of that because
[1:07:47] of what I just said a dominating female
[1:07:50] is over or strips herself above the
[1:07:52] headship of the man and he'll have to
[1:07:54] give an account for that that she has
[1:07:57] transferred a right to him that he is
[1:07:58] the head but also look that he Bears the
[1:08:01] responsibility and the care that he and
[1:08:03] he alone no one else no other man no
[1:08:06] other power has any right and
[1:08:09] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:08:12] Key of David God being Sovereign he
[1:08:14] formed You by Divine decree exactly who
[1:08:17] would be his bride amen now that I agree
[1:08:20] with I agree 100% he knew who she was he
[1:08:24] took care of her made sure you got
[1:08:29] here CU he had a piece of him waiting on
[1:08:32] you he decreed Genesis 1: 126 I'm going
[1:08:35] to have a bride and she's going to have
[1:08:38] dominion she's going to have power she's
[1:08:40] going to be she is him
[1:08:42] yes she did not choose
[1:08:45] him I'm sorry he forew by Divine decree
[1:08:47] exactly who would be in his bride he
[1:08:49] chose her she did not choose him he
[1:08:52] called her she did not come on her own
[1:08:55] he died for her he washed her in his own
[1:08:58] blood he paid the price for her she
[1:09:00] belongs to him and him alone she is
[1:09:03] wholly committed to him and he accepts
[1:09:06] the
[1:09:08] obligation do we really do that or do we
[1:09:11] really try to figure things out
[1:09:14] oursel hello somebody she's wholly
[1:09:17] committed to him and he accepts the
[1:09:20] obligation didn't Jesus say in the
[1:09:22] scripture cast your burdens on somebody
[1:09:26] else cast your burdens on yourself I
[1:09:28] ain't helping you no he said cast your
[1:09:31] burdens on me why cuz you're my wife
[1:09:34] cast your burdens on me he is her head
[1:09:37] for Christ is the head of his church as
[1:09:38] Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the
[1:09:41] bride is happy that he is her Lord he
[1:09:44] speaks and she obeys for that is her
[1:09:48] Delight do you really Delight in being
[1:09:50] bride or do you really just fall asleep
[1:09:53] in the church service
[1:09:55] but have men heeded this truth now watch
[1:09:58] have they esteemed his person who alone
[1:10:00] has full sovereignty and authority over
[1:10:02] his church I say
[1:10:04] no because of the dominating female
[1:10:07] thing for in every age the church has
[1:10:10] been governed by hierarchy a priesthood
[1:10:13] an Apostolic succession closing the door
[1:10:16] of mercy and Grace To whom it will and
[1:10:18] instead of assuming the love and
[1:10:20] responsibility of the church it has with
[1:10:22] mercenary lust prayed upon her and
[1:10:25] destroyed
[1:10:26] her the clergy lived the luxury while
[1:10:29] the poor Church fed on the husk of abuse
[1:10:32] and not one age did any different each
[1:10:35] bound itself to organization and put the
[1:10:37] government upon men and committed the
[1:10:40] church to that government
[1:10:44] wow the the next scripture says he that
[1:10:46] openeth and no man shth and shutteth and
[1:10:48] no man
[1:10:49] openeth now the great missionary age
[1:10:52] Brotherly Love was the age of missions
[1:10:54] and what I telling you sanctification
[1:10:56] what's God doing he's sending he's
[1:10:59] sending the message today and all during
[1:11:01] the world in out into the world to do
[1:11:03] what to sanctify a
[1:11:05] church sanctify by the washing of the
[1:11:07] water of the word what are we preaching
[1:11:09] the water of the word we're preaching
[1:11:10] the word so that that water can wash you
[1:11:12] it wasn't happening in every nation but
[1:11:15] God opened a door to the greatest
[1:11:17] missionary age you had all brother R
[1:11:19] tries to name a few he doesn't even get
[1:11:21] close to naming all of them all the
[1:11:23] great people that's went out uh the
[1:11:25] Livingston and different people like
[1:11:26] that that went all over the world and
[1:11:28] preached the gospel why to get a people
[1:11:31] ready so that God can speak to them in
[1:11:34] the next step and what happened they
[1:11:36] denied
[1:11:37] it some took it some denied it now the
[1:11:41] great missionary age brotherly love the
[1:11:43] age of missions let me just name to you
[1:11:45] some of the Great Men he just wrote some
[1:11:47] of the names down John Wesley George
[1:11:49] Whitfield Charles fny Dwight Moody
[1:11:52] William KY the great missionary that
[1:11:53] went to India in 177 3 David Livingston
[1:11:56] to South Africa see all these some of
[1:11:59] those great men I got names of plenty of
[1:12:01] them here great men that lived in that
[1:12:02] brotherly love the black man the white
[1:12:04] man the brown man the yellow man all
[1:12:06] walls were broken down and these men
[1:12:09] went out into the mission Fields
[1:12:10] Brotherly Love stretching out a hand to
[1:12:13] All Nations everywhere and it was opened
[1:12:15] up to them that they could go another
[1:12:17] Open Door age because they couldn't
[1:12:19] before that they couldn't have done it
[1:12:22] the papacy of Rome in other words what
[1:12:24] had it so crushed wouldn't let them
[1:12:26] travel wouldn't let them do these or
[1:12:27] they either got there first and injected
[1:12:30] their Doctrine in but God was going to
[1:12:32] make sure that his gospel got out he's
[1:12:35] going to send them the papacy of Rome
[1:12:37] and so forth had it also closed up till
[1:12:39] they couldn't go but in that age the
[1:12:41] door was open cuz he said it was an Open
[1:12:45] Door age they opened up many doors
[1:12:47] during that age the doors to the gospel
[1:12:50] the doors to the mission field the door
[1:12:53] back to Christ and everything was opened
[1:12:55] up during that age and you can see what
[1:12:57] they did the Brethren done a great job
[1:13:00] out of
[1:13:03] it see we give all those names out like
[1:13:05] that and we say well they wouldn't like
[1:13:07] brother Bram no but you know what
[1:13:08] they'll have converts in glory that will
[1:13:10] be bride because they had a message for
[1:13:13] their hour now they weren't prophets
[1:13:15] remember they could be reformers still
[1:13:17] they reformed the people back but they
[1:13:19] didn't it wasn't a prophet to restore
[1:13:20] everything back there had to be just one
[1:13:22] of them right right one for for every
[1:13:26] age everybody all right with
[1:13:30] that so I said the corn grew and after a
[1:13:32] while it got a tassel on it and that
[1:13:34] tassel looked B down to the leaf and
[1:13:36] said ha you ain't got nothing you old
[1:13:38] former lutherans see I I'm the breed of
[1:13:41] the great missionary time the wind
[1:13:42] blowed and the little tassels fell off
[1:13:45] like that and dropped down that's Wesley
[1:13:47] sanctification that was the greatest
[1:13:49] missionary age we've ever had has been
[1:13:51] the wesleyian church and during the time
[1:13:53] of Wesley even exceeds this
[1:13:58] age the westle and church age it was a
[1:14:00] missionary age and it scattered what did
[1:14:02] it do it scattered it brother rown said
[1:14:05] the seed is not air with the Shu I want
[1:14:06] you to watch this we'll close right here
[1:14:08] cuz we got to cover this notice see how
[1:14:11] close it looks Matthew said 24:24 the
[1:14:13] two spirits in the last days the church
[1:14:16] Spirit of the church people see how he
[1:14:19] rewarded that the church Spirit not God
[1:14:22] Spirit the church Spirit of the church
[1:14:25] people and the bride Spirit of the Bride
[1:14:29] people makes some
[1:14:30] different would be so close together
[1:14:33] till it would deceive the very elect if
[1:14:35] it was possible that's how close look
[1:14:37] how it's come through the stalk now
[1:14:38] notice we're going to type something
[1:14:40] here Luther in the church age of
[1:14:42] bringing forth the bride seed was the
[1:14:45] same in
[1:14:47] spirit just one little grain of seed
[1:14:51] Luther stood out on it in other words
[1:14:52] the two shoots that was justification by
[1:14:55] faith he was the very type of Hagar the
[1:14:57] stalk now remember what was
[1:15:00] Hagar she's a Bond woman she was not the
[1:15:04] one the promised son was to come through
[1:15:05] but God allowed her to bring forth ishma
[1:15:10] and ishma was a wild child we know that
[1:15:13] but God blessed
[1:15:15] him and some of them will be there but
[1:15:18] some of the radicals will not but some
[1:15:20] of them will be there but that was Hagar
[1:15:23] that was what the Wild Child the that
[1:15:25] was the that was the uh remember the
[1:15:28] seed is what God's looking for right but
[1:15:31] the plants got to be there before the
[1:15:33] seed can come so he's not going to do
[1:15:35] away with the plant but the plant the
[1:15:38] stock is not the promised son Hagar did
[1:15:42] not produce the promised Sun she was
[1:15:44] part of the economy but she didn't
[1:15:46] produce the promised Sun notice Westley
[1:15:49] was a type of Sarah the Philadelphia and
[1:15:52] the age of love that brought forth the
[1:15:53] tassel
[1:15:56] that in Wesley's age there was more
[1:15:57] missionaries than any other age we've
[1:15:59] seen the great missionary age of John
[1:16:01] Wesley's time so now it's coming better
[1:16:04] because Sarah was the true one but it's
[1:16:07] heading toward more the tle excuse me
[1:16:10] it's heading toward more the seed
[1:16:12] now through Sarah shall thy seed be
[1:16:16] Sarah wasn't a
[1:16:19] seed she received seed and brought forth
[1:16:21] a child all right but Pentecost
[1:16:25] represented
[1:16:26] Mary all right why the shouting good
[1:16:29] time watch the last stage of it now she
[1:16:32] has not the
[1:16:37] seed it looked like it but it wasn't it
[1:16:42] it was a carrier or something that what
[1:16:43] something that protected the seed listen
[1:16:46] between Martin Luther John Wesley
[1:16:47] between John Wesley and brother R's
[1:16:50] message lay out of CN age there had to
[1:16:51] be a Pentecostal age to bring those
[1:16:54] gifts back
[1:16:55] to show that something was coming that
[1:16:57] was the grain it looked like the grain
[1:17:00] but it wasn't the grain you and I are
[1:17:02] the grain cuz what was the grain the
[1:17:05] grain was the son of man the stock
[1:17:07] wasn't the son of man had the life of
[1:17:08] the son of man in it but it was not the
[1:17:10] son of man the son of man is the wheat
[1:17:13] the plant The Germ but Pentecost
[1:17:15] represented Mary Mary the last age of it
[1:17:18] now she was not the seed yet the life of
[1:17:20] the seed was in her all right but it
[1:17:23] didn't mature hadn't m matured yet right
[1:17:26] I feel very religious it hadn't matured
[1:17:29] yet it was there but it wasn't
[1:17:32] matured in other words the life was
[1:17:35] going through it but brother John he
[1:17:37] called for seed he didn't call for stalk
[1:17:40] he didn't call for tassel he didn't call
[1:17:42] for green leaves he didn't call for a
[1:17:45] covering he called for that grain to be
[1:17:47] just exactly you can't plant the husk
[1:17:50] and it come up you can't take the stalk
[1:17:52] and stick it in the ground it'll die
[1:17:54] it's not going to come to seed but you
[1:17:56] let it come to seed take it out dry it
[1:17:59] out get the husk off of it take it back
[1:18:02] plant it in the ground it'll bring you
[1:18:04] the same thing again and that's what you
[1:18:06] and I we have come to seed
[1:18:09] time so it is with our Pentecostal age
[1:18:13] that we're living in there has to got to
[1:18:14] come forth a word of God that's inner or
[1:18:17] undenominational outside of the Realms
[1:18:20] of that
[1:18:22] denomination real quick let's look at
[1:18:24] sanctification just for a minute because
[1:18:25] this is what this is what this age
[1:18:28] represented it was cleaned up what
[1:18:32] Luther was not dirty but Luther was not
[1:18:34] totally clean he still had
[1:18:37] denominational doctrines and all the
[1:18:39] other things right he was pretty much a
[1:18:41] rascal CU he he caused a war and he
[1:18:42] caused several hundred people to die and
[1:18:45] all that stuff God just God
[1:18:48] listen you say well that was bad we were
[1:18:52] worse
[1:18:55] we weren't living under the word of God
[1:18:57] we were living out from under the word
[1:18:58] of God we were doing what we wanted to
[1:19:00] do but he cleaned us up and set us aside
[1:19:03] for use our purpose and then I told you
[1:19:07] the glass about representing the glass
[1:19:09] now watch this is what sanctification is
[1:19:11] look as a process now remember what I
[1:19:13] said this morning justification is not a
[1:19:17] process everybody with me on that
[1:19:20] justification is not a
[1:19:22] process it's a it's an event that
[1:19:25] happens that God takes your sins away
[1:19:28] Cuts them off that's what brother B said
[1:19:31] chops off now when you chop something
[1:19:35] off it's separated from what it was
[1:19:37] attached
[1:19:38] to so your sins were separated done away
[1:19:42] with an act of justification but an act
[1:19:45] of sanctification means becoming more
[1:19:47] holy through time and it just makes
[1:19:50] sense we're not all clean at the same
[1:19:52] time we all got our demons that we fight
[1:19:54] for years or months or even days and
[1:19:57] then sometimes God will take them away
[1:19:59] right then but remember don't question
[1:20:04] God he may leave something on
[1:20:07] you like Bob was talking about he may
[1:20:10] leave something on you to try you to see
[1:20:12] what you'll do about it he knows what
[1:20:14] you'll do about it but you
[1:20:16] don't like a child growing up into
[1:20:18] adulthood Christians become more
[1:20:20] Sanctified over time 1 Peter 2:2 this
[1:20:24] means that Christians should expect to
[1:20:26] make progress to grow and
[1:20:30] become we ought to try this become more
[1:20:33] loving kind and humble and
[1:20:36] self-controlled over their
[1:20:40] life John 17:17 sanctify them through
[1:20:44] thy truth Thy word is the truth
[1:20:49] questions and answers
[1:20:51] 1959 the Holy Spirit what you're
[1:20:53] believing unto eternal life now watch
[1:20:56] this watch this right
[1:20:58] here the holy spirit's what you are
[1:21:00] believing unto eternal life but when the
[1:21:05] Holy Spirit comes it is eternal life
[1:21:09] Shake Yourself just a minute we'll be
[1:21:10] done five minutes it is eternal life are
[1:21:15] you believing too or you got it you got
[1:21:17] to realize that you're believing unto
[1:21:21] you're begotten of the spirit at
[1:21:25] sanctification cuz remember God won't
[1:21:27] dwell in an unclean vessel so he's got
[1:21:29] to clean you up so that he can deal with
[1:21:32] you
[1:21:34] amen you're begotten of the spirit at
[1:21:37] sanctification but never born of the
[1:21:39] spirit until the Holy Ghost comes
[1:21:44] in that's correct a baby's got life in
[1:21:47] the womb of a mother little muscles are
[1:21:50] quivering now remember that's not human
[1:21:52] life hello
[1:21:55] that's not human life that's like he
[1:21:58] said nature life that the muscles are
[1:22:00] twitching but it's not a person yet
[1:22:03] that's right a baby's got life in the
[1:22:05] womb of the mother little muscles are
[1:22:07] quivering it's a life but it's a
[1:22:10] different life when it breathes the
[1:22:12] breath of life into its nostrils it's
[1:22:15] different amen my dear methis Brethren
[1:22:18] Pilgrim Holiness nazarine the baptism of
[1:22:21] the Holy Ghost is different from
[1:22:23] sanctification that's right
[1:22:24] sanctification is the cleansing which is
[1:22:27] preparation of life but when the Holy
[1:22:31] Ghost comes in it is life preparation is
[1:22:35] cleaning the vessel that's what John
[1:22:38] Wesley's message did it clean the
[1:22:40] vessels up so God can use them more so
[1:22:43] that God can pour out his holy spirit on
[1:22:46] a group of people that could speak in
[1:22:47] tongues that could heal the sick raise
[1:22:50] the dead have all the signs and wonders
[1:22:52] he had to clean the church up listen he
[1:22:53] had to clean you up too
[1:22:55] amen huj preparation is cleaning the
[1:22:58] vessel I'm looking at vessels today
[1:23:00] that's the vessel God's looking at the
[1:23:03] Holy Ghost is filling of the vessel all
[1:23:06] right sanctification is cleaning the
[1:23:08] vessel the Holy Ghost is filling the
[1:23:10] vessel sanctification means cleans and
[1:23:12] set aside for service the holy spirit is
[1:23:15] put is put it in service you are the
[1:23:19] vessel that God cleaned up how can I
[1:23:23] overcome
[1:23:24] last quote First under justification
[1:23:27] water baptism second under the new birth
[1:23:29] look look how look how he words that
[1:23:32] second under the new birth of Wesley now
[1:23:36] it ain't the new birth of you
[1:23:38] sanctification is not the new birth in
[1:23:39] this time God's moved up everybody with
[1:23:43] me second under the new birth of Wesley
[1:23:46] sanctification which cleanses and
[1:23:49] thirdly under the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:50] Spirit putting that Sanctified vessel
[1:23:53] into service the word sanctify means a
[1:23:55] compound Greek word which means clean
[1:23:57] and set aside for service set aside for
[1:23:59] service now the Holy Spirit puts it in
[1:24:02] service and we'll notice when the
[1:24:04] unclean Spirit has gone out from a man
[1:24:05] he walks in dry places that's exactly
[1:24:08] what the church has done watch what he
[1:24:09] says Baptist methodists those who
[1:24:12] believed in sanctification then Jesus
[1:24:15] said the unclean spirit that went out
[1:24:17] returns back to this church body okay
[1:24:21] words this this is God wording this for
[1:24:23] us you know that don't you it's not
[1:24:24] brother bradam this is God wording it
[1:24:26] for us so that we could read it right
[1:24:29] today 2024 God knew we'd read this quote
[1:24:32] and that's how he put it that's how he
[1:24:33] was written that was
[1:24:35] spoke you don't believe that do you you
[1:24:38] don't believe God had that you don't
[1:24:39] believe God had that message so so much
[1:24:42] to where he spoke it to where 50 years
[1:24:43] or 60 years later he knew we'd use it in
[1:24:47] our sermon to bring a
[1:24:51] point the unclean spirit that went out
[1:24:54] returned turns back to this church body
[1:24:56] and finds the house garnished swept
[1:24:58] clean living Pure Clean lives all right
[1:25:01] but then if that house isn't filled
[1:25:03] occupied then he comes in with seven
[1:25:05] other evil demons worse than he was in
[1:25:08] the last stage of this
[1:25:13] place place it's seven times worse than
[1:25:17] it was at the first place they had been
[1:25:19] better to stay
[1:25:22] Lutheran than it would be to receive
[1:25:25] that light and fail to follow
[1:25:29] it so will the Pentecostal see you know
[1:25:33] what I mean the house is garnished what
[1:25:35] happened then when the enemy that went
[1:25:37] out under sanctification now watch was
[1:25:39] that was washed out all right remember
[1:25:43] that in Luke unclean Spirit goes out
[1:25:46] house is swept and garnished I mean
[1:25:48] cleaned up every
[1:25:51] corner returned back and found the house
[1:25:54] not filled with the Holy Spirit now the
[1:25:56] state of the church is joined with the
[1:25:58] league of churches the World Council of
[1:26:00] churches and it's a state now that
[1:26:02] connects it with Roman Catholicism and
[1:26:04] all the rest and now it's seven times
[1:26:06] worse as it was when it come out of
[1:26:08] Lutheranism that's where man takes
[1:26:12] it that's where man takes it not God
[1:26:16] God's got a program sir and that program
[1:26:19] is not going to be altered it's not
[1:26:20] going to be changed but you know what
[1:26:22] that plan is that plan is he saw
[1:26:24] somebody receive that plan and become
[1:26:27] that plan he saw somebody that would say
[1:26:30] hey that ain't nothing but the truth and
[1:26:32] quit looking over here and start looking
[1:26:33] over here quit looking at our own self
[1:26:35] quit looking
[1:26:36] at
[1:26:38] church quit looking at
[1:26:42] church look at self work on
[1:26:47] self that's where man takes it but not
[1:26:51] God cuz God's fixing to take it from the
[1:26:52] Methodist and he's fixing and to give it
[1:26:54] over to the
[1:26:56] Pentecostals then we know what the
[1:26:58] Pentecostal done with it they cabbage
[1:26:59] down on this gift is it and God moved
[1:27:02] right on God moved through every Church
[1:27:04] age he moved on and on and on let's
[1:27:07] stand to our feet you love the
[1:27:10] Lord he's
[1:27:15] good and his Mercy endures
[1:27:19] forever are you a filled vessel
[1:27:21] today have you been filled up I know
[1:27:24] some of you is fed up cuz sometimes I
[1:27:27] get that way but you got to be filled up
[1:27:30] when you get fed
[1:27:32] up get sick and tired of being sick and
[1:27:35] tired get sick and tired of that Samson
[1:27:37] going around and around but you know one
[1:27:39] day Samson realized he was getting
[1:27:41] stronger again because his hair was
[1:27:43] growing he knew he was in a place that
[1:27:46] was the only place that God wanted him
[1:27:48] to get his strength back and I'm like
[1:27:50] what one preacher said one time he said
[1:27:54] you see how deceived they were they were
[1:27:56] standing there watching him and mocking
[1:27:57] him and his hair every day was getting
[1:28:00] longer and they never realized it they
[1:28:04] thought they thought his ability was in
[1:28:05] his no it was in that hair that was
[1:28:08] growing I if I'd have been there I
[1:28:10] barara I'd shave it every
[1:28:12] day but what did God do he hid it in the
[1:28:16] Simplicity of just watching that old man
[1:28:18] with no eyes not old man young man with
[1:28:21] no eyes pushing it well we got him now
[1:28:23] yeah we got him now and you know what
[1:28:26] Samson like brother R said one day
[1:28:28] Samson reached
[1:28:31] back he said
[1:28:33] oh they got it
[1:28:36] coming cuz you're hiding yourself in
[1:28:38] Simplicity God you're going to give me
[1:28:39] my strength back Samson stood that one
[1:28:42] day and he said One More Time Lord just
[1:28:45] one more give me one more chance to
[1:28:48] write my wrongs and I'll take down more
[1:28:50] Philistines than I ever did in my entire
[1:28:52] life and one day they let him number two
[1:28:57] they let him off that
[1:28:59] wheel they should have left him in that
[1:29:01] wheel one day the old got boy that was
[1:29:05] that was there he said lean me up
[1:29:07] against that post he didn't know which
[1:29:09] post it was but I believe by Revelation
[1:29:10] he realized that was the two pillars
[1:29:12] that held the whole place
[1:29:15] up if you're God L he'll take you where
[1:29:18] you need to go whether you're blind or
[1:29:19] not amen he said lean me up against that
[1:29:23] post son
[1:29:24] he leaned up against that post and like
[1:29:26] I said he reached back and he went oh I
[1:29:28] think it's long enough now I feel the
[1:29:30] power of God back
[1:29:32] again he said just lean me up against
[1:29:35] that other one he lean said I'm kind of
[1:29:37] tired he leaned him up against this one
[1:29:40] that little boy is
[1:29:41] like dude you can't
[1:29:44] see you're here they're mocking you they
[1:29:47] hate you you've been in that wheel for I
[1:29:49] don't know how long what are you going
[1:29:51] to
[1:29:52] do he said just hang hang on a minute he
[1:29:56] put his hands
[1:29:57] out now remember he's a little bitty kid
[1:29:59] he wasn't no big
[1:30:01] Hercules he put his hands out and the
[1:30:03] little boy was like man he's kind of
[1:30:06] crazy but something I Believe come in
[1:30:08] that boy's
[1:30:10] mind I
[1:30:13] remember long hair
[1:30:17] strength and I don't believe that boy
[1:30:19] was one of the 3,000 that got killed I
[1:30:20] believe he High tailed it out the door
[1:30:24] but when Samson all he done was is he
[1:30:26] said One More Time Lord just give me one
[1:30:29] more chance I'll make up for those years
[1:30:32] I'll make up for this time that these
[1:30:34] Philistines have mocked you and me cuz
[1:30:37] they were mocking him they were mocking
[1:30:39] God through Samson where's your God
[1:30:41] Samson where's where's where's your
[1:30:43] strength at Samson then didn't he
[1:30:45] realize he had long hair again then all
[1:30:47] of a sudden he just took one big push
[1:30:50] and he pushed both pillars out and I bet
[1:30:52] you them pillars were this big around
[1:30:54] cuz what it was I believe it was an arch
[1:30:55] that was holding everything up and they
[1:30:57] were up in the top floor
[1:31:00] partying where's your God
[1:31:03] Samson and I believe Samson just said
[1:31:06] you're fixing to see
[1:31:08] him your whole world's getting ready to
[1:31:10] Tumble down because I'm back to where
[1:31:13] God wanted me to be are we where God
[1:31:16] wants us to
[1:31:17] be have we grown our locks back sure
[1:31:20] we've had problems we've have had our
[1:31:22] head shaved a couple of times
[1:31:25] amen but God let it all grow back out
[1:31:29] and he hid it from the people and then
[1:31:32] the strength came back to Samson oh he
[1:31:33] died that day physically but he took
[1:31:36] 3,000 Philistines with him that were
[1:31:38] unbelievers I pray that what we do will
[1:31:42] take down that many unbelievers in this
[1:31:44] world and convert
[1:31:47] them but he said One More Time Lord just
[1:31:50] once more visit me one more time let me
[1:31:54] feel your spirit One More Time Lord he
[1:31:56] felt it the whole of his life every time
[1:31:58] he'd get in a situation he'd reach back
[1:32:00] and pull one of them curls and he'd say
[1:32:01] oh you're with me kill a thousand
[1:32:04] Philistines kill a bear and a
[1:32:07] Lon Bear
[1:32:09] Hands kind of a feat but when when deala
[1:32:13] got a hold of
[1:32:15] him he fell let's don't fall let's don't
[1:32:19] fall and if we do fall let your hair go
[1:32:22] back out
[1:32:25] don't care if you got to go through that
[1:32:26] Wheel of Life you know that Wheel of
[1:32:29] Life everybody's on it right well pray
[1:32:31] for me everybody's on it right everybody
[1:32:34] everybody's on that Wheel of Life right
[1:32:36] well finally finally Samson he said okay
[1:32:40] I've had enough when we going to say
[1:32:42] we've had enough and let's take down
[1:32:44] some of these Giants that's so so
[1:32:47] bothers us where God can't speak to us
[1:32:50] and I'm talking about all of us where
[1:32:52] God just can't even speak to us anymore
[1:32:54] I want to be where God can speak to me
[1:32:56] freely speak to you
[1:32:57] freely and not have any
[1:33:00] reservation with speaking to you not not
[1:33:03] well well brother way we want him to
[1:33:04] speak through you well I hope he does
[1:33:06] speak through me but guess what he's
[1:33:07] going to speak through you
[1:33:08] too we're the
[1:33:10] bride I'm not your husband spiritually
[1:33:14] yeah I'm your head here at church but
[1:33:16] he's the head of all we look to him not
[1:33:21] to one person God won't share his glory
[1:33:23] with
[1:33:24] nobody never will he but we give him
[1:33:27] then all the all the glory cuz what did
[1:33:29] Samson do he said
[1:33:33] Lord one more time he was speaking
[1:33:36] directly to God he said Lord just give
[1:33:39] me one more chance cuz he knew his
[1:33:41] strength came from the Lord his strength
[1:33:42] didn't come from down here on the earth
[1:33:44] it came from God with that vow that he
[1:33:46] took he said Lord I'm back in place he
[1:33:49] said just visit me one more time I hope
[1:33:52] he visits us one more time
[1:33:54] let's sing a
[1:33:56] song in me a

[1:36:46] Old Testament but what about a
[1:36:50] Believer what about a Believer that's
[1:36:52] got the Holy Ghost in their
[1:36:54] soul what a power that is we don't have
[1:36:57] to have our hair grow out man told me
[1:37:00] one time he said wouldn't I Jesus had
[1:37:02] long hair I said if you la like him you
[1:37:04] can have it that's
[1:37:06] right of course he didn't say no more
[1:37:09] but he took a Nazarite vow if you'll
[1:37:11] take that Nazarite vow and do exactly
[1:37:12] what Jesus did
[1:37:14] absolutely but you can't we have to
[1:37:17] depend on God Amen okay that's why we
[1:37:21] cut our hair and the women don't cut
[1:37:22] their hair
[1:37:25] sorry I cut this thing off that's why we
[1:37:28] have that's why we our men we cut our
[1:37:30] hair and we women we don't cut their
[1:37:33] hair it's a vow that we take before God
[1:37:36] and I told him I said if you'll act like
[1:37:38] Jesus Christ you have your hair as long
[1:37:40] as you want to I had a brother come to
[1:37:42] me one time cuz I was I was preaching
