[4:54] see amen I want to see him too
[5:00] we have a lot of scripture reading this
[5:02] morning to do I have a few uh different
[5:04] places I'm going to read from let's turn
[5:06] first to Revelations chapter
[5:12] 3 now yesterday I got to share what I'm
[5:15] about to share with you with the
[5:17] chickens while I was cleaning their
[5:19] cute
[5:21] but it didn't do them any good but this
[5:24] morning I want to share it with some
[5:25] Eagles
[5:32] Revelation chapter 3 vers 15 and
[5:41] 16 I Know Thy works that thou art
[5:44] neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold
[5:46] or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[5:49] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[5:51] thee out of my mouth and I got I I was
[5:55] meditating on what causes people to be
[5:58] indifferent
[6:00] and with all the things that God has
[6:01] done for us in this day why are people
[6:04] indifferent with all the things that we
[6:06] have
[6:07] seen let's turn over to habac chapter
[6:15] 2 now habac up was an interesting
[6:19] Prophet maybe the only Prophet that I
[6:21] know of that in his first chapter he
[6:24] inquired of God why he wasn't punishing
[6:28] Israel and he was
[6:30] he was so zealous for God that he wanted
[6:32] to know why God was it seemed to him
[6:36] like God was being overly lenient with
[6:39] the people so in habac 2 verse 1 and 4
[6:43] he said I will stand upon my watch and
[6:45] set me upon the tower and will watch to
[6:48] see what he will say unto me and what I
[6:51] shall answer when I am
[6:53] reproved and the Lord answered me and
[6:55] said write the vision and make it plain
[6:58] upon tables that he may run that readeth
[7:01] it and you know this is often quoted
[7:04] that that he may that that he that
[7:07] readeth may run but it's the that he may
[7:11] run that readeth you read first and then
[7:13] it's Quicken to you then you understand
[7:16] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[7:19] time but at the end it shall speak and
[7:22] not lie though it Terry wait for it
[7:25] because it will surely come it will not
[7:29] AR behold his soul which is lifted up is
[7:33] not upright in him but the just shall
[7:36] live by his faith amen and then I wanted
[7:39] to go the last scripture to read before
[7:43] you can be seated is Proverbs chapter
[7:47] 29 and that is 29 Verse 18 where it says
[7:52] where there is no vision the people
[7:55] perish but he that keepeth the law happy
[7:59] is he
[8:01] and you know what I did I forgot to pray
[8:02] before I read the scripture so let's
[8:04] pray
[8:05] now Lord Jesus we thank you for your
[8:08] grace to us Lord to come before you and
[8:10] be able to read your word Lord and Lord
[8:13] you've given us the ability to with our
[8:15] eyes to read your word Lord but it won't
[8:17] do us any good if you don't come and
[8:18] Quicken it to us and cause us to give us
[8:21] to give us the understanding of what
[8:23] we're reading Lord if we don't
[8:25] understand Lord then maybe we'll grow
[8:27] slothful and and indifferent towards the
[8:30] things that you've done Lord Jesus but
[8:32] help us Lord that you'll open our eyes
[8:35] to see the things that you've done in
[8:36] this day see the things that you're
[8:38] doing right now Lord not far off but the
[8:40] things that are being made manifest
[8:42] right in our lives in our midst Lord
[8:44] Jesus and I pray oh God Lord my words
[8:47] will fall to the ground Lord but you
[8:49] said that your words would never never
[8:51] pass away that they would accomplish the
[8:54] purpose that they were set forth to do
[8:55] Lord I pray God that you Lord quick my
[8:59] mouth Lord Quicken My Heart Lord to say
[9:02] your words and Quicken these people's
[9:04] ears and their hearts Lord to receive it
[9:06] Lord Jesus as you would give it out Lord
[9:09] and I pray God that you'll bless the
[9:11] service Lord I pray in the name of the
[9:13] Lord Jesus Christ you may be
[9:18] seated I I I'm I'm a little oldfashioned
[9:21] I I I still believe there's three things
[9:23] you need to bring with you you need to
[9:25] bring to church with you and you know
[9:27] the first thing that we often forget to
[9:29] bring is our
[9:31] s and
[9:34] and and uh the the next thing we should
[9:37] bring is our sword you know I know we
[9:39] have all the the modern Technologies and
[9:41] things but you know it's still important
[9:43] to be able to just take that old rusty
[9:45] Bible and and uh you know a lot of the
[9:48] things I I'll talk about are maybe
[9:51] you've heard before and that's one of
[9:53] the the mockeries that a Christian Bears
[9:55] today is you reading the same old Bible
[9:58] you're listening to the same old tapes
[10:00] the same things that you you're reading
[10:03] the same things that have been said over
[10:04] and over but the question I want to ask
[10:07] is these same things that you've heard
[10:09] over and over have they been quickened
[10:11] to you and that that's what causes you
[10:13] to not be indifferent and the third
[10:16] thing that you bring I I believe that
[10:18] you must bring with you bring yourself
[10:20] and your sword and the third thing is
[10:22] that you bring your little portion of
[10:24] the pillar of fire you might say this
[10:26] morning I don't have that portion of the
[10:28] pillar of Fire well there is a fountain
[10:31] that's flowing from from Calvary that
[10:34] where you can come freely and receive it
[10:36] it's a free gift to everyone I think
[10:39] that's brother brandom talked about how
[10:41] that's one of the hardest things to get
[10:43] across to people is that God the
[10:45] everpresent God is here that to get
[10:49] people to realize that he is here and
[10:52] that he is with the
[10:55] people bless sir that the price has been
[10:59] paid if there's anything in the word
[11:01] that can make you realize that you are
[11:03] saved by his grace and not something
[11:06] that you have done then that I believe
[11:08] that will Quicken something in us and
[11:10] cause us to run the race more diligently
[11:15] it's not something that you've done it's
[11:17] not something that you have to feel but
[11:18] it's something that he already did he
[11:20] already paid the
[11:22] price and habach was talking about
[11:25] running he was talking about running
[11:28] right if you can if the vision has been
[11:31] written so that you can read it and you
[11:33] read it and catch the vision and then go
[11:37] forth then you can run you know Paul
[11:39] talked about in many places
[11:42] about how how we should run a race and
[11:45] just to paraphrase how Paul put it he
[11:47] said we should run like we're the only
[11:49] one running because there's only when
[11:51] when you run a natural race there's only
[11:53] one person that's going to win that race
[11:56] that's how we should run that race
[11:59] and I this race when you run a race a
[12:04] race has rules you got to stay on the
[12:07] track you got to stay between the lines
[12:09] or however the race is organized you
[12:12] can't just start the race and then cut
[12:14] across to the field and and and uh
[12:17] straight to the finish line but you've
[12:19] got to you've got to run according to
[12:21] the rules and the race of God has rules
[12:23] to it you've got to run according to his
[12:26] rules or you will be
[12:28] disqualified and the rules don't say
[12:30] that you've got to be extra special good
[12:32] to be saved that you got to and I think
[12:35] maybe sometimes when we look at this I
[12:36] know th works that thou art neither cold
[12:38] nor hot and I'll get into the you know
[12:40] what brother Brandon said in a second
[12:41] but we think oh if I've got to be really
[12:45] really good to be saved or if you're
[12:47] really really bad that's how you're lost
[12:49] now I remember when 911 happened in the
[12:52] uh the World Trade Towers were destroyed
[12:55] uh everybody at work was talking about
[12:57] how there were so many people in heaven
[12:59] that day why because that they gave
[13:01] their life in 9/11 I'm sure that there
[13:03] were many good people that day there
[13:05] were many people that live their
[13:08] lives those those people that that were
[13:11] in the cockpit that the Arabs from
[13:14] overseas thought that they were doing a
[13:15] service to God they thought that they
[13:17] were living right that many people that
[13:19] with a conviction in their in their life
[13:22] to to go do good deeds but it's not by
[13:25] our own righteousness that we're saved
[13:26] it's by his righteousness
[13:29] and that I I think that should make us
[13:31] one of the happiest people we should be
[13:34] so happy to know that it's not based
[13:36] upon something that I do that if I slip
[13:39] up and maybe you know I think sometimes
[13:42] we think that if somebody gets a little
[13:43] temper tantrum at us you know maybe we
[13:46] disqualify them and put them out of the
[13:48] race if somebody uh looks at us the
[13:51] wrong way or doesn't shake our hand when
[13:53] we're coming in the door that we put
[13:55] them out and disqualify them but that's
[13:57] not the qualification it's not what you
[14:00] have done it's what God has
[14:04] done and so the race has rules oh yeah
[14:09] in 1 Corinthians 9:24 Paul said know ye
[14:12] not that they which run in a race run
[14:14] all but one receiveth a prize so run
[14:17] that ye may obtain run that you may
[14:20] obtain we'll talk a little bit later
[14:22] about what it looks like when you're
[14:24] running and I think uh it looks maybe a
[14:27] little bit different than what you would
[14:29] think we look at some examples in
[14:31] scripture and this whole race the race
[14:34] of God is governed by a principle of
[14:38] love you know what draws me down the
[14:40] race what pulls me is God's love for me
[14:44] amen and what propels me is my love for
[14:47] God it's love that runs the race
[14:51] and and my my wife is Romanian and U
[14:55] there's a Romanian legend about this
[14:58] fell it's actually not a legend it's a
[15:00] true story about this fell named Vlad
[15:03] shees and Vlad shees ruled Romania his
[15:07] por he had a little portion of Romania
[15:08] he ruled it with an Iron Fist and he was
[15:11] legendary for taking anyone that
[15:13] disagreed with him and putting them on a
[15:15] stake and he would take whole armies
[15:17] that disagreed with him that came to
[15:19] fight if he won the battle he would take
[15:21] the entire Army and cover hillsides with
[15:23] people put on Stakes all around and the
[15:26] Germans the German name for him was
[15:28] dracul and that's where the modern-day
[15:30] Dracula came from this was a real fell
[15:33] and he had such a a blood lust it was
[15:35] written about him that if any evil that
[15:37] vladish hated evil so much that if any
[15:40] evil was done in the land no matter how
[15:42] small or how great how uh whether it was
[15:46] to Vlad ches personally or just to some
[15:49] peasant on the street that Vlad chish
[15:51] would deal with an Iron Fist and he
[15:53] would kill that person and maybe put
[15:55] them up as an
[15:57] example on a steak
[16:00] so that everyone could see and and and
[16:03] he ran so he ran his whole country in
[16:06] fear everyone was afraid to move
[16:09] certainly nobody nobody theft was very
[16:12] low and everybody was was Marching In
[16:16] you know just perfect Accord with you
[16:18] know but they were living in fear and
[16:21] you know that's not the way that God
[16:23] runs his kingdom that's not the way I
[16:26] want to run my house I want my children
[16:28] to come to God because they see my love
[16:31] for them and God's love for them not
[16:33] because that somebody tells them if you
[16:35] don't read your Bible you're going to
[16:37] hell or because they lay down an iron
[16:39] fist but this race has got to be run by
[16:42] love and you know love bears with one
[16:45] another I I think I I was thinking my
[16:47] wife and I joke about how when we first
[16:49] came to this church I don't know if many
[16:51] of you remember but we were so backwards
[16:53] that the first time we came to this
[16:55] church that was a little uh that was
[16:57] back when the bathroom was were right
[16:59] here and we we got here and we heard
[17:02] singing from inside but we couldn't tell
[17:04] where the front door was and we were so
[17:07] backwards that we didn't come in we
[17:09] thought well we come we'll come back
[17:11] later and get here extra early so we'll
[17:13] find out and you know just through the
[17:16] great through the life of a Christian
[17:18] many Christians are at different stages
[17:20] and we bear with one another we're not
[17:22] uh we don't expect uh just a new
[17:25] Christian to have the same uh to be at
[17:29] the same stage as as a Christian further
[17:32] along and we bear with one another
[17:34] because we love one another you
[17:37] know the if you look at the Ten
[17:40] Commandments that's why Jesus said the
[17:42] first commandment is to love the Lord
[17:43] thy God with all thy heart and all th
[17:45] soul and the second command commandment
[17:46] after that is to love the children of
[17:49] God I'm paraphrasing because if you take
[17:51] the the the Ten Commandments and divide
[17:53] them up into groups of five the first
[17:54] five are about loving God and the last
[17:56] five are about loving his children how
[17:58] can can you love the children of how can
[18:00] you love God if God's attributes are
[18:02] manifested in his children and you don't
[18:04] love his children how can you love God
[18:06] if you don't love his children so we
[18:09] love one another that proves that we
[18:11] love
[18:12] God and uh you know we're we're keeping
[18:15] some little goats for some people these
[18:17] two these two little goats and they've
[18:19] been bottle fed and they uh to be honest
[18:22] they're a little bit aggravating because
[18:24] they follow you around everywhere
[18:26] because they've been loved on so much
[18:28] and how I I believe that's what if you
[18:32] show One Another Love then it just
[18:35] causes us to cleave together and you can
[18:37] just like that story of brother brand
[18:39] telling the story of the bears looking
[18:40] the honey off one another that they just
[18:42] you just want to get around one another
[18:43] and lick that honey off you know brother
[18:45] BR talked about how when when back in
[18:47] the old days when they would have to
[18:48] leave church and they just couldn't
[18:50] hardly get away from each other and I I
[18:53] I feel like that sometimes on Wednesday
[18:54] night when we get around and and after
[18:56] church usually lately I'm always the
[18:59] last to leave because I I don't know if
[19:02] you feel the same way about me but I
[19:04] love you and I I hope that you cons
[19:16] that
[19:17] bless so you're not hot you're not saved
[19:21] because of how scriptural you are or how
[19:25] much you know about God's Bible you're
[19:27] not lost because you got a little temper
[19:29] you got mad at somebody somebody didn't
[19:31] Shake Your Hands you got your feelings
[19:33] hurt because you have an account on
[19:34] Facebook or you did something that
[19:37] somebody uh uh just gets a little hurt
[19:40] feelings at but you're saved because
[19:43] Romans 8:33 Paul said who shall lay
[19:45] anything to the charge of God's it's
[19:48] Christ that justifi it's God that
[19:51] justifi and you know this whole thing
[19:54] now look at this what this Proclamation
[19:58] this prophecy that John saw that he was
[20:02] looking down Through the Ages maybe
[20:05] think about how John must have felt when
[20:07] he looked and saw the state he maybe he
[20:10] would he would think that as the word
[20:12] progressed and grew and grew and the
[20:16] Original Seed began to be bear fruit and
[20:19] come forth in the latter days and this
[20:23] day that surely the people would be so
[20:26] excited so
[20:29] just prayer for all the time in church
[20:32] all the time ready to come around God's
[20:34] word all the time just anxious to hear
[20:38] what God has to say and maybe imagine
[20:41] his surprise to see this prophesy
[20:43] prophecy about leosa that in this day
[20:47] that there would even be a problem about
[20:49] being hot or cold or lukewarm and you
[20:52] know really the problem isn't cold the
[20:54] problem isn't with the cold because God
[20:58] you think God doesn't love Sinners but
[21:00] God Specializes in Sinners there's a he
[21:03] loves Sinners those are the ones that he
[21:05] can deal with think about the woman at
[21:08] the wh and Rahab and and the woman that
[21:10] washed his feet and just all these
[21:13] people that the world had disqualified
[21:16] they had put them out of the race and
[21:18] maybe many of us here today the world
[21:20] had disqualified and put us out of the
[21:22] race but God Specializes in Saving the
[21:25] Lost saving the one that's the one of
[21:27] the qualities of a sheep is when a sheep
[21:29] is lost it has no idea what to do but
[21:33] God Specializes in leading little lost
[21:35] sheep back to him amen and uh so I I
[21:40] think
[21:42] about you know how John must have fa and
[21:45] maybe he didn't get the full import of
[21:48] what this was but Thou Art neither cold
[21:51] nor hot
[21:52] right so then because Thou Art lukewarm
[21:56] and neither cold nor hot I will spew out
[21:58] of my
[21:59] mouth you know the first lukewarm
[22:02] Christian yes thank you brother the
[22:05] first lukewarm Christian was was Cain
[22:09] back in the Garden of Eden and remember
[22:12] how they both they both came to offer
[22:14] their
[22:19] sacrifices I feel like a Thirsty
[22:24] Camel they both came to offer their
[22:27] sacrifices
[22:28] and give to God their praise and offer
[22:31] to him sacrifice out of what they felt
[22:34] was right right and Cain came with a
[22:38] sacrifice from his own hands that he had
[22:40] worked out from his own hands chilling
[22:42] the ground something that he felt like
[22:44] that he had to do but Abel looked toward
[22:48] that the the mercy seed and and thought
[22:52] there's what can I do there's nothing
[22:54] that I can do I believe Abel had a
[22:57] greater Revelation than just what Adam
[22:59] and Eve did but he had a revelation that
[23:01] there is nothing in myself worthy of
[23:04] Salvation there's nothing in myself
[23:06] worthy what if I what if Abel just as a
[23:08] justen to as example what if from the
[23:10] day he was born to the day he had that
[23:13] Revelation lived just a perfect clean
[23:15] life never looked after women never uh
[23:19] drank wine never did anything but still
[23:21] he was born the wrong way he come into
[23:24] the world wrong he came into the world
[23:26] speaking lies
[23:28] right and he had uh he had to be born
[23:32] again even though back then he couldn't
[23:34] be because the Holy Ghost had not come
[23:36] Jesus said the sacrifice has not come
[23:38] yet but so Abel came with a sacrifice
[23:42] and Cain came with the works of his own
[23:44] hands and you can trace that all the way
[23:47] down through scripture the ungodly and
[23:50] the hot the hot and the lukewarm right
[23:55] and then you know when
[23:57] Jesus when Jesus Jesus came to the
[23:59] Earth and came in a way that they didn't
[24:02] expect him to
[24:03] come and the Jews the ones that the
[24:06] holiest people should have accepted him
[24:08] and should have seen who he was but they
[24:10] failed to recognize the revealed word
[24:13] made known in their midst walking among
[24:16] them and even though he said I didn't do
[24:18] this in a secret in a secret way I
[24:20] didn't do this in secret but I made it
[24:22] was a public show I healed everyone
[24:24] right in your synagogues I I uh taught
[24:27] right in in front of you but they turned
[24:29] it down because they didn't recognize
[24:32] what was being presented to them
[24:36] and they looked more toward their own
[24:39] works and you know brother Brandon in
[24:41] one place he says that he spewed them
[24:42] out but but you before God spews you out
[24:46] you must spew him out first you got to
[24:49] Pew put him out first he never puts
[24:52] anyone out before per first they put him
[24:55] out of their denominational system out
[24:57] of their put him out of out of their own
[25:00] ideas and that's exactly what's
[25:03] happening again in this last day as he
[25:05] turned from the Jew the Jews to the
[25:07] Gentiles now he's about to turn back
[25:10] from the Gentiles to the Jews because he
[25:13] sees they're not able the Gentiles won't
[25:16] accept it and are not able to make his
[25:18] word become
[25:21] manifest so
[25:24] uh you know I the world wants you to
[25:27] think
[25:29] there's two extremes here hot and cold
[25:32] and the world wants you to think that
[25:33] there's that the world is not in black
[25:36] and white but the way God looks at
[25:38] things it is black and white you're
[25:41] either saved or you're lost you're
[25:43] either drunk or you're sober and he even
[25:46] said there's only two factions in
[25:47] Hebrews chapter 7 uh paragraph 3:18
[25:50] there's only two factions that is a
[25:52] Believer or an unbeliever that's a
[25:55] Justified person or a sinner that's all
[25:57] if you're an believer you're a sinner no
[25:59] matter how good you are how much you go
[26:01] to church or even if you're a preacher
[26:03] you're still an
[26:06] unbeliever and it's not it's not that um
[26:10] the world the the CH this this Christian
[26:13] race that we're running is not Shades of
[26:16] Gray where you can dabble in the things
[26:17] of the world and then come back and
[26:19] Dabble in the things of God a little bit
[26:21] remember Lot's wife is the parable that
[26:24] she look back at what the at the things
[26:26] that she came out of that come out of
[26:28] the denominational system the the ideas
[26:31] of man and come out and then go desire
[26:34] to go back into your own man-made ideas
[26:36] and
[26:38] things and so I wanted to talk a little
[26:41] bit about what causes us to to be on
[26:46] fire for
[26:47] God and before I get into
[26:50] that I want to read a little a little
[26:53] testimony that I found uh I was reading
[26:55] the the voice of God website they had a
[26:58] a little um the people send in different
[27:00] testimonies and and this fed fit in real
[27:03] well with with uh the topic and he was
[27:07] telling about when he was a little boy
[27:09] how he met brother brandham and what
[27:11] brother brandham told him he said
[27:15] um brother Brandon prayed for me on June
[27:18] 26 19 1963 in the park in Hot Springs
[27:21] Arkansas I was 8 years old at the time
[27:24] but I remember every detail like it was
[27:26] yesterday I was suffering with swelling
[27:28] and pain in my jaw not knowing what was
[27:30] causing it I was sitting on a picnic
[27:33] bench on a picnic table at the
[27:35] campground where the meetings were going
[27:36] to take place when brother brandom and
[27:39] brother Billy Paul drove up they came
[27:42] over pretty close to where I was and
[27:43] were talking to some brothers the trash
[27:46] men walked up to get the trash and
[27:47] started talking to brother Brenham about
[27:49] the meeting he stood there and explained
[27:51] to them about the Holy Ghost and about
[27:53] the godhead and invited them to the
[27:56] meeting brother brandom uh it says in
[27:58] quotes brother Ram mentions this on the
[28:00] tape about the trash man he stopped
[28:01] talking to them and Whirled around and
[28:04] looked at me he said excuse me uh
[28:07] Brethren I want you to notice the whole
[28:09] time I have been talking this boy has
[28:12] sat here and has not took his eyes off
[28:13] me he said I have a boy your age he
[28:16] would not have sat here this long if he
[28:18] was here he would have every tree
[28:20] climbed and every Rock turned over but
[28:22] you have sit here and not taken your
[28:24] eyes off me he said you know in this
[28:28] life we have two sets of teeth you have
[28:31] your baby teeth they will rot and go
[28:33] away then you have your permanent teeth
[28:36] they will rot and go away then he placed
[28:39] his finger on my chest and pointed up
[28:42] and said but when you get over there you
[28:45] will have a set that never grow
[28:48] old he said Do you believe if I pray for
[28:51] you the Lord will heal you I said yes
[28:53] sir he placed his hands around my hands
[28:56] and said a little prayer when he was
[28:58] done he took two of his fingers and
[28:59] placed them on my cheek and said when
[29:01] you get back home have your mother and
[29:03] father take you to the dentist and have
[29:05] those two uppers removed the Lord healed
[29:07] me instantly the pain and swelling was
[29:09] gone after the meetings were over and we
[29:11] got back home mother asked Dad should we
[29:13] take him to the dentist dad said yes sir
[29:16] that's what brother brandom said do my
[29:18] parents didn't say anything to the
[29:19] dentist about what happened at the
[29:21] meeting I climbed up in the chair for my
[29:23] exam the dentist looked at my teeth and
[29:25] said looks like like those two uppers
[29:27] need to come out so I will never forget
[29:30] the day I met the prophet of God I thank
[29:33] God for the prophet he sent to the bride
[29:35] of Christ his spirit is still among us
[29:38] today now that's a little testimony
[29:41] about a little boy that met brother
[29:43] Branham and brother brandham gave him a
[29:46] vision of where he was going one day and
[29:50] that's uh that's what caught my
[29:53] attention one day I was going in the
[29:56] wrong direction and you maybe you heard
[29:58] of my testimony I kind of gave a little
[29:59] a while back in one of the first Sunday
[30:02] school lessons that one day I took a
[30:04] walk with my dad and he began to talk
[30:06] about the future home and I caught the
[30:09] vision and it struck something in me I
[30:11] didn't receive the Holy Ghost then but
[30:13] it caught something in me that caused me
[30:15] to have just a fire in my life to read
[30:19] and study and and ever since then the
[30:22] fire is not quenched uh brother Joe or
[30:25] Brother Anderson if you pull up the
[30:27] definition of lukewarm
[30:29] is lukewarm in the Greek Lexicon the
[30:33] definition of lukewarm is comes from the
[30:36] Greek
[30:37] clearos which uh is a metaphor for the
[30:41] condition of the Soul wretchedly
[30:44] fluctuating between a torpor and a
[30:46] fervor of love in other words an
[30:49] airplane Christian one minute you're
[30:51] really on fire for God and the next
[30:53] you're just uh it's just hard to hardly
[30:56] get you out of bed to to say but you
[30:59] know when Abel offered his sacrifice and
[31:02] the fire of God came down and accepted
[31:05] it uh that's what really lights things
[31:08] up and was when God lights you up with
[31:10] the fire of God with a holy fire on the
[31:12] inside and now I want to talk about
[31:14] another little boy that uh caught the
[31:18] vision let me take a drink of water here
[31:28] that's one little
[31:29] boy that caught the
[31:31] vision and there was another little boy
[31:34] in the Old
[31:36] Testament and his he was the grandson of
[31:40] Aaron now
[31:42] Aaron we know Aaron had he had four
[31:46] sons and the first two sons Aaron was
[31:49] the high priest and the first two
[31:52] sons naboth and
[31:55] Abu uh I'm I think that's the first one
[31:59] I can't really read my
[32:02] handwriting na neud or and Abu anyway he
[32:05] had two sons that
[32:08] uh they instead of remember in the Old
[32:11] Testament when the first time Moses
[32:13] brought a sacrifice to the Lord and He
[32:16] instead of lighting the fire with a fire
[32:18] that he struck
[32:19] himself the fire of God came down and
[32:22] consumed the sacrifice and ever since
[32:25] that day they kept the fire from The
[32:27] Altar and and kept it sacred so that
[32:30] that original fire never went out but it
[32:33] would continuously be used to as to
[32:36] receive the sacrifice and these two
[32:38] oldest sons of el Aaron they brought a a
[32:43] fire that they got from somewhere else
[32:45] that they tried to manufacture their own
[32:47] self just like Cain tried to manufacture
[32:50] something and they brought it and
[32:52] because they brought uh This Strange
[32:55] Fire they were consumed instead of their
[32:58] sacrifice and so
[33:00] now the ones that should have been the
[33:02] high priest are out of the picture and
[33:04] the Eleazar becomes the high priest now
[33:07] we know Eleazar when they came to cadesh
[33:09] Bara Eleazar must have been very young
[33:12] because Eleazar put uh Joshua in he he
[33:17] was with Moses when Joshua was
[33:20] established and when they came into the
[33:22] promised land he helped Joshua put
[33:25] everyone into the place where they
[33:26] should be so he came came into the
[33:28] promised land so he must have been the
[33:30] cut off was 20 years of age and older so
[33:32] he must have been under 20 years of age
[33:35] so elasia we know was a pretty young man
[33:38] and I can I can identify with him you
[33:41] know having to get up before the people
[33:43] and you know make a sacrifice and do all
[33:46] the duties of the high priest and
[33:47] everything and uh I'm sure it must have
[33:50] been very scary that first time to to
[33:52] get up and and and speak before the
[33:55] people oh yeah and uh so
[33:58] AER had a little son and his name was
[34:02] Phineas and Phineas was raised up in the
[34:06] message he was raised up around the the
[34:10] prophet and around the he was put into
[34:13] this environment where his whole life
[34:16] was raised up and told these stories I'm
[34:18] sure his mother told him all these
[34:20] stories about you know we we listen to
[34:22] the prophet's life story well Moses had
[34:25] a life story too and I'm sure that
[34:27] eleazer Eleazar was a God-fearing man
[34:30] and I'm sure that Eleazar and his wife
[34:32] set their children down and told them
[34:34] about the stories of Moses and one story
[34:37] I think they might have told was how
[34:39] Moses when he was when he was a little
[34:41] fellow he he his mama set him on her
[34:45] knee you know cuz his his his real
[34:47] mother was the the wet nurse for Moses
[34:51] and so she told him who he was and told
[34:54] him about how when she pulled him when
[34:56] when when she laid him in that little
[34:57] basket of the bull rushes that she saw
[35:00] something special in him and she saw she
[35:02] believed that one day he was going to be
[35:04] the deliverer and that surely God was
[35:06] with him that caused him to be moved
[35:10] right into the pharaoh's house and be
[35:12] brought up in Pharaoh's house and you
[35:14] know I believe that Moses believed that
[35:17] but he tried to do like Cain and tried
[35:19] to bring it to pass with his own by his
[35:21] own power and one day he saw an Egyptian
[35:24] fighting with an Israelite and he waited
[35:26] till everybody was gone and he looked to
[35:28] the left the Bible says he looked to the
[35:30] left and he looked to the right and he
[35:32] made made sure that everybody was gone
[35:34] and then he killed the Egyptian and
[35:36] buried him into the Sands we try to bury
[35:38] our own sins our own pasts but that
[35:41] won't work does it that doesn't work so
[35:44] found he he thought that he wouldn't be
[35:46] found out
[35:48] but the next day he saw two Israelites
[35:52] fighting and he said to the one that was
[35:54] smiting the other he said why are you
[35:56] smiting your Israel your your brother
[35:57] you're supposed to love one another and
[35:59] he said are you going to who made you a
[36:01] ruler and a judge over us are you going
[36:03] to kill me the way you killed that
[36:05] Egyptian and so he ran into the
[36:07] Wilderness and when he got to the
[36:09] Wilderness his that Vision that his mama
[36:12] gave him that his parents had told him
[36:15] about who he was began to diem and began
[36:19] to die off maybe your vision today is
[36:23] getting a little bit dim the vision of
[36:25] who you are and what you've been raised
[36:28] for what you're doing here
[36:30] today and
[36:32] uh brother brand tells a story about how
[36:36] that he got so comfortable in life he
[36:38] got his house paid off just telling a
[36:41] story like that he got so comfortable
[36:43] and situated but one day he saw a pillar
[36:46] of fire burning in a bush and he met the
[36:49] same fire that consumed Abel's sacrifice
[36:53] and from that day on there was a fire
[36:54] kindled in him because he saw he found
[36:58] out that God was real that he wasn't
[37:01] just a bunch of Creeds and dogmas that
[37:04] God was alive and his heart was became
[37:07] on just as on fire as that fire that was
[37:10] in that
[37:11] bush that's what causes us to be on fire
[37:14] for God the fire of God in
[37:18] us and uh so we we know the story of how
[37:22] we went down into Egypt and they came
[37:24] out and they came to Kadesh Baria and uh
[37:29] that's where the the cut off was they
[37:31] began to uh God said not a one of you
[37:34] will cross over the to the River Jordan
[37:37] over death and unless you're under the
[37:39] age of 20 right and so I I believe that
[37:43] phish's parents told him these little
[37:48] stories they told him about the prophet
[37:51] they told him about how they were
[37:53] delivered how they came over the Red Sea
[37:56] they told him about how that the token
[37:58] had been applied to their door they had
[38:00] to apply the token that it was their
[38:02] door the L of their doorpost was covered
[38:04] by the shed blood and they told him all
[38:06] these things and so he caught the vision
[38:10] of where he was headed he caught the
[38:13] true interpretation of let my people go
[38:16] and I believe a lot of them around
[38:18] around him believe that let my people go
[38:21] was the end of the story that they would
[38:22] just come out and they would circle
[38:24] around the Wilderness for a while and
[38:26] they would be tended I believe that's
[38:28] why when they got to cadesh Bara they
[38:30] didn't go over because they didn't catch
[38:32] the vision of what their purpose was of
[38:35] who they were and what God wanted to do
[38:38] with their life and they failed to
[38:40] realize their purpose in life but
[38:44] Phineas caught the full vision that it
[38:47] wasn't just to come out but they were to
[38:49] go in to go on to to take a a body
[38:53] change let me say it like
[38:56] that he he caught the vision of what the
[38:59] real Ten Commandments were all about and
[39:03] he didn't believe that he was born to
[39:04] just be part of an
[39:07] organization Lord and so just as they
[39:12] got now think about John looking down
[39:15] through time and seeing just as we're
[39:18] about the bride of Christ is just about
[39:21] to cross the threshold over into Glory
[39:24] just just as we're about to cross over
[39:28] then Satan comes and throws his last
[39:31] trick as what brother brandom said and
[39:35] they were just at the borderline they
[39:37] were camped on the other side of Jericho
[39:40] they were inside of Jericho and Jericho
[39:42] was just on the other side of the river
[39:44] Jordan and they had to cross over death
[39:48] and just as they were situated around
[39:51] then baac sees a Revival coming through
[39:53] the land he sees a people that were led
[39:56] by the spirit of God by the pillar of
[39:58] fire that they had an altar they had a a
[40:02] a lamb that was slain in their midst
[40:04] they had the sacrifice and they had
[40:07] signs and wonders following them and he
[40:08] said I'm not going to let that come into
[40:10] my
[40:11] territory and so what was interesting is
[40:15] that baac joined together with the
[40:18] midianites yeah and we know where Midian
[40:21] comes
[40:22] from it's it's real interesting
[40:26] because Moses was married to the
[40:29] daughter of the priest of Midian right
[40:32] the head man and so the midianites had
[40:35] been around the message they had heard
[40:37] about it even though maybe they wouldn't
[40:38] admit to listening to the tapes before
[40:40] they said their things on the
[40:48] radio they had been around they were
[40:50] well acquaint acquainted with the things
[40:53] of the message with the things of God
[40:56] but they were maybe jealous of what was
[40:59] going on and you know they even had a
[41:02] righteous lineage cuz they descended
[41:05] right back to Abraham not a Abraham they
[41:09] descended all the way back to Abraham
[41:12] and his second wife after Sarah died he
[41:14] married Cura and so they were children
[41:16] of Abraham too but they didn't they
[41:20] failed to believe the the signs and the
[41:25] Wonders and the manifested word that was
[41:27] revealed that was displayed right there
[41:29] in front of
[41:31] them and so baac and the moabites and
[41:35] the midianites joined together and they
[41:37] said let's go find the head man and we
[41:40] can get him to throw to to to curse
[41:43] these people and we know the story about
[41:45] how they they uh balum tried and tried
[41:48] because he was so eager to get paid he
[41:50] tried and tried to curse Israel but God
[41:54] uh every time he tried he he blessed he
[41:56] blessed
[41:58] Israel until finally
[42:01] he he convinced balam he said I'll tell
[42:05] you what if we can get their eye off the
[42:08] promise if we can get them off of what
[42:12] they're supposed to be doing even though
[42:15] they are right in sight of the promised
[42:17] land Jericho is just across the river
[42:20] the Rapture is just at hand if we can
[42:24] get their eye off the promise and their
[42:27] off the word the revealed word for their
[42:29] day and look instead of looking at the
[42:31] word look at their own man's own ideas
[42:35] things that man comes up with if we can
[42:37] get them to look at that then then we've
[42:40] got
[42:41] them and remember how the same thing
[42:45] happened in the Garden of Eden how Satan
[42:47] came down and he said I can't get into
[42:49] Adam so I have to get him to come out to
[42:52] me and he spoke to Eve he went to the to
[42:55] the weak spot and he spoke to Eve and
[42:57] they he CED them to come out to him and
[43:00] that's exactly what happened here they
[43:02] had the Mana they had the revealed word
[43:07] they had they were eat feasting on
[43:09] Christ that came down from heaven the
[43:11] revealed word for the hour but instead
[43:14] of that they got turned to eating what
[43:17] was offered to dead Idols
[43:22] sacrifices and so Satan's last trick was
[43:26] played
[43:28] and
[43:34] uh and then is when Phineas rose
[43:38] up
[43:40] now The Story Goes it's written in the
[43:45] Bible that Moses told the men of Israel
[43:47] to destroy all of the midianites go go
[43:51] find all the men that had joined
[43:53] yourself to this false Doctrine and
[43:55] killed them
[43:57] and all the men of Israel fell down and
[43:59] and prayed and and worshiped before God
[44:02] and and and were repenting and they were
[44:05] all falling down before the altar but
[44:08] only one stood up only one of them was
[44:12] uh let me back up and tell this story so
[44:17] uh z uh one of the Israelites Zim took
[44:22] one of the midianites into his tent and
[44:25] uh Phineas looked up and saw that and he
[44:28] was the only one they they were all they
[44:31] were all holy and Pious and repenting
[44:33] and bowing before the altar of the Lord
[44:36] and Moses and Aaron and everyone was
[44:38] standing there and you know Phineas
[44:39] didn't say he didn't consult with Moses
[44:42] about what he should do brother Moses do
[44:46] I really have the Holy Ghost do I really
[44:49] have an experience before I go and meet
[44:53] this challenge can you validate my
[44:54] personal experience but and experience
[44:57] is a personal relationship you have with
[45:00] God and you know Phineas neither did he
[45:04] he he didn't challenge Moses and he
[45:06] didn't say you know brother Moses if you
[45:09] had if we had had more Youth Services if
[45:11] we had done more things for people if we
[45:14] had had maybe if we had uh better coffee
[45:16] down in the lobby or or different things
[45:18] maybe more people would come and he
[45:21] didn't you know through the whole
[45:23] journey of the Israelites the Israelites
[45:25] had constantly criticized
[45:27] Moses that even though he was Vindicated
[45:30] over and over again as God's man God's
[45:34] man bringing the message for his day and
[45:36] they constantly ridiculed him but
[45:39] Phineas didn't do any of those things
[45:41] and and neither did he stay over long in
[45:44] prayer but he rose up to do the will of
[45:47] the Lord and you know that's what real
[45:49] love is we think love is drawing any all
[45:52] the the just whatever pollution and
[45:55] stuff to our bosom but love is obeying
[45:58] the will of God and Phineas rose up in
[46:01] obedience to the will of God he didn't
[46:02] have to consult and ask he knew on
[46:05] because he had heard he had read the
[46:08] message he had the table what was
[46:11] written on the tables of stone had
[46:13] become plain to him and he knew what he
[46:15] was raised up for he knew that they
[46:17] needed to go over into the promised land
[46:20] and he caught the
[46:21] vision and so he rose up and he went
[46:24] into the tent
[46:32] he went into the
[46:33] tent and slew her slew
[46:38] omry through the belly and
[46:41] omry I I found it was interesting what
[46:44] the name of omry the medanite girl was
[46:47] omry means my lie so Zim had taken a lie
[46:52] into his tent and so Phineas stood up
[46:55] and he he stood up to do the will of God
[46:58] and he saw this false Doctrine he saw
[47:00] the same thing that Abel saw that
[47:03] someone was confessing that they were a
[47:07] True Believer that they were claiming
[47:09] his name but they were not living the
[47:12] life that they were living the a life
[47:14] based on some other doctrine that they
[47:17] were living a life not based on the
[47:19] revelation of his word but based on
[47:22] something that
[47:24] uh Den a denominational
[47:27] idea and so he rose up and put plunged
[47:31] his dagger through her belly so that
[47:34] that seed would not come to would would
[47:37] not mature and
[47:39] produce it's written of Phineus in Psalm
[47:41] 10628 through 32 they joined themselves
[47:44] also into B peor and ate the sacrifices
[47:47] of the Dead thus they provoked him to
[47:50] anger with their inventions and the
[47:52] plague break in upon them then stood up
[47:55] Phineas and executed judgment and so the
[47:58] plague was stayed right and that was
[48:00] counted unto him for righteousness unto
[48:03] all generations forever more and so God
[48:06] gave Phineas the promise that forever
[48:08] more until until the priesthood finished
[48:12] at at Christ that Phineas and his
[48:15] lineage after him would always be priest
[48:18] before
[48:19] him and I I I'm thinking about
[48:23] how you know many of us have been raised
[48:26] up in the message the same way that
[48:28] Phineas was and the word has been around
[48:30] us we've been around these things all of
[48:32] our life but have we caught the vision
[48:35] have we caught what the prophet is
[48:37] saying and how do we catch what how can
[48:41] we catch what the prophet says unless a
[48:45] prophet would bring it and you know in
[48:48] Matthew 10:41 it's written he that
[48:51] receiveth a prophet in the name of a
[48:53] prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[48:56] and he that receiveth a righteous man in
[48:58] the name of a righteous man shall
[49:00] receive a righteous man's reward and we
[49:02] were talking in Sunday school last
[49:04] Sunday about the bearing forth fruits
[49:07] you know think about how a righteous man
[49:08] if you ever sat under someone that uh
[49:12] just set under the leaves the coolness
[49:15] and feel the virtue coming forth from
[49:17] them and as they tell you their
[49:19] Revelation what they understand God to
[49:21] be to them and it just causes you to
[49:26] catch something that makes you want to
[49:27] grow closer closer to God and and the
[49:31] same thing you know brother brandom said
[49:33] that Abraham knew what God's nature was
[49:37] because he was a friend with God and
[49:40] brother brandom explained this if you
[49:42] have if if you are somebody said what um
[49:47] what does it
[49:49] mean to to receive a a prophet in the
[49:53] name of a prophet what does all that
[49:55] mean and he he said if if they want to
[49:57] know what a prophet's reward is is to be
[49:59] a friend to the prophet now I I'd never
[50:03] even met brother
[50:04] brand how can I be his friend that's
[50:07] right because I've never walked with him
[50:10] but I know that he was a friend with God
[50:12] and he walked with God and he knew what
[50:14] God was all about when I listened to the
[50:17] tapes because he knew what God was about
[50:19] I knew what God was about and I can
[50:21] catch what he's bringing I can catch you
[50:24] know everything that everything that
[50:28] uh that brother brandham saw and God it
[50:31] was communicated down so that we could
[50:33] catch it and believe it and receive it
[50:36] so we can catch the vision Glory who is
[50:40] this 1959 brother brandham said he know
[50:43] talking about Abraham he he know the
[50:45] nature of God because he was a friend of
[50:47] God he know how to take him because he
[50:50] know that his promises no matter how
[50:52] foolish they looked or how simple they
[50:55] looked or how unreasonable they looked
[50:58] they were true because God said so and
[51:01] that settled it
[51:03] forever now what is a vision now we know
[51:07] brother brandham saw a vision he saw
[51:09] Visions right before and Bam described
[51:11] it very well he said my eyes are open
[51:13] and I see a picture right in front of me
[51:16] but now this Vision has to be
[51:18] communicated down and you know even when
[51:21] brother Brandon was seeing visions you
[51:23] know he said maybe one time he would see
[51:25] a strong arm and he would say you're
[51:26] name is Mrs Stout and so there was a
[51:29] there's a vision that's written on
[51:32] tables there there it's two-part there's
[51:34] a vision but there's also another part
[51:36] that it has to be interpreted it has to
[51:38] be made known and uh you know when he
[51:41] would in the prayer line he would reach
[51:42] out to people and he would let them see
[51:44] the bumps on his hands and he he could
[51:47] show them the bumps as in the
[51:49] discernment line but the person looking
[51:52] at the bumps had no idea what those
[51:54] bumps represented and how how would
[51:57] anyone have any idea what a series of
[51:59] bumps bumping up on his hand would would
[52:01] represent but because God was in the man
[52:04] and the spirit of discernment was in him
[52:06] he interpreted what the dots were and
[52:10] that's how a vision is you can the
[52:12] vision can be written on tables written
[52:15] in your Bible but it's also got to be
[52:17] interpreted and the only one that can
[52:19] interpret it is God in you amen glory so
[52:24] a vision is spiritual sight a Vision
[52:27] brother R said a vision is just
[52:28] repeating what he showed what he showed
[52:32] him and I can't just repeat it I've got
[52:35] to catch the vision it's got to be
[52:37] quickening
[52:39] me and uh so a vision is two parts the
[52:42] public and the revealed you know maybe
[52:45] think about how as you walk down the
[52:47] street you are a public Vision but
[52:51] unless it's interpreted no one will
[52:53] realize that you're the walking
[52:55] manifestation of God's word God's word
[52:58] made
[52:59] flesh but if you catch it now think
[53:01] about this brother brand talking about
[53:03] what what prayer how prayer is when you
[53:07] align your vision of what God wants you
[53:10] to do and wants you to be and and think
[53:13] about Joshua looking across Jericho and
[53:16] Phineas looking across toward the
[53:18] promised land that God wants you to grow
[53:22] up the stature of a perfect man that he
[53:24] wants these virtues to be born in you
[53:27] see he wants you to be to to grow in
[53:30] Grace and knowledge and if you can align
[53:32] the vision that God has for you in your
[53:35] life align it with your motives and
[53:37] objectives then how can it fail if you
[53:40] have the right motives and objectives
[53:43] right and uh you know when you come
[53:46] before God In Prayer what prayer really
[53:48] is is letting your eyes the things that
[53:51] you see in this life letting your eyes
[53:54] grow dim and the things of this this
[53:56] Earth just fall away and your eyesight
[53:59] switches from the things of the world to
[54:02] the things above and you begin to see
[54:04] things different you began to maybe that
[54:06] person that talked bad to you last week
[54:08] or the the other day when you get in
[54:10] prayer and get get under the fountain
[54:13] then that doesn't seem to matter so much
[54:15] because now you see things different
[54:18] don't forsake the family
[54:20] prayer and when you pray repeat back to
[54:24] God the vision that gave to you I love
[54:28] when I get in prayer I love to tell him
[54:29] what I believe I love to tell him that I
[54:33] love to tell him who I believe that he
[54:35] has made me by his grace he took uh
[54:38] somebody that wasn't even
[54:43] worthy and he made me worthy and I like
[54:47] to tell him that and thank him and tell
[54:49] him where I believe that I'm going and
[54:51] what I'm here on Earth to do and what my
[54:55] purpose in life is
[54:57] and then when you do that and meld your
[55:01] vision with your motive the right motive
[55:04] and objective then everything just comes
[55:07] perfectly in line and how can it fail
[55:10] how can you fail if you have need of
[55:11] healing and your motive and objective is
[55:14] right you say I God I want to be healed
[55:18] because not just to go out and sin and
[55:21] go out to the clubs and things but I
[55:22] want to be healed so that I can praise
[55:24] you more so that I can testify so that I
[55:27] can live a life worthy of the Gospel so
[55:29] I can give glory to your name and you
[55:32] know that that is the vision you know
[55:34] there's not one time in scripture where
[55:36] anyone ever came to Christ and said we
[55:39] will you heal me that he ever turned
[55:41] them away and if you can catch the
[55:43] vision and align it with your motives
[55:45] and objectives then he will bring it to
[55:47] pass watch him watch him do it every
[55:50] time now in uh 1952 thou knowest all
[55:55] things now see what prayer does
[55:58] paragraph e 17 prayer is not exactly
[56:01] bringing God down to man it's bringing
[56:04] man up to God see as you pray you lose
[56:08] you lose sight of these Earthly things
[56:11] you sway out into somewhere else Way
[56:13] Beyond and on and on and on till you
[56:16] become into his presence and then a
[56:19] faith that you have laid it out before
[56:21] God said now here here it is and I want
[56:24] to get well for this cause or I want you
[56:27] to do this for me for this cause I want
[56:30] you to heal me from this cancer or this
[56:32] TB or this anemia condition or whatever
[56:34] it is I will walk before you I will do
[56:37] everything I can I will give this
[56:39] testimony everywhere I go I will be
[56:42] happy to do that Lord and I will use my
[56:44] life not for myself I will use it for
[56:47] your glory to help others to see you and
[56:50] the message influence 1963 he said so if
[56:54] you'll set your mind and ey and motives
[56:57] and objectives in life on the right
[56:59] thing you've got to come out on the
[57:01] right thing you can't fail think how
[57:04] powerful that is you can't fail that's
[57:08] the only way no
[57:11] matter no matter how much you're tempted
[57:13] to do the other side turn your head from
[57:16] it and do what's right and you know
[57:18] you're right you feel better and you are
[57:20] better and that's just all there is to
[57:22] it you got you're going to come out
[57:24] right you start going with
[57:26] you're not you're not going to be going
[57:28] north you're going to be going west and
[57:30] that's the same way it is and right and
[57:33] wrong let's read another one I have
[57:35] heard but now I see
[57:37] 1965 and you cannot ask in faith unless
[57:41] there's a real objective to that to be
[57:43] in the will of God see if you want to be
[57:45] well what do you want to be well for see
[57:49] if you want to be healed what's the
[57:50] reason you want to be healed what are
[57:52] you telling God what do you want to do
[57:54] with your life when you get heal see
[57:57] there's got to be you've got to have a
[57:59] motive and objective and they have to be
[58:01] right according to the will of God and
[58:04] then when the faith is revealed to you
[58:06] and God by his Sovereign Grace places
[58:08] that faith in there then it's over see
[58:12] now see
[58:14] now I want to tell you a little story
[58:17] about how one time my motives and
[58:19] objectives were aligned right with the
[58:24] vision excuse me now you've heard the
[58:27] story told about how brother random
[58:28] talked about
[58:30] how that he if you have faith enough
[58:34] that he can put your pocket knife in
[58:36] your pocket he can move it where you
[58:38] need it to be now not as a magic trick
[58:41] not as a show but if you need it and one
[58:44] morning I was going I was leaving the
[58:46] house for work and I couldn't it was
[58:48] just pouring down rain and I
[58:52] have I have probably a 10-minute walk
[58:55] from the subway station to work and
[58:57] before I had walked that many times
[58:59] before where I would uh one time I
[59:02] walked at in the security guards were
[59:04] laughing at me because I was so drenched
[59:06] I was just completely soaked and I and
[59:09] so that morning you know I believe that
[59:12] God Specializes in Saving the Lost
[59:15] whether it's your family or or myself or
[59:20] anyone L you know God saved me he can
[59:22] save you and uh and the think whenever
[59:27] we have something missing in our family
[59:29] we always gather around and just say a
[59:33] little prayer because God will find it I
[59:36] don't know where it is but he does
[59:37] because he knows all things so that
[59:40] morning I just prayed God I need the
[59:42] rain was coming down I said I need my
[59:45] umbrella and I don't want to walk
[59:47] through that I had a definite motive and
[59:51] objective and I believed that God would
[59:54] bring it to pass but I was walking out I
[59:57] I searched throughout the whole house I
[59:59] searched everywhere and I couldn't find
[1:00:01] it and I was going to be late for work
[1:00:02] so I walked out of the house and the
[1:00:04] only umbrella I could find was my wife's
[1:00:06] pink
[1:00:07] umbrella so that is the umbrella that I
[1:00:10] grabbed and I I I walked with that pink
[1:00:13] umbrella into work and I was sitting
[1:00:16] there at work and I had I had taken my
[1:00:19] laptop out of the little bag and I put
[1:00:21] it in my docking station and got
[1:00:22] everything set up and it that that
[1:00:25] particular morning morning I had got to
[1:00:26] work real early way before everyone else
[1:00:29] and I was there all alone by myself and
[1:00:31] I was just thinking about the things of
[1:00:32] God and all of a sudden just something
[1:00:35] spoke to me not a all a voice but from
[1:00:38] within my heart and it said what about
[1:00:40] that
[1:00:42] umbrella cuz I had asked God to find my
[1:00:46] umbrella not my wife's and here I was at
[1:00:50] work I wasn't at home and I knew that I
[1:00:53] didn't have the umbrella was not at work
[1:00:57] and I said I don't know where it is but
[1:01:00] I know that you are more than able to
[1:01:03] find it because I believe your word and
[1:01:08] I don't remember exactly what I said but
[1:01:10] I I made a little confession of faith
[1:01:13] and that same voice that spoke to me and
[1:01:15] said where is your umbrella said look in
[1:01:17] your
[1:01:18] bag I had just taken my laptop out of
[1:01:21] the bag I had just looked in there and
[1:01:24] it was there was nothing in there
[1:01:26] and I looked in the bag and my umbrella
[1:01:28] was in the bag it had not been in there
[1:01:33] before I don't know where it came from
[1:01:35] or how it I do know where it came from
[1:01:38] it came from the god of Glory that moved
[1:01:41] it there based on my faith because I had
[1:01:44] caught the vision and I had a motive and
[1:01:46] objective you know I I took that
[1:01:48] umbrella out of the
[1:01:49] bag and I I was so I could not believe
[1:01:53] what had happened and so I took I took
[1:01:56] about 10 pictures with my little camera
[1:01:58] and if anybody doubts me I took a
[1:02:00] picture where I tried to put my laptop
[1:02:03] and the umbrella in the case at the same
[1:02:04] time and they will not fit I can I can
[1:02:08] bring you those pictures if you want to
[1:02:09] find it
[1:02:12] Hallelujah but M your motives and
[1:02:15] objectives with your motives with the
[1:02:18] vision and God will bring it to pass
[1:02:20] every time you can rest your faith on it
[1:02:22] because he promised it you can rest your
[1:02:24] faith on Mark 16 that if you lay hands
[1:02:27] on the sick they will recover you can
[1:02:29] rest your faith on on that little
[1:02:31] promise that where the twos and the
[1:02:33] threes are GA together in my name they
[1:02:35] that I will be in their midst you can
[1:02:37] rest your faith on those
[1:02:39] promises so uh just a little bit of time
[1:02:43] we got left I want to maybe take a look
[1:02:46] at what does zeal look like what does
[1:02:49] real Zeal for God look
[1:02:52] like and maybe a lot of times we think
[1:02:55] that zeal looks like hurrying to and fro
[1:02:58] until we're falling asleep at stop lies
[1:03:02] just going backwards and forth running
[1:03:04] to and fro doing good works until we
[1:03:07] just about fall apart and I I I know
[1:03:10] that that living for Christ is living
[1:03:12] for others and that's not what I'm
[1:03:14] getting at I'm not opposed to that at
[1:03:17] all but maybe what real Zeal is is maybe
[1:03:21] not what we think a lot of times let's
[1:03:24] look at First Kings chap chap
[1:03:35] 17 well I'll just I'll just tell you
[1:03:38] this story for memory we don't need to
[1:03:40] read First Kings chapter 17 is where
[1:03:44] Elijah comes on the scene out of nowhere
[1:03:47] comes on the scene and he says he makes
[1:03:50] this declaration to Ahab now Ahab Israel
[1:03:54] had married to Jezebel
[1:03:56] the world system denomination just like
[1:03:59] the midianites and the moabites merged
[1:04:02] with the Israelites of that day came
[1:04:07] together and Elijah came on the scene
[1:04:10] out of
[1:04:12] nowhere Elijah was from
[1:04:15] Gilead and he made this Proclamation
[1:04:18] that he
[1:04:20] said doe no due or rain will fall on the
[1:04:23] earth until I call for for it and you
[1:04:27] know a few chapters over he
[1:04:29] said the the still Small Voice came to
[1:04:32] Elijah and said what are you doing
[1:04:34] asking him asked him what are you doing
[1:04:36] what what what is your purpose and and
[1:04:39] he said uh and I'm paraphrasing he says
[1:04:41] and Elijah answered he said I have been
[1:04:43] very jealous for the Lord God of Israel
[1:04:47] I have been very jealous now I wonder
[1:04:50] how many of us can say the same thing
[1:04:54] and what jealous he look like to Elijah
[1:04:57] right after he made that
[1:04:58] declaration he went and did exactly the
[1:05:02] opposite of what you might think he
[1:05:04] would do he went up into the mountain
[1:05:07] and sat down by a river chith and he
[1:05:10] just
[1:05:11] sat and he just
[1:05:16] waited and think about how Jesus
[1:05:21] when when they came when he was he was
[1:05:25] on a journey and they came with word
[1:05:27] that Lazarus was sick and he just
[1:05:30] continued on his way just continued
[1:05:33] doing exactly the opposite of what
[1:05:36] everyone expected he would do everyone
[1:05:39] expected he should run and and and
[1:05:42] quickly turn and my friend and you he
[1:05:45] was much loved by Jesus but he just
[1:05:48] continued on his way and you know
[1:05:50] brother brandham talked about the same
[1:05:52] thing he said everyone would come to him
[1:05:54] and say how can you leave leave your
[1:05:56] family your little children and go
[1:05:59] overseas how can you leave them but he
[1:06:02] was doing it in obedience to the will of
[1:06:04] God that's what real Zeal is doing doing
[1:06:08] living your life in obedience to the
[1:06:10] will of God what does God wants you to
[1:06:12] do and Elijah just sat
[1:06:17] there and uh and waited for God to bring
[1:06:23] his word to pass and God brought bought
[1:06:25] him food from the Ravens and fed him
[1:06:27] there and and just Elijah just rested
[1:06:31] knowing that God had everything in
[1:06:33] control and then as as the the brook
[1:06:37] chith died down it dwindled away slowly
[1:06:40] and slowly he did another thing that
[1:06:43] would seem very odd to many people he
[1:06:45] went right down to Jezebel's Homeland
[1:06:48] zidon right down in into the midst of
[1:06:52] why are you going to to where Jezebel's
[1:06:55] from R in amongst all the Gentiles and
[1:06:57] he found the little widow woman and we
[1:06:59] know that story but did exactly the
[1:07:01] opposite of what everyone was expected
[1:07:04] because he was following God he had
[1:07:06] forsaken everything he was doing what
[1:07:08] God wanted him to
[1:07:11] do and I think about what look at all
[1:07:15] these examples that have been set for us
[1:07:17] a great cloud of witness of Phineas
[1:07:20] rising up an example of what a real man
[1:07:23] is and Elijah an example of what a real
[1:07:26] man is and a real man and looking at
[1:07:28] prayer you know brother brandom said a
[1:07:30] real man doesn't have broad shoulders a
[1:07:32] real man doesn't a real man what is real
[1:07:36] Zeal a real man might be just carrying
[1:07:40] his little lunchbox to work one day but
[1:07:43] and and praying all night you know for
[1:07:45] his family I think that's what an
[1:07:47] example of what a real man is where his
[1:07:49] wife knows that he cares about the
[1:07:52] family when you come home from work and
[1:07:54] and and just the toils of Life take
[1:07:57] their toll does your family know that
[1:07:59] you care enough to get down on your
[1:08:01] knees and shake the walls praying for
[1:08:04] them praying for their salvation praying
[1:08:07] so loud not Lou get don't get me wrong
[1:08:10] but praying in such a way that your kids
[1:08:13] know that you have touched God that you
[1:08:18] have a relationship with God teach them
[1:08:21] by example right that's how I was taught
[1:08:25] BL what a what a real man he is and you
[1:08:30] can the world will maybe many times
[1:08:34] Overlook god making his word manifest in
[1:08:38] people by just the Simplicity of how he
[1:08:40] does it just a little housewife doing
[1:08:43] exactly what she's supposed to do caring
[1:08:46] for her family and maybe like brother
[1:08:48] Brand's wife praying over every little
[1:08:50] garment that came across her iron board
[1:08:53] that's doing exactly what God wants her
[1:08:55] to do do so you don't have to run to and
[1:08:58] fro to be pleasing to God but just men
[1:09:00] carry a little lunchbox to work and be
[1:09:02] an example and sisters be an example to
[1:09:05] your family example of what a real
[1:09:07] mother and a real wife should be a real
[1:09:10] man a real sister and daughter of God
[1:09:14] that's what I'm talking
[1:09:17] about real Zeal for the Lord real Zeal
[1:09:21] comes when you catch the vision glory
[1:09:25] and and I'll just finish with
[1:09:28] this about how there was another man in
[1:09:31] the Bible that lost his
[1:09:33] vision and that was
[1:09:36] Samson and God gave his parents a vision
[1:09:39] that this man will begin to drive out
[1:09:41] the Philistines and he had a vision of
[1:09:44] what he was supposed to do and what he
[1:09:46] was raised up for and he lived that
[1:09:48] Vision out until one day a little woman
[1:09:51] named ailah took away his vision called
[1:09:55] and cut his hair he you know he lost
[1:09:57] that Vision before she cut his hair away
[1:10:00] but
[1:10:01] um because he lost the sight of what he
[1:10:04] was really raised up for but one day
[1:10:10] he
[1:10:12] maybe maybe if you think that you're
[1:10:14] forsaken that God has forsaken you like
[1:10:17] maybe Samson thought that God had
[1:10:20] forgotten about you but Samson caught
[1:10:23] sight when when they when they it's very
[1:10:27] striking to me that when they punched
[1:10:28] his eyes out is the very time in his
[1:10:32] life when he really began to catch the
[1:10:34] vision to catch the vision that it might
[1:10:36] be possible to return back to God to
[1:10:39] return back into fellowship with him
[1:10:41] that that power that he had felt before
[1:10:44] might return back to him but the thing
[1:10:46] about Samson is to get back into a
[1:10:49] relationship with God he was going to
[1:10:51] have to lose it all he was going to have
[1:10:53] to give up everything right he was going
[1:10:54] to have to give his life up and that's
[1:10:57] how we
[1:10:58] are to
[1:11:00] come for that power of God to fall upon
[1:11:03] you you've got to give up everything
[1:11:05] you've got to die and so Samson was
[1:11:08] willing to die to get the power of God
[1:11:10] back in his life he was willing to die
[1:11:13] to get that Zeal
[1:11:15] back let me just read a few quotes as
[1:11:19] the musicians come forward a few quotes
[1:11:21] that just once more Lord
[1:11:23] 1963 December the first brother brandham
[1:11:27] said and Samson was blind but here is
[1:11:30] what Samson recognized that the church
[1:11:32] has never come to yet he knew there was
[1:11:34] a possibility of coming back again if
[1:11:37] the church could only know that a
[1:11:39] possibility but the people of today
[1:11:41] don't seem to catch the vision yet they
[1:11:43] don't seem to catch it that there is a
[1:11:46] possibility it doesn't come through you
[1:11:48] can shout a little more patch your hands
[1:11:50] a little more or dance a little more
[1:11:52] that isn't it no it's back to the word
[1:11:54] there is a possibility of coming back
[1:11:56] and getting the word on the inside again
[1:11:59] you bypassed it there notice they sit
[1:12:01] tight but you see that's all sales
[1:12:04] without any anchor there's a possibility
[1:12:07] to get Zeal glory and I believe that to
[1:12:10] to get Zeal back in your life you've got
[1:12:12] to give it all thank you I'll turn it
[1:12:15] over to brother Dale
[1:12:29] I believe we're in the end time where it
[1:12:31] can be let's Stand Together really
[1:12:33] enjoyed the message make sure you tell
[1:12:34] our brother we appreciate it amen I
[1:12:37] believe it I believe in setting a a goal
[1:12:40] in your life and try to achieve to it
[1:12:42] that's right ain't trying to set
[1:12:44] something by a book of rules or whatever
[1:12:47] but there's a possibility in this
[1:12:49] day that this bride of Jesus
[1:12:52] Christ will walk off the earth amen Amen
[1:12:55] in a change he won't have to die that's
[1:12:58] promised in God's word so then I believe
[1:13:01] that
[1:13:01] promise I want to hold on to that and no
[1:13:05] matter
[1:13:07] what let me keep that right what do we
[1:13:09] got brother number 77 in power 77 in
[1:13:13] power anybody have a need the alar is
[1:13:14] open
[1:13:30] you have a need we've heard a great
[1:13:32] message
[1:13:36] now seeing that there is an
[1:13:43] opportunity we can be what God wants us
[1:13:45] to
[1:13:47] be and each one of those that he spoke
[1:13:49] of took it in their
[1:13:52] heart said that's it
[1:14:04] Jesus
[1:14:14] wonderful
[1:14:19] Will in the
[1:14:21] light of his glory
[1:14:29] PR turn your
[1:14:43] eyes all you got to do is just
[1:14:48] believe step out on what you believe and
[1:14:50] just say thank you Lord
[1:14:55] and see where it works or
[1:14:58] not expect a
[1:15:01] miracle why not we serve a miracle
[1:15:04] working
[1:15:05] God yeah but it's just not my case well
[1:15:09] what case could be too hard for
[1:15:16] God
[1:15:22] his and the
[1:15:32] in the
[1:15:33] life of his
[1:15:36] glory
[1:15:42] and see I don't believe God died when
[1:15:44] the prophet passed off the
[1:15:47] scene I believe the same God that walks
[1:15:50] the shores of
[1:15:52] Galilee is right here today
[1:15:56] to give you what you
[1:15:58] desire but you got to believe
[1:16:02] it but it's not far you if you don't
[1:16:05] believe
[1:16:07] it then what is it do we need do we need
[1:16:10] a new
[1:16:11] birth promised in his
[1:16:14] word do we need healing promised in his
[1:16:21] word we need peace in our soul he
[1:16:24] promised in his word
[1:16:28] but we got to step out on
[1:16:33] it and Ain something that we just lay
[1:16:35] back and have hazardously receive we got
[1:16:38] to believe
[1:16:41] it in
[1:16:44] the anybody else who want to
[1:16:52] come your
[1:17:09] and
[1:17:12] the
[1:17:16] will in

[1:17:21] glory and grace
[1:17:27] turn your you have a need
[1:17:33] come come let's
[1:17:48] see it won't be
[1:17:52] important you look at it now around the
[1:17:54] world how everything's falling
[1:17:58] apart where once you had a goal and a
[1:18:01] strive to build and have nice homes
[1:18:06] and make money and things what is it
[1:18:15] now what is it
[1:18:20] now one day is all it takes one moment
[1:18:25] and all can be
[1:18:29] changed but you know what we serve an
[1:18:32] eternal God that made a lot of promises
[1:18:34] when the enemy comes
[1:18:36] in he said he'd raise up a
[1:18:40] standard so when you look around you see
[1:18:42] everything falling apart that's the time
[1:18:44] to
[1:18:45] realize God is
[1:18:49] here he's here to take over and going to
[1:18:52] take his little bride through
[1:18:56] so it's not a horrible
[1:18:59] time wonderful
