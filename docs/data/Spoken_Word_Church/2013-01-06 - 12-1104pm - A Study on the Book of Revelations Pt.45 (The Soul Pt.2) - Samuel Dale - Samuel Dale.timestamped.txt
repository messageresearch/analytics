[29:17] amen
[29:20] Revelations
[29:22] one the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[29:25] God gave unto him to sh unto his servant
[29:27] things which must shortly come to pass
[29:30] and he sent and signified it by his
[29:32] Angel unto his servant
[29:34] John who by record of the word of God
[29:37] and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[29:38] all things that he saw this it is he
[29:41] that readeth and they that hear the
[29:43] words of this prophecy now remember
[29:45] that's what it is isn't it am the Bible
[29:48] is a prophecy until it's fulfill right
[29:52] amen right all right there was a day you
[29:57] were
[29:58] lost a prophecy in the Bible said if
[30:01] you'd believe you'd be saved but the day
[30:04] you received it and it become a reality
[30:06] it was no longer a prophecy so we're in
[30:09] the end time of winding down of all the
[30:11] word so this is not just right the
[30:14] prophecy modern events made
[30:18] clear amen by the revealed word around
[30:21] us right blessed is he that read us and
[30:24] they that hear the words of this
[30:25] prophecy and keep those things which are
[30:27] written they in for the time is at hand
[30:30] what time time to
[30:32] understand right chapter
[30:36] 6:9 and when he had opened the fifth
[30:38] seal I saw under the altar The Souls of
[30:40] them remember what we were saying this
[30:42] morning not bodies not Spirits
[30:46] Souls of them that were slain their
[30:50] bodies were down in the
[30:51] grave for the word of God and for the
[30:54] testimony which they held and they cried
[30:56] with a loud voice saying how long oh
[30:58] Lord holy and true does thou not judge
[31:02] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[31:04] on the earth so that is not the bride of
[31:06] Christ she does not cry for Revenge she
[31:09] cries for forgiveness all right and
[31:12] white robes were given unto every one of
[31:15] them and it was said unto them that they
[31:17] should rest yet for a little season
[31:20] until their fellow servants also and
[31:22] their Brethren which should be killed as
[31:25] they were should be fulfilled field you
[31:27] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[31:30] to the reading of the word now we got up
[31:34] so far this morning in a a thought and I
[31:37] guess we'll call it part two
[31:41] because we been studying on the Book of
[31:45] Revelations I think this makes message
[31:47] number
[31:48] 45 we just put a s TI to it this morning
[31:52] for the viewers out for them to follow
[31:54] with us of the Soul
[31:58] because we read here in
[32:01] Revelation that it said The Souls of
[32:04] them right that were slain right for the
[32:08] word of God and for the testimony they
[32:11] held it's not bodies up there is Souls
[32:16] right but how real is a soul amen right
[32:19] what is a soul that was what our point
[32:22] was the soul is the real you amen that's
[32:26] right you think your body is real but
[32:29] your body can go to the grave and rotten
[32:33] out but that soul will never die until
[32:37] even as a sinner it has to be destroyed
[32:41] in the Lake of Fire after the white
[32:43] Throne
[32:44] judgment don't know what we read this
[32:46] morning don't fear a person that can
[32:49] kill the
[32:50] body but fear the one that can destroy
[32:54] the soul that's right and the body
[32:58] in
[33:00] hell right so then the Soul is the real
[33:03] you that's the part that God is dealing
[33:08] with trying to get us to a place to
[33:13] understand the real person so let's
[33:16] remember that also
[33:18] uh with this Bible in the case has been
[33:21] up here for a couple of years or
[33:24] something I guess laying here in a
[33:26] church they know nothing minut
[33:28] it is it anybody say
[33:36] here soone said well I don't know what
[33:38] to do with it just keep laying around
[33:41] but Jim B said he'd like to have it amen
[33:44] so all right so every who did belong to
[33:49] don't belong to no
[33:51] more we're going to give it to Tim Mo
[33:54] today as a wedding present
[34:02] remember that's what we to do we get
[34:04] somebody a Bible well that's where you
[34:06] need to start your
[34:08] marriage and if you're fussing like
[34:10] everything go both of you and just take
[34:12] the Bible and hold it yeah and it'll
[34:15] solve a lot of
[34:16] problems right so we we'll give that to
[34:19] Timbo as a wedding
[34:21] present and it's to be used
[34:25] now
[34:27] hard not just laid
[34:30] up all right okay but
[34:34] anyhow so we got into the point this
[34:37] morning of talking
[34:39] about that the prophet of God said the
[34:42] fifth seal showed a lot of things
[34:45] absolutely
[34:46] amen and he said one thing it disproved
[34:50] Soul
[34:52] sleeping and we went through that part
[34:54] that that it showed then
[34:58] that people think see when you die
[35:00] you're just
[35:02] gone you know have you ever heard
[35:04] anybody I'm honest now I'm not talking
[35:07] about in the message I'm talking about
[35:10] before you came in the message is you
[35:12] ever hear anybody that was really
[35:15] explaining Body Spirit and soul or
[35:18] whatever no because it was afraid of it
[35:21] they didn't know what to do right they
[35:23] didn't know how to put it
[35:25] together
[35:27] but see the soul is the real you
[35:30] amen we gave that scripture this morning
[35:33] the soul that
[35:34] sinth and shall
[35:37] die Ezekiel 18:4 said All Souls are mine
[35:42] right right so he created Every
[35:47] Soul that's ever been in the world Amen
[35:50] whether you're saved lost Whatever It Is
[35:55] God had to create that that's right all
[35:57] right we read in
[35:59] Genesis that it said God breathed into
[36:02] the nostrils of
[36:04] Adam and he became a living
[36:09] Soul all right amen a living
[36:14] Soul

[36:37] for rain right rain because what it's
[36:40] it's raining okay not much okay praise
[36:43] the Lord the Lord because I mean I just
[36:45] lay down at night it's not just while
[36:48] I'm preaching I just lay down at night
[36:50] and it just dries up and it starts
[36:53] tightening up you know not that way just
[36:56] just I got to
[36:58] cough all right but we'll cough and
[37:01] preach so maybe my coughing be right my
[37:04] preaching might be wrong but we'll try
[37:06] to do the best we can then you just have
[37:08] to read
[37:09] MOS you remember what we talking about
[37:11] this morning they had that elephant now
[37:12] that could speak so you know listen to
[37:15] my call All right but now listen
[37:19] Church the serious
[37:22] matter of what or not what you are right
[37:27] to understand you say well do we need to
[37:30] understand well do we need water baptism
[37:33] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:37] Christ do we need the teaching of one
[37:40] God
[37:41] right do we need anything in the Bible
[37:44] amen so if we need one thing of it we
[37:47] need all of
[37:49] it and see to find out who you are the
[37:52] prophet of God said when the bride
[37:53] realizes who she is that's right
[37:57] and what she's doing here right M he
[38:01] said well let just realize and I'm
[38:03] bride right well it's like I told you

[38:13] to baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[38:15] something like that it just all
[38:17] confusing you know don't know where I'm
[38:20] bride or not but I got the new birth
[38:22] well if you got the new birth you got to
[38:24] be Bri amen right yes sir right amen see
[38:28] and to realize who we
[38:29] are and what part you are
[38:34] right come on don't you even never
[38:39] consider um even as I've tried to
[38:42] explain to you
[38:43] before
[38:47] dreams did you have a bad
[38:51] dream don't you ever consider what that
[38:53] Parts is doing that of your body righten
[38:57] and then you know in you and then uh
[39:01] something comes up and you you have a
[39:04] just stand talk you have a wrong thought
[39:06] come in your mind I I never was a person
[39:09] I I didn't I never did have a vulgar
[39:12] mouth as a sinner I didn't I never I
[39:16] never drank cuz I didn't want to and I
[39:18] didn't have a vulgar
[39:20] mouth well you know after I got
[39:23] saved I'd be talking to somebody
[39:27] and before I know that I had to stop to
[39:29] keep from saying a dirty
[39:33] word boy you are messed up I agree with
[39:35] you I think you are too amen so we're
[39:38] all in good shape we're all messed
[39:41] up but you don't nothing like that don't
[39:43] ever
[39:44] happen and I never drank never cared for
[39:46] it then see somebody take a drink and
[39:48] you
[39:50] said you know mouth Waters a little bit
[39:53] you got to
[39:55] swallow oh
[39:58] you're not you ain't never do nothing
[39:59] like that I me you you you don't have no
[40:02] wrong
[40:03] thoughts I mean everything's perfect and
[40:05] wonderful you know you don't never think
[40:09] wrong well what is the part of you
[40:11] that's doing that thinking
[40:14] that
[40:16] right why is it the prophet would
[40:20] say it's not wrong the thoughts you
[40:24] think but if you entertain those have
[40:27] become part of
[40:30] you Satan could tempt
[40:33] Jesus said now you can argue with him he
[40:36] said even with women sure now that don't
[40:40] go into all that garbage can talking
[40:42] about this morning where they talking
[40:43] about how wrong Jesus is and and he
[40:47] sinned no right sin is unbelief amen he
[40:52] was a human mortal y subject to that he
[40:55] had to eat eat he had to drink he had to
[40:58] live he had to sleep right right amen
[41:00] that's right right but why would he
[41:03] speak of the inward part of man as the
[41:07] soul why would David as we'll get to it
[41:09] a little bit cry out my soul thirst us
[41:13] after thee oh
[41:15] God why in the Old Testament was they a
[41:18] actually an offering had to be
[41:21] given in The Ransom of a soul
[41:25] right
[41:28] and see then we would say well the soul
[41:30] brother Dale is just the nature of the
[41:32] spirit that's incorrect show me a quote
[41:34] anywhere of brother around right he says
[41:37] the soul is the nature of the spirit
[41:39] when you say it's just the nature of the
[41:41] spirit you're just making it all just
[41:43] like a dog a cat of nature Y and you can
[41:46] be Anointed with a genuine Holy Spirit
[41:50] on your
[41:51] spirit every day of your life the
[41:53] prophet had and die and go to hell right
[41:56] so there's got to be more to the New
[41:57] Birth than just a a spirit coming living
[42:01] in me right
[42:04] yeah it's got to be the person amen
[42:07] right amen so we're talking about the
[42:10] person of God amen amen trying to relate
[42:13] back then as to seeing the
[42:16] soul as I said then there we we covered
[42:19] it this morning that it does away with
[42:21] soul sleeping right well if it does away
[42:24] with soul sleeping then the FI seal
[42:25] would be revealing what the soul really
[42:27] is right and how it is not there
[42:31] something gone when you die that it
[42:34] lives on
[42:37] somewhere see because it talks of these
[42:40] people here yes after they're killed on
[42:43] Earth they have a place we covered that
[42:45] this morning they have a Redemptive
[42:49] form that Israel is crying daily for his
[42:55] people
[42:57] they have a Redemptive form the name of
[42:59] Israel amen sure and they're given white
[43:02] robes yes not that they're worthy of
[43:06] them not that they ask for them
[43:11] right but because God blinded those
[43:14] people right
[43:16] Amen to where you and I could be saved
[43:19] right amen if he had blinded them they
[43:22] would have accepted and you and I
[43:24] wouldn't have salvation that's right
[43:26] but he knew we would want it he was
[43:28] gracious enough that's right but see the
[43:32] soul is
[43:35] real we read there the quotes from The
[43:37] Prophet where that those beyond the
[43:40] curtain I mean those under the Altar and
[43:42] he would call it the souls of the fifth
[43:44] seal Jew he said they have memory reason
[43:47] they have feelings they
[43:49] have well because they can talk they can
[43:51] reason right right so you're not just
[43:55] dead right right amen you live on
[43:58] somewhere
[44:01] amen only God can kill that Soul or
[44:04] annihilated to where it would come into
[44:06] nonexistence and that can't be done
[44:08] until the watch thr judgment that's
[44:10] right you for a sinner so no we're not
[44:13] even trying to make a Christian we've
[44:14] tried to cover the point that every
[44:17] every person in the
[44:19] world come from God right Satan can't
[44:23] give you a soul see that's what the
[44:26] trouble was with the two Soul they say
[44:28] God gave you a soul and Satan gave you a
[44:32] soul that's why they called it two Souls
[44:35] see and said what it is that you need to
[44:39] just destroy that old soul of Satan and
[44:42] said you don't need none that's cuz he
[44:44] always was
[44:46] eternal that's the doctrine that's a two
[44:48] Soul
[44:51] Doctrine well then how much if we
[44:53] thought about it and consider those
[44:56] thoughts in our
[45:02] mind but what about it folks what are we
[45:08] yes we're a higher form of animal yes
[45:12] yes but we ended up talking about that
[45:16] see the animal has a nature to it right
[45:19] he has a spirit part of
[45:22] him but he doesn't have a
[45:24] soul
[45:30] because that would have to be in the
[45:32] image of
[45:33] God because that's what he done in
[45:36] Genesis and your Prophet says even a
[45:40] sinner you want these
[45:42] quotes even a
[45:44] sinner he would call a sinner that his
[45:47] soul was he would call it
[45:50] Immortal you said but Immortal means
[45:53] Eternal but it evidently didn't to him
[45:55] right
[45:57] mhm he would use the words like that for
[46:00] even a
[46:02] sinner
[46:04] right you see folks we need a new birth
[46:07] right and the new birth is not in your
[46:10] body that's right it is not a spirit
[46:12] coming in your
[46:14] spirit it is the very person of God to
[46:17] come and live in your soul amen
[46:20] amen we then it be a soul right we'll
[46:24] get down to that in a little bit where
[46:26] the prophet of God said he sent back his
[46:27] soul on the day of Pentecost in the form
[46:30] of the baptism of the Holy
[46:32] Ghost I hope I brought the one where he
[46:35] says he said that Spirit he said that's
[46:37] the spirit of God he said but I'm
[46:39] talking about the
[46:41] soul that was given in our
[46:45] place that's right the real you yeah
[46:49] right what makes
[46:53] us religious and go to church and
[46:55] anointing on our spirit
[46:58] right and you even love God with your
[47:03] spirit but that soul is the real
[47:06] you right and that's what God is dealing
[47:10] with we'll get down to the quotes in a
[47:11] minute so we just try to start off here
[47:13] where we left off this morning on the
[47:16] prophet was
[47:20] saying let's go ahead with number 11 if
[47:22] we get the wrong numbers on these out
[47:24] while you forgive us cuz I had to put
[47:25] the more morning together with the
[47:26] evening instead of preaching the morning
[47:28] back over and then preaching the evening
[47:31] we try to get it in one okay here's
[47:34] where we kind of ended up
[47:36] talking this is the message called Faith
[47:39] 1961 813 paragraph
[47:42] 7 now the soul is that part of you who
[47:45] knows and
[47:48] understands your
[47:50] intelligence that's the difference you
[47:52] and the dog right the dog has a
[47:55] intelligence form about him but he has
[47:58] no soul to make him different the bird
[48:01] still builds its nest the same as it did
[48:04] 6,000 years
[48:06] ago it has its own intelligence it's own
[48:09] do it but not the intelligence of a
[48:11] human
[48:14] right all
[48:16] right now watch where he Gres right
[48:18] straight to your intelligence you
[48:21] remember the dision I had not long ago
[48:24] so that was beyond the curtain of
[48:27] and we'll give them if we don't we have
[48:29] them for Wednesday brother R said the
[48:31] angel of the Lord referred to that is
[48:33] sold under the
[48:34] altar right when he was beond the C
[48:40] time it's not to Fe sealed you no uh
[48:44] it's a bride you remember the vision I
[48:47] had L long ago a little translation went
[48:48] into that place and saw those people now
[48:51] your spirit will come back to that
[48:54] body and that that kind of a body you'll
[48:57] see after a while when we get down to
[48:59] the theophany why it's called a body
[49:02] sure all
[49:04] right that kind of a body the soul which
[49:07] is a body that does not have to eat and
[49:09] so forth if this Earth the Tabernacle be
[49:11] dissolve we have one already waiting a
[49:13] Celestial body and with that spirit and
[49:17] that soul and Celestial body putting you
[49:20] back
[49:21] together you'll raise up again this
[49:24] natural body for that great Millennium
[49:27] amen
[49:29] now see then now we're getting the
[49:33] understanding of what will even take
[49:35] place in the resurrection and change and
[49:39] things but remember it's coming from
[49:41] what our thoughts were on the fifth seal
[49:45] that it removes Soul sleeping right am
[49:49] cuz they're not asleep right right
[49:52] they're alive and well doing they're
[49:55] real
[49:57] the bride is not a soul sleeping form
[50:00] right brother R seen them felt them talk
[50:03] to
[50:04] them just beyond the curtain of time
[50:10] right so now watch as we try to move on
[50:13] a little
[50:14] bit go go ahead to number
[50:20] eight let me excuse me number 12 I'll
[50:23] get it right a minute I look back to
[50:25] this place got wrong one all right
[50:28] paragraph 443 444 or 445 on up to
[50:32] 450 of the filth seal the fith seal has
[50:36] opened CC many other
[50:39] things open their C any other things
[50:43] have you C
[50:44] it yeah it was more than just learning
[50:47] of a right right of people that would be
[50:51] the the Israel of God what I've asked
[50:55] you to read the book sit down and just
[50:58] read that book and read the seal book
[51:00] and then just read it over again and see
[51:03] what it's talking to you not what it's
[51:05] talking about somebody
[51:07] else right but what is it talking to you
[51:11] yes all I'm waiting for questions
[51:14] here now where was the ark the slain the
[51:17] wound and bleeding blood for atonement
[51:19] are these oldest PR notice the Bible
[51:21] says if deser the Tabernacle of our
[51:23] dwelling be disolved we have one already
[51:26] waiting that's where I seen those Saints
[51:30] now he goes from the fifth seal in one
[51:32] paragraph see the still people right
[51:34] down into the Saints and showing it's
[51:36] showing you the same
[51:39] right it's showing you those people
[51:41] that's real
[51:45] right right they're not up there Earth
[51:48] we used to think you know playing on
[51:50] Hearts you
[51:54] know he said they're real right right
[51:58] these musicians have it on us all in
[52:00] them Hearts he
[52:04] explains a woman having a baby and her
[52:07] desires and how she becomes kind and
[52:10] sweet and all right before the baby come
[52:14] why but did you notice around that
[52:17] mother seems to be a sweet
[52:20] feeling what is
[52:24] it
[52:25] it's a little spiritual body
[52:28] Y come
[52:30] on spiritual life is waiting to come
[52:33] into that little body as soon as it's
[52:37] born now see before it's born what it's
[52:40] only begotten right but when it's born
[52:43] it's born the spiritual body unites with
[52:46] the natural body right and that
[52:49] something you think the doctors can
[52:50] explain to you yeah you go into your
[52:53] doctor next time you get there and say
[52:54] doct I want you to explain to me the
[52:55] difference in Body Spirit and soul he
[52:58] said I'll explain it to you we bring a
[52:59] straight jacket in here in a
[53:02] minute we'll let them guys that know it
[53:04] all about it talk to you you know what
[53:07] I'm saying is true that's
[53:11] right so then around the mother is a
[53:14] sweet little
[53:18] presence
[53:21] why now I remember Joy though
[53:26] telling Danny to get out of the
[53:28] room cuz she was
[53:30] hurt that does nothing mean sisters that
[53:33] just caus you lay there hurting that
[53:35] that sweet's presence wouldn't there
[53:37] right it was
[53:39] there
[53:42] right come on your Prophet said it
[53:46] was so if you're mad at a hornet they
[53:49] still there right cuz he didn't explain
[53:53] that was only Christian women so then a
[53:56] woman of the world is going to be
[53:57] screaming and cussing and raising can
[53:59] that still don't change the thing but
[54:02] that sweet little presence what is it
[54:05] that soul is fixing to come into that
[54:07] body
[54:09] right right cuz all souls are mine
[54:12] remember God created the soul Satan
[54:14] can't do it right right right so then
[54:17] what does he say and the Bible teaches
[54:20] that we are now begotten of God right
[54:24] we're begotten of the Holy spirit that
[54:25] is in that spirit that in US is Christ
[54:30] yes now he's caring you all the way to
[54:32] adoptions and that a Son of God being
[54:35] formed in
[54:36] us and when this Earthly body be
[54:39] dissolved this spiritual body comes from
[54:42] the bows of the earth there spiritual
[54:44] body that
[54:46] come comes from the bows of the earth
[54:49] there is another body waiting to receive
[54:52] it so he's explaining what you are from
[54:53] the natural you are Spirit spiritual
[54:55] condition that come from the vowels of
[54:56] the earth life all right but there's
[54:59] another body waiting to receive it if
[55:02] this Earthly Tabernacle is dropped there
[55:04] is another body to receive it this
[55:06] Mortal body puts on
[55:09] immortality this
[55:11] terrestrial puts on Celestial Paul
[55:13] explains it in the scripture that there
[55:15] are different bodies of things and he
[55:17] says there is a celestrial body and
[55:20] there's a terrestrial body right see the
[55:22] celestial body is a Heavenly terrestrial
[55:24] is a natural all
[55:26] right this Mortal puts on immortality
[55:29] this terrestrial puts on puts on cestal
[55:33] see see what I mean there is a natural
[55:36] body that's sinful but in its making
[55:39] just like it is another body that we go
[55:43] to and I am so grateful to God that I
[55:46] can say as your pastor and brother I've
[55:49] seen those people what about that
[55:52] pleasure then so help me in that body
[55:55] and handle them with my hands that's
[55:58] right right now what kind of a body is
[56:00] he speaking
[56:03] of he's just explaining the fifth seal
[56:06] this is just right down under the point
[56:09] where he was explaining that Soul
[56:11] sleeping is
[56:14] wrong now he's explaining the group of
[56:16] his people that he
[56:18] sees what and he calls them Souls under
[56:21] the
[56:22] altar M he not talking about your body
[56:25] there being beyond the curtain of time
[56:27] it's not your spirit it's your soul amen
[56:31] right he explains if you die your body
[56:33] goes to the Grave your spirit goes back
[56:35] to God who gave it but said your soul
[56:37] goes under the altar we'll read in a
[56:39] minute that even when Jesus went to hell
[56:42] it was his soul that went to hell
[56:45] amen that's
[56:47] right his theop the prophet
[56:51] says
[56:53] now we know that the story continues on
[56:57] for us
[56:59] here but to those on the internet I'm
[57:02] trying to make it hard to the newer
[57:05] ones a lot of you know where I'll be
[57:07] going to with
[57:09] it that your soul is your theophany
[57:13] right you know that God I've been
[57:15] teaching that for 40
[57:17] years but to those who haven't heard the
[57:19] story I'm trying to approach it from a
[57:21] way that you'll see the soul of Jesus
[57:24] Christ
[57:26] amen and that these so under the altar
[57:29] that he
[57:30] saw are real and that that F seal you is
[57:34] the real people the soul and that's what
[57:37] you are you're not just a glob you're
[57:40] not just a you know
[57:43] right brother R said it was beautiful
[57:45] women all about 18 year 20 years old
[57:50] Y and uh you going to have to argue with
[57:53] him he said men
[57:57] with shoulder L shoulder
[58:01] L right but we don't have it here cuz we
[58:04] teach against it right now right but
[58:07] when we get there it will be no
[58:12] problem you'll be able to tell the
[58:14] difference between the men and the
[58:19] women now
[58:22] listen so what is it
[58:29] I seen those people he
[58:33] said and he seen them as real people yep
[58:36] that's
[58:39] right yet your body's in the grave your
[58:41] spirit is going back to
[58:46] God now look at the next one Christ is
[58:49] revealed in his own word 12
[58:52] a and the main point I want want you to
[58:55] get out of that is coming on down here
[58:56] to the bottom because you can read all
[58:57] of it you got eternal life and it's the
[58:59] only life there is in Heavenly places
[59:02] recognize it he's in you in he was in
[59:05] him in gene form but come on down to the
[59:08] the Life part that's what I want you to
[59:10] see uh you can be anointed out here in
[59:14] this spirit and desire and do all these
[59:16] other things but when it comes to the ti
[59:19] poost of that word you'll never move
[59:21] from there you'll whole right steady and
[59:23] true to God
[59:25] as it can be outside of that regardless
[59:27] of what you do you're
[59:30] lost you're lost if you don't value that
[59:33] word right you said I don't care what
[59:36] you
[59:37] do because the word see is the only
[59:40] thing that's going to tell
[59:41] you what you are
[59:45] right you can be anointed let's see this
[59:48] in this
[59:49] message paragraph
[59:53] 29
[59:56] you can be anointed on your spirit
[59:58] that's right but that is not your soul
[1:00:01] that's being dealt with right amen if I
[1:00:05] had time I did years ago and took it
[1:00:06] down
[1:00:10] through I believe that when
[1:00:13] you're repent of your sins and you come
[1:00:15] to justification that's the work of the
[1:00:17] Holy Spirit I believe that that's right
[1:00:19] I believe that's what the prophet taught
[1:00:22] and that anointing of God will come into
[1:00:24] your presence and be there with
[1:00:27] you because it says that the goodness of
[1:00:30] God leadth the to repentance amen then
[1:00:33] when you come to
[1:00:35] sanctification see there's the danger
[1:00:37] cuz when you come to sanctification you
[1:00:39] get all cleansed out and set aside and
[1:00:41] that anointing can come to you to your
[1:00:44] spirit and anoint you to do great
[1:00:47] things and you wind up to be anointed
[1:00:50] ones but the soul still be lost right
[1:00:54] right
[1:00:55] it's got to go back to the word you see
[1:00:57] what he goes on down
[1:00:59] here and let's see who he
[1:01:01] is that lady you're in church a naked
[1:01:04] blind miserable and don't even know it
[1:01:06] see anointed Anointed with the real
[1:01:08] Spirit see that Holy Spirit can fall
[1:01:10] upon a man in his
[1:01:13] Spirit
[1:01:15] y so the new birth is not just a spirit
[1:01:18] coming down upon you no that's right
[1:01:22] there it's the soul of God coming to
[1:01:24] live in you which is a person said but
[1:01:27] his soul is his
[1:01:30] germ the Holy Spirit can fall upon a man
[1:01:33] in his Spirit but his soul is his germ
[1:01:35] that germ is the word right now if we
[1:01:38] ain't never the word we we're in bad
[1:01:40] shape I don't care how much you can
[1:01:41] preach how well you can do this how much
[1:01:43] you love that's one of the inlets to the
[1:01:46] spirit you can't love without with your
[1:01:49] body y you love with your spirit that's
[1:01:52] one of the Endless and you you can love
[1:01:55] and even love God and still not be right
[1:01:58] you can cast out devils and preach and
[1:02:01] do these things still not be right Jesus
[1:02:04] said so said many would come in that day
[1:02:08] he said that settles it all right
[1:02:15] now look what we
[1:02:18] are so listen let him ask the
[1:02:21] question look at the next one number 13
[1:02:27] from the message the word became flesh
[1:02:28] and India trip report paragraph 188 1954
[1:02:33] 10:03 the morning
[1:02:35] service we are a three-fold being soul
[1:02:38] body Spirit we know that what this flesh
[1:02:43] is we realize that it's here we know
[1:02:47] what the spirit is it controls the flesh
[1:02:50] but what is the
[1:02:53] soul but what is the
[1:02:56] soul the
[1:02:58] nature of the spirit see that's 54 now
[1:03:03] he'll say the same thing in 63 in just a
[1:03:07] moment when a man is
[1:03:09] converted it doesn't mean that here is a
[1:03:13] good deep teaching I hope you'll get it
[1:03:15] someday I'm going to tell you some boys
[1:03:17] another day he goes on down to explain
[1:03:19] what the new birth is but I'm W to get
[1:03:23] to us to see what the soul is look at 14
[1:03:27] the psalmist David said my soul thirst
[1:03:30] is for thee are the Living
[1:03:34] God When shall I come and appear before
[1:03:37] God David
[1:03:40] knew he said Thy word y have I hid in my
[1:03:45] heart soul being heart is a word for
[1:03:49] soul
[1:03:51] right that's why it said out of the
[1:03:53] heart proceedeth all
[1:03:54] things out of the Soul not a thumping
[1:03:58] gizard or the
[1:04:00] heart it's your soul you're being it's
[1:04:03] what you are that's why the scripture
[1:04:05] covers
[1:04:07] it look at the next one I want to read a
[1:04:10] lot of these this afternoon to get out
[1:04:12] of the
[1:04:13] way E15 of the thirsting for life
[1:04:18] 58601 you know my soul thirst for thee
[1:04:21] if your soul is what if your soul is
[1:04:25] what directs you it's what makes you
[1:04:28] what you
[1:04:31] are a conversion is a soul is the nature
[1:04:36] of the spirit and when a man is
[1:04:38] converted he doesn't get another Spirit
[1:04:42] watch
[1:04:43] it he gets a spirit
[1:04:48] change now that's exactly
[1:04:50] scriptural give you a new heart and a
[1:04:52] new spirit right that's that's not the
[1:04:54] Holy Spirit right come on you give a new
[1:04:58] heart a new spirit then he said I put my
[1:05:00] spirit within you all right right he
[1:05:02] doesn't get another Spirit he gets he
[1:05:04] gets a spirit change and a conversion
[1:05:06] means to change his thinking change his
[1:05:09] way of living and so forth so my soul
[1:05:11] thirst for
[1:05:15] thee your soul is what makes The Thirst
[1:05:19] right cuz that's the real part of
[1:05:21] you that Spirit can be anointed you
[1:05:24] shout and have a good time do all kind
[1:05:25] of things but down inside of there you
[1:05:27] know there something
[1:05:31] wrong thirsting for God what about it
[1:05:34] look at the next
[1:05:37] one the everpresent water from the
[1:05:40] rock Jesus was when he was here on Earth
[1:05:44] when he
[1:05:45] died his soul descended into
[1:05:49] hell now show me one scripture where it
[1:05:51] says he Spirit or the prophet say it's
[1:05:54] his soul that went to hell he preached
[1:05:57] to the spirits that were in prison the
[1:05:59] souls in prison they repented not the
[1:06:01] Longs suffering of the days of Noah his
[1:06:04] body went into the grave but before he
[1:06:07] died he commended his Spirit into the
[1:06:09] hands of God his Spirit went to God his
[1:06:12] soul went to hell and his body went to
[1:06:14] grave to the grave and Jesus was B out
[1:06:17] from Resurrection because the scripture
[1:06:18] said he three things until the scripture
[1:06:21] could be fulfilled he could not come
[1:06:23] back because he had to St in the grave
[1:06:24] for three days and nights but when the
[1:06:26] spirit was all fulfilled this bar was
[1:06:29] taken away his Spirit descended to his
[1:06:31] soul and his soul to his body and he
[1:06:34] rose
[1:06:35] again how much more
[1:06:38] simpler could it ever
[1:06:41] be right go ahead with the next one
[1:06:43] which is Exodus 30
[1:06:45] and2 and th take us the sum of the
[1:06:48] children of Israel after their manner
[1:06:50] then shall they give Every Man a ransom
[1:06:53] for his Soul unto the Lord
[1:06:57] yep everybody was taken numbered and
[1:07:01] then they gave a
[1:07:03] ransom that didn't save them that was a
[1:07:06] commandment right right to bring him you
[1:07:10] know to that point all right look at
[1:07:15] John Jesus said now is my soul
[1:07:19] troubled what shall I say father save me
[1:07:23] from this hour but
[1:07:24] this CA came un to this hour now is my
[1:07:27] soul
[1:07:29] troubled he knew he was going to
[1:07:35] die now it's like I've always
[1:07:39] said you can shout all you want
[1:07:42] to I'm 1,00% in favor of
[1:07:46] shouting I do my own in my own ways a
[1:07:50] lot of times down in the woods listening
[1:07:53] to a table
[1:07:56] but now
[1:07:58] listen you can shout all you want to but
[1:08:01] when they pull that gun out and stick it
[1:08:03] to that
[1:08:06] head you're going to find out real quick
[1:08:09] whether that person is in the spirit of
[1:08:11] God or is it just them that's right
[1:08:15] right
[1:08:16] amen because they going to face death in
[1:08:19] a split second right yeah
[1:08:22] right see the real you down inside of
[1:08:28] there brother around explaining about
[1:08:31] the
[1:08:32] lady that was
[1:08:35] dying then preacher remembered lied to
[1:08:38] her and kept giving her highst to knock
[1:08:40] her out you kept saying you preacher you
[1:08:42] lie he said her real Soul come up before
[1:08:45] her and she seen she was lost even
[1:08:49] though she used to teach Sunday school
[1:08:51] she used to do all kind of things
[1:08:54] he said when that starts breaking away
[1:08:56] in your body
[1:09:00] right he said you'll come to the real
[1:09:02] you right well I'd rather find it out
[1:09:06] now and find my real me and do something
[1:09:08] about it
[1:09:10] you
[1:09:12] listen Jesus even said my
[1:09:16] soul is troubled look at the next one
[1:09:19] Psalms
[1:09:21] 34:22 the Lord redeemeth the soul of his
[1:09:26] servants and none of them that trust in
[1:09:28] him shall be
[1:09:31] desolate God is trying to redeem the
[1:09:35] soul he's not trying to redeem your body
[1:09:38] he paid the price that'll be in the
[1:09:39] resurrection and the change
[1:09:43] Etc he's trying to redeem your
[1:09:46] soul he gave his
[1:09:49] soul
[1:09:52] right did wasn't just a spirit hanging
[1:09:55] on a cross right there was a man hanging
[1:10:00] there there was a very man he was God
[1:10:03] himself amen amen that was the soul of
[1:10:05] almighty God look at look at
[1:10:08] 19 souls in prison now watch him when he
[1:10:11] gets here and he'll say the nature of
[1:10:13] the spirit 63
[1:10:16] 54 he was a prophet amen paragraph 36
[1:10:22] the soul of man is not the body of man
[1:10:25] it's the
[1:10:27] soul and the soul is something that's
[1:10:29] the nature of the
[1:10:32] spirit this same thing he said in
[1:10:35] 54 and then when the nature of a man
[1:10:38] like he said we are dead the scripture
[1:10:40] plainly tells us that we are dead and
[1:10:42] our lives are HID in God through
[1:10:46] Christ seal there by the holy
[1:10:48] spirit that wasn't that your body
[1:10:52] died it wasn't your spirit
[1:10:55] died it was the nature of your spirit
[1:10:58] amen died see the
[1:11:01] nature which is the
[1:11:05] soul
[1:11:07] yep see you two Soul people just saying
[1:11:10] the souls the nature of the spirit I
[1:11:12] quoted this quote to a man in
[1:11:13] Jeffersonville
[1:11:15] Indiana that was standing
[1:11:18] outside um the uh where they used to
[1:11:21] make the books Armory Armory
[1:11:25] and he kind of sniggered because this is
[1:11:27] what I quoted look at what brother R
[1:11:30] says the nature which is the soul the
[1:11:34] nature of your
[1:11:36] soul is God
[1:11:41] amenn if you're born you're born again
[1:11:45] amen he said because they always taught
[1:11:48] your soul was just a nature he said how
[1:11:50] can a nature have a
[1:11:52] nature
[1:11:54] I said argue with your
[1:11:57] Prophet I'm just telling you what he
[1:11:59] said but look how more beautiful could
[1:12:01] it be the nature of your soul is God if
[1:12:05] you're born again if it's
[1:12:08] not it's of the
[1:12:11] world the nature of your soul is God if
[1:12:13] you're born again if not the nature of
[1:12:16] your soul is the world right that's
[1:12:18] right is that plain sense yes anything
[1:12:21] to begin has to end so therefore the
[1:12:23] only way that you can have eternal life
[1:12:26] is to have a life that never did begin
[1:12:29] and then your life did begin when you
[1:12:30] were born when God breathed the breath
[1:12:32] of life into your nostril and you became
[1:12:34] a living Soul then you begin
[1:12:38] then look the next
[1:12:40] one I got 44 souls in
[1:12:44] prison but that Soul that's in there see
[1:12:50] that soul is what God is working on
[1:12:54] Now read that over and over and over
[1:12:56] don't get on down here and read the rest
[1:12:58] of this we'll read that read that
[1:13:01] statement over and over and
[1:13:03] over right and you'll see the Plan of
[1:13:07] Redemption that's right the soul is what
[1:13:10] God is working on that's right amen not
[1:13:12] working on your body what ises a
[1:13:14] preacher preach you quit this you quit
[1:13:16] that you get out of this you don't do
[1:13:18] that no more you can get saved Now
[1:13:20] where's the Bible for right he's not
[1:13:22] working on your body
[1:13:25] don't you believe in living good brother
[1:13:26] help
[1:13:28] no boy they cut that all now they'll be
[1:13:30] in a hurry bad one no I believe in being
[1:13:33] born
[1:13:34] again and when you're born again it'll
[1:13:36] take care of
[1:13:38] everything
[1:13:41] right don't you think you ought to live
[1:13:43] right no just get born again and let him
[1:13:48] live is that hard to
[1:13:52] understand and I know what the brain
[1:13:54] does and I said you don't believe in
[1:13:57] being good
[1:13:58] no you don't hear another word is
[1:14:03] say
[1:14:05] right it just cuts off I can't help
[1:14:09] that watch what he says now that soul is
[1:14:13] what God is working on right now reads
[1:14:15] your Prophet beautiful
[1:14:18] beautiful see if he can only get that
[1:14:22] nature
[1:14:25] that
[1:14:27] Spirit he didn't bother him to say
[1:14:29] Spirit soul and
[1:14:31] nature to agree with
[1:14:35] him then that nature
[1:14:41] dies the nature of the and the love of
[1:14:45] the world
[1:14:47] dies not your soul
[1:14:50] died he explained it the nature
[1:14:54] and love of the world right is what
[1:14:57] dies and the things that the world is of
[1:15:01] the world is dead if you love the world
[1:15:04] things of the world love of God is not
[1:15:05] in you and a man must be born again so
[1:15:08] this Nature has to die and the nature of
[1:15:11] God comes and lives in
[1:15:14] you right God is the only thing that
[1:15:18] never did begin and Never End Amen don't
[1:15:22] what he working on
[1:15:25] brother why is it you don't preach on
[1:15:27] high and dress and clothes all the
[1:15:34] time

[1:15:39] anybody saved that's
[1:15:41] right right well I've seen a lot of
[1:15:43] people cry come to the altar because
[1:15:46] that they beat them over the head about

[1:19:21] you that's number 20 pull up number
[1:19:29] 21 continual reading is what it
[1:19:33] is he never left his body see corruption
[1:19:36] neither did he leave his soul in Hell
[1:19:39] raised him up on the third day and he's
[1:19:41] alive forever
[1:19:42] more and we will have a body like his
[1:19:45] own glorious
[1:19:46] body that's why we're baptized in his
[1:19:49] name that we might come forth in his
[1:19:51] name
[1:19:53] in his death in his
[1:19:55] resurrection then we Rise Again
[1:19:57] testifying to the world that we have new
[1:19:59] life that the old man is Dead We buried
[1:20:03] that first
[1:20:05] nature what was the nature of your soul
[1:20:07] that we were reading our just a moment
[1:20:08] ago same message the nature of the soul
[1:20:12] is of the world when if it's born again
[1:20:14] it's of God right so he said what you
[1:20:17] buried that whole
[1:20:19] nature all
[1:20:21] right
[1:20:23] that old man is Dead We buried that
[1:20:25] first nature see that first nature is
[1:20:29] gone and then we are the nature of
[1:20:34] him see it wasn't your soul that died it
[1:20:37] wasn't your spirit that died it wasn't
[1:20:38] your body that died when you got born
[1:20:39] again it was the nature of that Soul yes
[1:20:43] which was of the
[1:20:45] world it died right then the nature of
[1:20:48] God comes in by the new
[1:20:50] birth into the soul
[1:20:54] listen he lives in us and we don't do
[1:20:56] our own
[1:20:58] will we do his will we don't think our
[1:21:01] own thoughts listen the mind the mind is
[1:21:06] what
[1:21:08] thinks the mind that was in Christ Jesus
[1:21:13] is an every believer that's right now
[1:21:16] that ain't a head
[1:21:18] transplant that's not knowledge right
[1:21:24] his mind was his soul right
[1:21:29] listen the mind that was in Christ Jesus
[1:21:32] has never been see there there is the
[1:21:35] soul Y
[1:21:39] what Paul said let the mind that was in
[1:21:41] Christ Jesus be in you to do
[1:21:43] what make you a new creature or creation
[1:21:49] right so God had to release that life
[1:21:53] that could have come back in you and I
[1:21:55] to give us a new birth and that's what
[1:21:58] we're speaking of now that's the part
[1:22:00] that I'm thinking of now that that's
[1:22:03] within us the
[1:22:08] soul that's what God come to die
[1:22:12] for and to do that he is to get his own
[1:22:15] soul now those Old Testament people
[1:22:17] could be Anointed with the spirit right
[1:22:20] right m
[1:22:24] you can talk about the nature of
[1:22:27] God you see that soul of God came to
[1:22:30] into
[1:22:30] being in Jesus Christ amen all
[1:22:35] right look the
[1:22:40] next the queen of sha bouncing back to
[1:22:44] 1960
[1:22:45] e75 God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:22:48] world to himself Jesus said it's not me
[1:22:51] that doth these things things it's my
[1:22:53] father I the son can do nothing in my in
[1:22:56] himself but what he sees the father
[1:22:58] doing and then when God was with God was
[1:23:01] with us God above us God With Us in
[1:23:05] Christ Emmanuel God With Us and then
[1:23:08] when the blood cell was broke at Calvary
[1:23:11] and the blood was shed the spirit under
[1:23:14] the old dispensation sin was just
[1:23:16] covered not forgiven covered because the
[1:23:19] blood of goats and Bulls could not take
[1:23:21] away sin and only cover but when the the
[1:23:25] the life that was in the animal that
[1:23:27] died life could not come back upon back
[1:23:31] and be a spirit within the human being
[1:23:35] because it was animal life without a
[1:23:37] soul go everybody make sure
[1:23:40] see but when Jesus
[1:23:44] died
[1:23:46] listen it was a soul of
[1:23:51] God
[1:23:54] and when the cell was broke it
[1:23:55] Sanctified a church that the Holy Spirit
[1:23:58] could come to live in us who were zexual
[1:24:01] born then it's God above us God With Us
[1:24:04] now it's God in
[1:24:07] us what
[1:24:10] happened God came
[1:24:13] down in a
[1:24:15] body the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:24:18] dwell in a man we call Jesus
[1:24:21] Christ
[1:24:23] and he gave his
[1:24:25] life if it is only the anointing of the
[1:24:28] spirit you need for a new birth brother
[1:24:30] R said the anointing left Jesus in the
[1:24:36] garden so you don't need him to die on
[1:24:39] the
[1:24:43] cross if all you need is a spiritual
[1:24:46] condition yeah
[1:24:49] right but what we need is the life of
[1:24:52] God God Amen right which is the soul of
[1:24:56] God
[1:24:58] right that's what we need we need God to
[1:25:01] come and live in
[1:25:03] us not just God With Us that's right but
[1:25:07] God to come and live in us that's
[1:25:13] right look at the next just give you the
[1:25:15] scripture First Corinthians
[1:25:21] 15:39 and All Flesh is not the same
[1:25:24] flesh but there's one kind of Flesh of
[1:25:26] men flesh of Beast another fish and
[1:25:28] birds they are also celestial bodies and
[1:25:32] bodies terrestrial but the glory of the
[1:25:35] celestial is one and the glory of the
[1:25:38] terrestrial is another one right okay
[1:25:41] just roll up quot right on
[1:25:45] another he Celestial
[1:25:49] body now what I'm going to be doing for
[1:25:51] a little bit is is making a point
[1:25:54] Celestial is
[1:25:59] theop cuz brother going to use them
[1:26:01] together right in the same
[1:26:06] quote listen to message called life 1957
[1:26:09] let's close our eyes to imagination for
[1:26:11] a few moments and go way back in before
[1:26:14] there was before there was anything the
[1:26:15] great Fountain of all eternity with that
[1:26:18] Spirit of love joy that Spirit of
[1:26:20] honesty that Spirit of tress in this
[1:26:22] Perfection then out of the existence of
[1:26:24] the father went the logos which was the
[1:26:26] son which was the theophany which was
[1:26:29] the body of great Jehovah went forth in
[1:26:32] a
[1:26:33] Celestial body amen so a Celestial body
[1:26:37] is a theophan right theop is a Celestial
[1:26:41] body and you look it up in Webster
[1:26:43] theophany will give you basically the
[1:26:45] body of a deity
[1:26:47] right right but just
[1:26:50] remember a sinner
[1:26:55] as a Celestial form right for the
[1:27:02] soul and out of the exist then out of
[1:27:04] the existence the father went to Lo
[1:27:06] which was the son which was the
[1:27:07] theophany which was the body of the
[1:27:08] great Jehovah God went forth into in a
[1:27:11] Celestial body that's the logos word
[1:27:14] spoke out of them great Fountains of
[1:27:16] life and went there there was the
[1:27:17] theophany which was God made into word
[1:27:21] now you know what he's talking about
[1:27:23] and you begin to say Let There be
[1:27:26] right right the soul of almighty God
[1:27:29] came into existence as a word right now
[1:27:33] if you go study who is this
[1:27:35] mesic it will really help you
[1:27:38] right and that
[1:27:40] theophany was made flesh in the person
[1:27:44] of Jesus Christ
[1:27:46] amen that soul that Celestial being that
[1:27:50] God that's what said that God was in
[1:27:53] Christ reconciled in the
[1:27:56] world I don't like the way he
[1:27:59] talks in all of the fullness of the
[1:28:02] Trinity you got no problem using
[1:28:06] Trinity so long as you didn't believe
[1:28:08] there's three Gods with
[1:28:10] it dwell in him both Father Son and the
[1:28:14] Holy Spirit all in that and that's the
[1:28:16] way we go come back to the original
[1:28:18] beginning of
[1:28:19] God there we are born again
[1:28:23] not of Flesh born again not of blood but
[1:28:26] Born Again by the spirit and then an
[1:28:29] eternal spirit of love and honesty come
[1:28:31] down to make its place in us not on us
[1:28:35] right in us right and then when we die
[1:28:37] from this life we go into that body
[1:28:39] which if this Earthly T not going be
[1:28:42] dissolved we have the theop to go into a
[1:28:45] body
[1:28:46] Celestial so you use Celestial the
[1:28:50] ofing and just keep keep right on going
[1:28:53] all right couple more quotes will be
[1:28:57] through may have to have another cough
[1:28:59] drop but that's all right now let's drop
[1:29:03] back in 57 and
[1:29:05] read letage called
[1:29:08] inment here he
[1:29:10] goes where did he leave when he left
[1:29:13] they talk about Jesus right where did
[1:29:16] Jesus go when he
[1:29:19] left all right when preach to the souls
[1:29:21] and PR prison
[1:29:23] right he he ascended he went and
[1:29:27] preached to the souls that were in
[1:29:29] prison they repented not in the long
[1:29:30] suffering the days of Noah his soul his
[1:29:33] Spirit his theoy of his own being mhm
[1:29:38] amen went
[1:29:42] down word to
[1:29:44] Hell
[1:29:46] H let's follow him would you like to
[1:29:49] tonight to follow him a few minutes
[1:29:50] let's see where he went just below the
[1:29:52] regions of the Mortal being lays the
[1:29:55] realm of demon power below that just
[1:29:58] above that lays The Souls of unjust
[1:30:02] below it lays the very domain of Satan
[1:30:05] hell and just above us see that's going
[1:30:08] that way just above us lays the Holy
[1:30:11] Spirit then under the altar lays The
[1:30:13] Souls of the just men the next is God
[1:30:16] himself one going downward one going
[1:30:18] upward the two Spirits are here on the
[1:30:20] earth influencing the people people of
[1:30:22] this Earth is right here today one of
[1:30:24] the others influencing you right it's
[1:30:27] either an upward pull or a downward
[1:30:29] that's right amen if we're born again
[1:30:33] it's upward right if we're not born
[1:30:35] again you can't do nothing to be turn be
[1:30:37] pull downward right right right that's
[1:30:40] why you love the world and things of the
[1:30:42] world right all right look at the next
[1:30:47] one questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:30:50] 1957
[1:30:53] here his body was in the grave and his
[1:30:55] soul was in Hell preaching alive Y what
[1:30:59] about that he was in his theophany again
[1:31:03] his soul was down there with those
[1:31:05] people that were in theop also
[1:31:11] Y and was witness to them that are that
[1:31:16] to them they repented not in the
[1:31:18] longsuffering Y he didn't have any
[1:31:21] problem calling the sinner soul is the
[1:31:25] offing just remember the difference
[1:31:31] is if you're born again right your soul
[1:31:36] is of God if not it's of the
[1:31:39] world just simply means a body you go to
[1:31:42] see a sinner's got a body he goes to
[1:31:44] when he dies he just don't go out
[1:31:46] nonexistence right his soul
[1:31:50] goes somewhere
[1:31:53] when brother Brandon went beyond the
[1:31:55] curtain of time you remember he turned
[1:31:57] and looked back and saw his
[1:32:01] body laying
[1:32:05] there but his soul was under the altar
[1:32:09] right with them we'll get to that more
[1:32:10] on Wednesday all
[1:32:14] right go to the next I got two
[1:32:19] more but after the days of his preaching
[1:32:22] mhm his ministry continued
[1:32:25] on look cuz the last group he preached
[1:32:29] to was the souls that were in hell that
[1:32:31] could not be
[1:32:33] forgiven I have clearly read that from
[1:32:35] the Bible here from second Peter say he
[1:32:38] went and preached to souls that were in
[1:32:40] prison which is Hell locked up until the
[1:32:44] day of judgment now in Peter it says the
[1:32:48] spirit it doesn't say the word soul in
[1:32:52] nether it says the spirit of
[1:32:58] them but now the word is interchangeable
[1:33:01] right right amen the brother R when it
[1:33:04] told us what it said he says the soul
[1:33:07] right no no he don't it's that
[1:33:10] Spirit
[1:33:13] Well you going to deny everything he
[1:33:15] says that's all right go ahead here's
[1:33:18] the light then we'll pick up we'll take
[1:33:21] up this Wednesday night this is the FI
[1:33:24] seal 433 443 excuse me paragraph the FI
[1:33:29] seal is open there SE many other things
[1:33:32] if you caught it see I'm waiting on my
[1:33:34] question to see by all right now where
[1:33:37] was The Arc we done read this this
[1:33:39] morning the slain wounded bleeding
[1:33:42] bloody lamb for atonement or those
[1:33:44] odorous priers notice the Bible said if
[1:33:47] this Earthly Tabernacle of our Dwelling
[1:33:48] Place be dissolved we have one already
[1:33:51] be
[1:33:52] waiting now that's still still Jew right
[1:33:55] but this next words is THS where I seen
[1:33:58] those Saints that's the bride of Christ
[1:34:01] right so the fifth sealed You Fifth
[1:34:03] sealed
[1:34:06] Jew when they get eternal
[1:34:09] life they can come back but they can't
[1:34:11] move until
[1:34:13] then but their soul is their being right
[1:34:17] of what they
[1:34:18] are remember death only changes your
[1:34:21] dwell place
[1:34:23] right it's all it changes
[1:34:27] right and we don't believe no place that
[1:34:30] we can go and and and you know kind of
[1:34:33] maybe have a hopes of being
[1:34:37] saved we have to depend on it
[1:34:40] now we don't qualify for foolish virgins
[1:34:43] we may be foolish but we may not be
[1:34:45] virgins if we don't believe God's
[1:34:48] word but laying down the thought and
[1:34:51] then we we'll come back on it Wednesday
[1:34:53] night Jesus's Soul was his
[1:34:56] theoy the person of his being
[1:35:00] amen your soul is your theophany the
[1:35:04] person of your being whether you're born
[1:35:06] again or not
[1:35:08] right it is the person of your being
[1:35:11] that's right but if you're born again
[1:35:14] your nature the prophet said your soul
[1:35:16] is of God right amen that's sensible
[1:35:19] isn't it he gave his own life his soul
[1:35:22] comes into you into your soul not into
[1:35:24] your body or your spirit right it's his
[1:35:27] own life that's right cuz you can be
[1:35:29] anointed on your spirit and not not be
[1:35:31] not be
[1:35:33] salvation well how do I know brother
[1:35:36] Dale what about
[1:35:42] right that's the only way you'll ever
[1:35:44] know
[1:35:48] shouting Indians the prophet says does
[1:35:51] that
[1:35:52] like Wade said last night talking about
[1:35:54] her this morning or sometime you there
[1:35:56] singing while ago yeah you go down there
[1:35:58] to Georgia ball game and they're
[1:36:04] shouting does that mean they're
[1:36:08] save no that means it need to
[1:36:15] be
[1:36:17] R cuz you go to the ball game
[1:36:22] and you don't go to sleep yeah you don't
[1:36:25] sit all puffed
[1:36:33] up
[1:36:36] right you get in the spirit don't
[1:36:44] you right okay that's enough if you
[1:36:50] don't know what I'm talking about out
[1:36:51] you lost
[1:36:54] anyway we can enjoy the things of life
[1:36:57] there's nothing wrong going to a ball
[1:36:58] game that I see right not unless it's
[1:37:00] that's what captivates you right now if
[1:37:03] that's what captivates you I think it is
[1:37:04] wrong that's right deer hunting if
[1:37:06] that's what captivates your
[1:37:11] tra but different people are made
[1:37:13] different ways and like different things
[1:37:15] that's true told you the only time I
[1:37:18] went down to the
[1:37:19] Braves ballpark

[1:38:08] said won't you take your kids down there
[1:38:09] to go it out in California I think it
[1:38:12] was take your kids down there and they
[1:38:14] went Y and he went cuz that's where he
[1:38:17] seen the rat with the the stuff that
[1:38:20] they put on the smoke
