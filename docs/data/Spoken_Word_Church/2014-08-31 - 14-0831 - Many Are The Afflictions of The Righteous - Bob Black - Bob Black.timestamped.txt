[0:05] all right so
[0:06] what i want to do
[0:08] is read the whole chapter of psalm 34
[0:14] and kind of narrow down on verse 19 okay
[0:19] um before we do that let's go to the
[0:20] lord in prayer
[0:22] thank you lord god for your grace to us
[0:24] and for another day to serve you lord
[0:25] jesus i pray god that you'll be with the
[0:27] way in june and all the ones that can't
[0:28] be here today lord jesus bless the
[0:30] service this morning lord grant the lord
[0:32] that you'll open our hearts with jesus
[0:34] and give us things we have needed when
[0:35] we ask in the name of the lord jesus
[0:37] christ
[0:41] now the reason uh for those that are
[0:43] listening in we just read
[0:46] first samuel
[0:47] 19 through um i was planning to read
[0:50] through like 21.
[0:53] and the reason of that is kind of to
[0:55] talk about um
[0:58] we'll get to that in a second let's just
[1:00] read psalm 34
[1:02] uh i will bless the lord at all times
[1:05] his praise shall continually be in my
[1:07] mouth
[1:08] and you can see here that we didn't
[1:10] really get to this story in our reading
[1:12] the story of how uh david changed his
[1:15] behavior before big elect which you can
[1:17] see this this little note here in psalm
[1:19] 34
[1:20] this psalm was kind of written around
[1:23] the time when
[1:25] right after that little period in first
[1:27] samuel they were reading all these
[1:28] things were happening in david's life
[1:31] um he's getting chased by saul
[1:33] he uh runs away to uh
[1:37] the house of the lord where he's given
[1:39] the showbread and
[1:40] he runs over to the uh
[1:43] it goes through all these different
[1:44] experiences where he's being chased by
[1:46] people
[1:47] and i i think this song david kind of
[1:50] wrote songs as he was going through life
[1:53] you know um
[1:54] that you can uh
[1:57] there's a song of david in first samuel
[1:59] 22
[2:01] that he wrote right after he uh
[2:04] was delivered from saul and then there's
[2:06] that kind of starts off his life and
[2:08] there's a another song that he wrote
[2:10] more towards the end of his life and
[2:12] first samuel 23. and that's that'd be a
[2:16] good little exercise to read just kind
[2:17] of how david through his life
[2:20] he you can kind of see how he changed
[2:23] and um
[2:25] so that's what i want to talk about this
[2:26] morning is how how does god change us
[2:28] and we know you know by the way he's
[2:30] been bringing us through the statute of
[2:32] perfect man and how god uh changes us
[2:34] through the opening of the word and
[2:36] things
[2:37] and and there's many tools in god's
[2:40] arsenal and one of them is is affliction
[2:43] and suffering and a lot of times we'll
[2:45] think well why is god bringing suffering
[2:47] and things on why are we going through
[2:49] these things
[2:50] but all down through the all over the
[2:52] bible
[2:53] god uh every one of god's people has had
[2:56] to go through periods where things
[2:58] happen that seem out of the
[3:01] how
[3:02] you know why why if i'm serving god if
[3:04] i'm doing what's right
[3:06] why are these things happening
[3:09] why am i going through this period where
[3:10] it seems like a low a real low value why
[3:12] are there valleys and it's all part of
[3:15] god's plan it's all part of his purpose
[3:17] so maybe as david was writing this
[3:19] little song
[3:21] he was
[3:22] thinking about all the things that he
[3:24] had gone through and how god had
[3:25] delivered him and then we'll get down to
[3:27] verse 19 and which is what we'll focus
[3:29] on
[3:30] real quick i'm gonna try to kind of
[3:33] make wise use of the time
[3:36] uh verse two my soul shall make her
[3:39] boast and the lord they own shall hear
[3:41] thereof and be glad
[3:43] i'll magnify the lord with me and let us
[3:45] exalt his name together
[3:47] i sought the lord and he heard me and
[3:49] delivered me from all my fears
[3:53] now that's good because no matter what
[3:55] the devil brought no matter what
[3:58] temptations and trials
[4:00] god was still there to deliver him of
[4:02] his fears they looked unto him and were
[4:05] lightened and their faces were not
[4:06] ashamed this poor man cried and the lord
[4:08] heard him and saved him out of all his
[4:10] troubles
[4:11] the angel of the lord and encampeth
[4:13] round about them that fear him and
[4:15] deliver them the only way you can really
[4:17] know that the angel of the lord is
[4:18] camping around is that you've got a
[4:20] personal experience where you have uh
[4:22] it's one thing to talk about it but it's
[4:25] another to have lived through
[4:26] experiences just like david and job and
[4:30] all these men of the bible that paul
[4:32] that have gone through
[4:34] low valleys
[4:35] you can't have a testimony without a
[4:37] test
[4:38] you got to have something in your life
[4:40] that happens where you think well
[4:42] something's going to have to happen
[4:44] god's got to do something for me before
[4:46] you can have a testimony
[4:49] o taste and see that the lord is good
[4:52] blessed is the man that trusteth in him
[4:56] no fear the lord and his saints for
[4:58] there is no want to them that fear him
[5:02] young lions do lack and suffer hunger
[5:05] but they that seek the lord shall not
[5:06] want any good thing
[5:09] come you children hearken unto me i will
[5:11] teach you the fear of the lord
[5:15] now that's that's a good scripture you
[5:17] know
[5:18] one scripture that really sticks with me
[5:20] is over there in genesis chapter 18
[5:22] and we know the whole story of uh how
[5:24] abraham walked through the kind of the
[5:26] journey of a believer but they're in
[5:28] genesis at 18 i think it's verse 19
[5:30] through 21 god kind of just tells him
[5:33] the reason i'm telling you all these
[5:35] mysteries the reason why i chose you
[5:37] because i knew that you would teach your
[5:39] children
[5:40] and you know it goes all the way back to
[5:41] the garden of eden spiritual
[5:43] multiplication the whole point of of the
[5:45] plan to god to multiply himself and put
[5:48] himself in people and and now we're
[5:51] doing that by
[5:53] uh
[5:53] teaching sharing one another sharing the
[5:56] gospel and how can how could abraham be
[5:59] the father of nations without without
[6:01] teaching his children but you know
[6:03] natural and spiritual you can't
[6:05] that's that's the way the gospel spreads
[6:07] is by teaching
[6:09] and how important that is what man is he
[6:11] that desireth life and love with many
[6:13] days that he may see good
[6:15] keep thy tongue from evil in our lips
[6:17] from speaking god
[6:19] depart from evil and to do and do good
[6:21] seek peace and pursue it
[6:23] the eyes of the lord are upon the
[6:25] righteous and his ears are open under
[6:27] their cry
[6:28] the face of the lord is against them
[6:30] that do evil
[6:32] to cut off the remembrance of them from
[6:34] the earth
[6:35] the righteous cry and the lord heareth
[6:37] and delivereth them
[6:39] out of all their troubles
[6:41] now there's a there's a good statement
[6:44] that we believe that because
[6:46] you know sometimes the lord will send
[6:49] things but let things come upon you
[6:51] just as a you know as a test to see
[6:54] if you really believe his word to see
[6:56] and i believe many times to to expose to
[7:00] you
[7:01] that you really believe it after you
[7:03] come through these trials and things
[7:04] that you can look back and say wow i
[7:06] really do believe god
[7:10] the lord is nine to them that are of a
[7:12] broken heart
[7:16] and saviors such as be of a contrite
[7:18] spirit
[7:19] many are the afflictions of the
[7:21] righteous
[7:22] but the lord delivereth him out of them
[7:24] all
[7:25] he keepeth all his bones
[7:27] not one of them is broken
[7:31] evil shall slay the wicked
[7:33] and they that he the righteous shall be
[7:35] desolate
[7:36] the lord redeemeth the soul of his
[7:38] servants
[7:39] and none of them that trust in him shall
[7:41] be desolate
[7:44] now
[7:46] if you look at this scripture which you
[7:48] just have to look at in your bible we
[7:50] don't have it up here but
[7:51] this is kind of two parts
[7:53] many other afflictions of the righteous
[7:55] and i i i you know i read what i got
[7:58] this book by saint thomas aquinas
[8:00] that he a lot of uh
[8:04] a lot of people kind of put so much
[8:06] focus on suffering like he did
[8:08] that you almost uh he almost kind of
[8:14] you gotta balance it out because
[8:15] suffering by itself
[8:18] doesn't bring character you gotta have
[8:21] the opposite of this the other part of
[8:23] the equation the lord god brings them
[8:25] out of them all right now that's what
[8:27] differentiates because
[8:29] when i go to work every day i see the
[8:31] plenty of people that are going through
[8:32] suffering
[8:33] sitting on the side of the road begging
[8:35] people on the train that are
[8:37] so drugged up you know that they can't
[8:39] even sit up and
[8:40] and people police escorting people off
[8:43] the train that have used the bathroom on
[8:44] themselves and all kinds of horrible
[8:46] things that you'd say well they're going
[8:48] through horrible afflictions
[8:49] and and people at work that are
[8:52] so wrapped up in the sin of the world
[8:55] and different things all around i
[8:57] remember when i was
[8:59] a real young person i remember hearing
[9:02] one of my friends talking about his
[9:04] older brother and he said
[9:06] well he said when i i go to work and i
[9:09] i come home and i drink a beer and i go
[9:11] to bed and i get up next morning i just
[9:12] do it all over again
[9:14] well
[9:15] that's
[9:16] that's affliction you know you're an
[9:18] affliction of sin affliction that sounds
[9:31] so it's
[9:33] you know the bible says the timing has
[9:35] happened to all me and every it's not a
[9:37] uh uncommon thing for you to get a flat
[9:40] tire or go through things that are just
[9:42] part of life problems of life and things
[9:44] but what's different about a christian
[9:47] is that we've got something
[9:51] to relieve the pressure
[9:57] y'all excuse me a second
[10:01] because brother ryan preached that he
[10:03] preached that letting off pressure like
[10:05] five or six times and he talks about
[10:08] how the
[10:09] the things of the world will just heap
[10:11] up on you and
[10:13] yes lord yes
[10:19] you get all this um you know what
[10:20] affliction is
[10:22] is suffering and distress i just wrote
[10:24] some new stuff pain trouble misery
[10:28] hardship misfortune
[10:30] adversity sorrow torment tribulation woe
[10:34] and and all these things come upon
[10:36] people uh
[10:37] but but their god pays this is like a
[10:40] tool in his arsenal to to use to to
[10:44] cause to prod as a believer to cause us
[10:48] to move closer to him to build our
[10:50] character and move to to to draw us
[10:54] to to put us more in fellowship with him
[10:57] and you know hebrews 12 5 he says now
[10:59] you have forgotten the exhortation which
[11:01] speaketh unto you as unto children my
[11:03] son despise not they are the chastening
[11:05] of the lord
[11:06] nor faith when thou i repeat to him for
[11:09] whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[11:11] and scourgeth every son whom he
[11:13] receiveth if you endure chastening god
[11:16] deal dealth with you as with sons for
[11:18] what son has even the father chasteneth
[11:20] not
[11:21] but if you be without chastisement
[11:24] whereof all are partakers
[11:27] then are you bastards and not sons
[11:30] well that's
[11:33] in other words
[11:35] is
[11:36] every single child of god has got to
[11:38] come through chastisement through
[11:43] you say well i haven't done anything
[11:45] wrong
[11:46] you know i'm living i'm living as close
[11:48] to god as i can
[11:49] like job who said that who god said
[11:52] there ain't there ain't nobody in the
[11:53] world like joe nobody on the whole
[11:55] planet that's living as faithful as job
[11:58] is this man stands alone
[12:00] and here comes the devil says prove it
[12:02] right i can i can change the
[12:04] circumstance
[12:05] and make him just believe you
[12:07] but yet god jokes stood true and it
[12:09] didn't matter what the circumstance was
[12:11] his faith healed strong
[12:13] and
[12:14] and that's what
[12:17] i thought
[12:21] it makes makes you get emotional
[12:26] that's what a lot of times
[12:28] god will will let things come upon you
[12:31] to see what you're going to do
[12:33] to make manifest his word in you
[12:35] because let's say let's say that you
[12:37] have matured up the statue of a perfect
[12:39] man and all these virtues are in you
[12:41] now let's see it prove it
[12:43] maybe the devil will say this yeah
[12:46] that's uh
[12:48] or god will uh
[12:50] allow
[12:51] an evil spirit to go give you a little
[12:54] trial bring you down a little bit take
[12:56] something that you hold dearly away from
[12:58] you and see what you're gonna do
[13:01] see see what you're really made of
[13:08] and
[13:10] i just kind of wrote a little list of
[13:12] all the people that have suffered
[13:13] affliction
[13:14] you know in hebrews 11 it's written that
[13:16] moses
[13:18] counted the affliction of god as as
[13:21] greater than the all the traitors in
[13:23] egypt
[13:24] and he made a choice that he would
[13:26] rather have
[13:27] the affliction of god
[13:29] than to have
[13:30] all the gold all the power he turned all
[13:33] of that down
[13:34] and you know you know the whole story
[13:36] about how it all really started the
[13:38] prodding that golden of god started when
[13:41] he was a little child sitting on his
[13:42] mama knee hit his mom's knee as his mama
[13:45] was telling you're not really one of
[13:47] these egyptian
[13:49] people i'll tell you where you really
[13:50] came from
[13:52] you you're you're you've got a different
[13:54] birth you've got your uh you're just
[13:56] special child and and whatnot
[13:59] and and that's what what god i'm gonna
[14:02] jump ahead what god does is he'll he'll
[14:05] go
[14:07] he'll go just like he go to
[14:09] paul
[14:11] he said why are you kick against kick
[14:12] against the pricks when that pillar of
[14:14] fire appeared before paul now kicking
[14:16] against the priests there's a scripture
[14:17] in deuteronomy where it says a speaking
[14:19] of israel just your room you're you've
[14:22] gotten fat
[14:23] and you're kicking and i'm just
[14:25] paraphrasing because i don't have it
[14:27] written down but
[14:28] in other words israel had gotten all big
[14:30] and every time the word of the lord came
[14:32] out they an ox code is like this big
[14:34] stick and they would they would steer
[14:36] they would nudge the ox along to go one
[14:38] way or the other with this oxygen with a
[14:40] big iron point on the end so
[14:43] imagine god nudging israel along they
[14:45] just got so fat and lazy you know they
[14:47] just don't care anymore and and god's
[14:49] problem along and they they're kicked
[14:51] like an ox kicking back and and uh
[14:54] and that's what god told paul why i'm
[14:56] trying to get you to go in the direction
[14:58] that i want you to go
[15:00] why are you kicking against the pricks
[15:02] and you know the pricks the pricks about
[15:04] god's occurred is his word when he was
[15:07] there standing and he saw stephen
[15:09] the life of god made manifest when he
[15:12] saw the life of god the same life that
[15:14] was in christ may manifest as stephen
[15:17] you know something prickly in his heart
[15:18] and that was like something is different
[15:20] about this i've never seen anything like
[15:22] this before and then that pillar of fire
[15:24] appeared before him and he said and hey
[15:26] god told him you're i'm trying to steer
[15:29] you in a particular direction but you're
[15:31] not listening to my
[15:33] to my call ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse
[15:36] 11
[15:38] says the words of the wise
[15:40] are as goods
[15:42] and as nails fastened by the masters
[15:45] of assemblies
[15:47] which are given from one shepherd
[15:50] the words of the wise
[15:52] now who's got wisdom
[15:54] who's got wisdom in this day but the the
[15:57] holy ghost feel a believer that's where
[15:59] real wisdom wisdom only comes from god
[16:02] wisdom on it you only find today you
[16:04] only find wisdom in the message
[16:07] listening to the tapes listening to
[16:08] somebody that knows what they're talking
[16:10] about
[16:11] yes and those words of wisdom are like
[16:13] goats that's why
[16:16] i i've been kind of thinking all this
[16:17] why
[16:18] why do we get now when when the real
[16:21] words of wisdom come forth when you
[16:24] listen to a tape
[16:25] or listening to it sitting in church why
[16:28] do we get offended a lot of times well
[16:30] the reason is that i believe
[16:32] is because we wrap our ideas we wrap
[16:35] ourselves around these little ideas that
[16:37] we've held for so long
[16:39] that we believe that
[16:40] we've got these little ideas and things
[16:42] that we we we're pretty sure this is
[16:44] right whether it's about something
[16:47] small or something great something uh
[16:49] we've got these little ideas about god's
[16:51] word and when god's word comes across
[16:54] the pulpit or comes from the tape
[16:56] because his word is sharper than a
[16:58] two-inch sword going all the way down to
[17:00] the mirror of the bone what's in the
[17:01] mirror that that's where the the blood
[17:03] is made right in the mirror of the bone
[17:06] that's where the life is right so when
[17:08] that sword of god's word goes all the
[17:10] way down and says well i'll see what's
[17:12] down here
[17:14] then you got you're all wrapped up in
[17:16] your own little ideas and you say well i
[17:18] i oh that hurts that hurt i
[17:21] i had this little idea about the way
[17:23] that was supposed to work i had this
[17:25] idea about
[17:26] how how i was supposed to conduct myself
[17:28] or whatever and that and that hurts and
[17:31] it causes offense of course you know
[17:33] there's lots of different offenses
[17:34] there's
[17:35] the the bible says that uh lord of them
[17:38] who by whom offenses come and that's
[17:39] that's speaking of a different offense
[17:41] it's offensive when it was offensive
[17:43] when jesus was hung on the tree that was
[17:45] in the fields offense when when peter
[17:47] was hung upside down that was offensive
[17:49] but and as
[17:51] we can also be offended when the word of
[17:53] god comes forth in wisdom and we need to
[17:56] watch that out because
[17:58] the words of the wise are his goats
[18:00] trying to steer us into the right path
[18:02] and the right path
[18:04] is the purpose the end goal is to get us
[18:07] into the image of god
[18:08] and that's what all this is doing is
[18:10] god's using this as a tool in his
[18:12] arsenal
[18:14] to move us in the direction he'll give
[18:16] us he'll send us little trials and
[18:18] tribulations and things
[18:21] and you've got to have trials you've got
[18:24] to have those experiences where
[18:26] it seems like all your friends have
[18:28] turned away it seems like maybe
[18:29] everybody at church doesn't really care
[18:31] anymore it seems like everything nothing
[18:33] is going right
[18:35] but
[18:36] you know all those little things are
[18:37] just orchestrated perfectly by god to
[18:40] make you turn to him
[18:42] because there's nobody you can depend on
[18:44] like god there's no friend like him and
[18:46] when you when he becomes your friend
[18:48] which is his goal
[18:50] that's what his his purpose is for you
[18:52] to have a personal relationship with him
[18:54] so that he can make himself manifest in
[18:56] you that's right
[18:57] then everything else that then all the
[19:00] pressure is let off
[19:02] it lets off all the pressure
[19:04] who cares who cares what anybody says
[19:06] about you who cares when uh
[19:08] you know men are avail you or or say
[19:11] things against you because you've got
[19:13] him as well
[19:15] and that's the main thing
[19:19] and now brother brown taught i got like
[19:21] just a few minutes
[19:23] then brother brown talked about how that
[19:24] when you get the new birth
[19:26] and we know all we've heard this for
[19:28] over and over that when the when you get
[19:29] the new birth the devil all those guns
[19:32] are turned at you
[19:33] and you know the new birth that's what i
[19:35] always tell my kids the new birth does
[19:36] not make you a robot christian that
[19:38] immediately you all you're going to do
[19:40] is just to i believe you know
[19:43] you're still like brother said even
[19:45] ministers have to watch out for that
[19:46] because we'll start uh
[19:49] you know he said
[19:50] we're not
[19:51] made of stuff sawdust
[19:53] we're flesh and blood that's right and
[19:55] we i
[19:56] we gotta watch that because you will
[19:58] start thinking why are people you know
[20:00] why why are people not living like a
[20:02] robot like do it just
[20:04] you know moving along just perfect in
[20:06] alignment just doing everything
[20:08] perfectly because we we've all got
[20:10] mistakes we've all got little problems
[20:12] that we struggle with and and
[20:14] it it behooves us to
[20:17] bear with one another and and be patient
[20:20] and long-suffering because we all have
[20:23] problems we've all well that's what
[20:24] we're all we're all going through this
[20:26] this struggle of life
[20:28] to complete the race
[20:30] to get to the end yes and we've all got
[20:32] that one goal in mind that's right so
[20:34] let's um
[20:36] be patient with one another as we go
[20:38] through the afflictions and trials of
[20:40] life
[20:41] bearing with one another bearing one
[20:42] another's burdens let me hear them
[20:55] that's not bob's time
[20:57] oh no
[20:59] is there
[21:05] all right well we'll see we'll see what
[21:07] time the bell rings
[21:09] so we'll just play it right here
[21:19] now i was listening we were listening to
[21:20] letting off preacher this morning coming
[21:22] to church and and um
[21:24] brother was that was a he made a
[21:26] statement in there about how uh
[21:28] that brother brown unless these things
[21:30] that god lets these things come on you
[21:31] so he could test the building
[21:33] now isn't that so good after all we've
[21:35] heard by the way teach y'all and
[21:36] everything what build is he testing he's
[21:39] testing that building yeah he's testing
[21:41] the scene how it's all sealed together
[21:43] that's right and uh not how it's all
[21:45] sealed again though to to prove to you
[21:48] what god has done for you
[21:50] that you really do have god in this
[21:52] thing right now you have patience all
[21:53] these different things questions
[21:56] uh well he preached he preached it five
[21:59] or six times i think the first time was
[22:00] in 1961
[22:03] as the one we were listening to
[22:07] um
[22:08] so he's testing that building
[22:10] testing that out just like um
[22:13] zerubbabel with his plumb line which you
[22:16] know he's measuring it up against the
[22:17] word of god to see everything he's just
[22:19] right and that's what he does when he
[22:21] brings these little afflictions and
[22:23] trials and things on you to see do you
[22:25] really believe him like abraham do you
[22:28] really believe that god's going to give
[22:29] you a child
[22:30] now
[22:32] what's that a lamb
[22:34] exactly exactly yes
[22:37] let's just um we just have a few minutes
[22:41] so now here's one we've all heard before
[22:44] is it possible for a holy ghost person
[22:46] to be driven by the driven body to do
[22:48] minor things influenced to do minor
[22:50] things that he doesn't want to do
[22:52] oh yes yes sir
[22:55] in other words
[22:57] are you gonna have trouble after you get
[22:58] the holy ghost is the devil gonna come
[23:00] after you are you gonna have problems
[23:03] with things
[23:04] or is it gonna are you gonna be a robot
[23:06] christian they don't have no problems
[23:08] the devil just shoots his arrows
[23:10] you know no problems at all you're just
[23:12] walking around impervious to uh
[23:14] everything but you god don't take your
[23:17] free will away you still have the the uh
[23:20] the ability to choose
[23:22] to choose whether to pray to choose
[23:25] whether to read the bible to choose
[23:26] rather
[23:29] so he says yeah a holy ghost field
[23:30] person you're right in the place then to
[23:32] be drove by these things you just put
[23:35] yourself up a target
[23:39] think about that now what a privilege to
[23:41] be a target for the devil
[23:45] now don't take me wrong now
[23:47] you know you don't want to volunteer say
[23:48] devil come at me lord have mercy let's
[23:52] not do that
[23:53] but
[23:54] to be in a place where god
[23:57] you know
[23:59] to have the holy ghost and
[24:02] be trying to do right and because the
[24:03] devil don't they never don't care
[24:05] until until you've got the holy ghost
[24:07] until you're lit trying to do right and
[24:09] trying to live right then
[24:11] you know he's got all his guns on
[24:12] because he's trying to
[24:14] he's trying to uh
[24:16] see what he can do that's right
[24:19] it's a it's a privilege to serve god
[24:21] it's a privilege to be a witness it's a
[24:23] privilege to go into work and be a
[24:25] witness to all the people that uh of
[24:27] what
[24:28] i was reading i think is first timothy
[24:30] where paul told timothy
[24:32] don't worry about you know you won't be
[24:34] a testimony don't worry about uh
[24:39] being i forget how he said it but don't
[24:40] worry about being shy about the gospel
[24:42] trying to encourage him because it's a
[24:44] privilege to carry the gospel it's a
[24:46] privilege to um
[24:48] to bear the approach of the gospel and
[24:50] that's what i mean about
[24:52] um
[24:53] being a target for the devil i hope
[24:55] nobody misinterpreted that
[24:57] and uh in faith and then if you don't
[24:59] just like salvation you accept christ
[25:01] and the first thing you know immediately
[25:03] the devil take how many ears born again
[25:05] let's see your hands praise the lord for
[25:07] that how many was tempted and went
[25:08] through temptation immediately after he
[25:10] was born again
[25:12] let's see your hands every one of you
[25:15] and there's there's a scripture for
[25:17] matthew 4 1. that was jesus led up right
[25:19] after the type of the new birth then
[25:22] with jesus this is the holy spirit
[25:23] descending on him then was jesus led up
[25:25] with the spirit into the wilderness to
[25:26] be tempted of the devil so right after
[25:28] that
[25:31] the angel and the commission
[25:35] as
[25:36] things
[25:37] of life don't always come upon you god
[25:39] hasn't sent it just because you've done
[25:41] something wrong not it not every time
[25:45] it's not every time it's like that
[25:46] remember the boys of the gate they said
[25:48] who who sinned he or his father or his
[25:50] mother remember that jesus said in this
[25:52] case neither that the works of god might
[25:54] be known
[25:56] that the works of god might be known now
[25:59] the works of god
[26:01] is that
[26:02] so that you can make manifest what god
[26:04] has done in your life
[26:06] to prove that he's done something
[26:08] to prove that you got temperance
[26:10] that's you know when you got at work and
[26:12] that's what he talked about letting off
[26:13] the pressure that people will come and
[26:15] and uh i always think it's funny when
[26:17] i'm driving into work and there's just
[26:19] traffic for miles all as far as you can
[26:21] see there's traffic and somebody get
[26:23] behind you in one of those little
[26:24] teeny-weeny cars and just kind of you
[26:26] know all that pressure's building up and
[26:27] they just can't always stand it i got in
[26:29] traffic the other day and i got all i
[26:30] got on i was getting on the train and
[26:32] there was somebody in the elevator that
[26:33] she just
[26:34] at the train station and she just
[26:35] couldn't hardly stand it i've been in
[26:37] traffic for two hours
[26:38] i just can't hardly stand it
[26:40] because pressure had built up so much
[26:43] and and that and you know so when the
[26:46] pressure builds up got a little trial
[26:48] come to see if you really got tempers
[26:50] and and prove to you or
[26:52] whether you really got virtue all these
[26:54] different little trial patients
[26:57] patience is do you really believe that
[26:59] god will bring deliverance do you really
[27:01] believe that god will save your children
[27:04] are you patient enough to wait and rest
[27:06] in him knowing that he hears and
[27:08] answered prayers can you can you rest
[27:11] yeah i drive all the time that
[27:13] the thing to do is just go with the
[27:15] floor you have nothing you can do you
[27:16] know you still want to do a car so you
[27:18] know
[27:33] he has
[27:35] you can pray a disease or a
[27:37] situation or for somebody that god would
[27:39] want
[27:40] exactly
[27:43] oh yes
[27:44] yes that's why
[27:46] he was always very careful
[27:50] because
[27:51] sometimes that's a purpose that god is
[27:53] doing when i pray about stuff a lot of
[27:55] times i'll say
[27:56] your will yeah
[27:58] i
[27:59] i don't know from reading that before or
[28:02] something like that before but i do do
[28:04] that
[28:05] now a lot of times he would let sickness
[28:08] come upon people because of sin and then
[28:09] through the discernment he would uncover
[28:11] hidden sin or whatever in their life
[28:13] but remember when when people came to
[28:15] jesus in the new testament when they
[28:16] came to him there's not one recorded
[28:18] evidence i can ever turn anybody away
[28:20] because his desire and that's one of the
[28:22] good things and love by that book by ff
[28:24] bosworth his desire is always to him and
[28:27] and i think um you know
[28:30] if you had some time see what brother
[28:31] ram said about that thorn in the flesh
[28:32] that y'all gave paul it might not be
[28:35] what we think let's let's stop right
[28:36] there
[28:37] can i get a copy of you
[28:42] okay
