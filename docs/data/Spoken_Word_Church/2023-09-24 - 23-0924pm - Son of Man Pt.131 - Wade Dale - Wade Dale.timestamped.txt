[2:17] give us and also a prayer request so
[2:19] I'll let him do that at this time
[2:25] all right good afternoon
[2:27] I'll try to be brief with this A
[2:29] co-worker by the name was Cheryl Mack
[2:32] I've requested prayer for she was on the
[2:35] cancer list
[2:36] and uh
[2:38] anyway I hadn't heard from her in some
[2:40] time and some someone ran the first of
[2:42] August she came in to plant
[2:44] and uh you know cancer she was had
[2:46] cancer 20 some mod years ago and uh the
[2:49] Lord healed of
[2:51] and uh
[2:52] she came to me earlier this year she and
[2:54] almost in tears she said
[2:56] pray for me
[2:58] it's okay
[2:59] she came back
[3:02] so anyway Joe was dear to me I'm you
[3:05] know you meet these people that
[3:06] you know you just connect with you know
[3:08] and she's she's just a great person her
[3:10] mother and her sister too yeah they all
[3:12] used to wear them man
[3:14] but uh
[3:17] she came in somewhere around the first
[3:19] of August and she said things are
[3:21] looking good then
[3:22] I'm coming back that's good but she had
[3:25] to be back by somewhere around the last
[3:27] of August
[3:28] you're only allowed so much time to be
[3:31] off
[3:32] and she didn't make it back
[3:34] they're talking I've not confirmed it
[3:36] but it's pretty
[3:39] pretty much spread that she has been
[3:41] been terminated she so if that's so
[3:44] within she does not have a job and no
[3:46] insurance
[3:47] well we still want to keep her in our
[3:49] prayers
[3:51] so she uh she's very special
[3:54] and uh
[3:58] but anyway we'll switch
[4:00] to my trucker buddy in Oklahoma
[4:03] I've requested prayer and got prayer
[4:05] claws even got a prayer cloth sure got
[4:08] prayer cloth and I sent them out there
[4:10] uh my trucker buddy said his
[4:12] sister-in-law had cancer
[4:14] so after several months I guess you know
[4:17] if we I don't get to talk to him very
[4:19] much the hello interesting passing when
[4:21] he comes here anyway I asked him I said
[4:24] well how's the sick folks
[4:25] he said man would you believe she is
[4:28] cancer-free that's what I think that's
[4:31] great
[4:35] so the same guy has a brother-in-law
[4:38] also got cancer
[4:41] from the way he talked his negative type
[4:43] guy and this
[4:45] and uh give him a prayer cloth and two
[4:48] or three days later he made some remark
[4:50] with a lot of good that done
[4:51] you know
[4:53] but the Lord does things in his own way
[4:55] his own time
[4:57] so last time I spoke to him about him he
[5:00] said you know he was a fairly big fellow
[5:02] weighed about 220. lost down to about
[5:05] 120. now all of a sudden things turned
[5:08] around
[5:09] he's gained his weight back and the
[5:10] doctors don't understand it
[5:12] well I do
[5:15] those of us who who believe we didn't
[5:18] you know
[5:19] now
[5:20] let's come on up to my needs

[25:57] blood
[25:59] y
[26:01] as our mind goes back
[26:04] even today we were talking about the
[26:06] token being applied over the door
[26:09] Lord your children back there in Israel
[26:12] they've gotten a they got in a tight
[26:14] they got in a land that wasn't theirs
[26:16] they got into a place that that they
[26:19] were being slaves they were being used
[26:21] and abused
[26:22] Lord we can see that now that we're not
[26:25] in a land that we're supposed to be
[26:27] we're not in our Promised Land we're
[26:29] being used and abused by the devil and
[26:32] his imps
[26:34] Lord this world is not our home
[26:37] Lord you did deliver them so I pray
[26:40] today that you'll Deliver Us Lord
[26:42] from Evil and and all the different
[26:44] things sickness Lord all the things that
[26:46] we many many many days you know we've
[26:49] been there in the close to the emergency
[26:51] room and just felt the pressure of of
[26:54] even the the nurses and doctors that
[26:56] were trying to treat so many people Lord
[26:59] our mind went back to
[27:01] when the prophet of God talked to about
[27:04] total chaos on this Earth after the
[27:06] bride leaves oh what's going to happen
[27:08] in those hospitals and what's going to
[27:10] happen with those emergency room people
[27:11] and the equipment and all the things
[27:13] that they'll need for this Mass
[27:15] casualties and all the things that are
[27:17] coming but Lord you you said you'd take
[27:19] us out of the hair before that
[27:21] you gave us a promise that we would not
[27:23] see that we might see small part but we
[27:26] will not see the fullness we will be
[27:28] taken away
[27:29] your wife
[27:31] is making herself ready now
[27:34] and now I pray Lord that we will come to
[27:36] that culmination that will go to a

[30:35] he's right here this is this is John
[30:38] chapter what John chapter 16 verse 12
[30:41] heading into John 17 which is the Lord

[30:46] spirit of Truth has come he will guide
[30:48] you into all truth all right for he
[30:50] shall not speak of himself
[30:53] he has not spoken of himself
[30:55] for 2 000 years
[30:58] we speak of him as our husband but he
[31:01] has spoke to us as the bride and then he
[31:04] had in the end time he put a stamp on it
[31:07] through a prophet that says I now call
[31:09] you bride not church
[31:13] for he shall not speak of himself but
[31:16] whatsoever look
[31:18] whatsoever he shall hear
[31:21] that shall he speak
[31:24] through who
[31:25] through us
[31:27] right all right
[31:28] and he will show you bride
[31:31] things to come
[31:33] he don't have to show himself things to
[31:34] come he knows what's to come he's the
[31:37] one in his hair them coming and going
[31:38] and knows about tomorrow yesterday and
[31:40] every other day but he will show you the
[31:43] bride he's going to transfer all that to
[31:45] the bride
[31:46] and show you things to come I thought
[31:49] man that scripture if we just read it
[31:51] like that that'll just it'll just put
[31:53] all the influence on Jesus Christ but
[31:55] he's putting all the emphasis on us so
[31:57] let him put the emphasis on us and he
[31:59] has and he did and he will all right for
[32:02] he shall not speak of himself
[32:05] so so you know what I hear bride bride
[32:08] bride bride I love you you're my bride
[32:10] I'm gonna talk to you I'm going to tell
[32:12] you about me but I'm going to tell you
[32:14] through my bride about me
[32:17] hey man you love that I love that that's
[32:19] just wonderful and show you things to
[32:22] come
[32:23] so he's going to show you Revelation
[32:25] he's going to give you insight into
[32:27] tomorrow
[32:32] what a mighty God we serve that's why
[32:35] the Holy Ghost is that whole Center of
[32:37] that scripture is the Holy Ghost In You
[32:39] that whole Center is here it's not yes
[32:41] him I know it's him but he has decided
[32:45] he's decided to give all things listen
[32:47] he decided to put all things in the sun
[32:49] did he not
[32:51] 20 said I put all things up look and I
[32:55] believe it's in John 17 he he's
[32:56] committed all things to the son
[33:00] so now where's the son of man
[33:02] he's in me and you
[33:04] not over there
[33:07] right here
[33:09] and he's going to speak of him through
[33:12] you
[33:14] Mrs
[33:15] Jesus Christ
[33:17] amen
[33:20] Revelations 19 6.
[33:23] and I heard it's a word the voice of
[33:24] multitude is the voice of many Waters
[33:27] Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for
[33:30] the Lord God omnipotent reignless in
[33:31] other words something happened before
[33:33] that Thunder we'll talk about that a
[33:35] little bit later on let us be glad and
[33:37] rejoice and give honor to him now Look
[33:39] to Him
[33:41] but he's fixing to talk about his wife
[33:43] he's fixing to brag on her
[33:46] I I want people to brag on June I don't
[33:49] care if they you brag on me or not
[33:51] brag on her
[33:53] she's the one that gets all the honors
[33:55] she's the one that takes a lot of the
[33:56] loads she's the one that's the the you
[33:58] know they saw the matriarch of the
[34:00] family sure we're the man we're supposed
[34:01] to be the manly guy and all that but we
[34:04] also are the bride so we should be a
[34:06] little bit on the feminist side knowing
[34:07] that the Lord is our head
[34:10] all right but now what did he decide to
[34:12] do like I said before he decided to talk
[34:14] about us
[34:16] and he didn't just decide to talk about
[34:17] us through him he decided to talk about
[34:20] us through us that's what he just said
[34:24] he's not going to talk of himself
[34:25] anymore he put everything into his bride
[34:28] everything he's put into the bride
[34:31] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[34:33] and his wife
[34:34] hath made herself ready and to her it
[34:36] was granted that she should be arrayed
[34:38] and find linen clean and white
[34:40] that's what this statue of perfect man
[34:42] is doing folks is cleaning us up
[34:45] not in our soul if you're born again
[34:47] you're already clean but he's cleaning
[34:50] us up in our daily walk our spiritual
[34:52] being the spirit part of us the memories
[34:54] and conscious affection and Imagination
[34:57] all right for the fine linen is the
[35:00] righteousness of saints First Peter 1
[35:03] verse 22 says seeing you have purified
[35:05] your souls now we're going to today
[35:07] we'll break this down we didn't get time
[35:09] to do it this morning

[35:12] y'all didn't enjoy listening then I'm
[35:14] you know sorry I'm not bragging on me I
[35:17] want God to get something to you I want
[35:18] you to see something all right I want
[35:20] you to like and listen like the same
[35:23] thing as the husband and the wife

[35:30] and we you know I want everybody in this
[35:33] building to get it
[35:35] I know you can't get it same equal but I
[35:38] want you to guess I'm
[35:39] I don't want to leave nobody behind
[35:44] I do not I like the marine and motto you
[35:47] know no man left behind you know what if
[35:49] there's one guy go get him
[35:51] all right bro Donnie you gotta go get
[35:53] him you're not gonna get on that
[35:54] helicopter
[35:56] with somebody's still there
[35:58] we're gonna get back off head right back
[36:01] into the face of the enemy
[36:04] and get that Soul get that person and
[36:07] bring them back
[36:08] that's what we should have every one of
[36:10] us should be all don't ever count
[36:12] anybody off or out
[36:15] want them all to come okay I do I want
[36:17] us all to make it together
[36:20] seeing you have purified your souls in
[36:22] obeying the truth through the spirit
[36:24] now look oh we'll talk about Soul spirit
[36:27] and Body in just a few minutes all right
[36:29] all right we're going to talk about Soul
[36:30] spirit and adoption all right we'll see
[36:33] that in just a minute I want to break it
[36:34] apart real quick so that we can see
[36:37] really why this statue of perfect man is
[36:39] so important
[36:40] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[36:43] that you love one another with a pure
[36:44] heart
[36:45] fervently being born again not of
[36:48] corruptable seed but of incorrupt well
[36:50] in other words corruptable seed has been
[36:52] down through the church ages because
[36:54] we're going to read here just in a
[36:55] minute when we read this morning where
[36:56] Satan got into the church
[36:58] made it cold formal and Powerless how
[37:01] did he do that through preaching he took
[37:03] corruptable seed now look he took
[37:05] corruptable seed and made the
[37:07] congregation think it was incorruptible
[37:13] think it was the truth
[37:16] you know if you tell a lie so many times
[37:18] to somebody they're just going to
[37:19] believe it
[37:21] a man that was a boy we used to hunt
[37:23] with we was talking about the other day
[37:24] brought back memories Tony was a little
[37:27] he's a he was a little bit slow but
[37:30] he never shot that deer he wasn't even
[37:32] nowhere around we convinced that boy by
[37:34] the time I'm sorry we
[37:36] lied to him so much so he was telling
[37:39] people that he shot him by the time we
[37:40] got to guessville
[37:43] and believed it and he never pulled the
[37:46] trigger
[37:48] so you tell somebody something enough
[37:50] they're going to believe it if you tell
[37:52] it to them and make it real tantalizing
[37:54] you know
[37:56] so but that's corruptable seed
[37:59] but I'm Incorruptible by the word of God
[38:02] so the only way you're going to get
[38:03] Incorruptible seed is by the word of God
[38:05] which liveth and abideth forever it's a
[38:08] Living Word
[38:09] it's not a letter word it's a Living
[38:11] Word
[38:12] which liveth and about it forever
[38:15] that word there being born again
[38:19] means to produce again
[38:21] so in other words what I'm looking at is
[38:24] is that God produced a bride in the
[38:28] first church age
[38:29] as a day of Pentecost there was a Bride
[38:31] come out a mature bride now look that
[38:34] bride was mature on that day of
[38:35] Pentecost they had been taught by Jesus
[38:38] the word himself
[38:40] the word was made flesh
[38:42] he would they were taught and tutored
[38:44] and then all of a sudden whatever they
[38:46] had packed inside of them the Holy Ghost
[38:48] anointed that and then indwelled them
[38:51] and it quickened everything that they
[38:53] had taught been taught all right which
[38:55] put them right here
[39:01] so see that's not a new position to be
[39:04] in
[39:05] that's one we like
[39:08] because of us
[39:10] we like this because we've let man's
[39:14] Traditions we've let corruptible see
[39:16] don't say we I'm talking about the whole
[39:17] bride down through the church ages from
[39:20] the first church age to today there's
[39:22] been Parts as brother Ryan said Loose
[39:24] Ends
[39:26] that needed to be tied up all right and
[39:29] as I've always told you the way I look
[39:31] at it is is the word of God is eternal
[39:33] correct the word of God is not up and
[39:35] down and back and forth and there's no
[39:37] broken parts of the word of God because
[39:39] it's Eternal so you got this great
[39:42] strand of Eternity big rope running down
[39:44] through the church ages
[39:46] well when they got to nicaea they cut
[39:49] the rope
[39:50] follow us on Holy Ghost baptism we'll
[39:52] hear drops to two ends they come over
[39:54] here and say well there's a trinitarian
[39:56] oh yeah he's a trinity well they cut the
[39:58] rope Satan did and it dropped it down it
[40:00] didn't do away with the word it just
[40:03] took and cut a section out and that
[40:05] section dropped well then at the end
[40:06] time as God I'll read it to you just a
[40:09] minute brother Brown come here to do a
[40:11] job but even God said I will restore
[40:16] so that's a promise I will restore all
[40:18] the years
[40:21] 19 from from 80 30 to today so what did
[40:25] Brother Brown said he said that
[40:27] Messenger will tie up all the Loose Ends
[40:29] so he grabbed this rope and this rope
[40:31] tied them back together
[40:33] goes over here and he takes this rope
[40:35] this loose end grabs it ties it back
[40:37] together and makes it back into one
[40:39] Eternal strand of the word of God that's
[40:42] just the way I say it he took every bit
[40:44] of that all those gaps and filled them
[40:46] up
[40:48] why did he fill him up listen God winked
[40:50] at the ignorance of people down to the
[40:51] church ages but when we come into this
[40:53] church age we are a special group of
[40:55] people this group of people's got to get
[40:57] it right
[40:59] because there's not another church age
[41:01] for us to hand it off to and say well we
[41:04] kind of messed it up in this age y'all
[41:08] can take care of it no
[41:10] um
[41:11] we're either staying here or going up
[41:13] one of the two
[41:14] all right
[41:15] so that's our mandate let's get out of
[41:17] here but you got to get out of here with
[41:19] a full word not with part word all right
[41:22] you must be born again brother Robin
[41:24] said look he said you're still what you
[41:26] were until you're actually born again of
[41:27] the spirit of God
[41:29] all these other things doesn't change
[41:30] you
[41:32] the new birth is an experience something
[41:34] that takes place you've got to really
[41:37] look at this like
[41:39] an event and to me it is an event it's
[41:43] like your sisters we said many times
[41:44] before you you had the baby you know
[41:46] when you had a baby all right
[41:49] right
[41:50] so there was an event you had to go to
[41:53] the hospital the doctor had to do this
[41:54] they had to do that this had to be done
[41:56] that had to be done everything had to be
[41:58] set up and then here comes the baby and
[42:01] we understand how that all happens all
[42:03] right so there was an event something
[42:05] went on and something happened and you
[42:07] knew about it well that's the way your
[42:08] new birth is you're supposed to you
[42:10] should not Wonder
[42:13] where you got born again
[42:16] you should
[42:17] now you're gonna listen in your mind
[42:19] Satan right now those he's plugging he's
[42:21] saying no you really don't know you
[42:23] really don't need that you really this
[42:25] is this and this no you got to say look
[42:27] buddy this is it right here
[42:29] this is the point and you know what I
[42:32] can tell the same I was reading
[42:34] something the other day and somebody
[42:35] made a profound statement if you tell
[42:38] the truth the first time you don't have
[42:40] to remember what to lie about the next
[42:42] time
[42:44] right
[42:45] if you tell the truth if you start with
[42:48] a lie
[42:49] you got to remember what that lie was
[42:53] and tell it the same way 50 different
[42:55] times that's why I don't want to tell
[42:57] these people about the message they say
[42:58] brother around this brother I'm left
[43:00] he kept his story straight the whole
[43:03] time
[43:05] the whole time his whole life
[43:09] he didn't stop one day and say oh man
[43:11] that really didn't happen
[43:13] happened
[43:16] I live
[43:18] I live be married to June because I was
[43:21] there
[43:22] so I can tell you about it you know what
[43:24] don't have to lie about it either
[43:26] don't have to fabricate what went on
[43:29] I was there
[43:31] so the day you got born again you better
[43:33] have been there
[43:35] because it was for you
[43:38] he said well I believe brother Aaron got
[43:40] it because you know he did this and that
[43:41] and the other no the only person who
[43:42] knows God is him
[43:44] because it's that individual what
[43:46] individual personal relationship with
[43:49] God our brother Brian said what Jesus
[43:52] Christ personally
[43:53] he's going to come personally into you
[43:55] and he's going to say you are my child I
[43:58] am pleased to dwell in you let's get
[44:01] this thing started
[44:03] been waiting on you all your life
[44:05] you know what God said I've been waiting
[44:07] on you all my life too
[44:10] hey
[44:11] if you're anything if you're an eternal
[44:13] part of God that's what he's been
[44:14] waiting on the whole time he's had you
[44:15] in his mind the whole time
[44:18] never not thought of you never never was
[44:20] a time when he said
[44:21] how'd you get here
[44:23] no he knew where you'd be
[44:27] he knew how you get here and then you
[44:29] how you get him
[44:32] but you shall receive power after
[44:35] see the the church the first church that
[44:37] first church in Ephesus brother Brian
[44:39] said it was a powerful Church 12 people
[44:42] but they were powerful because they all
[44:44] had the Holy Ghost
[44:46] not to say they didn't have issues
[44:48] but they all had the Holy Ghost they all
[44:51] had things coming they all were in one
[44:54] mind and one Accord they they were they
[44:57] were they they forwarded trying to pick
[45:00] my words they forwarded the gospel
[45:02] in the time that they were supposed to
[45:04] everybody with me because see Jesus had
[45:07] just died went off the scene Pentecost
[45:10] had just happened 80 30. all right then
[45:13] you got Paul coming in and being a
[45:16] church age messenger you got Paul coming
[45:17] in him being the messenger and them
[45:20] accepting Paul's message
[45:24] that you're predestinated that you're
[45:26] adopted that you're that you're um
[45:29] that you're in him you know found in him
[45:32] before the foundation of the world
[45:33] Christ in you the hope of glory there
[45:35] was Paul that was the message of the day
[45:37] and they accepted that message and they
[45:39] were a great powerful church because the
[45:40] Holy Ghost worked in every one of them
[45:44] pray for that
[45:46] pray for that to happen in this church
[45:48] and I do for every person to receive the
[45:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:53] man if you don't then you know I'm sorry
[45:55] we got to make it available for
[45:57] everybody
[46:01] but you shall receive power after that's
[46:03] why the the 12
[46:06] Ephesian church members and Power
[46:09] they receive power after
[46:11] the Holy Ghost Came Upon them
[46:13] and I say the the group that Paul met
[46:16] that have you received the Holy Ghost
[46:18] since you believed I believe they became
[46:20] a powerful church after they all
[46:21] received the Holy Ghost all right that
[46:23] was why Cornelius was Cornelius
[46:25] in Acts 19 we've been reading it
[46:29] but you know they didn't even know if
[46:30] that there was anything about the Holy
[46:32] Ghost they were preaching the power of
[46:33] the word just by word
[46:35] right
[46:37] right and by baptism right John's
[46:40] baptism Paul comes in and Paul said
[46:42] that's okay
[46:44] but
[46:46] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[46:48] you believed
[46:49] they said we don't know anything about
[46:51] the Holy Ghost In other words we have
[46:52] been taught
[46:53] and Paul said give me a minute
[46:56] let me talk to you about this holy ghost
[46:58] that I got and so what happened to them
[47:00] they got hands laid on they all got the
[47:01] Holy Ghost spoke in tongues
[47:04] powerful group of people I would say
[47:07] but we were talking this morning about
[47:09] the reason listen the Reason God gives
[47:12] Satan this permitted power I didn't
[47:14] cover this this morning it's because of
[47:16] Joel
[47:17] 2.
[47:19] the church had to go underground the
[47:22] church had to accept false Doctrine for
[47:25] him to birth a church
[47:29] come on for him to birth a bride tree
[47:34] that was more powerful than the other
[47:37] one
[47:40] if you don't understand that let me
[47:42] explain it to you the church was
[47:43] powerful in the first three Church ages
[47:45] then all that got eat chopped down every
[47:47] how you want to talk about diluted right
[47:50] it got watered down not by the watering
[47:52] of the word but by the watering of the
[47:54] devil it got watered down so diluted
[47:56] made what lukewarm cold and Powerless
[47:59] but it was still a church
[48:03] God gave Satan the power to do that
[48:06] because he knew listen he knew there'd
[48:08] be a group of people that wouldn't that
[48:10] would fall for this
[48:12] so he gave them an opportunity he gave
[48:13] him a choice
[48:15] amen pretty simple
[48:18] right you said no he's a respective
[48:19] persons no he's not because there was a
[48:21] group of people that stood right here in
[48:24] the face of this power and withstood it
[48:27] amen and grew that bright tree grew back
[48:30] up under the power of What Not the power
[48:32] of the man power of the people power the
[48:35] Holy Ghost
[48:36] the Holy Ghost got brought back into the
[48:38] church instead of being lukewarm cold
[48:39] and Powerless they brought the Holy
[48:41] Ghost back into the church
[48:43] so here's permitted power and it went
[48:46] out of talking about the red horse White
[48:47] Horse and all those the power was given
[48:49] to him
[48:50] to do these different things
[48:52] permitted power
[48:54] brother Brown tells us how the
[48:56] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[48:57] church defile it making it lukewarm
[49:00] formal and Powerless all right that's
[49:04] what it did but now watch he's going to
[49:07] restore according to Joel 2 and even
[49:10] Jesus stood one day and he said look
[49:12] I can't do you any good standing here
[49:15] today
[49:17] I can't do you any good unless this
[49:20] court of wheat
[49:22] falls into the ground and dies
[49:25] it abides alone because I have you and
[49:28] me
[49:30] and I can't get you out unless I die
[49:34] so this corn of wheat's gonna die it's
[49:37] gonna fall in the ground die
[49:40] brother Brown said that body laid cold
[49:43] dead in a grave
[49:45] he said the word
[49:47] lay dead cold in the grave
[49:50] her body was laying there dead now the
[49:53] inside guy was working
[49:55] he didn't hit
[49:56] [Music]
[49:59] it remember he comes back because I will
[50:02] restore
[50:04] well now when he when he was when Jesus
[50:06] was restored now remember Jesus
[50:08] pre-crucifixion didn't have a glorified
[50:11] body
[50:13] he didn't know all things
[50:17] are we good there it didn't know all
[50:19] things there's a lot of things he did
[50:20] not know
[50:23] so he had to go into the ground
[50:26] die to fulfill Joel and all the other
[50:30] scriptures and what he stood one day and
[50:31] said this corner wheat's got to fall on
[50:33] the ground
[50:34] and die but when it comes back up
[50:38] there'll not just be one seed
[50:41] there'll be many seeds
[50:46] till we were inside of him
[50:48] captured inside of a body
[50:51] a body of Flesh
[50:52] that groaned and moaned that had to eat
[50:55] that had to go through good days and bad
[50:57] days that had to watch where he stepped
[51:00] and watch what he did and what
[51:04] but now when he come back up
[51:07] in a glorified body
[51:09] all that had been left
[51:12] and he come out what
[51:15] now all Heaven and Earth everything
[51:17] everything's in my power now I've got
[51:19] what I'm supposed to get I've fulfilled
[51:21] all scripture except for one
[51:26] I got to get back in my bride
[51:29] I'll come back that's the comforter
[51:32] give you the Holy Ghost I read John 16.
[51:35] he's going to give you power
[51:38] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[51:42] wasn't just an anointing it was an
[51:44] indwelling he could not indwell us
[51:45] inside of one human body
[51:49] with me
[51:51] inside of one human body he was caught
[51:54] but he was caught as the prophet of God
[51:56] I love what he said for the purpose of
[51:59] death
[52:00] was he put in that human body
[52:03] but it wasn't the purpose of him dying
[52:05] just to die and go away the purpose was
[52:08] for him to die to release me and you
[52:12] praise the Lord to release us
[52:16] he released the life
[52:19] so let that seed wouldn't have to go
[52:21] back now we know and type through the
[52:23] church ages in the fourth Church age
[52:25] brother Ram Thompson as the seed going
[52:28] into the ground again
[52:30] almost dying
[52:32] but coming back out but the the very
[52:35] whole scripture was on what Jesus was
[52:36] doing folks
[52:38] it depended on Jesus to go in the ground
[52:41] it depended on Jesus to die
[52:43] it depended on that seed to rot in the
[52:46] ground now we know his body didn't rot
[52:47] we know that but it's dead
[52:50] there was no life in it it was cold
[52:54] praise God it didn't corrupt
[52:58] when he picked that thing up he said hey
[53:00] all power and heaven and Earth's been
[53:01] given unto me now
[53:02] I'm ready
[53:04] I'm ready I got one more thing to do he
[53:06] said go Terry
[53:08] they start saying now aren't you going
[53:10] aren't you gonna whip these Romans
[53:12] I thought you'd come and set up a
[53:13] kingdom
[53:15] he's like
[53:16] go to Jerusalem
[53:20] I've talked y'all for three and a half
[53:21] years you ain't learned nothing
[53:24] they did pack it in though
[53:27] Jerusalem you'll be a doable power from
[53:30] online 11 days from now just just go
[53:33] let's go on over there
[53:34] because when they did watch the first
[53:36] thing Paul Peter said he said this is
[53:39] that
[53:41] this is that he goes back in the Old
[53:43] Testament says this is it
[53:46] well I believe the prophet gave us a
[53:48] message and this is it
[53:50] we are going to leave this place
[53:53] not as a defeated bride but as a bride
[53:56] that has already put on her garments
[53:58] right here
[54:03] sure there'll be rewards there'll be
[54:05] crowns there'll be all kind of different
[54:07] things when we get there
[54:10] but you get your white robe right here
[54:13] the cleanness and the righteousness of
[54:15] the Saints is right here it's not over
[54:17] there it's right here all right
[54:19] when you got born again you put on that
[54:22] robe of righteousness all right we'll
[54:25] talk about that in just a second if
[54:26] you'll give me a little give me a little
[54:27] time
[54:29] same crept in
[54:34] the real preaching
[54:38] and when they were blinded it wasn't
[54:39] long until the Church of Rome stopped
[54:42] baptizing in the name of Lord Jesus and
[54:43] all the other things that they stopped
[54:45] doing
[54:46] now watch her I told you I was going to
[54:47] read this Revelation 2 Verse 6 is but
[54:49] this thou Hast that that thou hatest
[54:53] look that thou hate us he's talking
[54:55] about the church age y'all hate them and
[54:57] I hate them too
[54:59] but it was then it was a deed
[55:03] it was talked about
[55:06] well what do you think of my old brother
[55:08] so-and-so he
[55:09] he's what do you think about this
[55:11] cyrenius guy he's saying that Jesus
[55:13] wasn't really God he was just a kind of
[55:16] a peace or a part and and then he become
[55:19] the fullness and you know he starts
[55:21] preaching all his false doctrines well
[55:22] yeah that was there
[55:24] which was a deed but watch that deed
[55:26] finally turned into listen serencius
[55:28] must have got a Pulpit
[55:32] and he kept preaching that and preaching
[55:34] it and preaching it until somebody
[55:36] believed it
[55:38] because that word hate in the Bible
[55:41] means detest so God just detested he
[55:43] don't even want to know where around
[55:45] Revelation 2 14 which is in continuation
[55:48] of the church ages this is another
[55:51] church age but I have a few things
[55:52] against you because thou Hast them that
[55:55] hold the doctrine of Balaam who taught
[55:59] balak to cast a stumbling block before
[56:01] the children of Israel to eat things
[56:03] sacrificed into Idols commit fornication
[56:05] so hast thou also them that hold the
[56:08] doctrine
[56:10] now it's not just a d it's not just
[56:12] somebody having a little
[56:15] having a little corner session
[56:17] I don't know about this preacher I don't
[56:19] know if he's telling the truth this may
[56:20] I think I see it this way
[56:23] hmm
[56:24] no when it becomes a Doctrine that's
[56:26] when you preach it behind the pulpit
[56:28] brother Ryan said every church has to
[56:30] have a what a Doctrine or you're not
[56:32] even a church so we have a Doctrine the
[56:34] fullness of the word that's our Doctrine
[56:36] uh adoption is our Doctrine
[56:39] um growth is our is our doctrine that we
[56:42] preach here in this church all right and
[56:43] I believe it's the truth so ask thou
[56:45] also them that hold the doctrine of the
[56:48] Nicolaitans which thing I hate
[56:54] repent so you do have a way to get out
[56:57] repent or else I will come unto you
[56:59] quickly now watch and we'll fight
[57:01] against them with the
[57:04] sword
[57:06] what
[57:07] he's going to put
[57:09] somebody that'll yield their self as
[57:11] brother Dale different ones he'll put
[57:13] somebody in a Pulpit that will yield to
[57:15] him and he'll give them the word or the
[57:17] sword of the truth and whack that thing
[57:20] out
[57:21] master surgeon cut that thing out
[57:25] praise God
[57:28] it's a Pulpit is where it started no
[57:30] wonder that's the damnation of this
[57:31] country when Satan got into Pulpit it's
[57:33] the truth failing to preach the
[57:35] unadulterated word of God and the word
[57:37] of God will produce just exactly what it
[57:40] said it would do but we explain it all
[57:42] away
[57:44] oh you know we
[57:45] and and I'll read you here in just a
[57:47] minute where brother mom talks about
[57:48] being timid oh we don't have to have
[57:50] church order
[57:52] really
[57:53] oh we're above that
[57:55] we're just led by the spirit of God yeah
[57:57] you led by spirit all right
[58:00] it's not of God
[58:02] because listen God has never been out of
[58:05] order God has never been dysfunctional
[58:08] God has never been where everything was
[58:12] not in order now we have
[58:14] but he hasn't so why don't we just yield
[58:17] to the guy that knows everything that
[58:18] never does anything wrong
[58:20] all right no we decided to go over here
[58:22] to this other guy because he makes it
[58:24] all tantalizing and happy and and you
[58:26] know fireworks and and beautiful colors
[58:28] and the Lord's just over here going just
[58:31] do what I
[58:32] just just do what I ask God ain't no
[58:35] flowers I ain't got a flower or nothing
[58:37] ain't nothing here I don't have to give
[58:38] you
[58:39] pews which we do I don't have to give
[58:41] you all this stuff just believe what I
[58:43] said
[58:45] but when Satan got a hold of it in other
[58:47] words he broke through the walls he
[58:48] marred the Masterpiece talking myself in
[58:51] the Garden of Eden we know what happened
[58:53] but remember I thank God there was a
[58:55] there was a God that could do something
[58:57] there
[58:58] there was somebody that was standing
[59:00] there in his person not somebody
[59:03] floating around he was standing there
[59:05] talking to Adam and Eve he said look I
[59:07] know what you've done
[59:08] I knew you were gonna do it
[59:11] and there's going to be a division but
[59:13] I'm going to put that division back
[59:15] together
[59:16] I'm gonna come myself I'm not gonna
[59:19] listen I'm not gonna trust Abraham
[59:26] I I'm not going to trust Adam
[59:29] was going to the Earth
[59:31] but he couldn't save you
[59:33] I've got to come back I'm the Savior I
[59:36] can save you what's inside of me comes
[59:39] inside of you it will save you
[59:43] if Adam could have done that you'd just
[59:45] acted like Adam
[59:50] that's why we act like the world when we
[59:52] have the world inside of us and we act
[59:53] like God when we got God inside of us
[59:55] it's just pretty simple
[59:57] he is God he will not be defeated so he
[1:00:00] went to work immediately to build his
[1:00:02] own image a man
[1:00:09] we'll skip that
[1:00:10] we read that this morning but I like
[1:00:13] this one right here look how can any
[1:00:14] messenger sent from God believe only a
[1:00:16] part of the word and deny some of it
[1:00:18] a true prophet of God in this last day
[1:00:20] will proclaim the true problem the whole
[1:00:23] word denominations will hate him well
[1:00:25] there's a marker because they hated him
[1:00:27] they still hate him
[1:00:31] his words may be as harsh as John the
[1:00:33] Baptist who called him vipers but the
[1:00:34] predestinator will hear him be ready for
[1:00:37] the rapture
[1:00:40] and somebody was preaching not to I
[1:00:42] think it was brother Noel Johnson was
[1:00:43] you know there's a word that that
[1:00:45] there's a thunder there's word there's
[1:00:47] all kind of scenes going on in Paul's
[1:00:49] time and we talk about hearing just a
[1:00:51] minute about when the adoption of Jesus
[1:00:53] when he went upon the mountain that was
[1:00:55] this voice that said this is my beloved
[1:00:56] Son and that it confused all them that
[1:00:59] were sitting there
[1:01:01] first name Peter says is Let's Make A
[1:01:03] transitarian Doctrine out of it right
[1:01:05] let's make three Tabernacles
[1:01:09] you know what God said shut up
[1:01:12] because remember the next thing they saw
[1:01:14] was Jesus himself one person Jesus only
[1:01:18] all right
[1:01:22] first seal
[1:01:24] when that seal opened
[1:01:26] are beginning to open listen it already
[1:01:27] been open to the Bro to the to the
[1:01:29] prophet before he preached it obviously
[1:01:31] all right he got the Revelation that day
[1:01:33] and was preaching it to the people he
[1:01:35] said now I'm going to call you bride in
[1:01:37] other words I'm going to separate he
[1:01:38] said I know where that why horse rider
[1:01:40] is what his power is and where he's at
[1:01:42] he's in the church
[1:01:45] he's in the people
[1:01:47] but we've got to see him right away
[1:01:51] go away from us
[1:01:55] I'm going to call you bride that you'll
[1:01:57] understand
[1:01:58] the prophet tells us is we have Satan's
[1:02:00] answer
[1:02:01] we need to realize that we have Satan's
[1:02:03] answer you know what he's hid he can
[1:02:06] hide in false Doctrine
[1:02:09] he can hide in unbelief
[1:02:12] but he cannot hide in the perfect word
[1:02:14] of God
[1:02:16] and he cannot hide in full faith
[1:02:20] brother Ram says hallelujah the headship
[1:02:22] is here Christ the Risen Lord is hearing
[1:02:25] the same power now look the same power
[1:02:28] as on the day of his resurrection
[1:02:32] that he ever was manifesting himself
[1:02:34] there's the devil's answer and that was
[1:02:36] I think about this but
[1:02:38] you know you take Paul Paul was a great
[1:02:41] warrior
[1:02:43] but remember when when you write when
[1:02:45] Jesus was writing I say Jesus it was
[1:02:48] Jesus it was on the Isle of Patmos
[1:02:50] telling John about his church ages he
[1:02:52] said you've lost your first love
[1:02:54] something's crept in after Paul has
[1:02:57] preached his heart out
[1:02:59] remember the messenger comes at the end
[1:03:00] of the age Paul came at the end of
[1:03:02] Pentecost and brought his message he
[1:03:04] wasn't there the full time that church
[1:03:05] age was going on
[1:03:08] don't get silent on me
[1:03:10] right Master comes at the end of the
[1:03:12] church age Paul didn't come at the end
[1:03:14] of the first church age
[1:03:15] and they came at the end of Pentecost
[1:03:18] all right then he brings his message
[1:03:22] and then somebody else gets a thought
[1:03:25] from somebody beside God
[1:03:28] and he may say what lukewarm cold and
[1:03:31] Powerless
[1:03:32] but yet it's still in the church age
[1:03:35] so and Satan said
[1:03:38] I got a bunch of them
[1:03:40] second Church age Arenas and then you
[1:03:42] got serenthius and different ones boy
[1:03:43] then the Third Church age and the fourth
[1:03:45] Church age he was just having a blast
[1:03:47] when they went to nicaea and he started
[1:03:49] just diluting the word of God and making
[1:03:51] the change made the word of God change
[1:03:54] that now Jesus is a light substance of
[1:03:56] God so he must be the second person of a
[1:03:58] trinity now we're going to come up with
[1:04:00] this word Trinity
[1:04:02] baptize Jesus name anymore we don't want
[1:04:05] that
[1:04:06] Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost so
[1:04:09] that's what we're going to tell you
[1:04:11] Satan's over here going out boy
[1:04:14] and God's going
[1:04:16] I knew this was going to happen
[1:04:19] but I got to let it happen
[1:04:21] I gotta let it happen
[1:04:23] so it's a true word will show itself and
[1:04:26] make itself known
[1:04:28] amen
[1:04:29] but now look he has a formidable
[1:04:32] opponent
[1:04:34] and it's a woman
[1:04:43] Mr Brad
[1:04:45] his opponent now is the bride
[1:04:48] but see Satan just don't believe that
[1:04:50] God has already told us back there in
[1:04:52] John 16 I'm going to put myself in you
[1:04:55] and I ain't gonna talk about me no more
[1:04:57] we're going to talk about her
[1:05:00] listen he defeated Satan at Calvary
[1:05:04] who's going to fulfill that
[1:05:08] right here
[1:05:09] everybody raise your hand and go right
[1:05:11] here
[1:05:12] right here this is where he's gonna be
[1:05:14] defeated sure he was defeated at Calvary
[1:05:17] but guess what
[1:05:19] people died
[1:05:21] by the Millions
[1:05:23] since he died on the cross to destroy
[1:05:26] death
[1:05:27] now he destroyed death at Calvary right
[1:05:29] and proved it brother Brown said by
[1:05:31] Resurrection three days later
[1:05:34] what's our problem
[1:05:38] our conquerors already conquered it all
[1:05:41] but Satan jumps right back in and starts
[1:05:43] pouring his poison in it
[1:05:46] all you really think he gonna be able to
[1:05:48] do that
[1:05:51] why did Jesus tell us to baptize Him
[1:05:53] Father Son Holy Ghost I'll take what
[1:05:55] Jesus said
[1:05:56] so why
[1:05:59] he said baptized in a name not a title
[1:06:04] but you know what Satan Satan listen
[1:06:06] Satan hid in the ignorance of the church
[1:06:13] because listen Luther was a trinitarian
[1:06:15] Luther baptized in the name of father
[1:06:17] son Holy Ghost they didn't have that
[1:06:19] great Revelation but God went to the
[1:06:21] ignorance of them because they weren't a
[1:06:23] foreign formidable opponent they didn't
[1:06:25] have to destroy death
[1:06:28] this bride has to end their body
[1:06:34] in your flesh
[1:06:37] death has to be destroyed
[1:06:39] Body Spirit and soul not just not just
[1:06:42] Soul he's already destroyed and soul
[1:06:44] that's one thing to say he can't
[1:06:46] understand when you get born again he
[1:06:47] cannot understand your soul anymore
[1:06:50] he understood it the first time though
[1:06:51] because he was a resident of it
[1:06:54] but once you throw that Resident out and
[1:06:56] you seal that thing in
[1:06:58] put that seal on it
[1:07:01] if he touches it brother Brown said like
[1:07:03] 10 million volts
[1:07:05] where he used to just walk in and go in
[1:07:07] and out your soul all he wanted to hey
[1:07:09] how you doing I love you
[1:07:12] well I love you too have another drink
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:18] right but now
[1:07:20] oh let me in no
[1:07:24] I'll give you a no
[1:07:27] I have your answer
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:38] but we have his answer and listen it's
[1:07:40] not just it's not just a comedy we laugh
[1:07:43] isn't it but it's not a comedy we are
[1:07:45] his formidable opponent
[1:07:48] listen
[1:07:49] that dude has been around almost as long
[1:07:51] as God has
[1:07:52] I said almost
[1:07:54] so he's learned God's tactics
[1:07:57] and then hear us weak Americans or
[1:08:00] whatever you want to say uh humans
[1:08:04] here we come on Earth and Satan's like
[1:08:06] oh man I got this a bunch of softies he
[1:08:09] said I can play with their emotion I can
[1:08:11] get in their mind and I can play and he
[1:08:14] did it all down through the church all
[1:08:15] down through the church ages in the new
[1:08:17] in the Old Testament he played all down
[1:08:19] through here but he come down to where
[1:08:21] he found one guy
[1:08:22] and when that guy was born he said man I
[1:08:24] don't know how to deal with this guy
[1:08:27] I can't get in the soul
[1:08:29] I you know I'm bother him but
[1:08:32] he just don't ever give in
[1:08:35] he's just different
[1:08:37] I hope they say that about you
[1:08:41] the devils are like
[1:08:48] go ahead have a fifth
[1:08:51] but have it somewhere else
[1:08:53] amen right right he can be spazzled all
[1:08:56] he wants to but he can pass somewhere
[1:08:57] else
[1:08:58] he's not spazzing on me or you anymore
[1:09:00] if you're born again right
[1:09:05] that's why I listen folks we have
[1:09:06] Satan's answer because we are formidable
[1:09:09] opponent that means we have Satan's
[1:09:11] answers brother Brown said we have his
[1:09:12] answer whatever thing he talks to us
[1:09:15] about we should have an answer back
[1:09:17] because listen we're not to be deceived
[1:09:20] others were deceived other Church Ages
[1:09:23] were even deceived sorry to say that
[1:09:24] Luther was deceived into believing that
[1:09:27] father son Holy Ghost was a great
[1:09:28] baptism
[1:09:30] but not when you come to the end time
[1:09:31] where a prophet has to restore the word
[1:09:34] back to the first church aides Plus
[1:09:41] listen we should be in the Plus
[1:09:44] [Music]
[1:09:46] we should be in the plus Paul had a
[1:09:49] group that thought he thought they were
[1:09:51] in the plush and he started preaching to
[1:09:53] him and he said hold on a minute y'all
[1:09:55] still babies
[1:09:58] I'll read it to you in just a minute
[1:09:59] Desiring the censor of milk of the word
[1:10:01] that's okay desire it they at least they
[1:10:04] desire the word
[1:10:05] but they wanted milk
[1:10:08] but the formidable opponent is Jesus
[1:10:11] Christ in you in his fullness
[1:10:14] because remember
[1:10:16] the Son of God down through the church
[1:10:17] ages Satan could reside close by
[1:10:21] he could deceive
[1:10:23] he could make you you know think you're
[1:10:25] right and you're not
[1:10:27] but now they want a day when the Lord
[1:10:30] Jesus the son of man was walking to
[1:10:31] Earth and he said
[1:10:34] I think that God may be right
[1:10:37] talk about the devil
[1:10:39] you know he told me he'd give me the
[1:10:40] whole world
[1:10:42] he told me if I fail that that the
[1:10:45] Angels would would pick me up
[1:10:49] right
[1:10:50] right I went out he told me that that if
[1:10:53] I was hungry I had the power
[1:10:56] no Jesus was sitting there the whole
[1:10:58] time going when you're finished
[1:11:02] when you're finished you're fixing to
[1:11:03] see
[1:11:04] I'm different
[1:11:06] I don't play
[1:11:09] I'm your formidable opponent
[1:11:12] and now where is that formidable
[1:11:14] opponent that walked in Jesus Christ
[1:11:16] it's in me and you
[1:11:18] by the new birth and it is fullness not
[1:11:21] just in part
[1:11:24] it's been churches churches Brides
[1:11:26] churches Brides brides but thank God
[1:11:28] there's got to come one and that's us in
[1:11:31] the end time one
[1:11:33] there's not a Baptist bride anymore they
[1:11:35] used to be
[1:11:38] they used to be a mess of the Sprite
[1:11:41] there used to be a Pentecostal bride
[1:11:44] come on
[1:11:45] yes sir they did if they got the baptism
[1:11:47] of the Holy Ghost under their age
[1:11:50] they're just as Eternal As You Are
[1:11:52] right and their bride
[1:11:54] get by with me
[1:11:56] but brother Brown he said they've got to
[1:11:58] come one
[1:12:00] God don't have a Baptist Pride anymore
[1:12:04] listen they left him
[1:12:07] the Methodist bride left their lover
[1:12:09] they left their husband and went after
[1:12:12] what cruise and dogmas the devil
[1:12:14] right they don't have Satan's answer
[1:12:21] they don't have Satan's answer
[1:12:24] but you and I do
[1:12:27] there has to come a real bride there
[1:12:29] must come one that's not only got the
[1:12:31] mechanics but the Dynamics of it making
[1:12:34] that church live moving the power of his
[1:12:37] resurrection until we come to that place
[1:12:39] until we find that place what good does
[1:12:41] it do to just polish the hubs
[1:12:45] we stopped here this morning the token
[1:12:46] the blood the Covenant blood is not
[1:12:48] recognized without the token the word
[1:12:50] assures us of that promise the token is
[1:12:53] the sign the purchase has been made for
[1:12:55] us
[1:12:56] full obedience to the full word of God
[1:12:58] entitles us to that token all right the
[1:13:02] fullness of that token not just that
[1:13:04] nobody had to talk until the end time
[1:13:06] now there is a quote where he said that
[1:13:07] but you know he's not saying that that
[1:13:09] there was no new birth
[1:13:11] I just told you there have been
[1:13:12] Methodist bride there was Pentecostal
[1:13:14] bride and when I say bride that means
[1:13:16] holy ghost in the soul
[1:13:17] that means a new birth
[1:13:19] bride and New Birth go together
[1:13:21] all right foolish version and foolish
[1:13:24] version and New Birth don't go together
[1:13:27] right
[1:13:28] so there's a difference
[1:13:31] anointing does not go with us
[1:13:35] we have indwelling
[1:13:38] right
[1:13:40] no the other way is there that you could
[1:13:42] ever be entitled to the Token until you
[1:13:44] fully obey the word not what somebody
[1:13:47] has put into it and added to it but what
[1:13:49] God
[1:13:51] said about it Ephesians 4 verse 29
[1:13:54] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:13:57] of your mouth but that which is good to
[1:13:59] the use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:14:00] Grace Into the hearer Now look and
[1:14:02] grieve not the holy spirit of God now
[1:14:03] how you grieve him go back up to verse
[1:14:05] 29.
[1:14:07] the corrupt communication proceeding out
[1:14:09] of your mouth
[1:14:12] will grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:14:15] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:14:18] your Redemption of the of redemption let
[1:14:20] all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:14:22] clamor evil speaking be put away from me
[1:14:24] that sounds like the statue of perfect
[1:14:26] man to me doesn't it to you
[1:14:28] and be kind one to another oh that's a
[1:14:30] big brother of the kindness
[1:14:31] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:14:34] as God for Christ's sake
[1:14:36] has forgiven you possession the enemy's
[1:14:38] Gates 1959 the holy spirit is so timid
[1:14:42] that's why there's Church order
[1:14:45] that's why there's order of a service
[1:14:46] that's why we don't let the kids run
[1:14:48] around in the in the
[1:14:50] out here and and and you know for those
[1:14:52] of you that don't know it brother Dale
[1:14:54] set this up long time ago that between
[1:14:56] Services we do have a short period of
[1:14:58] time but if you want to practice your
[1:14:59] songs you've got to 130 to practice
[1:15:01] right sister Esther you've got to one at
[1:15:03] 1 30. I don't care you cut it off you be
[1:15:05] quiet service music turns on brother
[1:15:07] random comes on and you sit down there's
[1:15:10] no and I don't mind you talking around
[1:15:12] during that time because you have to
[1:15:13] have well what key is that or what verse
[1:15:16] you want to sing that's fine
[1:15:18] all right but when 1 30 comes
[1:15:21] that's a designated time that we're
[1:15:23] going to pray and run this and run the
[1:15:26] sound or the singing and then start
[1:15:29] settling down
[1:15:30] so see that's order
[1:15:32] what if one brought down so I am you
[1:15:34] know
[1:15:36] got practice right till two o'clock
[1:15:37] that's okay don't worry about it
[1:15:41] well it's not right
[1:15:43] not according to what the prophet said
[1:15:45] so there's an order and the Holy Spirit
[1:15:47] is timid because of that order
[1:15:49] how many knows that just real timing the
[1:15:51] Holy Spirit just a little Interruption
[1:15:52] bothers him
[1:15:54] remember he would say he'll say hey sit
[1:15:56] down
[1:15:58] all them Pentecostals you know they were
[1:15:59] sitting there going
[1:16:00] I want to run
[1:16:02] I want to jump
[1:16:04] I want Shout
[1:16:06] and a lot of them did get up and speak
[1:16:07] in tongues and he allowed it for a while
[1:16:09] and he finally he said hey shut up
[1:16:11] and what about a man in a Pentecostal
[1:16:15] Congregation of a few thousand and they
[1:16:18] build everything on that speaking in
[1:16:21] tongues
[1:16:22] that woman jumps up starts speaking in
[1:16:24] tongues he said shut down and shut up
[1:16:26] oh my word
[1:16:28] well you know there's a bunch of
[1:16:29] Pentecostals didn't ask him back no more
[1:16:31] I promise you that
[1:16:34] but he said you're out of order
[1:16:36] there's an order
[1:16:38] Church order and Doctrine there's a
[1:16:39] whole big book of it in there a couple
[1:16:41] of tapes
[1:16:43] so let's continue on but that's why
[1:16:45] there is order it's because the Holy
[1:16:46] Ghost is timid and you know what else
[1:16:48] too now watch
[1:16:50] the Holy Ghost is pleased with the word
[1:16:53] of God being brought
[1:16:55] in his time and season
[1:16:58] but he's not if there's not
[1:17:02] the Holy Spirit cannot stand if listen
[1:17:05] if Jesus in the Holy Ghost and the
[1:17:08] father of the same person
[1:17:11] when we go to Revelations 14 I mean
[1:17:14] Revelation is 2 14 where he says I hate
[1:17:17] that doctrine of the Nicolaitans that's
[1:17:21] the Holy Ghost talking
[1:17:23] that may be Jesus but it's the Holy
[1:17:25] Ghost talking now Jesus is not standing
[1:17:28] here today in flesh he has sent back to
[1:17:30] what
[1:17:31] let's have some participation sit back
[1:17:34] to what
[1:17:35] oh so he sent back the Holy Ghost
[1:17:39] and he's very timid
[1:17:43] so he ain't gonna put up with false
[1:17:45] Doctrine
[1:17:47] that's why brother Brown said if you're
[1:17:49] a preacher if your pastor is preaching
[1:17:50] false Doctrine do what he say do he said
[1:17:52] that's the only reason you can leave
[1:17:55] go to the brother talk to him if you
[1:17:57] want to but that's the only reason you
[1:17:59] can leave not just code brother Aaron
[1:18:00] can't sing
[1:18:04] Our Sister Sarah can't play the organ
[1:18:05] here I get the whole family
[1:18:07] or Levi can't run the sound board back
[1:18:09] in I mean the video board back there
[1:18:16] you can't
[1:18:18] you leave because the word because if
[1:18:20] the Holy Ghost is timid and you're
[1:18:21] sitting there listening to false
[1:18:22] Doctrine if you got the Holy Ghost we've
[1:18:24] been through this many times before how
[1:18:26] many times have you sat in the
[1:18:27] congregation somebody preached fault
[1:18:28] Doctrine
[1:18:29] as a little bell goes off something goes
[1:18:31] hey hey hey hey hey hey
[1:18:33] what that's the Holy Ghost in you that
[1:18:36] timid God that said hey I hate that
[1:18:40] get away from it
[1:18:42] don't you amen that
[1:18:47] God's Not Gonna Hate manifold Doctrine
[1:18:49] I'll promise you that
[1:18:54] that's a little point
[1:18:56] so now in a church ages just for a
[1:18:58] second then we'll then we'll punch what
[1:19:00] we're wanting to punch here the Bright
[1:19:02] Tree was eat your stomp now we've
[1:19:03] covered all that we've covered the the
[1:19:05] the the the bride went into the ground
[1:19:08] and all the different things the seed
[1:19:09] goes in the ground it dies it bites
[1:19:11] alone but when it comes up it brings
[1:19:13] forth much fruit that's pretty much your
[1:19:15] bride tree that was eat down and Joel
[1:19:18] said I will restore all those years that
[1:19:21] it was eat well now listen
[1:19:24] when you came to this earth
[1:19:26] in your human body in your Humanity
[1:19:30] you were pretty much eat
[1:19:34] you were dying
[1:19:36] alone
[1:19:39] without God
[1:19:40] without hope
[1:19:42] born in sin shaping iniquity especially
[1:19:44] Muslim liar
[1:19:46] hmm
[1:19:48] but one day
[1:19:51] you were Reborn
[1:19:53] your first birth killed you
[1:19:55] your second birth gives you life
[1:19:58] your second birth
[1:20:00] look where it says laid by the adult
[1:20:04] Heavenly Father
[1:20:07] the caterpillar is the feeding stage we
[1:20:09] went through that metamorphosis just a
[1:20:10] little bit ago but that caterpillar was
[1:20:12] the feeding stage but look that
[1:20:14] caterpillar could do this
[1:20:18] amen but he was eating
[1:20:21] but he could just badly move
[1:20:24] and he looks up and he goes
[1:20:26] man I'd like to be up there
[1:20:29] that's where the good nectar is
[1:20:36] but there's something inside of me
[1:20:39] it's something inside of me that's at
[1:20:41] least pulling me toward that
[1:20:45] and to me that's in the sanctification
[1:20:48] stage because look when I got saying
[1:20:50] when I when I went through
[1:20:51] sanctification that's when all that junk
[1:20:53] left me it wasn't one of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:55] it was when all the junk all the stuff I
[1:20:57] used to do that I love to do I didn't do
[1:20:59] them no more why I was feeding on the
[1:21:02] word of God I was packing in something
[1:21:03] that had not been packed in before
[1:21:06] I was eating good food
[1:21:09] solid food
[1:21:11] there's something inside of me began to
[1:21:14] change
[1:21:16] so the pupa stage is the transition
[1:21:18] stage there's your new birth that's when
[1:21:21] you come forth you're getting ready to
[1:21:22] come forth your cells grow rapidly man
[1:21:25] this thing is good I love it
[1:21:26] everything's all right
[1:21:28] but now remember
[1:21:31] you got to come to an adult stage
[1:21:34] because kids don't have kids
[1:21:37] everybody understand what I'm saying
[1:21:39] children don't beget children
[1:21:42] parents adults beget children
[1:21:47] all right so we come to the adult stage
[1:21:49] which is the reproductive stage what are
[1:21:51] we doing right now we are reproducing
[1:21:53] Jesus Christ and the only way to
[1:21:55] reproduce him is to go through that
[1:21:57] right there
[1:21:58] coach that is him that is that man
[1:22:01] Christ Jesus that we love so much he's
[1:22:03] standing right there like we do have a
[1:22:05] picture somewhere where he's standing
[1:22:07] in that pyramid
[1:22:11] him being the head
[1:22:14] that controls all of it so we're looking
[1:22:16] for a maturity full restoration stage
[1:22:19] where you look like your parents
[1:22:22] where you look like Jesus Christ not
[1:22:24] Leonard and Earthly parents
[1:22:26] Jesus Christ
[1:22:28] each stage is different serves a purpose
[1:22:30] at each stage and we know that for a
[1:22:32] fact justification has a purpose and a
[1:22:35] place sanctification has a purpose and a
[1:22:38] place the new birth and then what then
[1:22:40] the growth development then the opening
[1:22:42] of the word comes and we should we
[1:22:44] should thank God that we're in that part
[1:22:46] that we're not just coming to church
[1:22:49] like brother Andrew said are you are you
[1:22:51] just coming to church because it's
[1:22:53] because it's repetition are you coming
[1:22:55] today to hear something that you've
[1:22:56] never heard before
[1:22:58] here's how I've heard you preach this
[1:22:59] sermon like Michelle steamman said she
[1:23:02] said I've heard Danny preach that 15
[1:23:03] times but you know what it wasn't for
[1:23:06] her
[1:23:08] that was for all them young kids that
[1:23:10] was in there they'd never heard it
[1:23:11] before
[1:23:13] all right all right so let's break this
[1:23:15] down we know what metamorphosis is so
[1:23:16] let's start with a soul just for a few
[1:23:18] minutes see bear with me in just a
[1:23:19] little bit okay when we get to the soul
[1:23:22] this is the this is the real you the
[1:23:25] center of you that is where everything
[1:23:27] emanates as far as you you being a human
[1:23:30] being
[1:23:31] to be a human being you have to have a
[1:23:33] soul
[1:23:34] so brother Graham said the soul is the
[1:23:36] real you
[1:23:38] there's no transmigration of Souls
[1:23:41] let there's no there's no uh as some

[1:24:29] through the statue of a perfect man all
[1:24:31] right
[1:24:33] according as his Divine divine power all
[1:24:36] right divine power
[1:24:38] there's only one person Divine and
[1:24:40] there's only one person with divine
[1:24:42] power
[1:24:44] so that's God
[1:24:45] that's the Holy Ghost that's Jesus
[1:24:47] Christ in spirit form everybody

[1:24:53] us
[1:24:56] all things that pertain as a life and
[1:24:59] godliness in other words our life and
[1:25:00] how to live a Godly life through the
[1:25:03] knowledge now what through we got to go
[1:25:06] through that to understand him through
[1:25:07] the knowledge of him that has called us
[1:25:10] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[1:25:12] unto us
[1:25:13] exceeding great precious promises listen
[1:25:15] just to get the new birth you get a lot
[1:25:17] of promises
[1:25:19] just get the new birth there's so many
[1:25:21] promises eternal life you're my child
[1:25:23] you get to live in the city Hallelujah
[1:25:25] all right there's all kind of promises
[1:25:27] but listen there's some more checks in
[1:25:30] that chatbot
[1:25:33] there's more checks
[1:25:37] we're about giving unto us exceeding
[1:25:38] great and precious promises that by
[1:25:40] these brother Brown said these promises
[1:25:42] you might be what
[1:25:44] partakers
[1:25:46] possessors
[1:25:49] of that divine nature
[1:25:52] that's not the nature of the devil
[1:25:55] that's the divine nature of God we can
[1:25:58] partake of that
[1:26:00] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:26:02] the world through lust to me if you just
[1:26:05] stopped all scripture right there we'd
[1:26:07] be all right
[1:26:08] but that's not our mandate
[1:26:11] that's not all of it but that does get
[1:26:13] you in the Kingdom that does get you
[1:26:15] right here everybody look at me can you
[1:26:18] see that my finger it don't get you
[1:26:19] right here
[1:26:21] that's something one brother said a
[1:26:23] little while ago he said he said he said
[1:26:27] you add faith I said no Faith's not
[1:26:29] allowed
[1:26:31] brother Brown said you're born again at
[1:26:33] Faith
[1:26:34] and then you add
[1:26:37] light went off he'd never been taught
[1:26:38] that before
[1:26:39] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:26:42] the world through lust in other words if
[1:26:44] you're born again today you have escaped
[1:26:46] damnation period
[1:26:48] you might have to go through hell you
[1:26:50] might I mean not that hell but hell on
[1:26:52] Earth you might have to go through a lot
[1:26:54] of things but you're not going to go to
[1:26:56] judgment you're not going to go through
[1:26:57] the tribulation and you're going to get
[1:26:59] to live in that beautiful
[1:27:01] square mile 1500 square mile City
[1:27:04] called the future home
[1:27:06] everybody with me all right so that's
[1:27:08] wonderful for the promises but you know
[1:27:10] what God don't want you to just get
[1:27:11] these and do like I said go sit in the
[1:27:14] chair and close the door and
[1:27:16] I'm a Child of God I made it no you're
[1:27:19] just gonna start it
[1:27:21] just got started
[1:27:24] all right so now
[1:27:26] Romans 8 14 says for as many as are led
[1:27:28] by the spirit of God they are the sons
[1:27:30] of God God calls you answered all right
[1:27:31] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:27:34] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:27:35] received the spirit now remember that is
[1:27:39] not that puts you in line for adoption
[1:27:41] but it doesn't adopt you because your
[1:27:43] adoption is different from your new
[1:27:45] birth
[1:27:46] all right everybody with me listen you
[1:27:49] can be born again and not be adopted
[1:27:53] but you can't be adopted and not be born
[1:27:55] again
[1:27:57] all right everybody with me but you have
[1:27:59] received the spirit of adoption in other
[1:28:01] words what you have lined yourself up in
[1:28:04] the right family
[1:28:07] coach as brother Dale said years ago I
[1:28:10] like everybody quoting him that's good
[1:28:11] but he said he said Satan will not I
[1:28:14] mean God will not
[1:28:16] uh accept or adopt God's children I mean
[1:28:19] Satan's Children
[1:28:20] they're not his
[1:28:22] they're not even in the family
[1:28:24] they kids are different
[1:28:26] and they decided to be that
[1:28:29] all right but you ever see the spirit of
[1:28:32] adoption in the line whereby you cry
[1:28:35] baby
[1:28:36] you cry daddy daddy Abba it's Daddy
[1:28:39] father father the spirit itself now look
[1:28:42] bear with witness with our spirit that
[1:28:45] we are the children of God
[1:28:47] if children then there's what we're in
[1:28:50] the family now
[1:28:52] we get the reading of the well
[1:28:55] and it gives you something
[1:28:57] and join heirs with Christ
[1:29:00] because he's when it didn't bring our
[1:29:03] inheritance he made a way to get us back
[1:29:04] to that inheritance all right joint
[1:29:07] heirs with Christ if so be that what
[1:29:09] that it's just a bell of roses
[1:29:12] and it's party all the time
[1:29:17] can't get ice cream your favorite
[1:29:19] nope if it so be that we watch suffer
[1:29:23] with him
[1:29:25] why is this happening to me don't ever
[1:29:27] ask that if you're a Christian
[1:29:29] don't ever ask that
[1:29:32] say God what's next
[1:29:35] God what's next
[1:29:38] there's something you said you'd never
[1:29:40] leave me or forsake me you said you'd
[1:29:43] never see there's the promises you're in
[1:29:44] the family
[1:29:46] open up hey hey
[1:29:49] open up the well
[1:29:52] the well says
[1:29:54] this is what you get
[1:29:56] [Applause]
[1:29:58] because his will as is
[1:29:59] and we come on Sunday to listen to our
[1:30:03] will being read
[1:30:05] to tell us what we got and what we don't
[1:30:07] got don't you when you have a will you
[1:30:09] write down what you've given your heirs
[1:30:12] right right or not
[1:30:16] for those of you that are a little
[1:30:17] little naughty you're not going to get
[1:30:19] as much
[1:30:20] as children than theirs Heirs of God and
[1:30:24] Joint heirs with Christ or whatever he
[1:30:25] got you got
[1:30:27] all right if so be that we suffer with
[1:30:30] him look that we may be glorified
[1:30:32] together
[1:30:34] all right first Peter 2 verse 1 says
[1:30:36] wherefore laying aside all malice and
[1:30:38] all God you see there's a lot of baggage
[1:30:40] you got to get rid of just to get born
[1:30:42] again
[1:30:44] see we're talking about this this is a
[1:30:47] higher order
[1:30:49] you need to get rid of this when you're
[1:30:50] a Christian
[1:30:51] when you first get started you may fail
[1:30:54] come on you might fail you're gonna fail
[1:30:56] let me put it that way you're gonna fail
[1:31:00] wherefore laying aside all malice Argyle
[1:31:02] hypocrisies envies and evil speaking as
[1:31:05] newborn babes all right babies
[1:31:08] crying I have my father
[1:31:12] desire the sincere milk of the word so
[1:31:15] if you're here today we're going to get
[1:31:17] a little milk
[1:31:18] but we're gonna get a little meat all
[1:31:20] right we serve a seven course meal I
[1:31:23] thought isn't that right
[1:31:25] but you make that you make white grow
[1:31:30] thereby
[1:31:31] if so be
[1:31:34] you have eat
[1:31:37] en you can't taste something unless you
[1:31:39] put it in your mouth
[1:31:41] oh that that's a that's a cheesecake
[1:31:43] right there buddy you like cheesecake
[1:31:47] telling you if y'all ever get hungry
[1:31:49] before church
[1:31:50] go raid Michael's um
[1:31:54] he pays his people to come to Sunday
[1:31:56] school he pays them with cookies and
[1:31:59] crackers and all kind of stuff but if
[1:32:02] you just put just putting it like I was
[1:32:03] telling you before Jim's got this we got
[1:32:05] this Hunter soap which is I mean it
[1:32:07] smells like dirt and and don't look like
[1:32:10] dirt because it's liquid but it smells
[1:32:12] just like dirt so what am I saying I'm
[1:32:13] saying you can be fooled by what you see
[1:32:17] all right
[1:32:18] but when you taste that you'll know real
[1:32:21] quick that ain't Earth that's soap
[1:32:24] right and if it looks like cake
[1:32:27] it may not be cake
[1:32:29] but if you taste of it say man
[1:32:32] that is the best and then whatever what
[1:32:35] it is that you taste your taste buds
[1:32:37] give you that same way with the gospel
[1:32:40] if you have tasted that the Lord is
[1:32:44] gracious
[1:32:45] to whom coming as into a living Stone
[1:32:48] disallowed indeed of men what they hate
[1:32:50] it but chosen of God and precious
[1:32:54] brother Ryan says why I think Pentecost
[1:32:55] fails and when a man is born again the
[1:32:57] spirit of God
[1:32:58] God gives him a checkbook all right now
[1:33:00] we're going to start with this checkbook
[1:33:01] now remember this checkbook is blank all
[1:33:04] but Jesus's name on it and he's going to
[1:33:06] give it to you right here
[1:33:09] all right
[1:33:11] whatever heaven's got
[1:33:13] don't worry
[1:33:15] never go bankrupt
[1:33:17] whatever heaven's got whatever ever
[1:33:19] promises God Jesus has already signed
[1:33:22] his name so he said hey I'm gonna back
[1:33:24] this up
[1:33:25] cause you're a baby though I'm going to
[1:33:27] make sure you don't write it to the
[1:33:29] wrong person or you write it to yourself
[1:33:32] amen
[1:33:35] so I'm gonna make sure that my name's on
[1:33:37] here
[1:33:38] because you got to come to me to see
[1:33:39] what's in there you got to come to my
[1:33:42] will you got to read my will all right
[1:33:44] God gives him a checkbook when you're
[1:33:46] born again of the spirit of God he gives
[1:33:48] you a checkbook that'll last him look
[1:33:50] all through life's journey
[1:33:53] brother wait I've been Christian for 50
[1:33:55] years I ain't another check in that book
[1:33:57] no you ain't wrote enough
[1:34:00] you ain't wrote enough
[1:34:03] and at the bottom of each check has got
[1:34:05] Jesus's name signed to it
[1:34:07] and you just fill it out for any
[1:34:10] Redemptive blessing it's yours already
[1:34:13] paid for
[1:34:14] now surely you're not afraid that it
[1:34:17] won't be cashed
[1:34:18] if you're afraid
[1:34:21] you're just going to hold a book in your
[1:34:22] pocket
[1:34:23] no get it out ride it remember write it
[1:34:26] for big things
[1:34:27] I believe you know you and you and me
[1:34:31] probably have a checkbook with a limit
[1:34:35] or a credit card with the limit sorry
[1:34:36] brother John
[1:34:37] wherever you're at
[1:34:39] there's a limit to this there's no limit
[1:34:43] get riding for 65 billion gazillion
[1:34:46] trillion dollars and God's like
[1:34:48] that all
[1:34:50] that all
[1:34:52] right for big things
[1:34:55] because he has took your soul
[1:34:57] he's burnt out that old nature and he
[1:35:00] now resides and happy to reside in you
[1:35:05] because she's not happy with me he might
[1:35:07] not be happy with you in your spirit
[1:35:09] realm but he's never been a day he's not
[1:35:11] happy with you in your soul
[1:35:14] remember his face or doubt it's not
[1:35:17] faith and doubt
[1:35:19] it's Faith or doubt one's been driven
[1:35:21] out and the other one stays one or the
[1:35:22] other
[1:35:23] everybody with me so I said if you'll
[1:35:25] realize your soul brother Howe his soul
[1:35:28] his soul was just as young as he is
[1:35:31] right now
[1:35:33] because that molding took place at his
[1:35:36] new birth molding not molting molding of
[1:35:39] the person took place at the new birth
[1:35:41] that picture that God saw of him before
[1:35:43] time before there was even a fall
[1:35:45] brother rhymes with God took a picture
[1:35:48] and he's got this album
[1:35:51] and he puts it right there and he's like
[1:35:53] this is the way I look at God God says
[1:35:55] that's all I see
[1:35:58] I can hear your voice on Earth
[1:36:01] come on brother Brown said God don't see
[1:36:04] your face he said he hears your voice
[1:36:05] through the blood
[1:36:06] that's what the prophet said all right
[1:36:09] and I can understand that because
[1:36:10] brother bear said one second in front of
[1:36:12] God as a human you're dead
[1:36:14] that's why he was even scared to death
[1:36:17] when the angel of the Lord which wasn't
[1:36:18] God himself it was an angel sent from
[1:36:21] God he said his Shake
[1:36:24] because it was a spiritual being that
[1:36:25] was higher than him
[1:36:28] that's right okay
[1:36:32] so he looks at that picture and of
[1:36:34] course God don't have time
[1:36:36] so he said
[1:36:38] he'll be back in a minute
[1:36:41] he'll be back in a minute
[1:36:43] y'all like that song all you know
[1:36:46] if you see somebody that's that's
[1:36:48] passing away say hey I'll see you in the
[1:36:50] morning
[1:36:52] a Christian is only asleep for one night
[1:36:55] I don't care how long you've been dead
[1:36:57] in this side you've only been asleep for
[1:37:01] one night
[1:37:02] because what happens in the morning
[1:37:05] Resurrection
[1:37:09] so he looked at brother Howell he said
[1:37:11] he couldn't he sure he as brother Howell
[1:37:13] was going through his life he could hear
[1:37:15] him Lord Jesus forgive me
[1:37:18] Lord save my soul oh gotcha there you
[1:37:20] are all right you're my child just keep
[1:37:23] going oh you made a mistake okay all
[1:37:25] right
[1:37:26] what mistake
[1:37:28] that instant that instant he's forgot
[1:37:30] about it
[1:37:32] so now we come up to yesterday
[1:37:34] and guess what happened
[1:37:37] he sends an angel
[1:37:41] this ain't a fairy tale
[1:37:44] he sends an Angel that's been with him
[1:37:45] in that other dimension
[1:37:48] all of his life
[1:37:50] and he says all right you can step
[1:37:52] across over there and get him because
[1:37:53] he's going to meet you
[1:37:55] the body's got to stay over there
[1:37:56] because see it can't go through this
[1:37:59] Dimension there's a there's a gap
[1:38:01] there's a what did what did Lazarus what
[1:38:04] did Lazarus and the Rich Young Ruler he
[1:38:06] said there's a great Gulf fixed in other
[1:38:09] words there's a place that I can't get
[1:38:10] to you and you can't get to me there's
[1:38:12] something there all right it's called a
[1:38:15] dimension or a dimensional wall
[1:38:17] but when brother Howe passed away they
[1:38:19] didn't need to have to open the door for
[1:38:20] him to get out
[1:38:22] he just that quick
[1:38:25] boom and like sister Esther said in her
[1:38:28] in the WhatsApp got so gracious because
[1:38:31] you don't understand you've never died
[1:38:32] before
[1:38:34] you don't understand so he sends
[1:38:35] somebody bro Tatum or your dad anybody
[1:38:38] that's that knows brother Howe grew up
[1:38:40] with him he said he'll send them to the
[1:38:42] river
[1:38:43] I hope you cross
[1:38:45] when you break from that dimension
[1:38:47] into this one
[1:38:49] and that Angel's going wait a minute
[1:38:52] I'm
[1:38:54] the death angel said wait a minute now
[1:38:55] I'm supposed to take him somewhere
[1:38:59] and and the angel has been with him all
[1:39:02] of his time no he's right where he's
[1:39:06] supposed to be
[1:39:07] well I'm supposed to take him over here
[1:39:08] into this field no not that one
[1:39:11] no that one's special
[1:39:13] well you see that light around him
[1:39:17] we're going over here for a little bit
[1:39:19] and that actually that angel disappears
[1:39:23] into that sixth dimension
[1:39:25] with brother Howe
[1:39:26] and with all the other Saints just
[1:39:28] disappears back into that dimension
[1:39:31] and they're waiting there
[1:39:33] brother Mike Canada and all the
[1:39:34] different ones all the ones that's
[1:39:36] passed here they all knew each other
[1:39:38] listen if you knew if you knew him here
[1:39:40] you're gonna know him there
[1:39:42] brother Brown said look dad doesn't do
[1:39:45] but one thing
[1:39:47] changes your Dwelling Place
[1:39:49] does it change who you are
[1:39:51] so I'm telling all of you and I'm gonna
[1:39:53] tell you just like I told somebody the
[1:39:54] other day if you have Harvard feelings
[1:39:56] or if you have something you have a
[1:39:58] problem with with somebody you better
[1:40:00] get it right or you gonna carry it over
[1:40:02] there and then yeah over there may not
[1:40:04] be where you want to go
[1:40:07] oh
[1:40:09] yeah come on bro

[1:40:12] changes your Dwelling Place not your
[1:40:14] person
[1:40:18] get rid of everything
[1:40:20] you will not carry Harvard feelings in
[1:40:22] the sixth dimension
[1:40:25] you will not carry animosity in the
[1:40:27] sixth dimension
[1:40:31] you might carry it in another one you're
[1:40:33] going to go to but you're not going to
[1:40:34] carry it to the sixth one
[1:40:36] so let's look at this real quick is
[1:40:37] everybody okay we're all right just for
[1:40:39] a minute I want to get the spirit realm
[1:40:40] because now look we the soul the soul is
[1:40:42] what sealed in done finished it's gone
[1:40:45] what sealed until the day of its
[1:40:46] Redemption sealed until full Redemption
[1:40:49] sailed until even though this body gets
[1:40:51] so weak I was looking at dad the other
[1:40:54] day

[1:41:01] was always
[1:41:02] you know
[1:41:03] y'all too this tall
[1:41:05] picked him up the other day and he was
[1:41:07] shorter than me
[1:41:09] why the tolls of life

[1:41:26] that real him six foot three
[1:41:30] so we're gonna ask God to restore him
[1:41:33] back six foot three
[1:41:34] oh wait a minute on this side
[1:41:37] okay
[1:41:38] because you look at that and you see
[1:41:40] that you know how the Earth because you
[1:41:41] know what's happening sin is pulling you
[1:41:43] back into the Earth
[1:41:44] it's pulling you
[1:41:46] you got a downward pull even in this but
[1:41:48] now see your soul though is an upward
[1:41:50] pull so as soon as this as we're not
[1:41:52] going to read it tonight
[1:41:54] but as soon as this body goes there's
[1:41:58] another one waiting
[1:42:00] now really remember there's not one
[1:42:01] hanging up in a closet there's not one
[1:42:04] walk around going I hope that guy on
[1:42:05] Earth will hurry up and get here I'll
[1:42:07] just wait and I've been waiting on him
[1:42:08] all my life no you take Who You Are
[1:42:11] that body that Tabernacle you're making
[1:42:14] inside of you at the moment
[1:42:18] is this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:42:20] we have one waiting where is it it's
[1:42:21] inside of you
[1:42:22] and it just goes into another dimension
[1:42:24] leaves the shell here leaves the leaves
[1:42:28] the
[1:42:29] caterpillar it all dries up goes away
[1:42:31] dies but guess what caterpillar comes
[1:42:34] out all right look now let's go to the
[1:42:35] spirit realm because look second Peter 1
[1:42:37] verse five it would be wonderful to just
[1:42:40] stop right here and go hey this is good
[1:42:42] uh right here this is wonderful
[1:42:45] foreign
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:50] Promises by these promises we're
[1:42:52] partakers of the divine nature of God
[1:42:54] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:42:56] the world through lust in other words
[1:42:57] you're not going to go to the to the
[1:42:59] white zone judgment you're not going to
[1:43:00] have to be in a tribulation period that
[1:43:02] would be wonderful but wait a minute we
[1:43:04] got to get to verse 5. verse 5 says and
[1:43:08] besides this
[1:43:11] verse one two three four this is verse
[1:43:13] 5. and beside this now let's go to this
[1:43:18] right here that's called the spirit
[1:43:19] Realm
[1:43:21] the person you live with
[1:43:23] besides your soul
[1:43:26] the attributes let's just put it that
[1:43:28] way the attributes
[1:43:30] because the Soul's nature of the spirit
[1:43:31] brother Brown said all right so now
[1:43:34] Spirit Realm
[1:43:35] what is that memory reason conscious
[1:43:37] affection imagination that's kind of
[1:43:39] what you live in most of your time and
[1:43:40] you know what because of sin Satan is
[1:43:43] able to get into those five outlets and
[1:43:45] play
[1:43:46] all right play
[1:43:48] because if you're a Christian it's not
[1:43:50] playing
[1:43:51] he's just there for I mean he's just
[1:43:53] playing he's just there for a second
[1:43:54] he's just playing around right
[1:43:56] but when now Satan owns your soul
[1:43:59] he's got your spirit realm too all right
[1:44:02] but that's what the Battle Is Over
[1:44:03] remember Black Dog white dog
[1:44:05] your Chief why you have problem he said
[1:44:08] oh when me get born again after he said
[1:44:11] me have War
[1:44:13] may have white dog black dog
[1:44:16] well what it was it was a white dog in
[1:44:18] his soul and the black dog was out in
[1:44:19] the spirit realm it wasn't both of them
[1:44:20] in there at the same time fighting
[1:44:22] because what he does is he said well
[1:44:24] which one I feed the most the memory the
[1:44:26] reason the conscience affects and the
[1:44:27] imagination I'm feeding them and I'm
[1:44:30] going to really burden what's inside of
[1:44:32] me or we're going to do what we're going
[1:44:34] to take this statue of perfect man and
[1:44:35] we're going to release all that
[1:44:38] and besides this
[1:44:40] all right you with me giving all
[1:44:42] diligence
[1:44:44] diligent get off the couch
[1:44:46] hold on get out of the baby pen
[1:44:50] mama
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:45:00] kind of funny but that's kind of way we
[1:45:02] are sometimes as a Christian
[1:45:04] Daddy
[1:45:07] I thought the Bible said come boldly
[1:45:09] I thought them checks was written where
[1:45:11] you can write whatever you I mean give
[1:45:13] you where you can write whatever you
[1:45:14] want to all right but now we're going to
[1:45:16] get to a place though that now listen
[1:45:18] we're going to get to a place where God
[1:45:19] said hey I trust you
[1:45:22] I'm gonna give you the whole checkbook
[1:45:24] you've got the bank
[1:45:26] and the checkbook
[1:45:28] if you need something if I'm not if not
[1:45:30] if I'm not around if you can't find me
[1:45:33] just write just write your own name
[1:45:35] there
[1:45:36] just write your own name it'll be just
[1:45:38] as good
[1:45:39] as my name
[1:45:40] now he's not going to do that right here
[1:45:42] though
[1:45:44] can I write a check
[1:45:47] no no you cannot
[1:45:52] and that's the way we are hello somebody
[1:45:54] and that's the way we are God don't give
[1:45:56] you something
[1:46:00] looking through the
[1:46:04] but women become mature though and God
[1:46:05] don't give you something you say Okay
[1:46:07] Lord
[1:46:08] I understand now
[1:46:11] there's something else coming better
[1:46:13] than what I asked for
[1:46:16] see the difference
[1:46:21] I I need my healing I need my healing
[1:46:24] then God says you need to hang on a
[1:46:26] minute
[1:46:27] because I'm going to use that trial as a
[1:46:30] blessing
[1:46:31] and you say Okay Lord
[1:46:33] whatever it is
[1:46:35] be it unto me according to Thy word she
[1:46:37] didn't have to she didn't have to listen
[1:46:39] to a chemist tell her how that God was
[1:46:41] going to plant a sperm and an egg in her
[1:46:44] womb and she'd not known a man she just
[1:46:46] had one question and finally after he
[1:46:48] answered that question he said she said
[1:46:51] be it unto me according to thy work all
[1:46:53] right so let's get in the spirit room
[1:46:54] just for a second sorry to go over a
[1:46:56] little bit besides this giving all
[1:46:58] diligence add
[1:47:00] to your face so look faith is not an ad
[1:47:02] faith is the new birth all right add to
[1:47:05] your faith that's why we're going to see
[1:47:07] brother REM talks about seven ads now
[1:47:09] look
[1:47:11] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:47:16] you see that
[1:47:18] one two three if faith is an ad if faith
[1:47:21] is not an if it's something you have to
[1:47:22] add
[1:47:24] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:47:27] but now if you add to your faith
[1:47:30] one two three four five six seven you're
[1:47:33] right in line to where you're supposed
[1:47:34] to be all right besides this giving all
[1:47:37] Dylan just add to your face see it now
[1:47:39] has become transferred it's not God's
[1:47:40] faith it's yours

[1:47:44] yours
[1:47:45] add to your faith
[1:47:48] virtue
[1:47:50] and take virtue and add knowledge to it
[1:47:53] take knowledge and add Temperance to it
[1:47:55] Temperance patience patience godliness
[1:47:57] Godless brotherly kindness we've been
[1:47:59] through this whole thing but we haven't
[1:48:00] got to that charity part yet Andrew
[1:48:02] brotherly kindness charity now hold on
[1:48:06] hold on
[1:48:08] that's the ad that's the building of the
[1:48:11] person
[1:48:13] all right they're by with me but you
[1:48:15] haven't come to full adoption yet
[1:48:18] so now let's read what this Spirit realm
[1:48:20] will give us Ephesians 4 verse 14. that
[1:48:23] we henceforth be no more
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:29] yo why can't I do that don't you I
[1:48:31] practiced that
[1:48:33] a lot
[1:48:34] that we asked you that we had forth be
[1:48:38] no more children look toss to and fro
[1:48:42] and carried about with every Wyndham
[1:48:45] Doctrine well I'll go over here to this
[1:48:46] Camp because it looks better oh I see
[1:48:48] that ain't right let me go over here oh
[1:48:50] they gotta wait down there group we're
[1:48:51] going back over here
[1:48:53] foreign
[1:48:57] by the slide of man preachers
[1:49:01] and cunning craftiness whereby look they
[1:49:05] preachers lie and wait to deceive but
[1:49:08] speaking
[1:49:09] [Music]
[1:49:18] first Peter 2 verse 1 said you also as
[1:49:20] Lively Stone see look think of these
[1:49:22] These are Lively Stones because what is
[1:49:24] a stone a stone is a revelation
[1:49:27] right a stone is a revelation listen
[1:49:30] these are Revelations of Jesus Christ's
[1:49:33] nature that you've got to get
[1:49:37] that you has Lively Stones wait a minute
[1:49:39] hold on lively
[1:49:46] yeah he has Lively Stones look are built
[1:49:51] up a spiritual house so we're building a
[1:49:53] spiritual house
[1:49:55] and holy priesthood to offer up
[1:49:57] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:50:00] by Jesus Christ
[1:50:02] wherefore also it is contained in the
[1:50:05] scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief
[1:50:08] Cornerstone which is what right here
[1:50:10] we're looking at starting our journey
[1:50:12] building the great Foundation Building
[1:50:14] to The Headstone which looks exactly the
[1:50:16] same as the corner all right everybody
[1:50:18] with me just for a minute because I lay
[1:50:21] inside a Chief Cornerstone elect
[1:50:24] precious
[1:50:25] and he that believeth on him shall not
[1:50:28] be look at that word confounded
[1:50:32] you won't be confused if you'll get it
[1:50:34] right
[1:50:35] listen get the right foundation
[1:50:39] unto you therefore which believe
[1:50:42] he is precious
[1:50:44] but unto them that which be disobedient
[1:50:47] the stone which the builders disallowed
[1:50:50] in other words what did the builders
[1:50:51] disallow the head
[1:50:55] this was rejected this wasn't because
[1:50:57] this has been this listen this is what
[1:50:59] happened in the church ages
[1:51:01] he was a Cornerstone he was the son of
[1:51:04] God
[1:51:05] the one that resided in their soul but
[1:51:07] you had a lot of babies
[1:51:10] in this group
[1:51:11] that stayed babies
[1:51:13] that didn't grow especially the ones in
[1:51:16] here
[1:51:17] because he had to restore back to where
[1:51:19] brother Brown could come right here and
[1:51:21] zerubbabel
[1:51:24] I had to build the temple again
[1:51:26] all right
[1:51:27] unto you therefore which believe he is
[1:51:29] precious but unto them which be
[1:51:31] disobedient the stone which the builders
[1:51:34] disallowed the same has made the head
[1:51:36] down here of the corner but now look
[1:51:38] what it becomes
[1:51:41] it becomes a stone of stumbling
[1:51:44] a rock of offense a fence
[1:51:47] even to them which stumble look at the
[1:51:50] word
[1:51:51] amen what being disobedient listen
[1:51:54] if you're not doing this you are
[1:51:56] disobedient
[1:51:59] even though you're born again you can be
[1:52:02] a disobedient child
[1:52:07] even to them which stumble at the word
[1:52:09] being disobedient where unto also they
[1:52:12] were appointed there's some people not
[1:52:13] going to make it all the way up such a
[1:52:15] perfect man but ye are a chosen
[1:52:17] generation a royal priesthood
[1:52:20] a holy nation of peculiar people
[1:52:23] that you should what show
[1:52:26] live
[1:52:27] walk
[1:52:29] the Praises of him who have called you
[1:52:32] out of Darkness
[1:52:33] into His Marvelous Light which in time
[1:52:37] past were not a people
[1:52:39] you were scattered everywhere believe in
[1:52:41] every
[1:52:46] but now you've been brought into a place
[1:52:48] not just this building but into a place
[1:52:50] the message of the hour the the truth of
[1:52:52] the message of the Bible
[1:52:54] now
[1:52:57] which in times past were not a people
[1:52:59] but are now the people of God
[1:53:03] wow he just put you in another group
[1:53:05] listen when God puts you in a group
[1:53:07] glorified
[1:53:08] when man puts you in the group don't
[1:53:11] just disallow it but when God puts you
[1:53:13] in a group be happy with it he's put you
[1:53:15] in a place called bride
[1:53:18] which look which had them not which had
[1:53:20] not obtained Mercy but now
[1:53:23] listen it's a merciful grace of God that
[1:53:27] you get these virtues working in your
[1:53:28] life
[1:53:30] but now have obtained Mercy First Peter
[1:53:34] 1 verse 22 seeing you have purified your
[1:53:37] souls in obeying the truth through the
[1:53:39] spirit of the unfeigned love of the
[1:53:40] Brethren we've read this before see that
[1:53:43] you love one another with a pure heart
[1:53:44] fervently Being Born Again In other
[1:53:47] words going through the sanctifying
[1:53:49] process again
[1:53:50] get remember them remember the uh
[1:53:53] division getting out all the trash the
[1:53:56] trash was the trash was coming out here
[1:53:58] not down here
[1:54:00] trash was coming out right here remember
[1:54:02] he was pouring in the water he'd come
[1:54:05] out trash and sticks and all that was
[1:54:07] running out of me and you
[1:54:11] being born again not a corruptible seed
[1:54:13] but have been corrupted by the word of
[1:54:14] God which liveth and biteeth forever
[1:54:16] Hebrews 5 verse 10 says called of God a
[1:54:19] high priest after the order of
[1:54:21] Melchizedek of whom we have many things
[1:54:23] to say and hard to be uttered seeing
[1:54:26] it's your Dole of hearing you know what
[1:54:27] he's telling them he said you really
[1:54:28] don't understand this Melchizedek person
[1:54:30] but brother Brian never said that
[1:54:33] you should never say that
[1:54:35] who is this Melchizedek if you'll read
[1:54:38] that book or listen to that tape you'll
[1:54:40] find out who Melchizedek is
[1:54:43] of whom we have many things to say and
[1:54:45] hard to be uttered uttered senior doll
[1:54:47] of hearing
[1:54:48] you hadn't been taught or you'd be able
[1:54:50] to shut your mind off
[1:54:52] for when for the time you ought to be
[1:54:54] teachers you have need that one teach
[1:54:56] you again which be the first principles
[1:54:59] of the Oracles of God and are become
[1:55:01] such as have need of milk and not of
[1:55:04] strong meat for everyone that uses milk
[1:55:06] is unskillful and the word of
[1:55:09] righteousness for he is a babe
[1:55:12] but strong meat
[1:55:15] belongs to them that are a full age what
[1:55:18] a pair full age
[1:55:21] even those who by reason of use
[1:55:25] have their senses
[1:55:28] memory reason conscious faction
[1:55:31] imagination
[1:55:34] have your senses exercised to discern
[1:55:39] Good and Evil
[1:55:43] Ephesians 1 verse 4 says now look we're
[1:55:45] still in the spirit realm we're still
[1:55:46] getting rid of all that stuff in our
[1:55:48] spirit realm the memory reason conscious
[1:55:49] affection imagination according as he
[1:55:51] has chosen Us in him before the
[1:55:53] foundation of the world that we should
[1:55:55] be whole in Without Blame before him in
[1:55:57] love thank God that's what he said about
[1:55:58] us having predestinated us unto the
[1:56:01] adoption so now we got in the right
[1:56:03] family we know where the will is
[1:56:06] we we do have a uh um a better view of
[1:56:11] our will
[1:56:12] let's just put it that way we have a
[1:56:14] better view of our will we know even
[1:56:15] what between the lines of the wheel is
[1:56:17] we know what he's wanting to give us
[1:56:19] even though he didn't put in plain
[1:56:20] language
[1:56:22] having predestinated us unto the
[1:56:24] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:56:26] what to himself according to the good
[1:56:29] pleasure of his will not yours
[1:56:31] adoption series brother Brown said look
[1:56:34] we'll stop right here I won't get into
[1:56:35] adoption because adoption will talk
[1:56:37] about placing we'll talk about the
[1:56:39] checkbook we'll talk about all the
[1:56:41] things about adoption what is adoption
[1:56:44] now let me get this now I don't know
[1:56:46] musicians go ahead and come on I won't
[1:56:48] have time to get through this but I'll
[1:56:49] hit it then if there's a question you
[1:56:51] ask me a little later in the message
[1:56:53] your adoption
[1:56:55] is not your birth
[1:56:57] all right
[1:56:59] your adoption is your placing
[1:57:02] we've talked about being born again
[1:57:04] receiving the divine nature of God
[1:57:07] getting you into the family of God and
[1:57:09] then receiving the benefits of being in
[1:57:12] the family by the reading of the will by
[1:57:13] your senses being exercised in the right
[1:57:16] way not the wrong way
[1:57:18] but your adoption is your placing
[1:57:21] when you were born again John 1 17 I
[1:57:24] believe when we were born again the
[1:57:25] spirit of God we are sons of God
[1:57:29] but we were predestinated
[1:57:32] now here's what I'm trying to get to for
[1:57:34] this sons of the last day us
[1:57:36] we were predestinated
[1:57:39] unto adoption
[1:57:40] so what is adoption adoption is your
[1:57:42] placing
[1:57:43] it's giving you Authority it's giving
[1:57:46] you power more power than you've ever
[1:57:47] got in your whole entire life but you
[1:57:49] know how to use it let's stand our feet
[1:57:52] we'll talk about adoption
[1:57:54] because see in second Peter 1 verse 8 we
[1:57:56] we read second Peter 1 verse all the way
[1:57:58] down to seven that tells us we got the
[1:58:00] divine nature of God that we need to add
[1:58:02] these virtues and look this is the
[1:58:05] benefit I'm going to read this and this
[1:58:06] is where we'll start next time I preach
[1:58:09] next Sunday second Peter 1 verse 8 looks
[1:58:11] for if these things be in you what if
[1:58:14] these things
[1:58:15] all right divine nature of God
[1:58:17] receiving these virtues all right what's
[1:58:20] it going to give you what's the promise
[1:58:22] that you're going to get when you get
[1:58:23] all these virtues working in your life
