out your power and love holy holy holy amen LIF Your Glory pour out your power and love we hly Hol amen holy holy holy holy holy holy to see amen and amen and amen you want to see him look right into his word and you find him amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord hope you enjoy this morning maybe I'll have enough voice and enough cough drops to last this afternoon but we'll do the best we can amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord remember brother Quinn will be with us this coming weekend on the 11th and remember then we will be going up the Lord willing or at least the van will waiting them and and all on Friday of this week to go to Ruth meeting we try to make one meeting we can you know each year if we can and but we got to leave here about got to leave wagees at 2:00 so make sure you let us know if you want to go you know and but we'll be coming back that night so it's going to be you know up in the night a little bit but it's not that bad uh 3-hour drive or something but just remember that remember brother Quinn then remember brother Danny will be here on the 18th and listen uh children uh please stay out of the tape room now some of you children have been going into the tape room and causing a lot of problems in the tape room all right don't don't that's not a playroom it's it's a very small room but it's not a play room to go in there and play cuz you you can do a lot of damage so parents instruct your children don't play in the playroom we got plenty of other places to go play and do like that okay all right so just remember that you like turning your scriptures to Romans 8 where we've been reading and then Joshua 24 Romans 8 Joshua 24 Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for your love unto us and your guidance and understanding thank you for you we ask you now that you would just come Lord and speak to us give us your understanding that we may walk in your love because that's our desire forgive our sins cleanse us Lord and keep us just bless each one remember those that are not here and one's out way Lord Brother Dean there at his brother ministering just be with them weighing them down with there at the funeral lord of the viewing and things and just bless them Lord take care care them on the way home have your way we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen Romans 8 and then we go to Deuteronomy I excuse me Joshua Romans 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son now remember as I told you when you're reading scripture read it as to whether it's speaking past tense present tense or future tense you know read it as you're looking at it see and it says for whom he did for no all right for knowledge he also did predestinate to what to be conformed to the image of his son all right so that's in time coming down that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren more of whom he did predestinate he done it back there because of looking forward then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and then we Justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us now we'll go back to this one scripture there in in Joshua the 24:15 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the god gods of your fathers that's your father in other words watch now whether the gods which your fathers served they were on the other side of the flood are of the Gods of the amorites in whom Land We dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing so think about it choose you this day whom you'll serve right he said if you're not if you're going to serve God serve God if you're not going back to where you come from follow after these gods or go over here and follow after these Gods over here see so if you're not going on with the word just going on back you know where you come from right but he said for me in my house will serve the Lord all right now let's get in into the thought because we covered this morning the scripture of our word it says for us in talking about it that to make sure all right make sure you're calling an election amen other words make sure it's right you know check it out see if what you got is real see if that was God that called you or somebody else make sure you're calling right then make sure your election is right and then how did we cover from the prophet how does God elect well he just chooses this when chooses J now we read this morning over and over and over that he elects by for knowledge cuz he wouldn't everybody be saved that's right well you just don't understand brother Dale it's such a mystery it it it would be a mystery to learn how that God could do things according to what us mankind think he ought to do it it would take two or three Gods to figure out our ways of thinking about what we think it should be but just remember he doesn't do it according to our thinking but he does work according to our desires amen so we desired to be saved he provided away right all right so then then we did we capable as we're going to get in this evening we were capable then of making a choice I know the scriptures says salvation is of the Lord agreed amen that's 1,000% true right but God will not as we'll cover today override your freeo agency that's right amen he will not make you be saved that's right if you don't want to be righten so then in his electing it would have to be according to what you desire right right see it wouldn't be upon just any other some goodness or something but it would be your desires cuz our goodness is not worth anything you wrote around him I gave you a couple this morning where he said Abraham was no different he wasn't a special guy David wasn't no different as a matter of fact you find flaws with all of them amen even flaws of David say that we wouldn't even think about murder adulterous all kind of things that David was but see he had an honest and a contrite heart he desired to serve God but he just didn't have anything inwardly to be able to lead him right that's right so he followed it from the best he could outwardly right and in doing that he tried to do what God told him to do and God never told him to build him a house but he desired to build him one then God had to come down and say now David you there been too much bloodshed and you can't build a house but said solom going to build it David never got all mad and flustrated and boy tell you what I'll just I'll just quit you know I I can't see this I can't follow what brother Dale says or whatever I can't you know go in this I just quit oh go ahead you prove your own predestination that's right but then you'll blame me see because you'll say I can't understand do you pray for understanding and when you don't understand a message I preach you go talk to everybody about it instead of going home sitting down put on the tape listen to it again you don't get it listen to it again if you don't get it listen to it again I ain't got time to listen all this you got time to get on the phone and run your mouth oh okay you got time to talk to somebody else about what you don't agree with that's right whether it be out in the parking lot or whether it be on the telephone and you get home you got time to do all kind of things like that but you don't have time to search out and why don't you come and ask me a question it don't bother me for you to come and say brother Dell I don't I know what in the world you're talking about I said well I'll try my best to explain it again you know well because I want you to see what I'm talking about right amen and I know for ass I can't reveal it to you that's right so don't worry about that I just try to worry about making sure my wording is right and I know humanly speaking it's a problem you know to get your wording right but I also know too when one once we close our mind if we close our mind God cannot open it up right because that would be overriding your free moral agency you must open your mind you remember the prophet saying that one time he's talking about it he said now people will tell you he said we're in a group now he said they'll say blank out your mind you know blank out your mind now he said you do he said you open the channel forever devil there is to come into your mind I never asked you to blank out your mind I ask you to stop just a minute and think about it that's right you know consider what he said so we we've got I had brother Joda make a little drawing and uh if you will give these out we'll give them to you to keep what it is but he's going to put it up on the board for us and I'll just make a couple of comments about it go ahead brother Joe and just put up the a little drawing that we got together and this may not be all together in the way we needed it but it's just something I was thinking about because I want you to to try to remember as I said this morning a l you know now all I've been covering has been on this side of this line and I put this perfectly here as to the split of the mind that God in his mind will know what these are taking about but there's a part about God's mind that's back brother brand will call it Christ mystery God reveal back in the back part of God's mind all right so I split the line where I want to but remember what all we're covering and all of it has been in remember the point what predestination looks back to for knowledge for knowledge looks to Destiny all right election will look back right this morning to for knowledge and this Destiny can be set because of that so I just put a few things on it cuz this is the for knowledge of God in the for knowledge of God you got the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and you got election to deal with calling mind predestination choosing for knowledge for Sol for no Plan of Redemption see the word back there then when we cross over into time of it being lived out then we're going to have to deal with free will we're going to deal with free moral agencies which was covering today you're going to deal with choice or choosing and we put free will twice but I guess what what it needed to be Destiny in time because that's where his Destiny is set for in time receiving eternal life is what we must do in time but see we say oh but we always was eternal well then Jesus didn't have to die to get it to us in time then so you really annihilated your whole Bible all right we deal with justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost being glorified uh becoming the word adoption Redemption completed Cedar word and then we'll get on to it Lord willing Wednesday whosoever will see those are just a few things to think about and to just place them to where we're talking because everything I've covered in the five messages up till now is over in this area it is not back in here amen because that is your mind with a forn knowledge and that's just a drawing cuz sometimes people like those things it helps them to hold a point at least I can say this is on this side of the line and then you keep that with you and you look down there and say we know what side of the line is on CU When We Get Over far enough to finish up what we're doing we're going to drop back over into here and cover some things and then we will be dealing with the seed cuz I believe in a predestinated seed I do we're talking a little bit about it last night see I believe that God I believe as I said that Luther he could have taught justification in many uh courses or many you know things and maybe even taught some real good things about it but it wasn't alive it was sowing a seed yeah but one day that seed Was Made Alive and when he did he said the just shall live by faith that was predestinated eternally from God not Luther go brother around says a person doesn't come predestinated eternally from God the person comes into the for knowledge situation that's right he said but the word are seed come predestinated eternally amen so we got a lot to go when we get on the other side don't worry about it but now look we tried to bring out this morning make sure of your calling an election in other words know how you was called what it consist of God calling you to Salvation we see we tried to cover the point that now see you're going to say well no that's not true but listen then everybody in the world is called not because they heard a voice or heard the gospel you what understand me everybody has a desire to serve God that is the calling no no it's a hearing of voice well see then when you make it that way then I'll ask for a raise your hands any me ever heard the voice of God did you hear the voice of God calling you or was it something inwardly that's right that he begin to deal with not an audibly thing so then the hot and tot who knows nothing about God but will be given eternal life because he's a creation he knows as a Creator so he has a call in his life we gave it where Moses had it and brother around said every man has ever bornn in the world had that same doing see God is a great God he can do things the way he wants to but there's one thing he can't do you said brother Dale what do you there's one thing God can't do well there's two or three or maybe more but just one good one he can't go any other way except what his word says so we find it in the word we depend upon the word amen so he can't lie to us right he can't change his mind about his word so we find it in the word we just believe it that's right amen just believe it that's what I said last night trying to explain I saw it in the word God spoke in his word to me and said you'll be there with your Offspring that's scripture you know I believe that right so my children are serving the lord H some of the grandchildren are trying to some of them are not some of the kids didn't want to serve God too much either but they come to it not because they are my children right but because I believe what he said am I can't BL it on anything else but that but other people see their kids are not serving the lord and different things they get upset at you when you say God spoke to me about my family well I can't help it maybe if they have spent some of their time praying about the kids instead of beating them over the head so much it might have changed a lot of things that's right but see God is election he elects by for knowledge we read or looked this morning at e19 of God's covenant these are not on the internet I mean on the screen but e19 of God's covenant with Abraham God by for knowledge could set election paragraph 106 of the adoption election looks back to forn knowledge and predestination on to Destiny E9 of the power of God preach 55 predestination looks back to for knowledge and for knowledge to Destiny I don't see why it could be any simpler brought than those thoughts yeah but you just don't you just don't have a revelation of the great thing we have okay just pray for me see God can only then predestinate by what he for knows for saw cuz you look down through time and seen it that's right see then he could write the Bible yes and tell the things what's always been amazing to me is you got a man named Moses and Moses gave the Ten Commandments we talk about that but you know that Moses wrote five books some way he tapped into the mind of God and went back and told of the Garden of Eden yes I mean that that amazes me you say well that was just hand me down thoughts you know you know they do those things in tribes and people and everything just hand down knowledge you know and a lot of them have no typed out records of who was born from who they just set aside certain people to remember and they remember all of the things and the they can tell you who skin folks to who and whatever but see God don't have to do that he just sits there and looks down through it and sees what it is but see what I love about it his forn knowledge would let him see the whole world would you agree with that but see why didn't he just go on vacation in I mean he knows it what did he just pull back and say y'all fight it out I'll meet you at the end of the road and that Prophet said that day he said God came down and busied himself with the children of Israel in all of their troubles and that I just rejoiced but I thought if he done that to them what will he do for you and I he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you always he didn't say always because sometimes we ramble around and fall over into stump holes that he wouldn't be in that's right so he said I'll be with you always I'll never leave you yes right not always but I'll never leave you cuz sometimes he has to pull back his presence amen Prophet said but don't worry about it he ain't too far and said he's waiting on you to call him back yes we call it sitting out on a limb you know we're doing whatever all right but now listen God then predestinate by his looking down through time and then we can look at it and seeing that we have a choice we have a choice choose you this day whom you'll serve we have a choice all right then by having a or being able to make a choice he would predestinate by what he foresaw right not even just what he fornew that would seem to put a point of just looking out but for Saul would mean that he's right here right if you think God doesn't deal that way I'll remind you like I was saying this morning about let me get this I forget it okay somebody raise your hand off come back to the point he foresaw everything he told brother Brandon one day brother brand said I think I'll just go out here and become a Hermit I'll go up in the mountains I'll become a uh a prophet and just stomp out with the message you remember what he told him he said turn around and look he said you see that garbage pile burning right remember he saw was who was it bro or who the different ones you know and he said you go ahead and take your choice and that's where you'll be and you realize that God was laying before him what he would do if he went either way then don't life at me so much about thinking that he would know who I would marry and how many kids we'd have but he knew who I would marry if I didn't marry that one that's right he could look down through there and see as we read in the scriptures we could go this way but said if we go that way you're going to fall for that so we're going to go this way he knows which way we're going amen right but we have a choice in life yes now it's what he fora and he forsaw us as Desiring to be saved all right then he would have it ready for us amen all right see then we start dealing with a little point of freem moral agency and some of the preachers in the message especially back in the 70s they used to preach that freem moral agency was based upon our only far the foolish virgins and things but the bride was predetermined yeah all right but I can't see it that way because of the way the prophet says things what is free moral agency it means that things are laid out in front of you and you need you can make a choice amen that's right of which way you want to go that's how simple free moral agency is it's not a stamping of something right making this is the only way it can be it means you have a choice right right you can decide make your calling an election sure well because you have something to do with it that's right amen God's not going to make you saved that's right or he's not going to make you be lost he's going to leave the choice to you but if he's God then he knew the choice that's right that shouldn't be any problem amen and when we finish all of this up and we get dire then we'll be happy about what we see yes I'm happy about what I see now but all right so let's deal a little bit about free moral agency let's watch and start with the things something the prophet had to say about three more agency go ahead to number one this is taken from paragraph 154 through 157 of marriage and divorce preached in uh 65221 the morning service he could not be just and make a man to fall he had to put him on equal basis right he had to put him on equal basis of free moral agency to make his own choice yes but knowing he could fault and he could be a savior he could do that but look equal basis equal basis means it's you know God put it into your lap for you to decide amen that's right that's right I like the way the prophet said it he said I don't vote he said I voted for God or something like this and he said the devil voted against me no Jesus voted for me the devil voted against me he said I cast my lot with Jesus he said I don't vot more am amen you see it puts us on an equal basis right you ever thought about an equal basis what would you be talking about God gave us he made the way he paid the price yes but he doesn't make us take it that's right amen so he left it to be whatever we choose okay that's equal not equal with God not making us equal that way yes but making us as we could choose that's right amen an equal basis right think about it he explains coming down he said but if he takes and loses it just in order to say that then he isn't just to his judgment isn't Justice to his judgment he couldn't send a man to hell and be just he is kind gentle true honest he's a great judge see all right see would be working against himself so we had to put man put a man out here and make him on free moral agency so he would knowing would fall and the man in his own image how could he fall now you see the Daylights that he comes up and shows you the what that the woman wasn't in the original creation and not being that then it started to fall but a free moral agency see if you look at God get to the point of the basis that he puts you on if he overrides in any way your thoughts to make you be saved what has he done all right we've read that one right brother Dick's quoting it he put you in a pipe pushed you through the other end said I predestinated him that's right but if he puts you on an equal basis mhm that means Satan doesn't have the majority right right even though we did belong to him that's right amen so he's not ruling it he put us on an equal basis with him into what the ability to choose that's right amen now that's the greatest thing if you don't get nothing this afternoon you get one point your ability to choose is a wonderful thing amen and you can't blame nobody else that's right amen because you chose you chose the way you wanted to go amen God didn't make you choose a wife he gave you an opportunity unity and you could choose right and make you choose a job that's right it gives you an opportunity you choose right choice is a wonderful thing that's right amen and brother forny said Wednesday night I get tick at him because he's always cutting us pretty heavy he know most of us work General Motors you on on on chevret basis and you remember what he said he said driving a Ford but see if it wasn't the basis of that why wouldn't gentle Motors Ford and all of them come up with a she before the Cadillac and everybody have the same car hey some of them out there is so ugly I can't even stand look at them and I see some of them little bitt ones I think of myself going down the road if I raise up my head hits the top if I move my foot it's going out into the to the motor you know like Bob's got one and then even got one it's got an electric deals and but you see we're based on Choice that's the kind of home you live the kind of car you drive the kind of clothes you wire wouldn't it be something sisters if everybody wore the same a lot of you ain't old enough to remember this but brother how is all the women in our community wore the same color dress that was made different maybe same material same color you know why because they sent chicken feed out to the chicken houses in sacks my wife used to take them and make clothes out of them that was even after we married you were you could but everybody Ain it something you sisters you you just get so mad you go and you shop and you buy a dress nobody ain't got one these you put the thing on you go to town there goes one there goes another one there goes another they all shopped at hamricks you know see Choice that's a wonderful thing because we can choose what we want that's right free moral agency lays within our hands the right to choose right amen right all right is that a good definition of it yes look what he says in pray of transformation 1965 10:31 the morning service he just let them out there on free moral agency let them act he couldn't make them do it and still then still be just but he could put them equal with him he didn't mind saying it and free moral agency then let them do itel but he knew what they would do by man having a choice doesn't make him a robot that's right it makes him a human being and he has a choice that choice is called free moral a agency that's right that you can choose what you desire yes got a lot of them so let's read fast paragraph 4950 of as God change his mind 65 427 now to be a savior there has to be something lost and God cannot purposely lose some lose anything and then redeem it it wouldn't be becoming of his Holiness and his great judgment but he put man on freem moral agency knowing that man would fall and in that then he became man himself in order to redeem back man that fell that's right amen he gave you Choice yes we have that choice to make all right leadership Matthew 65207 paragraph 153 number five brother sometime in life we have to confront the thing just like this young man did because you're a mortal being and you are given the the are given the opportunity to choose you have a choice God made it so you can choose M if he put Adam and Eve on freeor agency so they could choose and then they made the wrong choice and see he can do more he can do no more to you than he did to them so it looks like free moral agen is dealing with us he's got to put you the same thing so you can choose or reject you have a choice right next one Revelation 4 part 3 6118 paragraph 23 or yeah paragraph 231 how did he St will and see we can take a topic off of self-will or free more agency but it's the same thing why will you call that self-will brother randam because it puts a man and a woman back again just like Adam and Eve at the Garden of Eden on what the two trees self-will this one is death this one is life self- will and more free more agency God placed the first man Adam and Eve right here on Freemore agency he places you the same place and the only way that you can get this thing uh fixed is in here is your own self-will Hallelujah your self- will you have to will to do God's will you have to get rid of your own will to let God's will come in for this is the only channel that leads to the heart all right next the Messiah 1961 e13 117 then on the inside he has only one gate one entrance to go into the sh sh Glory where God can enter into him and take over in the control tower don't now he's talking about Redemption right saving and that way is through self-will okay whether you will to or not that's up to you but that's the only Avenue that's open to the man that God can come into his heart is by self will puts him right back like Adam and Eve on free moral agency again you can choose right or wrong either one you want to self will it doesn't seem that we've read anything that God is just making you do what you're doing everything's on self-will that's right fre moral agency all right next is adoption 196 518 he saw that Luther would do that oh how many knows he's infinite come on I'm getting myself not them they're okay he saw that Luther would do that if he created this he put them Luc Lucifer he saw that Lucifer would do that if he created this he put them on a free moral agency words he saw Luther what he would do if the mankind is put on free more agency all right that basis and you're still there that's right the tree of right and wrong says before every one of us you make your choice and Lucifer was the first one to take the wrong road and he began to draw after him H hoggish trying take all for himself trying to override somebody else and that's where it started and listen to this that's where sin began God In His Infinite mind saw that and saw the only way so he's explaining the point of that is what the way Lucifer gets to you and I is true self will that's right amen that's right he can't bother you if you don't open the door that's right even when your property of his you know what I mean before he was born again yes your property of the devil yes and you can still decide what you want to do and not want to do that's right amen I did I said I wouldn't going to drink I didn't I didn't not to I'm a Christian to stop drinking I didn't want to drink see Satan couldn't get that on me I didn't care nothing about smoking he just didn't have much far me sure didn't like chewing tobacco thought I was doing pretty good one time I got sick I decided right then I didn't need that anymore so then s we will is a lot to do with you free moral agency is a lot to do with a human being that's true because you and I are sitting just like Adam and Eve Amen on a free moral agency you can go to church yes or you can stay at home you can serve God or not serve him you make your own choice amen right cuz he'll give you plenty of excuses yes to not go to church yes right right but I've always tried to explain something about us humans that shows how dumb we are true that's you're feeling down and out yes and nobody loves you and you say I just won't go to church today nobody wants me there anyway and the devil just cries on your shoulders back you're right honey you're right you you you know nobody don't want you there set your clock service starts at 10: and up until 10 the devil is really on your side right right he gave you every excuse in the world you don't feel good you don't this you don't that but 5 minutes after 10 that's right he changes his tactics and he says see there you proved you ain't nothing right am I right he gets off of giving you excuses for not going and starts condemning you because you didn't go right amen then you might as well just get up and go and forget it whether anybody likes you or not way tells that story about the fell saying to his mama you know or said I'm not going to church today then people don't want me you know they just don't love me she said but you got to go so well tell me why I got to go because you the pastor I'm human too sister Freda you know I have problems too contrary to popular opinion I have a lot of them and I can figure out a lot of good excuses for not going to church but I got to go cuz I'm the pastor no they because of that cuz I'm going to override that free more l I'm going to take it threee more agency choice to my benefit that's true that's right come on if you're sick really sick you got two choices hospital or church right and according to the Bible and scripture and the teaching which one is supposed to come first like I told my family there one day the kids one of them was real sick they said what are you going to do I said I'm going to the church we're going to pray for him and I'm going to take them to the doctor what was there any problems no church is first but like I've always said now I know mean old dude you know you just I don't feel on going Monday morning I got to go to work cuz I got to make a living okay you're on threee more L you your choice I I thought we was living for the word I thought we ate to live right physically don't you eat to live a lot of people live to eat but and it shows but you getting me free will yes free moral agency yes we can choose amen okay go on to the next one what are we on we're about number nine which is what would you out to see 59 10:01 God doesn't send you to hell for being a sinner God sends you to hell because you won't repent and take Christ as your savior you refuse to take the right Road you send yourself to torment you send your own soul to Eternal destination upon the free moral agency of your own convictions God does not send anyone to hell he never did he never will men send themselves to hell because they refuse to accept the way of Salvation God isn't he's longsuffering he doesn't want any to perish never wanted it but men rather walk in darkness and to walk in light what about it free moral agency look at the next one number 10 taken from the faith of Abraham 56 or 55 11:18 paragraph are 18 and in the book of Ephesians the first chapter and about the fifth verse Paul stresses the word predestination us to the adoption of sons now that doesn't mean that God just puts you in a little Channel and runs you through and you can't help if you how you go when you you would be no reward but God gives you the free moral agency to make your own choice God will keep his believer though he gives you that to make your choice go ahead next one 5 blind bmus 57301 these people who are standing here at the altar tonight are those who that you have brought up Out of the Dust of the earth you put a spirit in them a spirit of free moral agency to make a choice to receive life life or refuse life you ever heard him say you can't raise your hand without a spirit making you do it that's right have you ever noticed he said if you step out of that aisle and head this way the biggest portion of your healing is already taken place the minute you step out that's why because you made a choice if not why come up here and be prayed for if you're not going to believe it I mean if you're not going to believe it stay back back there you're wasting our time amen but if you believe it come here and I believe it then we all believe it all right so what does he say look at the next one why is is that so many Christians find it so in the title of that is really why it says so many find it hard to live the Christian Life H 5733 how do he do it Out of the Dust of the earth and look and if it taken the Holy Spirit to brood me from the Earth to Call Me Out of the Dust of the earth now I'm based on the basis of free moral agency to receive it or to turn it down if you want life if want life I can have it if I want to refuse it I'm a free moral agent I can take the devil then but if I want God I can take God and and that's before every person that ever come on the earth for every person that ever come on the earth is based on free moral agency yes right to choose or reject yes why some people can't keep the victory 57 324 now man's on the basis of freem Moral freem Moral agency and he cannot God God could not take a man and say now I'm going to make you do this I'm going to make you be to be a lost man I'm going to make you be a saved man that wouldn't be the nature of God no he's not willing that any should perish but he wants all to repent but if he was being infinite as he is he knows from the beginning who would perish and who would not perish because he knew what would be now he's not willing that it would be that that way see he's not willing that it would be that way he wants all to come back to him but he knows who will and who won't right so therefore he could by four knowledge he can make everything work right according to his plan by for knowledge that's right make it according to his plan all right go within that number 14 it's adoption 196 522 and inside of him was an attribute of Savior how could one of those creatures when there was no sin or no thoughts of sin how could one of them be lost it couldn't be so there had to be something made that could be lost so he could be a savior inside of him was a Healer do you believe that he's a savior here you believe it he's a Healer well what if there wasn't nothing to save or healed see there had to be something made that way and never made it that way but he put man on free moral agency if you take this and live if you take that you'll die and every man that comes into the world is still set with the same same thing God by his for knowledge knew who would and who would not there was no problem right right see he couldn't make us be lost he puts us on a basis of freeo agency amen that's right to make a choice if you go home just run it in your computer free moral agency just run it in see how many there are I just chose a few you stand of the greatest battle ever fought he's talking about there's only one Avenue that God can come down and that's by the way of free moral agency God can't come in your soul except by free moral ageny CU if he did he'd be making you be saved right right that's right amen he's not going to make you be saved that's right the choice is ours so if it's going to come into us it's going to have to be on free moral agency God's children are on free moral agency this stature of a perfect man is a base of free moral agency because we can seek after God and try to see these things or we can just Skip Along halfhazard and not worry about it it's free moral agency we decide what we're going to do for imortal agency gives us a choice don't override the choice makes us just like Adam and Eve three more l agency gives a self will and a message called a prisoner number 19 637 717 and we're all born a free moral agent to make any cision decision that we wish to God justly does that because he must put every man on the same basis or he put the wrong man he put the first man on the wrong basis so if Adam and Eve was free moreal agency you and I got to be free moreal agency right or he put them on the wrong choice or us on the wrong choice so why can't we choose what we desire if God is working according to our desires and if we desire to learn of him we can learn of him that's true amen if we desire not to study pray and seek God I'm not saying you're lost I'm not I'm saying you're in dangerous territory but not going to say you're lost I think what we need to do is consider all the things that God has done for us right I like the statement the prophet said I don't live for God to try to keep from going to hell right I don't live for God just to keep from going to hell because if he cast me into hell thinking the way I am I'd live for him die Satan is your have problems we know it ain't going to happen but it's a good point right right so choose this day who you'll serve Amen brother de chose a long time ago all right then let's make our calling and election sure and let's see and let's get away from those doctrines and ideas of the people of the message that well I always was eternal so yeah are you saying it don't matter what you do or don't do Heaven Help a peanut brain person that would think that way the closer I get to God the more conscious I become of myself that's right that's the way it should be that's right the more conscious I become of my walk sure I know I'm a human being never claim to be nothing else you see what you get in me because I don't change I just walk right on but my desire is to serve God am amen and if I even miss the Rapture the change part of got to go by the grave that's no problem with me I'd sure love to be there cuz I fought it out down through 40 something years with it I I want to be there don't you amen amen sir but I know if he don't hurry it up I'm not going I got that much sense but I know he can fulfill it listening to tape the other day where he said the biggest portion of the Old Testament was fulfilled in the last I believe he said 6 hours of Calvary fulfilled all those scriptures of David singing in the spirit fulfilled all of those prophecies what it was saying amen so he could fulfill it in six hours and me and you could he that's right amen but what's our choice today yeah but Brother D I have to give up so much to become a Christian as to the young people would you be giving up anything no have we ever sit here a thought in your mind or something that we're not happy Christians I even sit back in my office there and I die life and I'm sometimes crying but we're just having a big time serving the lord and we just life and talk and everything's not oh amazing now let's don't get excited let's don't life you know why not enjoy life amen if you ever call me up and say Brother D how you doing what's my answer wonderful laying in the Floor of back killing me that's wonderful well on to me when I go to the doctor doctor said how you doing I said I'm doing wonderful she said well what are you going to the doctor for if you're doing wonderful so I got where I tell him I hey Doc I'm one feeling wonderful but I sure got a bad headache would you get rid of it for me you but everybody else go in there you know you see them sitting there in the chair and they walk in well doc I got this and I got that and I think I got this and I wonder if I got out doctors nowadays I I can make a good doctor you know what doctors do now they let you treat your own self right come on right ask you what do you think about well I think it's is I think that he okay I'll WR your pill for that right you thought hey we got nurses right all kind of nurses in here everybody just chooses their own medicine their own doings right but why can't we be happy and joyous and enjoy life you know I enjoyed working when I was at General the motors I enjoyed it of course we had a different set up the most of you had we had about seven guys that believe the same message working within just a little bit of each other sometimes shoulder to- shoulder all day so it wasn't a hum drum but they can tell you that I'm no different here than I was down there that's right you know why can't we be happy and joyous about what we see because if it's all in God is pre-stamped then I'd be very sad CU I wouldn't have anything to do with it you know I just asking what do you want me to do next but instead of that I just go through life and you know every once in a while he contacts me and comes by just enough to let you know he's there but he's never away from you that's right but yet you got a choice choose you this day whom you serve had to put us on equal bases and how was we explain an equal basis put me to word now listen to the wording but I don't have anything else he made you a God why because he made you with a choice that's right right right right come on did the prophet say little Gods little amateur Gods it gave you a CH a choice to make me you equaling with him on that choice cuz he can't override it I hope you understand that point he can't make you be saved if you don't want to be but he can't make you be lost if you don't want to be amen well no God no God can't make you be lost that's right he'd be breaking his word amen but he can't make you be saved either but he looks down and sees you make a choice to be saved yes and according to my Bible all Heaven starts rejoicing over one repentant sinner is that according to the scripture yes that's right free moral agency free will self will to choose yes don't blame the devil so much either right the devil made me do it now the prophet said the Devil Couldn't get into you he said you go out to him that's true I don't blame the devil for everything I've done wrong in my life that's right I blame myself amen I don't blame you or my mama my daddy or whatever well you act like your daddy I don't know I never was around my daddy so I can't say that I was about four when he died do you see what I'm talking about free moral agency yes gives you the right to choose yes what you want to be and God acts according to your choice well then I like to put these little thoughts in you know then is my destiny stamped is my destiny stamped and it's got to be right there that wall that's as far as I can go that's my destiny see now we want to try to make God kind of guilty but does he set the stamp or is this his for knowledge that we are living which one is it run in there sometimes you thought I was saying too much the other day about it but run in the prophet's message sometime and just run in does God change his mind are changing his mind just run it in your computer and read it you're sick you have a disease you have this that or the other as far as natural life is concerned you're doomed and dead right right cuz ain't nothing they can do that's right and if they do give you something for this one is going to kill you on the other side okay right that's right amen this may prong you a little while but is this is it stamped as a got to be thing why can't you believe this is what he saw and if this is what he saw the choices I make that's right could deter a lot we go by accident sometimes and we think well that was just meant to be but is it well I can't help being sick so I'm sick God knew I'd be sick right is that the way we think why not think about I'm dying but he changed it to where I could live that's right amen and that doesn't do away with his for knowledge that's right that's right but it sets us in a place if you caught what I'm talking about this morning this afternoon the main two things is what make your calling an election sure make your choice sure that's right amen MH choose you this day who you'll serve don't wait till tomorrow well I'll serve him but I'm going to run into the wall and that's it you know that's a robot you're sick you say well I'm sick well I guess I'll die with this you will I like brother Gary's daddy granddaddy Atkins I liked his way he might not have been a great uh religious Supernatural something maybe didn't follow this message but he had a point about him I liked he said they told him when he entered Medical School the first thing they said If You w't Hinder your patience was it 80% 50 or 80 85 85 or something it was he said if you don't hinder your patience 85% of them is going to going to live get well on or get well right that's a good point he said I never operate until I pray see he believed in prayer but he believed in having a positive attitude that's what I loved about him a positive attitude I don't mean wrong about it cuz Gary was making a living about it but he had a choice to go in a line to follow his daddy and make big money but he didn't choose to do that and his daddy would say Gary just be whatever you're going to be just be good at it that's wonderful choosing what we are that's just natural life amen go home this evening sit down in the chair I don't want to get up what's going to happen you ain't going to get up if you sat that long you ain't going to get up somebody's going to help you get up my wife gets on to me all time why don't you sit down I can't I'm up doing something because if I sit down I just don't want to get to do I don't want to do nothing so give me a hammer and a rock I'll beat on it I'll drive a nail and pull it back out why because I want to be doing something if I can be that in the natural what about in the spiritual I want you and I to get home with being what God wants us to be we're talking about it like not when brother Brandon said will the bride have a Ministry he said sure she consists of Apostles prophets of angelist pastors and teacher now they ask him would she have a Ministry he said she consist is what I told him last night you already get tap listen to it you make me what I am you pull out of me what you want to hear that's right and you can pull false Doctrine out of people too that's whatever false Doctrine does false Doctrine does start with a preacher preaching false Doctrine starts with the people Desiring the wrong Doctrine and they pull the preacher into being you want to St all afternoon talk about it the people had to be crying before Moses went down into Egypt right right but when he got down there or rose up the first time they didn't want him right you going to kill us like he killed the Egyptians right that's right so God sent him 40 more years let them beat it out and die and let them whip them to death and one day they was crying out you know they was willing for Moses to come back back and they'd listen to him maybe that's why we're here 40 or 50 years after the prophet went off the scene is because God is having to whip you and I into line Amen to hear the word let's Stand Together anybody has a need the altar open if not we're going into the communion thank on these things think on these things you have a need come and let's pray and believe my brother Aaron coming here we went through the lineup with all of the ministers and the deacons I guess we back down to me serving communion well because I want them to know what's going on and to be a part I want them to choose to be a part cuz they're on for moral agency but think about these things God is leaving it up to you and I to make a choice right cuz come on I tried to tell you the other day don't cabbage down on for knowledge cuz if you cabbage down on it you're going to sat down and say he saw me hit that wall I got to hit that wall so you're predetermining it you remember what the old colored brother said I believe this Bible from ker to ker even believe the ker because it's got go got Holy Bible written on now M do you believe that word yeah said what if God told you to jump through that wall he said i' jump well there's no hold he said ain't up to me up to him to get the hole there time I get there did he believe in the stamp seal there's a wall see this right here is what's destroying you and I they have proved it talk to these people who are in karate they teach you to look through the wall or through the block or whatever you're doing you look at it you'll break your hand if you look through it you can go through it you said well no I don't believe that see you're an unbeliever there's people that can run right through that wall and not let it stop them because they set their mind jump kick do things that it's impossible because theyve set their mind they've made a choice if that can be as I talking last night what do you think isn't it odd that hit Hitler wanted a what when was Hitler in a being 30s 40s right isn't it odd he wanted a super race of people you know he wanted a blonde race super race I never understand the blonde part you know pale I reckon but that's what he wanted you had never thought about that during the time he was trying to bring forth his super race God was getting a prophet ready to talk about a super race anointing was on that man he took a world to war anointing was on brother randam and he took a people to will take us to Glory what if Hitler picked that up of the super race but yet he tried to make it in the natural that's right and it won't work is there Supernatural it will work I've always told you they tried to tell the man you know that was supposed to never walk or anything and they had the four minute mile and nobody ever broke it and the guy that was supposed to not even walk got able to walk got able to run and you know they just didn't tell him that he couldn't do that he goes out and breaks a 4minute mile the little old bumblebee scientifically Impossible by the wingspan for it to fly they just forgot to tell the Bumblebee well let's get away from what people are trying to tell us and get into what God says about us right think on these things Paul said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me now after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep or we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this but when we are judged we're chasen to the Lord why that we should not be condemned with the world where my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man any hunger let him eat at home that you come not together in the condemnation the rest will I set in order when I come let's just have a few moments of Prior praying one for the other and just pray for people pray that we all make the right choice that we make our calling and election sure and we believe it in the correct way because it determines whether or not we're going to walk off the earth let's pray father we thank you for your loving grace unto us we thank you for the day that we have and we pray that you'd bless us now as we've come together for this purpose today and that is to take the communion and the foot washing and to walk in you Lord we know that we have a choice of these things but Lord what a wonderful thing to realize we do have an opportunity to choose that's better than having it stamped because there would be no overcoming in it if you stamped our Destiny without going by the forn knowledge of to see our destiny thank us to help us to think about Lord realizing that we're living our predestination and that way then I'm not worried about tomorrow I'm just living today we love you and we thank you in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it's been made for this purpose today Lord that we could take this part as we call it the communion that we could break the bread and we could all be together as one because it is showing of your body that is the word we ask you to sanctify this bread and the partakers that we may all be together as one in you in Jesus name always think about when we get over on the other side Heaven whatever you want to call it and we'll take the communion it'll be from the hand of the Lord Jesus it'll have a whole lot more serious meaning than it does now to us because of all of our carnality will be gone and our wrong thinking and will be set on one thing and you know wouldn't bother me a bit I don't think it will you for that not to be a quick thing but for him to take about a thousand years as he's breaking the bread and explain to us what all this has been about I like to look back and see where where I come from don't you not look back to Rejoice over what I done but to look back and see what I come from father we thank you for this wine that's gone through this process and now it gets better every day we pray now that you would just sanctify the wine the bread and all of us together is one in you that we may be what you want us to be upon the Earth thank you for giving us a choice and then predetermining by our choices Lord then we can rejoice and say you are our father and we love you thank you father in Jesus name hallelu come morning our our rest the Ever Green Tree how carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long then I take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning I by the river I'll rest the Ever Green Tree I'll car my cross through the midnight come morning there's Glory amen if we don't believe in being able to make a choice by free moral agent see why would we be concerned with to him that overcometh if it's a stamp sealed thing that's finished and we're only living out in life why would the Bible say to him that overcometh the prophet said it's not what you overcome he said it's how you overcome why wouldn't we want to take and believe that we are here for one purpose this bride in the end time is here for one purpose that's to become the word for the hour that we're living and to pull the dead out of the grave and then we'll be changed in the moment of twinkl of an eye what we're talking about last night in the order of the Rapture everybody wants to talk about the Rapture but according to the Bible there's got to be a resurrection before there can be a Rapture you know then we got to be changed before there can be a going away and all of that's going to happen right here while we're living and we are that people thank you Lord the Bible says we are the people that what that the ends of the Earth has come upon we have a job to do folks somebody's got to get that dead out of the Grave Why Can't We Believe we're the people that'll do it if not we got to wait for somebody else appreciate you you know what about it let's all protect together you can be seated for a moment while we get ready for the foot washing you know if we could just have a baptismal service we would have it all fulfilled today with me so if anybody wants to be baptized after the service is over with let me know I love to do that John 13 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas his carot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rided from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet he wiped them with a towel wherewith he was GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus Sith unto him he that is washed and he does not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was sat down again he said unto them know you what I've have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet but I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them let's stand together we just be dismissed from here and the sisters can go downstairs finish up the foot washing Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and we pray that it has been a day that you have revealed yourself unto us we pray that you would just bless us with your presence and your love as we go on to the foot Wasing and in traveling home be with everybody give a safe journey and may your grace and love be sufficient with each one we love you and we thank you for making us as we you've made us you made us a free moral agent and you look down and seeing what we would want and that's makes a wonderful family we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in Jesus name amen you're dismissed
