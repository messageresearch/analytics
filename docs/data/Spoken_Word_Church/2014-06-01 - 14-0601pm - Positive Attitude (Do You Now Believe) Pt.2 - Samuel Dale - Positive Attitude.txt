TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay so the mary's doing much better much better she's moving about pretty good and in good spirits and so uh and she can on uh she stood for a while yesterday too so that was good we're going good to the stand and of course both of us uh appreciate all your prayers and cuts and everything that they've seen so far uh i'm gonna try to sing this okay i have journeyed through the long dark nights out on the open sea by faith alone sight unknown and yet his eyes is better the anchor home though the cells are torn as i face the rage it's i had vision and i had dreams i've even held them in my hands but i never knew those dreams could slip right through like they were only is see in spite of the soul i have been young but i am older now oh and there's been some beauty these eyes have seen but it was in my his love the ship is better though the cells are torn is girl is i appreciate that amen i'm gonna have to find this one see the 246 or 210 coming down 246 in a red book and see amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah number 43 in the spiral book jesus has a table spread where the saints of god jesus all the time if disciples came to land jesus is no jesus jesus coming down time amen amen amen amen amen we indeed open the eyes of my heart i want to see open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart i want to see shining in the light of your glory you love him is amen holy holy holy i want to see you amen amen amen and amen i don't want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures let's turn to john 16 and continue our thought that we were talking about this morning from a positive attitude and we'll probably be using this for a while until we get a positive attitude and that's what the prophet said he said hold up something before the people till they get it then move on to something else so i pray that we'll do brother gary and i were talking the other day about it you'd have to be a minister sometimes especially a style that i use or more of the teaching style i guess and i get in a series and and you know i run for a while in that series well it's not too bad when you first start because you know you're getting started and you're learning and you're going you know you've got more more more services and things but when you come down to the end and you're getting about the last one and you don't know where you're going next that gets desperate you know you start to undoing but you know i've never had it for the lord to fail me yet but i've had that confidence in him and i'll keep that to give me another thought and just carry on as we try to move on all right but remember now that uh wade will be preaching first wednesday remember the bible study will be saturday six o'clock we're in the book of romans and we're just taking the scriptures and going along talking on them and really enjoying doing that so come and be with us and you know like and remember the to the brothers remember the uh men's gatherings or we'll go and have a few days of fishing and time together and all like that and we pray that you'd be able to come and go with us when we have a good time all right john 16 so let's pray the heavenly father we thank you lord that we have an opportunity to be able to come before a living god not to be an idol or a thought or an idea or a concept of somebody but to stand before a living true god the only true god the only one we can stand there and knowing confidence in our heart that thou art christ and you're still alive and we're just depending upon that lord and we place everything we've got upon it because there's nothing left over it's all in you we pray that you would just help us now to speak as you have given it unto us and then giving it unto us because we love to do that lord and talk about you when you come on the scene even in our own things and thoughts and ideas and begin to speak to our heart we love you and we pray that you this guy bless each one that's not here remember the sick among us you promised it so we believe you just come on the scene and take away the sicknesses and things and guide us into your love we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and guide us in you in jesus name amen john 16 we'll read starting at verse 25. you know it's this is where he's coming down he asked anything in my name uh you know ask the father in my name and he'll give it unto you then he says these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but that the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i will show you plainly of the father at that day you shall ask in my name and i say unto you that i will pray the father for you for the father himself loveth you and because you have loved me and have believed that i came out from god i came forth from the father and i'm coming to the world again i leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto him lo now speak us thou plainly and speak us no proverbs now we are sure that thou knowest all things and need us not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou came us forth from god jesus answered them do you now believe do you now believe you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we're talking about faith talking about a positive attitude we went through this morning speaking about peter and how that he was doing fine walking on the water until he got to looking at the circumstances around him and as he did he began to doubt and he lost his substance that he himself could walk on you know he didn't have to have any help he didn't have to have somebody to hold him up jesus wasn't holding his hand things wasn't taking place he didn't have a big rope or something to hold on to he had something within himself that was holding him up all right but then something happened and as it happened he lost that that was holding him up now he never lost his confession because he said lord help me you know save me he still had his confidence in him he could still look and see him he could still think about who he was and what he was and that's why we just moved over a little bit using this scripture that you know you you come to the time in the disciples lives that they finally said we believe we believe that you you come from god and he said do you now believe well then my mind runs over to another scripture that has always been helpful to me in thinking but it's talking about the end time and said will he find faith in all of the earth you know will he find a substance in the end time that somebody's going to have to walk off this earth on because we're all as believers are looking for a rapture caught away a time to leave this earth and things and we believe that we'll have to be changed and different things will happen but we also we're still looking for somewhere that somebody will come with the ability that death will not be able to destroy them or conquer them that they'll just walk right off the earth well you know we can look back and we can see that enoch walked off the earth one day that's what i want to get to on the positive attitudes and the things you know but you just walk right off the earth the prophet says that he pleased god with rapture and faith now we know that he did not have the new birth back there because the newton birth had not been given because jesus had not been glorified so there was no way for them to be able to be in the kingdom of god you know and that's why he would say that john the baptist was the greatest of all the prophets but yet the least in the kingdom is greater than john why because that the least in the kingdom has the new birth all right but what i want us to think about i want us to consider our thinking you know ourselves check ourselves do we have mental faith or do we have spiritual revelation now of course we make all of it as i guess you know try to make it spiritual revelation but there's a vast difference and i made the statement this morning that uh i want to make again and i'll probably make it in each service if you've never experienced something to happen to you that no way nobody could take it from you nobody could ever change you or whatever yet you just know that it's going to take place but if you've never had that you can you can make it look like you've had that because you can confess this or confess that and walk into it and something happened but remember jeannie dickinson was about 50 50 or 60 percent correct on her predictions well you know that means she's 50 or 60 correct on a prediction you know what that means she's about 59.9 better than i am that might not be the right figures to use but you get my point she has some reason or way of knowing some things you have to admit it you know all right then there has to be a world out there that or whatever forgive me for no education to explain those things they've got to be a place or something that you can reach and a lot of people can reach that but around some people just can't have faith you know i mean you can tell people about things and like the old man always referred to that worked at the plant when they went to the moon he just they called him dozer and he built snuff and he said they didn't go to the moon they just went out in the desert you know well you know my point's only been you know i try to look at things funny but i mean if you can go up so far and come back down in the desert you've still done pretty good all he needed is being able to straighten the thing out and keep going the other way but see he just wouldn't believe it and you can tell people about things that happen in your life who do you think you are you think you're a prophet i mean i say i saw god when i was 11 years old standing in the church you think you're prophet no i've denounced it publicly privately and everything i'm not a prophet no whatsoever all right but yet a lot of people's never seen things right and i understand that brother brown said you may never lay your hands on a person and feel a surge run through your body and see that person healed that you may never do that what are we going to say it doesn't happen because we don't believe it at least let me quote with the prophet he said if i might not be able to attain unto that place he said i don't want to hinder somebody else and they can attain all right now that's a pretty good statement for a man to make in his category of what he saw but what about it we're going to deal mainly for this part of the message and maybe another one or something more or less into the mental part and i i put it in here to make sure to cover when peter lost his substance remember you're not talking about the new birth you know yeah now there's no way to be born again and then be lost i i i you know if you're ever truly born again substance faith new birth there's no way to be lost so we're not referring to that we're referring to just us you know it's now where we're at talking about mental faith remember as i said this morning there's no way to have a supernatural spiritual revelation without it being first a mental thought even though you say well nobody didn't tell me that you got it somewhere you heard somebody say well see you're trying to impress and impressions don't work too good especially with me i'm just i reckon i've just been made that away i've had people to say things and i just say well just tell me you know because if i believe it i'm going to put everything i can behind it you know and i'm going to stand on that even if i stand by myself you know i was referring to it at lunch while ago with someone but my wife we was up in the garden one day and i told her something was going to happen she said it ain't going to happen i said if it don't happen i won't preach no more that's how much confidence i had in the situation and she said well i mean that was her you know she said you preached your life sermon well that was her but it took place and see i could put my faith in god i wish i couldn't everything i've always said i could i can i have one thing that came to me years ago that if you just tell me say and i know it drives most ministers haywire but you just say i want you to preach on the new birth well there's just an ability there that just goes into that or others say i've got to have an unction a leading i know i understand that i know that but if you know where you're at why can't you explain what you're talking about well yes you see preachers and they make a big show of i've got this thing but i can't explain it well shut up you you got banana pudding and you won't let me have none of it you know you got a big red watermelon yeah and you won't let me out no watermelon shout out but see that's an impression or they'll say i've got something right here i'm going to read it to yahweh well in that service they got something and they don't ever read i want to get the notes you know i'm honest i'm sincere but everybody's different and i know that but i know too the point that i've made if you've never experienced it you you don't know what anybody's talking about that has you know what if you'd never tasted of a watermelon you couldn't tell nobody what it tastes like right but the way we do in our human beings it makes me think of a little child it's an amazing thing to me now it may not be to you but this amazes me i always thought pneumonia was spelled with an n you know it's got it in there but it starts with a p but you know a little kid little jonas you know you can get him to say dog well now he's been around maybe he knows what a dog is or a cat or a cow or something you know he's beginning to get that part in his mind but before he gets it into his mind you can have him saying the word there's no way he could spell it he couldn't look at it written out and he couldn't even see it and be able to to do it it's trained you know constantly over and over well that's what i mean by if you've never experienced it if you've never been healed i mean healed and know it then you can't explain to somebody i mean you can't understand when they explain healing when something comes and just happens and you didn't have nothing to do with it you can't explain that only to a person that has had that to happen to them and i'm not trying to de-christianize nobody but i will say that i wish i could if you're not born again i wish i could preach to you enough that you would find out that you're not because that way you'd have something you could do about it if you keep on believing it saying it whatever without it being a real substance to you you know you've heard me talk about for two years that i and are coming in the message i never counted to new birth even though i was a a deacon for five years uh talked to sunday school classes in in the sunday schools the deacons and wild elders the older people yet i came into the message and i knew that immediately that i didn't have what brother branham was talking about and i set out seeking for it and i was reading constantly and just in a lot of respects just turned my family back and just barely made a living i don't mean i was laid out of work i mean i just went to work that was it but i've always worked i've never been a lazy person i can't do that i can't do it now my wife would say sit down can't do it well if i keep on doing that like terrence says that's keeping him from having to put me in that nursing home you know let me get out now but i've just always been that away you know that if christ is real to you why can't you explain it but yet if he's not real to the other person you can't explain it to him it takes doing and i know see i know what preachers do and i'm sorry i'm just talking okay you ever notice preachers they'll start out and they're looking here and they're looking there and they're looking here and they're looking there later wally look in there look in there yeah what's that what it is they picked up that spirit on that side that's the one they're talking to you know because that side's pulling there that pull is there you know trying to bring out into the open but i've just never been that way i'm just i get a shotgun all across the whole crowd you know i just just preached trying to believe and let it go because i know that if you don't have the experience then you don't understand see then that makes people think that i'm de-christianizing them no i'm trying to help i'm trying to help you paul said have i come become your enemy because i tell you the truth now here's a man that had to withstand a man that opened the doors to the jews and the gentiles right paul had to withstand peter to the face it was over a matter of her life it was a matter of peter not living up the way he should do it but he still had to do it well see you could get exalted on that point but paul never did but peter never was mad at him because he rebuked him he took that and allowed that to be able to build him until he would even say paul does say things hard to understand that some wrestle to their own destruction not a rebuke let's go to open the doors anybody's going to rebuke me there's got to be god himself because i'mma no well you realize how serious it is they even talk about christianity even talk about being a christian you realize when you're talking about that god has come to you and gave you a new birth that either one of the two things is right or it's wrong it's one of the two right there's no gray area you're either lost or saved and in doing that it's so hard to get people to think about the possibility of not being saved you never was there most of you in the baptist church but the baptist philosophy was that one reason they believed in a trinity is if i deny the father i'll deny the son because it says that over in the little john you know and see if i deny that i'm born again then i'm doubting i'm born again and i can't do that i've got to be positive you know that's good that's wonderful but when it's not real and i'm sorry it's the way i think i think most people in this message are just exactly in the same shape positionally wise in their salvation as we were when we were methodists baptist presbyterian pentecostals catholics whatever no brother dale we have the message what does that mean yeah but we're up above them how did we get up there do we still have the same old concept i believe that i'm saved and nobody can't tell me i'm not well by the fact what you just said you're admitting something wrong because you're getting upset about what somebody has said to you right right well you think i wouldn't be in bad shape if i put up with what people said about me i'd really be in bad shape if i took what they said about me you ain't nothing but an intellectual you know that's all right i say amen i'm intellectual that's right now where's your excuse you know if i'm an intellectual where's your excuse because it's got to be intellectual first at least i have the seed in the field if i'm not even saved i have the seed in the field what about people that don't accept no seed in the field well mama said i saved daddy said i say you talk to people and you don't even mention mama daddy uncle aunts brothers sisters nobody and you start talking to them your sister's especially about to hire the dress the clothes you mean my mama wasn't saved you ain't said nothing about mama you ain't mentioned mama see could it be that they see you have obtained something that mama didn't attain unto and if they beginning to worry about mama right you see there's a lot of difference between mental faith and spiritual revelation but it's so close together until we can stay in mental faith and not go on to seek god what is one of my favorite sayings i'd rather go through life seeking for god and come to the end of the road and find out i already had him and to go through life not seeking him and come to the end and find out i don't have him that's a bad situation but the reason i said that about people because well let's use an example i'm not going off on them but bragging on uh the speaker last night at the uh um sterling's graduation i thought he'd done a marvelous job and i did i thought he did a marvelous job now how could you tell him he wasn't saved i mean how could you go to him and tell him he wouldn't say now i'm not saying anywhere there is or not right right right i'm just saying he has a great uplift about him he has a great positive attitude and how could you tell him that he wasn't saved and even he's maybe seen signs wonders had great experiences right and what about it i'm just talking sensibly to you and i about looking at the word of god looking at life and seeing ourselves and just settle the problem we're building a time of saying i'm not supposed to say i'm sick because if i'm sick i'll get sick what am i supposed to say i'm not sick well don't go to the doctor yeah but i'm hurting no wait a minute wait just a minute now you goofed up you said you was hurting your folks say you're not hurting right if you're going to be positive be positive you know like the story was of the pillar you know telling about there was one of them christian science about positive you know went through the long story and the guy was telling the little boy said i said mama's not sick she just says she's sick she's not sick next day you seen him a little boy running where are you going he said i'm going to get the undertaker mama is not dead but she is dead you know she wouldn't confess it right but what about it i remember where i came from do you i remember when i had experiences in the baptist church and seeing god move and seeing things happen i didn't have to come into this message to learn to quit drinking and smoking and running around with women because he wasn't doing that then i always believed if you're going to be a christian you're supposed to be a christian a bad failure i agree but that's what i believed when i come in this message the thing that caught me was the word the man said that wrong down in my heart of the word that he brought amen because i always longed to see god and i heard a man talking about a god that to him was real he was not one of those i hope i'm saved maybe i'm saved i believe i'm saved now get over there i'll know for sure right you ever been there well what about it you've got to have a mental faith before it can become a spiritual revelation because according to the bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word all right now when i talk about it i've come to this i want to read it again when we talk about peter having a substance and losing it but yet still having this confession i'm not talking about the new birth but i don't believe you can be born again and lost i don't believe that now but i believe we can talk about healing and we have to relate it to salvation but we can talk about healing that in healing you can be healed today and die tomorrow with the same thing you believe that that's what your prophet said so that's right because healing is not on an eternal basis healing is a temporary form that's why anybody in the world can receive healing whether they're christian or not brother brown said god said jesus visits the jews every day and heals them and them not even accepting him all right but think i do believe that i said you interrelated i've got it in the second message to do it that i believe you can be justified and your sins forgiven and be lost because you can lose it i believe you can be sanctified and walking truly in it and still be lost but i do not believe you can be truly born again by the new birth of eternal life and never be able to lose that all right but you can be in all the others so we just kind of stay in that realm see then we'll get up into uh substance faith in the others now remember that jesus had not been glorified so the disciples couldn't really have perfect faith if you don't go to the message perfect faith you'll find that statement the little woman there to well are not the wealthy little woman that touches him of his garment i'm sure it's in that message he uses this phrase that she had faith for the time and she was healed faith for the time all right so then those people that were not born again and the people today that are not born again can be healed by faith by believing it's a faith for the time because they look at it they believe it and that to me is what i'm talking about this morning peter had the substance he walked on it but when he stepped back to mental faith it was so close to a spiritual revelation till the only difference you've got i hope you were listening the only difference you've got in peter from here to here here he's got a substance he's walking on water by himself no one holding him but then he loses that substance but he still has his confession and as he does jesus takes his hand and he walks right into the boat that's pretty close isn't it you follow me that's pretty close isn't it the one time he was walking next time he's walking but remember one time he had something he could stand on by himself the next time he had to have help right the difference between mental faith and spiritual revelation is spiritual revelation does not have to have any help you don't have to have no agreement with a doctor for you to be able to say you're healed if god shows you you're healed you don't have to have nobody helping you as a matter of fact it's better off for the doctor to say you're not but it makes you stand we'll get to this about four services down the road substance faith doesn't need anything to put it on you don't have to have when it happened here or it happened there it's done this with somebody else or it's done this before in me you don't have to have that he stands you remember the prophet talking about an eagle said he stands alone said he struts you don't have to have company can we do that but see peter now follow me as we start reading peter could walk himself and they say benny hen is that the right one now it's one bitty hand that stepped out in the mid iron walked off into the i believe it you know i believe it i believe he could do that what if a man can walk on red hot coals and it's not burning i don't have very much problem believing other things right but think about it the difference in peter now he could walk by himself second stage he had to have help substance faith will walk alone whereas mental faith you have to have company something to prop it up with we should write that down because i just saw it see the difference between mental faith and the spiritual revelation then let's read a few things brother ryan said about mental faith and see how close mental faith can be right now if they didn't give you this one most of you don't have these these are the notes from this morning go ahead brother anderson no not backer brother joe never goes back to the number two earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints 1953 614 e73 my brother it's by faith you're saved is that right but listen in accepting of your faith god confirms your faith by the baptism of the holy ghost if you say you believe and you don't get the baptism of the holy ghost then you do not it your faith isn't accepted in the sight of god now is that blown enough maybe some of you think about whether i'm born again or not think about that remember it's not whether you accept him or not it's whether he accepts you but i've been taught all of my life all i had to do was accept jesus christ as my savior well that was good enough for mama and grandmother all of them i think it's time for us to weed out some of that and begin to think about ourselves but watch you say you believe and don't get the baptism of the holy ghost and you do not it your faith isn't accepted in the sight of god you've got a mental faith and in the stead of a heart faith i never noticed he had said those things until i started running this and it surprised me how much he would talk about a heart faith because we know that you know we're not born again and up our head but how many times he would really talk about a heart faith and the old saying is if i could just get that from coming up here about 16 inches down you know into my heart then it could be quickened but look at him he talked about a heart faith you've got a mental faith and in the state of a heart faith that's right when you truly believe god god's under obligation to pour the holy ghost on you and then if he does pour the holy ghost on you you say well i've got the holy ghost well if you do you're bound to believe in the supernatural signs and wonders because you're added to it that's faith all right a heart faith instead of a mental faith and if you've ever had it you know the difference but if you've never had it you don't know well brother dale i don't know whether i'm saved or not there's just no hopes for me i don't know whether i'm predestinated or not that's what they preach you see what these preachers has done with their doctrines they preached a predestinated calvinistic doctrine amen and got the people to where they don't really know what predestination really is if god's seeing me say i'll be saved but if he didn't see me safe i'll be lost well you know what you're saying i'm lost you just said just lost so we solved the problem you lost huh well now if you're lost what are you going to do step one repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ walk into sanctification and believe all the way to the baptism of the holy ghost what are you doing man just follow the steps amen just walk in what god reveals on the brother david the other day we're listening right around we're talking about a little boy 12 or 13 you're a person 12 or 13 years old wondering if they should be re-baptized and he explained it he said you know if he was baptized correctly it's not necessary for you to be baptized again so that's because you baptized correctly said even though you would even go out and go wrong you know and do things he said it's not necessarily that you have to be baptized but then he made an outstanding statement that he's always dwelt within me of knowing what he's taught he said we face any doubt in your mind whatsoever any hindrance whatsoever he said i would go get baptized see if the devil's making you doubt whether you're born again or not we'll have a baptismal service this afternoon well i've been baptized i have two three times one time father son holy ghost one time in the name of the lord jesus christ and one time in the river jordan in israel and if i went back tomorrow i'd go get baptized again in the river jordan we get out of the crowd of 20-something of us there were four of us in the baptismal service the other said we've already been baptized it wouldn't be any doubt in my mind it'd just be i'd like to get back in the water i'm kind of like old brother willie ross he told that time they had got baptized down he was you know brother willie ross from down prairie georgia i think and him and old brother solomon he said they done been baptized named the lord jesus christ and they went up to the tabernacle now that's what he was telling him he said he said solomon did they gonna have a baptismal service this evening he said solomon said well we've done big baptized he said just don't tell nobody he said we're going back again we're going to get some more well anything to do i baptized a lot of you over that was baptized correctly and done all this and the other maybe i even baptized you the first time but if you got any doubt in your mind start from scratch just simply say lord i don't know whether i'm born again or not come and save me let me do this get right why because i don't know what nothing hindered me let's read a little more this is taken from witnesses 1954 e 21. you believe god would say believe you believe god and say you believe god and haven't received the holy spirit there's something wrong with your faith all right because god's under obligation to give every believer that repents and is baptized is under obligation to give you the baptism of the holy spirit and he's more willing to give it to you than you are to receive it that's right so there's something wrong somewhere you just got a mental faith instead of a heart faith where god's under obligation to keep his word heart faith mental faith instead of a heart faith mental faith is so close as i tried to illustrate it of peter being able to walk by himself but then in mental faith he had to have help right if you're born again you don't have to worry about it you know it but you say well brother dale can you have the new birth and doubt yeah i got a faithful saying just once in a while most of your life and know what i mean once every morning and a while every evening the devil tells me i'm lost he'll never talk to you about it no i won't even listen to it no because he's inside of you you're gonna listen to it he's inside of you he's on your side but what about it what about sister lois brother branham's daughter-in-law that received the holy ghost one night and he said the next night she was doubting you need that quote see it's not unbelief to have doubts come in your mind it's not total unbelief to have thoughts come into your mind brother said jesus was even tempted by women so it meant evidently there had to be thoughts come in his mind but yet he was not a sinner oh brother was in atlanta one day and he quoted what brother branham had said you know and i agreed with it he said you can't help the birds flying over your head but said you can keep them from building a nest in your hair now holiday men you know why because i've had a lot of nests try to start in my hair i think maybe most of us have if he ain't telling you that you're lost then that's one sure way of knowing you are lost brother dale you just don't preach like everybody else tell us how good we are and what this isn't yeah because if he ain't telling you you're lost he must be your buddy all right now there's another side to the coin too you know that brother random said where the devil used to tell you you're lost now he will tell you you are saved do you need that quote oh which side we on i'm just trying to be honest i meant for this like i said to be one sermon i was going to get two with it but just think you know mental faith we'll read in a minute where the prophet was talking about what i quoted this morning where he said a musician musician could take mental faith and break glass cheap magician's trick he called it ain't never been able to break a glass i certainly ain't able to holler high enough note to break one or a low enough one you know but that can be done right now if that can be done that means there's something wrong with waves or but that's the other part is getting into the mental faculties but just think about it he said there's something wrong with you he said because god's under obligation to give you the holy ghost if you believe well brother dale i believe yeah i believe i believe everything you say it i don't want you to believe what i say what you believe what he said he said he that it believeth be leave us and his baptized shall be saved he didn't say i believe that was why i read what the disciples said and he said do you now believe you know has it finally dawned on you that i must be something that i've tried all these years to tell you that i am that i'm god in human flesh and they said we believe go ahead to the next one let's just read a little bit of this i won't get but one or two more but this is taken from glorified jesus 1955 to 25 paragraph e17 now if you can look and live when you see the you're the gospel priest on the basis of the word that settles it you're healed right there but you cannot be healed by mental faith you've got to be healed by a real living faith from your heart well do you think that a sinner can have faith for healing yeah brother reynolds said prostitutes walk across the platform and be healed he said in real true christians come across and are not healed you got to be healed by real living faith from your heart no matter how much you worked up up here you know evidently no matter how much you disbelieve up here watch this one no matter if you get worked up it won't work but if you really got it now listen what he's saying here no matter how much you disbelieve up here if something down in down here tells you it's over it's over i turn one paragraph he's covering two things right no matter how much you disbelieve it up here if something down here tells you it's over it's over that's all that settles it there's no more fear at all there's one thing we'll stop in a second nobody could tell you any different you don't know why you believe it right it's not reason it's faith you just believe it and that's the way it takes place you believe it and go on no matter what your senses or sense knowledge would say be all out of reason it was not a reason for abraham and sarah to have the baby but they believed it anyhow it's all out of reason to have a man to stay alive in the belly of a whale but he did anyhow it's all our reason for a man to raise one from the dead but he did it anyhow see yes it is it's true it's not reason it's faith it's not reasoning it's not remember i said i want to talk on that fear we think we have faith but we're afraid we have fear right we have doubts frustrations now wait a minute brother there you just said that the devil could come and talk to us yes he can but there's a difference in the devil talking to you and really being afraid right really having fear if you're at torment right well brother dale when when others preach i feel so saved and you preach i feel so lost well i'm i'm not trying to make you lost but if you lost why wouldn't you want somebody to tell you you're lost how many have you ever been lost in the woods yep maybe i have a dozen when you're lost in the woods you don't know which way to go if you did you wouldn't be lost right i always talked to kids going hunting okay boys what's the way we're going in what's the way the sun is rising and which way if it's right over here you know it's gonna sit over there so if you're going out in the middle of the day don't go right away go the way it rolls you know what i said find you a branch a river or creeks whatever and follow that it may be a long walk but somewhere it's going to cross the highway right but if you're lost you don't know which way to go you just don't even know which way to turn you know what's the best thing to do sit down this set i am let the sun come up and at least you can follow it in one direction but you see if you don't admit you're lost you remember brother branham now tell the story he did he said i'm a hunter lord i can't be lost right he took off a little bit he's right back the same place he finally said lord i'm lost he said i only have one hoax he said that's that wire that we've strung down through and said i'm gonna just put up my hands and walk this away now he didn't know which way to go he was just trusting god right the minute he caught that wire down the hill he went you see when you wanted mitch he lost when you want to make such a great impact on everybody else to talk about your salvation when you want to tell everybody about your great supernatural faith for healing who are you trying to impress you know what we're really trying to do is try to take that fear away remember this story a little boy whistling in the graveyard oh i'm not afraid i'm whistling he's whistling because he's afraid he's talking to a man one day i said it wouldn't matter to me to go out and lay down that graveyard and go to sleep yeah i couldn't go to sleep i gotta go sleep in a graveyard i said why ain't nobody gonna bother you i said it's the one place ain't got nobody gonna come brother harry said when he was in vietnam that's it that's where he went to sleep was in the graveyard because he wouldn't come in the graveyard when he gonna laugh during the graveyard today oh i heard something creaking he's raising over there you know what i mean right we're afraid don't know it that's why you see people come so long and go so far in this message then they drop out because they lose any abilities to be able to function just as a person lost in the woods loses all directional senses you do not know which is which way to go why they call it the end in death walk and why you would do that is unbeknowing to me but you'll start out and turn around right back in the same place look like a while you'd learn to say wait a minute i'm not turning left if anything i'm going right you know but the great thing of mental faith are spiritual revelation what is it let's read this next one uh all right let's go ahead with this one infallible word of god 1950. eight or six one just pray challenge your faith believe it with all your heart jesus said if thou canst believe all things are possible you believe he's raised from the dead now now you now have faith just say lord have mercy on me maybe my faith has been mental faith maybe it's been emotional but now let me calm down and let me believe you lord let me believe you maybe it's emotional you love god don't you well how could you be lost if you love god right don't you love him well how could you be lost if you love him just emotional and it's built on emotions right that's why what was your prophet one thing he was against not against alder calls like everybody says he was against the altar called he didn't believe he gave him until the day he died but what was he against an altar call like we used to do i was 18 years old my brother-in-law got killed in a car wreck my sister came to me in the church and walked down through the church and come to me and she said samuel you got to come to the altar and get saved i said you know jc it was my brother-in-law said you know jc was lost and went to hell well boy that was encouraging you know i've told you before about it i don't care to talk plain i had more confidence in his confessions of anything and yet he was just a person never knew he had any confession of being saved but i had better confidence than i did in her because she could steal the money off a dead man's eye he used to rob her husband out of his billfold and hide everything and do everything and but you know what that done to me that set something in me that i didn't like you ever heard brother brown make this statement sometimes you got to get over the church to be able to get saved do you need that quote i had to get over the church in churchiology where she was telling me that i need to come to hour and be saved because if i did not go into hell with her husband you know one day i come to a conclusion that i was not going to let the church people and doings stand in my way i told you before about it they'd come to talk to me about being safe and i tell them i said live a better life to your deacon board you want to argue with me about it and i did and he lost but you see it's emotional things mama was saying daddy would say you want to go to heaven with mama don't you that's why they'll stay over in that church why because mama was in that church right and they think you got to stay where mama was at emotional thing fear and emotions how strong is your faith look at this next one that we want to talk about for a minute and i'll quit call the messiah 1961 117 e33 here the other night i saw on the telecast of a man with psychic mental faith a glass of water and stood back and kept concentrating on that glass of water till it bursted just by concentration watching that glass of water and the glass cracked and the water run out just pure mental consecration why that's his fibers that's his makeup if he can do that got a power in him by mental thinking that can break a glass of water and him be in the center that shows that there was something made in that man something different about that person he's in a fallen fallen perverted condition but if that man can only get back to god and let god get into him why with that power turned loose of the kingdom of god watch him he didn't have no conductor he talked about the guy you don't break the glass listen to it he was like a shotgun he just splattered everywhere what's he talking about he had no reasons no point of what he was doing to be faith but he just had an ability to believe but if that spirit that's in a man can be converted and put christ in there or he's got to conduct conductor a conductor is a wire that conducts it amen and let a man with that same faith in the conductor of the word of god he can raise the dead cleanse the lepers cast out devils amen he's fashioned like a god he looks like god sure was that's the reason god was in man man was god and this is his offspring man he's only trying to get a hold of man trying to get a man into his hands that man had an ability that man has an ability that other people don't know how most i can't do it ain't never done it what about you well i ain't never tried it i ain't either i don't want to do that because that's making the show you ain't listening this is your prophet telling you about it you mean you can say i don't believe that man breaking glass do you believe hebrews 13 8 do you believe the seals that your prophet brought i've never been to worth it a witchdoctor doctor could drink blood and put a tent or pen on a table and it write an unknown tongue and interpret that of you what your prophet said he had you remember what he said when he faced him one time and they had a piano or something up in the air just floating there with your table or something i probably looked around him said let's see you do it he's not recorded in him did he tried to do it he done one thing he said let me try something he said in the name of father son holy ghost fall down he said that table just stayed up there the name of the roses here and he went through right in a minute he said let me try this he said in the name of the lord jesus christ he said the table went down i believe him don't you i believe it happened so that name of the lord jesus christ was greater than that power they had you remember when he was overseas and the storms came up and the tents was going and he just walked out there and he's peace be still he had a substance didn't he all right but look what he says about it and let's get that in real quick faith is the substance of 1947 7 12 8 37 and he said now you believe with your heart he's talking about the little girl that was real sick they didn't know i believe it was appendix ruptured i think that's right they couldn't carry her her to where that they had to carry her too or whatever he said she's got to have faith immediately what it is just a little background of the story and i said now you believe with all your heart and you prove to me now that you got faith i don't have to prove i've got faith well why is your face read why are you upset why are you coming up with a thought we don't have to go out prove we got faith you know that's right because most of us don't have it but remember even the prophet the devil was moving him and he was getting smaller and smaller and smaller until he said i might as well try this out and he started booing back now you believe with all your heart you prove to me now that you've got faith now you're right directly at that bracelet and it hang in there and midair and you make that bracelet swing around and around in the room and you make it swing back and forth in the room and then stop it and i believe you have faith are you with me she said oh brother branham said my why ask me something like that i said i wanted to see if you had faith i said jesus said all things are possible if you believe now there's another one that i'll be able to i can look it up for you but she winds up and calls it some form of spiritualist ism you know wrong you know he said i know you'd say that look now that's just pure faith friends musicians magicians i'm saying musicians magicians use it many times to play pranks and so forth the same guy he's talking about breaking the glass break burst glasses and things he will if you believe but i'm trying to base your thought on faith so you know what i'm talking about i want you to sit still now so you'll catch this wake yourself up he went on to say he looked on that with his eyes and that bracelet went around and around backwards and forth and stopped right the little girl was healed now he says using it like they did something they could do how close is mental faith one more time i'll say it the difference substance faith peter walked by himself mental faith jesus had to hit him but you know he still walked he still walked think about it get ready for the communion mental faith whether you're talking about salvation or whether you're talking about healing you've got to have some way to anchor your thoughts all right so you anchor your thoughts on the word of god i said i was talking today about everything to go with somebody about brother branham one time were talking about and and billy pauler went to either of them brother branham was talking to her somebody would let me put it right somebody was talking anyway and he said well brother branham you told him he was healed he said what do you want me to tell them the bible says they're healed when i don't want to say something ain't right i'll be a liar don't worry about being one we're born we see we want to make it look so beautiful probably in front of everybody else we try to build up things like you know my comical point you got these weight lifters and things there's more muscles pulled in back problems and muscle pulls in front of mirrors and lifting 500 pound weights so you're only going to do that one time if you do it you get in front of that mirror anybody in here thinks you're ugly now don't raise your hand because i will call you a liar you look in the mirror and you don't believe you're as ugly as everybody else is ugly and no matter how old are you getting how more ugly you get you just lose your eyesight right mental faith now this is my life statement i don't like to talk this way but i like to tell the truth about it anyhow i am responsible for that part i believe the biggest portion of this world of over 500 million more than that now don't tell them what it used to be the catholic church used to have 500 million professing believers we don't put a number just say the biggest portion of this world claims to be christians one way or the other you know a lot of flim flames it's like that man told me at that time he said you mean to tell me he said there's 500 billion catholics that's that's what they say he said you mean to tell me that there's 500 million are wrong and you're right i didn't say that but the bible did that's what i told you mr bible because i followed him out what about billions of christians around the world in the biggest portion of our mental faith they spend their lives that's what i'm talking about spend their lives working serving a god that they do not know and haven't had a personal experience with him yet they'll die for what they believe now come on i'm not going off on nobody right but is it right when i say it is the biggest portion of the world going to heaven just because they say they believe in jesus christ is that all we've got a confession remember your prophet just said if he don't accept your confession you do not have the baptism in the holy ghost brother dale all you've done to me has made me the word i don't really know well we got that song that's right we got that solved now let's move on let's see god yes but if i admit i'm lost i'm lost oh god i don't know i don't know what to do i'm sorry have i become your enemy because i told you the truth it's what i've said this morning this afternoon the truth i'm not talking about my antics and ways and characters and things but it's what i've said to you about mental faith comparing it to spiritual revelation is it true and the prophet said in biggest portion we'll get to that later of our faith is mental faith but brother dale those people love god to do that rhetoric said people have a portion of these virtues and not even be born again there's some good people in this world there's good people just you know make you and i ashamed of ourselves but does that change god's word what about it a stand as we go into the communion i hope you understand me listen i'm talking about a positive faith a positive attitude talking about what god's word says and just asking a simple question do we know a man that did not have the new birth i've had to know certain lies didn't get that job he said i know my redeemer liveth you know what brother brown said he said i like that positive statement could i know doesn't mean you guess i hope it means something has went from this head down into your heart and you're speaking back out from there to say i know and there's nobody can take anything away now the kitchen the announcement to the sisters the kitchen you know sisters will be using the kitchen area room for foot washing to make it more disorders more comfortable for some with limited mobility they will unlock the doors when they are finished so don't try to go into dinner also following today's foot washing we will discuss a plan for activities and fellowship opportunities for the father's day weekend in the same room stay if you're interested you understand what it's saying the foot washing is going to be in the kitchen area because it'd make it more comfortable all right then after that there will be a meeting of the sisters someone talked about doing some things while we were gone on the uh men to their doings or something they've talked about doing some things and they'll be sitting and discussing that so brothers keep the kids outside stay outside until the doors are unlocked okay everybody got it all right let's go into her scripture first corinthians for i've received to the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you it's due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dude is often as you drink it in remembrance of me or as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoe the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep where we would judge ourselves we should not be judged i love this one but when we are judged we're chasing to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world we're for my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hungry let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come we come to a wonderful situation time communion i'm talking about your baptism with the holy ghost and that little brother said nobody had a right to take communion it wasn't born again well that's your choice you know if you do it i don't tell the deacons to pull back because they think somebody doesn't have it that's none of their business it's between that person and god all right but we do put it that way and believe it but let's just take a few moments to tarry one for another praying and you pray especially for me because i need it more than ever whatsoever in this life and day so let's pray just have your way lord down as we're going into the further part of the service we love you and we thank you sanctify the people that we may all be able to receive this that you have ordained for us to do we love you and we thank you in jesus name the bible said he took bread and blessed it lord jesus we ask you to breast bless this bread it's been made for this purpose today and now we come to that part so we ask you to just sanctify us and let this little people bread piece of bread just be a symbolic form but yet let it have a deep meaning in our heart we love you and we thank you in jesus name you know we believe in the word of god and believe i'm trying to do what it says but you know then people will turn right back around and say well why have you got to do this well you got to do that well the bible says to do it well i don't think it's that way i think it's it's from a sincere heart yeah i don't think your heart's too sincere but all that does because it hurt feelings and all of that but what about it what do we think about this part of being a christian of salvation well brother daley didn't understand these things down through time yeah but now it's come to a point that we're responsible to know these things because the end has come upon us and then we must know the truth and we thank god for the truth right father we ask you to sanctify this wine that's made for this purpose today lord just let it be as we eat a little piece of bread and drink the wine then it'll be blood cells in our body later on but yet let us see what these things mean this is not your blood but it's a symbol of it but a great symbol is so for us to take until you come we believe you and we thank you we committed to you now sanctify the wine and the partakers in jesus name amen come morning i walk by the river the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected and i question oh father how long then i take one more look at mountain free and it gives me the strength to go on come morning by the river i rest me the ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me what about those disciples when they first heard the lord jesus and he said this is my blood this is my body i'm sure they didn't understand evidently they never had real good clarity of all of this peace because like i said even those who experienced the lord jesus there and those who were with him and heard him and talking they were never chosen to explain the communion but the apostle paul that come along later one born out of due season he was chosen to explain the communion he could go back in the old testament bring it down peter didn't say now wait a minute paul wait a minute now i opened the doors to the gentiles and the jews i think ought to be the one to explain it he didn't peter june evidently he didn't have a clear understanding i don't believe they thought they were supposed to eat his body and drink his blood now we're not that far off i just don't think they understood do we really understand what these symbols you know well why do y'all put so much emphasis upon on the uh what a baptism or something because the word says it right and why would you emphasize it you know father son holy ghost is not right it needs to be done in the name of the lord jesus christ well you know if that's not true what about the rest of it it might not be true either hebrews 13 8 might not be true but if i believe hebrews 13 8 why wouldn't it want to be in the name of the lord jesus christ why would it not want to be sacred you remember the one brother branham when they were getting ready to baptize and some people was walking down into the water one of the ladies said oh you're going down and be dunked today see turn around told her said go back you're not worthy he sent her back says you're not worthy why because duncan or ducking or whatever wouldn't to be done if sincerity right everything should be sincere in god i know i like to life and talk and do yeah but when it comes to this word i'm sincere ain't no life and going on about this word i'm sincere i do that to keep you from drying up so much to where you won't be listening because it's hard to listen when your face is drawn down when you're going up at least your ears are open think on these things let's protect together you can be seated for a minute we're finishing up going to john for the reading and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas's carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he risen from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and dirty himself after that he poured water into a base and then began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord does thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do i know it's not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter says unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i was thee not thou has no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus says unto him he that is wash and he does not save to wash his feet but he's clean every whip and you're clean but not all praying you who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so therefore excuse me so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what i have done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master and wash your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet but i've given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do then let's stand together father we just ask you to be with us now as we're going into the foot washing and as the sisters go downstairs for their time together lord and we pray that you'd bless each one we love you and we thank you forgive our sins make us clean in you lord and help us to walk in your love in jesus name amen you dismissed you
