you emptied out so you can get full again get a double portion today so good to be here all announcements have been made so we will not spend any time on that let's turn to revelation 6 and get started I hope this morning was clear and what we needed something that will help us along the way no ma'am it's just like some I said just gets good and gooder and really you know that's what we live off we live off a revelation sure we have to have natural food and sure we like worship anyone but we live off Revelation in the end time we really live live off Revelation because that's that's what's coming forth that's the box that we're supposed to be and we're supposed to understand this part that we're supposed to play all the others have played their parts all the others have finished their course they've they fought the good fight and they're resting waiting on you and I and to finish this fight and get this thing over with so we can come back for a millennium for a thousand years or just resting and man and I may know about the future home I'm talking about just getting to the millennium so we can all just rest for about a thousand years you know and just let everything unfold the way it unfolds so but we got to press the bottle now so revelation 6 verse 7 if they'll pull that up we'll get started this afternoon try to move into now I want to the title is now I am the resurrection in the life part 1 I thought we might get it done today but I don't think we can we there's too many parts to that so we're gonna stay on this until we have a resurrection and come ahead I hope so but let's bow our heads the Lord Jesus thank you for giving us another day an opportunity to speak to the best of the best the cream of the crop the number one concern of the bridegroom is the bride Lord we're here today Lord is just ones to hear from you Lord not to hear all the chatter that goes on in the world and all the things on the news and the weather and know we're here to hear from you Lord because whatever you say is eternal whatever you say has already been tried and proven and it is put into motion and a bride in the end time probably give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our sins Lord bless the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor father just be with us today if there be any sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and deliver us from destruction so Lord we pray that you would anoint us all anoint us all for this journey Lord to take us to that last push to get out of here because I believe that we are looking at the restoration of all things father just be with us and take care of us in Jesus name we pray amen and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see I looked and behold a pale horse in his name that sat on him was death now remember he was death during the whole time when he started he antichrist movement that was dead anything and tire against the word is dead so it started with death but it had come to where that the fourth church age I mean the fourth combat beef was the one that was going to give him a name and we'll talk about that in just a few minutes because look we got to know what we're fighting we got to know what we're fighting we're fighting death so we got to know what it is first you've got you you know if a guy's got a certain punch or if a guy's got a certain way of doing things football or anything you always look at the weakness of the team that you're playing you see the tendencies and you see what well the devil is pretty predictable so we ought to be able to understand though that one thing's for sure if it's anti-christ it's anti word and it's dead alright it's not coming to death it's already dead alright when Lucifer got cast out of heaven that was it because God told him said you were made perfect until iniquity was found in you and then that point from that point forward he was dead now who gives him the power we do we give him the power God permits him to work among us to try us but we're gonna come out as pure gold so that's what the Bible said and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and beheld a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word let's go ahead and read a few more scriptures while we're in it let's go to Joel to we were talking about this morning we've been reading this for a few Sundays and I want us to understand like I said this morning this is talking to you this is not a prophecy now it is a reality we have had the former rain no doubt we've had the former rain it came as a teaching rain through eleven hundred and something sermons from the prophet of God and then that was the teaching rain that came down on the people to teach them something but now that's okay if you plant you know you can you can plant a garden and it can come up like we were talking about this morning and it can grow and it can mature but what good is it unless you harvest it what good is that you can have oh I've got a thousand acres of corn well a year later you're gonna say I got a thousand acres of corn no something's gonna happen to it you got to harvest that corn it's not gonna feed nobody amen so what same way with this when we come here and we see that be glad you children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain you the former rain and the latter rain in the first month so we see this coming in a very short period of time so the former rain is the teaching rain we've had that and we're having this continually now but it came to us in one rain the prophet of God rained eleven hundred and something sermons down on us and then the teaching rain and now from that there's going to be a harvest and the harvest is what the rapture all right so the harvest is the rapture but there's a lot goes on in between you've got a harvest at first there's got to be a resurrection or a harvest of the earth before we take a rapture and then we've been talking about that I'm not worried about a rapture anymore I don't even I don't even think about it well I think about something that's not going to happen unless this happens first a man I mean a German chocolate cake uh-huh uh-huh now y'all will get happy there - tail wagging say Amen hallelujah now write German chocolate shake about 20 of you in so maybe I'll mention German chocolate cake in about 20 minutes and it'll wait some of you up but my mom can make the best German chocolate cake in the world but you know what she has to get this ingredient and that ingredient and this ingredient and she has to put it together and she has to baking in an oven other than that you know what I would not eat Germans honking Kate if it wasn't put together because all it is is what powdered this powdered that an egg flour thank you coconut I finished coconut caramel chocolate nuts you know scatter at coconut Oh cocoa all that scatter up have you ever eat tried to eat cocoa you're making a point here you know cocoa is horrible but in the German chocolate cake it's really good so it takes somebody to cook this all up take this and this and this and cook it together and make one beautiful cake and that's what I believe is happening now that we're bringing we've had the formal ain't rain and we it's raining now but it's raining to bring a harvest alright and the harvest is all of us and the floor shall be full of weed and the facts shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm the counter pill their pommel were my great army which I sent among you and that's the four beasts that eat it down all right and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied one piece of German chocolate cake just make me mad but a whole cake a big one sister Rebeka up she said ah yes a big piece of German side you know I want the cake rockin go get it when I want it you know if it was one little piece of cake I'll never forget I'm gonna tell you this story for a point brother Keith Reed Danny you got tic tacs in your pocket figured you did hold them up this is not let's make a deal this some of your old ones remember what I'm talking about see that right there I gave one of those to brother Keith Reed one time when I went over to Jamaica that's only like what there's about thirty so 40 maybe in the whole thing what he done was I saw him like eight months later I went back to Jamaica he had not even finished the thing he said I think of you and I'll take one and I'll eat one when they meet me and Daniel eat one and the day sometimes I eat two or three in the day but you see what I'm saying he let it last because it was good so that's what we're doing now we're letting it last out with letting that German chocolate cake last oh sure we want to you know gobble it up but gods give us 60 years of eating the Germans Anka gate so we can just keep eating we'll yell one day though one day that Germans Hawking cake is going to disappear and it's going to disappear into people and then we're gonna get out of here and ma'am but we got to get the people out of the ground first and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously y'all will get nothing but German coffee cake on your mind today and you won't listen to nothing I'm saying and my people shall never be ashamed because some of your not like Germans okay who does not like German chocolate cake backsliders they held their hands up too fast now look but gods give us this great we call it a seven course menu right which he give us the seven seals in the seven Church ages and he gave us the 11-hundred sermon but it's gonna take somebody's like I saying this morning and I'm not being I'm not being mean I'm just telling you how people are gonna miss this thing you're not going to take a tape recorder out into the cemetery and mash play and expect the resurrection a resurrection comes from a live ministry a live group of people have to stand the angels were standing in them in the tomb and said why seek ye the living among the dead in other words what these dead people are not proclaiming the resurrection it's a live people that proclaims the resurrection it's a lot of people that gets those people out of the ground amen it's nonsense of the other one never gonna get anybody out of the ground it hasn't produced anything and it will never produce unless it comes from you it will have to come from some voice live voice alright let's turn right here to John 12 we read it this morning jesus answered and said the hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified now remember he referred to himself as the Son of Man cool that's what we're gonna talk about today in part is the son of man just for a little while then alright because look the Son of Man look look at me the Son of Man is the Box that you and I today in the end time you and I have to understand what the Son of Man is that's our box like I read the quote this morning that's our anointing to this age is to know what the Son of Man is know who he is Noah's characteristic and know that he's here amen because without him being here he's the one that says I am the resurrection and the life and then Martha didn't say it Peter didn't say it Paul didn't say it jesus said it the Son of Man all right but he had to be spoken through somebody you know I'll prove it to you brother branham said it so I'll just let you hear him saying but jesus said verily I saying to you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die now I just fall into the ground it's got to die all right member who I said Jesus his body laid in that tomb in Jerusalem did there was no life in that body none zero and if it hadn't have been for the scripture about corruption it would have corrupted because it was a human body but that human body man stood there one day at the tomb of Lazarus bring the next one up but if I die bringing forth life John 11:21 then martha sent in jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died but i know that even now what something to look she look what she's confessing and watch her lose it to scriptures he just took her to to lose it but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee now she didn't believe that Jesus said that brother she arrives the end months it says I know that he's arrives in the resurrection at the last day she just proved right then she didn't believe who he was at the moment Martha said I know that he should see that's like us we're like well the resurrection you know that's that's coming up it is for another group no here's your box this is my box I have a resurrection box so that's what we're declared to declare were to declare the resurrection amen and we'll get into that next Sunday I want you to kind of think on the sign of the Son of Man will read a little bit of it this afternoon at the very end but the sign of the son of man not the sign of the son of God the sign of the son of man all right jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha sending him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection the last thing in other words she was saying I believe what you just said but I don't really believe what you just said but you know what she done she put her own interpretation to it thy brother shall rise again Jesus was saying right then Martha was saying O Lord I know he's going to come up in the resurrection that's not what Jesus was talking about because what jesus said unto her and the resurrection and the life right I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth on me though he were dead you got to be dead to have a resurrection amen you got to have a death before you can have a resurrection we're talking about this morning death before life you got to have a death before life even in the spiritual room you got to have a death before you have a life and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this believe it's now this amen I am the resurrection and the life now remember then we come to the break into the seals and we won't show this chart up again but the breaking of the seals then takes us to that point to where that resurrection has to happen and I said it has to happen because once everything is lined up the resurrection has to take place and then and then when the resurrection take place then the rapture has to take place you see what I'm saying so let's get the first first let's get the resurrection because look in this fourth seal death has to be destroyed listen before before that fourth seal broke even brother branham later on after he said after he preached that he said now you know remember he preached why I'm against organized religion in 1959 but in the opening of the seals which I believe was the fourth seal because it named death he knew where death was coming from it was coming from them denominational ideas and all that the people ran and then he says now I know why I was against that thing why because he can name it by dirt listen let me make it as strong as I make it John Wesley stood and preached a Trinitarian doctrine baptizing name of Father Son Holy Ghost is that right he was church aged messenger that was his box but that was death that was death that wasn't life over if father son Holy Ghost was created out of the pits of hell how is it that eternal he can't be but God allowed it or permitted it because John Wesley was preaching sanctification of the vessel Luther justification of the vessel sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost they have their time to work in and that's all because they truly were preaching life but it was death now because it was named now in this four churches with the Eagle anointing we now see that what they called life is now death to me and you that all right that's why we got to come up we got to keep lifting up higher because John Weston can never bring anything out any anything in John Wesley's message though he was a powerful man great man just a cleat it gave me a book to read him or read about cuz I'd never read about John Wesley I want to read about him but a powerful man but nothing he preached brought a resurrection oh sure a resurrection of out of out resurrection of coming up out of dead works and all those things but remember if we took his message and just late on it it be dead does amen so death has to be destroyed then in the word that's already John Wesley didn't read another different Bible than we did he read the same Bible but he didn't it wasn't required a resurrection in his time it wasn't required a resurrection in Pentecost it was declared now a resurrection in this end time amen a resurrection has to take place then the rapture takes place on that fourth seal but the rapture cannot take place without a resurrection first in man so that's why I'm saying I'm not belittling the rapture but the rapture is kind of a culmination of all these other things happen but all these other things got to happen first you can't just say oh I'm going into rapture well if you got the resurrection sign in your life have you got the resurrection sign in your life someday you better so then a resurrection is what we need we need to look at the what the sign of the son of man the resurrection sign German chocolate cake yeah there you go Timbo wake up Jim all the rest of y'all we got German chocolate cake go through the recipe it'll keep you awake just say chocolate most of you'll start shouting yeah help us on so the breaking of these seals though is the restoration of all things everything has to come back to the Gentile dispensation you hear what I'm saying because I that's my boss my box is not in Israel what happens there is rose okay and it will happen to me because I'm spiritual Israel but my box is take a physical resurrection and a physical coming of age and a physical leaving here so that God can go to the Jews and do what he's supposed to do in the box of the two witnesses 1260 days right there and then you know what they disappear God watch the earth off and we all come back you know what we can shout about that that's okay but let's find out what we need to do now to get us there if we don't know what we're doing now we sure not going to be there but we will know because it's a promise that's a sign of the Son of Man will come back the resurrection sign got it for next Sunday we won't read it this Sunday but the resurrection sign had to come from the son of man he's the only one that's took a resurrection and a body change now there's been other resurrections okay don't catch me now there's been other resurrection Lazarus when he said I am the resurrection and the life and he brought Lazarus back to life every what lifetime that Lazarus lived he died and then even Abraham when Abraham got his body changed which is what we're supposed to to be our body change and be our example he died you and I that's not true for us when we take a resurrection Jesus when he stepped out of that tomb he didn't die twenty years later of 50 years later he's still alive they matter he is absolutely standing in an immortal body the body he lived on this earth in I said the body he lived on his earth in he's standing in it today but listen brothers and sisters you are the restoration of this whole thing it does not hinge on no other person but you know one God can't trust his word with nobody else but it's bride that's all I didn't say that I'm just telling you what he said hey you know what that's great because you know what then we can focus in on our box resurrection listen if it don't happen soon if they're accurate I mean for resurrect you don't have them soon there's some of you that we're gonna have to say we're waiting on the resurrection right no brother you ain't no more one than I am I could drop dead in two seconds but leave it at that who's that oh you're the rest you are the resurrection so you are the restoration which will bring on a resurrection so the resurrection is sign has got to come into a group of people we saw it just and we'll talk about it more next Sunday we saw it in listen brother Brown said what you saw in part you'll see in fullness one day that was part that was part here what I'm saying those prayer lines and all those thousands and hundreds of thousands of healings and and eyeballs being restored that's what he was talking about that was in part Amen but what was he prophesying of a fullness to come where brother BAM said limbs would be restored listen those Morton limbs got to be restored in you and I abraham's lamb wasn't restored his whole body was restored amen but you know what it takes the same power God doesn't have to you know how we do we have to we have to kind of work the motor up and you know God don't have to work the motor up no more to destroy this whole world than it does to give you eternal life it doesn't matter to him he's not nervous when this happens he has no ups and down he's just Lee he knows what's gonna happen so he's just he even kill you and I need to know if you and I know what's coming we had a prophet come and tell us what's coming every step like Bernie says we have read tomorrow's headlines today we know what's coming now we might know not names and dates but we know what's coming amen but we did not know let's go to the next one we did not know about this spiritual death until this seal broke because remember he fooled the whole world Satan fooled the whole world at Nicaea bringing in the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism remember folks that never come from God eternal hell never came from God all those false doctrines listen you can't put that on God but he allowed it because he knew he had to restore listen I know it's bad to be sick I've never been real sick like maybe brother digging something like bailout something y'all been pretty sick right I know that I did too but to be real sick and then all of a sudden you come out of it and you get better even in that little small that we just talked about right now there's a glory in them amen but that just speaks like brother Brown said this is just a little part what you see in part you'll see in the fullness one day when there's no ebb and flow in our bad days and good days we're coming to a resurrection to where we may have sure we may have hard times but man to see Robert Tatum come through the door though the Gary brother Rita Marlowe all the ones and I don't want to leave anybody out but just to keep going through your mom and dad all the what a joy don't you think Germans have UK times a hundred but you know what it's going to do though this is what I'm just telling you this is what I see we may get to our darkest time and that may be the time that God brings in through the door and then buddy you talk about a spark so we know though we ain't got but 3040 days because remember we've which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder we'll get into this in a couple of weeks those which are asleep for the trumpet of God will sound and they shall rise what first and then we which are here in other words will be changed so we're going to be that's see that's what always bothered me is talking about this morning about Jesus or about me you say well the resurrection is in me resurrection didn't mean you know I mean as bad as you feel brother dick I don't care how many of these right here you got the resurrections in me you got that right brother it sure is what are we looking at we're looking at what symptoms and circumstances Jesus probably didn't feel good that day in his humanity he'd been four days journey and he cried afterwards so he probably had been having a hard time but he stood and he says I Know Who I am I am the resurrection and the life so it may be that we get down to a low point but then we just one day something inside catches the hold and we say hey you know what Robert Tatum I just man brother Tatum always money and he just I just call his name first but you know what I'm tired of missing Robert Tatum Lord says I'll give you the desire of your heart you just speak it and I said Robert Tatum walked through that door he'll give you a desire of your heart every one of us are connected with somebody's past home so what if you call their name because you're connected to them and then they walk through the door would that be too far-fetched no that's German chocolate cake let's rename this sermon all right everybody okay but this has become a reality this is not a fantasy world that we're living in God has never been a fantasize er he's never been an imaginary he never whatever God puts in his mind he don't imagine it because you're knocking say well I imagine tomorrow I'm gonna get up and I don't know what I'm gonna eat God doesn't do that well soon as he thinks and it comes to pass and it's perfect you say well that's God I thought he lived in you hmm huh I thought he lived in you and we supposed to let him be in control amen spoken words regional seed spiritual death that was both physical and spiritual with Eve who were talking about this this morning but I will read it again first at any time I told you and asked you this morning sister to forgive me so I can mention it anytime a woman takes the wrong step I'm talking about Christ in the bride now but anytime a woman takes the wrong steps she has to first receive it in her mind it was not a sex act in the garden that killed mankind Eve had to first accept it in her mind because look Mary had to first accept it in her mind Mary said be it unto me according to thy word and something clicked she was pregnant no act at all hmm no act at all she actually had to wait about thirty days to figure out she's pregnant so she was believing through that time had to be because she lost her confessions you and the guy amen mmm so that's why you and I 50 years we got to hold this confession and then that the property God's right what he said was right he was a true prophet not a false prophet he was somebody that the only way we only get to God is through that man we couldn't understand without it but anytime a woman takes the wrong steps she has to first receive it in her mind right some slicker has to persuade her and she listens to against her own better judgment than the act is committed so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and in the womb of her mind she doubted God's Word then came the actual act all right and the only way that we can ever be born again listen to this is what was from I this morning you said well brother Dale has been preaching on this for a year he could have read this one quote and be done with it if we'd believe it but no we have to get all the German chocolate cake recipe together all right and the only way that we can ever be born again first in the womb of the mind receive the word and then the Spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life brings walk to life the word that you help to me that's the simplest thing in the world why do people have to come complicate this whole thing just born with this and you didn't have that news always was it I think he just told us what it is right there in the womb of your mind you got to receive the word then the Spirit comes on top of that and brings it to life that's where the new birth comes from because your first life is worthless you sign you first let your mom and Daddy brought you here by an act and you're dying just what is but on the new birth born again the Spirit comes on top of that what the word and brings it to life there you are that's what does it that's the real gospel teaching brother I believe st. Paul was here he'd teach the same thing you wouldn't have to shout German chocolate cake de pollo I promise number one me probably number two unveiling of God let's read some of these that were read this morning for the sake of of repeating ourselves they spiritually die now this is a spiritual veil now what's he talking about the unveiling of God he's talking about the natural veil in the temple there was a natural veil in the temple but now it's the spiritual veil they keep walking right on in it cuz look and you don't have to go behind the natural veil it's a spiritual veil all right they keep walking right on in behind there you can tell them oh I know I know but but you see go ahead that's all right it only speaks you remember the last plague in Egypt was death before the Exodus now it's telling us what the life's plates going to be because remember the Exodus is type of us getting out of Egypt amen alright the last plague on earth a spiritual death before the Exodus then they'll be cremated and turn back to the dust and the righteous will walk out upon their ashes but the last thing is spiritual death what rejecting the word alright now look let's look on the fourth seal I haven't read this one before let's read this one I like this and they look what happened this is where the death come from the fourth seal 1963 notice it's Christ the antichrist refuses the true somebody say that word for me the trick that was weak the what doctrine you saw I thought that was brother Browning's doctor not something are we foolish it's our doctrine it's what we live by and brother Brown says the Antichrist refuses the true bride doctrine therefore he takes his own bride down and builds her up under a creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her denomination she gives birth to other denominations that's quoted in this holy scripture gives birth to daughters he's talking about revelation and she don't she becomes just like her mother natural world we denominational opposing the spiritual bride comma the word so the spiritual bride in the end time is what the word and then the spiritual bride in the end time is a word and we have connected ourselves to that so that makes us the Word made flesh and then that all right all right now let's go to I will restore we'll read it this morning but let's read this one right here cuz I didn't read him this morning for sealed now you see he was cast out of the earth and becomes incarnate as the Antichrist spirit become incarnate into a man that man changes from one thing to another from an antichrist spirit to a false prophet and then to the Beast comes then the Beast comes into him just exactly like the church growth his church went from Antichrist the false prophet in the great age to come the Beast that is to rise up so the church comes the same way through justification see if you take the seals you have to take the plan of redemption to understand the opening of the seals is not to understand the Antichrist and all that it's to understand Jesus Christ and what he's already brought because how many times did I read y'all while we were going through the first part of the seals where brother Brown says this is a book of redemption the book that was open and the book that was in the hand of the owner was what not a book of the devil it was a book of Jesus Christ the redemptive plan when when when Jesus Christ took that book in Revelations 5 that wasn't a book to reveal the devil that was a book to reveal you cuz you were in the book remember it was a book of redemption so these seals have two parallel Redemption he seals our Redemption but through justification sanctification and baptism the Holy Ghost as Christ being in the people just exactly and he's got the anti-type off over there see the top of it rather there he is just exactly that's him kicked out of heaven talking about Satan alright so now let's read Ezekiel again but let's condense it down a little bit because I want to make a comment right here afterwards I won't let you let I'm gonna let brother branham I found a quote just a few minutes ago and we inserted it it's the one that y'all got extra just a few minutes ago Ezekiel 37 says this is about the valley of dry bones we were talking about this morning for those of you who weren't here you got bones you got sinew you got skin you got life so there's your four stages to fourth and I'm gonna let brother Brown tell you that you mouth all I said that but I'm gonna let brother I'm tell you then then said he unto me prophesy into the wind prophesy son a man son of man say to the wind dust that the Lord God come from the four winds four winds lying ox man and eagle old breathe and breath and breathe Oh breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded now I believe brother Branham prophesied as he was commanded because brother brown was a prophet that makes him a prophesy he prophesied what he was prophesying to me and you people to come that's what people don't get brother Branham was preaching to that overlap coming out of Pentecost they had their box but their boss wasn't resurrection their box was live a good Christian life so what brother Bram said on the sixth seal he said it's gone from you it's not for you but you do have a box he said now you go on and live a good simple Christian life you know what he said told them to do that live a good simple Christian life because remember the seals are really not to show you how to live a good Christian life there'll be millions of people bride bride they'd never heard of seal priest Paul never heard him Paul was dead before John even went departments but you and I I hope you get this you and I it was commissioned for us to see this that's why all the prophets wanted to see this day they could just barely see a little piece of it but it was me and you they were looking at that ain't Germans on the gate that's something far greater so I prophesied as he commanded me now we know that but who was he breathing on he's breathing now he's breathing the breath of life into those dry bones right now and they lived and stood up upon their feet we're not gonna take a resurrection laying down the resurrection is upright just like this all right an exceeding great army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel now remember we're spiritual Israel so we get this first and then behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God behold O my people I will open up your grave and cause you to come out of your graves and bring you into the Land of Israel and you shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves all my people and brought you out of your graves and she'll put my spirit in you and you shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall you know that I the LORD have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord now let's read what brother Branham said about them restoration of the bride tree I just found this a few minutes ago and I want you to lift it right here they're got five oh nine four four killers took it pommel worm locusts caterpillar and I can't remember the cankerworm I hate them kangaroo horrible four killers took it for messengers destroyed it four messengers of death took it away in dogma see brother Branham now he's telling it heat it at this point the seals weren't open it's right before right or that's that yeah it was right before 63 he didn't know to call it death there was not a name for it he called it Dogma four messengers of righteousness restore her back again line ox man and eagle prophesy Son of Man now watch he's going right back to the scripture we read can these bones live wish we had time well you know what we got time now I got it wrote down here but I have to miss that prophesy can these bones live watch the four stages of that coming fourth of that church right watch the four stages of Ezekiel's dry bones coming forth but the life only come not when the sinew skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of life that's when come back that fourth message of life I will restore say oh I like it cool how Oh glory praise be to God the forth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification Brotman what have we been talking about the whole time in the seal justification Saints catching baptism the Holy Ghost and then the word being made flesh ghost he's got to come to fore he's got to come to for justification brought back to pulp sanctification brought back to bark doctrine of holiness walk bought breakfast what brought back to leaf Pentecostal what is it Pentecostals leave clapping their hands joy oh they did they had a great time God was with those people but when they said in the womb of their mind said this is it we don't handle more of that see that swing guard said all right I've had enough of that I'm going on he didn't say that was false he said I've had enough of that and I'm going on there was no resin you know what you know what God is looking for you know what God is looking for he's looking for somebody to believe that they have the resurrection inside of them he has not found it until today he looked in the Pentecostals he said aha great great great oh man why did y'all do that of course he knew from the fountain here's the world they were going to but you know God is long-suffering if God went long-suffering why didn't he just cut this whole thing off faster but will he give up his long suffered with the Pentecostals and finally they said this is it God sent a prophet on the scene they rejected him well when they rejected the Prophet guess what God moved on amen what brought back the leaf Pentecostals joy rejoicing Pentecost what the fourth was the word itself a person the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign I love those two words the resurrection signed that Christ is finally listen after justification has been planted sanctification has been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap on the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap what is it the Holy Ghost bunch let's all say it together the ones who are awake the Holy Ghost bunch the rest of you can think of Germans talking gate what is it that Holy Ghost bunch being holed out that's what's happening now so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture but now bringing him back it's the resurrection son so there has to be the resurrection before then be that rapture up there where the justified sanctified into baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the Tree of Life is growing again and then because look when it restores it restores that we got we don't we don't we don't we got to go back the life went down in the roots you just see anything but a stump you just saw a stump sticking up but when that thing's restored it comes back to the tree that's what he was saying the pulp the bark the leaves the life that's what he's talking about The Tree of Life is growing again I like that that kind of wraps up everything we've been talking about for the past past month I just found that like you know what I punched in I punched in with us the resurrection sign because he said resurrection signed about 30 times in the in the in his sermon but I love that right there the tree of life is growing again it's not that he's gonna restore people hey the the restoration is almost over the restoration is almost over it's not coming it's almost over a man and I please hope we don't miss it and that's okay but you know I like that song but the Israel can't do one thing until we get out of here the resurrection sign has come to us and you and I are gonna have to make that thing manifest not by just signs and wonders of of healings of cancer and we've seen that in this building we've seen the dead come to life all those different things we've seen that but that just speaks of us being in line to say Robert Tatum I want to see you again come through that door that okay so now let's get to just about 10 or 15 minutes of this last part and we'll speak on it next Sunday on the son of man so that's what we're going to start them because look if the son of man is not here we have no resurrection that's why he had to come back in the end time as the son of man now brother branham being the son of man but the son of man ministry through brother Branham all right cuz he's gonna even tell you I'm gonna read a quote here in just a minute where he's telling them that they're getting it all messed up somewhere Oh an anointed ones 1965 said it seems so hard for you hard to get them separated and they still do because gee people brother Branham was not God never will be God never has been God but he was used by God in the most marvelous way that that I guess if if I stood stayed around him for 10 or 15 years I think he was him because what about a human man that could walk up and tell you the thoughts you had what you did yesterday and what's gonna happen tomorrow they say look you're you know he just touched people he said you know once you your grandpa he he had epilepsy in them cuz your son's got epilepsy just close your grandpa had epilepsy neither grandpa had been dead hundred years that was close but it was the sign that we supposed to see remember it was not in the years of all that that was the preparation to get people to turn and get their attention right but it was the message of the son of man that was brought Martha said under him I know that he shall rise again now now wait a minute who's talking here Jesus now Jesus at that point right there is the Son of Man he's not the son of God distance he's the son of man right he was a word made flesh standing on the earth in this dimension okay now we know for a fact that the Son of God was working through him you can't get away that's the father that's the son of God I'll let brother Ram explain it you look across out if you want to him will let him I'm already too in a minute Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this believe us now this cuz you know what let me let me just be real hard whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die somebody's gonna make that man face you know why because jesus said it he said it and I can read it I just got to start believing it there all right but you know who said that the son of man I'm trying to the son of man said that we know what was the son of God but that wasn't a son of God dispensation at that time that was the son of man that was in the beginning was the word the Word was with God we're gonna we gonna read it in the minute okay let's go to the next one Luke 17 very familiar likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted a bill that sounded like today but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day not days day when the Son of Man is revealed so he can walk among you for a long time and then be revealed that all right and be revealed because he walked for three and a half years with the disciples and the only time he was ever revealed to them was the day of Pentecost and that was under the Son of God dispensation amen mm-hmm number five proving his word 1964 brother Brown said now after nineteen hundred years with the church ages passed he must be talking about us John intoxicate yeah you're welcome now after nineteen hundred years with a church ages passed and all the things that he prophesied look he's telling he's telling us this thing is wound up he prophesied of Luther Wesley and we just went through and seen it draw it out that was 1964 now sealed robe and the moon come down and drawed it out the Lord draw it on the board here for us remember the church agent I showed it and came down himself and confirmed that it be right after nineteen hundred years and we're at the end of the Laodicean Church age he promised in Luke 17 13 Oh pay attention he's going to lay right here mmm that this same son of man there's not - son of man the only one that this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it was inside him upon the earth did he do it does it have to come to pass it's impossible now he dot dot dot but I believe he was saying it's impossible for not to come fast now remember he comes in three names the son of man a prophet the Son of God the spirit the son of David the Millennium that all right he came as the Son of Man all right died on the cross resurrected ascended came back as the Son of God through seven Church ages and then he's to go to Israel as the son of David in the Millennium now there's one step missing but he'll bring it in right here now remember he coming three names son of man a prophet son of God the spirit son of David for the Millennium but in between this conjunction now according to his own words in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed reveal himself as what not son of God son of man will reveal his self in a different way Martin Luther never saw that way Wesley never saw that way Pentecost never saw that way and the people that said under the message never saw that way you and I will see that way we're seeing it now he will reveal himself in a different way not son of God the Son of man we all right just a little bit longer let's go to Matthew 17 so what way is that this is the week this is the different way cuz remember who's standing on the mountain Thunder man Thunderman standing on the mountain alive just got finished talking to Moses and Elijah and brother Graham today we're talking about what his second coming aren't we in the second coming hello hey man aren't we in the second coming so now Jesus has stepped out of that vision back into reality everybody with me say man I love this I didn't see this too the other day as they came down from the mountain and then when he lifted up their hands they saw no man save Jesus only hallelujah they didn't see three it's all one and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision the one he had just been in - no man until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead now he was standing there live they were getting ready to kill him though cuz they killed the son of man you can't kill the son of God son of God is spirit God you can't kill the son of God but they killed the son of man amen they killed that flesh they sure did brothers I'm telling you but he's prophesying and tell him don't tell this vision until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes they're going to Malik I'm right here they are quoting malachi because right now Israel knows that Elijah has to come back to us you're in the coming of the Lord to them they just don't know the one that Elijah gets here he's gonna say I'm not the third one or the fourth or the fourth one I'm weird the fifth Cody you've already missed about three or four of these comings right you understand the coming of Elijah the last coming of Elijah's the two witnesses going to Israel and he's going to tell them you you missed it and it's the sample that asked him saying well why didn't say the scribes or Malachi they still reading Malcolm what would you read mankind for then allies must first come because what does the Bible say behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord what and he will want turn the heart and other children back to the father's and the hearts of the father's back to the children that's not coming smite the earth with a curse they know he's got to come back jesus answered and said unto them he lies truly shall first come and restore restore all things now that's not John because John did not restore all things he's talking about our man in the end time because when those seals open that is when they restored all things to a group of people but now under there under their box they thought it was joined abandoned because he was at one coming of Elijah he was one coming of Elijah to them but John the Baptist Lord helped John the Baptist restored nothing he introduced to restore he was the one that took you from the Old Testament and give him to the New Testament Ariston you know what brother bran remember he said John never did one miracle now what is a miracle restoration you know if your you got cancer and you're dying and somebody prays for any chance relief you've been restored and then so he said Elijah first come and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come already and you knew him not but have done unto him whatever's they listed likewise shall also the Son of Man suffer of them then the disciples understood he spoke of them he spoke unto them he's not talking to me about that Elijah he's already spoke to me right here he's talking to the disciples understood of John's position while Jesus was here but he said it last shall truly come and restore all things and when he does that's coming back because remember we read it this morning in first Kings where it Elijah restored all the temple all the altar and all those things that put all the worship back together Elijah's message is a message of restoration but remember that when they're talking about John the Baptist he didn't restore anything he was an introducer he introduced the one to restore all things but brother Branham was a little bit different than John and you ain't disagree with me you might not because remember John the Baptist had a position a little different than brother Branham brother Branham was a church age messenger a born-again believer he had the Holy Ghost in his soul he was a new born again bride of Jesus Christ John was not and man John was not all John received the holy okay he'd ever seen you birth he did not there's no way because the least in the kingdom is greater than John the kingdom is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if the least and the kingdom is greater than john john didn't have the kingdom he introduced the kingdom he did his work he couldn't go and fulfill the next box of elijah william branham had to fulfill that box because the seals is what restores all things you didn't hear what i said a minute ago I guess the seals restore all things amen thereby alright say ma'am hmm alright let's read anointing ones at the end ton number six paragraph 260 in the very day that the Son of Man is revealed revelations 10 one two seven read it when you get home the seventh angels message opening up the seals so that's when the Son of Man is to be revealed that's what he just said in the very day that's the Son of Man is revealed revelations 10 1 through 7 Rita when you go home this everything just makes it open up the self what is it not the angel is the Son of Man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you remember he was discerning their thoughts and their thoughts were well you must be the son of man can you get it separated I don't think we have a problem with it but just in case somebody does that's where it seems to be so hard for you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the Son of Man because it's left to shucks he can't organize it it's the grain itself again hey alright let's read this last one and we'll be finished the next Sunday we'll talk about about this resurrection and look at some resurrections in the Bible because I think our problem is when we say resurrection there's kind of a I don't think we can go there cuz I ain't XYZ you know I mean what are you putting it on there what you said you got a check list do we have a check list I know there's certain things we got to go through we gotta go through stage performance please but well when I quit having bad thoughts when when I can get up at 7 o'clock instead of 10 when I can stop eating so much let's be honest we have a list that stops us from doing certain things I can't can't couldn't and wouldn't never done anything as the rising of the Sun that's why I listen that's why I told y'all brother branham brother branham when he was on that bridge he actually in when those seals broke he is right now he is reaching into the womb of your mind and changing your thoughts because all of our thoughts have been dead we're going to die we got to go to a funeral we got to do this we got have this we're all getting older am I telling the truth we've made a list of all these things that we can't do but brother I'm trying to get in that womb of your mind and turn turn that baby around to where he can be born right because remember brother Dell's always told us the very day that we took the change of the body is the day we can say we have been truly boarding him called this potential now you're not born again in this you know born again in the spirit realm you're boarding it in your soul okay all right look let's read this and then we'll then we'll I want to read the book of Acts and then we'll be done he was waived at the day of Pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessings to come now to be waved again when the Son of Man be risen again brother Brown was that telling you right here where he's getting it from cuz remember on the day of Pentecost he wasn't waved as the son of man he was waved as the son of God the Holy Ghost dwelling in the people man so the man's word made flesh in the end time and to be waved again we realize in the last day according to Luke 1730 in the son of son in the Sunday again in the day that the Esso n of man will be revealed or waved again over the people now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the Word of God by the Word of God by signs by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here that as we just quoted over to Luke 17 chapter in the 30th verse and Malachi 4 in the different scriptures that we are all acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people when the Son of Man be risen again tell tell this vision to no one in other words the coming of the Son of Man his second coming is the coming of the Son of Man see that's where even listen that's where even even the denominations and that are true and right that are trying their best they're missing it well I got God in my soul and I'm going to die and then one day there's a restoration don't a plan yeah right if you heard it I met and like brother Dale says they always say well maybe it's the next generation and that generation says well maybe it's the next generation why they're afraid to stand up they have no clue that the Son of Man is here they're missing it just like they missed him the first time but there's a group of people that's gonna catch it ain't gonna be the Word made flesh that the word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead something's going to die to have a resurrection that the dead tradition of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us and it's giving us life listen as Christ was the first one to from all the profits and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waved again in the last day oh my waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a week that proved it was a sheaf now many people think brother Branham was chiefly if he is he didn't come - he didn't prove it hello he'd prove it he's in the grave sorry you get hurt you feeling if you want to but that's exactly the truth because now he did come to a maturity that no one else come to a man but he was waving Jesus Christ so that the son of man can do the resurrecting William Branham never resurrected nobody but his message will in a group of people waving of the sheaf what was the sheaf the first one that come to mature see there's only one sheaf and that's Jesus Christ cuz remember he went down he resurrected he changed his body and he's standing in another dimension now there's nobody done that but there's gonna be somebody because he's gonna come back he has to come back and made us collectively the son of man not one person collectively in the bride hallelujah I'm sure that you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people you know what the wave was it was a sheaf wave they took her they took the first green ears and they put him in a bundle like your arm they bound them together and the priest walked out into the field in the presence of the people and he waved that wheat he said this hat in other words this is what he said he said this has come to maturity and in just a few short days this whole field it's going to look like this but this is the first one the priest would walk out and look at the field and they would be a certain group that would be Matt or first he would take and gather that cut it off and gather it and wave it and say ok this is proving that this field can come to maturity because this group has come to maturity Jesus Christ as the only one that's come to that maturity he's the grain but we are coming back but what did he wave over a field of dirt did he wave over a field of dirt no he waved over the same substance then he had in his hand the same substance he had in his hand he didn't wave corn and it was all week now he waved corn because it was corn coming to maturity hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection gotta have a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that half the maturity of the word what they say Oh fall that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there because I live you live also speaking to his wife because I live you live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead see brother Branham was standing there though knowing there was a group of people that had a even in his ministry had been quickened but he wasn't talking about the whole field the whole field hadn't even been planted yet most of us weren't even well I was but a lot of y'all wasn't even alive when this was pre physically and some of you were alive he was probably dead and doing something else hello 95 Bush right okay hey I don't may he don't mind he's walking around with a dead man walking dead man walking that's what we were dead man walking but you know what I saw if the old me dies God can quicken it I love what Dwight Moody said and I'll tell you again what moody said God will fill those who are not fool ourselves right now because I live you live also what a resurrection that that was and what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest now and as I say is to be waved again in the last day right now today one scripture noon we close right here ax 1 when they therefore will come together they ask of them saying Lord we don't have a clue what's going on we have missed everything you've said for three and a half years because they would have never asked that question if they would have known what he was doing I mean this guy had already raised from the dead walked around them for thirty to forty days alive and they asked this silly question if he had the Holy Ghost they didn't that question got answered ten days later when they asked the Lord was out at this time restore again he's getting ready to disappear he's getting ready to disappear he said Lord well thou at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel he said if it's not for you to know the time of the season which the father had put in his own power but ye shall receive power ten days later after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all of Judea Samaria into the other most parts of the earth now who was he talking to he was talking to them it's coming back as the son of God right on the day of Pentecost spirit God but watch what he said I mean watch what the Angels cuz it took a messenger to tell us what was going on and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their side and I'm sure some of them were just kind of what just happened we're supposed to receive power and we can't even see him now and while they look steadfast toward heaven behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into the heaven well in other words well what are you doing this same jesus now who ascended it son a daughter son of man son of man ascended that flesh man
