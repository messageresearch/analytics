gotta make on but this is just for church family so let's just keep it at that all right just keep us all in your prayers everything will work out just fine you know what I don't want I don't I don't want my friends to be around in this horrible time if the rapture comes and the tribulation begins I don't I wouldn't want any of my even center family to go through what people are gonna have to go through you look at all that stuff they're going through now wow that's just a man that's not even a blip on the screen of what's fixing to happen all right so in Mexico had another earthquake yesterday killed more people so it's a I was telling them this morning don't the only thing is holding back the big time the big the big boom is you and I but because these things are happening is because the church has come to a place I mean I was telling this morning I you talked about the 99 sheep you know brother Dale is talking about going back and going back going back we do that because what he did we look we loop back to pick up something we don't just loop back again so you can know we loop back remember the 99 sheep the 99 sheep stayed in one place but that one sheep went astray and and the Shepherd went back to get that sheep right but now remember what happened to that sheep if he kept doing that he got a broke leg remember the Shepherd would break his leg with love he would break that sheep leg to keep him from running off and that's exactly what's happening now he may have to break our leg I told somebody the other day you know when Jacob was changed to Israel every time he got out of that bed and he limped he was a limping Prince he remembered when God met him and changed his name so that maybe what we have to do is loop back in get one breaker leg and bring them on button you know what get them in the fold that's all that matters so let's go to Revelations 10 I would ask you I've never asked you before but I'll ask you to please listen to Wednesday night service or watch it because it's still a foundation this is going to be foundation part 2 and today we're going to try to do maybe some on the on the board to maybe explain what we're talking about so let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father we pray today Lord that you would sanctify us for this journey Lord you said you'd be with us even in us to the end of this thing and Lord we've come down to the end and you've never said that you'd leave us you said you'd be right here with us never leave us or forsake us so father just be with us take care of us and the further than the service be with the family there and so we're going through the situation and be with the the ones that are that need salvation in that family lord I pray that you touch them during this time that that they'll see you father and not see not see anything else but you Lord we pray that you'd be with the sickness among us it should heal them father you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from destruction we pray that should be with them or we pray that you give Lois strength as he's already ministered their brother burly's just be with him Lord take care of him give us something Wednesday night for the service be with the missionaries on the foreign fields Father give them fruit for their labor be with each one that's here under the sound of our voice keep us strong keep us happy and keep us in the way the truth and the life we ask these things in Jesus name Amen revelations 10 verse 1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we know who that is we know that's Christ a man so he and he's coming down and he had in his little hand hidden his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices I was about to and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not in the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that are therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that are therein that there should be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery singular mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now let's go to Ephesians 4 verse 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the hearers that's what we're trying to do today and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice how about that and be ye kind one to another it sounds like a statue of a perfect man to me and be you come one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now I made the announcement Wednesday but November the 4th at 7 o'clock I'll be speaking it brother I don't know if the camera and get in here or not that brother what's his name Aaron damn him Thank You Lord forbid did I forget that when I'm up there brother Tuen you but I'll be a brother Tim hems on November the 4th that's on a Saturday night so I'll be thank you baby I'll be speaking up there so you just pray for us that we'll say something that'll help the people we all awake or it's late okay thank you all right Joe can we get that or is that ok sometimes this gets in the way of the other camera so let's get started and if you'll remember last Wednesday those of you that weren't here that we were talking about Aseel now get into it also but you got to remember in a minute but you'll remember that a seal back in the old time there was not a book it was rolled up like this it's called a scroll okay and it would be sealed with a with a signatory thurr with they used to seal them with beeswax or they would seal them with some kind of paraffin wax and it would seal the document okay so we'll get into that in just a little while but I want to go through this and read the first quote here from brother Branham in the Laodicean Church age because you and I I was telling them or me and brother Lewis was talking yesterday we are we are a people that have come from something to something amen we come from somewhere to somewhere else all right because remember you and I have a commission that we have now a prophet that has come on the scene brought the message left the scene and has give that Commission - you and I - you and I to finish this thing mmm so in this in this quote here we want to take and divide like we did wins the afternoon lattice in church age now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations 10 7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the father's 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals now we read that's Wednesday night look it didn't say that the seven seals were the revelation of it was the thunders because remember it's two different things I'll read you the quote in a little while he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals alright it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so there but but now watch keep reading but consider this also this prophet messenger will be in his nature and manner as were Elijah and John the people of this prophet messengers day these people these people of this prophet messengers day will be as they were in Ahab's day and in John's and since it is only the children whose hearts will be turned by it it is only the children who will listen mmm hey man it'd be just children that'll listen now let's read this next one we read it wins tonight but we're gonna read it again and then we'll kind of break the chart down a little bit and see what's going on now listen faith 1953 this is 1953 listen god bless you I want to tell you just one thing I know I'm holding long but I just want this one little thing I know I want you to remember there's something fixing to happen now this is 1953 remember I told you that there's a step up coming in the church now see these things that you're now seeing are going to be just little things after a while some things are moving and I say this by the power of the revelation now look I said you better pay attention when the Prophet says that I say this by the power of the revelation of Jesus Christ whom I everyone in our doctrine and our baptism we've come to a place but there's some key that will unlock something here now he saw the book sealed on seven seals and when the Daniel saw the same and when the thunders under their voices he said don't write what was in the scripture but it would it had be revealed in the last day we're at the time we're at Kadish right now all right so he told us where we were that all right amen so now I want to kind of show you where we're at if that's all right I won't know what you can see better I don't know if you can see that blue or the black which one can you see better the black okay all right all right so now we got to go back to what we're looking at turn that way look can you still see excuse me all right now we know what that is that's the that's the drawing of the statute perfectly I'm not gonna put faith virtue knowledge temperance patience that all right okay so now but now you know one thing's for sure this is church age one two three four five six seven right that's a that's a that's the seven church age as you see them where he put those in there and then you got your gap you know here but now you got a gap here but now remember in the message in the Bible they told us that what the headstone was rejected the man's done all right so that's the way the pyramids the natural Pyramid of Egypt that's the way it look and then there was no cap put on the top of it but now remember who is the headstone Christ so when Christ was here this is the way this looked you could put his head here and his body here because we are the body that all right we're the body he was walking on the earth the total stature of a perfect man that all rights amen all right so he's this total picture but what happened right here in this time frame now listen to me in this time frame my brother Dale was talking he didn't know what I was gonna be doing today okay I see that now Rick remember he wants to son of man but the Son of God revelation was what the church ages was under amen now the Son of Man is this thing right here the whole thing that's the son of man Revelation but you got to have this before you can get to this that all right all right so you got this revelation through seven Church ages then you've got a gap right here that says Holy Spirit demands that all right and then this is the son of man or the headstone or the capstone the fullness of Jesus Christ is that all right are the revelation of the seals is that all right so you got because remember no one the seals were closed up it was sealed with seven seals sure there was a revelation inside here this put people in the body of Christ I was telling them this morning in a Sunday School class listen everyone has the spirit of adoption according to Romans 8 we have the spirit of adoption crying daddy daddy or I bye father that's what that means well now mature son I don't go to the daddy's house and start crying for him but as a baby I did amen so we received the spirit of adoption so we have received the spirit of adoption even in the church ages I said the spirit of adoption which what puts us in the family as sons remember the prodigal son he was a son the daddy there's no way the daddy could kick him out of the family now the son left and then he come back amen but he was still a son in the same way with you and I sons and daughters of God just like what brother Dale said this morning because I read that scripture in Ephesians 4 says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God and brother Claude now we're talking he's on adoption we were talking not before laughs the only thing that stops you from being a opted is you it's all late on you cuz in a natural sense I can help if I owned a big business or even a little business and I took Josh and I gave him because you know what I've got the intelligence for it I'm the owner I'm the one that's went through all the seven or eight or ten years of ups and downs in business and you know employees and this and you know all this bills and see I know that why because I'm the father but I teach it to Josh and I keep teaching it to Josh and he keeps going I I don't I don't want I don't want anything do that now whose choice is that I'm doing everything I can do God's doing everything he can do to make everybody a manifested son of God walking with headship but you and I can grieve that Holy Spirit like brother Dale said this morning but you will not ever reach this spot right here never will you reach that spot until the body change now the body changed but now what you got to do first you got to pass away you got to die so that's just the way it is I'm sorry all right that okay so we stop we grieve the Holy Spirit brother Brown said God I go out on a limb and said now he's not going to come out of you and go sit down on a stump that is a illustration that God will withhold from you remember watch what he did with brother Branham remember when he didn't go out on the field he listened to his first wife God scolded him he said you didn't listen to me you listen to your mother-in-law in other words and this is why you're going through what you're going through what he had to go through that so he could be an adopted son so he could be the person that God always wanted him to be that all right so now I've lost month I mean to make that build thing my thing so right here we have sons and daughters of God walking in the Word of God is that Alright say man this is also the faith of the fathers just like to pull that quote back up please you know go back and read that one yet this one no the first one sorry we'll get it right in a minute the first one all right know what this Mexican mountain can't afford to do two things one according to my account for he's to turn the hearts of the children to the father's he's to turn the hearts of the what the babbling Pentecostal baby children cuz this is where he comes in this age right he turns them back to the faith of the foundation fathers which the faith of the father's dough covers there's no way that Peter could teach us and to your faith virtue knowledge template patient godless brother Kenneth without him having that faith without him having that revelation our foundation Peter couldn't preach that you can't preach what you don't know you can presume but you're not exactly correct so the faith of the fathers we're to be turned back now that doesn't mean we got to go back down to the bottom of the pyramid but it does mean that we he takes those what children only the children whose hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen that's why then Pentecostals stayed stuck in that church age they didn't they weren't turned back into children from children to mature what with the faith of the fathers brother Ram said they were mature group of people of the group of Ephesus a big Church of 12 don't even enough to hardly have sunday-school class but they were the most powerful Church of the time why give me 12 born-again believers and you can do more with 12 born-again believers and you can 150 that don't believe and then but were turned back to the faith of the fathers he says exactly now watch but now - he's got the second part that this Malachi 4 person is supposed to bring he will reveal the mystery of the seven thunders and relations 10 now you come out of my life for a mint we're out of Melancon for now Malachi 4 come what to turn the hearts of the of the children to the father's now I'm gonna write this on here but you're gonna have to listen to what I'm saying this is 1947 to 1963 ish now you say well then we need to throw them tapes away no if you don't understand this you'll never get this so what brother Brown was doing was that was they what he was doing a restoration what he called it tying up loose ends and then tying up loose ends what from here to here I showed you in the evenin the Catholic Encyclopedia they then they no they changed the baptism they no they changed Father Son Holy I mean from Lord Jesus Christ to father son Holy Ghost they no they went from the one god theory not theory but revelation to their theory of three gods or three and one right well that was through these ages that that happened amen what happened was is here's eternity man goes like this this is the eternal Word of God so what is this and this that's a loose end brother branham came to what fill in the gap to where it would be what one continuous flow of Revelation why so God could talk to brother Branham not exactly so that God could talk to me and you amen so now you got the faith of the fathers you've got what the restoration back to what they believe down here that all right say man what they believe down here was you can say erode it or even done away with by most people in denominations by the time he gets to here that's why this is the worst church age we're supposed to have the most light the most revelation the most correct doctrine yet we are full of now when brother Branham was here was 969 two different denominations now there's thirteen thousand different denominations in the world it's God that confused no we are amen so it brings us back to and I said thank God for the revelation I was telling them Wednesday night for those of you who weren't here thank God you know for me for me myself a revelation that I don't have to stand at the white throne judgment to me it's an absolute what I get up in the morning I get up in the morning believing that I am a son of God and I don't have to stand in front of no judgment except the deeds of the body done whether good or bad not from my eternal salvation I don't have to be the one that stands in front of that white throne no we will actually be the white throne amen that to me that just thrills my soul then the prophet of God could pull that out of the word it's always been in there amen hit right on you Bible I'm not writing a new Bible this has never been in the Bible and then it just took a what a prophet to put it together it took a prophet to line it up like I told you winds tonight you know you can have a ten thousand dollar set of binoculars but if it's not focused it's worthless you can't see no more and you can't attend dollar from back from about here to to neither back there you can't see a thing I don't care if you paid $100,000 for binoculars if it's not in focus the property God brought the word back into focus and brought the full continuity of the Word of God that all right so we have the revelation of the son of God in through seven church ages the faith of the father's is all the faith virtue knowledge temperance patience dogs brotherly kindness working in a group of people is that right but remember this was rejected so this was not here during the church Changez yeah you say oh well he was yes he was he was down here working in the people but not like he wanted to I've got a quote here I couldn't pull it up back there because they don't have it fixed but brother Brown said in 1964 Feast of the trumpets the holy spirit has been bound for two thousand years under seven Sabbath's which is 49 this is your forty nine seven church age of seven times seven is forty-nine and he said could not get all the way out they were stuck amen stuck in the church ages yes why by doctrine but brother Brown said to be freed in the end time by the message of Malachi for which the real message of Milan time for that's the real message of Malachi for not this but you don't have this if you sleep through this like you're sleeping now you're not gonna get that you're not gonna get it this is your foundation faith of the father's foundation first remember that's why we're calling it a foundation for the seals we had to come out of the church ages to understand the seals cuz right here this is you Jubilee cuz who is that you believe Christ is the Jubilee he's the one they've been looking for all these years not someday or not some fiftieth day no the day of the Lord the 50th Jubilee has not happened on earth timewise that's in the Millennium but you and I by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have been birthed out of the church ages into Christ which is 250 waiting for the world to come to that is that all right say ma'am all right I'm gonna make you say man cuz I know you're not going to you say what are you talking about brother wait remember Wednesday night we're gonna read it in just a minute brother Branham preached seven church ages and they were vindicated by the angel of the Lord he drew the circles just like the moon's he drew him he said he said the Holy Spirit came upon the back side of the wall of a tabernacle and drew the same identical thing right seven Church ages but that still seven times seven couldn't get them all the way out cuz all the way member 49 Leviticus 25 eight only part go free but Leviticus 25:10 in the fiftieth everything goes free amen that's what you and I are looking at but this the revelation had it sealed up here remember now look I was telling them it down Sunday school class and I was telling Lewis yesterday the seals have been preached twice already Jesus preached him in Matthew 24 and brother Branham preached him in 1963 amen now let me show you something else you talk about adoption remember 2 to 3 in the mouth of two or three witnesses right the first adopted son was who Adam he had complete control God didn't have to come down every day and say Adam now you need that right Adam you don't need to name that Tiger know whatever Adam said God backed it up that's why the Bible calls you but under God then you've got the man himself obviously he was taken up on a mountain in Matthew 17 and was adopted in front of the decide the three witnesses right Peter James and John and then you've got brother Branham he said how do you know well I'm a reading here in just a minute but remember when he went up on the mountain before the seals opening this sword came in his hand what was the sword it was the word and he said it fit my hand perfect that's when God was saying if you're gonna hear anything I have give my word to this man and if you're gonna hear anything this is who you're gonna hear from a man that all right so look you say well there's three for a witness that's exactly correct but how about you and I you not have to come to the sword in hand you and I have to come to a place of adoption well you got quiet on that one we are you gonna stop yourself unbeliever but then this would be the revelation of the seals the revelation of the Son of Man so you got three parts what brother ramped now I want to show you there's a gap in here but brother branham preach to all the church ages got them all correct got them all lined up got the cow eating grass on the ground the tree everything's in place right but there was a part missing then there was a part missing right here now the ones that were and I hate to say this but the ones that were stuck in this these ages down here let's read now you don't think they were stuck listen to what he said it's gonna be a long reading so just bear with me but we're gonna read it anyway that all right number three now this is questions and answers y'all just heard it the other day when he said it and honed the questions and answers but watch what he says he says and then also knowing that right among you things are happening I just I know I know you that you don't see it I'm just positive that you don't see it you say brethren that's a hard thing for you to say say that I know it is but look let me just say this now I suppose this is just taped for ourselves and so forth but let me say this see that you don't get it and you're not so folks to get it folks that's why I it's gonna be a razor's edge but somebody's got to be on it amen somebody's gonna be have to be on the other side of this revelation if we stay right here death has taken everybody in this compartment you may say death has taken there's not one man come out of the tomb except one and he was before all this and he was the totality of it all Peter couldn't tell us about the chains of the body he never experienced him Paul could speak of it he'd never experienced it but Jesus could tell us about it what through the prophets amen but you're not supposed to get it so don't try to interpret anything that's the problem they started interpreting for 54 years they've been interpreting the seven seals what the seals are what the thunders are what this is what that is they've made it seven men they made it polygamy they made it everything they wanted to make it except back to the simplicity watch this just take my advice if you believe me now if God has given me favor in your sight and you know them revelations and things I've been here within a long time I'll always and it's always been right now to double prove it right it hooks right back in with the word see so you know it's dust set the Lord that's exactly see it's prove to you now take my advice as your brother don't put your own interpretation anything you're just going to live a good Christian life why this is a good Christian life the faith of the fathers and there's an absolute great Christian life I wish we had everybody living that life me included you're just going to live a good Christian life because you'll only wind yourself away what from I didn't I didn't make that read but I should have from the real thing when you do it see you'll only wind your way again away from the thing and all of your conscious and know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is now I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now now watch because remember when we move over into this foundation a little bit more we're gonna talk about the third pole this is before we even get into the seals because brother Ram says the third pole is laying dormant now you know he said that the third pole laying dormant now okay well he said but he said it's gone from you right now because he's fixing to tell them it's the third pole but it's gone from you right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it and it's but so help me with this Bible in my hand I know what it is it's been told you before so just don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour we're living in a time where though well well we just be real humble be a Christian try to live for God live honest with your fellow man listen we got to get to that part before we get up to the top live honest with your fellow man and love those who don't love you that's brotherly kindness it's easy to love somebody loves you don't try to make any you see you do you only make it a mysterious something and that's the real program of God up you see what are you saying you only make it a mysterious something because the real program of God is not a mysterious something but yet it is yesterday afternoon something happened in my room that I'll never be able to leave it you see so you about two weeks ago something happened they'll never be able to law as long as I live I'll never be able to get away from it saying so but if the church you're not supposed to know these things so don't put no interpretation to anything see you just go ahead and just remember what I told you live a Christian life go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for Christ tell the people how you love them just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people see because if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and then you're off the beaten track now listen we've obviously been off the beaten track if this is the greatest message the seals is the greatest message that's ever been preached since the beginning of time and we just let it lay on the pages so every time you try to do it you've done that see so just don't don't try to make no interpretation and especially tonight when that seal becomes up in front of you now what's he talking about the Seventh Seal because that night he preaches the Seventh Seal see just don't try to interpret it you just go ahead and just be humbled go right on with the same plain message now you say brother Branham is that we being the Church of the Living God shouldn't we see what people trying to they're trying to elevate everything well as I was trying look here I want to say save yk9 I ought to have no no I don't you remember I'm saying this for your good see I'm saying it so that you'll understand if you believe me now listen to what I tell you see see now here's a post now at the Branham Tabernacle some of yous been there you know there's post right there close to the to the altar there's post on each side cross hanging on one I think on one side so anyway because remember that's the brand-new building that's when he put those post in I know brother Gary don't like post you know like he's posting his church either but that's okay well call it a listening post but watch what he's saying and in it got radio see there's warnings and things can be done like a sword in your hands watch him slide that in there there's warnings and things can be done like a sword he's got my radio so it can pick from the evil are pick from only as it gets its message see now but now for instance to the ordinary man there's been so many cults and clans rise up over this little out pour into the spirit until people gets all worked up and a bunch of stuff go out starting a little move and you know things and things see you don't want to do that now see now remember just stay the way you are and you say well the Lord show no look what he done well the lordship no no not just be careful hey now look here let me show you something did you know there's 10,000 voices in this room right now literal voices of people that's coming through the electronic waves of radio why don't you hear them why don't you hear them their voices is that right they're waving right through here now there's people forms bodies moving right through this room now is that right well why don't you see them why don't you see them they're here actual voices like my voice well why don't you hear them see it's gonna strike something first to reveal it it's got to strike something first to reveal it now he wasn't telling he wasn't telling them people they didn't have anything he just said they didn't have what was needed at the moment to strike what he was talking about that alright say man now do you understand so just don't interpret nothing if God wants you to know anything he will send it to you so just be real real solid now hold still something has happened and I'm telling you now something has happened now just be real you understand what I mean don't you and just be don't try to make yourself odd to be a Christian because you take yourself away from God and you you you if you can understand this is that third Paul you should have got that the other day now obviously they didn't by discernment he knew they weren't getting it especially when he told them to ask questions on the seals and they started asking about pen Howe by me it wasn't a time it wasn't a time you remember they'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two listen this can be impersonated brother Robinson you can have a part of those virtues and not even be a Christian but you can't have love of God and not be a Christian and then so now just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room he said right here in this room and there's something here there's Ashlee in this room angels watch this voice of God but how do you you can't if you can't hear the natural voice without something to send it out how you going to hear the spiritual voice it wasn't that they were not getting a revelation they got a revelation but it wasn't the revelation that this is talking about now you might make believe that somebody is singing this certain song that might not even be there see but when it actually strikes now most of you don't even know that a radio all of us older ones do I can remember when a radio was an option in a car I know y'all can - air conditioning was an option okay daddy would cut the air conditioner off going up a hill to save gas right anyway but a radio instead of being digital it had crystals in it it actually had diamonds in it don't know that radio had a crystal in it that was cut a certain way that's why that when a m55 they had a certain crystal in a m55 radio station and you had an am 55 crystal in your station now if you were off on another station you'd get in less than am 55 hey man WD you in I'm giving them a plug here W in am 55 in Gainesville if you had it if you had it or 750w SBF off its your right yeah that's right 750 was WSB right but you could pick up 750 if you were on 550 the crystal wasn't cut the right way you didn't have the right crystal to receive what was being sin I hope you get this but when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike that's us that's you and I today when it actually strikes the crystal that is supposed to strike then it gives a true true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture see what I mean it shows us the clear picture it shows clarity it gives us what faith from the faith of the fathers we're coming through seven Church ages absolutely we're coming through what we're coming through all these virtues all the church ages are gone sure we're living in Laodicea we know that but I thought we got to be called out of the church a bride never was in an age in their soul but we still have the time element of that church age is that all right we live in the Laodicean Church age but we are not of that layout of century if we're still of that Laodicean Church age we're not even in this picture that I'm drawing you're not even down here because when you're born again as a baby you're born again right down here right down here the action you birth but Paul even Peter knew they said being born again by the incorruptible Word of God which liveth and abideth forever is that all right say man all right so we're looking at a birth and then what I was telling you Sunday and then we'll get into this for just a second so what happened when brother Branham he goes and I'll read it here in just a minute but I'm gonna run through it real quick we see that he preached the seven Church ages lined them up corrected the way they're supposed to be put all the prophets or church age messengers remember when he got to Irina's he was looking at Polycarp because public art was closed but remember Polycarp leaned just a little bit to organized religion the Holy Spirit said no that's not the man Irina since the man so he line them all up he lined up all the what faith of the fathers and then he comes to 1963 he comes to 1963 and even in spoken words reading the seed he said he said Lord in other words he thought he thought this was all of it Lord had got him out on a limb what do I do and he says of yet Malachi for now remember you got to take that and see that the first part of Malachi 4 was fulfilled turn the hearts of the white children to the father's that was done spoke original seed he said but as of yet Malachi 4 has not been what in other words made manifest in other words the totality of the of the message of brother Branham takes us from the bottom of the pyramid all the way up through even to the headstone no one no one came to this place they're right here stuck they without us cannot be made perfect but there's a gap right here and it says holy spirit that all right and like I told you son Wednesday night what is that gap that gap is a breach amen brother Branham goes to the breach and I think I've got it here for don't I read it next Sunday and he says we've come to here and now there's a breach now what's the name of that sermon the breach between the seven church ages and the seven sealed there's a gap or a breach now remember what I told you now breach I was telling you it's just how the Lord deals with me I saw a big pregnant lady I'm shorting big she was this big and I don't know whether she was talking about a breech birth or I just it just came to my mind and then I my mind went back to the breach and to confirm that the Lord showed me something again yesterday because remember in a breech birth your turned with the feet down that's not the way he's supposed to be born and the Lord told me yesterday I was just thinking about though well you know what maybe people didn't understand what I was talking about but what is a breech birth it's feet first then you got the head last the Lord said no he had to turn us back because we're in the headstone the head has got to come first a real birth the head comes first so in the breech the prophet of God was breaching the church ages where we want sure they were born again sure they had the baptism the Holy Ghost but they had they were in a breach where they couldn't get to the revelation of the Son of Man that's why the Holy Spirit is here it's not another Holy Spirit it's the Holy Ghost that's telling us about our birth about redemption ain't came spilling but that's what God's give us people he's bridged that gap telling us about Revelations father you got to get revelations 5 before the seals can open amen and then all right so there's your breech we were about to have a breech birth we couldn't get birthed out of the ages he told us we couldn't in the Feast of the trumpets he said he couldn't get all the way out hey there was a conception there was a baby getting ready to be born it was just getting ready to be born the wrong way so what brother branham literally that's why that quote literally turned us turned us back to what not just the faith of this father but the face of that one hey man that's what the son of man revelation is is the opening of those seven seals that all right say man now let's read for just a second right here I get all worked up because it to me it like is I'm happy I'm just happy I'm just happy that the Lord fitted all the other is this the sign of the insert number four the seventh angel revelations 10 seven is the seventh church age messenger now watch in the days now watch here now this is the scripture right here okay this is Scripture but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God should be finished now sounding forth this mentioned you're the seventh angel here it's the sound forth his message to the Laodicean church notice his type of message now it wasn't to the first angel wasn't given that second third fourth fifth six but in the seventh angel that had this type of message what is it Paul brought a message looks like a mess done it Paul brought a message but what happened to Paul it wasn't Paul but his church age the people in his church age what started going down that's what brother Graham said you know talking about the church ages the church ages you had the gap in here well there was the one that was a porter that come in here Paul come at the end of the age into the Pentecostal age to bring his message to Ephesus well when that light started going out God brought another messenger Irene yes but this age here there is no you either going to go down or up amen there's no other messenger now sounding forth this message the seventh angel here is sounding forth his message to lay out the sin Church now this type notice his type of message now it wasn't to the first angel wasn't given that second third fourth fifth sixth but it is the seventh angel they had this type of message what was it notice his type of message finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book the seventh angel is winding up all the mysteries that's laying loose ended all out there through these organizations and denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery that's what the Bible said finish the mystery of the written book now let's note a few of these mysteries if you want to write them down first these talks about dr. Scofield he goes back to Matthew 13 and he answered and said unto them because it's given to you disciples because it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but not to them but to them not to them it's not to them these and them that is not given now watch brother Branham the mystery here is the mystery a mystery of Scripture is a previous we hidden truth now divinely revealed but but which is a supernatural element still remaining to spot the revelation amen the revelation of the church ages they had a revelation but there was a supernatural element that was what sealed up to the time of the end he told Daniel he said sealing up to the time of the end people go to and fro knowledge will increase but there'll be one group of people that will catch this and manage that alright alright number five now we turn quickly because I know there's a baptism service what is this seventh seal book or what a great thing did you notice how it says here it was seven seals on the back of the book it's something oh may God help us now and give us courage and maybe sooner or later I can get to you look this is not written in the word it's sealed on the back of the word the book was sealed by these seven seals the whole mystery of the book is sealed up in these seven seals this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole book of the revelation now remember what is that Revelation chapter five because they said right here and I saw the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and written within insides written that's what we're reading this morning and on the backside sealed with seven seals now listen people there's not 14 seals I didn't told you that Wednesday night there's not 14 seals there's only seven seals all right breaks all your type of fish 14 there's seven seals all right but there's mysteries under those seven seals it's not just what that is cuz I'll show you in a minute like we're doing Wednesday night outside the Bible what the Bible doesn't even say it's sealed in here with seven seals the mysteries of God now what is it now notice a seal represents a finished product something that's been already tested proven and then sealed whereas we have the earnest of our salvation now by being sealed with the Holy Spirit now this is the earnest that is the earnest of our salvation because listen true salvation true redemption the end of all Redemption is we're standing on the earth in a glorified body you can say I've been born again when you're standing in a glorified body hey man cuz right now I'm only boarding into my soul you're only born again in your soul those that are in the sixth dimension they're going to get in their soul but their bodies laying rotting in the ground a man that's not complete that's not complete redemption that all right now let's read right here number six and then we'll give an example we might stop right here and then we'll carry on next Sunday that's okay Gables instructions that Daniel 1961 we find out I remember the seals hadn't broke at this time we find out that this was sealed with seven seals sealed with seven seals and each seal was wrapped around look whatever each seal was wrapped around and as the revelation come forth he pulled the seal and undone this and read what the seal said then he undid the next one read once the seal set undone the next one pulling out see what that seal said what the revelation was that's exactly what our seven seals that we're going into shortly we trust that we'll do eat seal when it took off the book will be unrolled and that shows exactly what taken place that all right say ma'am now let's go to the next quote because I want you want to read this and then we'll go back to this skip that one cuz we read it Wednesday night cuz remember let's not go back to Esther let's wait let's no let's no bypass the Word of God right here also for the Jews and book of Esther as is liking you in the King's name and seal it with the king's ring now for the writing which was written in the King's name and sealed with the King dream may no man reverse you remember what happened the king wrote a decree that the Jews were to be killed right then Esther goes back and pleads with him and he says okay I'm gonna an opportunity to defend themselves because you can't reverse once the king says something same thing with the Word of God you can't reverse what God said God can't reverse what God said so it was sealed but now remember what was the most important part of that the seal or what was written inside the seal was just what making sure no one saw it but the people that was supposed to see it you and I it was sealed but what was written on the inside was the important part these are quotes I scribbled on a piece of paper wins you now but I got some quotes now that's the same thing with the boxcar folks I'm telling you the boxcar the seal is important it keeps you from somebody from breaking in it keeps somebody from taking what you got but that seal was not the most valuable thing it was what was inside that boxes what was valuable it's what's inside the boxes what was valuable it's what was inside when the seal broke sure that's valuable but that's the wild horse riders Antichrist it's not this that's the wild horse riders Antichrist you said I'll prove it to me oh I believe I will number seven the breach between the church ages in the seals now notice the seven seals holds the mystery of the book until we can see see see what those seven seals has sealed in we're only presuming these things now let's go and go down to 49 notice seven seals on the book has the those seven seals has the book sealed see the book is absolutely sealed the book is absolutely sealed amen do you see it the book is absolutely a sealed book until the seven seals is broke it's sealed up with seven seals now that's different from the seventh under seal a that's different there's two things we're working on here this is the seven seals on the book but it's not the book it's not the book the problem is is people going well the wild horse riders han across and they went with that seal because remember here stands the land with the book is hand and there goes a wild horse rider there goes there goes that part of the seal and everybody's going and they're forgetting this that's been our 54 year problem knowing the wild horse rider was the Antichrist will not change your body sure it'll help you it'll line it up but right here is the Thunder there's the voice of God that's different from the seven thunders see this is the seven seals on the book now remember Wednesday night what is that book in the breach about 49 times brother Branham said book of redemption not book of the devil I'm not worried about him once the seal breaks I'm not brother Bram said that's why I'm not the son of Charles in a libretto he knew that seal was broke and he had to Thunder which was a revelations what contained in in the seven seals the other I don't mean to holler at you I just told you I'm just happy cuz we got all the you know really I mean we got people in the message that are stuck right here listen Clarence working under this right here I know you're gonna hate me now Clarence Larkin musta got something from God that that sale was Antichrist but the problem with Clarence Larkin was he didn't have a met she's behind it listen God reveals things to people come brother Bram didn't bring out lo Goss and all that Scofield had that in his Bible already before brother Branham got here but why did it take it took a prophet with a message behind it to take those seals break them off and then what have a message I mean you know we thought well Clarence Larkin was just the denominational person well you know what so was so was the Pentecostal Oral Roberts he didn't accept the message brother Branham called him a prophet Billy Graham he said brother Graham had to hold go they didn't have the message he now the message behind it hey aff Bosworth the old oak tree never truly accepted the message but don't tell me he ain't gonna be there he's gonna be there but it's gonna what take a revelation from the people that are alive to get him out of the ground hey man the seals will not be released until the message of the seventh angel so we are presuming but the genuine revelation of God will be made perfect in that sounding and vindicated truth now that's exactly what the word says the mystery should be finished at that time and the seven sealed book remember it was closed here in Revelations five and in Revelations 10 it was open now we're gonna see what the book says about how it become open and it's not made known until the lamb takes the book and breaks the seals and opens the book see the Lambs got to take the book is his right it's his book let's read one more number eight then we'll stop right here and we'll start again next week sign all right say man so y'all ready to quit them tricked you didn't breeze between two seven churches and seven seals watch and revealed as the seals well he woke some of you up and revealed as the seals break and are released to what us watch then we can see what this great plan of redemption is and when and how it's going to be done it's all hidden in this book of mystery he'll hear it sealed up with seven seals so the lamb is the only one who can break them and the whole thing here the seven seals got the mysteries of God from the foundation of the world all sealed up in there and revealed by seven different seals that if God willing let him let us pull back those seals hold on a minute now look what he said pull back the seals and look down through the book to find out what it's all about oh I hope we have a great time there the mystery of redemption is sealed until this book could not be broken until the last angels message the scrolls there we note it was there we note it was redemption we believed it was redemption so that seven sealed book is the book of redemption but it was sealed with seven seals seal number one you say what's the revelation of the first seal he said well that the Antichrist was was the the writer of the of the portion now I'll bring you quote next Sunday I didn't want to bring you this Sunday we're brother Branham says my revelation of this seal is that Christ the lamb and the Holy Ghost is the self same person so don't tell me that's just a seal and that's it don't tell me the revelation no when that broke you know who had it sealed up that guy that guy written the stent was on the horse that's the one that had it sealed up God never wanted to seal anything up he wants to reveal Satan's sealed it he's the one who just put the seal satai you can't understand that I'm the Holy Ghost I'm riding through the churches I'm the Holy Ghost when all over all the time what he was you doing was he was sealing everything up because remember God wants to break them God don't want don't think he wants to seal is me and you grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption let's stand to our feet brother branham brought us a wonderful message and then he's off the scene now and it's gonna taste the Bible says what the the ignorance of preaching cuz I want to ask you a question and I ain't gonna be big-headed about it and I'm like brother Dale I don't really care what anybody thinks about me I really don't just want God thinks about me who have you heard preached that the seals was everything I've heard he preached a thousand times that the seal the boy that white horse riders Antichrist and that's this revelation of the seal no that ain't the whole thing there's a mystery lying underneath there that you and I have not been able to see until now so the seven seals are not the seven thunders but without the seven seals break you're not gonna see the seven thunders and the seven thunders is not some other something because they got it right here let me read this so they don't have this quote this day the scriptures reveal watch this I want you to listen to something you remember when brother Branham jr. Jackson had the dream of the pyramid everybody familiar with that say Amen right Amen all right so what was that pyramid alright watch what happened called the Holy Spirit revealed it brother branham in this stage of Scripture fulfilled to nineteen 1965 and I stood there a little bit and I'm gonna read this next Sunday so you don't have to pull it up in the back and I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it and I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man through justification state fication baptism of Holy Ghost baptism in Jesus name the faith of the fathers and all these things has been revealed but there is secrets that's hid inside because the Bible is sealed with seven seals I must go there to find him remember what jr. Jackson said he saw brother Brad what whipped the top off of the pyramid look down in the pyramid and said lot had never shined on what was down there there's your thunders there's your thunder lot had never shined on that but you know what it wasn't written in some mysterious writing it always was there it just took somebody to rip the top off and be able to have enough revelation listen and I don't mean nothing about junior Jackson this is not a dish at him he was standing down here and brother Branham was right here yeah he was the only one that could reach the top and rip it off member junior Jackson was looking up I'm not saying the interaction didn't have the faith of the fathers I'm just telling you he wasn't in the position that brother Branham was when brother Branham his position was he was up there at the top where he could rip the top off of that pyramid listen a novice cannot understand I'm telling you I told him this morning there's footmen and horsemen the Bible says how you gonna how you gonna keep up if you get on if somebody is the horsemen are taking off the footman has led the battle for a long time but the horsemen the Calvary is fixing to come and when they do they're gonna pass right by the footman and what are we gonna do if we're not the horsemen we're gonna get left behind but we don't have to we need [Music] [Music] [Music] my hands in worship there is no there is no and I bless your Holy Name you are great you know me here it goes so great there is no one else like you there is no one else signing you're dreaming you do miracles so great there is no one else like you there is no like you you know you think them all the times in the world you'd want to be a lot of the cool today is the day that I want to be alive yeah I want to be here I want to see this thing that every prophet from Moses to today wanted to see when God could work without limitations and I believe we're right here on the verge of seeing that thing break but we've got to be in a position to receive it like it brother Nell said you can have a ticket to the airport a ticket on downtown you can already pay for it but if you go down to the Greyhound station and wait to get on the truck on the plane you got what you need you got the cow you got the grass you got the tree but you're in the wrong place we've got to know where we are know what our position is know that God has give this to a special group of people we are a special group of people we are a headstone people we're supposed to be all the way up to the capstone of love and let it flow through us let's thing flow through me done all right let's thing flow through me one time and then we'll go Feeny buddy has a need you just pray you just pray that God will give you a revelation like I said I don't want to leave nobody behind but I promise you Oh a good trained soldier he'll just pick up that gun if his partner gets killed he's going forward because what do you want to do he wants to kill that god that's hurt his partner hey man that's what we need to do we see people falling by the wayside we shouldn't just kick them out of the way we should say hey for his sake I go forward

hand to worship and to magnify my name flow through me Holy Spirit pray to God that you've got the right crystal that you've tuned in that you're tuned into the eternal there's an eternal channel and we got to turn it because there's a crystal in there that we got to hit once we hit that crystal guess what we're going to receive what we're supposed to receive in this time regardless of what we think about anybody else regardless of what your feelings are my not to me that's out of the way amen we go forward God give me what is mine it's mine the ones that have gone on they're waiting on me and you to get that thing dialed in just right you know who you know who's waiting on us I was telling them this morning there's two prophets waiting on us there's two prophets that cannot do one thing they can't even get the Holy Ghost till we leave you show all huh hey if we go in the rapture everybody where the Holy Ghost goes in the rapture so they can't get the Holy Ghost till we leave cuz remember brother Hanson we go up the Holy Ghost comes down to the two witnesses in to the Jews so they can't even receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost till we get out of here everything's waiting on us we want to look at Israel look at the Stars and look at this look at yourself we're the ones that's keeping everything from happening you know why they're having earthquakes in Mexico me the
