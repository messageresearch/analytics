I want to see you I want to see you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see to see your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy olio me shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you praise the Lord Jesus gonna be in the house of God good to be here and hope that everyone on line that's streaming in and listening I hope they're all doing good with the blessings of the Lord and though we've been shut in most of the time but hope you've been blessed taking this time this opportunity to seek the Lord and draw closer to him amen because we have no excuse in this hour I have no excuse praise the Lord so appreciate brother brother Wade and preciate brother Dale for just just the all the different things and everybody coordinating things as we've been changing things around in the last few weeks just thank God for for brother Dale you know just still keeping the doors open and matter and but at the same time of course you know trying to stay on abide by the law so that we don't they don't have to say anything about it about us right amen so we thank God for this opportunity so while you're standing let's just go ahead and go to let's read from first John chapter 4 first John chapter 4 and I don't know the brothers will can bring that scripture up I don't have it in the slideshow so that's why I don't know they got my text or not but all right thank you first John chapter 4 and let's start at verse 16 and it says and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him here herein is our love made perfect what's this verse urine as our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so not that we will be or that we were but so are we in this world all right because he the way he is if you have eternal life in your soul that's the way you are just just just like him amen there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love that's pretty strong words but that's what the Bible says we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also praise the lawlessness by our heads this afternoon and this evening and we just want to just speak about this afternoon just little thought maybe a little Sunday School lesson about perfect love casteth out fear perfect love casteth out fear so let's just bow our heads our gracious Lord Jesus as we come before you father we thank you Lord for the opportunity to open back the pages of your word Lord father God you've heard their many requests that were mentioned here Lord we ask that you'd be with those individuals Lord we pray tonight that you would be with brother dick sister Gayle Lord God ask that you would just have your will have your way Lord brother dick Lord and your mother neighbour father to even strengthen him even at this hour Lord and we pray Lord that you can you you so father and we ask that you give strength to sister gal ask you Father God that you would just be with all the other ones Lord and ask that you bless them be with them provide for them as you promised that you would Lord be with us here tonight Lord as we open back the pages of your word and endeavor to speak on this little thought that it may encourage one another Lord and give us father's strength Lord for the days to come bless anoint my lips Lord God and just help me Lord Jesus this evening I pray I commit myself into your hands now commit the rest of the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you you may be seated praise God you know I was reading a little story a little story about uh there was a couple who was getting married and there was a the the bride had had a friend and it was a group and the girl she wanted to she couldn't attend the wedding so she she wanted to send the bride and the groom I mean the groom and the bride a text message and this is the verse the day that she sent them you know she wanted to send him the you know first John chapter 4 verse 18 you know where it says there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear but you know out of had of her you know rushing and writing the text so quickly you know she forgot the the the first the number 1 John chapter 4 so it said John chapter 4 verse 18 so of course when the girl when the girl received it it said for you have had five husbands the one you live with now is not your husband so you know that's that's one of them typos you know but I thought that that was funny and kind of make ya'll laugh and kind of start it a little bit right you know praise the Lord so but we want to talk take this topic and just you know sometimes we I've always thought you know I wonder what what it is what what is the connection between love fear faith and all those things and there is a huge connection there and and so you know because the Bible says Paul Paul tells us that he had the Lord has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of a sound mind you know I'm also reminded of what of what Paul said that the the gifts or the fruits of the spirit are love joy peace longsuffering and all those good things you can read there in Galatians I believe it is there but none of those and none of those do you see the word fear it's always a love love and that love Saints is the love of God which is the agape love of God amen so for us for us Christians amen you have this this evening I mean if you're born again by the Spirit of God amen perfect love in you amen that's this is just what the Bible says amen the perfect love resides in you even though it's hard for us to manifest it on the outside that's the reason why we need the statue of a perfect man amen praise God but if if God's eternal life dwells in your soul amen then all of God dwells in you amen praise God so we're just waiting for this body to catch up to that praise the Lord Amen so we're gonna just look at some slides here and hopefully the the ones at home can benefit and be able to view them tonight so amen so we see here in first John chapter 4 verse 16 and says and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him Amen why because God is love so love dwells in you Amen if God is in you right it just makes sense praise the Lord first John 4:7 says beloved let us love one another for love is of God and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God next slide amen what is agape love the word love in verse 16 is agape love which is is the Greek word in which the love that God loves us with it means charity I think I meant to put something else there and I'm that I missed it but charitably feasts of charity brotherly love amen affection goodwill love benevolence love feasts and first John 4:16 says and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us amen praise God so that's the love that God loves us amen that loves us He loves us with he doesn't love us you know he's not like you and I mean we do something to one another and something a man might get in between that love that that's an affiliate love you see they may get in between there but Amen when you truly love by man with the perfect love of God amen no matter what happens amen the love of God outtakes outshines amen and we're gonna see later on a man that the love of God the perfect love of God is shown most of the time and most in most instances in the word it was displayed in the times of trials and tribulations Amen so let's go to the next slide so what is filial love and and it's feel love is which the physical human love we have for one another or even animals see if you have a pet that's and you love that pet that's that's filial love it's it means to love to approve up to kiss to show signs of love to treat affectionately or kindly to be fond of doing and verse that mentions that kind of love in the Bible he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me jesus said and when you look up that word loveth that's the word phileo the Greek word phileo so nothing wrong with this love as a matter of fact when we're born in the world that's the first love that we have for your mom and your dad you know for the first fake in the first face that you see is your mom's most of the times sometimes it's nurse butt or the doctor but that's that's the first type of love that we come to this world and we have amen the only way you can get that filial love is through is through born-again experience that's the only way that you can obtain that filial love amen next slide where the Brenham says here now love one another above everything that you do love one another and as you love one another you'll love God's see you love each other and you'll love God for god is love and a man that walks in love walks in life praise the Lord I like that amen because again the this love of God this perfect love of God relates to eternal life right amen in next slide and perfect love casteth out all fear brother branham continue then if you can take him at his word and not fear a bit about it say lord I love you I know you're going to answer because you promised me you would and I just know you're going to do it see and it takes away all fear Amen praise God next slide how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's in filial now how about a gap oh to to God how can it be if you don't love God if you said you love your wife and never tell her about it and never sit down and make love to her expressing it to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country I hope you brothers do that amen we got some of them to raise their hands all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it that's the way we do to God when we love him we tell him about it we sat down and we adore him and worship Him and love drives us to that amen all the things that you know and how pretty is this we're ready that next slide okay so so the the love of God you see we express our love to God amen both in the filial and when you have eternal life a man in the agape as well you see that sometimes I don't know if you ever had those instances where you just you're you you're just praying and you just you you you feel that love for him and you just want to worship Him and I've had times like that when you know where you just cry and it's just like Lord I I just wish I could just you could be right here and I could just hug you and you just have me around around you and you around me you see and and that's that and there's nothing wrong with that but Satan will come in and try to will try to pervert that in in people's life and we'll look at something here in just a moment so God doesn't want us to just abide in filial love because that love can easily fail you see that you know you see it in little kids you know little kids when they fight when I don't love you anymore and they'll do you know but sometimes they don't know what they're talking about you know but but you see that love fails you see brother Dale maybe I did I do something to brother Dale or Dale does something to me or something like that and and if we don't have the Holy Ghost amen and if we just loved one another in the phileo amen that something something that something happens in between there that could just break the relationship right there but see this shouldn't be so with brothers and sisters in Christ amen praise God God's agape love can never fail because it's eternal pure life-giving love amen it's it's eternal life right praise God next slide now here's a perverted type of love right here this is another type of love it's a perversion it's called narcissism how many have heard of that amen it comes from the Greek mythology who ableism it was a person by the name of narcissus a young man he fell in love with his reflection in the water and and and he was looking at it so long and just fell in love with it and there was people I believe it was a woman called echo was trying to call out the call to her and he didn't care anything about her he just wanted he just looked at his reflection fell in love with it so much that he fell in the pool and drowned that was that's that's the story see so he goes it teaches a lesson sometimes people are so stuck on themselves stuck on stuck on themselves and don't care anything about what's going on around them other people around them amen in and this is what narcissism means is this excessive interest or in in or admiration of oneself or one's physical appearance nothing wrong with wanting to look nice but if that's how you care about you have narcissism selfishness involving a sense of entitlement that's narcissistic as well a lack of empathy and a need for admiration in other words you always need somebody to pat you on the back or say something good to you in order for you to move on in life that's a narcissistic attitude as well and you know what says technology and society has made people that way today the other they just made us made them exactly that way let me give you an example everybody around you but this is all that we do nobody's talking with each other nobody's fellowshipping with each other that is a narcissistic attitude that's the reason why these are called iPads and iPhones and all those things because it has to do with III me me me [Laughter] so we're if we're not careful Saints the society can make us narcissistic and we don't even know it second Timothy three versus one or two this says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for man shall be lovers of their own selves and the verse continues but that but that's the that's the point I want to make with that so that's a perverted type of love and that's not the type of love we want it we want to we want to have now there are two types of fear in the Bible because Saints you know the Bible tells us in one place to fear God love him love his commandments fear him and then another place is as fear you know we shouldn't fear you see for example Ecclesiastes 12:13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God but that type of fear there is a respect of reverence and keep his Commandments for this is a whole duty of man amen if you go back to the previous sermon that I preached about respect amen you can you can can look more into that and about fearing God amen respecting God amen second Timothy 1:7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear now that fear right there that Paul was talking about was cowardice or being timid now we're not willing to take that step for God that's the spirit of fear that got that that God does not want us to have but of power and of love and of a sound mind Saints that's that's the kind of that's the kind of power that God has given us in this hour so it doesn't matter what goes on in the world doesn't matter what's happening doesn't matter what's taking place a man when God is in you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that you has not given you the spirit of fear amen but of power and a sound mind amen and we're more than what remember that he said he said what was it that he said do not fear because however I have overcome the world amen so if he's overcome the world amen and we're overcomers with him why do we have to fear you see there's no there's no space for fear in a believers life amen praise God next so where does love where does perfect love originate from now first John 4:18 that we just read it says there is no fear in love see there is no fear in love in other words it there is no space for fearing when you have the true love of God but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment ya in other words it bothers you it torments you it condemns you it causes it even leads to hatred and all these things he that feareth is not made perfect in love Amen Adam and Eve were created in the image of God we believe that amen and Adam and Eve had eternal life in their soul praise God amen therefore Adam and Eve had perfect love amen they had dominion over nature full faith not afraid of anything that's why Adam could could step in with calm and peace and be able to name the animals and not be afraid be around the tiger be around the lion and say look you are lion or you are tiger and not be afraid at all because he had perfect love dominated his his being you see and there is only one source of eternal life and what and one source of perfect love and that is God and so that is that is that is what Adam received from God when God breathed into his nostrils that that breath of eternal life amen perfect love came right with it Amen because remember when were what God is God is love agape love amen praise God I hope I hope everybody's understanding where I'm coming from next now look what brother Brown says here he says and he must have took her by the hand speaking of Adam - even we'd say this said let's take a little stroll darling that was mr. and mrs. you years ago and we took a little stroll and they went down through the garden and the first thing you know there come a ferocious roar out of the jungle who was it it was Leo the Lion she couldn't get next slide scared she couldn't get scared wasn't nothing about her to scare she had perfect love and love casteth out fear amen and he Adam said come here leo I like that come here Eve you've never met you've never met it this I have called him the lion I've named everything here and he scratched him on the back of the neck and he me out like a kitty and followed them you see that that that's and we're destined to come back to that st. that's that's that's for sure that that's where we're coming back to amen we're and that's why we're the wades been mentioning lately but that's the reason why the the creation is grown and in travailing for this to be back they want to be led the leo the lion wants to be led what the tiger wants to be led wants to be able to be scratched by us on the back and purr like a kitty you see and you want that too and the reason why you want it and the lion wants it is because it's there hey man we just have to bring it to manifestation they men and you know what Saints it's trials and the problems that we are going through right now and the things and lot and there's life that's going to push that out of us amen I believe that with all my heart next slide so let's look at the law here for just a moment the law could not produce perfect love it couldn't Hebrews 719 says for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing and of a better hope did but by the which we draw nigh unto God so you see they with the law they were able to draw nigh onto God then give them eternal life they didn't give them perfect perfection in their soul but it draws them closer to God it was almost a form of salvation you see but it wasn't eternal life in their soul because the law made nothing perfect God's will was not to give his children to law right that's not what he wanted to give them but they wanted that and because they wanted that he gave it to them knowing that they were not going to be able to keep it and hoping that they were going to be able to realize I can't keep it and and of course that's why he came as as Jesus Christ and died for them and they were they think they couldn't realize well that they could not keep the law because even though Christ had come on the scene they were still yet trying to still keep the law and doing things on their own when Christ had already taken all that all the law upon himself so with the law with that law came worries it came from feared torment because they could not keep it that they were oh my goodness III didn't make such sacrifice today or I didn't I went past the time that I needed to to you know pass the Sabbath and all those different laws that they had you see they had all those things bombarded in mind and not being able to love God with all of their heart you see because they had to keep a book of rules you see and it wasn't what God even though it was God's Word it was still something that God knew that they were not going to be able to keep a child willingly obeying and respecting their parents is showing them love and the reason why if a child is showing them love and willingly respecting and obeying his parents it's probably because the parents are showing them that kind of love as well you see therefore the child responds that way as well but when a child is obeying a parent or showing respect but not doing it willingly or not doing it all with all his heart and and thinks that maybe is just doing it out of fear Amen there is it's probably because that's what the parent is displaying to them you see it's probably because that's what the parent is is showing them therefore they're just gonna respond back with fear you see so that's what the children of Israel we're almost almost like you see very few back there in the Old Testament could really you know David would express this I love the law I love the you know and things like that and and not be a burden but to a lot of them most of the time the children of Israel they would they would slack off from obeying God and in and it would become a burden for them and God knew that and God wanted them to realize that on their own but of course they didn't and then some people still live by the law today thinking that their own works will bring approval or disapproval from God and it can't you have to depend on what he's done for you already amen I've always said and something that's helped me as I was growing up because you know I grew up my first parts of my early years I grew up Catholic up to I was 12 years old or 10 years old and then Jehovah's Witness came knocking at our door but but but you know I grew up Catholic so I grew up with that mentality that there's something that I have to do to please God you know and and and so if you're not careful Hispanic people they tend to lean that way a lot Latino people that's one of the things you go to a Latin country and preach the Word of God to them they have that mentality that there's something that they got to do to the reverence you know to the pasture to the preacher you know and you have to kind of snap them out of that you know and say just believe God you know just have faith in God God's already done it for you you see you see and when you and when you can come to that and say Lord I can't save myself and I can't forgive my own sin you're the only one that can do it for me then you can have freedom and liberty and no fear to continue moving on you see but sometimes we're the ones who bring the condemnation on ourselves and God's trying to set us free take us out take us out from the from the spiritual quarantine that we're in there to get us free but we we we somehow lock ourselves back in you see and it's not God's fault it's your fault because you don't believe his word oh man praise God next now Jesus comes the storm this is one of my favorite examples of the peace of God you want to find a good example the peace of God just just look at Jesus sleeping on the boat while in the middle of the storm I don't know of any other example about the peace of God than that I mean you're in the back of a boat and I don't know exactly how big the bow is and I don't think it was a cruise liner either but it was enough for for the disciples to be in as well as him but he was in the middle of the storm sleeping obviously he was tired but because the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelled in him he couldn't help but display perfect love in the time in the time of fear you see that's the reason that's a great example of Jesus showing His perfect love casteth out all fear in the middle of a storm he knew who was in control you know that the sight Jesus had told him he said let's just go to the other side you can read that on Martin Martin chapter 4 verse 35 let's go to the other side the disciples should have known you know he's he's already healed many people things have already taken place they should have just said you know what we're gonna get to the other side we believe him because he says we're let's go to the other side so we're just gonna go go to the other side amen and you know and in this day Saints but I believe that God is Jesus is telling us the same thing the Word of God is telling us let's just move on to the other side amen praise God and we should just believe that he's gonna move us to the other side he's gonna move us ahead of ahead of this time amen aren't you thankful that there's a word that can take us to the other side amen praise God and so the disciples they should have known that but when the one the storm came oh you know it's just how we're happy you know roaring the boat oh you know rowing the boat of life and and it's fun you know when everybody's everything's going fine and dandy and you know in Mutt and your job is there and there's money in the bank and there's food in the pantry and all these kind of things but watch when the storm comes in all of a sudden what are you gonna do then are you gonna fear are you gonna believe God Jesus said so Jesus was sleeping in the boat during the storm said let's go to the other side and all the disciples have to do was just believe that and then after that when Jesus gets up the only thing is there why are you so fearful why didn't they have faith right the obviously they were not born again therefore they could not have perfect faith you see they could not have the faith that Jesus had because they were not born again exactly all right how many understand I hope that the listeners at home are understanding this a little bit next so you know as human beings as regular human beings that's just the the natural way of us for us to act they're in trouble sometimes but as a Christian saints we should not have to act that way you see brother Brown says this loving him always say we have faith we have love but if we had love we'd have faith for that is perfect love casteth out all fear and when fear is gone faith is perfect you're scared he won't you're scared he won't keep his word but I believe that he does and now we'll find what he did Amen so next slide now I like this I like this right here look what brother Branham says that faith is loves incentive now the word plainly states if you want to put this down in Galatians five and six and it's only mentioned in Galatians five but that's our that's right that faith worketh by love see faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is have love first and we'll get to that in just a moment because after all faith is loves incentive what is an incentive it's something that comes with the package you see a little bonus a bonus the main thing is the love faith is the bonus that comes with it you see but you cannot be born without born again without faith you see you have to have faith in order to be born again right incentive that's exactly what what faith is is an incentive to love now you if you don't have love you can't have faith see next slide okay all right so I thought that that was it so you have to have now I put the statue of a perfect man here and I hope I hope this is understanding even if I'm wrong you tell me a birthday you tell me if I'm wrong because you are born again at faith right Christ is the foundation right which which gives you eternal life in your soul right Amen that eternal life is perfect love in your soul that's the reason why brother Branham just now said that he said that you can't have perfect love without faith oh but you can have faith without love they meant because love and eternal life is the same thing you see that eternal life is perfect love in your soul having access to this perfect love allows you to access faith in the time of need you see there's a there's a connection there's there's a constant connection here back and forth back and forth so potentially when you have the new birth you have all of this right in your soul it's just that the Holy Ghost as you're living and you're feeding more off the Word of God it's pushing these these things from your from your life into your life to express it on the outside man you see but all of this is already ends here so the why why should we worry Saints ask you at home why should we worry what can a coronavirus do to us what can man do to us amen when we have all of God in us you see praise God from grace to faith from faith to grace and love you see praise God next slide it's all Jesus Christ from faith to love Grace and back amen it's just kind of like I kind of say it's kind of like a like oh if you just kind of look at it carnally like an electricity just going back and forth back and forth it's a full connection you see Jesus is the cornerstone as much as he is the headstone you see he is the cornerstone he is the foundation a man just as much as he is the headstone praise God it's all one unit Christ in you the hope of glory so we are striving to manifest all of those virtues on this outside man praise God so this is this is what we striving for in this our saints but you you have to be born again at faith amen and when you born again amen that perfect love already resides in you now there's many times when and we'll look at here in just a moment but brother Branham there was times where he displayed that perfect glove in his life the the Raging Bull coming at him now he didn't he wasn't he he wasn't it he had not finished you know all of the stature of a perfect man in his life but yeah he was able to display that perfect love in his life you see I don't know if you understand what I'm what I'm saying because why that perfect love resided in him and in the time of need it came to - it came to to show forth you see all right examples of perfect love in action and this is an image when Peter and the disciples came out preaching to the to the three thousand Amen they were there they were there you know they went in there scared they went in there fearful but when he came out of it when they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul there was none of that after that there was boldness after that you see and that's what a born-again Christian has a man boldness to continue no matter who's making fun of me no matter what happens I'm still gonna move on with God's Word why because God's Word has taken the preeminence in my life amen so brother Branham he stops a charging bull we just talked about but the Branham stops a maniac from charging towards him and seed by in the campaign's maniac wanted to fight to to to to hurt him and and in brother Branham all he say he said he felt sorry for the man he loved the man rather than then oh okay alright let's go then from the pulpit you know he didn't do that no he said he said he just loved a man and that love caused that man to get out and down on his knees amen and of course Peter and the disciples were not afraid anymore after receiving the Holy Ghost amen that perfect love that dwelled in them you see amen next slide now as I mentioned earlier perfect love usually shines brighter during trials and tribulations and Jesus on the cross he could he could say at that moment Father forgive them for they know not what they do no fear he knew what he knew what was happening he was he was he was a there was no fear there was no condemnation there was nothing it was just perfect love being man if this blade and he could love those that were striking him he could love those that were putting they're putting him on that cross and so much that he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do and and because that fullness that dwelled in him when it's passed down to his children Stephen could do the same thing as well later on Stephen when he was being when he was being stoned and others later did the same exact thing as they were dying for their faith he they said the same thing Father forgive them for they know not what they do and you see Saints no matter what happens right now no matter what's going on there you know there it it makes me just draw closer to God it makes me love those that they're unlovable more and it should because you know there's many things that could be taken you know we hear the news we sometimes we don't know what they're not telling us but at the same time Saints no matter what happens you know this thing has to wind down so in some way or another and if they're holding like your thing brother doe said a couple of weeks ago they're holding a gun to your head what can you say at that moment do you just love it do you just love those that love you or can you still love in the midst midst of wolves that's that's a big that's a big question that shows if that perfect love resides and you are not or are you or are you gonna get vengeful are you gonna just go back hit hit back you know Jesus Christ didn't do that neither did Stephen and many of the other ones that died for the faith didn't do it either amen praise God next so how would do we obtain this perfect love is just a simple remedy get born again get born again receive the Word of God as you receive the word and believe it and it's revealed to you that makes you a candidate more for the Holy Ghost more of God more of God in you amen it's not up it's not something difficult it's as simple as getting born again a true birth will bring the sea to that will cast out fear amen the perfect love casting out for your next lot have boldness in the Day of Judgment first John 4:17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment in other words in the in the day of trouble right you see we know that with the believer doesn't have to go through the judgment but in the day of trouble because they let me tell you if you're a Christian you're gonna go through troubles and don't tell me that we're not going through troubles right now as difficulties are coming or have come and difficult more difficulties are coming on our way you need to assure be secure and sure that you have this boldness this perfect love dwelling within you amen boldness so that we hear and as I love made perfect that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment because as he is so are we in this world and I like that because it's present tense so are we in this world so Saints this is your time to put in action what God has placed in you amen it is your time to shine don't look at this as as something that negative and yes it's bad it's terrible but look at it this is my time to shine and I'm not going to be able to shine any other way amen this is my time for that's for that sweet juice a man of the Orangemen when you're when you want to eat an orange that it can only be squeezed out it can only come out when it's squeezed this is our time to shine and if it's not the time a mint for the coming of the Lord or for the things that they are promised in the word to still be fulfilled amen we're at Lisa it helps it trains us amen it trains us because surf certain that time is coming amen praise God I think that's it or may might be another slide oh yes bourbon says I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love the love of God I think that the love of God causes desperation you see Saints we you know the children of Israel they were laxed and they were everything when everything was going fine in Goshen they had they had jobs they had you know the family was fine and everything was going good but when Pharaoh started putting in and started coming in with with laws and regulations and things like that that's what caused them to go into desperation then you see but we shouldn't allow we shouldn't have that those things ain't meant to bring us into desperation we should always be in desperation desperation for our children that need the Lord in desperation for the for the for the for the abominations that end in the sins that are done in the land amen but are those who cry inside for the sins the sins that are done in the land amen I think that the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way they are it'll throw you into desperation I believe it will brother Brendan sir amen next slide now let's just read here in Romans chapter eight and with we're gonna finish Roman scepter a very familiar scriptures to us but look what Paul says here what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us there is I don't see anywhere where fear fits in that you see who shall separate us from the love of Christ the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us do you know that you and I are the most powerful people here on this earth day man it's not any government is not any man it's not Bill Gates it's it's you amen you're the most powerful man man and woman in the world right now and the world has no clue for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord and if you are in Christ amen then that love dwells in you that's why I can't you can't be separated from that love you see because your God in flesh in this day amen and-and-and-and those there there is the ones that you know who have the Spirit of God amen those that that not deny but confess that Christ has come in the flesh that Christ is here right now in flesh in you and I hey Maury praise God I believe that's it so I hope that somebody got a blessing out of that and and understand that love casts out fear amen right it's not something difficult is not something complicated it's just simple get the new birth in your life amen and that fear right man whatever it is fear whatever it'll go away you'll be able to face whatever and it wouldn't bother me one bit why because I know God's in control amen he's in control of my life and he's in control of the present day in the present day things you know Saints I was mentioning to a brother this week and I said you know you know Satan you know is is just a tool in the gut in the in the hands of God is what brother Branham said Satan is just a tool and you know he could maybe there there's there's a certain anointing right now going on in the world certain men are being anointed to to put out certain laws and do certain things and stuff like that but they they're just anointed by Satan amen and then Satan thinks that he's got it all under control but he's just a tool being used by God in order to express to for his word to come to be manifested to take place you see and so God's allowing this amen for you and I to shine in this hour amen to shine in this hour so take advantage of it hey man praise God how many love the Lord and then brother brother boy if you want to come kind of cut it cut it short this this evening but I hope that you got something out of that [Music] praise the Lord Saints what wonderful times that we live in in this hour you know brother Brandon was asked he said what age would you have rather lived and a lot of people may have said well I'd love to live in the days of Jesus that's wonderful to see and to feel and to hold Jesus hand and hug his neck and to kiss him and touch even to just touch the border of His garment that would have been wonderful or maybe in the days of when Wesley and then they were preaching a Great Awakening you know during that time and there was a revival taking place Charles Spurgeon and all those out man I would have loved to sit down and listen to Charles Spurgeon you know he's one of my my favorite preachers back then you know I would have loved to listen to him but you know what brother Branham said that this day is the is the best day is that I wouldn't I wouldn't trade this day for another day and that was back in the 50s and 60s when he said that so can you say the same thing because there some people are still living back in that era spiritually they are but you know what we are here in this present hour what are you going to do with what God has given you in this present hour it can't serve you back in the 40s 50s and 60s because that's that's a day gone by but the word is still the same amen and so if that words in you amen then it's your time to display manifest that word to a dying world amen brother boy yeah my word would love us even let me walk Blessed Lorien the way that was gone leading training to the land above give me cheer everywhere I feel my way every day well I feel my way every day with love as I walk with the heavenly dove they peek over wall the wall with a song and

clap of praise hallelujah praise the Lord thank God a man I believe brother wait he's got a few words so come on by the way thank you we are practicing our social distancing tonight so we must practice it from here back for all of you that are that are online we're going to have to change our program for Sunday it looks like number one we could not get the FM transmitter we ordered it and the guy turned the order down or cancelled the order so we can't do that so now we're going to go in a different direction we will be working on it so you won't be able to set in your cars and listen to the FM radio and we were going to put brother Dale outside like I said before but now they're saying there's a hundred percent chance of rain so if it rains what we're going to try to do is is have a service in here just like we normally do with the ten or ten or eleven people in the building and if you want to sit outside they're working on extending the Wi-Fi outside to where you can sit in your car and pick it up on your phone you will you will need a youtube app if you don't already have one you'll need a youtube app on your phone so that you can pick that up and we can live stream while you're sitting in your car outside even with it raining and with window rolled up you should still be able if you want to come now that's your option or you can stay home and watch it online but that's your that's your decision but you won't be able to come in here and only maybe to use the bathroom one person at a time like we said before because we'd still want our social distance we want to make sure that that this thing does not we don't we're not in the news because several churches and different ones have been in the news of saying well whatever we're going to have it and then they have an outbreak so like I said always before we don't want to tempt God we're not going to do that we have faith and we believe that God will keep will look at us I mean even in Gainesville Georgia there's 200 people with the virus and this is no desk so I mean that's kind of not ain't strange is god this is the county we live in we live in Hall County we live in Banks County there's just a few cases there so we need to keep our deficits distancing and also brother Dale will not be able to shake your hands when I'm going to shake any hands we may run a run you threw up under the bottom those of you that come and remember when I told you those are you to come underneath no shaking hands but you can roll the window down and say hey to brother Dale he will be in full hazmat gear and Darth Vader style you know but no just kidding we will have a face mask on I'm in a mask just for his protection he's the oldest one in the building right now so we want to protect our we don't protect our elderly and our older ones yeah so anyway we want to do it but really we don't want to wouldn't like brother we said we don't want to make fun of this thing it's serious there's people dying every minute of this thing and it's the older and a lot of the different ethnical groups that are have let's just make sure we keep praying that God will keep it away from us because we have a God like brother we've Lewis said that that I was talking about the Claude today he said to tell everybody hello they're doing the same thing and he made a wonderful statement he said you know what brother wait he said I don't fear death he said by do fear dying and if you'll think about that that's exactly true you can't walk up and say I don't fear nothing you know shoot me in the head no you're gonna have a little butterflies going on here because you know we don't fear death we've already died but we do fear died and the part of dying would be that stinking virus out there that this really suffocates you to death and it's really if you get into it it's just it's horrible and but we don't want to do that we want to come here if you can like I said before I'll send a text message out just like brother Bob did before and on Facebook to tell everybody exactly what we're going to do once we get everything brother Richard brother Anderson both Joe Josh and all the different ones are working on it to where we can get Wi-Fi extended out there where you can all watch it in your cars then when the service is over you can drive by and see brother Dale but now I do need brother Joe can you come out I meant to ask you this we still need a count right do we need to count to find out how many people are going to come yeah your name it would help okay so those of you that are going to come to the service Sunday morning same thing 10 o'clock be here at 9:30 nothing's changed with the service one service brother Dale's preaching but if you're going to come and participate in the parking lot we kind of need to know how many of you are going to come so you can send me a text message call me on the phone our brother Bob contact me or him nobody else me or him just call me or him so they'll keep it off everybody else brother Bob and myself he'll be sending it out my numbers on there just like it was before so remember it's still Easter Sunday we want to have a service we want you to be here if you want to be here or you can sit at home but we're gonna try to fix it where you can watch it bring your iPad or bring your they can bring your computer they can bring your lap you

iPad can go get in the car with somebody that does their you've messed your social distancing up we want to keep families with families ok come with who you come with and leave with who you came with

families and that Sunday will have a wonderful Easter sunrise service there after the Sun comes up but have an Easter Sunday service Lord we honor you every day we don't need a honoring of the Resurrection in one day of the year we honor your resurrection we are part of your resurrection every day 365 days of the year Lord but we take this one day knowing that 2,000 years ago somewhere
