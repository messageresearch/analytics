[14:20] Redemption like in one message from the

[14:25] of the Redemptive plan of God and I hope
[14:28] that you will uh listen to it and enjoy
[14:32] it may say some things that we haven't
[14:34] said before but we'll try to to make it
[14:37] as scriptural as we can and then to show
[14:40] you what we believe and what we're
[14:41] looking forward to and then we will for
[14:44] the afternoon have questions and answers
[14:47] so just you know put that into your to
[14:50] your
[14:51] thinking says the revelation of Jesus
[14:54] Christ which God gave unto him to show
[14:55] unto his servants things which must
[14:57] shortly come to pass
[14:59] and he sent and signified it by his
[15:01] Angel unto his servant John who by
[15:04] record of the word of God and the
[15:06] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[15:07] things that he saw blessed is he that
[15:10] readeth and they that hear the words of
[15:12] this
[15:13] prophecy keep those things which are
[15:15] written there in for the time is at hand
[15:18] the time to understand remember
[15:21] now it saying the words of this
[15:25] prophecy until something is made
[15:28] manifest
[15:30] it is a prophecy right right that's
[15:34] right it's a
[15:35] prophecy Until It's Made manifest it was
[15:38] a prophecy that a child would be born
[15:41] see that was a prophecy speaking of it
[15:45] proclaiming it declaring it but one day
[15:48] a child was born and there was no
[15:49] prophecy anymore it was the truth okay
[15:53] we're speaking of a prophecy here of
[15:55] this six seal but one day it will be
[15:58] real amen right amen 12th verse 6th
[16:04] chapter and I beheld when he had open
[16:07] the six seal and low there was a great
[16:08] earthquake and the sun became black as
[16:10] sa Claus of high and the moon became as
[16:13] blood and the stars of Heaven fell unto
[16:16] the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[16:19] untimely figs when she is shaken of A
[16:21] Mighty Wind and when the Heaven and the
[16:24] heaven departed as a scroll when it is
[16:28] rolled together
[16:29] together and every mountain and every
[16:31] island were moved out of their places
[16:34] and the kings of the earth and the great
[16:36] men and the rich men and the chief
[16:38] captains and the Mighty Men And every
[16:41] bondman and every Freeman hid themselves
[16:43] in the dens and in the rocks of the
[16:45] mountains and said to the mountains and
[16:47] rocks fall on us and hide us from the
[16:49] face of him that sth on the throne and
[16:53] from the Wrath of the lamb for the great
[16:57] day of his wrath has come and who shall
[16:59] be able to stand you may be seated the
[17:03] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[17:05] the
[17:07] word then we want to read
[17:09] the as we did this
[17:12] morning
[17:14] Matthew the 24th
[17:17] chapter and
[17:20] reading
[17:22] verse 29 and
[17:26] 30 immediately after the tri of those
[17:29] days shall the sun be darkened and the
[17:31] moon shall be shall not give her light
[17:33] and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and
[17:36] the powers of the heaven shall be shaken
[17:38] then shall appear the sign of the son of
[17:40] man in heaven and then shall all the
[17:42] tribes of the earth mourn and they shall
[17:45] see the son of man coming in the Clouds
[17:47] Of Heaven with power and great Glory all
[17:51] right now the reason I'm reading that
[17:53] one in relation on
[17:56] this mourning and dis
[17:59] afternoon is because of the the three
[18:03] questions that was asked the Lord Jesus
[18:05] in Matthew 24 you know what will be the
[18:08] time that there won't be one stone left
[18:10] on another we know that was Titus in
[18:13] ad70 and what shall be the sign of thy
[18:16] coming and of the end of the world so
[18:18] the sick seal ends the world all right
[18:22] but the sign of his coming is the sign
[18:24] of the son of
[18:26] man right which means that the seals has
[18:32] opened right cuz the seals is dealing
[18:34] with the son of man right the son of man
[18:38] the the word made flesh amen the prophet
[18:41] entered his
[18:43] ministry he was in the ministry of
[18:46] restoration up until the time of the
[18:48] opening of the
[18:49] seals and then when he did he entered
[18:53] into the ministry he was to
[18:55] bring and the son of man was brought
[18:58] into view as we were talking about the
[19:00] other day of Luke 17:30 in the day when
[19:04] the son of man would be revealed all
[19:06] right so they asked him a question and
[19:09] what will be the sign of thy
[19:12] coming he answered that in the opening
[19:14] of the
[19:15] seals he answered those three questions
[19:18] that I said this morning all right and
[19:21] what did we read in in Mark I mean in in
[19:23] Matthew 24 that it deals with in the six
[19:27] seal it will talk about the son of man
[19:30] do we know that this son of
[19:32] man I may not get finished I may have to
[19:36] have a message or two on this but this
[19:39] son of man would start in our
[19:42] day right be revealed made known but
[19:47] that Luke 17:30 will have to go to
[19:52] Israel because that's who will be there
[19:55] right the son of man and those two
[19:58] Prophets and will finally come to the
[20:00] position of his coming to
[20:04] Israel all right see that's Matthew uh
[20:07] what is it about
[20:09] 17 where he goes up on the mountain you
[20:11] know and the disciples go with him and
[20:13] when they get up on the mountain then
[20:15] you know he shows him Moses and elas and
[20:18] the order brother around said of his
[20:21] second
[20:22] coming the order of his second coming to
[20:26] the bride is what the word being
[20:27] revealed to you and I
[20:29] to purage us do what we were talking
[20:31] about this morning set us free get us
[20:35] clean uh wipe out our sins bring us to
[20:39] recognition of ourselves and then to
[20:43] come into the basis of changing these
[20:46] bodies that we're living in all right so
[20:49] then if you'll read future home you'll
[20:52] see more about what I'm talking about
[20:55] then see this world we are stepping we
[20:58] are a step ahead of the world in our
[21:02] Redemptive because we get a change of
[21:04] the body here right then the world has
[21:06] to go through a
[21:08] cleansing an ending of the world order
[21:11] as we ended up this morning talking on
[21:13] the six seal being the end of the
[21:16] world all right then it would come forth
[21:18] as being the the end of
[21:22] that and see then it will get a fiery
[21:25] baptism this world will but we're of it
[21:29] because that we're in the Redemptive
[21:30] plan we're the Bride of Jesus Christ am
[21:33] so then we can can see a little more
[21:36] about what we're talking about all now
[21:38] remember how we ended up talking about
[21:40] the prophet said they would have to be
[21:42] such a
[21:45] purging under that six seal that it
[21:48] would make ready a world for the
[21:53] Millennium that was what we ended up
[21:55] talking about you know where he said
[21:57] that the six seal is the end of the
[21:58] world that's paragraph 425 of The Sixth
[22:01] Seal and it was talking about getting
[22:03] ready for the
[22:05] Millennium all right see you and I as I
[22:09] kept emphasizing must be brought to a
[22:12] purging to us to be able to be
[22:16] prepared for a change of the
[22:19] body right and then we will go into the
[22:23] Millennium we don't go into the
[22:25] Millennium and then get a change of the
[22:26] body right we we are ahead of the world
[22:29] we're ahead of everything amen because
[22:31] we're the Bride of Jesus
[22:33] Christ
[22:35] now see what I want us to think on for
[22:38] this message today
[22:41] that I want you to think about that
[22:45] there's only six seals on the Plan of
[22:49] Redemption now the Seven Seals don't
[22:51] misunderstand me anybody don't hear me
[22:54] first time they don't understand me but
[22:56] remember the seventh seal is not written
[22:59] right and it says silence in heaven for
[23:01] space a half hour and there is no
[23:05] symbols like there was in 1 2 3 4 that
[23:10] the prophet had to
[23:11] break but then the fifth seal there was
[23:14] not any symbols it was
[23:18] people they given eternal life all right
[23:23] so you'll see why I kept I said that on
[23:25] each one all right and then in the seal
[23:29] there's not any
[23:31] symbols it tells you what it is the
[23:34] great earthquake and the great things
[23:35] that are taking place and and the moon
[23:37] tur into blood and all of the different
[23:40] things but see when you come to the
[23:43] seventh it just says silence in heaven
[23:46] for space of half hour all right then
[23:50] don't misunderstand when I keep
[23:52] repeating the six seals of
[23:57] redemption cuz that is that is the
[23:58] writing in the Bible it's written there
[24:01] in in the scriptures we
[24:04] read you know we've read chapter
[24:08] 6 up to verse what is verse
[24:13] 17 the entire
[24:15] chapter and then we've talked of it in
[24:17] Matthew
[24:19] 24 as to be the opening of the
[24:22] seals brother R said there was Jesus
[24:25] speaking it and he said and here's John
[24:28] writing it down in the scriptures all
[24:31] right he said and the third which was
[24:34] the confirmation is now God it's on the
[24:37] seventh seal I'm pretty sure is either
[24:40] that or the questions and answers that's
[24:42] what I've been listening to in when I've
[24:45] been deer honey is the six seal the
[24:47] questions and answers and the
[24:49] seven so then it's it's in the order
[24:53] now that there's only six seals written
[24:58] all right the seventh seal is not
[25:02] revealed okay so we can say there's six
[25:05] seals of
[25:07] redemption right and bring that into a
[25:10] position of understanding because the
[25:13] seventh seal won't give you a great
[25:15] mystery of
[25:17] redemption right I'll tell you what I
[25:20] think it
[25:21] is it is the product of redemption amen
[25:26] that's right it is the coming of the
[25:27] Lord amen your Prophet said amen it is
[25:31] the end of all
[25:32] things all right so then it is a lot to
[25:35] be understood there you know because
[25:38] that's the way the prophet has brought
[25:39] it unto us and like I said Jesus
[25:42] preached six seals he didn't preach the
[25:45] seven
[25:46] right why because that's what he was or
[25:49] who he was he was that God of the word
[25:53] and one day he'll be the god of the word
[25:55] again in the bride amen that's right
[25:59] to make a change in the body okay now in
[26:03] doing that then that's what I want us to
[26:05] think about I want us to think about the
[26:08] Plan of Redemption I said I'm laying
[26:10] this down to where we'll see this and
[26:12] then I'll come back and probably way to
[26:15] be preaching Wednesday cuz I want this
[26:17] to keep my mind in one channel and be
[26:21] able to uh I'll let him know when he
[26:23] gets here gets
[26:25] back and then that way I can got to keep
[26:28] my thought the way I want it to bring it
[26:31] and then we'll have questions and
[26:32] answers all right but let's get started
[26:34] on this point of what we're talking
[26:38] about and see it spoke of throughout the
[26:42] Bible said these seals I gave you that
[26:46] quote he said they're spoke of
[26:49] throughout the word he said they come
[26:50] all the way down
[26:52] through so we
[26:54] covered excuse me covered this morning
[26:57] of
[26:59] how that it was the
[27:01] purging we covered Wednesday how it was
[27:04] the the part of the you know the
[27:07] Judgment seal of the
[27:09] word the purging of everything the
[27:13] prophet said everything is purged under
[27:15] the sick
[27:16] seal all right so it'll make way for the
[27:20] Millennium to be able to come into
[27:24] view now let's think on this
[27:30] go ahead brother pull up number one
[27:31] let's get
[27:36] started everybody knows this story it's
[27:39] in the kinsman
[27:40] redeemer paragraph
[27:45] 175 he says we have the earnest of it
[27:48] now I've took home a whole scarf full of
[27:52] Arley all
[27:54] right he gave it to her now we know this
[27:57] is and Bo right measured it out six
[28:03] measures and watch
[28:05] it we always quoted it as Ruth
[28:11] receiving the seals all right hang on a
[28:14] second but we got to get the quote
[28:16] exactly right because if not somebody
[28:19] will come along and try to pull
[28:21] something with you of saying but that's
[28:23] not the way the quote is it doesn't say
[28:26] six se
[28:28] it
[28:29] says of the earth 6,000 years okay so
[28:33] let's start
[28:35] there he gave it to her and measured it
[28:37] out six measures six six meant the 6,000
[28:41] years of existence of the world man's
[28:45] day is six Man was created on the sixth
[28:48] day that'll be 6,000 years that the
[28:50] world was
[28:52] created and the 7,000 God rested 6,000
[28:56] years the church would labor against sin
[28:58] with the fire of God of these barley
[29:01] Loaves and then go into the Eternal rest
[29:05] that's rest wait six measures of fine
[29:07] barley
[29:08] what he put in there to carry her
[29:14] over till the time of full
[29:20] Redemption all right now the six
[29:22] measures of meal would mean the 6,000
[29:26] years
[29:29] are you with me yes all right but if
[29:32] that was put there would be to carry her
[29:37] over till the time of full
[29:42] Redemption all right the six measures of
[29:45] meal
[29:47] okay and we know we don't have to go
[29:49] through that I've got it but Ruth 53 and
[29:52] 15 if he measured out six measures of
[29:55] barley
[29:58] and put it into her bag and sent her
[30:01] back to
[30:02] Naomi and then when she got back to
[30:05] Naomi you know she showed her what she
[30:07] had she said just stay where you at
[30:11] don't bother no
[30:13] more and he'll take care of this Plan of
[30:16] Redemption now we know what he
[30:20] done he had to go and pay the price he
[30:22] had to kick his shoe off he had to allow
[30:25] uh Satan the opportunity which was our
[30:27] nearest King kman we were all born kin
[30:30] folks to the devil where we like it or
[30:32] not you didn't become kin folks to have
[30:34] you born kin folks right to the devil
[30:38] all right the new birth makes us kin
[30:40] folks to God okay so he gave her six
[30:43] measures of Meal which in other words he
[30:46] told
[30:48] her say where you're at I'll take care
[30:52] of it Naomi tells you just leave it
[30:55] alone he's done give you
[30:59] his promise of six measures of meal he's
[31:04] done give you his promise to
[31:06] redeem right right so now then how many
[31:10] seals are they in the Plan of
[31:13] Redemption written in the word there
[31:15] only six seals right so he gave her six
[31:20] measures of
[31:21] Meal which would mean the six Church
[31:23] ages you know or excuse me 6,000 years
[31:28] of the
[31:29] earth and in that 6,000 years of the
[31:32] Earth You and
[31:36] I the ru that we're talking about the
[31:39] bride we are to get the Plan of
[31:44] Redemption right right which is six
[31:50] seals cuz the seven don't reveal
[31:54] anything so we're going to get to six
[31:56] time six for the 6,000 years we're going
[31:59] to get six seals now go ahead to number
[32:08] three this is paragraph 162 or
[32:13] 52 the bridge between the church ages
[32:15] and
[32:16] sealed notice now the
[32:19] book remember it's sealed here's one
[32:23] here this the seal and another one's
[32:25] wrapped around see another one's wrapped
[32:27] around see it's a book of
[32:32] redemption the whole
[32:34] Bible is a book of
[32:36] redemption right it tells us what will
[32:40] happen in the 6,000 years of mankind
[32:46] that's
[32:47] right and don't go too far haywi Haywire
[32:51] with it but we've done past
[32:54] that as far as man can calculate
[32:59] but remember God don't calculate like we
[33:03] do right all
[33:06] right now there a book of redemption and
[33:10] the whole thing together makes a book
[33:12] and it's sealed with Seven
[33:15] Seals and it's on the backside is
[33:18] because it's wound up the seal Myster is
[33:21] on the inside it only says the white
[33:23] horse rider and black horse rider
[33:25] whatever on the outside but the mystery
[33:27] of the whole book is in them seals from
[33:30] Genesis to
[33:33] Revelation a complete Plan of Redemption
[33:36] is revealed in these Seven Seals All
[33:40] right now all we need to
[33:45] know
[33:47] is the Plan of
[33:51] Redemption but that's revealed to You
[33:54] and I by way of the prophet of God
[33:58] known as the
[34:01] seals people say well why they so
[34:05] important well if you don't want to be
[34:09] redeemed you're right it's not important
[34:13] that's right but if you want to be
[34:15] redeemed it's very
[34:17] important right then the prophet would
[34:19] say like in the Daniel 70 weeks if you
[34:21] don't understand these Daniel 7 ways you
[34:24] can't understand the seals
[34:28] right so why is it so important to
[34:29] understand the 70 weeks of
[34:31] Daniel because if you don't you can't
[34:35] understand the Plan of Redemption right
[34:38] what do you mean brother de I spoke
[34:41] tongue I believe the
[34:44] prophet I know all about one God water
[34:47] baptism no Eternal
[34:50] Hells do here
[34:57] plain language do
[34:59] you
[35:01] sure well then you didn't need the
[35:03] profit I
[35:08] guess but listen
[35:12] Church there's only six seals in that
[35:15] plan that's revealing something that's
[35:19] right making known something right all
[35:22] right look at the next
[35:25] one paragraph 392
[35:28] of the seventh
[35:31] seal did you notice when Jesus asked him
[35:34] that you know when we compared the
[35:37] scripture here with Matthew 24 with the
[35:39] six seals the seventh was left
[35:43] out because you see Christ said only God
[35:46] himself know not even the angel no it
[35:49] wasn't even written you see you see they
[35:54] hushed nothing take place then a Angels
[35:58] don't know it nobody knows when he's
[35:59] coming but it it'll be seven voices of
[36:02] these Thunders that will reveal the
[36:04] great Revelation at that
[36:06] time here now we find that the sick seal
[36:10] has been opened to
[36:12] us we see it and we know that this
[36:16] seventh seal it this seventh seal cannot
[36:19] be broke to the public until that hour
[36:23] arrives that's why people arguing over
[36:26] where the seventh seal Has Broken the
[36:27] Bible says it
[36:30] is all right but there's only six
[36:33] seals in it six
[36:38] seals to reveal the Plan of Redemption
[36:41] look at number
[36:44] five those that are in prison now at 138
[36:48] none of the six seal were these trumpets
[36:51] open remember under there we find out
[36:54] that the lamb came forth appeared on the
[36:56] scene he left him Mercy Seat his work of
[36:59] redemption was finished he came forth
[37:01] and took the book out of the right hand
[37:03] of him that sat upon the throne and time
[37:05] was no
[37:07] more
[37:13] now according to
[37:16] that and what we've always tried to
[37:20] preach then the lamb can't leave The
[37:23] Mercy Seat
[37:29] until after Redemption is
[37:33] over are you reading it that's
[37:36] right well you know there's going to be
[37:38] Redemption after we leave out of
[37:40] here
[37:46] right right
[37:48] amen there'll be
[37:51] 144,000
[37:53] right you got to deal with Israel right
[37:57] sealed youw that's
[37:59] blinded you got to deal with a lot of
[38:01] things you got to deal with the foolish
[38:03] virgin to be given eternal
[38:06] life so then we say redemption's over
[38:09] that's what they told me when they came
[38:10] into the message they said redemption's
[38:12] over 63 I said I'm sorry my Bible said
[38:16] it over for the foundation of the
[38:18] world
[38:21] right is not that the
[38:24] word I wasn't trying to be sarcastic I
[38:26] was trying to show the
[38:29] truth see the lamb leaving The Mercy
[38:33] Seat he cannot leave that Mercy Seat
[38:37] until that 144,000 is
[38:44] redeemed I thought he was he left The
[38:47] Mercy Seat come to
[38:51] us that's what I said you talk about one
[38:53] God
[38:58] we're just beginning to understand a
[39:01] little of the
[39:04] things the lamb has to stay on The Mercy
[39:08] Seat until Israel is saved that's
[39:17] right you see yeah but but that's where
[39:20] our butts come
[39:21] into we put our own thoughts in
[39:27] see we're looking at the word as it
[39:29] unfolds to show us the Plan of
[39:37] Redemption and we stand
[39:42] here already
[39:44] redeemed
[39:48] amen we get a change of the
[39:54] body and the Lamb's still on The Mercy
[39:56] Seat
[39:59] who
[40:00] f for
[40:02] Israel
[40:04] right so that's where we think of one
[40:07] God and we think well there's just one
[40:08] God you like you
[40:14] finger there's many forms of God that's
[40:21] right the lamb that leaves the mercy
[40:24] seat for you and I
[40:29] will take
[40:30] place and he'll become visible among us
[40:33] and take us into
[40:35] Rapture right but there'll still have to
[40:37] be a Plan of
[40:39] Redemption for Israel right that's
[40:43] right so God has many forms in
[40:48] morphes but he's only one
[40:52] person Richard and I been talking about
[40:55] this on the
[40:57] the things and I have them written down
[40:58] at the
[41:00] house cuz I was questioned that when we
[41:03] were speaking about the 70 weeks of
[41:05] Daniel that they said well will the
[41:08] marriage supper is only going to be 3
[41:09] and 1/2
[41:11] years said what are we going to
[41:14] do well that other three and a half
[41:16] years is going on y'all talking
[41:21] about you know what brother R
[41:25] says he said we're at to supper for 3
[41:28] and 1/2 years he said Jesus slips back
[41:30] down here and reveals himself to the
[41:33] Jews right right they don't come back in
[41:36] a Corporal body
[41:39] right that don't happen to the
[41:41] Millennium so a form of God can come
[41:44] down and reveal himself to the two
[41:47] witnesses in
[41:49] 144,000 and Jesus ain't left us
[41:52] yet amen but if you need other things
[41:57] brother around and said he said like it
[41:59] was in
[42:04] Joseph he said Joseph's wife was in the
[42:08] house of
[42:11] pharaoh you know the
[42:14] ruler where Joseph's house
[42:19] was
[42:21] right he didn't throw her out in the
[42:24] backyard she was living in a home she
[42:27] remained there in the Palace of
[42:32] pharaoh brother around says when Jesus
[42:34] comes
[42:37] back he said the wife will be in the
[42:41] house of the
[42:44] father
[42:46] right okay you just wait a while the
[42:49] Lord will take care of
[42:50] everything but listen
[42:54] Church the book of redemption
[42:59] the book of redemption is a book of
[43:01] names that's right right we've been
[43:03] through that right
[43:05] right it's not a scoffield Thompson
[43:08] Chain
[43:10] or
[43:12] whatever but it's the
[43:17] Bible it's the Bible that was written
[43:19] before the foundation of the
[43:21] world because all names were WR
[43:25] were placed there in a book of
[43:32] redemption now then you got to divide
[43:34] that up because if you don't you got a
[43:38] problem because you got the book of
[43:41] redemption revealing the bride's
[43:47] names but you know the foolish virgins
[43:51] names were in the book and
[43:54] remain the 144,000 's name was in the
[43:57] book and
[44:01] remain just not
[44:03] in the section where the little bright
[44:06] at so we'll get to that in a
[44:10] minute the book of
[44:13] redemption brother say it's just a book
[44:15] of
[44:16] names the Bible is the record of what
[44:20] the
[44:21] names are Peter James John
[44:25] Paul but then it cords around there
[44:28] what's taking
[44:30] place God is The Book of
[44:36] Life but the book of
[44:39] redemption said God opened one of the
[44:44] seals and John saw his
[44:50] name and did he open one of the seals
[44:52] back there to
[44:55] John or when the seals were broke to
[44:58] John on
[44:59] patmas is that when he saw his
[45:06] name you see we talk about Redemption
[45:10] but do we know about
[45:12] redemption or are we still like it was
[45:15] in the old days the old preacher said
[45:18] you ain't going to heaven if you ain't
[45:21] Born
[45:24] Again everybody that ain't born again
[45:28] here in this world going to
[45:32] hell well you know we've seen that a
[45:34] little different now
[45:36] happen when we start dealing with Israel
[45:40] when we start dealing with the foolish
[45:42] virgins when we start dealing with
[45:44] 144,000 come find that there going to be
[45:46] a lot more in heaven right
[45:51] right but you know everybody's going to
[45:53] be there because of what Jesus done MH
[45:57] that's the way it should have been
[45:58] preached that's right he paid the price
[46:01] for everybody that's right in the Plan
[46:04] of
[46:10] Redemption but it's the work of
[46:16] redemption see this
[46:18] book was what was redeemed in this book
[46:23] it was a book of redemption and
[46:25] everything that he had red
[46:27] redeemed was written in that
[46:34] book don't you think that he did at
[46:36] Calvary redeemed the foolish
[46:41] virgin it just wouldn't applied
[46:47] to he redeemed Israel wasn't
[46:51] applied he redeemed 144,000 wasn't
[46:55] applied
[46:59] there still part of the Plan of
[47:03] Redemption so I don't know about that
[47:05] okay go ahead and pull up the next
[47:08] one
[47:10] 155 sold that are in prison
[47:13] now the lamb had redeemed it but it
[47:16] could not come forth until every name
[47:20] was revealed
[47:27] and that was taking place under the
[47:30] Sixth
[47:33] Seal before the seven
[47:39] broke
[47:42] so all names are revealed under the sick
[47:47] seal what a great Redemption seal it is
[47:51] and yet we think it's not
[47:55] important I just tribulation
[47:58] period that's what people says when you
[48:00] try to get an emphasis on about the
[48:02] first seal and it it's just a white
[48:08] Rider what about one seal time the
[48:10] entire Bible
[48:12] together on the Plan of
[48:16] Redemption what about one seal it
[48:18] doesn't mention in any other he doesn't
[48:20] mention
[48:25] them all names are revealed under the
[48:28] Sixth
[48:29] Seal before the
[48:31] [Music]
[48:33] seventh
[48:36] broke through all names of Redemption
[48:39] all who will ever receive eternal
[48:45] life their name has to be in the
[48:52] book we start should be starting to get
[48:54] a point that
[48:59] The Plan of Redemption is becoming vital
[49:01] to us that's
[49:08] right even though we're not there when
[49:10] the actual seal
[49:14] breaks but as it's coming forth down
[49:17] through manifesting itself up Through
[49:20] the Ages and
[49:22] times our names appear
[49:30] every name if you listening to what he
[49:33] said all the names that'll ever be
[49:36] redeemed is revealed under the sick
[49:44] seal you want to write that down and
[49:47] just ponder that
[49:49] thought and you'll see why that I said
[49:52] that there's only six seals of
[49:54] redemption
[49:58] the seven doesn't reveal
[50:02] anything my brother said it's his
[50:08] coming look at the next
[50:12] one 125 the six
[50:16] seal he's talking
[50:18] about because prior to scriptures and
[50:20] all the great secret of mystery that was
[50:23] under this six seal
[50:27] of the book of
[50:28] redemption so that's under the six seal
[50:31] now remember these seals are in
[50:33] Mysteries and the six seals all together
[50:36] is one great big
[50:40] book just six scroll roll together it
[50:44] unwinds the whole book of
[50:47] redemption that's how the world was
[50:51] redeemed so there's only six
[50:53] seals in the Plan of Redemption
[50:57] but all names is revealed under the
[50:59] Sixth
[51:01] Seal so you don't need a seventh
[51:05] seal showing you some Plan of
[51:15] Redemption oh there one great big book
[51:19] right every name that will ever be was
[51:22] put on that book before the foundation
[51:24] of the world Amen
[51:32] and when the sick seal finally
[51:35] breaks in
[51:38] reality all
[51:40] names that would ever be there is there
[51:42] because even that foolish
[51:44] virgin is
[51:47] purged during that Great
[51:50] Tribulation she doesn't have white
[51:53] robes but she's purged
[52:01] 144,000 are
[52:06] purged that's when we look at it we just
[52:08] say the Bible or the book of
[52:20] redemption
[52:22] there's a question or a problem when
[52:24] you're studying the church age book
[52:29] and brother brandom tells us about
[52:32] it because in that church age
[52:36] book I ask you to
[52:39] read from page
[52:44] 266 I believe it is 264 where it starts
[52:47] with the names blotted out I ask you to
[52:51] read
[52:55] that and brother says that's going to be
[52:58] confusing of the two
[53:06] books but he said it's not two
[53:09] books that's
[53:11] right there's only one book right
[53:15] mhm with two
[53:18] sections
[53:21] amen one of them he said is The Book of
[53:23] Life
[53:29] there is no such thing as adding your
[53:31] name to the Lamb's Book of
[53:35] Life it was either written out before
[53:37] the foundation of the world or will
[53:38] never be written right
[53:45] amen but there's two sections of that
[53:48] one book one of them is The Book of
[53:53] Life you remember he told Judas for
[53:56] speaking about
[53:58] him Rejoice not that your names told the
[54:02] disciples are written in
[54:07] heaven you know judas's name was written
[54:10] in the book of
[54:11] life right but your Prophet
[54:15] said but not in the Lamb's Book of Life
[54:18] section that's
[54:19] right not in the Eternal section
[54:27] there two
[54:30] sections when you become a to a
[54:33] religious
[54:35] order in your journey of
[54:39] Christianity your name is written in the
[54:41] book of
[54:45] life that's why you're here on
[54:52] Earth that's not talking about the
[54:54] Lamb's Book of Life it was written
[54:56] before the foundation of the world
[55:01] right book of life has to do with your
[55:03] natural Life we'll read these in a
[55:08] second your life and your journey that's
[55:10] why I said this
[55:13] Bible this Bible speaks of Matthew Mark
[55:16] Luke
[55:19] John but at the same time it speaks of
[55:23] pharaoh and all of the people
[55:26] they were wrong all the Pharisees and
[55:29] think it speaks of them in this
[55:34] Bible that doesn't give them eternal
[55:36] life because their name is written in
[55:39] the
[55:42] Bible but it does mean that they had a
[55:45] part to do with the religious order of
[55:48] their
[55:51] day now watch that as we go
[55:54] along you see
[55:59] a complete Plan of Redemption is written
[56:02] in the
[56:05] Bible but there's only six seals written
[56:07] in this Bible right the Seven's not
[56:10] written right this say silence for space
[56:15] half an
[56:17] hour all right we'll get down to that
[56:20] when we get into the seventh seal and
[56:23] the ability to be able to receive from
[56:24] under that because of what we studied
[56:27] down through the
[56:31] seals but there's only six seals to
[56:33] reveal its plan and if we're not part of
[56:37] that six seals as it reveals the ages
[56:40] and the times and the people and who it
[56:42] is and
[56:45] whatever don't worry about it we won't
[56:47] be
[56:48] there
[56:51] right but because of you being here
[56:54] today
[56:56] you're part of a religious
[57:00] order cator around and I'm quoting from
[57:03] Brother Bram worship of
[57:09] God your name can be in the book of life
[57:16] section and not be in the Eternal
[57:21] section that's where these other people
[57:23] will come up when we get into the Plan
[57:25] of Redemption
[57:27] I'm trying to make a foundation for this
[57:29] I may have to preach Wednesday to get
[57:32] that point
[57:37] across but all names are
[57:40] revealed under the six
[57:47] seal whether or not you're going to
[57:50] be right or whether you're going to be
[57:53] Israel if they're listening or foolish
[57:58] virgins if our names are not in the
[58:02] book you remember the prophet when he
[58:05] was saying the people say oh my name was
[58:07] written you know the other night written
[58:09] he said there's no such
[58:11] thing it was written before the
[58:13] foundation of the world or it'll never
[58:15] be written that's right that's
[58:19] right but what about Judas could walk
[58:21] with Jesus for three and 1/2 years
[58:27] part of a religious Order cast out
[58:29] Devils heal the
[58:31] sick preach the
[58:36] gospel and his name was taken
[58:41] out
[58:44] okay so that's what makes it confusing
[58:47] he said let's just read a few things if
[58:49] I don't get this part of I'll get the
[58:51] rest that Wednesday go ahead with number
[58:54] nine
[58:57] this is PR 119 Works Express works and
[59:01] Faith
[59:02] Express just like last night speaking
[59:05] when you get the
[59:06] book you're going to see maybe he
[59:09] talking about the church age
[59:10] book cuz it didn't come out until up in'
[59:14] 65 all right the church age book was put
[59:17] out long in '
[59:19] 65 it wasn't brother Thomas and him back
[59:22] I know it wasn't put out when it was
[59:25] written down that was when brother R was
[59:27] preaching brother Lil took and reg
[59:29] grammar IED it in time it came out in
[59:33] 65 now just like last night speaking
[59:36] when you get the book you're going to
[59:39] see maybe a little confusion there of
[59:41] what I said the two books of
[59:47] life it's the same
[59:52] book is that what I've just been saying
[59:55] right but one of them is your natural
[59:59] birth the other one is your spiritual
[1:00:04] birth one leads
[1:00:06] out to the
[1:00:09] other go ahead with the next
[1:00:11] one invisible Union par 26 204
[1:00:18] 205 here brings into view the two books
[1:00:22] that's going to be mysterious when you
[1:00:24] read the book of The Seven Church
[1:00:27] ages the two books book of life said one
[1:00:30] says you can put your name on
[1:00:33] it you never comes you never comes off
[1:00:37] other one says you take his name out of
[1:00:40] The Book of
[1:00:43] Life these things is perfectly in view
[1:00:45] right here he said I'm going to try to
[1:00:48] explain it the two books
[1:00:56] what happens to an
[1:01:00] individual I'm trying to get this down
[1:01:02] to where that I can just run through the
[1:01:04] plan and you'll say that was message so
[1:01:06] and so so and so so and
[1:01:10] so and when you come into the
[1:01:13] world we don't believe you came into the
[1:01:15] world with eternal life right I don't
[1:01:18] believe that I don't believe the prophet
[1:01:20] taught it that
[1:01:21] way got a quote work said always was
[1:01:24] eternal yeah read the quot
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:27] if you have eternal life right right
[1:01:30] right you don't read that
[1:01:32] part you come in the world with eternal
[1:01:35] life Jesus Christ died in vain
[1:01:40] amen why the prophet say always was
[1:01:43] eternal if you have eternal life that
[1:01:45] eternal life you have always was eternal
[1:01:50] God is a part of God's own life
[1:01:54] Zoe we in the world is lost
[1:02:02] people then we begin
[1:02:04] to maybe think about God getting a
[1:02:07] little concerned
[1:02:09] and we started going to
[1:02:12] church we begin to hear a message that
[1:02:15] we must be
[1:02:18] saved and as we
[1:02:21] do we begin to get relation to that you
[1:02:24] know and we get new
[1:02:26] the stages of our journey of
[1:02:28] justification as we call it
[1:02:33] sanctification we become part of a
[1:02:35] religious order of
[1:02:37] people you know what
[1:02:39] happened God writes your name in a
[1:02:46] book not the Eternal
[1:02:50] section that's written for the
[1:02:51] foundation of the world all right he
[1:02:54] puts your name in the book
[1:02:58] let's see if that's
[1:03:01] true go ahead to number
[1:03:04] 11 page 272 of the sardian church age
[1:03:08] which church age
[1:03:11] book now I am sure that you have noticed
[1:03:14] that those whose names were in The Book
[1:03:16] of
[1:03:17] Life were part of the religious
[1:03:20] order of that day that centered around
[1:03:23] the true God In Worship of him though
[1:03:25] they did not worship according to True
[1:03:27] Word like Judas they didn't go all the
[1:03:30] way but their name was
[1:03:34] written in the
[1:03:37] book see if you take the
[1:03:40] Bible and think about
[1:03:46] it you think about those names that were
[1:03:49] written in the L's book of
[1:03:51] life before the foundation of the world
[1:03:55] and then you think about that one day
[1:03:57] you came to
[1:04:00] Earth and you became a human mortal lost
[1:04:03] doomed right but you begin
[1:04:07] to go to churches in said you begin to
[1:04:11] being associated with
[1:04:15] religious matters in
[1:04:19] people you know what when God puts your
[1:04:21] name in the book what he done to Judas
[1:04:24] if you read what I gave you 266 to 280
[1:04:27] something of the church age book you
[1:04:30] hear him explaining four classes of
[1:04:35] people which we never would have thought
[1:04:37] about all of those things one of them is
[1:04:39] the Bride of Jesus Christ her name is
[1:04:41] written in the lamb book of life before
[1:04:44] the foundation of the world number two
[1:04:47] is people whose names were written in
[1:04:50] the Book of
[1:04:52] Life and they'll go on one day and
[1:04:54] receive eternal life
[1:04:57] number three is people like Judas who
[1:05:00] had his name written there but had his
[1:05:03] name
[1:05:09] taken number four is people that were
[1:05:12] never written
[1:05:13] nowhere said now no doubt there is a
[1:05:17] record written of
[1:05:20] them and right here it
[1:05:23] is the Bible
[1:05:26] right right this is the record of all
[1:05:29] four classes of people we just talked
[1:05:33] about this record tells of a
[1:05:36] people whose names were written in the
[1:05:39] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:05:40] foundation of the world Jesus Christ
[1:05:42] stood as a lamb slain and they will
[1:05:45] receive eternal life here in this world
[1:05:48] as part of the body of
[1:05:51] Christ there is a group here that
[1:05:55] becomes religious and part of an
[1:05:58] order and they'll give their life for
[1:06:00] the
[1:06:01] gospel but they have to go to the white
[1:06:03] Throne to receive eternal life because
[1:06:06] their name is not in the eternal life
[1:06:10] section it's only the end of pages of
[1:06:13] this
[1:06:14] book of The Natural
[1:06:17] Life out here then there's people like
[1:06:21] Judas that'll have his name removed
[1:06:27] and you know we think about how hard it
[1:06:31] would be to have a name removed not very
[1:06:36] hard all you got to
[1:06:39] do is blashe the Holy
[1:06:41] Ghost
[1:06:47] right all it tell
[1:06:50] you you blashe the Holy Ghost but Jesus
[1:06:53] said he won't be forgiven and this world
[1:06:56] or the world to come that's what he
[1:06:58] said right he said how hard or what
[1:07:01] would you do to bless me just make some
[1:07:04] front of
[1:07:06] somebody see somebody shouting and you
[1:07:09] laugh at
[1:07:10] them see somebody with long hire you
[1:07:14] make fun of
[1:07:19] them you're a preacher preaching under
[1:07:21] the anointing of the Holy Ghost and you
[1:07:24] life at what is being said it or
[1:07:28] denied is say
[1:07:31] wrong you Blas me in the Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost what did the Bible say what did
[1:07:37] the prophet
[1:07:38] say blaspheming the Holy Ghost is not
[1:07:41] just drinking gambling smoking running
[1:07:43] around with women and stuff like
[1:07:46] that the blashe the Holy Ghost is
[1:07:48] attribute the works of God to the devil
[1:07:53] amen that's the summing up of the whole
[1:07:55] old thing when you attribute the works
[1:07:58] of God to the devil in other words when
[1:07:59] you say that's the devil doing that
[1:08:02] that's the devil that made that sister
[1:08:05] where long
[1:08:09] haire that's the devil that made him not
[1:08:12] wear you know long I made them wear long
[1:08:15] dresses and not wear short one cut their
[1:08:18] hair and
[1:08:20] things that's blaspheming the holy
[1:08:23] ghost that won't be forgiven in this
[1:08:25] world the world to
[1:08:29] come because it's God keeps a record yes
[1:08:33] sir but
[1:08:36] listen part of a religious
[1:08:40] order puts your
[1:08:43] name in the book of
[1:08:50] life eternal life by the baptism of the
[1:08:53] Holy Ghost reveals to you that your name
[1:08:55] name has always been
[1:08:57] written did you understand the way I
[1:08:59] stated
[1:09:01] that to have your name in The Book of
[1:09:03] Life is
[1:09:05] good but that's not eternal
[1:09:10] life one leads out to the other the
[1:09:12] prophet
[1:09:15] said but the lounge Book of Life is
[1:09:17] eternal life you receive eternal life
[1:09:20] you can never be
[1:09:21] lost brother Mo used to make a good
[1:09:23] point about it he said you can't sin
[1:09:25] enough to be lost if you're bornn again
[1:09:28] course if you're born again you're not
[1:09:30] going to try to sin very
[1:09:32] long right right people go on and they
[1:09:35] live like the devil for 20 years and say
[1:09:38] I've been born again but I just backslid
[1:09:40] now ain't no Bible for that the only the
[1:09:44] statements that your Prophet gave in the
[1:09:46] Hebrew Book was of the man that went out
[1:09:49] and was a preacher and sat down and got
[1:09:51] drunk a couple of weeks later he died
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:56] God ain't going to let you Mar his name
[1:09:58] for 40
[1:09:59] years but don't make
[1:10:03] excuses well I've been saved now all
[1:10:06] youve
[1:10:07] lost right and remember what we brought
[1:10:10] out this morning if you don't admit
[1:10:12] you're lost you're under
[1:10:16] condemnation and need a purging from
[1:10:20] that
[1:10:22] thought the best thing to do is say I'm
[1:10:24] lost I need salvation yes Lord but now
[1:10:29] brother if I say I'm
[1:10:31] WR then I'm afraid I might be
[1:10:35] lost well if you say you're saved and
[1:10:37] ain't saved ain't much better
[1:10:41] off right amen you can't at least keep
[1:10:45] saying until God comes on the scene
[1:10:47] right but think about
[1:10:52] it you know when your name goes on the
[1:10:54] book as a believer
[1:10:56] have a number 12
[1:11:01] brother what's your Prophet had to
[1:11:04] say his questions and ansers real three
[1:11:07] 64 8:30 the morning service paragraph
[1:11:10] 295 sanctification is when your name
[1:11:13] goes on the book as a
[1:11:17] Believer that's part of a religious
[1:11:19] order we just got through
[1:11:21] read your name is wrote in this Blood
[1:11:24] see sanctification does
[1:11:27] that you come up when he stretched you
[1:11:30] this far then come up you said well
[1:11:35] would he know it yes he knowed it he
[1:11:37] knows you wouldn't do it in the
[1:11:39] beginning he know Judas wouldn't do it
[1:11:42] he knowed from the beginning he was a
[1:11:43] son of predition but them thing them
[1:11:47] thing has to be
[1:11:49] fulfilled see the word has to be
[1:11:53] fulfilled and little together topes and
[1:11:55] and shadows so when does your name go in
[1:11:57] the book of a
[1:12:00] Believer
[1:12:02] sanctification when you reach the stage
[1:12:04] of sanctification in your
[1:12:07] journey your name is
[1:12:09] written in the Book of
[1:12:12] Life
[1:12:14] not the Eternal
[1:12:18] section those these two sections of one
[1:12:21] book if you can't see the Bible that way
[1:12:24] I don't understand it
[1:12:26] because the Bible tells a natural story
[1:12:29] of exactly where we are now that's
[1:12:34] right right exactly where we are now in
[1:12:37] the seventh Church Age The Bad and The
[1:12:40] Good is written about us right right
[1:12:43] mhm that put your name brother said it's
[1:12:46] not Arman
[1:12:48] Neville he said it's what's going on on
[1:12:51] Arman Neville is on Earth that that puts
[1:12:54] his name in the book so don't look for
[1:12:57] dick Addison you won't find it that's
[1:13:01] right and just because m is Samuel that
[1:13:04] ain't too good either because Dale wind
[1:13:07] up on the end of it and that's what
[1:13:08] messed us
[1:13:09] up but you see we were born
[1:13:13] Sinners MH amen that's right lost right
[1:13:22] y we become a part of a religious or
[1:13:25] order by coming to a Sanctified state in
[1:13:30] life centered around as we read there a
[1:13:33] moment ago the worship of
[1:13:34] God do you know what those old Pharisees
[1:13:37] names was written in the
[1:13:40] book judas's name was written in the
[1:13:46] book you're part of a religious order
[1:13:48] your name's written in the book that's
[1:13:50] the danger
[1:13:53] part cuz can be removed right
[1:13:57] right if you reach only sanctification
[1:14:00] in your
[1:14:04] journey you never heard brother R say
[1:14:06] you be saved today and lost
[1:14:09] tomorrow he says according to your
[1:14:12] confession well I thought eternal life
[1:14:15] he ain't talking about eternal
[1:14:18] life you can't have eternal life today
[1:14:21] and lose
[1:14:23] it that's why I'm born Christian cannot
[1:14:27] blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:14:31] right you said well look what I done
[1:14:33] that's all right you need to repent of
[1:14:36] it and get rid of it right but you can't
[1:14:39] blashe the Holy Ghost if you got the new
[1:14:41] birth
[1:14:43] right see God knew that Paul was coming
[1:14:46] to that new
[1:14:49] birth and Paul said even causing others
[1:14:52] to
[1:14:52] blaspheme that's right
[1:14:56] did but he said God forgave me because I
[1:14:59] done it in in
[1:15:05] ignorance but are you
[1:15:08] listening part of a religious
[1:15:12] order going to church and being
[1:15:18] religious makes people
[1:15:21] responsible to become a part of a point
[1:15:25] to where you become to
[1:15:28] sanctification that's the most dangerous
[1:15:30] stage of your
[1:15:32] journey because you
[1:15:35] think that you're all
[1:15:38] right you get new desires new thoughts
[1:15:40] new ideas you want to go to church you
[1:15:42] want to
[1:15:46] worship because you're part of a
[1:15:48] religious
[1:15:50] order but if you don't go on to the
[1:15:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:57] if you're foolish virgin your name will
[1:16:03] remain but if
[1:16:07] not it will be taken
[1:16:11] off now remember I said there were four
[1:16:13] classes your Prophet gave in that church
[1:16:16] age book the number four was those whose
[1:16:18] names were never written
[1:16:23] nowhere that's not a hot and toau in
[1:16:25] Africa that's never heard the
[1:16:30] truth that's people sometimes that go to
[1:16:33] church but don't go far enough or some
[1:16:35] that won't go to church at
[1:16:38] all but it won't become to a part of a
[1:16:40] religious order of
[1:16:45] sanctification they just go to
[1:16:47] church they're name in the
[1:16:50] book and then the preacher when they
[1:16:52] when they die what does the preacher say
[1:16:56] we know old brother so and so he had
[1:16:59] some problems but we all got
[1:17:02] problems all of us got
[1:17:04] problems the brother just had a little
[1:17:07] more problems than we got problems but
[1:17:09] we all got
[1:17:10] problems you've been to them hav
[1:17:14] you but I know his name was written in
[1:17:18] the book of
[1:17:20] life but he wrote it down on our records
[1:17:24] when he got
[1:17:27] saved the old Independent
[1:17:30] Baptist laid heavy on
[1:17:34] that when your name was written in that
[1:17:36] little car that you had about that long
[1:17:39] about like
[1:17:40] that your name was written in
[1:17:45] heaven the other Baptist believed pretty
[1:17:48] close
[1:17:49] because if you went to another church
[1:17:52] you had to call for your little card
[1:17:54] right
[1:17:57] and on that little card it would tell
[1:17:59] whether you was a member in good
[1:18:01] standing or
[1:18:04] not I read one time back years ago cuz I
[1:18:07] used to read as much as I could about
[1:18:08] some of those matters and and this fell
[1:18:12] is about 20 times that he joined the
[1:18:14] church well I guess he had 20
[1:18:18] cards or either he had one card with 20
[1:18:21] writings on
[1:18:27] cuz they actually believe people do that
[1:18:29] when your name is written in that church
[1:18:31] role God wrote it in
[1:18:34] heaven well that sounds like what you're
[1:18:36] talking about
[1:18:38] no when you become part of a religious
[1:18:41] order not join a
[1:18:45] church you see the four classes is
[1:18:49] ring there are people that names are
[1:18:52] written there they'll always be there go
[1:18:54] to in Eternal section and they will come
[1:18:56] to
[1:18:58] it there are people that their names was
[1:19:01] written
[1:19:02] there that will never come to the
[1:19:04] baptism of the Holy
[1:19:07] Ghost and they'll give their life for
[1:19:09] what they
[1:19:11] believe and will be given eternal life
[1:19:13] into white Throne there are people like
[1:19:16] Judas whose name was written there that
[1:19:18] had it
[1:19:22] removed that's what made him the son of
[1:19:24] predition
[1:19:27] but then there's a group of people his
[1:19:29] name's not written
[1:19:32] nowhere what part are we
[1:19:35] of what do you mean brother de I believe
[1:19:38] everything Prophet
[1:19:41] said oh my my computer does
[1:19:51] too it don't get upset when I Ty in
[1:19:54] something
[1:19:55] it just pulls it
[1:19:56] out tells me where it's
[1:19:59] at what about
[1:20:02] it two
[1:20:07] books I finally found it Church age book
[1:20:10] you're supposed to read from PR page
[1:20:12] 265 to
[1:20:16] 286 that's pretty
[1:20:20] close but now think about it for a
[1:20:22] moment I'll leave the other off cuz I
[1:20:25] know I can't get
[1:20:26] it I'll go ahead and take
[1:20:29] Wednesday preach on
[1:20:32] it sister Julie back a year or so ago
[1:20:36] asked me to preach on this I had got to
[1:20:38] it yet so I guess I can do it now that
[1:20:41] Dan and ephraim's names are
[1:20:45] removed you yet their names put back
[1:20:49] in and how that can take place so we
[1:20:51] wait a Wednesday so we'll just stop on
[1:20:54] that point
[1:20:59] Point your name goes on to look as a
[1:21:03] Believer when you start going to church
[1:21:06] and start trying to do
[1:21:10] right and you know what that makes you
[1:21:14] responsible you remember how we do when
[1:21:17] we dedicate a
[1:21:22] baby we say everybody in the
[1:21:25] building is dedicating themselves to
[1:21:28] live before this child right
[1:21:32] right if you don't live before that
[1:21:34] child a correct life you're a problem
[1:21:38] right if we're to live before those
[1:21:40] children and believe
[1:21:43] it see then becoming part of a religious
[1:21:47] order and this Bible comes into view
[1:21:50] that's
[1:21:52] right and it has the names not written
[1:21:56] out it has the
[1:21:58] names of every
[1:22:01] believer because it has what's going on
[1:22:04] in the
[1:22:05] age that we're
[1:22:08] living written in this
[1:22:10] book it tells you how good we are it
[1:22:13] tells how bad we are when you get to the
[1:22:16] church ages I'd invite you to read those
[1:22:18] Church
[1:22:20] ages it tells of two Vines
[1:22:23] there True Vine the false
[1:22:27] Vine then it gets on so Clos to you
[1:22:29] can't tell the difference the true and
[1:22:31] the false
[1:22:34] right see church this thing is not to
[1:22:37] just live good and one of these days
[1:22:39] maybe we'll get to
[1:22:44] heaven it's not that
[1:22:48] way it's being not a part of a religious
[1:22:52] order to where we go to church
[1:22:57] you remember when you first
[1:23:00] started maybe you thought you were
[1:23:04] saved maybe it was that's not to
[1:23:07] me but you started the church and you
[1:23:10] begin to want to do
[1:23:14] better you wanted to quit the things you
[1:23:16] were
[1:23:18] doing and get clean because you were a
[1:23:21] Christian and Christians don't not act
[1:23:24] like that
[1:23:26] yeah well see that's a part of the
[1:23:28] religious order of
[1:23:34] mankind you know the devil is very very
[1:23:40] religious he's not out there in The
[1:23:42] Honky TS
[1:23:43] today you know where he's at sitting
[1:23:46] right
[1:23:49] here they always say in a lot of
[1:23:51] churches they say well the reason we
[1:23:53] don't have very many people in our
[1:23:54] church church because we leave places
[1:23:56] for the angels to
[1:24:00] sit that might be justified not having a
[1:24:03] whole lot of people but because if the
[1:24:06] building here would be packed out and
[1:24:07] we've seen it a few
[1:24:09] times but you know the angels of God are
[1:24:12] still here that's right but you know the
[1:24:15] devil's still here
[1:24:17] too see he's interested in finding
[1:24:22] out you see a man get on the field and
[1:24:25] he starts
[1:24:26] running people in this message you
[1:24:28] remember it in your
[1:24:30] mind especially young they they just
[1:24:33] really get on fire and boy they come
[1:24:35] into the message and they've been in it
[1:24:37] about 3
[1:24:38] months and boy they straightening out
[1:24:42] everybody they know all about
[1:24:45] it they just straightening everybody
[1:24:49] out and people just start flocking to
[1:24:52] it that's a religious
[1:24:58] order they run with that person for a
[1:25:03] while and after a while they find them
[1:25:05] another person to run with for a
[1:25:08] while thinking each one of them is going
[1:25:11] to be the one that's going to take them
[1:25:12] to
[1:25:13] Heaven bring the P the Rapture
[1:25:20] Etc so they're running to and fro
[1:25:32] let see why can't we just settle
[1:25:35] down and say one thing that Peter said
[1:25:38] that brother ROM paraphrased it Peter
[1:25:43] said this is
[1:25:47] that you remember this is that that was
[1:25:50] spoken of in the word the holy up
[1:25:53] brother Brown said if this ain't that
[1:25:55] let's keep this till that gets here
[1:25:57] that's
[1:25:59] right good right I run about the country
[1:26:02] seeking after new
[1:26:07] things why not just settle
[1:26:11] down and just go day by
[1:26:14] day and then let the word just cleanse
[1:26:17] us out and
[1:26:20] Purge set us aside
[1:26:28] we happen to be here as chosen I guess
[1:26:30] to be the one that people's come to
[1:26:34] because we've had very little going
[1:26:39] out but people come here to want to
[1:26:42] hear
[1:26:43] well that's good because that shows that
[1:26:47] there's something within
[1:26:51] you but it's like I told Richard and
[1:26:53] mentioned it to do you I told him I said
[1:26:55] I don't want you in Lula
[1:26:57] because that you're just my
[1:27:02] son-in-law I said I want you Lula
[1:27:04] because of the word that you hear and
[1:27:07] want to be a part
[1:27:10] of you see when you come that way we
[1:27:13] don't have no problem
[1:27:14] right if you be like the brother said I
[1:27:17] came from place and came to Lula to
[1:27:19] follow the Lula
[1:27:22] thing that's what he told me
[1:27:25] I said that's where you messed up cuz
[1:27:27] there ain't no
[1:27:31] lul so you come out here looking for
[1:27:33] something they ain't no Lula thing we
[1:27:36] just part of the body of Christ amen
[1:27:40] well it proved out that he was looking
[1:27:42] for some other thing cuz he left went
[1:27:44] other places right so he must have found
[1:27:47] some words else that had a thing you
[1:27:52] know well
[1:27:55] but listen Church all names are revealed
[1:27:59] on the six
[1:28:03] seal there's not a name revealed on the
[1:28:08] Sabbath and the reason it's put on the
[1:28:10] six is because it is the ending of
[1:28:16] redemption so it have to be under the
[1:28:18] six that everything would be
[1:28:22] revealed that our names would be
[1:28:24] revealed
[1:28:27] there and Israel would be revealed
[1:28:31] there the 144,000 would be revealed
[1:28:34] there the foolish virgins would be
[1:28:36] revealed
[1:28:38] there and their Redemptive
[1:28:43] plan remember if you're people talking
[1:28:45] about salvation you got to have a place
[1:28:47] to go
[1:28:50] to or your salvation has no value
[1:28:58] see
[1:28:59] Church all
[1:29:04] names are not written in this Bible like
[1:29:07] writing out the
[1:29:09] name with all
[1:29:13] names they would ever be saved or
[1:29:16] lost they're written in this
[1:29:19] book even the prophet said even that
[1:29:22] fourth class that their name is written
[1:29:24] he said no doubt there is a record
[1:29:27] made
[1:29:30] somewhere I going to ask you to read
[1:29:32] what I'm give you in the church age book
[1:29:35] CU then you're going to see that we're
[1:29:36] going to come to
[1:29:41] that we're going to come through that
[1:29:43] and read it Wednesday in a lot of
[1:29:50] ways you said well my name is written in
[1:29:54] in the blood of Jesus
[1:29:55] Christ it's
[1:29:58] true our names were written in the book
[1:30:01] of
[1:30:02] life but then when you get to a little
[1:30:05] message called The Invisible Union of
[1:30:07] the Bride of Jesus
[1:30:11] Christ your Prophet said your name is
[1:30:22] transferred come on read the book
[1:30:24] book your name is
[1:30:28] transferred what from a religious
[1:30:31] order from a sanctified
[1:30:35] people to a born again believer amen
[1:30:39] that's right to find out your name was
[1:30:40] written in the lamb book of life before
[1:30:42] the foundation of the
[1:30:45] world not to shout Glory Hallelujah how
[1:30:48] Eternal we
[1:30:50] are but how did we get redeemed
[1:30:55] now I just end it with one
[1:30:57] point if you say we need to be
[1:31:02] redeemed
[1:31:05] okay then you're
[1:31:07] admitting at one time you was
[1:31:10] lost right right right right why would
[1:31:15] you say you've been redeemed so let's
[1:31:17] don't saying I'm redeemed anymore if we
[1:31:20] always was eternal
[1:31:27] if we don't need salvation then let's
[1:31:29] don't talk about it but must be what's
[1:31:32] happened to the people the message cuz
[1:31:34] they certainly cutting off the
[1:31:41] message something
[1:31:45] tantalizing to the
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:50] ear something to make you feel good
[1:31:55] oh can't you just remember when it
[1:31:57] Napoleon that put his hand in and walk
[1:31:59] like that or something can't you just
[1:32:02] remember you was back
[1:32:07] there well brother around saw me
[1:32:14] there
[1:32:18] yeah he said I've been in both
[1:32:21] places right
[1:32:25] right that's right so he's been beyond
[1:32:27] the curtain of time and he's been to
[1:32:29] Hell which one was you there that's
[1:32:33] right well now you just turn me
[1:32:36] down turn you
[1:32:39] down trying to get you to look at
[1:32:45] yourself and find out whether your name
[1:32:47] was written there or not my Bible says
[1:32:50] examine yourself to see whether you're
[1:32:52] in the faith or not that's right it
[1:32:54] don't say examine everybody
[1:32:57] else that's what we want to do
[1:33:00] right it say to examine
[1:33:05] yourself because all names are are
[1:33:09] revealed on the six
[1:33:13] seal There's No Redemption P
[1:33:17] there just as we were talking this
[1:33:19] morning and about it where the Prophet
[1:33:22] said the six seal is the end of the
[1:33:26] world he's not talking about it being
[1:33:29] the end of
[1:33:31] the or annihilating a
[1:33:35] world he's talking about the world order
[1:33:38] that we exist
[1:33:42] under Armageddon will take care of this
[1:33:47] situation
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:50] right think on these things home brother
[1:33:55] well then all names will have to be
[1:33:57] revealed where was your name revealed
