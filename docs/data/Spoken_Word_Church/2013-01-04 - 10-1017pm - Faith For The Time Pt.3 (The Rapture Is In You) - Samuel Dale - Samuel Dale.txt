jesus name amen he would there is a um brother that made a uh thing of his or her brother tim humes the last time they made it but you can go on your internet and pull up gary walker and it is a good i believe all around uh testimony and it's not just a testimony of this that or the other it is a good preaching service i thought he done a real good job of explaining explaining a lot of things and if you'd like to to listen to it you know or to see it go on to there and you can download it and see it and i would encourage you because i think it was good amen just remember sister mary uh brother dougherty was back there a minute ago and i see she's gone back to the restroom so remember her that the lord would would uh touch her because she was sick there for a little bit okay hebrews 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ that is going to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god and of the doctrine of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment this will we do if god permit all right now let's go back to let's go to second corinthians 12 and we'll just read the first four verses it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord i knew a man in the spirit above 14 years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such in one caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word pull off my whole rig i hope you you know caught what i've talked about this morning understood and to be able to follow with me as to that's all right it'll stay in my pocket but uh you know we're talking about dead works now paul mentions that i said there in in hebrews 6 and he also brings it out in hebrews 9. and in no way in the world is he calling the word of god dead works all right now that's i hope that's settled at least for you to know that i don't believe he is i believe he's bringing it out the way that the prophet of god brought the message unto us to show us that we constantly need to go on and not to stop you know because if we do then we will dry up and die and we must continue on and if we are not the group i believe we are but if we are not the group that will be there at the change of the body then we will be going on as much as we can and someone else will have to take over and go on because it is not a dead thing of setting steel this is a continual moving of the spirit of god the prophet of god said that the pillar of fire behind the veil said it was constantly moving you know because he said it's a lights and actions and things that it was constantly moving god does not stop he keeps on going so i hope you can follow what i'm was trying to say that dead works is not just life and things like that we look at it that way that's automatically we know that's dead works but the very word that we receive can become dead unto us if we don't take that and step out onto the next step and keep moving on now if you didn't hear the morning message i pray that you will you know hear that and continue on to see what we're talking about because paul was calling the beginnings or principles as dead works and brother random called it dead works but now he wasn't calling it something dead like we call it but it's just the fact that if we stop any work in our christian journey then we've got a problem you know we've got a problem so just let's continue on let's examine ourselves as the scripture says and see if we're in the faith in the faith of this hour you say well we're in the message the message can become dead works for you and i if we don't continue on and make that message manifest in you and i in the new birth i believe that now and that's my goal that's what i'm talking about all right now we read then too that you know when spoke just a little that paul said there in verse three i think it is in the scriptures in uh hebrews that we would continue on if god permits well he didn't permit paul to continue right you know all the way right right all right but one time he did permit paul to be caught up right and to see the things you know that would be in glory and even things that he said he was not even able to speak about now brother random was caught up and uh he went to as he said himself he said paul went to the third heaven he said i believe i went to the first heaven and caught up you know and saw things and come back and done it remember uh moses was taken up and shown how to make the uh the in the mount and shown how to make the the tent the the things that he had to make all of the utensils and everything he was shown how to make those things and uh you know that would be uh something of caught up because we're going to talk about how that the rapture i told you i would when i get on over i mentioned it part of the way but i want to talk about it today and this is the faith faith for the time number three but you can put you another title to it that the rapture is in you all right now we want to speak about that for a little while and and see but i want to ask you a question to begin with while everybody is attentive to at least the point not asleep you know or trying to figure out how to get home in a hurry or whatever i want to ask you a question are you in the rapture people i've heard this ever since uh back in the beginning when we came into the message and people would say we're in the rapture well now are we in the rapture or is the rapture in us now uh to be in the rapture would mean that you know and i didn't agree with their approach back then as to what i understood some to be saying that uh it's kind of like we're in the millennium you know and uh things like that and i didn't agree with that and i asked that question there are we in the rapture or is the rapture in us right you know because i want to i want to definitely as believers i i know we all want to be in the rapture and and the word rapture is not even in the bible it is a word added to uh you know in this day to understand and the prophet said in paragraph 128 of the rapture message that the word rapture is not in the bible it's the word is caught up you know caught up to meet the lord in the air and things like that all right that's why i read what paul said in corinthians that he was caught up right all right now showing then my point is that i believe that the rapture was in paul that's what caught him up right you know the word rapture as we call it uh you know would would mean caught up now brother random used the word rapture uh 606 times in the message so i'm sure he knew a lot about the rapture you know because that was the point but now listen here's what i want to do now stop right there because i believe that the rapture is in you all right just like i preached and tried to show you that the second coming of the lord jesus christ started on the day of pentecost with the baptism of the holy ghost but there's plenty of things yet to be complete about his second coming that will transpire in this day or another day or whatever and you know just to say that the new birth is the second coming don't label me just so small because i'm not talking that way i'm talking about that when they started the when the new birth fell on the day of pentecost that that started the second coming of the lord jesus christ it will finish in the end time by the lord coming here to take us there so there's a lot to be said about it it's not just well or the second coming is a new birth i didn't teach it that away now so all right now and neither will it be to say that the day you got born again you was in the rapture no i believe the day you got born again the rapture was in you okay and i believe we'll try to prove that point to be able to to see because you know then we can i can understand all right but paul now he didn't go on because god didn't permit it he didn't go on to the perfection he was talking about he said let us go on to perfection you know he didn't attain unto the finish of it because he had he would walk off the earth in the rapture you know change and then you and i would have a lot of problems so you know i'm glad he didn't but uh i'll tell him when i see him and i thank him for that much but that was the way god had it for ordained anyway all right now even though paul you would admit that paul was standing at the faith of the fathers until even the uh peter would say that paul said things hard to be understood all right but yet paul never reached the change of the body he could be called up to see the third heaven and talk about it and come back and explain certain things he could be caught up and see many great things he was caught up in revelation and preached the word of god unto us but yet he never reached the position to where that the rapture could transpire all right now that's sensible that's not degrading that's sensible see it was not permitted because god had to wait until the end time until the entire opening of the word of god to be able to you know bring somebody to the position to make that change all right then see we know paul didn't preach the seals you know he didn't preach the son of man he didn't preach those things and not being doing it then it was waiting until the end time because all of the word was not given unto him but he had faith for the time and so did each born-again believer right now in doing that then i believe paul made manifest i don't believe he just talked about it he made manifest the things for his day now he spoke of things to come that he could not make manifest because he could not make the change in the thing but yet still he did for his time see those disciples we talk about it that they had the virtues they had the faith of the fathers but they did not have the headstone so that would mean in the end times something would have to come all right now i believe they were raptured up in the revelation or caught up in the revelation of the hour that they were living all right see that's what caught them up in ephesians two you'll find verse six he says we're resurrected sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus so the born-again believer by the new birth see would be part of the second coming of the lord jesus christ and will be a part in the rapture right by the new birth would secure your place now i can just you know you can run in your computer new birth and rapture or or whatever and and some things and and i'll be glad to show you where the prophet spoke of many things about the uh the fact that that new birth we'll read a few brings you everything you have in the of all right now but to line it up saying keep it right verse in in ephesians 1 and 3 it says blessing us with all spiritual blessings we're resurrected we're caught up right the born-again believer is caught up out of the world into a spiritual condition by the baptism of the holy ghost then you work and it's taking us even according to ephesians 1 and 20 is taking us up to the right hand of god now you say well well brother i know we're still right here so let's don't make this the right hand of god you know but by the baptism of the holy ghost your soul is all that is caught up the body and spirit is still in this carnality realm you know and that's where our trouble is at to where that we we need some help but see the new birth then in the soul would start the born-again believer putting us into a condition that the rapture would be in us not to just say we're in the rapture a lot of difference in the two statements the rapture is in the born-again believer because where is it coming from well and brother then we've got to wait till the end time where the lord and suffering said i said that there's a lot to be made manifest all right now so then what are we uh what have we done we have been caught up raptured up out of the sinful condition of the existence of the world into heavenly places which is the position of the believer in christ now that's why the prophet would say when they asked him a question then he said it'll just be a change it'll just be a change the simple thing of the translation the things can just be a change why because it's got to be in you and me if any if it's in you and me then it'll come out to the right place now listen to what your prophet had to say this is on christ the mr god revealed that he's been slowly unfolding the mystery now i didn't give you this so that was that this morning's not your seat give me some water i probably need it strung out this morning maybe we can hark it out this evening okay he said down through the ages he'd been slowly unfolding the mystery what christ is the mystery god revealed not jesus being the mystery christ all right now i believe that he was trying to show us too who we are and what had been taking place so this is what he says now to be sure that the whole rapture now luther was apart now he said well luther will be apart see see that's what your thinking is right luther will be apart you know what's your lifter's gonna come up well how's he gonna come up i see your mind i know what it is cause mine what students see your mind was locked to where luther will be in the rat shirt one day but that went away said it to be sure that the whole rapture now looked there was a part wesley was apart the prophets was apart thank you if there aren't a part you know watch what he's saying just in the revelation that they was making that they was making up the body the revelation making up the body feet toes arms and so forth until the head which we'll get to in a few minutes see that makes the entire rapture it's the body of the word which is crotch now as i said unlock your mind because your mind is thinking well sure we know we know one of these days luther's gonna be in the rapture but now that wasn't what he said he said look there was a part right okay all right so now let's get that correct in the rapture message paragraph 115 365 1204 the life that comes up through luther was what made wesley the life that come out of wesley is what made pentecost the life that comes out of pentecost makes the wheat listen but they are a carrier and they remember masterpiece where the prophet brought in the message masterpiece luther wesley pentecost and said they were not the seed not meaning they were not part of the body of christ but what was he saying he said we've got to give birth to the seed we've got to be the seed in other words all right so now watch the life that come up to luther was what made wesley enough to come out of wesley is what made pentecost the life that comes out of pentecost makes a week but they are a carrier see the real life goes through there the message goes through but it's heading up into the wheat that's the reason that we come out and brings the whole thing in the rapture up here at the top the bride itself comes out of each age but the denominational stalk dies dries up and dies all right now luther and wesley and pentecost is going to be part of the rapture because the rapture was in them if you said they were in the rapture then you would put the rapture back there that's why i didn't agree with that and i don't even now agree with their statement that way i'd rather say the rapture is in you because when they receive that new birth then in that new birth is everything you have need of you remember that statement we'll read it in a minute everything we have need of is in that listen to what he says on abraham in his seed 1961 416. do you believe the church started at pentecost do you believe that first round are of jews and so forth then do you believe that the first reformation of the so-called church for the rapture was luther's group now was he degrading down there what is he saying was he degrading the first three church or some four church ages and then jumps up to the fifth or something like that no questions and answers in 1954 103 evening now i think luther west and all of them many of them will go in the rapture they had the portion of the spirit that was preached to them and they believed it now so the rapture is in you just like the second coming of jesus christ is in you by the new birth now the prophet said everything you have need of is in you when you receive that holy ghost now what did he say you needed to do he said you needed to do just like a tree said all the apples that ever be on the tree was in the tree then the seed when it's planted he said but what it needs to do is just keep drinking and drinking and pushing out i forgot how many gallons of water a day that just one small tree actually drinks it's up into 50 or something gallons a day that it actually consumes for that tree to be able to operate so let's just read what he said calling of abraham 1955 11 16 and i told you the other night you got to have faith but you got to know how to use that faith to make yourself well to get happiness out of life if you're born again everything you got in need of is right in you when you're born again because the holy spirit comes to heart and that's all you have need of it's the holy spirit it produces the rest now see then people would say well yeah i've got the new birth so i got everything all right now you're you're close to the truth but that's not all the truth because there's many feelings of the holy spirit there's a growth development in the holy spirit or the statue of a perfect man there are many things that goes with the new birth and that is part of the new birth but see that way then what i'm talking about the rapture is in us now that that will change us is in us it probably says your resurrection is in you i read one this morning i'm pretty sure it was in there he said your healing is in your new birth right so yeah but other people can be healed that's right because that's faith but we don't have to weigh up on those things we can believe because of the healer being inside of us all of that series on jehovah jireh georethanol was a background for this message this afternoon so now you let it pass over you and that's your problem just listen and let's see what it says i believe the day you were born again that you got the baptism of the holy ghost right now the prophet said now you explain this one to me the prophet said that the holy ghost was in you waiting on you to bring him the word you agree that statement well i thought the holy ghost was the word see that we're not thinking correctly i mean we're not thinking about the holy ghost can be in there in the new birth at faith and yet let's not have all of those virtues and that's why a big portion of the people of the message preached it you got to come all the way up to here before you get the new birth up to where it says holy spirit on the pyramid right under the basis of love but that's not correct because the prophet said you're born again at faith and then you add virtue see peter and him said all right now don't have time to go preach all of that but you ought to know it all right but see in that new birth you explain this one ever born born-again believer has the person of jesus christ living in you you agree with that statement amen is what your prophet said that's right how can every born-again believer say if there's only ten how can god be in every one of them because you're talking about god you're not talking about well he he just he's just a spirit you know he just no he's a person well how can that person be inside of you he's a little bitty person running around in that inch square compartment that everybody thinks would be the soul and a little fella running around in their head not quite see it's what we try to comprehend about things without really just relaxing and saying thank you lord i've got the person of jesus christ believing in me i don't understand it but i believe it amen all right but you see then the rapture is one what a probably called a rapture in the mexican wreck he said the rapture is revelation he said and the bride would be waiting for the revelation of the rapture but if you don't have the rapture inside of you how is it going to transpire right right i mean that's simple questions i just want to know if the rapture is not inside of you then we're gonna have to get it from somewhere you know right but if it's inside of you then it can keep pushing out until it brings out into manifestation what is inside of us that's all i want if we just keep adding that word and he keeps adding what we have to do because the rapture is a revelation now revelation is faith and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so it's a good position but if you're looking at the rapture out there i'm just honest now how do we get out there is the rapture up in the air 20 feet away is it over here is it over there is it in jeffersonville is it in tucson arizona because that's what everybody thought is that the way we think well one of these days one of these days something's gonna happen some brother's gonna pick it up and he don't preach it that's why you see these young guys come along and they you know man they know how to straighten everything out when they first come in you know you know a little pentecostal babies and they know how to preach and how to straighten everybody out and then they while they know all about the message and they knew all about the prophet what he said and they can give you quotes because they got the computer but do they know about the god of the word well brother dale aren't you looking for a time to come yeah because the word rapture means caught away caught up but we're not caught up in the baptism of the holy ghost by the new birth right there's no way to be caught up dark right because your prophet said only with the holy ghost would put you in the new birth put you in any phase to talk about a rapture he said for the rapture it's for the royal sea to abraham only right only for the royal seat of abraham it's not for everybody i'm sorry but it's not it's not for those who have not had a new birth but if luther had a part of the rapture wesley apart and the word they were making up of the age then would it not be that the new birth within them would be the rapture in them well i never thought of it like that okay see that way i'm trying to get our mind off of trying to look up to something and to get up here you know a place there is a place purity is in christ therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on the rapture within those people but let us go on amen the rapture is an ever born again believer but let us go on amen let us go on to that time of the rapture when i mean that i mean change let us go on to the time of being caught up the change cause even the dead has to come up we're all here together for a little while and then we're caught up to meet the lord in the air right so there's a lot about the rapture as i said about the second coming there's a lot about the rapture that will transpire and i do not believe that the second coming of jesus christ could have taken place without this prophet coming to branson message because i believe that is the second coming my new birth then would match up and agree with everything that would ever be said down to time of the truth now not the wrong things i truly believe in luther's message of the just shall live by faith i truly believe in sanctification i believe in the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts the things i believe in all of it why because my new birth will compare with all of that and that's the only way i know it's right it's in my new birth how do i how many times have i told you this how do i check doctrines get these out get them out just like that and don't turn them over now i know you will just leave it like that you don't have to fold it because see i wanted you to make up your mind as to about what i've been saying and then we're going to read what brother ryan said see and if you made up your mind brother dale don't know what in the world he's talking about all the rapture's out younger and one day we'll run fast enough and we'll jump up there and we'll we'll we'll make it or somebody's gonna come along they can't preach this though you know some of these brothers that's what i said you see somebody young come along they start off and all at once you see people just flock into it just go into it and just following it and then after a while you see them backing away because they come to realize that you look something wrong you know but they uh you know they go far after for a while and there's never been a doctrine that has come out that i've known of that i didn't try to thoroughly study those things because i believe that you know like brother said all doctrines are based upon truth now i want to know what the person said i've defended people when people would say i've defended publicly and don't mind saying it i don't agree with the two lords i don't but i defended the brother that preached it this way i said you don't understand what he's trying to say he's too intelligent to be saying that there's two like two like used to be twos you know he's trying to say something but then i heard him myself say that jesus was a another person yeah okay i heard it you know you said i never said that well the type did i don't know how i got a hold of them but i didn't hear it but you see that didn't agree with my holy spirit now that's why i believe see that everybody down through there i believe the rapture has been a process that started on the death pentecost and it began to unfold itself down through time and bringing it out to the place until here in the end time someone is going to see the change and i'm praying hoping you and i are part of it if not we're going to change don't worry about it we just go by the grave sister clevis used to always kidding with us about it and she'd say if i go to the grave before you said i'll get to beat you up and that's true because that's what the bible says the lord himself shall you know i mean the dead cross your eyes first all right now what you see i believe the rapture is in us when you receive that new birth but what you need to do is you keep me to putting word into that soul faith comes by what hear it so the holy ghost is waiting on you and i to bring him the word and your prophet said he'll quicken it just as quick as you bring it now i'm honest how about you i've read a lot of things but you know what i'm glad god didn't reveal as the truth and you because we're reading with our old former glasses you know we're reading it like bad just matthew this presbyterian brand of monster whatever but you know god can't quicken error how can he do it he can't make error live but he can make his work live show everything you have need of lies within that new birth but if we don't keep drinking in and pushing out drinking in and pushing out are going on it will become dead words you say does that mean that we're lost and going to help no you wouldn't listen to this morning it doesn't mean that you're lost true christians down through time have looked at things and it become dead works and because they did not go home it really did become dead works they tied together the two messages now let's read this it's from the message show it's the father 1953 907 a service what you have to do with the tree you take the tree and you plant it in the ground then you have to water it and as you water it it doesn't do nothing but drink drink drink it has to drink more than its portion and more it drinks the bigger it swells up it pushes out limbs then it pushes out leaves then it pushes out blossoms then it pushes that output to that right and that's where christian is we are planted together in christ jesus who is the inexhaustible fountain of life we're planted in christ and we just drink and drink and drink and push out and everything we have need of for the earthly journey this divine healing the power of god and all these other things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the holy ghost for you're planted in christ hallelujah the holy ghost baptism yes sir and everything you have need of for this life's journey even the rapture is right in you then okay don't resent that now you won't tell you to know i'm reading what brother brown said he said the rapture's in you and he said these things he said don't resent that that's the truth the rapture is in us now i will prove it by the gospel now look where he goes those who he called he justified and those who he justified he hath glorified hallelujah then in heaven today we're a glorified in the presence of god right now i'm just pushing out to it see glory god's in his word you believe it all right just push it out the rapture is in you now so in 1953 was not 1965 when the prophet preached it so a lot of people's idea of the rapture is that the rapture was just nothing until brother branham came we could read the bible right and we talked about a rapture right no of course we didn't know what it was no but we knew something about it and the rapture is only for the royal seat of abraham it's only father born again believer the rest will have to come up at another time and be judged and things to receive life but the rapture comes first i'm looking down on the other notes see not how i were to show it 1965 that's why the rapture is different and only and will only be for the royal seed of abraham it cannot come by natural carnal seed of the church it'll have to be the royal seed of abraham the royal seeds of the word of god true abraham the royal seed that's why the rapture has to be first and he gives you the trumpet divorce and has to be first because the rapture is in you now his second coming is in you now so it's not to say that we're in the rapture it's to say the rapture is in us all right now the minute you receive the new birth that automatically means one thing you're going in the rapture right no matter how small or whatever point no matter who it was down to the ages luther wesley whatever we use those because a lot of people differ about lutheran wesley you know as being people say oh they didn't have nothing they had the new birth of the age and that new birth of the age put them in the kingdom of god and made them a place that they would come up in a resurrection and walk off the earth just like you and i will the only difference between the two is god never permitted them to do that but one day here he's going to permit someone to see what the rapture really is amen and it's inside of you right it's not a place or a you know a jeffersonville or a tucson or you know they kept on with brother branham and what did he finally say they want to know about a place what'd he say he said i just got it there is a place that you must be all right boy everybody had their pen make sure i spell this right honey you know let's get the right address i i know what they've done years ago some of them wrote the questions and others wrote the answer because they didn't have no books back then right and some of them from athens that's what they've done through a brother called i mean brother sister colleen gin and some of those people one of them would write the question doesn't write the answer because they couldn't get all of it so you know okay now honey you write to the place and i'll write the address you know so we know exactly the street number no he said he's in jesus christ and he's the word amen amen it's in jesus christ the place is in jesus christ this is not us in christ it's christ in us we didn't come here with eternal life but we came here in jesus christ now jesus christ comes in us to give us eternal life ever born again believer who was it anyhow somebody told it that they wanted brother brown to go talk to their like their daddy or granddaddy or something and they wanted them to see where the old man was at you know you may have heard the story so brother random goes in sits down and talks with the old brother never says a word gets up and walks out you know not nothing to him about anything and come out put around him he said don't worry about him he'll be there said he's in another age see they wanted to get up into where they were at they said he's in another age he says he'll be there see brother i'll never try to explain the seals or thunders 70 wicks of daniel whatever to the man but by the gift that god had given him he knew the man was a born-again believer but he was of another age and there was no need of trying to help him because he doesn't like me that got too old i guess but you see what i'm talking about the rapture is in you now just keep pushing out just keep drinking in just keep on inhaling the message until we become the message i'm having so much trouble well all i got to say for you is one thing it's going to get worse okay grumbling gripe yourself on the way do what you don't do he said well you you you sure ain't that preacher but you can tell us about the good things i liked that brother walker and what he had to say he kind of made a graft on the picture you know and he said now right here is what you think you can stand you know i said this line right above here is where you're going see immediately come to me the bible says that god will not allow anything to be placed on you that you cannot right he'll give you grace for it so he made it a graph and he said this is what you think you can stand that's your height of level of pain that's as far as you can go but here's where it's going well he's done a great job and he made a little drawing and made a pretty good size a little drawing of a pyramid and see it goes up to that red line and back down you know he said now you ready you get up tired everything's great okay you stood it he said now here's what god does you just push that line on up higher and he give you your fighting level right above the red you know said now here's where you're going i don't understand it but he said even the medical doctors agreed because i wouldn't hurry i don't understand he said he was in so much pain until he said literally the morphine the highest level they could give him was nothing like enough to be able to even just take off the sharpness and because he was just beat up plant busted in his mouth he just all tore up and worried about him with brain damage that was the worst thing and they figured he'd never make it for nothing anyhow he said there was this thing came up out of him and stood beside of him and said it was a saying more is coming more is coming more is coming i forgot the words i'll use it the best that i remember but he called it and the medical doctors or the people called it the the pain booger you know was there beside of him for a long time he said one day it was nobody in the room but him said here come alive and said a person walked up the side of you arms folded this went over it look down at him and i forgot what the wordings sister truly brought remember more nanny that one but then when that man finished with his statement the pain left he was totally gone then his point was you think you can't stand it he said and as a unless you're a christian you can't see a christian can stand a whole lot more pain than a person that's not a christian because you realize the end of it i was listening and thinking about what the bible says about that you know that that word like a woman having a baby it's horrible death is very close to any woman's ever had a baby in the natural part anyway but yet you see them just in a little while and they're grinning holding the baby and the bible says that you is soon forgotten because a man child is born now if you were standing looking at the pain sisters and looking at the baby you know some way would you say it's not worth it huh joyce told danny get out of here and shut up cause he was telling her to push the push she said get out of here but look at how open jacob the point is the end of anything if you saw the end of it it does away with all of the middle oh that's where christians are to do we'll look at the end of all things we may be facing horrible situations of life losing basically all because brother brown said it become physically bereft to lose all that's what he said but the ultimate end of seeing jesus christ either the pain or agony's not even thought of you know i never really could understand one thing and i saw that uh rabbi richman on the videos of brother biscuit it really helped me to understand something because you know death is horrible painful agonizing but you know god looked down and he saw adam and eve and he saw them lost and he killed the animals and ripped the skin off of them right every sacrifice that was put forth don't you think god didn't know all of the millions of animals that's been been offered upon altars and things don't you think god knows the pain of each and every one of those and that brother made a statement it really helped me he said that god sees the end of what that would be and said thereby the animal would graciously lay down and give his life because he knows what the ultimate end is to cover all of that and how we would be lost without it plenty of stories of people giving their lives to try to save other people you know let's take another day about those 30-something miners that was 2 000 something feet underground they drilled a hole down and i knew they said they were going to have to pull them up through there and i wondered well how in the world are they going to get them up to there because pull it up and i mean i've been in whales and and the ropes don't work too good and you bite the sides and every rock is there are you going to scratch it and you know i've been down 90 feet on the ground working in wells that rope's going to be biting big big baby and naturally they could not do it exactly perfectly straight because there's no way could be done i saw the picture of it they had a little capsule and they put that capsule down through the ground right you know what that is and oxygen but how are you going to get that guy from the oxygen up to the oxygen you know well it's going to breathe in now i couldn't bring the shaft into it and oxygen and everything that the man in need the only thing he needed to do i forgot did anybody remember the exact inches was it 23 or 20 there had to be within a certain range a width to be able to get in that capsule so i would imagine if it been me i would have went on a diet to make sure i could fit in that little capsule but you know they got a mirror worn out but you know what they've done before they brought them out they would have excuse me they put a man in that same bag man got in the capsule in the city now you know that's what happened for you and me someone had to come in a capsule to be able to take our place all we got to do is make sure that we don't get overloaded with abandoned baggage of the world and too fat i used to kid brother mold i said it's going to take more rapture and faith for you than his me but back then he was about this tall and weighed more than i did you know you know i used to tell him i said you better lose some weight it's going to take more fights for you but you see every one of those people come out of there every member of the body of christ has been sealed in a capsule she has been preserved with oxygen and everything that we have needles amen they may be two or three thousand feet that we have to follow to get out but god made a way god made away from you and i that's right think about it the rapture is in you now amen by the new birth and that was a 53 statement that your prophet knew so when he was preaching in 65 was it something different no he was just telling us how right telling us how it could take place you know to get those men out of that ground somebody had to figure that thing out and they had to drill our holes down right you know first then they had to go and you know what me and you do i remember reading a story about a tunnel one time they was digging like this on each side to come together well they missed it within that tunnel back out you know because they missed it there's our dead works folks of thinking that we've got it right and we know what's going on let's just let god do it the rapture is in you now by the new birth all we got to do is just keep drinking in until the capsule is finished to carry us out of here because the rapture is a revelation of god's word right one step at a time amen come on really enjoyed the children come on jesus really enjoyed the children singing they're part of the service the rapture is in you now just keep drinking and pushing out until we make manifest what that profit has brought to us you know folks i told you this morning we're not backing up we're not backing up we're gonna approach some things to see what is perfection because we got to go under perfection if we don't have it we got to go on to it god's already making way because the message is here we're not looking for somewhere else or something to do it's in the message what we got to do is just keep digging it out until we get the tunnel correct and god supply the capsule he just brings us right out of it all impossibilities in years past for those men to have been brought out of there even a few years down the road an impossibility but they brought them all out impossible for a rapture to fully be made manifest and come to a conclusion until this end time and god had to send us a prophet to give us the word all we got to do is get pressurized is that the words he used he said we need to get pressurized because when you go up into space you know you got to have a whole lot you you that been up in the air as much as as you know what is it over ten thousand feet twelve or something then they gotta pressurize the cabin and without that then you go up and you pass out and die see it wasn't possible down through there because god didn't permit it but in the end time he sent a prophet to bring us the message and he is permitting it now all that we have need of is laying within the message so let's get into the message why is the people are scared of the message well we don't want to get into them deep things well i brought around preaching now he didn't have a bit of trouble coming out on a message called feast of the trumpets pretty sure and he said now i don't have to preach that he said because it was supernaturally revealed in the opening of the seals and he says that don't apply to the gen to the bride so i don't have to preach it now he would've had a bit of trouble come out there the day of the seals and said now we don't have to worry about this we just you know this is all over no that's what's going to pressurize you and me is the revealed word of the message of the hour i don't know of any other way to go to you if you do let's get changed in a hurry because we're running out you know let's stand 5 30 faith for the time we may have had it down through there but now is the time to put that faith into action get fit for the capsules to be ready to go clean here from salvation are you talking about a rapture me me related to the buildings and the properties and all let's just believe all of these worked out right let's believe that everything needs to be worked out you're the problem solver we just get in the way so you just come on the scene now and work out all the problems that are done and the march got there at work and the situation the buildings and the properties and everything amen we believe it anybody else ever is you sick got a lot of problems but let's just believe that everything will be all right father in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ we send this prayer cloth we grant our lord that you work out all the things in his life he just gets so weak and run down and can't work and things we don't care what science is about it we know who the healer is and we believe you and we commit it to you now in the name of jesus christ anybody else is make it all work out they can do things holy spirit we love you anybody else do you have nothing because you asked god i'm not because you asked none when i asked and see with holy spirit unto me brother boyd you know that's what he wants to be read here jonathan is now deployed in afghanistan and he has a an address there and he's smart downstairs and showing you where to send it and carts and letters and things and you know just let him know that you're thinking of him that you're praying for him you know all the things and praying everything will be all right uh if you wanted to send snacks or other things there are certain limitations in other words if you want to send him a gift of some kind there is a certain limitation you have to talk to sister ashley you know about those things and doing it but uh just think about him and pray for him and everything has to be exactly written correctly because they want you know how they are and also in the military so you know just remember that right and just pray that the lord would take care of it any other things before we go lord jesus we love you father we pray that you would open our understanding and to reveal to us lord that whatever we have need of is inside of us we don't have to pray it down lord said joshua was prayed through before the world joshua didn't even have the new birth inside of him to pray for him but we have the very god of the world the earth to all things all of those compound names of jehovah is dwelling inside of us by the new birth so all we have need of is to contact you in there i'm sure there's a human element out here that we have troubles but father you're the only one that can override it i don't understand how you could ever come down and save a human mortal when we're so rotten and wretched mess but you did and you made a way you make a way for this rapture change you'll make a way for the caught up god is already inside of us we love you father and we committed to you now in jesus name you dismiss never pray one for another i am oh oh wow thank you oh you
