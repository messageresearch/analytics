[0:00] cause he lives
[0:04] all my fear is gone
[0:10] because i
[0:14] know he holds my future
[0:21] and life is worth the living
[0:26] just
[0:27] because he lives
[0:33] amen
[0:34] great blessing
[0:36] to know that the savior lived amen
[0:40] you know it's
[0:41] that's the thing to know jesus christ
[0:43] you know who he is
[0:46] because the enemy
[0:48] is always
[0:49] trying to destroy you and take your mind
[0:51] off
[0:52] of jesus christ
[0:55] i think this this week he tried to
[0:57] bother me
[0:59] more in dreams than before
[1:03] i woke up one morning one night
[1:06] and i touched my face
[1:08] and feeling something grabbed my hand
[1:10] and slapped it away
[1:11] from my face
[1:13] i put it back again but you know
[1:16] you know that those things are satan
[1:19] trying to distract you and destroy you
[1:22] because the prophet tells us there's
[1:24] only
[1:25] two spirits
[1:26] and you know jesus christ
[1:28] wouldn't do anything else to you like
[1:30] that
[1:31] but he he's always with us in giving
[1:34] we're going to read this morning from
[1:38] psalm 86
[1:41] verses 1 through 17.
[1:48] let us let us pray
[1:51] heavenly father again as we gather
[1:53] together lord around your word
[1:56] lord we know that the things that we
[1:57] have when the goodness of your spirit is
[1:59] among us lord we know that you live we
[2:02] know that you've given unto us lord
[2:05] strength to fight against the enemy lord
[2:07] that you were coming to us and guide us
[2:10] lord we thank you for all things that
[2:11] you do but whoever we are lord let us
[2:14] put trust in you
[2:16] lord turn away from the wickedness of
[2:18] this world
[2:19] the same would destroy us if we could
[2:22] but lord jesus you promised that you
[2:25] would leave us that you would lead us
[2:26] and guide us that you would never leave
[2:28] us not for sacrifice yes and god that's
[2:31] what we are trusting in
[2:32] and we issued this morning father let us
[2:34] all be united
[2:36] as one into your spirit lord we may hear
[2:40] the words if they come forth or until we
[2:42] all be
[2:43] guided accordingly in jesus christ's
[2:46] name we pray
[2:48] amen
[2:55] from
[2:56] psalm
[2:57] 86
[3:00] bow down thy near o lord hear me for i
[3:03] am needy for i am poor and needed

[3:31] forgive and plenty is in mercy unto all
[3:34] them that call upon thee
[3:44] in the day of my trouble i will call
[3:47] upon thee for thou will answer me
[4:00] all nations
[4:02] whom thou has made
[4:04] shall come and worship
[4:06] before thee
[4:08] oh lord and shall glorify thy name

[4:22] i will walk in thy truth
[4:24] unite my heart to fear thy name i will
[4:28] praise you
[4:30] with all my heart
[4:32] and i will glorify thy name forevermore
[4:36] for greater than mercy towards me
[4:40] and thou has delivered my soul from the
[4:43] lord's hail
[4:56] but thou o lord are a god full of
[4:59] compassion
[5:01] and gracious longsuffering and plainiest
[5:03] in mercy and truth

[12:38] dear lord jesus thank you for this day
[12:40] you've given us
[12:41] thank you for the
[12:43] pride of jesus christ that's
[12:45] settled in lord and
[12:47] under this roof father to hear from you
[12:49] not to hear from a man not to
[12:51] not to hear a man's idea but to hear the
[12:53] word of the lord coming straight from
[12:55] the mind of god
[12:57] father we pray that you be with the ones
[12:58] that are sick there's some that's not
[12:59] here that seeks sister mary different
[13:01] ones lord we pray that you would bless
[13:03] them and be with them

[13:06] sick father lord the time is getting
[13:08] short
[13:09] we got to get out of here and we want to
[13:11] take them all with us so lord i pray
[13:12] that you'd quicken their heart lord
[13:14] prick them at their heart as it was on
[13:16] the day of pentecost and ask the
[13:18] question what shall we do
[13:20] to be saved
[13:22] repent
[13:23] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[13:24] christ
[13:25] that's what you do to receive the
[13:27] baptism of the holy ghost i know this we
[13:29] got to talk about what's going on
[13:30] between that
[13:31] but lord how simple is that believe on
[13:33] the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be
[13:34] saved you did not make it difficult
[13:37] it just comes from a decision
[13:39] that each one of us have to make well
[13:41] father i pray that we make the right
[13:43] decision this morning lord
[13:45] lord just be with the bride around the
[13:46] world be with the ones lord that are
[13:48] coming from
[13:49] foreign fields lord that will be with us
[13:50] in a couple of weeks we pray that you
[13:52] should bless them and give them travel
[13:53] and mercies keep the covet away so that
[13:55] we can have a good service here and at
[13:58] the camp meeting

[14:01] are sin-sick in the world father we know
[14:03] there are some out there that's still
[14:05] longing for you lord and we pray that
[14:06] we'll reach them
[14:08] that we'll show god as we talk about
[14:09] this morning those virtues is to show
[14:11] god not to show up you is to show god
[14:14] not show up our person
[14:16] the lord just bless this service and be
[14:17] with us in jesus name
[14:19] amen the bride said
[14:21] amen let me read you this quote from who
[14:23] hath believed our report listen to this
[14:25] right here
[14:26] some people touched the garment of jesus
[14:28] and was made whole others smacked him in
[14:31] the face and hid him in the head with
[14:32] sticks and spit in his face and never
[14:34] felt virtue at all
[14:36] it was their attitude of repro approach
[14:40] it depends on what attitude you come in
[14:43] if you come believing that you're coming
[14:46] to get help and you're confident that
[14:48] you're coming to the right person jesus
[14:50] christ and you're coming his provided
[14:52] way of approach you're going to receive
[14:55] something if you come reverently amen so
[14:58] that's what we come here for today we
[15:00] come here to receive something we didn't
[15:01] come here
[15:03] listen you didn't go back to the first
[15:04] grade
[15:05] you went to the second you went to the
[15:06] third you went to the fourth you went
[15:08] all the way into college and you learned
[15:10] every day it's a learning process
[15:12] same way with the bride of jesus christ
[15:14] every day is a learning process i hope
[15:16] you didn't come here just to hear a
[15:16] sermon i hope you come here to learn
[15:18] something
[15:19] god teach me something
[15:20] because this is his provided way look at
[15:22] all that brother rhymes in his divided
[15:24] way if you come to that approach
[15:26] you'll get something today
[15:28] so let's read the scriptures we've been
[15:30] reading for
[15:31] 48 times
[15:32] john 1 1 the word doesn't get old does
[15:36] it in the beginning was the word the
[15:37] word was with god and the word was god
[15:39] and the word was made flesh
[15:41] your flesh
[15:42] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[15:44] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[15:45] the father
[15:46] full of grace and truth romans 12 2
[15:50] says be not conformed to this world but
[15:52] be transformed by the renewing of your
[15:54] mind
[15:55] that you may prove what is that good and
[15:57] acceptable and perfect
[15:59] will of god that you may prove not me
[16:01] you
[16:03] not the prophet
[16:06] you
[16:08] prophet's gone on he can only we can
[16:11] only hear his voice
[16:13] right but we have to manifest what he
[16:15] said
[16:16] listen if jesus if jesus didn't die on a
[16:19] cross and didn't resurrect we wouldn't
[16:21] have nothing to be here for
[16:23] and then if the prophet of god hadn't
[16:24] come to bring us out of those
[16:25] denominations into this message
[16:28] we'd have no we could be we'd just be
[16:30] home
[16:31] or you could just go to a baptist church
[16:33] and get you a good sermon on how to live
[16:34] right and or well maybe not always live
[16:36] right but um say that you're not perfect
[16:38] and all that stuff but we come to be
[16:40] perfected
[16:42] statue of a white perfect man
[16:44] for i say through the grace given unto
[16:46] me to every man that is among you not to
[16:47] think of himself more highly than he
[16:49] ought to think but to think soberly
[16:51] according as god hath dealt to every man
[16:54] the measure of faith so there's a
[16:56] measure of faith there's different kinds
[16:58] of faith and we'll talk about that a
[16:59] little bit more
[17:00] as we go along for us we have many
[17:02] members in one body and all members have
[17:04] not the same office not everybody can be
[17:06] preachers not everybody can be
[17:08] uh deacons not everybody can be
[17:09] different things but you've got your
[17:11] place in god if you're here today and
[17:13] you're born again you've got a place
[17:15] all right because what is adoption is
[17:17] placing
[17:18] it's not to make you a son
[17:21] by the new birth you become son
[17:24] but now we've got something to do
[17:28] i mean what would be if i know i got you
[17:29] standing but it keep you from sleeping
[17:31] brother dahlin back there now i knew him
[17:33] when he was a young kid now what if i
[17:35] see him now and he's still that same
[17:37] young kid there'd be something wrong
[17:39] but he's grown up he's got a family he's
[17:41] got responsibilities he owns a company
[17:42] he does this he's and that's his what
[17:45] that's the same way in christian life
[17:47] you want to grow in god so god can give
[17:49] you a gift
[17:50] can give you something because look
[17:52] having then gifts
[17:54] differing according to the grace not
[17:55] everybody can play the piano
[17:57] or we'd have 14 pianos up here on the
[18:00] stage no it's a diverse group of people
[18:03] and we have to put each one we have to
[18:05] get in our places right remember what
[18:07] the prophet said
[18:08] right when we get in our position
[18:10] having been gifts different according to
[18:11] the grace has given us whether prophecy
[18:13] let us prophesy according to the
[18:15] proportion or portion of faith you may
[18:18] be seeing the lord had his blessing
[18:20] to the reading of the word you love the
[18:21] lord
[18:24] so the first stage we've been talking
[18:26] about for a long time but
[18:28] i was talking to the lord this morning
[18:30] and
[18:31] i said lord i just keep going over and
[18:33] over and
[18:34] the quote comes back to the prophet said
[18:36] when you gonna get though the lady said
[18:38] brother ryan when you're gonna get job
[18:40] off by that sheep right remember he
[18:42] preached so many discernment every how
[18:44] many sermons he preached when you're
[18:45] gonna get
[18:45] in other words when the people
[18:47] understand why he got on that ice sheet
[18:48] we'll get him off of it
[18:50] so when everybody understands that the
[18:51] new birth is not this message
[18:55] somebody say amen
[18:58] this message enhances your new birth
[19:02] it teaches you to grow but the new birth
[19:05] was taught before
[19:06] there was even a bible
[19:09] jesus said ye must be born again 2 000
[19:12] years ago this has been taught it's just
[19:14] been
[19:16] man says it's sprinkling man says it's
[19:18] pouring man says it's just
[19:20] saying hail mary's and and doing your
[19:22] penance and you see what i mean the the
[19:24] the world the men of the world as we
[19:26] read the other day they've got involved
[19:28] and their opinions have what
[19:30] jesus stood one day and said
[19:34] what you've done with the word of god
[19:35] has made it of no effect to the people
[19:39] because his word is effective
[19:41] it will not return void it will
[19:42] accomplish exactly what it said it would
[19:44] accomplish so if it if the word went out
[19:47] that you can get born again guess what
[19:49] there's somebody that can't get born
[19:51] again
[19:52] there's somebody that will receive that
[19:54] listen if we will all just forget and
[19:56] not have faith in the message of the
[19:57] hour where would we be
[20:00] where would you be
[20:02] most of us would be in the world
[20:06] flounding around all over the place that
[20:08] we might wander into a baptist church or
[20:10] might wander over into a methodist
[20:12] church
[20:13] our
[20:14] we got we got never mind we got
[20:16] denominations in this message
[20:18] just be careful where you go
[20:22] so the first stage is the birth we got
[20:23] to get the baby here we got to get
[20:25] because that baby has got to come into
[20:28] the world and get life
[20:30] wiggling muscles before in the womb then
[20:34] he's given life and we're going to
[20:36] discuss that a little bit later on
[20:37] sister freda had a question the other
[20:38] day
[20:39] we'll cover
[20:41] that subject on the
[20:44] seed
[20:45] so we'll cover that maybe a little bit
[20:47] later on but we got hey we got to get
[20:48] the statue of perfect man and if you're
[20:50] not born again you're not going to
[20:51] understand anyway
[20:53] that's why i'm hammering get born again
[20:55] get born again come to church read your
[20:57] bible do the things that god said i'll
[20:59] give you a promise if you do this
[21:01] and listen we're going to talk this
[21:02] afternoon we talk about faith this
[21:04] morning but we're going to have to talk
[21:06] about where james says that faith is
[21:08] dead
[21:09] without works
[21:12] but it's not all works
[21:14] brother branham thank god he come and
[21:16] preach works is faith expressed he put
[21:19] it all exactly the way it should be put
[21:22] man has argued said well paul said it's
[21:23] by grace james said this by works well
[21:26] they just tie right together
[21:29] i'll show you my faith by my works
[21:34] because you know i've got faith i've got
[21:35] faith i've got faith and set home
[21:38] and deny the word of god
[21:41] that what do you got faith in then
[21:43] it's not the word of god
[21:45] we've got to put our faith in the word
[21:46] of god
[21:48] romans 8 verse 14 first stage is the
[21:50] birth but the verse in three stages
[21:52] we've been talking about that
[21:54] for the last last six months i guess
[21:57] romans 8 14 for as many as are led by
[22:00] the spirit of god they are the sons of
[22:02] god for we have not received the spirit
[22:04] of bondage again to fear
[22:06] listen you were not born let me let me
[22:08] just give you this real quick you were
[22:10] not born with eternal life in your soul
[22:14] you were born a sinner
[22:16] you were born doomed and on your way to
[22:17] hell you were born contrary to god
[22:21] the bible says god will not dwell in an
[22:23] unclean vessel the bible tells us and
[22:25] even brother branham says look in the
[22:27] soul you either have faith or doubt
[22:30] either faith or doubt not both
[22:33] amen so if you've got this eternal
[22:35] something in your soul when you're born
[22:37] and you got the devil that's a two soul
[22:39] doctrine put in another book with
[22:41] another cover on it
[22:45] listen i believe you always were eternal
[22:47] in the mind of god
[22:50] because you do away with the whole plan
[22:52] why can't we just take simple salvation
[22:54] everybody in the message wants to just
[22:55] make us this great something we are
[22:57] great
[22:58] through god
[23:00] but other than that sorry rotten rascals
[23:04] born in sin shaping iniquity a spouse
[23:06] from my mother's womb a liar doomed and
[23:09] on our way to hell the prophet said he
[23:11] was on his way to hell now where did
[23:13] that eternal part come from
[23:18] only in god were you eternal always
[23:22] when you come out of your mama you were
[23:24] dead
[23:26] because that sees what's killing us
[23:29] now the seed word of god is what's alive
[23:33] and you weren't born with a word inside
[23:35] of you jesus was because he was the word
[23:39] come on people it's really simple but
[23:40] they complicate it so much preach
[23:43] sermons after sermon after sermon about
[23:45] all this come on
[23:48] if you don't take predestination i said
[23:50] oh i'm going to do this predestination
[23:52] you've got to take it by foreknowledge
[23:55] those he foreknew
[23:57] is first not
[23:59] if you take predestination
[24:01] they're doing the same thing in this
[24:02] message oh you always was so you had to
[24:05] come to this i'm going to pull you
[24:06] through it too brother brown said he's
[24:08] not going to pull you through a tube
[24:10] you have a free will
[24:12] to choose yes or no even cain had a free
[24:14] will
[24:19] oh but he was serpent seed
[24:21] no he was born from the real serpent
[24:24] amen
[24:25] we're serpent seed by birth
[24:28] prophet god said we were born between
[24:30] satan and eve
[24:31] that serpent
[24:32] so we were all born lost
[24:35] doomed i like that way you know why i
[24:37] like that way better
[24:39] because i can rejoice in my salvation
[24:42] i can rejoice that god justified me that
[24:45] he sanctified me and then he filled me
[24:47] the whole with the holy ghost where i
[24:48] was full of something else
[24:51] because remember you can't have two in
[24:53] your soul
[24:54] so if you were born in sin you got the
[24:56] devil there
[25:00] we've been reading where's that unclean
[25:01] spirit go out of
[25:03] your soul
[25:04] so you can't have clean and unclean you
[25:07] can't have fresh water in bitter water
[25:08] the scripture's totally clear they take
[25:11] the prophet to god and
[25:12] you know what they do i'm going to stand
[25:14] here and tell you today i'm going to
[25:15] stand just like jesus they have made by
[25:17] their traditions
[25:19] and their misquoting quotes they've made
[25:21] the message of the hour of non-effect to
[25:24] the people
[25:33] don't challenge me
[25:36] i'll take you upon your challenge
[25:39] for you have not received the spirit of
[25:41] bondage again to fear i feel free
[25:44] i were i was bound though i had fear i
[25:48] was in bondage
[25:50] but oh thank god he burnt that part out
[25:53] that unclean spirit went out of my soul
[25:57] and then god came in and did what burnt
[26:00] me
[26:02] you know what god can burn somebody and
[26:05] never even have a hint of smoke
[26:08] the three hebrew children the bible
[26:11] didn't just say they didn't get burnt
[26:13] the bible says
[26:15] their clothes didn't even smell like
[26:16] smoke
[26:17] that's how god can clean us up
[26:20] moses burning bush there's a burning
[26:22] bush burning burning bush
[26:25] that was not consumed
[26:27] you and i are that burning bush
[26:33] the holy fire god
[26:35] but it's not going to consume you it's
[26:37] going to change you
[26:39] it's going to change you it's going to
[26:40] burn you those burners are going to burn
[26:42] that old nature
[26:44] well when i get to it the renewing of
[26:46] your mind because see this is all
[26:48] contrary
[26:50] like i said before all these virtues
[26:52] even coming to church today is contrary
[26:54] to a lot of people
[26:55] oh hello somebody
[27:04] i'm just telling you folks
[27:06] i'm about the dumbest rock in the
[27:08] building
[27:09] and i got to come to church
[27:12] i got to renew bible didn't say that
[27:14] your mind was just totally clean right
[27:16] we're going to read it in a man it says
[27:17] by the renewing
[27:20] renewing
[27:21] of your mind
[27:22] being born again by the incorruptible
[27:25] word of god
[27:26] so i gotta come and get refreshed or
[27:28] renewed
[27:30] that's why i like wednesday night
[27:31] service too it's really intimate not so
[27:33] many people come i know some of you
[27:34] can't come that's okay
[27:36] but it's an intimate sitting
[27:40] some of the devils are not there and i'm
[27:41] talking about you not talking about you
[27:42] personally if you don't come on
[27:43] wednesday night okay
[27:49] he finished throwing
[27:52] but no there's demons follow you they
[27:55] come with you
[27:56] that's why you want to shut down i'm
[27:57] glad some people said it listen the
[27:59] older one said hey man the rest y'all
[28:00] was like i don't know where's that quote
[28:02] where brother said grief
[28:04] oh lord of mercy
[28:06] i was lost but now i'm found
[28:09] to me that's the whole thing
[28:11] and this message come to show me how to
[28:13] grow
[28:14] it showed me that there's more to god
[28:17] than just
[28:18] do's and don'ts
[28:21] there's more there's an enhancement
[28:24] there's something that gives us more
[28:26] my i was a i was really good in math but
[28:29] boy when i got into college
[28:32] wow
[28:34] what a step up
[28:36] i had to finally use my brain
[28:38] but it was refreshing
[28:41] when you know what you're doing
[28:42] listen when you have faith that's what
[28:44] we're talking about today when you have
[28:45] faith in what you're doing
[28:48] it raises you up another level that's
[28:49] why faith is the substance
[28:52] of things hoped for
[28:54] if we ever get there but you have
[28:55] received what the spirit of adoption so
[28:57] we in this end time
[28:59] have received the spirit of adoption
[29:01] whereby we cry
[29:02] out by father and the spirit itself
[29:04] bearing witness with our spirit oh okay
[29:07] that we are the children of god and if
[29:10] children then air theirs of god and join
[29:11] heirs with christ if so be that we
[29:13] suffer with him that we may be glorified
[29:16] together thank you brother bob we're not
[29:18] gonna
[29:19] talk about i told him i said you quit
[29:20] preaching my sermons would you
[29:24] i'm gonna read some of the same
[29:25] scriptures he did if i get to them
[29:27] but that's god softening everybody up
[29:29] getting everybody in the right frame of
[29:30] mind getting everybody in the right
[29:32] furrow to when we start digging it's not
[29:33] so hard to dig
[29:34] hey man i love a garden but you know
[29:36] what if you bust that ground up to start
[29:38] with as hard as a rock and your rows are
[29:40] like this because you're bumping off all
[29:42] but boy when you kill that ground up
[29:44] four or five times you can lay a
[29:46] straight row so we pray to god that god
[29:48] will lay you a straight road today
[29:50] all right so justification
[29:52] there's only one way to get justified
[29:54] that's by god now why would you need
[29:56] justification if you always was eternal
[29:59] listen listen the
[30:02] destroy wall brother the ink
[30:04] the ink went into the clorox and it just
[30:08] disappeared
[30:11] but there was ink
[30:14] your sins
[30:17] that's what that ink was it was you
[30:20] your sins was put in the sea of god
[30:22] forgiveness your sins were put in the
[30:24] bleach so there is sin
[30:27] that's your ink
[30:29] that's you
[30:31] and when you were put in then praise god
[30:33] satan can't find you no more
[30:37] your sins have been annihilated
[30:39] oh praise god that's justification
[30:42] but we don't lose that we keep that
[30:44] every day
[30:46] god please forgive me for what i
[30:48] did not for what i'm going to do
[30:52] that's catholic
[30:53] sorry about that but it is
[30:55] you can't get forgiven for sins you
[30:56] haven't done yet
[31:01] so anyway you said well you're too
[31:03] technical one word off
[31:05] one word got him out of the garden
[31:07] brother brown said one word off will not
[31:08] get you to heaven i mean a change of the
[31:11] body it can get you to heaven but not
[31:12] his body change all right we're looking
[31:14] at a body change that's what i want i
[31:15] don't wanna
[31:16] buy and buy when i die
[31:19] i want to be changed
[31:21] i want everything to be right
[31:24] so sanctification is what it's in your
[31:26] soul
[31:26] and then the unclean spirit goes out
[31:28] what of your soul
[31:30] so there must be something unclean in
[31:32] there why are we trying to get away from
[31:33] the bible
[31:37] oh well i've got this quote
[31:38] quotes will kill you
[31:42] but the essence of the message if we
[31:43] don't get the essence of the message
[31:44] we're all going to die in our own
[31:46] traditions
[31:48] in our own i think this is what he said
[31:50] same way we like daniel 70 weeks i'm in
[31:52] my heavens it's as simple as it can be
[31:55] but boy it's confounded to a lot of
[31:57] people
[31:58] if you'll just read your bible you'll
[31:59] get it
[32:01] let that teacher talk to you not let
[32:03] somebody else tell you
[32:05] anyway
[32:06] number one
[32:07] he said he'd give you a new spirit
[32:11] why do you need a new spirit if you got
[32:12] eternal life in there
[32:15] i'm glad you're quiet because i know
[32:17] that it's prevalent in the message about
[32:19] all this eternal seed and all that stuff
[32:21] it was it was there for you
[32:24] but what is a seed a scene is the word
[32:27] of god
[32:29] not a seed
[32:31] i heard one preacher of the day said oh
[32:33] when god created the earth all the seeds
[32:35] were there
[32:36] so basically what he was saying was when
[32:38] we were brought into the world all the
[32:40] seeds were there
[32:41] people that's just drunk
[32:43] drawing at straws
[32:46] brother brown was talking about literal
[32:48] seeds of of beans and potatoes and and
[32:51] trees and and corn that's what he's
[32:54] talking about
[32:55] something without a soul
[32:57] you got a soul
[32:59] and that soul is either faith or doubt
[33:02] can't be both in there at the same time
[33:05] because why would he give you a new
[33:06] spirit
[33:08] even at sanctification we ain't at the
[33:10] holy ghost yet
[33:12] is everybody all right with this
[33:14] he said he give you a new spirit now
[33:16] that spirit is a gods
[33:20] i thought god was already there
[33:23] it's not
[33:24] it's waiting on you
[33:27] to make a choice
[33:31] i'm telling you one more time
[33:34] if if if we come to the throne of
[33:36] judgment and we're standing here in
[33:39] judgment and we don't have to be judged
[33:41] right
[33:43] if adolf hitler walks up to the judgment
[33:45] bar
[33:46] and he looks at us and god explains that
[33:49] these are my children the reason they're
[33:50] standing here and i put something in
[33:52] them special
[33:55] you know what adolf hitler's going to
[33:56] say
[33:57] you're not a just god
[34:00] you didn't give me a chance
[34:02] you treated them different than you
[34:04] treated me because you sealed them all
[34:05] the way away
[34:09] god is the most just god there ever has
[34:13] been or ever will be
[34:16] no he's going to say these people were
[34:18] born just like you adolph
[34:22] but i came to these people
[34:25] and they received me
[34:27] i came to you and he'll tell him exactly
[34:29] the date he came
[34:31] and you turned me down that's the
[34:33] difference between them and you not that
[34:36] i made these people so special
[34:38] but now that we're born again yeah amen
[34:40] we are special
[34:41] we don't have to go to the tribulation
[34:43] we don't have to go through the judgment
[34:45] why because we receive something
[34:50] i'll shout it from the housetop that
[34:52] doctrine is wrong
[34:57] it does away with all salvation why
[34:59] jesus have to die if we came here
[35:01] already eternal
[35:04] oh but it laid there dormant how can you
[35:05] have something eternal and it be dormant
[35:10] so jesus had eternal life the whole 30
[35:12] years he walked and he was just dormant
[35:14] no no he saved the whole world with that
[35:19] i got to get off of that all right
[35:22] so look
[35:23] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[35:25] then he says
[35:27] why would he need to put his spirit
[35:28] inside of you if it's already there
[35:33] but the thing god has to do is give you
[35:35] a new spirit
[35:36] make your nature
[35:38] a little more gentle
[35:40] because your old adamic nature is still
[35:42] there
[35:46] dead
[35:46] black
[35:50] then he then he brings you a spirit to
[35:52] soften you up
[35:54] look make your nature a little more
[35:56] gentle and settle down or he couldn't
[35:58] even live with you
[35:59] i thought he's already living in there
[36:02] no
[36:03] he's not going to dwell in an unclean
[36:04] vessel
[36:09] and i know
[36:11] just free to send me that quote where
[36:12] brother ryan was talking about
[36:15] um
[36:16] eternal life is putting you
[36:17] what do you say
[36:19] it's the foundation of the world not at
[36:20] your birth
[36:22] so now let's go back to the mind of god
[36:23] then there we were
[36:25] not people brother brown what were we
[36:27] before we were born he said nothing
[36:30] only in the mind of god
[36:32] were you a seed or a word not a little
[36:34] germ seed
[36:36] the word of god is a seed go back to
[36:38] your bible does the bible say the word
[36:40] is the seed the sower son of man sowed
[36:44] seed not germs
[36:47] he was sowing the word of god
[36:50] and then you responded to that part of
[36:52] the word of god and god said that's my
[36:56] children i knew he would choose it if i
[36:58] put it in front of him because i saw him
[37:00] already choose it before the foundation
[37:01] of the world there's your answer
[37:05] i was
[37:06] lost folks what i did in my body and
[37:10] spirit and soul when i was a sinner god
[37:12] was not anywhere to be found
[37:16] now he was there now listen we're giving
[37:18] an angel i know
[37:20] i know the quotes
[37:21] that's what gets me is you know you
[37:23] you start um
[37:25] people start bringing out their doctrine
[37:26] and then you you kind of
[37:28] go against it or something and and they
[37:30] start you know what brother brown said
[37:33] daniel 70 weeks you know there's
[37:36] i said man i already read those
[37:39] i said my the reason that i think that
[37:41] the god has given us the revelation
[37:43] right is because i can take those quotes
[37:45] and these quotes and put them together
[37:48] but you by your doctrine has to deny
[37:50] them quotes
[37:52] you gotta deny the bible
[37:55] if you think you were born something
[37:56] special
[37:59] born in sin
[38:01] the whole bible's full of sinners by you
[38:03] know what brother bob said though look
[38:04] even backsliders
[38:06] you got a chance
[38:08] you just you backslid amen
[38:11] seeing you of what purified your souls
[38:13] what
[38:15] i thought it always was
[38:17] no it's a process
[38:19] purify your souls and obeying what the
[38:21] truth yes
[38:23] not a lie through the spirit under what
[38:25] unfeigned love of the brethren see that
[38:27] you love one another with a pure heart
[38:29] fervently that's why i'm so fervent
[38:31] about this i want us to be right i want
[38:33] us to grow up the statue of perfect man
[38:34] with no limitations i want the headstone
[38:37] to be shown with no limitations i don't
[38:39] want part of it i want it all
[38:43] because it didn't tell me right down
[38:44] here let me go back right here and it
[38:47] says
[38:48] right here and if children then heirs
[38:51] heirs of god and part joint heirs with
[38:53] christ
[38:54] that's not what it says
[38:56] it says joint heirs with christ whatever
[38:59] he gets we get
[39:01] he got a change of the body we're going
[39:03] to take a change of the body amen
[39:09] the difference in me and you and him
[39:11] he was born right
[39:14] we weren't
[39:16] being born again not of corruptible seed
[39:18] but of incorruptible
[39:20] by the word of god there's your seed
[39:23] which liveth and abideth
[39:25] forever romans 8 29 for when he those
[39:27] whom he did what
[39:29] for no
[39:31] he did predestinate or he did predestine
[39:35] that's what predestination means pre
[39:37] before you get started destination
[39:41] pre-destination
[39:43] but you got to go back to for knowledge
[39:46] before that
[39:47] because the bible didn't say for those
[39:48] who he for not for for those he
[39:50] predestinated he foreknew the bible says
[39:52] for whom he did for no amen
[39:55] he had knowledge beforehand he's god he
[39:57] knew what a god did you know we've got
[39:59] eight billion people on earth almost
[40:01] today he knows what everybody's thinking
[40:02] right now
[40:04] and the ones that are dead and gone on
[40:06] he knows where everyone is at
[40:08] every star that fell out of heaven he
[40:10] knew where it was when he when he
[40:12] created it so let's don't think we can
[40:13] get anything on him
[40:16] for whom he did for no
[40:19] he also did predestinate
[40:21] to be conformed to the image
[40:23] of his son
[40:24] that he might be the first born he had
[40:27] to be the firstborn son of man had to
[40:28] come in human flesh
[40:30] he was spirit god
[40:32] then he became the son of man right
[40:37] moreover whom he did predestinate then
[40:39] he also called why did he call him
[40:41] because he foreknew him
[40:44] everybody getting that you've been
[40:46] taught predestination by brother dale
[40:47] for 40 years the right way
[40:51] and whom he called then he justified
[40:53] yeah i'll give him clown clap too
[40:55] give god the praise
[40:57] whom he called then he also justified
[41:00] and whom he justified not you justifying
[41:02] yourself
[41:04] then he also glorified somebody read
[41:06] that scripture this morning
[41:08] romans 11 verse 2 says look god hath not
[41:10] cast away his people which he for you
[41:14] he can't cast him away because he knew
[41:17] your decision
[41:19] and he knew you wouldn't change that
[41:20] decision but he also knew he could give
[41:23] adolf hitler a million years to repent
[41:25] and he knew he could see down through
[41:27] time i'm going to give hitler 85 years
[41:30] to repent he knows he's not going to do
[41:32] it i'm going to give him 85 more
[41:35] he gave the world 120 years to repent to
[41:39] know his message and not one of them did
[41:40] except those eight
[41:44] but you know what god let him preach 120
[41:45] years
[41:47] you know if i was god i just said well i
[41:48] already know what they're going to do i
[41:49] think i'll just go out here we're going
[41:50] to have a flood we're going to put them
[41:51] in the ark we're gone we're done i got a
[41:53] bride i'm going to save them i'm going
[41:55] to rapture them we're going to come back
[41:57] let's have a millennium no
[41:59] god's got a plan
[42:01] and inside that plan we'll get to it
[42:03] later on inside that plan there's
[42:04] salvation for others
[42:11] i mean this ain't us foreign no more
[42:14] god's going to save a group of people
[42:16] you and i
[42:18] are the bride
[42:19] then he's going to save the jews then
[42:22] he's going to save the church
[42:24] hello somebody
[42:25] then he's got a foolish virgin that's
[42:27] going to be given eternal life he's
[42:28] going to have health and he's going to
[42:29] give eternal life to he's going to give
[42:30] me eternal life a cup of water in my
[42:32] name so that's why the plan is so long
[42:35] god's so gracious to give us all time to
[42:38] repent and i promise you folks your
[42:41] time's about over
[42:44] like i said before this is a i could
[42:46] have a big glass of water up here but
[42:48] there is a bottom to it
[42:50] there's one day when god said that's
[42:51] enough
[42:52] you played all you gonna play i'm done
[42:54] it's time to go home because there's a
[42:56] group of people
[42:58] that knew
[43:00] where the bottom of the cup was
[43:03] that's you and me
[43:04] god hath not cast away his people which
[43:06] he for knew there's no way he can cast
[43:08] you away now that part of predestination
[43:11] i agree with
[43:13] because he foreknew you
[43:15] he knew you would fervently love him he
[43:17] knew you would do the little things
[43:22] ephesians 1 10 then in dispensation of
[43:24] the fullness of times he might gather
[43:26] together in one all things in christ so
[43:28] this is not this is not my show and
[43:31] william branham's show and this one show
[43:33] it's god's show
[43:35] it's god
[43:36] amen god will not share glory with no
[43:38] one else so we ought to just give him
[43:40] the glory right now and forget about the
[43:41] rest of it if he wants to give me some
[43:43] gifts hallelujah i'll take them
[43:45] but he's the bridegroom we're the bride
[43:48] don't get him mixed up
[43:50] that's why the world's so mixed up they
[43:51] don't know what gender they are now
[43:53] well look at the churches
[43:55] don't you know that's where that spirit
[43:56] came from churches
[43:58] they don't give him no headship don't
[43:59] look at me like that freda
[44:02] when you get the furrow and you you know
[44:04] like that
[44:05] they don't give him headshit folks so
[44:08] they don't care what gender they are i
[44:09] mean look at the spirits these spirits
[44:11] just don't pop up out of hell
[44:14] the religious realm is what opens up
[44:16] spirits
[44:20] the two her thousand 000 demons they
[44:21] were locked in the river euphrates
[44:24] amen and brother brown said loose on the
[44:26] world
[44:27] that's not what he said
[44:29] loose on the bride
[44:32] to drive her back to the homeland
[44:39] that's a lot of demon
[44:42] but we shall overcome
[44:44] he gave us something to overcome with
[44:46] he gave us the true baptism of the holy
[44:48] ghost and when i say true that means in
[44:50] your soul you can have the baptism of
[44:51] the holy ghost on your spirit every day
[44:52] of your life and die and go to hell
[44:54] that's what the prophet said and i
[44:56] believe it i know that for a fact i can
[44:57] you can see it working in the people
[45:00] how the people have been under this
[45:01] message for 20 and 30 years and all of a
[45:03] sudden something clicks and they leave
[45:06] you can't leave this message and have
[45:08] the holy ghost
[45:09] you can't i'm sorry hold on
[45:11] that's wrong
[45:12] you can't leave this message and have
[45:14] the new birth
[45:15] you can have the holy ghost anointing on
[45:17] you every day of your life and die and
[45:18] go to hell preach like a lark
[45:21] i told you about that one preacher that
[45:22] i wat i watched the whole sermon he
[45:24] preached on the millennium and he did a
[45:25] good job i still got notes that i
[45:27] preached off of and he was sleeping with
[45:29] a 14 year old girl at the time he was
[45:31] preaching
[45:32] message believer
[45:35] so don't tell me see you can be anointed
[45:37] you have to watch that anointing why
[45:38] brother graham preaching oil ones at the
[45:39] end time
[45:41] anointed with the true holy ghost
[45:45] being predestinated
[45:46] look in him also we have obtained
[45:51] you got to go get it i read you the
[45:53] scripture last sunday the kingdom of god
[45:54] is taken by force
[45:56] this is not a picnic it's a battle
[45:59] you're gonna have scars
[46:01] but you're gonna be victorious
[46:04] and him also you have obtained an
[46:05] inheritance being predestinated
[46:08] according to the purpose of family worth
[46:09] all worketh all things after the council
[46:11] of his own will that we should be to the
[46:12] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[46:14] christ
[46:15] all right he comes first who first
[46:17] trusted in christ look in him also you
[46:19] also trusted after yes
[46:22] listen we're powerless without the holy
[46:25] ghost
[46:26] you shall receive power after that the
[46:28] holy ghost has come upon you
[46:30] you shall look after you heard the word
[46:32] what after you heard the seed
[46:36] you responded to that
[46:39] and god planted that
[46:41] inside of you
[46:43] the gospel
[46:44] of your salvation
[46:46] and him also look after that you believe
[46:49] so you got to hear it
[46:51] then you got to believe it
[46:54] that's what we're going to talk about a
[46:55] little bit later on you got to have
[46:56] faith in this
[46:57] you got to have faith that god can even
[46:58] save you
[47:00] that's a monumental faith because you
[47:02] know what there's 7 billion people in
[47:03] the world right now probably six and a
[47:04] half billion of them don't care
[47:08] don't have faith enough don't even
[47:10] believe in a god
[47:11] they believe in a buddha or they believe
[47:12] in a that a butterfly is god and you
[47:15] know your ancestors can come back and
[47:17] ants and
[47:18] and whatever
[47:20] and also you trusted after that you
[47:22] heard thank god you heard the word of
[47:24] truth
[47:25] if you're born again today you did
[47:27] somewhere receive the word of truth the
[47:30] gospel of your salvation
[47:34] in whom
[47:36] also after that you believed
[47:40] you were sealed with that holy spirit
[47:43] i promise why did i need a ceiling if i
[47:44] already had it
[47:47] because i didn't have it
[47:49] you didn't either
[47:51] is the earnest of our inheritance
[47:53] earnest down payment
[47:55] brother brown said little button
[47:58] right remember since holy ghost is like
[48:00] a little button it comes in you it grows
[48:02] which is the earnest of your inhere our
[48:04] inheritance until the redemption of the
[48:06] person's possession what is the person's
[48:08] possession
[48:09] this guy
[48:10] unto the praise of his glory john 14
[48:12] verse 25 said these things have i spoken
[48:15] unto you being yet present with you but
[48:16] the comforter which is the holy ghost
[48:18] whom the father will send in my name
[48:20] he shall teach you of all things and
[48:22] bring all things to your remembrance
[48:24] whatsoever i have said unto you you know
[48:26] what satan wants to do now he wants to
[48:27] block your remembrance
[48:29] he wants to block the day that you got
[48:31] born again he wants to block the day
[48:33] that you went to virtual knowledge
[48:35] temperance because it's what if you
[48:37] don't have a mind renewal or the
[48:38] renewing of your mind your mind is going
[48:41] to take you back to that old dynamic
[48:42] part
[48:44] because now it's attached to your spirit
[48:46] realm
[48:48] because remember faith or doubt inside
[48:51] your soul which is the real you
[48:54] right
[48:55] faith or doubt one of the two i'll read
[48:57] it either today or
[48:59] tonight
[49:00] one of the two
[49:02] and you yield
[49:04] but what happens when you get born again
[49:06] satan's driven out
[49:08] you're sealed in so he can't get back in
[49:10] he tries to come back in with those
[49:11] unclean spirits right
[49:13] so what does he do
[49:15] he takes the second court
[49:18] the devil's persistent he's a lot more
[49:19] persistent than we are
[49:21] he comes to church when you don't
[49:25] and he's the one that keeps you from it
[49:30] well amen anyway
[49:32] so now he's working on your spirit realm
[49:36] where he's still again faith or doubt
[49:41] brother branham
[49:43] told the story about the old indian
[49:47] right
[49:49] in me now in other words after his
[49:51] conversion
[49:53] in me now
[49:55] i have two
[49:56] dogs that's not his soul be born again
[49:59] it's not the soul you've got to go to
[50:00] the outside realm
[50:02] memory reason conscious affection
[50:03] imagination your spirit realm
[50:06] so he says which one wins
[50:09] chief
[50:10] he said the one i feed the most
[50:12] in other words the one i let the one i
[50:14] let out from the inside
[50:17] is god but now sometimes the old devil
[50:19] is still on the outside because you know
[50:20] what he's persistent
[50:24] i walk back in
[50:26] i was comfortable weren't you
[50:28] comfortable
[50:30] oh lord
[50:33] he'll get you drunk
[50:35] make you feel comfortable until the next
[50:37] morning
[50:39] he'll peel you up and shoot you up make
[50:42] you feel real good till the next morning
[50:45] so you kids don't you do stuff like that
[50:47] you flee from that junk
[50:49] it will not give you anything but
[50:51] temporary
[50:52] enjoyment but there's a god that'll give
[50:55] you internal eternal enjoyment
[50:57] i'll promise you you just try him one
[50:59] time try my god one time
[51:01] i've tried i tried satan's god a long
[51:03] time try god one time
[51:06] one time
[51:08] lady man
[51:10] and he said unto them and it's not for
[51:11] you to know the times or the seasons
[51:12] which the father has put in his own name
[51:14] this is jesus speaking but you shall
[51:16] receive power after
[51:19] now watch the holy ghost i just read to
[51:22] you that was a comforter
[51:24] which god's going to send in my name
[51:27] why's he got to send him if he's already
[51:29] there
[51:31] see what i mean
[51:33] you can't feed me that junk
[51:36] i was lost
[51:38] i needed god
[51:40] i needed that burning of the holy ghost
[51:42] to come and give me power
[51:44] it says you shall receive power after
[51:48] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[51:50] and you shall be witnesses unto me
[51:52] that's why brother branham in a church
[51:53] age book he said the denominational
[51:55] churches are what cold formal and
[51:58] powerless because they don't have the
[52:00] new birth they just have maybe a good
[52:02] case of sanctification or maybe god
[52:05] saved me from my sins and god will save
[52:07] them
[52:08] but they're not born again
[52:10] they still got that old nature and they
[52:12] can't get away from it that's why they
[52:13] wear their pants and they'll curse every
[52:14] once in a while and say oops you know
[52:21] because they hadn't had the burner come
[52:22] in and burn that thing out
[52:26] what brother mom tell us he said the
[52:27] most ill-taught subject was what
[52:29] the seals
[52:31] daniel 70 weeks
[52:32] the most ill-taught thing is what
[52:34] the new birth
[52:37] the most ill-taught subject he said in
[52:39] the 60s
[52:41] was the new birth because they teach it
[52:42] as this they teach it as that you always
[52:44] was
[52:45] or you go shake a hand or you write your
[52:47] letter in the baptist church and make
[52:48] sure you got a letter of good standing
[52:51] and we if you never go to church again
[52:53] we'll still bury you under the baptist
[52:55] and we'll send you to heaven if you need
[52:56] to
[52:57] but you shall receive power after let
[52:59] the holy ghost that's why you can't
[53:00] receive listen you can have
[53:03] excuse me earthly virtue you can be
[53:05] virtuous never touched by a man never
[53:07] touched by a woman and still dying go to
[53:09] hell
[53:10] but you can't have the virtue of god in
[53:11] your soul working and die and go to hell
[53:14] that's where you let it out and let
[53:16] people draw from it
[53:19] and you shall be witness unto me in
[53:21] jerusalem judea samaria
[53:23] lula georgia
[53:25] that word we know is dunamis
[53:28] it's an inherent power
[53:30] power residing in a thing by virtue of
[53:32] its nature
[53:34] we had to have a nature change
[53:36] i like that last one moral power and
[53:39] excellence of soul
[53:41] so that means your soul wasn't excellent
[53:42] at one time
[53:45] because god's not going to dwell in an
[53:46] unclean vessel how in the world is he
[53:48] going to dwell in something that he
[53:49] cursed
[53:54] he cursed it
[53:58] uh
[53:59] okay
[54:01] in every age watch this
[54:03] every age is the age of the holy ghost
[54:05] for the true believer now brother i'm
[54:07] true believer everybody believe brother
[54:08] brown was a prophet
[54:09] am i preaching this
[54:11] some of you must not be in you there's
[54:12] another church over there you all need
[54:14] to go to it starts at 11 o'clock
[54:17] you better believe that god sent us a
[54:19] prophet to straighten this thing out
[54:22] and i say every age the evidence was the
[54:24] same those who had the spirit the
[54:26] teacher heard the word and that spirit
[54:29] in them took the word and taught it or
[54:32] revealed it to them today if you've got
[54:34] the holy ghost there's a teacher inside
[54:36] of you that's saying come on amen sick
[54:38] them this is the truth i want some more
[54:41] i want to grow
[54:46] but you had to hear it
[54:49] because you can't do away with
[54:50] ephesians he give apostles prophets
[54:53] pastors teachers and evangelists
[54:54] i didn't set this thing up he did all
[54:57] right if you got a problem talk to god
[54:58] about it
[54:59] took the word taught it revealed it to
[55:01] him look they were of the group
[55:03] that heard the message and messenger and
[55:07] his message

[1:01:48] to get
[1:01:49] or procure a thing for oneself
[1:01:52] to possess to marry your wife
[1:01:56] second that first thessalonians 4 4 said
[1:01:58] every one of you should know how to
[1:01:59] possess his vessel
[1:02:01] in sanctification and honor and i wrote
[1:02:03] stature that's where that scripture
[1:02:05] right there to me triggers
[1:02:07] what we have to do
[1:02:09] every one of you should know how to
[1:02:11] possess is this not your vessel
[1:02:15] that's your vessel
[1:02:16] and you got to know how to possess your
[1:02:18] vessel
[1:02:19] because you know what if not
[1:02:21] you're possessed of one or two things
[1:02:24] you're possessed of the devil
[1:02:26] or you possess the god
[1:02:28] so there's your confession
[1:02:31] is your pro possession
[1:02:35] because look to acquire get
[1:02:38] or procure for oneself
[1:02:40] you know who's your worst enemy regina

[1:03:06] time i haven't helped at all has it to
[1:03:08] try to get me straightened out
[1:03:10] no
[1:03:11] try to get yourself straightened out
[1:03:13] we're on worst enemy why because our
[1:03:15] confession
[1:03:19] there was a lot of confessions outside
[1:03:20] during the baptismal service god's going
[1:03:23] to hold you to that confession because
[1:03:25] if you don't confess you won't possess
[1:03:29] you'll be possessed all right where's a
[1:03:31] lot of people in this world that's
[1:03:32] possessing the devil
[1:03:34] but you know what they let him in
[1:03:38] i'm my own worst enemy so i let him in
[1:03:43] every one of you should know how to
[1:03:45] possess
[1:03:47] your vessel
[1:03:48] in sanctification
[1:03:51] and honor let's read this statue of a
[1:03:52] perfect man
[1:03:53] what is sin
[1:03:55] unbelief
[1:03:56] now here's a quote i was going to get to
[1:03:58] there's only two elements
[1:04:00] that control the human being
[1:04:02] two
[1:04:06] that's either doubt
[1:04:08] or faith one or the other you're
[1:04:11] possessed of one that dominates
[1:04:14] your life
[1:04:16] just depends on how much faith you have
[1:04:18] is how high
[1:04:20] you can rise
[1:04:23] you're possessed
[1:04:24] of one that dominates
[1:04:27] your life
[1:04:30] which one wins
[1:04:32] when i feed the most
[1:04:35] manifestation of the spirit 1951
[1:04:38] toledo ohio up there close to where you
[1:04:40] all live
[1:04:41] now you come to the altar realize you're
[1:04:42] a sinner and you're sorry for your sins
[1:04:44] now watch this you repent of what you've
[1:04:46] done and you can stay there and cry for
[1:04:48] a week in a week out
[1:04:51] and it would never save you until you
[1:04:53] believe in your heart
[1:04:55] that you are saved is that right then
[1:04:58] you confess it that's right now he can't
[1:05:01] do nothing for you until you confess it
[1:05:05] is that right for he is the high priest
[1:05:07] of what of your confession
[1:05:11] he can do nothing look how we bind god
[1:05:15] we bind the word of god
[1:05:19] you confess me before men i'll confess
[1:05:21] you before the father is that right what
[1:05:24] you say i've done down here for you
[1:05:25] that's what i say the father in other
[1:05:27] words you come down and died for us that
[1:05:28] i've done for you he's the high priest
[1:05:30] you get that young man he's talking to
[1:05:32] some young man yo man young man y'all
[1:05:33] get that
[1:05:35] the high priest of your confession
[1:05:38] now here he is sitting here to make
[1:05:40] intercession on your confession not just
[1:05:42] that you're going to make an idle
[1:05:43] confession but when you confess there's
[1:05:45] an intercessor standing there going i'll
[1:05:47] take that
[1:05:48] i'll take that
[1:05:50] he's confessed but you know what listen
[1:05:53] in a court of law
[1:05:56] i'll get my notes out here in a court of
[1:05:58] law
[1:06:00] hearsay is not evidence
[1:06:05] hearsay is not evidence inadmissible in
[1:06:07] the court of law cause this one said
[1:06:08] that that one said that that one said
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:10] but what is a testimony you come to the
[1:06:14] judge or come to the
[1:06:16] jury or you come to the courtroom and
[1:06:18] you what you testify
[1:06:21] about what you saw
[1:06:24] not what you thought you saw
[1:06:26] that's a testimony
[1:06:29] same way in your christian
[1:06:30] life how are you going to be convicted
[1:06:33] of being a christian
[1:06:34] if you don't act like one
[1:06:39] would there be enough evidence
[1:06:41] if god took us to court and said
[1:06:43] you decide whether they're christian or
[1:06:45] not
[1:06:46] look at their life look at their
[1:06:48] testimony
[1:06:50] their testimony listen
[1:06:52] a testimony is only what's admitted as
[1:06:55] evidence
[1:06:57] here says not
[1:06:59] secondhand information is not but a
[1:07:01] testimony is admissible in a court so
[1:07:04] god can only be your intercessor
[1:07:08] if you don't have a testimony
[1:07:11] and it's got to happen to you
[1:07:13] not somebody else
[1:07:15] it's your testimony
[1:07:17] that's well withheld or held up in a
[1:07:19] court
[1:07:20] the prophet of god said in the 70th week
[1:07:22] of daniel i said i'll imagine when it's
[1:07:24] sifted they'll watch this
[1:07:26] they asked somebody asked asking said
[1:07:27] somebody said brother why are you so
[1:07:28] hard on the people it looks like you're
[1:07:29] kind of in other words you know you
[1:07:30] preach and this one leaves and you're
[1:07:31] preaching this belief
[1:07:33] or you preach against the baptist or
[1:07:34] you're preaching against the methods
[1:07:35] you're preaching against something when
[1:07:36] you get the real pure in heart born
[1:07:38] again of the spirit remember this was
[1:07:40] the only church age that christ was put
[1:07:42] out of his own church of all of them
[1:07:44] you've got a great confession but do you
[1:07:47] have a possession it's what we're
[1:07:49] talking about
[1:07:51] is christ really in the church
[1:07:54] it'll be very much
[1:07:56] in the minority
[1:08:00] simon peter servant apostle jesus christ
[1:08:02] i read that but we're going to continue
[1:08:03] reading the scripture to them that what
[1:08:05] have obtained like precious faith with
[1:08:07] us through the righteousness of god and
[1:08:09] our savior jesus christ let me ask you a
[1:08:11] question real quick
[1:08:13] peter and them were with jesus
[1:08:15] after he after he came back everybody
[1:08:18] with me here just for a second we'll
[1:08:19] preach on this a little bit later
[1:08:21] but here jesus comes back glorified
[1:08:24] everybody with me
[1:08:26] he said look
[1:08:27] go to jerusalem i read the scripture a
[1:08:29] couple weeks ago until you be what
[1:08:30] endued
[1:08:31] with power from on high
[1:08:33] and then the bible says he breathed on
[1:08:35] them
[1:08:36] and said receive you the holy ghost
[1:08:40] now why didn't they get it right then
[1:08:46] hmm
[1:08:49] wheels are turning
[1:08:51] why didn't they get it i'll correct i'll
[1:08:52] read you the bible i wasn't going to go
[1:08:54] this way but we're going this way read
[1:08:55] your bible
[1:08:56] after jesus glorification he's standing
[1:08:59] there in a glorified body he's telling
[1:09:01] them to go to jerusalem to wait and be
[1:09:03] endured with enude with power from on
[1:09:05] high and he's in the upper or wherever
[1:09:07] he's at right before his ascension and
[1:09:10] he breathes on them the bible says and
[1:09:12] says receive you the holy ghost
[1:09:14] now buddy right then would have been
[1:09:15] when that seed or whatever they were
[1:09:17] supposed to have we just went
[1:09:19] hello somebody
[1:09:22] but that wasn't the way it was
[1:09:24] he was the seed
[1:09:26] and brother branham thank god for a
[1:09:28] prophet he said potentially
[1:09:31] in other words it puts you in line to
[1:09:33] get it
[1:09:35] listen we don't go get in line from
[1:09:36] mcdonald's to get a burger king
[1:09:37] hamburger
[1:09:39] you get in the right line brother dale's
[1:09:41] always said don't buy a bus ticket go
[1:09:42] the airport and expect to go somewhere
[1:09:45] you gotta get the right ticket to the
[1:09:46] right place
[1:09:47] i believe we're trying now to get the
[1:09:49] right take you to the right place
[1:09:51] get in line
[1:09:54] but why didn't they receive it then
[1:09:56] because it was all still in jesus
[1:09:58] cause he prophesied
[1:10:00] go to jerusalem and wait
[1:10:02] until you be endued with power from on
[1:10:04] high
[1:10:06] so now let's go 11 days to the upper
[1:10:08] room
[1:10:09] that promise became vindicated because
[1:10:11] 120 little jesus were born again
[1:10:15] and they received
[1:10:17] the holy ghost
[1:10:18] amen look at paul all these different
[1:10:21] look at the apostle paul now when god
[1:10:23] struck him down on the river i mean on
[1:10:25] damascus road right
[1:10:27] now remember paul was going to be a
[1:10:28] prophet
[1:10:30] church age messenger
[1:10:32] he was going to write 80 of the bible
[1:10:35] but look
[1:10:36] he ever thought about just think simple
[1:10:38] with me just for a second
[1:10:45] thank god for a prophet if i ever said
[1:10:46] that before thank god for a promise
[1:10:49] because he said bride don't persecute
[1:10:50] bride
[1:10:52] amen you know what he said bride don't
[1:10:54] persecute bride
[1:10:56] what did paul do
[1:10:58] i'm gonna sit down a minute let you
[1:11:00] think about that what'd paul do
[1:11:02] before his conversion what did paul do
[1:11:06] persecuted bride
[1:11:09] caused them to blaspheme
[1:11:12] and go to their death
[1:11:15] but paul had this seed in him really
[1:11:18] then he shouldn't have been persecuting
[1:11:19] bride
[1:11:21] because bride can't persecute brian no
[1:11:22] paul was lost
[1:11:25] paul did not have the holy ghost
[1:11:28] paul did not have a seed planted inside
[1:11:30] of him now he had a seed before the
[1:11:31] foundation of the world in the mind of
[1:11:33] god waiting on a day when paul would
[1:11:35] come to a crossroad
[1:11:37] god would strike him off of a horse and
[1:11:39] oh he should have got it there buddy
[1:11:41] that thing should have went pow
[1:11:43] oh yeah i got it and paul's over going
[1:11:46] no you know what god
[1:11:48] struck him blind
[1:11:51] and he goes over to the seed body that's
[1:11:53] already got the new birth
[1:11:55] a nice
[1:11:57] and said a nice i'm going to send you
[1:11:58] somebody
[1:12:01] who lord
[1:12:02] saul oh no lord
[1:12:05] i know you don't make mistakes lord but
[1:12:06] could you reconsider that maybe send him
[1:12:08] to somebody else maybe my neighbor bob
[1:12:12] said no brother bob bro bob take care of
[1:12:14] him
[1:12:15] god said no i got a purpose for this man
[1:12:18] but my only the only life he's going to
[1:12:20] get is going to come through the body
[1:12:22] and anas had to lay hands on him and the
[1:12:25] scales fell off of his eyes and he
[1:12:27] became what paul
[1:12:30] the church age messenger paul the
[1:12:32] born-again believer paul the preacher
[1:12:35] that put 80 of that bible together
[1:12:38] there's where paul came to his
[1:12:40] quickening but he had to receive it
[1:12:47] grace and peace be
[1:12:48] multiplied unto you through the
[1:12:50] knowledge of god in jesus our lord
[1:12:52] according what as his divine power has
[1:12:54] given unto us all things now did you
[1:12:56] have that divine power before no you
[1:12:58] didn't
[1:12:59] you had a power all right
[1:13:02] it was a devil power
[1:13:04] to all things that pertain to life and
[1:13:06] godliness through the knowledge of him
[1:13:07] that hath called us the glory and virtue
[1:13:09] whereby our given unto us what exceeding
[1:13:11] great impression somebody say that with
[1:13:13] me exceeding
[1:13:14] great and precious promises that by
[1:13:17] these promises
[1:13:19] you might be partakers of the divine
[1:13:21] nature having escaped hallelujah
[1:13:25] escaped because you were bound you were
[1:13:28] in prison you were headed for hell you
[1:13:31] were headed for death
[1:13:33] you were headed for annihilation from
[1:13:34] god
[1:13:39] that's what i can praise god for
[1:13:42] he took me out of that
[1:13:45] because he stole my choice
[1:13:48] not that i'm scared to go to hell
[1:13:51] no i was going
[1:13:54] but having escaped the corruption that
[1:13:57] is in the world
[1:13:58] through lust oh that sounds like great
[1:14:01] we just go home now
[1:14:03] pretty well you're looking at now
[1:14:07] and besides this
[1:14:09] you can't hide your feelings and besides
[1:14:12] this
[1:14:12] giving look and besides this oh it's
[1:14:14] great we got it
[1:14:16] we got this big old wide faith down here
[1:14:20] we we're gonna let it renew our mind and
[1:14:23] face is the substance and we live by
[1:14:25] faith and god give us all these promises
[1:14:28] and besides this
[1:14:31] peter knew his birth
[1:14:33] birthed him
[1:14:35] but he knew he had to have work done
[1:14:39] he had to have the master sculptor
[1:14:44] still cut away
[1:14:46] from paul
[1:14:47] peter
[1:14:49] james
[1:14:50] john
[1:14:52] charlotte
[1:14:53] brother collie
[1:14:55] from brother
[1:14:56] amen
[1:14:59] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:15:01] the divine nature having shaped the
[1:15:02] corruption that is in the world too lust
[1:15:04] and beside this
[1:15:06] that's what we're going to talk about
[1:15:07] and besides this
[1:15:09] giving all diligence i had to now it has
[1:15:11] become something different it's become
[1:15:14] your face amen
[1:15:16] it's your faith when you receive the new
[1:15:18] birth thank god for a prophet everybody
[1:15:19] believe god sent a prophet right
[1:15:21] okay brother brown said this is my eye
[1:15:24] god gave it to me
[1:15:27] all right this is my new birth god gave
[1:15:29] it to me so now this is my faith because
[1:15:32] that's what i live by i live by faith
[1:15:37] i'd hate to be faithless
[1:15:40] but even the world believes in something
[1:15:42] but you know what they'll believe in
[1:15:43] something over here and then this one
[1:15:44] will fall then they'll jump over here
[1:15:45] and say well i think we're believing
[1:15:46] this one over here well oh well he's
[1:15:48] just human so i just believe in this one
[1:15:50] over here oh lordy
[1:15:53] now faith is the substance of things
[1:15:54] hoped for look the renewing of our mind
[1:15:56] the evidence of things not saying we'll
[1:15:57] cover this real quick and then we'll
[1:15:59] then we'll close this afternoon for by
[1:16:01] the elders what obtain a good report
[1:16:03] faith and works all right through faith
[1:16:06] we understand that the worlds were
[1:16:07] framed by the word of god so that things
[1:16:08] which are seen were not made of things
[1:16:10] which do appear
[1:16:11] but by faith abel offered unto god a
[1:16:13] more excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:16:16] and now there's a doctrine in the
[1:16:17] message that abel was righteous from his
[1:16:19] birth see they always they go back to
[1:16:21] why do you need a sacrifice
[1:16:24] why did we need a sacrifice
[1:16:27] if abel didn't need a sacrifice if he
[1:16:29] was righteous from birth
[1:16:30] what he needed for
[1:16:32] that sacrifice is laying there for your
[1:16:34] sins
[1:16:36] my sins
[1:16:39] we've just become a bunch of religious
[1:16:40] sinners
[1:16:45] sorry about that if it hurt should have
[1:16:48] by faith and visitors sorry i don't
[1:16:50] usually preach like this
[1:16:51] by faith
[1:16:53] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[1:16:55] sacrifice than cain by which he what
[1:16:57] obtained
[1:16:59] why is that word obtained keeps coming
[1:17:01] up
[1:17:02] you could have get something
[1:17:05] able had to take that sacrifice lay it
[1:17:07] on a rock take a rock and
[1:17:11] and blood just going everywhere
[1:17:13] you hit something in the jugular vein
[1:17:14] you all know you've seen animals die man
[1:17:16] it's just like
[1:17:18] it's not pretty but you know what
[1:17:20] god's sacrifice on calvary wasn't pretty
[1:17:22] either
[1:17:23] but it was the prettiest thing i ever
[1:17:24] seen in my life
[1:17:26] it was the absolute prettiest thing i've
[1:17:28] ever seen in my life
[1:17:32] which he obtained witness that he was
[1:17:34] righteous he obtained a witness he was
[1:17:35] righteous he didn't born righteous
[1:17:38] god testifying of his gifts and by it
[1:17:40] being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch
[1:17:42] was translated that he should not see
[1:17:43] death
[1:17:44] and was not found because god had
[1:17:46] translated him for what before his
[1:17:47] translation he had this what testimony
[1:17:52] he was in the court with a testimony
[1:17:54] that he pleased god
[1:17:56] and then that judge said okay you please
[1:17:58] me
[1:18:00] the attorney says you please me and then
[1:18:02] lord you look over and he's the jury too
[1:18:05] but without faith it is impossible
[1:18:08] to please him for he that cometh to god
[1:18:09] must believe that he is what he is god
[1:18:12] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:18:14] diligently
[1:18:16] seek him let's read this right here
[1:18:18] and then we'll stop
[1:18:20] we'll continue this right here this
[1:18:22] afternoon we won't do a lot of
[1:18:23] background this afternoon
[1:18:25] now we want to speak now upon faith
[1:18:27] and a different type of faith so there
[1:18:29] must be different types of faith
[1:18:31] all right we proved that the other day
[1:18:33] we just kind of backed up a little bit
[1:18:34] here that's a great thing now faith
[1:18:36] we're told in the bible faith cometh by
[1:18:38] hearing now you cannot be saved without
[1:18:40] faith
[1:18:41] and faith is something that you have to
[1:18:43] believe it's there
[1:18:45] that really nothing else will declare
[1:18:48] it's there but faith
[1:18:53] now i'm trying to bring faith to you so
[1:18:54] that you can be ready for this prayer
[1:18:56] line in a few minutes now faith he that
[1:18:58] cometh to god must believe that he is
[1:19:00] and it's impossible to please god
[1:19:02] without faith you cannot please him and
[1:19:04] if you say you believe god you've never
[1:19:06] seen him
[1:19:07] so then you've got to believe it by
[1:19:09] faith and if you could see him it
[1:19:11] wouldn't be faith
[1:19:13] we're going not we're not going to need
[1:19:14] faith in jesus christ when we get a
[1:19:16] glorified body and we're in the
[1:19:18] millennium
[1:19:19] he's going to be right there with
[1:19:20] us when you receive
[1:19:23] your healing
[1:19:25] you don't need faith for that same
[1:19:27] healing again
[1:19:28] if it goes away like it's supposed to
[1:19:30] now we know it can come back so but
[1:19:32] watch this right here talk about moses
[1:19:34] just for a second magicians get ready to
[1:19:36] come
[1:19:38] this is the burning bush experience
[1:19:40] which brother brown said everybody needs
[1:19:41] a burning boost experience
[1:19:43] here i am in the bush burning go down
[1:19:44] there i'll be with you he didn't need a
[1:19:46] stick he had the word the vindicated
[1:19:47] word there he went it anointed the faith
[1:19:49] that was in him
[1:19:51] oh it anoints our faith it moves us out
[1:19:53] in great cycles it separates us from
[1:19:56] other things of the world no matter how
[1:19:57] little we are
[1:19:59] or how much a minority we are how much
[1:20:01] we've laughed been laughed at made fun
[1:20:02] of don't make a bit of difference that's
[1:20:04] all
[1:20:05] we just see it
[1:20:07] there is something within us we were
[1:20:09] predestinated to see this hour why by
[1:20:11] foreign knowledge
[1:20:13] amen here god has spoken it's already
[1:20:16] happened we see it oh how we thank god
[1:20:18] for this and then it brings out your
[1:20:20] faith when you see these things
[1:20:22] happening here listen it ought to make
[1:20:24] your faith stronger as prophecy is being
[1:20:27] fulfilled not weaker
[1:20:29] because that's the spirit of fear the
[1:20:32] spirit of fear makes you fearful of all
[1:20:34] these prophecies that are coming to pass
[1:20:38] be not conformed to this world but be
[1:20:39] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:20:42] that you may prove that you may prove
[1:20:44] listen we are the only people that's
[1:20:46] going to prove this message is right
[1:20:49] the only people
[1:20:51] that's going to prove this message is
[1:20:52] right
[1:20:54] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:20:56] acceptable and perfect will of god for i
[1:20:59] say through the grace given unto me to
[1:21:00] every man that is among you not to be
[1:21:02] think of yourself more highly than he
[1:21:03] ought to but to think soberly according
[1:21:05] what god had dealt to you the measure of
[1:21:07] faith
[1:21:08] we talked about measure but also
[1:21:10] renewing is what renovation
[1:21:12] complete change for the better
[1:21:15] and i wrote myself a note
[1:21:17] because the virtues are contrary to god
[1:21:23] no the virtues are contrary to you i
[1:21:25] wrote that so some of you say man i
[1:21:27] treat you
[1:21:28] no the virtues are contrary to you
[1:21:35] you see virtues displayed out there
[1:21:39] one more time
[1:21:41] no
[1:21:42] the only verse the only time you're
[1:21:44] going to see true virtue is right here
[1:21:45] in the bride
[1:21:46] you draw strength from the bride you
[1:21:48] draw strength from talking
[1:21:50] fellowshipping doing the things of god
[1:21:52] but you were born contrary to god
[1:21:55] amen that's why i said about the new
[1:21:57] birth but these virtues are contrary to
[1:21:59] you
[1:22:01] look watch this brother and say look
[1:22:02] have faith
[1:22:04] and be born again
[1:22:05] that's laying the foundation
[1:22:08] jude 1 verse 3. let's read this and then
[1:22:09] musicians come on beloved when i give
[1:22:12] all diligence to write unto you the
[1:22:13] common salvation it was needful for me
[1:22:14] to write unto you and exhort you that
[1:22:16] you should what earnestly contend for
[1:22:18] the faith which was once delivered unto
[1:22:20] the saints for there are certain men
[1:22:22] crypt and underwears white false
[1:22:24] teachers
[1:22:25] who were before of old ordained to this
[1:22:27] condemnation ungodly men god by
[1:22:29] foreknowledge knew they would be here
[1:22:31] turning the grace of our god into
[1:22:33] lasciviousness and denying the only lord
[1:22:36] god in our lord jesus christ so there
[1:22:38] must be something
[1:22:39] because it says look
[1:22:43] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:22:45] once delivered so there was a faith that
[1:22:47] was lost
[1:22:48] and this afternoon we'll explain we we
[1:22:51] we make the quote or we make the saying
[1:22:54] faith of the fathers
[1:22:56] and maybe you don't know what that is
[1:22:58] but i'm gonna explain it
[1:23:00] this afternoon we'll start right there
[1:23:02] with the faith of the fathers let's
[1:23:04] stand
[1:23:05] but that was lost
[1:23:07] that faith was lost back in the church
[1:23:08] ages that faith was lost because man
[1:23:10] said oh i think he's three
[1:23:13] oh i don't think he's the substance of
[1:23:15] god he's a lock substance of god oh i
[1:23:17] don't think we need to baptize in
[1:23:19] the way peter said
[1:23:22] we're going to baptize the way the lord
[1:23:23] said
[1:23:25] right
[1:23:26] they got all these ideas
[1:23:28] so we had to have somebody come back and
[1:23:31] elijah as we're going to read this
[1:23:32] afternoon and elijah come back and
[1:23:35] restore that faith back to have what
[1:23:37] faith in the word of god not faith in
[1:23:40] man's ideas or a catechism or or
[1:23:44] apostle's creed
[1:23:47] those catholics believe in those rosary
[1:23:48] beads man they get in trouble they'll
[1:23:50] pull them things out and they'll start
[1:23:51] holy mother of god and you know saints
[1:23:53] of this and saints of that
[1:23:55] took god completely out of it
[1:23:58] don't even pray to jesus
[1:24:01] wouldn't did god do that
[1:24:04] no mr devil did that
[1:24:06] to what to not do away with the word of
[1:24:08] god but to make it of none effect
[1:24:11] to the believers amen let's sing a song

[1:29:06] the mercy seat there's a man sitting
[1:29:08] there but all of a sudden he's going to
[1:29:11] raise up
[1:29:13] and he's going to leave that throne
[1:29:16] and the altar is going to become smokey
[1:29:20] and he's going to stand out and he's
[1:29:22] going to change
[1:29:24] his garment
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:28] to judgment
[1:29:30] and there's no way he's going to go oh
[1:29:32] wait a minute i forgot one no
[1:29:34] god don't forget
[1:29:36] once he steps off of that mercy seat
[1:29:39] it's over for us folks
