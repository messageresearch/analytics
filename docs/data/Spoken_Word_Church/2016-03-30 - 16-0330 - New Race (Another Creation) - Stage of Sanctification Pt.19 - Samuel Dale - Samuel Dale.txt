«  137       †        Each person setting here's filled with something. (Then I'm going to close. I may have to after that.) You're filled with something. You can't set there without being full of something. You've got a life in you. That life governs you, and that life is governed by a spirit. Now, you might be full of the world, loving the world or the things of the world. God be merciful to you. You might be full of creeds from some church, some little prayers that you say, you think that it's going to--or pray to some dead person, or--or make some kind of a sign across you. God be merciful to you.
    And you may be full of religion; and that's worse yet. That's right. That's right. The Bible said in the last days they'd be very religious, having a form of godliness--having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away. If you're full of religion, you're miserable: just religion, that's all. If you're full of creeds, you don't know what you're talking about. If you're full of the world, you're blind.
    And then again, you may be full of the Holy Ghost. Amen. I hope you are. And if you're not, I hope you get full. And if you're full of the Holy Ghost, what you got? You've got power; you got love; you got peace. "My peace I'll give unto you, not as the world giveth I you." You got peace; you're sealed. You got a sign. Amen. You got rest. You got joy unspeakable and full of glory. You're anchored. Oh, my. That's what you are with the Holy Ghost. You have... If you got full of the Holy Ghost, you have passed from death unto Life, waiting for the general resurrection in the last day.

anyone else anything that we have that's all just pray Lord Jesus we thank you for tonight thank you that Lord that during the middle of a week of a Time Lord that we're all busy and bustling in life and doing things that we can take a little time off and just sit down under the shade tree and and listen to you Lord and let you speak to our hearts and our lives we ask you to forgive our sins most of all and keep us clean by the blood because that's what we believe in and We Praise Your Great Name just come tonight and speak to us and give us Thy word that we would have for tonight we love you and we thank you be with these others that are not here be with the sick ones Lord and just touch each one thank you for all things and we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen if you'd like turn in your scriptures are we we're going to read from revelation 3:14 and then we'll go to John 17 Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of sans right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and remember we are the rest of that creation according to the prophet on paragraph 146 proven his word all right now let's go to John because we'll be dealing with sanctification tonight and as much as we possibly can anyway and uh you know we'll read these scripture John 17 verse one these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him and this is eternal life what that they might Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent amen I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the foundation of before the were was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest un gavest me out of the world and watch coming down to the church now the the called out the disciples and things I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy word and now they have known that all things whatsoever thou Hast given me are of thee for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me now read these yourself and keep in mind what he's saying to the disciples he gave them the word God gave them to him it's not two people there but it's coming out see and and showing where they're at watch and I pray for them I pray for not for the world right but for them which thou gavest me for they are thine and all mine are thine and all thine are mine and I am glorified in them now and now I am I am no more in the world watch now see he's fixing to leave going out all right but these are in the world and I come to thee Heavenly Father keep thy thine keep through thine own name Those whom thou Hast given me that they may be one as we are now how was he and the father one the father come and dwell in him right so how is it with us while I was with them in the world now once I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled and see he kept Judas up to the last right he kept him up to the last but then he went away all right and now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them Thy word and what what he does with the word now and the world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the the world I pray not that thou should us take them out of the world much you know look like he said well get us out of here you know no he doesn't do that but that thou should us keep them from the evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world watch him now sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth and as thou has sent me into this world even so I also send them into the world how did he do it he come and dwelt in them and went right that's what he's doing now and for their sakes watch I sanctify myself that they they also might be Sanctified through the truth and you can go on down and pick up more but we'll stop there because we we get enough scripture you may be seated and now we took Sunday both Services expressing you know is talking about coming to this new birth that we believe that if you're born you know you have to be born again to be in the Kingdom you can't see you can't enter the kingdom and things you have to do those things all right and then we're coming down to a point of talking and we did Sunday and we titled the first part of it you know about the the justification and then we got up into the point of talking about in the afternoon of the stage of justification all right now what did the prophet say there's three stages right amen justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost you don't shortcut it you can't just jump in real quick and say well I didn't need them others I was live so good until I didn't need to be cleans and you know forgiven I was just oh great Glory I wish I could say that and I I wish you could but I know you can't so that solves a problem but not to be hateful to be just plain and Truth All right but we went through talking about justification and we went into the future home and talking about these things that the prophet has brought unto us and we believe that what we talked about it Sunday from the message Christ as a Myster God reveal that God could be revealed now what is it what is the new birth Pro the prophet it said Christ a mystery it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then we were dealing with it Sunday God is known by Simplicity and revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person that's right all right so now that means the most illiterate person can be saved thank you Lord all right see we think they don't have enough mental capacity but it shows to me that you don't have to have this great head knowledge but you have to believe what you've heard amen you know you have to believe it all right but then it's it's not taught by most everybody of the new birth and that we need it and that's why brother Ram we got on to it on birth pains where he says there's not very many genuine new births that's right amen why because they just sympathize with it yeah yeah I like that that's a good idea they want to stay with the old system you know their old church allies their old thoughts their old ways you know they want to stay with that and claim the new birth are the message of the age all right see then coming on over into especially into our day in time of the message of the age that we're living in and they want to hold to that old system their old ideas and you see them in the message that that people would even say you know well boy I'm glad that was brought out because you know I always kind of believe something like that you know well that's that's all right if it's truth but to believe something that it's not truth in trouble right then we went on talking about that very few would believe unto receiving the Holy Spirit right so very few genuine new births very few will receive the Holy Spirit the way that it's supposed to be all right and doing that he went in and we talked about justification as by faith in the word of God all right now I don't want to leave that because I want us to stay with the point so what we'll do is we'll just pick up from where we left off Sunday and we'll we'll read some of the things that we read there because it will be not only in the stage of justification it goes right on into sanctification so that's where where we're going on into it now on the doing so if the brothers will start we'll pick up and we'll start on the future home and we'll reread some of the things that we talked about because we're a firm believer and that was on the message uh Church order preached in 1958 he explains we believe in justification by faith we believe in sanctification by the blood we believe in the baptism with the holy spirit so that was 58 all right then when he comes up here to to speaking on the future home in 1964 he said he want to make it plain he said it was a great confirmation a great loving blessing when I see this and see that since a boy first time ever dealt Christ dealt with me I've always taught those three stages of Grace they always taught the three stages of Grace well then why would it come into the people of the message now say well he changed this and he changed that you know well that's that's nothing to me but it's just something that you know I don't want you to get caught with it so then I warn you to be aware of what you listen to as to the great beautiful explanations of things that seems to be right but will not work out all right so we'll drop back now and we'll just come up from where we were and then we'll go right on through Reading because it's a continuation of reading so you'll watch that from from the future home so we talking about it Sunday and what did he say the first step is repentance toward God Then followed that is water baptism water baptism repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ see water baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine are to remit our P sins that has nothing to do with future sins see it's justification just chops off the pie sins all right see we sin again you know say I come to alter and I'm ask the Lord to forgive me and he forgives me well that's gone into SE of forgetfulness is totally annihilated but the next time I sin what do I have to do that's right so what did we read off the one in church order 1958 what do we read what the pro he said you be justified he said but what he say maybe that person go on drinking smoking problems y well no no no brother Dale when I got Justified I quit everything you quit everything but lying is that blown enough because it's it's humanly impossible all right you say but I I know I experienced that I know what happened 5 minutes after I repented of my sins right I'm just honest see all right you say but yeah but look look I when I got went to the altar I quit everything well praise the Lord you're a wonderful person but now brother brownon says it don't matter what you got to be filled with something so now what was you filled with so we'll get to that but look that has nothing to do with your future sin it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what far remission taking away of the pie sins has nothing to do with the future just your sins has been chopped off what you did you can't repent for what Adam done you never done it Adam did it you just get forgiveness or what you done the old nature is still there all right now what did we use so go ahead and pull up to number one on the drawing Brothers we're going to try to juggle some books tonight if we can okay pull up the number one that shows all of the drawing that we'll get to it when it comes on down because we're going to read it in just a minute all right now here's the way brother Rand says things he said here's a human heart here's a human heart all right he said this one up here has got a snake in it it's got sin in it and and he said it's got a life he said this one down here has a dove but he says it has a life all right now but how do you get from here to here see because that's the stages is there and you you can think and say well brother d i don't agree with you but he said I here's a human heart here's a human heart why not make it the same human heart because regeneration is to take this man to be this man right yes irregardless of what you want to think about that you got to do this but it's stages of that it's not done just when more all at one it can be right I don't mind quoting scripture to you because it's the house of conus they said can anybody feid water see that these have received the Holy Ghost that we did at the beginning all right so it's possible but not very probable ever how you say that because the prophet said very few people will believe all the way amen but it's not saying you can't right I'm not trying to emphasize you can't and you didn't that's between you and God right there's no way that I can have anything to do with between you and your savior all right but see then watch what he says okay go ahead with number two now brothers and pull up drop that off we'll get back to it in just a minute because we just got through with the uh which would be paragraph 89 and of future home number two I hope these that Tak can read them out there cuz we we worked on it but all right now watch cuz this is a continuation we read first what we read the first step repentance toward God that's paragraph 87 and 88 all right explaining what that has nothing to do with your future it only remits Okay now what's he saying then he steps to the board and he says now let me illustrate he said here's a human heart and here's a human heart all right now this one over here has a snake in it that's sin here he has his life now watch that quote throughout theight and more Sunday and keep on about what is that he said here he has his life this one over here has a dove in it which is the holy spirit here he has a life right now what is he talking about here he has a life because I thought the drawing that he was making was a drawing of an individual or really the soul of an individual because he didn't draw the three rings to come through justif I mean come through something through the body and then through the spirit and then into the soul you know and the doing he goes straight to the message and draws a heart a soul of an individual all right and in that soul is where the new birth takes place it doesn't do any good to get rid of some of the body out here that's well and good it doesn't do any good for the spirit part to work because you're not born again in your body you're not born again in your Spirit you're born again in your soul the real you all right now so when doing it watch see he brings it to a point well this one here he has malice hatred Envy that's what causes it is this fella now remember that in a minute there's your snake right we'll get back to the draw in just a second with this one here he has malice hatred envy and what's causing it is this fell here well this one over here has love and joy and longsuffering and that's what does it down here all right now you're supposed to have kept your drawing so look at your drawing and you got the one up here with a snake in it you got little lines in there said sin then you got down at the bottom you got one with a dove in it all right now keep that in mind as you're going so watch what he says and when you ask you're forgiven of your sins you're only done this taken that away what did you take away sin right you only took your sin away right now we'll put the drawing back up in a minute what but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil is still there notice then you repent and the baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your sins all right now while we're at it drop back to number two on your your uh Hearts brother I tried to label this one two three where it would come so you just look at your own and look at what you got all right now here's the one that we're dealing with we don't have to worry about the guy down here that's got the dove in it we'll get to him later but it's a long ways down there right all right so here what do you got sin and you got the snake this is what made you do it was the old root of evil we'll get to that in a minute now look what happens when you take the sin out what have you got you're still not right that's what he said that's right he said you can repent and everything he said but you're still not right he said because the thing that made you do it is still there that's right amen all right so what did you do when you repented the sin went out so what do you look like that right there the old root of evil don't go out when you repent that's what we're going to read from the prophet that's right all right so do you see what it's doing now we're going from this stage to this stage all right so now drop back to where we were what was you on you were on uh you're still on number two with the reading but the thing that made you do it see you're forgiven of your sins you only done this taken that away you took out the sin but where you left all right but the thing that made you do it is still there you see our thinking is that if we repent it gets rid of the devil uh-uh it gets rid of the sin right right amen of the individual right all right we're going to go into scriptures and things with it now watch see watch what he calls it the thing that made you do it is still there so what did we do in the second part of the drawing sin gone snake left the old root of evil all right that's the root of evil it's still there notice then you repent and baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of your sins and notice now watch this then then secondly comes sanctification told you this is a continuation of reading which sets our mind in order for Holiness see watch what these things that happens at sanctification right amen record these things that happen at sanctification go sanctification which sets our mind in order for holiness now working up here yes right working up here yes starts working up here yes but where's it working at now the Bible said if the mind that was in Christ be in you to make a new creature now that's not his brain right so that mind is not the mind that we talk about the the part up here that's running the it's the mind that's inside of you right cuz that's where he's working at he's not working on your body he's not working on your spirit and the new birth it works back outward that's right it works from the inside of the Soul that's right right all right secondly which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right now watch it and you'll see when we'll get back in a minute we'll try to cover some things in our lives that will make us think about where we were that's my goal is to to get us to think about our lives and where we came from all right so look set our mind in order for Holiness to think right taking away sanctification is a compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service all right so we have to read these in it because it's dark we'll get to that later then the next comes the baptism of fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in us and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and puts the Holy Ghost Inside all right now watch that and hold that when the Holy Ghost comes I would ask you to write this down when the Holy Ghost comes it's going to get rid of sin but but but brother the sin was gone up here already that is just what You' done back there this is going on right right and we're going to get to something maybe I hope tonight what's now and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin and put the Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth the same life that this did because that that's in us all right they explains a natural birth come on up with notice in the natural birth when a woman gives birth to a baby the Natural Life tpes a spiritual life woman gives birth to a baby what comes for water blood and spirit life all right when a baby watch when a baby's born into the kingdom I can't help but cover the things he's saying cuz if I isolate him you'll say I'm changing something so I'm just reading it every B right you can say but you change that over here well now if he says it then you argue him where he changed all right now watch the baby is when a baby is born into the kingdom of God it comes the same way water blood Spirit the three stages justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost now notice sanctification the third stage now you know he didn't mean it that way second stage of it cleanses the Mind sets the heart the mind of the heart in order of Holiness now was I right hoo it don't set the brain it don't set the brain that's what he said cleanses the mind not this up here brain not that that cleanses the Mind sets the heart now the heart if you draw that heart of an individual then you're going to have to draw another Circle outside and say Spirit five senses and then another outside and say body right he just didn't put them there all right but now watch cleanses the Mind sets the heart the mind of the heart heart in order of Holiness now watch him he drops back to justification a man can repent sin and he's still thinking well maybe he's an immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds it's still there maybe he's a drunkard every time he smells a drink it's still th se but when he gets Sanctified so now he's dropped back to justification but when he gets Sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him that's righten watch him it takes the want of it away now watch he can still be tempted but he takes the want of it away still he's not right yet he's only set aside for service all right now let's stop right there just a minute stop right there and think about it sanctification then what does it do it cleanses the desire out of us we repent of our sins and God chops them off that's justification all right then what comes next sanctification all right what about the sanctification what does it do cleanses the mind that heart that he's drawed cleanses it right now go ahead and pull up number number three brothers and let's look at it we got a lot of doing you think I'm go ahead and pull up number three I tried to give these in step one two three where they could pull them up here's what caused you to do it but when it goes out you're clean and when it goes out you're clean okay wonderful picture but it don't have the dove in it that's right doesn't have the dove no right now watch him see all you've done is cleaned up the soul right now as we get to it what happened to you when you repented of your sins you know may back young or old or whatever you do you ask God to forgive you he took out the sin amen but what caused you to do it is still left MH see because all it done is chopped off the past done nothing to the future is that what we're quoting then comes sanctification to drive that unclean Spirit out now we'll keep on going in just a minute on the other to drive that unclean Spirit out of you all right now what about when you get the unclean Spirit out of you okay you say well it's beautiful there cuz there's nothing there all right now there where our trouble for the next four hours is going to be we won't stay that long tonight we'll continue Sunday okay justification chops off your P sins sanctification starts dealing with listen starts dealing with your nature because there's your nature right amen right right you're the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not that's on uh souls and prison if not it's of the world right so now what does God have to deal with to try to get this into this stage you know from the night to the Purity he dealing with your nature when you're born again you don't get a New Soul amen you know you know what I mean new another different Etc no I thought we believed in regeneration amen now if you got another Soul then you're throwing that way and you get another one that's not replacement you know I mean that's that's replacement that's not Resurrection amen we're supposed to be dealing with a new birth Amen to redeem the individual amen right and we're totally dealing with these services for the past two now and for two or three more we're totally dealing with the soul the heart that's the life that you are your being and what you are amen so sin chopped off now we're going to read the scripture in just a minute where Jesus says the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man but I want you to think about this what is the unclean Spirit right now watch my point that I tried to bring out the other day you remember this one when you look down at a baby and it's born in sin shaping in the world un shaping iniquity come the world speaking lies you look down that say look at that little Old Devil now that ain't no devil it ain't even age of accountability so it can't be even accounted of anything right see we think about the devil coming to live in us when I'm talking about that we are born in Satan's domain amen and we have to agree to that right his kingdom Jesus we read it I'm not of this world what is the world Satan's kingdom amen right right right his domain all right now when you go and do something wrong well that that's everybody said that's just the devil you got a point but what are you going to do with the person right amen but but brother Dale right there is a snake that's your nature that's the nature of this entire being that you are that's right because that's your soul in Bible terminology is called a heart right soul that's what you are we're not dealing now with body not dealing with the senses of the body dealing with senses of the spirit no no we're up above that now amen so don't drop back in your mind and say well this here that just stay with me and listen see when you repented of your sins all it done was chopped off the sins of that now listen was it the sins of the body that was chopped off oh yeah the body's what done it was it the sins of the spirit well yeah have to be the spirit one no now you you can't disbelieve with your body that's right right memory reason conscious and things is not dealing with disbelieving that's why brother random is so specific to if I could take the next three days two hours each day and talk about Sin right amen because here it is sin is unbelief amen right that's our definition that's R R's definition but what about when he said he sinned every day yep what about when he said you sin every day that's right is that unbelief or is it the spirit and the body activating and working and trying to control come on it's impossible for a born- again Christian to sin that's right so then the sinner he just sins all the way but a Christian a born again Christian can't sin in his soul how can he you can't do it so then you work back out into the spirit and you work out into the body and we do things wrong because we're part of a being but not within the soul right but even in that part of the Soul with that snake in it that's just a nature of what you are amen it's not you this is you it's just something has come to motivate you it's not a devil that comes and lives in you I want to get that out of your mind cuz see we you can't rule like that well I was just a devil then you turn around and say do something you say devil made me do it I don't blame the devil for everything I volunteer for 90% about of it and I know you do too so then that leaves it solves a problem but see we look as I said we look at a baby that's born into sin sh iniquity SP from Mother's it's born that way it's doomed and on its way to hell right but it's not a devil right there it's not a sinner right there because God will not account anything to it until the age of accountability right right amen that's right so then we just say oh that's the devil you say well this old snake here that is just that Old Devil it's the nature of the devil that has come into us in the being of our soul that is not to just say a devil in there it's our nature it's our ways all of our life we've lived as a nature of ways the way we are the reason you do the reason you know that that some people do this and some people do that and what is it natures and ways right and see that's not a devil because even if we take it in the stages of the Antichrist and the things what is it you remember the other day when I said it what dides he start off Antichrist false prophet and here's where people missing brother brandham they'll only they'll they'll watch him they'll go Antichrist false prophet Beast there no such thing it's Antichrist false prophet incarnate false prophet Beast the Incarnate even see the Antichrist is not we'll get to that where brother R calls it a religious part of you of the Antichrist see that Antichrist goes into a deeper state with the person right first they're an antichrist they're doing pretty good second they start being controlled by the devil in their thinking third they become to an incarnate stage that's not incarnate as the devil inside of you but there will be a time when that false prophet will become the Incarnate devil now listen he doesn't know how to become incarnate devil until God becomes incarnate in you so now does it mean that when God comes and becomes incarnate in me and you that that's God or is it you with God God ruling and controlling which one is it you see what I'm trying to get us away from the thinking well that's just a devil devil made them people do that well sure cuz he's a motivator right but he doesn't come down and live in people like we call it brother around let's see he said those fallen angels He said what he said they give you a nature right y now you need that quote I'll be glad to find it those Fallen Angels back there remember 2/3 of them now technically brother Bram will always use 2/3 but technically scripture it talks about 1/3 okay now I'm not saying he's wrong I'm just saying that we don't understand why he uses 2/3 instead of a third because the Bible says a third of the Angels fail he said but those demons give us a a nature right that's right see that's where they start at in these children that's right you watch these children they're starting a nature being built in them right brother Ryan in order to know it more than any he's got four 1 2 3 four right together but he can look down and see a nature in each one of those kids that the other ones don't have that's not all together bad C it's all together good because it's got to be that way right we're not talking about how bad everything is see that's our point we want to make a devil I said we well that that's a devil in that child we'll send them down here to the to the reform what know what did they call it where you send them used to be a you know you sent them to a home you know and put them in a home uh what milleville used to be the The Nut House The Nut House you know they send you to a nut house cause you crazy and come find out a lot of them wasn't crazy at all they had mental defici IES because of the food that they were eating there was a lady down at Gillsville who used to live there I remember she was a school teacher and she just went haywire and started doing everything and they couldn't figure out what in the world was wrong with her she started doing bad things they come to find it out she had a deficiency in the food she was eating sure I mean you see somebody out there because of the food they're eating and they're acting this way and you see somebody out here you think's a devil and they're acting that way what one what are you going to be come on I'm trying to get one thing if I don't I'll take the whole night cuz I don't care I want this dwelt into our hearts and our lives to get away from that devil made me do it may I quote brother ROM he said if you did you had to go out because he can't come in that's right amen well I know I done that the other day but the devil maybe do it it might not be the devil you're dealing with right it might be that old nature trying to may I quote run around he's got to be dead cuz if not he'll raise back up we're going to get that in a minute but watching he'll raise back up and you can remember when you was in churches before when they repented of their sins and they walked good for a little while and then things started coming back right what happened but you get the point when we come up through there we repented of our sins all right and remember the way I was have been teaching and I believe it that you can only follow the amount of word that's being preached to you that's right amen now I didn't make the statement brother Brown was one that said it he said nobody can touch the teacher said you got to have that part I didn't make that part you call me a teacher call me anything you want to call me a devil I don't care I'm just telling the truth I can't I quote what he says see because that's what it's to be the five-fold ministry is the five-fold ministry right but there's just one there that in the teaching of the word is above but yet the prophets are above him as far as seeing visions and different all right but you see we got the idea and that's what I'm trying to get us to look at the drawing when you got rid of the sin you still had the old thing that caused you to sin that's right that's right because that Soul did not get born again at justification that's right amen that's why I said it's the same heart you start off up here and you wind up down here with a dove you start out up here as every individual everybody in the world is born that way born in Satan's domain motivated by the devil he makes us and brings us to a nature within us and that nature is that unclean Spirit now are you following me well brother Dale now here's where we go to brother Dale my daddy done this so I got to do this go do this somewhere else and don't talk to me about it my daddy was a drunk but I didn't have to drink I never touched it so then it don't work that way right well there so and so there in these genes you can argue genes all you want to I argue hereditary traits not hereditary genes well it's all these homosexuals they got these genes in them where' to get it from hey I know a little bit I know you can close your eyes and then after a while you can't see I know that but are you listening into what I'm saying when that unclean spirit is there that's the nature of your soul amen right that's what it is that's right it's an unclean Spirit signified as a snake because of that being in the Bible all right now as it does then that doesn't mean you're so devil possessed no you're devil oppressed from the time you're a baby are you listening all up through your life you picked up a nature you act like somebody you look like you know you actually wind up looking like people and you act like people and they're they're doing why because that develops a nature right we tell the story about the little boy and the daddy walking the little boy struggling to try to step in his Footprints right and said Daddy I just trying to follow you well that's why I was so hard and screaming our Sunday about it what and the other week about it we let those demons come in our children now you can't beat them out but you can pray them out you can love them out you can do a lot of things you don't have to love a in either don't worry about it it going to be automatic yeah but if you don't raise them children to serve God they're going to serve something y right right I got them in here after a while we'll get to it where brother around says what he said you every person in the world he said is full of something he say it's impossible to be a human being and not be full of something right right amen but are you listening right justification just chops off your pie sins sanctification starts dealing with the nature of the individual in his soul not in his body in his spirit stick with me on what I'm saying you say well I remember when this happen I remember remember when Christ started dealing with you right right right that's it amen I've tried my best to explain it even in natural terminologies why do some of you sisters hold held yourself down through time when other sisters didn't but just remember that snake is your nature and your soul is your nature the nature of your soul is God if you're born again that's the dove but of not it's of the world souls in prison now think about it then the natural typ in the spiritual he uses those things to bring it out and we just got through where he says that the sanctification it cleanses the Mind sets the heart the mind of the heart in order of Holiness amen he goes out he gets Justified of his sins repent of his sins and things maybe he's a drunker he go right back to drinking and all those things oh we can hold ourselves right now I didn't I I why I did but I I couldn't stand thinking of drinking right I didn't do it that's just trueu I'd haul people boys in my car take them over because in those days we only had certain places you could buy a beer I'd haul them over and get them bring them where they wouldn't get caught cuz I was the driver and that days it didn't bother you if the driver was sober or didn't drink I'd bring them back and set them out and then I'd go do my thing they done their drinking they used to tell me said brother I tell you what said I got so drunk last night I didn't remember what I done I said well then don't give me nothing to drink cuz I want to remember what I done good or bad right I wanted to remember what I'd done if I got drunk and piced out and didn't know what I done then I don't know whether I done it or not right but listen when he get Sanctified that cleanses that desire out of him it takes the want of it away he can still be tempted but it takes the one of it it away still he's not right yet that's right y then he's got to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and brought into that situation all right yeah now we've covered we've covered this but I give it back to them and way to where they'll bring it up and where we can do it go ahead with number three same quote Richard he didn't know cuz I done told Brother uh Anderson what I was doing and Sunday I'll keep putting in the same quote just give it another number this is the number we just read them in it ago where he illustrates what here's a human heart and here's a human heart this one over here has a snake in it that's sin that's that lines that here he has his life that's that soul that whole entire being of that heart is his life right that's his soul okay here he has his life see that's his life this one over here has a dove in it what which is the holy spirit here he has a life what has it done it's changed that soul to a New Creation right right not your body and spirit well this one over here has malice hatred Envy that's what causes it is this fell here what the snake right well this one over here has love and joy and strong what does it down here now when you are asked or you are forgiven of your sins you only done this took out to sin taking that away but the thing that made you do it is still there that's the old root of evil it's still there notice then you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ forgiven of your sins all right now that old root of evil go ahead to number four which is Luke 11:24 it's also listed in Matthew when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places seeketh rest and findeth none he said I'll return unto my house which I came out whence I came out and when he cometh watch he findeth it swept and garnished y it's clean he finds it swept and garnished now he's talking about the soul right not your house right watch him then goeth he now I've got another one where it says that you know you remember the scripture where the the strong man of the house you remember that in the scripture the strong man of the house has to keep the house that's your soul that's not just houses and thing right then goeth he and taketh to him seven other Spirits more wicked now emphasize that more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there because we're going to say in a few minutes they going we're going to read brother Brandon where he says they're religious demons absolutely amen but what's a religious demon more wicked than this fell that's been here that has been a drunk an alcoholic a hormonger and all kind of thing all kind of things in his life but he's been forgiven he's been cleaned out of it he finds it swept and garnished then goeth he and taketh to him seven other Spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the life state of this man is worse than the first why because of what's happened how does that unclean Spirit how does that uh remember now the unclean spirit is the same thing as root of evil right okay everybody with me root of evil unclean Spirit same thing right all right now watch him look at number five questions and answers on the Holy Ghost 1959 he's talking about Martin Luther preaching justification Wesley preaching sanctification and he preached that a man after Justified is all see but you've got to be Sanctified cleansed look the root of evil taken out of you by the blood of Jesus Christ which is what faith in the blood not a chemistry Faith In The Blood now what now you can't expect the lutherans to preach sanctification now that ought to be enough to let you know that that we're talking about something a little deeper than what are natural thoughts but what did he say the old the root of evil taken out of you by the blood of Jesus Christ where sanctification look at the next one how can I overcome 1963 825 we notice when the unclean spirit is gone from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done Baptist Methodist those who believed in sanctification all right then Jesus said the unclean spirit that went out returns back to this church body and finds the house garnished swept clean living Pure Clean livs all right but then if that house isn't filled occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he was now watch what he called him a minute and the life stage of this place is set s times worse than it was when the first place they had to be better and listen they had they had been better to stay Lutheran than it would to be to receive that light and fail to walk so will the Pentecostals you know what I mean the house is garnished he takes it to the church now if you can't think about and old some of you are old enough to remember when people live good and done good right you know that brother around him I what I've always I love to read and I love to listen to what he said you know that the Baptist was made a denomination as far as natural man's concerned way back down below Methodist right okay and you know what brother R said the Baptist had just become a denomination that was in the 50s might have been in the early 60s what's he saying they let this thing come back in and they rejected it when he brought the truth now we're not throwing off on people you know better than that now so get all of it out of your mind erase it we're not throwing off on churches we're throwing off on me and you right but we're looking at it what he say about that and you know that's what happened you remember when you went to church I remember when we went to church that a woman didn't come to church without a hat on why cuz she believed in a covering we went to church and no women ever come to church wearing immoral clothing especially pants or anything right no I remember when they didn't cut their hair my mother put on one pair of pants a pants suit you know who bought it for my sister that was a her husband was a Baptist preacher so the only one out of the crowd of a Preacher the the my sister bought her a dress she put I mean a p of pants she put a suit thing she put it on one time and throw it away now come on we're old enough to think about these things we're enough to think about the ages and the times and the way people happen I've told you there at the old church in Gillsville where the the church was sitting here right behind the church was a cemetery and when we come to meetings the men would go one way into the woods the women would go the other way into the woods oh bless God I can't go down that little tick and than everywhere oh yeah they were sincere and you've seen a lot of things happen right right but then you seen them dropping away we went back to the church where we come from about what 10 years ago I guess maybe a little more something anyhow one of the one of Matthew's buddies or Zach one of Matthews I think Buddy become a preacher really love him a good little boy and we went down to hear him preach and now they was didn't even look like a church no right no I'm not throwing off on them now may I quote brother brand it' been better to stay of Lutheran than it would for you to try to move on so I'm not throwing off on those people right you understand me I'm not throwing off on them I'm saying they might be better off than we are that you don't like but it been better if you to stay a Lutheran instead of trying to move on but what is he saying those who believed in sanctification seven other Devils demons worse all right look at the next one now this is back before he comes to anointed ones I'm going to emphasize that this is back before brother Brandon Pro preached on anointed ones so you know he knowed a lot and watch him cuz what I just read you was 63 it's 64 or 65 anointed ones all right now look here he's back in 58 the unity of one God in the one Church the Bible said when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he walks in dry places seeking rest and then he comes back with seven other Devils more worse than he was and the LIC of state of that man is eight times worse than it was at the beginning listen that's what happens to these meetings when people go forth in revivals and men are just led to an intellectual concept he goes off and joins some church and lets it go at that satisfied that's all right there's nothing to all this other nonsense you know what he's saying what we say we should not have it the pastor says oh that's all that was very way back in another age and the first thing you know the devil returns back with seven other Devils watch him and he becomes a religious devil right now you can follow it easy to see in the old days like I said we'd be at church we had one man and I'm not joking I told you many times before he'd come to a Revival every time he come to Revival he come to the altar cried and repented and said he was got it now I've got it now he never made it till the next night I'm not joking now but the next Revival he's back in the altar repenting I got it this time never made it till the next night now I did hear later that he made it praise God I'm hoping so all right but my point is what he just come up so far and go back now it's easy to see that you used to drink smoke caral run around with women and you come to church and you repent of your sins sins and you you you repent and you you know you try to make things right we was in a Baptist Church and a man got up in the church and repented of his life before the church it's wonder they hadn't killed him you know why because he called the names of the women that were sitting in the church that he had been running around with you think he wouldn't sincere but he didn't make it you understand it's easy to think the demon comes back and you're seven times worse well this guy over here he was a pretty good guy he done pretty good but then he starts drinking he starts smoking he and you name seven things I wish you would I'll get it for you if you'd like it of the seven demons that was cast out of Mary Magdalene and not a one of them had anything to do with lust or anything of that order I'm talking about your Prophet said it was Pride boast this that or the other see we think it was these bad demons that's what I'm saying we think boy he laid his hand on her cast out them Devils them devil just come out of her and it was over here it went this way and over here it went religious religious demons then he's filled watch him and he becomes a religious devil then he's really filled then he's got pride and jealousy and and he's even angry with the very God that wrote the Bible he looks down there and says these things that I do shall you do that was for the disciples is that what people say religious demons unclean Spirit coming back is religious demons come on I emphasize it trying to we think it's them going back into the world of sin and the things they used to do and that's true but what about the others that come to church religious demons watch him go ahead to the next one which is number eight I think that's right we on yeah okay this is un un united under one head okay so you'll know the difference between it and that one while I go now what happens you can't stand neutral I'm going to hit this just a little bit and quit because I've got this too much to go and watch can't put it all in tonight now what happens you can't stand neutral okay would you pull up the drawing of number four pull up to number four drawing Brother Anderson sin's gone the unclean spirit is gone beautiful place to be but what if you don't go on and the demon comes back you go back into sin like I said about all you know most people go back into the sin they came out of go back to their drinking go back to their thing but others go to church and become religious demons amen now I don't want to draw it in there but it'd be something wouldn't it if that other one was a snake and this one and it had sin on our first drawing what would be seven times worse right in yours if you want to religious now you know that what I'm telling you is the truth I'm not throwing off on nobody out there come on but I'm telling you the God's honest truth you remember where you come from and the people that become religious the most hateful people you've ever seen right arrogant hateful people some of them was love and sweet but what's the biggest portion right you can't tell me I'm wrong I've been Justified sanctified the Holy Ghost you can't tell me I'm wrong you would put back everything that you started with back into that soul and add six times worse than what it was you're getting pretty close there to be devil possessed all right but I still say it's devil oppressed because he doesn't come and live in there like a devil he's back there as a nature a way now you know yourself that you've been around him in this message and I'm going to go ahead and say it so you just might as well get ready to get you see double married preachers in this message and they'll spend half of their time trying to prove it's okay for them to preach I ain't saying no more religious demons you calling don't and call nobody if you thought of that then you must have been thinking the same thing or at least wondering listen you st can't stand neutral go back to that one now number eight what happens you can't stand neutral you can't stay like that now you can repent and clean C out repent and clean out you may be able to stay at a certain spot but you'll never find a peace in your heart I see it I spent 10 years in a Baptist Church believing I was a born again believer a deacon teaching the adult Sunday School classes left there and come in this message two years in this message before I would ever confess that I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've heard me say it I've read six books and listened to two tapes in one day I was called a two-year Theologian by the people of this message I was talking one day about something and I said brother Brian said so and so this brother got right up in in front of me and everybody lambasted me good brother Bram never said it I just listened to that tape the other day and he didn't say that the next time we met I handed him the book and I said would you mind reading this right here I ain't de christianizing him cuz that was the state he was under that was the ministry he was under and he turned around and he said brother Dale you're right WR around and said it was he said I listen to that tape and I didn't hear that I'm not de christianizing nobody you think I am you think when I talk about ministers or doing this you know it's a God's honest truth but you know one thing for certain I love them people maybe I'm the one with a bad Spirit that's okay I don't have no problem cuz you see I have to deal with that you don't have to deal with it but look and what happens watch what he says that's the way it is with the true Born Again watch it experience of God man says there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost now he evidently ain't talking about truly born again because truly born again to believe in it right but he's emphasizing it right man says no such a thing as a baptism of the Holy Ghost it shows he hasn't got it now I didn't say it he trusts his Creeds he trust what God said listen we trust what God said he trust his Creeds We Trust what God Said Amen now what happened you can't stand neutral you got to be filled with something to survive notice you might be filled with one thing or another you say brother brandham I'm kind of on the fence no you're not that's right listen the Bible plainly says and all that was not sealed with the Holy Ghost receive the mark of the beast all that didn't have the Seal of God in their forehead had the mark of the beast you got one of it now on now may I quote brother random off of another and what did he say he said but you say brother random said we got the mark of the beast he said if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're already marked now come on folks we're not throwing off on nobody right but a man that die denies God's word and won't stand on his word how can you be saying he's got the Holy Ghost come on but you got to be filled with something watch him I'd like to test it just a little bit and see where we're standing I didn't finish that but around he emphasized you're either you don't have to wait for the mark of the beast you're already marked he said you're already marked with the mark of the beast that's where you're born at born with the mark of the beast oh bless God I ain't got the mark of the beast if you born again you got the mark of the beast amen there's one or the other so which one is it oh the mark of the beast remember is a religious Mark see we think about the mark of the beast is the big bad Devils the Big Bad drinking and all of the things right what do you call it a religious Mark certainly it is and you might be filled with religion you could have all kind of religion that doesn't save you at all you can just be a religious fanatic if you want to be touch not taste not handle not smell not that don't have one thing to do with the Holy Ghost roll it on up come on up you might be filled with a bunch of malice so he's taking both sides right you might be filled with a bunch of prejudice so full that you can't even sit and hear one sermon preached right mhm you might be filled with a lot of hatred you despise everybody that don't agree with you you might be filled with a lot of nonsense I'm glad you said that I didn't mean that I was it but you said I was you don't you despise everybody that don't agree with you if you think I don't know okay you might be filled with a lot of nonsense too you might be filled with a lot of author Godfree dirty jokes so much that you think too much so much of that you won't go to church on Wednesday night or something you might be filled with Elvis Presley's rock and roll that's true but you're filled with something and your own life Bears you record of what you're filled with by their fruits you shall know them you're filled with something you might be filled with a bunch of laziness just too lazy to do anything about it it ain't that something then we're going to stop right there cuz I got a lot more to go down but I will tell you one thing if you'll think about it see when you come to religious demons the next will be you come to anointed ones amen Anointed with a genuine Holy Spirit on your spirit that's why I said twoo much to go come on musician too much to go through theight but listen what is it the unclean Spirit goes out Jesus said sure he returns back to a lot of people and takes them out back right where they came from but that's not the person you got to worry about the person you got to worry about is the one he brings the church and sits in the pews with you but watch what I'm saying and then you think about it now I know I'm hateful but listen where has all of these things went now in the message it's took them 40 years to get run off the truth now they got their own website that started what what did it start with believe the vision or follow believe the sign that's what it started with a great internet system to believe brother Brandon was a prophet and everything just kept pouring it on then one day they started saying he wasn't a prophet and all that he done was wrong now you tell me that them unclean spirits ain't come back amen what would you do if you preached this message for 30 40 years and then turn you back on it right and go they won't do that in the Baptist Church right you understand what I mean they won't do it right but yet they've turned against brother R's message trying to prove he's wrong in every way listen folks I've always just been straight if I was a heathen and a total idiot and to the point that I didn't believe in God you know now listen I didn't believe in God at all I'd still want my kids to have an opportunity to think things over I would want my grandkids to think things over for themselves I'd want my great grandkids to think things over and to believe in God they would be no way I would ever you have been here with me long enough you know that I've always said it we're not preaching out there we're preaching right here now people are out there listening and call the internets and thing that's their business I ain't pastoring on no internet I'm not don't don't send me notes don't to know what I got to say I'll tell you the tape I preached it on but I will not answer your questions I've got them from preachers that wanted me to answer their question and I said no I will tell you the tape I preached on it if you want that if you're interested enough to find out you listen to the tape cuz I'm not not an internet Pastor I pastored this little group right here but I'm trying my best to save your soul and my soul and that's what I'm telling you we're going to all show what we are yep you got to be filled with something we're going to show what we are that's right period we're going to show what we are you just see the people of this message now already showing what they are but you know I like what the Bible says who was it said even if Christ is preached by contention said I Glory a glory for error because not Glory that there is error not that way now come on but by error being preached it'll make you study when they start Ed all of that back in the 70s of the two Souls it made me dig to find out what is a soul 40 years later I'm still talking about it amen there must needs be heresies among you that they that are approved may be made manifest that's Bible we don't glory in error we glory in truth cuz truth will expose the error in every one of us only thing I've ever ask God to do is let me stand and see you there whether I'm make it or not I dedicated my life years ago to this message and I don't have no secondary I don't have no place to go I don't have no Swiss bank account you you'd think of joking it way back a long time ago that the preachers in this message a lot of the big guys were sending money to a Swiss bank account why because Swiss bank account supposed to stay up when the rest of them fall I don't think so go we're all on the gold standard but it's truth right I don't have anything left over just in case this don't work I got everything anchored in this message let's stand you forgive me for being arrogant hateful and whatever and you place it to my ignorance and my part but you just remember what I'm trying to do you go back and you read what your Prophet had to say well I ain't got time to look you that's like a brother come here one time brother Mo was talking about stature of perfect man and the brother said how long did you preach on it he said either 62 or 72 messages he said I ain't got time to listen all them messages would you know what he had plenty of time to go on off into era and just believe anything he wanted to I got so tickle that brother mo one time only time I've ever seen him brother mo didn't say anything to anybody and and I'll illustrate it this brother he was right here preaching one I'm just talking about and he said brother brandham said that the fivefold ministry was folded up I can't roll this one piece and laid on the Shelf well you know what he was one of the fivefold Ministry well what didn't he shut up right you know if he's folded on the Shelf he's supposed to be up on the Shelf of course he didn't believe it that way right but he said brother randam said he folded it up let it on the sh brother M sit on his seat right here somewhere he said he didn't say it the brother looked at him he said well okay I'll just say myself to believe it that way you know you know hey I mean you're a five-fold Ministry and you're preaching that you've been laid on a shelf that that's more funnier than anything I can think of right cuz you do away with your own position right you're turn away with your own position to do it go ahead Brothers one we got 164 in the spir B 164 in the spiral book I'll let you through a little early so okay see far to car me think about it religious demons come on folks the devil was over the worship Kingdom which is the kingdom of the North in the Bible the Devil Himself the anointed cheriff when over worship don't you think he likes to go to church he ain't down at to beer joints The Honky ton tonight he's in church religious demons for car swing sweet how about it what

else coming for a car me home swing Judas is Garrett walked right up through there with the Lord Jesus and nobody knowed but the Lord Jesus who he was amen you know what I think he was doing pretty good because brother Brown said he went through justification sanctification now you have to argue with him about it so you mean that unclean Spirit yeah yeah I don't have enough time to finish Richard and I were talking the other day about this he said now if you either Faith or doubt and he said you come to clean it out he said what are you I said I don't know we'll have a lot to talk about when we get there but I do think one thing I believe Judas repented of his sins and he become Sanctified this is well let's AR rest of him because that's St John 17 same thing what's see you going to say well wasn't genuine you're going to have to argue with brother random because he said it was all right huh but what happened in that Upper Room did a big bad devil come down and or did you just open the door long enough for that old nature that old ways and that old being that love money and things amen walked right back into Judas and he went went out and sold the Lord Jesus right the unclean Spirit came back and he went out and sold him but listen folks I've never been too bad on Judas right because you think about Peter what was it about Peter when his the unclean Spirit was drove out of Peter Well Peter Peter denied the Lord and cursed in denying him right cursed it must have been that unclean Spirit but you see he went away crying in Repentance Judas did also but there was something wrong now may I say what R around said he said the problem with Judas he did not make it to Pentecost that's what he said see Peter made it I just hope you'll go home think about these things get the future home and just read it and read it and read it and see what he says like I said i' after all the years that I've been preaching from the future home I never seen that part that's in there that little sentence where he said and here he has a life then he brings it down to the Dove and he said and here he has a life why because it's him a soul is what you are that is your life you're being your person think on these things father we pray that you would just bless each and every one of us as we go our separate ways going home and may we Lord come to the place of realization that all of these things are dwelling upon us because Lord even as a prophet would bring it and the people would see why I don't have enough time tonight those demons that was turned loose on Israel to drive them to the Homeland those demons the prophet said has been turned loose upon the Bride of Jesus Christ to drive her to the message of the hour well look what it's doing Lord It's driving a lot away but it's driving some right to that word that they'll stand on it and it don't matter what we love you and we thank you be with the people on the way home forgive our sins take care of everything in Jesus name amen you're dismissed Jes Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of my heart Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all Jesus I surrender all
