[1:02] row but
[1:03] let's travel that's that yeah plus an
[1:06] hour and a half there an hour and a half
[1:07] back
[1:09] we actually hit a dog in this plastered
[1:11] that thing all over them
[1:13] i never woke up i never knew we'd even
[1:15] hit anything when we got home were you
[1:16] driving
[1:17] no not in jamaica
[1:21] i don't drive anywhere you were sleeping
[1:23] they drive on the wrong side of the road
[1:26] i'd have been driving way to hit more
[1:27] than a dog
[1:29] but um brother aaron was in the front
[1:31] and brother brad was with me and i was
[1:33] in the back and
[1:33] i think it was like the fifth or sixth
[1:35] night or fifth night
[1:37] man i was beat we got home with brother
[1:41] keith and they're all they all get out
[1:42] every one of them they're looking at the
[1:44] front of the car and what's
[1:45] why are you looking in front of the car
[1:47] he said you didn't feel it hit that they
[1:49] hammered a
[1:50] big old dog that didn't kill it
[1:53] there's a hammer i said no i just
[1:56] started with one of those bumps in the
[1:57] road in jamaica like they always are
[1:59] so just remember and that was
[2:03] oh six so that was about uh almost 10
[2:07] years ago so i'm 10 years older now so
[2:09] just
[2:10] start praying for me
[2:14] well i'm going to start actually with
[2:16] this is what i'm going to do so you can
[2:17] pray about it i'm going to start
[2:19] with poor knowledge
[2:24] predestination for knowledge and then do
[2:27] like
[2:27] what brother dale's been doing on the
[2:29] masterpiece family but i'm going to put
[2:30] it in the genesis 126 series that i've
[2:33] been doing
[2:34] so and then run us all the way to
[2:38] um revelations just watch service up
[2:42] there
[2:44] all right bob i won't do that um
[2:47] no signal bob
[3:14] how about on the other end
[3:23] all right let's turn anyway to second
[3:25] peter
[3:27] technology is not going to stop us
[3:36] that's all right if it doesn't happen
[3:39] we'll be all right i'll just turn it
[3:41] back on real quick
[3:44] that's okay it's got to be the uh
[3:47] the next one no the next one
[3:51] there we go let's go to dropbox and now
[3:54] we're right back where we started
[3:56] second peter one now what we're doing is
[3:58] for for our
[4:00] brother that's here now we've been
[4:02] through this is numb
[4:04] part 40 five
[4:07] so we've been since about december
[4:11] on the statue of repurpose before that
[4:13] wasn't it but october
[4:15] on a statue of a perfect man taking each
[4:19] virtue and showing it and applying it to
[4:22] our life and applying it in scripture
[4:24] and we saw that you must have the new
[4:26] birth
[4:28] before you can start receiving the
[4:31] virtues now
[4:34] the prophet of god said that you can
[4:37] have these virtues
[4:38] and not be born again but they're not
[4:40] godly virtues
[4:41] you've got you can be a virtuous person
[4:45] and not be born again but these these
[4:48] virtues that we're talking about for the
[4:50] past 45
[4:52] many sermons or sunday school classes
[4:54] have been
[4:56] godly virtues add to your faith
[5:00] so in other words as to what you have
[5:04] virtue add to what you have knowledge
[5:07] because
[5:08] peter james and john they had these
[5:11] virtues working in their life paul had
[5:13] these virtues working in their life
[5:15] because that was the faith of the
[5:16] fathers that was where jesus had tutored
[5:19] them for three and a half years then the
[5:20] holy ghost fell on the word that they
[5:22] held that's why you've got to hear the
[5:23] word
[5:25] you got to hear the word first you can't
[5:28] just get a revelation from nothing
[5:30] sorry you can't faith comes by hearing
[5:34] faith doesn't come by preaching faith
[5:36] comes by hearing
[5:37] you gotta hear from the five-fold
[5:40] ministry and that's what brother brown
[5:41] when he gets up to godliness we read a
[5:43] little bit last sunday but when he gets
[5:45] up to godliness
[5:46] he throws it right back to ephesians 4
[5:48] and 12.
[5:50] so that's the only way you're going to
[5:51] get godliness is you're going to have to
[5:53] hear
[5:53] evangelists pastors teachers prophets
[5:56] and apostles the fivefold minister
[5:58] there's no other way of getting it
[5:59] there's no one you don't receive the
[6:02] holy ghost just because it falls out of
[6:03] the sky
[6:05] the seed life comes through the body
[6:07] right right all right the seedlife comes
[6:09] through the body you got to hear the
[6:10] word first
[6:12] why didn't paul just get the holy ghost
[6:13] when jesus knocked him down on the
[6:15] master's road
[6:16] he didn't right he had to go see anna
[6:19] that's right
[6:20] which was the holy ghost-filled person
[6:22] right and had to receive the holy ghost
[6:24] by laying on the hands by him nice
[6:27] all right so i believe the same way with
[6:31] these virtues you can't just
[6:32] acquire these virtues it would be too
[6:35] easy to be able to just buy them and
[6:37] and be like you know something very easy
[6:41] to me these are victories as brother
[6:44] keith reed said these are trials of life
[6:47] right right because remember
[6:50] simon peter let's read here i'll show
[6:52] you right here
[6:54] simon peter servant apostle jesus christ
[6:56] to them that have
[6:57] obtained so you got to get it you're not
[7:02] born with it
[7:03] hello you're not born with it that's
[7:06] right right you're born with a
[7:07] representation that you're going to come
[7:08] to it
[7:09] but you're not born with it right if you
[7:11] were born with a new birth you wouldn't
[7:12] need a new birth
[7:14] all right so your first birth was wrong
[7:16] and you needed a new birth
[7:18] yes to be born again simon peter servant
[7:21] apostle jesus christ to them that have
[7:23] obtained
[7:24] obtained means go get something right
[7:26] you know the
[7:27] the um grocery store some of them do
[7:31] deliver but the grocery store doesn't
[7:32] just
[7:33] if you need some eggs they don't just
[7:34] bring you eggs you got to go get them so
[7:37] in other words you got to go get in your
[7:38] car
[7:38] so this is something that you've got to
[7:40] do you've got to obtain
[7:42] those that have obtained a lot of
[7:43] precious faith i was
[7:45] kind of thinking meditating the other
[7:47] day on how to
[7:48] approach a few things in in miami and
[7:51] and
[7:52] you don't want to be so bold but
[7:56] but the bible says that the kingdom of
[7:58] god is taken by force
[8:00] you can be meek and mild and humble if
[8:02] you want to i'm just not that way
[8:05] i'm like peter pull the sword first
[8:08] right
[8:10] then we'll talk about it later okay
[8:13] i'll cut your head off and then i'll
[8:15] pray for you put it back on and i'll
[8:16] pray for you
[8:18] but the kingdom of god the bible says is
[8:19] taken by foreign brother bob
[8:21] uh preach the sermon on it so it's not
[8:24] that
[8:25] i'm i am very leery of these preachers
[8:28] that walk around with this humble
[8:30] attitude and
[8:31] i just don't i don't get that
[8:34] right bible says the kingdom of god is
[8:37] taken by force
[8:40] remember what jesus told peter said
[8:41] peter put your sword up that's not the
[8:43] way it's done
[8:45] but that was a natural type of what the
[8:48] spiritual was going to be he knew peter
[8:50] was going to pull his sword
[8:52] on the day of pentecost peter pulled his
[8:54] sword but he wasn't the natural sword
[8:56] it was the sword of the word right all
[8:58] right so jesus was training them and
[9:00] teaching them
[9:02] that instead of using the natural force
[9:04] it's going to be
[9:05] by spiritual it's going to be a
[9:06] spiritual force and we must be confident
[9:09] because the bible says come boldly to
[9:11] the throne of grace
[9:12] paul paul gets up one day and he says
[9:14] you'll be judged by my gospel why can't
[9:16] we stand up and say that as ministers if
[9:18] we're preaching 100
[9:19] word of god why can't we stand up and
[9:20] say you're going to be judged by what i
[9:21] say today
[9:22] that's right amen right why aren't we
[9:24] coming to the place to where we can look
[9:26] at people in the eye and say you're not
[9:27] preaching what brother mountain's
[9:28] preaching
[9:29] right i'm glad they kicked that preacher
[9:31] out of that church a couple weeks ago
[9:33] yeah should have done it a year ago amen
[9:36] and you know nothing against the brother
[9:38] but if he's going to sit there and land
[9:39] back brother brown
[9:40] but he was wrong here and couldn't get
[9:41] it straight in here well then don't
[9:42] follow him come on
[9:44] then don't follow him out get out of the
[9:47] message just go do something different
[9:50] that's not true well if this message
[9:51] doesn't change our body then we need to
[9:53] find one that will because
[9:55] there's a there's a proof
[9:58] of the resurrection in
[10:02] what the prophet taught us so with the
[10:04] statue of a perfect man
[10:07] i believe it's one of the most
[10:08] ill-taught i said ill-talk
[10:10] subjects in the message they just said
[10:12] oh that's that's your perfect man you
[10:13] know you just gotta have this
[10:14] no you those are required these things
[10:16] are required
[10:18] brother brown said they're required yes
[10:20] they're required for a body change
[10:21] you're not going to take a body change
[10:22] as a baby
[10:23] that's right you're not going to take a
[10:25] body change it virtue right
[10:28] though you may have godly virtue the
[10:31] only way you're gonna take a body change
[10:32] is you see that little top
[10:33] up there that says love that little mini
[10:35] pyramid at the top
[10:37] that's gotta come to you in its pure
[10:39] form
[10:40] right and you can't jump up there and
[10:42] get it that's right
[10:44] twice took 50 years since the prophet
[10:46] left the scene for us to just
[10:47] now really realize what he preached
[10:51] i believe we just now are getting that's
[10:53] right the real essence of the message of
[10:55] the hour that's right
[10:57] back before it was hair and dress and
[10:58] living right and doing right
[11:00] and you know trying to trying to change
[11:02] it god sent a prophet and
[11:04] and the prophet's right well you know
[11:05] now they've come to where
[11:07] we've took the voice and i believe we
[11:11] as a church and as many other churches
[11:13] we are as the voice
[11:14] are the voice of that angel but now
[11:17] they're trying to tear the voice down
[11:19] after all these 50 years all right so
[11:21] you see that there's a mixed multitude
[11:23] just like there was in the
[11:24] when israel came out the mixed multitude
[11:27] was the one to give them the problems
[11:28] all right so the mixed multitude and the
[11:30] message
[11:31] is what's giving us the problem but here
[11:33] if we have obtained like precious faith
[11:36] let's read it
[11:37] with us through the righteousness of god
[11:39] our savior jesus christ
[11:40] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[11:42] through the knowledge of god and of
[11:44] jesus our lord so the only way you're
[11:45] going to get it
[11:46] is through the knowledge of the lord
[11:47] because paul says we must have the mind
[11:49] of christ it's like daddy was talking
[11:50] about last night in the bible
[11:51] in the bible bible study
[11:55] this message did not just turn us back
[11:59] to the day of pentecost with peter james
[12:02] and john
[12:04] this message takes us back in the mind
[12:06] of god before the foundation of the
[12:08] world
[12:10] because after eating this is fallen
[12:13] this is the permissive will of god but
[12:16] paul says we must have a mind of christ
[12:17] the mind of christ didn't fall
[12:19] exactly right that's why that genesis 1
[12:22] 26 man it's so important for us to see
[12:24] that that genesis 1 26 man never sinned
[12:26] right never did anything wrong never
[12:29] never had a bad thought never
[12:30] never disagreed with the word of god and
[12:33] when you connect with that
[12:36] see that brings that is the mind of god
[12:38] that's where the that's where this was
[12:39] developed
[12:40] it was developed in the mind of god
[12:43] brother i said let's go back in the back
[12:44] part of god's mind
[12:45] back part the intelligence let's go back
[12:47] paul says we must have the mind of
[12:48] christ
[12:49] what are they talking about they like
[12:53] to think like that's right well see our
[12:56] carnal thinking is what got us
[12:59] out of the garden that's right so our
[13:00] carnal thinking is not going to get us
[13:02] back in the garden
[13:03] right so we must jump over
[13:06] just for a better word jump over all
[13:08] that that happened in the garden
[13:10] we got to go back to that genesis 1 26
[13:13] man to where he is back in power again
[13:16] because that genesis 1 26 man is what
[13:18] controlled the world that's right
[13:19] before the fall right amen
[13:23] and we see a little bit of that now
[13:24] because each one of us like we're
[13:26] talking about last night um
[13:28] someone was praying sister susan was
[13:29] praying mom and dad was praying that
[13:31] this
[13:31] big storm that was going to have tuesday
[13:33] and wednesday it was going to come
[13:34] through 100
[13:35] chance of rain hail lightning storms
[13:39] we were going to have all kinds of stuff
[13:40] didn't touch us he didn't touch us we
[13:43] had a little wind and i said
[13:44] okay and it was your prayer and i
[13:46] believe until we get to the other
[13:48] side you're not going to really know
[13:49] that you're simple what's your simple
[13:50] little prayer change
[13:54] but your simple little prayer and you
[13:55] said a prayer and something didn't
[13:56] happen you said well
[13:58] that was choice or that was chance or no
[14:01] i don't believe in choice i believe in
[14:03] choice but i don't believe in chance
[14:04] right i believe in luck that's right i
[14:07] believe in love
[14:09] if you're a christian you're not lucky
[14:12] you're blessed you're part of the family
[14:15] and god's going to take care of his
[14:16] family members what a what a great god
[14:18] that takes care of his family like he
[14:19] does
[14:19] all right so i'll start preaching here
[14:21] in just a minute
[14:23] let's go back to this grace and peace be
[14:24] multiplied to you through the knowledge
[14:25] of god and jesus
[14:27] according as his defined his divine
[14:30] power
[14:32] hath given unto us so you take his
[14:35] divine power
[14:36] you give it unto us all things that
[14:39] pertain into what
[14:41] life that's your natural living and
[14:44] godliness now roman goblin is here that
[14:46] godliness
[14:47] is the same godliness as far as a uh
[14:50] definition but to me godliness covers
[14:54] all virtue knowledge temperance patience
[14:56] godliness brother
[14:57] that's all godliness because if it comes
[14:59] from god it's all godly
[15:00] all right because the word godliness is
[15:03] simply to be like god
[15:05] all right now according to his divine
[15:08] power have given
[15:09] us all things that pertain to life and
[15:11] godliness so we're talking about our
[15:12] life lessons and
[15:13] how to live like god
[15:16] through the knowledge of him and how
[15:18] we're going to get the knowledge
[15:19] if you got the new birth you got
[15:21] everything you need but you're going to
[15:22] have to hear the word
[15:23] from a preacher our teacher our brother
[15:26] our sister a sister
[15:31] all right to get this knowledge of god
[15:35] all right now we we know sisters don't
[15:37] preach but i'm going to tell you
[15:38] something
[15:39] brother brown said a holy ghost phil
[15:41] woman can help you that's right if
[15:43] you'll listen to him
[15:44] say we don't listen to him in the torped
[15:47] but
[15:50] they got to go up this statue just like
[15:52] we do it ain't just for the men
[15:54] there was women in that upper room and
[15:57] at 120 they were some sisters up there
[16:00] they came out with the same holy ghost
[16:01] of men have we don't believe in a female
[16:03] holy ghost and a male holy ghost that's
[16:05] right
[16:05] only one right
[16:09] one of those stinking doctrines we were
[16:12] talking about
[16:13] a male holy ghost and a female holy
[16:15] ghost anyway
[16:16] through the knowledge of him that has
[16:17] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[16:19] are given unto us exceeding great and
[16:21] precious promises so this is exceeding
[16:23] and great
[16:24] that by these you might be partakers of
[16:26] the divine nature
[16:28] right having escaped the corruption that
[16:30] is in the world through lust and besides
[16:32] this
[16:33] he has brought a dissertation of what
[16:36] you've got to have and all this all
[16:38] bringing it all the way down
[16:39] and he says beside this so in other
[16:42] words
[16:43] verse 1 through 4 is talking about your
[16:46] new birth
[16:48] that's your baby form new birth
[16:51] being born again as a baby
[16:54] nobody understand that say amen amen and
[16:57] besides this
[17:00] so it must be something you got to add
[17:01] too and besides this
[17:04] giving all diligence
[17:07] add to your faith virtue convert your
[17:09] knowledge knowledge temperance temper
[17:11] patience
[17:11] patience godliness godless brother kinds
[17:14] brother congress
[17:15] charity for if these things be in you
[17:17] and
[17:18] abound in other words they're going to
[17:19] overflow remember the dream
[17:22] sister shepard had about the pyramid the
[17:24] water was overflowing
[17:26] out of that pyramid and pushing trash
[17:30] out of what was the water brother brown
[17:33] said that was the holy ghost
[17:35] the holy ghost was getting the trash out
[17:36] yeah even after you're born again you
[17:38] still got trash
[17:40] hello you're not born again in your
[17:43] spirit i wish
[17:45] you're not born again in your flesh for
[17:46] sure that's right but you're born again
[17:48] in your soul and then you let your soul
[17:50] work out through the spirit into the
[17:52] spirit
[17:52] into the flesh all right but your flesh
[17:54] only does what the inside man tells them
[17:55] to be that's right
[17:56] for if these things be in you and abound
[17:59] they make you remember that word i said
[18:01] last sunday they make you in other words
[18:02] they're gonna it's gonna make you become
[18:04] a christian that's right
[18:05] all right they make you that you shall
[18:07] neither be barren nor unfruitful look at
[18:09] the promise
[18:11] you won't be barren or unfruitful in the
[18:13] knowledge
[18:14] of our lord jesus christ now that word
[18:16] godliness which is we're on now
[18:19] means holiness reverence respect
[18:23] piety towards god godliness
[18:26] now first timothy 3 says and without
[18:29] controversy
[18:31] great is the mystery of godliness
[18:35] great is the mystery of godliness
[18:40] god was manifest in the flesh of who
[18:43] jesus
[18:44] right justified in the spirit of jesus
[18:48] sin of angels jesus preached unto the
[18:52] gentiles
[18:53] jesus believed on in the world jesus
[18:57] received up in the glory now
[18:59] let's make it a little personal and
[19:02] without controversy great is the mystery
[19:03] of godliness
[19:05] god was manifested in
[19:23] if we don't see something personal then
[19:25] it just happened to jesus
[19:27] and that's denominational or what
[19:29] happened to jesus therefore i got it
[19:30] no that ain't it
[19:34] it's got to happen to you you got to put
[19:35] your name so if god was manifest in your
[19:37] flesh
[19:39] that's right and the word was made flesh
[19:42] that's right
[19:44] justified in your spirit this way
[19:48] scene of angels we all got one don't we
[19:50] don't we believe we got an angel
[19:52] brother we did we got an angel right
[19:55] don't you think the angels doesn't see
[19:57] us they're ministering spirits they're
[19:58] helping us get through this life we just
[20:00] don't see them
[20:01] right preaching to the gentiles
[20:04] absolutely what we're doing now
[20:08] believe not in the world and then when
[20:10] we take a body change we're received up
[20:12] in the glory
[20:13] actually in the soul you're already
[20:15] received up in the glory because you're
[20:16] sitting in heavenly places you've got to
[20:18] read the scriptures for that
[20:19] not as something over there this has got
[20:22] to be you
[20:23] if thou put the brethren in remembrance
[20:25] of these things
[20:27] thou shalt be a good minister of jesus
[20:28] christ
[20:30] nourished up in the words of faith and
[20:31] of good doctrine where unto thou has
[20:34] attained as that word attained again
[20:37] but refused profane and old wives fables
[20:40] and exercise thyself rather unto
[20:42] godliness
[20:43] so godliness is an exercise
[20:47] not bodily exercise exercise
[20:50] opening the book read the bible listen
[20:52] to tape
[20:54] all right for bodily exercise profit is
[20:56] little it does profit a little
[20:59] but godliness is profitable unto all
[21:01] things
[21:03] so when we get up here you know it's
[21:05] like i said before
[21:07] patience is something you got to deal
[21:08] with
[21:10] right temperance is something you got to
[21:12] deal with
[21:14] and when it comes to godliness godliness
[21:16] breaks out from you
[21:18] and the people got to see that they got
[21:20] to see that god's working in your life
[21:22] all right for bodily exercise prophet is
[21:24] little but godliness is profitable
[21:28] unto all things having promise of the
[21:30] life that now
[21:31] is well it's not just going to help us
[21:34] in the life hereafter
[21:37] it's promise of the life that now is and
[21:39] of that which is to come
[21:41] all right so it's going to carry you all
[21:42] the way through
[21:45] now look what paul sums it up and says
[21:48] this is a faithful saying
[21:49] and worthy of all acceptation in other
[21:52] words it's worthy of accepting this if
[21:54] you will accept it
[21:56] now look second timothy 3 5 we didn't
[21:58] get to but brother branham i looked up
[22:00] this morning
[22:02] there's 396 quotes that brother brown
[22:04] has
[22:05] the word godliness 396 396.
[22:09] about 390 of them he quotes the
[22:12] scripture right here
[22:15] having a form of godliness
[22:18] but denying the power thereof from such
[22:20] turn away
[22:22] you can't deny the power of god if you
[22:24] have it in you
[22:27] that's just one two one plus one is two
[22:30] right you can't you cannot
[22:34] say it's not powerful and have it in you
[22:38] so you you can have a form of godliness
[22:40] like brother burns said you can
[22:42] even paul said you can know all
[22:44] mysteries he said you can know the bible
[22:46] from front to back
[22:48] you can even live a good godly life but
[22:51] unless the power is behind that
[22:56] from such turn away in other words get
[22:59] away from it
[23:00] but 390 quotes brother brown quotes this
[23:03] scripture
[23:04] and he's talking about denominational
[23:07] people and people that have a form of
[23:08] godliness now we don't want to have
[23:10] that's not a form of godliness that is
[23:14] godliness a form of godliness is satan
[23:18] right a form of godliness is the devil
[23:21] the devil wants to be just like god he
[23:23] don't want to be a drunk or
[23:25] uh or or a prostitute or or
[23:28] any no he don't want to be that he he's
[23:30] here today he got here before you did
[23:34] if you'll admit it we probably brought
[23:36] him with us that's right
[23:39] because he plays on this playground
[23:40] right here
[23:42] the power of god is his word that's
[23:44] right
[23:45] it's the power of god and the salvation
[23:47] the word of god
[23:48] that's why we have to exercise
[23:52] so i said in timothy it's barely
[23:54] exercise prophecy little but godliness
[23:55] is profitable in all things
[23:58] but you can have a form of godliness all
[24:00] my brother brown said you can have the
[24:01] holy spirit
[24:02] on your spirit every day in your life
[24:04] and die and go to hell
[24:05] well what that does is it's an anointing
[24:09] that's what anointed ones at the end
[24:10] time are they're anointed
[24:12] by the true holy spirit balaam was
[24:14] anointed by the true god
[24:18] that's right right
[24:21] caiaphas was anointed by god that's why
[24:23] accomplished could feel things that's
[24:25] why typhus he was a high priest
[24:27] he was in that office but he yielded for
[24:30] fame and fortune and money and all that
[24:32] other stuff
[24:34] and had a form of godliness because he
[24:36] denied the power that was standing in
[24:38] front of him which was jesus christ
[24:39] and anytime you deny jesus christ
[24:41] there's one thing for sure you do not
[24:42] have the power in you
[24:44] not saying that you can't get born again
[24:47] but at that moment you're not
[24:50] a part of the family of god if you deny
[24:52] the power
[24:53] so that's why we come up to godliness
[24:58] and we'll uh we'll just read i want to
[25:00] read one down we didn't get to this
[25:02] let's read this one first is that you
[25:04] were perfect ma'am
[25:07] excuse me let's turn to ephesians four
[25:11] and find out i'm sorry i got my fonts
[25:14] too small but i
[25:16] i got to learn what font to use
[25:20] maybe that's a little better let's turn
[25:22] to ephesians 4 and find out over here
[25:24] what in the book of ephesians it says
[25:26] about this thing too
[25:27] about how we should do it ephesians the
[25:29] fourth chapter beginning with the
[25:31] twelfth verse ephesians four twelfth
[25:32] verse all right
[25:33] let's begin at the 11th verse and he
[25:34] gave some apostles some prophets
[25:36] remember last night
[25:38] don't try to take the other man's office
[25:40] that's what our problem is and the
[25:42] message
[25:43] we've got pastors evangelizing we've got
[25:45] evangelist pasteurizing
[25:49] that's exactly what it is pasteurizing
[25:54] we got apostles that want to go all over
[25:56] the country and
[25:57] and apostle the world but then they want
[25:59] to pastor a group of people so they can
[26:00] make money and don't have to work
[26:06] then you got teachers and evangelists
[26:08] and all the people like that so
[26:13] and brother brown fulfilled all five
[26:14] offices because he was a prophet he
[26:17] could do that
[26:18] this thing's loose he's a prophet he can
[26:21] do that
[26:23] he's not he wasn't a five-fold ministry
[26:24] prophet though
[26:26] right he was a prophet to the age
[26:29] he wasn't a part of that he was the fifo
[26:32] ministry for his time okay
[26:33] but he wasn't a prophet in the fifo
[26:35] ministry right
[26:37] he was a prophet to the age
[26:40] the church age right and he fulfilled
[26:43] all because remember
[26:43] the scripture says do the work of an
[26:45] evangelist he had to get the word out
[26:48] that's what he was sent here for to get
[26:50] the word out in the days of the voice of
[26:52] the seventh angel when he got the word
[26:54] out
[26:54] then you see all these places if you if
[26:57] you'll look
[26:59] even in
[27:02] look at the different places you went
[27:04] florida and look at the city
[27:06] in those cities there's messy churches
[27:07] now right
[27:09] lima ohio um of course jeffersonville's
[27:13] got three or four
[27:14] you got macon georgia he went there then
[27:17] you got
[27:17] florida you've got um louisiana
[27:21] rutherfordton north carolina if you'll
[27:23] look at some of the
[27:24] sermons he preached within ruth which is
[27:27] you know all right little rock all the
[27:29] way you'll see that's where he had to
[27:30] get the message out he had to get it out
[27:32] to the people so remember
[27:36] don't try to take the other man's office
[27:37] all right
[27:39] see some evangelists some pastors some
[27:42] teachers
[27:43] i'll read it and we can look at it later
[27:44] for the perfecting of god he said
[27:47] does that read like that congregation
[27:48] says no
[27:50] all right the perfection of what saints
[27:54] saints who are the saints the sanctified
[27:57] ones amen
[27:58] the ones that started from down here i
[28:00] believe he was talking about the pyramid
[28:02] down here
[28:03] all right perfecting of the saints for
[28:06] the working of the ministry
[28:07] ministry of jesus christ for the
[28:09] edifying of the body of christ
[28:11] for the edifying building it up edifying
[28:13] until till we all come to the unity of
[28:16] the faith
[28:17] and knowledge of the son of god and to
[28:20] the perfect man unto the assurance of
[28:22] life to the measure of the stature
[28:25] of the fullness of christ so that's what
[28:27] we're looking at
[28:28] is we're looking at now godliness
[28:35] let me see
[28:38] oh he says the song to be like jesus to
[28:40] be like jesus we seen it
[28:42] on earth i want to be like him now watch
[28:44] his watch his last statement when he
[28:45] sings this song
[28:47] that's godliness when he was smack smile
[28:50] on one side of the face he turned the
[28:51] other
[28:52] when he was spoken rough too he didn't
[28:54] speak he didn't ride back godly
[28:56] always looking for one thing all right
[28:59] so it brings it down to one point always
[29:00] look into one thing
[29:02] i always do that which pleases the
[29:04] father
[29:05] boy now how short are we
[29:09] jesus always please the father
[29:13] now that's our commission in godliness
[29:16] is to always please the father that's
[29:19] what it says i always do that which
[29:20] pleases father see yes sir always
[29:23] that's godliness to be about the
[29:26] father's business
[29:27] now i know we have life and stuff that
[29:29] we have to live and i don't want us
[29:30] to be uh in this church there's some
[29:34] that are
[29:34] real liberal and there's some that are
[29:36] real strict i think we're kind of in the
[29:38] middle
[29:39] i like to be in the middle of everything
[29:41] all right but if you're in the middle
[29:43] and you say well
[29:44] yes we believe in hair and dress but if
[29:45] you're not born again you're still going
[29:47] to wear pants you're going to slip
[29:48] around and do it
[29:49] if you're not born again you're going to
[29:51] cut your hair i don't care who you are
[29:54] because something's going to get on you
[29:55] and it's going to happen it's just the
[29:57] way it
[29:57] is but if you're born again you won't do
[30:00] those things right so get born again
[30:02] then you don't it's not that we put that
[30:04] away but paul says
[30:06] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[30:08] of christ
[30:09] right paul knew about the statue of a
[30:11] perfect man but he didn't know it like
[30:13] brother brown drew it on the chart and
[30:14] and all that but paul knew that peter
[30:16] said add to your faith virtue knowledge
[30:18] typically
[30:20] and all these things and he knew that
[30:23] and he said hey
[30:24] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[30:26] of christ listen i like milk
[30:28] i have a glass before i go to bed pretty
[30:29] much every night that's not all i have
[30:33] i like meat like i told benny you know
[30:37] benny's on that vegetarian diet thing
[30:39] you know
[30:40] there was a brother claude me and i were
[30:42] talking about he said
[30:43] he said there was a preacher one time
[30:44] was sitting in a in a uh
[30:47] airport and there was this lady scent
[30:49] beside him and they got to talk and she
[30:50] was a vegetarian
[30:52] and she got a call and said well now the
[30:54] lord says you know to eat the herbs of
[30:55] the field and the grass and all that
[30:57] stuff and all that you know
[30:59] and all that and said the preacher
[31:00] looked over and said well that's fine
[31:02] sister said but
[31:03] god gave me the wrong kind of teeth for
[31:04] that
[31:08] he gave me he gave me canines and
[31:11] incisors
[31:12] so i could eat meat with it so if god
[31:14] wanted me to be a vegetarian he gave me
[31:15] the wrong kind of teeth
[31:18] but see you can you can take that though
[31:20] and and
[31:21] this having a form of godliness you can
[31:23] make everything be a form you can say
[31:24] well if you do this or don't do that if
[31:26] you do that
[31:26] and we do believe in dudes and don't
[31:28] right right
[31:30] but if you're not born again you're
[31:31] going to do it anyway right
[31:33] so then you just look at that and you
[31:35] say well how are we going to
[31:37] know whether we go up the stack of a
[31:38] perfect man
[31:41] one gage to me and i fall short of it
[31:45] too
[31:45] from right here i don't read and study
[31:47] like i used to
[31:49] yeah because when i first started as a
[31:52] young christian i was reading three or
[31:54] four books a day like that because i'm
[31:55] about to read three or four books a day
[31:57] and i don't listen to tapes because i
[31:58] can't i'm just that way i can't
[32:00] concentrate on a tape
[32:02] i'd rather read a book i get more from a
[32:04] book i can't tape my
[32:06] mind wonders when there's a tape on but
[32:08] when i'm reading a book i have to read
[32:10] and concentrate
[32:11] but but that's okay you might can listen
[32:13] better and that see that doesn't make
[32:14] you wrong in me right or me right and
[32:16] you're wrong that's right
[32:17] it's how you can get it that's how god
[32:19] put it to you but you know what
[32:20] if you don't read more than you used to
[32:23] you got to be backslid yeah
[32:27] are you really never come to the
[32:28] fullness of god one of the two
[32:30] if you don't attend church more than you
[32:32] used to well the scripture says i'm not
[32:33] listen
[32:34] i'm not being mean about it the bible
[32:37] says
[32:37] more as the day approaches you go to
[32:39] church more so if you don't go to church
[32:40] more now than you did before
[32:42] you got a problem admit your problem
[32:47] much more the bible says as they
[32:49] approach it so we're
[32:50] some of us are going backwards
[32:54] it says much more well i got this hey i
[32:57] know we all got things we got to do
[33:00] and if somebody took a job and and you
[33:02] had to work two months and you was out
[33:03] of church
[33:04] so what but then the next two months you
[33:08] say well i got six more months of it and
[33:09] then i got another year of it and then i
[33:11] got well i got this is
[33:13] don't kick your ox in the ditch if your
[33:16] box gets in the ditch
[33:18] get it out that that's a brother that's
[33:20] what daddy always says he said now if
[33:22] yours gets in the ditch that's okay but
[33:24] if you kick him over in the ditch just
[33:25] so you can stay out of church to get him
[33:26] out
[33:27] you got a problem you buy you a brand
[33:30] new cadillac can't pay for it you got to
[33:32] work on sunday
[33:33] you got a problem if your job takes
[33:36] seven days
[33:38] you remember when one time i had to be
[33:39] out one sunday morning
[33:41] because of my job and that's because our
[33:42] plant manager was dying of cancer
[33:44] and i had to go in on sunday morning and
[33:47] about kill me but that was one time
[33:48] in 15 years
[33:52] that's one time in 15 years how about
[33:55] some of us
[33:57] did we used to go to church every
[33:58] wednesday every sunday and then now we
[34:00] just
[34:00] make it every once in a while on sunday
[34:02] and can't get back on sunday night
[34:04] get full on sunday morning i guess and
[34:06] then wednesday night's hard i know that
[34:08] a lot of you live a far away and that's
[34:10] that's why we got the internet that's
[34:12] why we've got the live streaming but
[34:14] don't use that as a crutch and how many
[34:17] of you are really looking at the live
[34:19] streaming when you are at home
[34:21] oh we know you can tell yeah while i'm
[34:23] meddling again all right let's go
[34:25] but listen when we come to godliness we
[34:27] got these points have got to be look how
[34:29] it's going
[34:30] look how that pyramid is shaping up it's
[34:32] getting narrower and narrower so what's
[34:34] got to happen is we gotta fit inside
[34:36] that narrow gap
[34:39] it's not way down here in phase where we
[34:41] can got a little wiggle room and a
[34:42] little movement
[34:48] yes a lot of people got faith but then a
[34:51] lot of people got gobbling
[34:53] and definitely brotherly kindness i told
[34:54] you brother kindness is gonna be rough
[35:08] did you say while ago that the flesh
[35:09] only does what the soul tells you
[35:13] your flesh only does what the inside
[35:15] tells you do you flash there's nothing
[35:16] more than
[35:17] still fine this would never be perfect i
[35:20] mean
[35:20] but it will be perfect for what's inside
[35:24] it will be perfect for what's inside
[35:26] from what's inside
[35:28] your flesh is seed taste fill smell in
[35:30] here that has nothing to do
[35:32] with the holy ghost right so that was my
[35:35] question
[35:36] your body is contrary but god give us
[35:38] those five senses to contact this world
[35:40] we're going to keep those five senses
[35:42] listen when brother i went across the
[35:43] curtain of time
[35:44] they still had their five senses and
[35:46] they weren't even in flesh bodies
[35:48] right so you're going to keep your seed
[35:50] taste filled smelling here but it's
[35:52] going to be
[35:53] all of our seed tasteful smelling hair
[35:55] is contrary to god
[35:57] in the state it is now right but you're
[36:00] never going to lose that
[36:02] but if you take the spirit out of this
[36:04] man take the soul out of this man
[36:06] that body can lay there for 100 years
[36:09] and it'll never do anything wrong you
[36:12] got it now
[36:12] yeah the body without the fly i mean the
[36:15] the body without this
[36:16] soul is dead you just lay in there
[36:20] there's nothing to it that's why you can
[36:22] knock people in the head and you can you
[36:24] can they can go into comas well they
[36:26] still got their soul but their body
[36:27] can't work
[36:28] and look at the elderly people
[36:32] when as you get older your body doesn't
[36:33] work your mind doesn't work you know
[36:35] brother brown said you can go crazy and
[36:37] still have the holy ghost why because
[36:38] it's this thing
[36:40] this thing this spirit inside of you
[36:42] it's not the soul
[36:44] i look at brother tatum and sister tatum
[36:45] and a good example of a
[36:47] godly man and god the woman we all
[36:48] believe that amen
[36:50] but here they are they had to be put in
[36:52] a nursing home and you know
[36:54] they would you know they get mad at each
[36:56] other or you know but to me that
[36:58] god don't see that but we're so
[37:01] encapsulated in this oh nasty flesh
[37:05] till that's what in our spirit which is
[37:08] memory reason conscious affection
[37:09] imagination
[37:11] now that can be used of god or it can be
[37:13] used with the devil
[37:15] but see in your flesh as your flesh gets
[37:18] weaker
[37:19] things happen more you you brother
[37:21] ramsay you can go crazy
[37:23] and still have the holy ghost okay you
[37:26] can still go crazy and still have a holy
[37:27] ghost okay so that doesn't include that
[37:29] doesn't do anything with the inside god
[37:31] what happened is we're so much in this
[37:32] sin cursed world
[37:35] that this is cursed so as it gets older
[37:37] the curse stays on this
[37:39] that's why somebody's going to take a
[37:40] body change it's got to come from within
[37:42] it can't be what mom and daddy brought
[37:43] you it's got to be what's inside works
[37:45] its way out and
[37:46] changes this thing that's why your chain
[37:49] starts at the new birth
[37:50] right because it makes this body that
[37:52] used to hold the beer in its hand
[37:54] now hold the bible same hand
[37:58] same mouth that i used to say bad words
[38:00] i used to curse people
[38:02] now i hope to god that it helps people
[38:04] you understand it's the same amount
[38:06] right but it's the motivation that's
[38:08] inside that brings it out okay all right
[38:24] you
