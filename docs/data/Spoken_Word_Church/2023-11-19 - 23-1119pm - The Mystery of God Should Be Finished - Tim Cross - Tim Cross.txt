um and I know that I've probably saying this a billion times but um I personally feel like this song is almost like my personal testimony um because anytime I feel like my faith is really low or like I'm kind of stuck in a pit and I don't think I'm going to get out um This song reminds me that God tells me that if he can um if he can walk on the water when he was on Earth and speaking to the wind and it and it hushes and it obeys him then there isn't much you know anything too big that I that I can ask him that he won't be able to do um and just to share share a quick verse with you at the end of John 21 um it says that there's so many so many other things that Jesus did when he was on Earth that if each one were written down the world itself couldn't contain the books that that would have to be written so what's a what's a small request from us when our faith is low so I hope this song is a blessing to you like it is for me see now I need a [Laughter] [Music] second as I kneel in the darkness in the midle of the night I'm praying for Assurance that everything's going to be all right and Lord I see another battle and it's out in front of me I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go

word um this evening if you'd like to open your Bibles to Acts chapter 26 I believe we'll just um try to carry the thought from this morning going a little farther this evening and um pray the Lord will bless it and um just Quicken it to us and you know it it does take him breaking the bread of life to our hearts amen we can't um impart anything it takes the Lord to to do it for us but we I believe we come hungering and thirsting he'll sure he'll sure feed our souls amen so we just enjoy our time here I really am sorry my wife couldn't come with me and our little daughter but um Lord willing next time they'll be able to come along and she goes get a little better about those longer trips which is not that long it's only 3 three and 1 half hours used to be she get 4 hours would be the very most she could take but she getting a little better so um we just um look forward we really look forward to the day we'll never have to part again amen I believe it's it's right on us now so we thank the Lord for it maybe just before we read his word let's go to him once more in prayer Lord Jesus we just thank you Father for the the opportunity we have to gather again this even evening around your word and we do pray father you'll come and anointed Lord uh just now may our hearts be open to receive and may you come Lord and Minister I have Lord something on my heart but Lord it'll take you to guided and directed and you know every person every need and you know how to speak to that father so we pray that you will and we just ask you to minister in our midst this evening and be glorified and honored in and all that is said and done we ask it in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen let's read Acts chapter 26 and beginning at verse number six I actually need to find it myself here acts 6 uh excuse me Acts 26 beginning verse 6 and Paul I I re I realized looking through acts this afternoon there's three different accounts of Paul's conversion and this was probably the last time he shared it before King Agrippa and he he was saying here he said and now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God un to our fathers unto which promise our 12 tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to come for which Hope's sake King Agrippa I am accused of the Jews why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God God should raise the dead I verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth which thing I also did in Jerusalem and many of the Saints did I shut up in prison having received Authority from the chief priest and when they were put to death I gave my voice against them and I punished them of in every synagogue and compel them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them I pers cuted them even unto strange cities whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priest at midday O King I saw in the way a light from above above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were all Fallen to the earth I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul Saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and I said who art thou Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and stand upon thy feet I remember there was an angel that met Daniel that changed his position amen amen and here is someone meeting Saul and striking him to the ground but then changing his position position again but rise stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of both of these things which thou Hast seen and of the things in the which I will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom I unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins uh among forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon oh King agria I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but showed first unto them of Damascus and Jerusalem throughout all the coast of Judea and then to to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God and do Works meet for repentance for these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me having therefore obtained help of God I continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and Christ did say should come that Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles it's a lengthy reading but you can be seated this evening I want to I want to continue on the prevailing power of Revelation but I want to title uh tonight's message that uh the mystery of God should be finished remember uh Revelation is me is is it's from the Greek word apocalypse which which is the unveiling or is the revealing of something that was previously a mystery amen and so um I want to just go right in because I've got a number of things uh and I I read paraphrase this quote this morning but um the prophet of God says this or this is from the church ages book he says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he know knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she uh excuse me what I lost my place here what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army Satan knows this that's why he's trying so hard to block it but he can't amen if they get a revelation of the two Spirits with in the framework of the Christian Church you see that's that's the thing we're realizing it's not so much out there it's even here and it's trying to come in here right it's just trying to it's trying to uh to compromise each of us as individuals who make up that church by if they get a revelation of the two spirits and by God's spirit discer and with understand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before he will be as definitely thwarted today day as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives you see it's not in our heads in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen now I was looking for I had um I had had the word immutable here um where was I seeing that we know God is immutable and it seemed like there was uh something here I was catching out of what brother bam said immutable so we let's just look because I looked up the definition of that i' never looked at it before it said immutable means not capable of or susceptible to change right amen and I thought brother boy I thought that's pretty good God is not capable of changing right nor is he susceptible to change now we live in a world that is constantly changing we live in circumstances and conditions that are constantly changing but God never changes right his word never changes so no matter what happens with the opposition or the adversary Amen to the word of God it doesn't change him at all because he is uh he is incapable of changing and he's not susceptible to any change amen so that shows you amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and so he built his church on an unmovable an unshakable Foundation amen and his church carries the same characteristics as himself amen they are omnipotent amen they are invincible because they are the reflection of his characteristics amen so when you when when that uh when that really anchors in your heart amen it will give us confidence in who we are and how he has placed us amen here at a part of his church or his Earthly body amen manifesting himself and so that's what that's what that's why I read you these scriptures here out of Acts 26 because Paul was simply trying to do God a service without it being his will and then one day he met the person of the Old Testament letter he he met the person of the word Christ in the form of the pillar of fire and then he realized what he had been persecuting was actually Christ's body here here on the earth and as I told you this morning Revelation doesn't just show you something it actually brings you into that very thing amen and incorporates you into it as a living part of it you've heard the expression if you can't beat them join them well that's what happened with Saul he was trying to beat the church and then he ended up just being brought right right into it amen and sent to the church and even the the the Apostle Peter had to acknowledge that Paul had the Revelation amen of the word of God and of the person of Christ the resurrected Christ amen which is actually what the preaching of a resurrected Christ is what brought Paul to a crucifixion himself preaching a living resurrected Christ present tense amen not even a historical figure that's what got Paul killed amen but it was a revelation to him and so it it couldn't be could not be extinguished so uh I want to again I kind of had to cut off just for the sake of time this morning but I was showing you how John saw his name in the Lamb's Book of Life there in Revelations chapter 5 and he realized when the lamb prevailed I prevailed he saw himself there represented in that lamb in that sacrifice and so it changed his worship even he went from weeping to worshiping everything in the earth in the heavens and everything beneath the Earth in the sea and all that was there in heard John rejoicing amen when he saw his name the prophet of God shares it in the seals John saw his name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that Revelation amen enabled John to go back write the Book of Revelations and then live out the rest of his life as an overcomer as as a as a Victor there in the Ephesian age so but but that book is mentioned again a little later in the Book of Revelation and it has a great meaning to you and I here in the last of the ages amen you believe we're living in the last of the ages today amen so this this book amen has was was mentioned in Revelations 5 but it's picked up again in Revelations chapter 10 and again I know you are believers of the message and I'm I'm not reading you scriptures that you're not familiar with but I I I I just want to I'm hoping the Lord will help uh just anchor this in your heart and and illuminate it maybe in a even even greater way so he says here I'm reading from Revelations chap 10 beginning at verse number one he says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open see there's the book again this is the same book that John saw in Revelations chap 5 closed waiting for one who was worthy to come and open the book now there was only one worthy and it was not John and it was no no mortal man but it was Christ himself he proceeded forth from the Throne of God as the Lamb of God God the king amen God the Father became the son or became the sacrifice became the lamb to to satisfy his own requirements for Redemption he became a kinsman redeemer God condescended became a blood cell in the womb of the Virgin Mary amen and was birthed here unto the Virgin Mary amen and was birthed here unto the Earth Amen to take Upon Us himself the sins of the world Amen and and and to to uh to redeem you and I from the fall from everything to undo the second Adam undid everything the first Adam did yes sir brother and sister everything that was forfeited there in Eden was restored by the second Adam amen uh right right after the garden of gsan so in the Garden of Eden it was lost in the Garden of Gethsemane he said not my will but thine be done and that brother said he was prevailing in Gethsemane he was prevailing on Calvary but that was the result of Gethsemane amen he was wrestling with even his own will as a mortal man not wanting to have to go to the cross and suffer and endure that but the will the Revelation prevailed his purpose prevailed the Reason God had sent him to the Earth the Reason God came to the Earth that Revelation prevailed it's beautiful I I I just I see I see it in so many things you see so here this now this book John saw it the lamb proceed forth in Revelation 5 take the book open it and they they it immediately changed their worship but then they they worshiped him as their redeemer and they were Kings and Priests they saw their position amen and um and and thou Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and Nation so here it we're picking it up now and in Revelation chap 10 and this is part of the opening of the seals this is in the sequence or order of the seals being revealed amen and so he uh he's here verse uh verse two of chapter 10 and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared now remember this is Christ right it it it's it can only be Christ because only he can open the book amen but there's something happening here there there's a if you will there's a transition of the book or there the book amen is is changing places in a sense he cried with a loud voice as went a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write as John speaking I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not this was on patmas 2,000 years ago John heard what was uttered but he was forbidden to write it because it was to be sealed for an appointed time amen I want to say this tonight with divine revelation comes a divinely appointed timing for the Revelation to be made known amen I was disc discussing this with a brother over lunch you can see a truth something can be revealed to you and you want so badly to show it to someone else but there's a divinely appointed time for that and your faith in the truth has to be there and hold consistant until God does if it's a lost loved one if it's a child if it's a parent doesn't matter amen you hold your faith right there believing until God's timing clicks into place and he does what you're believing for and don't you stop believing don't you stop praying your prayer may help what is going on in the Supernatural that is blocking that from taking place may help that Prevail amen you hold your faith steadfast and believe it until God opens the understanding Amen in the eyes of of of the other you see amen there and and see that knowing that will give you faith and will rest you you're not all upset about what's going on in the interim you're believing to an end you are believing to a result and you're not going to stop believing amen until you see it take place and you may go by the way of the Grave looking for that believing but God will perform according to your faith amen absolutely so never give up believing never give up believing amen praise God Lord help me to stay stay on track here so something was was uttered John heard it but it was sealed up um I can read verses five and six the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer now um I I want to read this and you got a good pastor here if I say anything wrong he'll uh he'll get it straightened out I'm sure of that but I I want to I want to read this out of another version of the Bible and I saw this many many years ago and you remember we used to carry uh back in the before the digital age we have the little blue Greek diglot if you some of you remember the Greek diaglot if you look at this in the Greek diaglot it phrases this just a little differently than it is phrased in the King James version but it is not a departure or a deviation from the actual context right it's actually showing you what is meant by this phrase that time should be that there should be time no longer here's what the Amplified says and swore an oath by the name of him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the Sea and the things in it that there will be delay no longer right or that time should be delayed no more amen that's right now you remember the brother Bram when he taught on the seals he said that seventh Angel's message is to tie up those loose ends or think things that were held in reserve until the seventh Angel's message things that had Luther stayed with the Revelation to follow the pillar of fire he'd have worked right into it he'd have come right into it but he was cut off his life ended the the the the the the age ended but the Revelation progressed right there were things that were not revealed brother bam I'm paraphrasing it or putting into my own words but they were true truths that were too precious to be revealed prematurely because what did he say in the seal Satan would have done great damage had he seen this or had this been released prematurely but now in the time of the seventh Angel's message the time of the revealing should be delayed no more amen that's right there is a divinely appointed time for Revelation to proceed amen to produce a certain result a reaction or a product amen that is the actual Revelation itself manifesting oh brother and sister I hope you don't think I'm out on the lib because I'm not right but there are things that God has held and has masked that's right he's he's taught it in Parable he's given it in Shadow he's given it in typ of the r said the Rapture is typed all throughout the scriptures but it's a mystery amen it's it's it's it's it's held there for a divinely appointed time and one day it'll be quickened or it'll be released and then we'll we'll just vanish from from no one will even know what's happened we just have been called away in a moment in the twinkling of an eye amen so that there will be delay no longer now you understand I'm not trying to change the scripture but we think here you know if you just read this that time should be no more well hey time ends time stops there's no more time we go into eternity and all this happens at the same with angel's Ministry well you you've got to see that in a in a in a better context understand time is still going on but the time of this being delayed or this the time of this being held in the mystery form that time has come to an end amen right in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished that's my title tonight the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets you say brother Tim what mystery the mystery that opened when the Roman thrust his spear into to his side amen there was a mystery that was released just as Adam had a mystery released from his side in Eden and the Mystery was the feminine expression of himself the mystery was him in a her wow it's exactly right her name was Mrs Adam that's and did not become Eve until she fell in the transgression she had his name his identification his life but she had long hair she had the she was the feminine expression of him birthed here or or formed into a body to continue his life to be the beding by which his life could be reproduced here in the earth that is the bride she is the mystery of Christ revealed and that's what Paul met he met the form he met the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire said I am incarnated in this church in this people and in this body and it brought Paul into the mystery and then Paul begin to preach the mystery and say you know what these are Gentiles but they're saved by faith they're saved the gospel has opened now it's not restricted to Jews it's not restricted to uh to Hebrews it's not restricted to a bloodline or a lineage it's actually the faith of God Amen revealed now and it and again it tore down all those barriers and I don't have a lot of time to expound on it but you understand amen it was the mystery of God then at the church being revealed in its infancy from Pentecost in the Ephesian age down through the successive ages amen the church was being formed here through each age and a messenger would be sent with a message that would call the believer to their position and their placing in that portion or that segment of the Body for that period of time and you did not get into that body without hearing that messag you did not become incorporated into that or be birthed into that apart from the word of God which was an entrance the word of God is an entrance for you believing that word to be placed and positioned in the body of Jesus Christ and in each age he had a messenger which was a Vindicated messenger with a message to call a people of that age then they would be sealed away under that messenger's message and in the next AG would come and others oh my I I feel good here the mystery of God should be finished brought to completion the Bride made whole the last member brought in under the seventh Angel's message and when the last one comes in the book will be closed the gospel will turn back to the 144,000 the bride will be raptured the two prophets will go and and then we'll go into the the marriage supper and then return for a millennial Reign that's exactly right oh my the mystery of God should be finished and uh again this is is kind of tying into the the prevailing revelation see and it you can see it brings when truth is presented when truth is preached it starts a war when a trumpet sounds it starts a war so when when the ministry came to this earth in the seventh Angel's messenger it started a great stir oh yeah amen but it has produced a bride it has produced a a a a people the the body of Jesus Christ so um I want to move to uh brother if you got it there quote uh just called it quoted quote number two questions and answers on the seals here's the question is it true that every Jew born since Christ that came into the world is to be saved no nothing will be saved only those names which those names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Jew or Gentile see that's it the book holds that mystery and I want you to see I'm just caught some things in here today that I had never stood out so vividly to me before the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names amen you see names are still being called didn't end when the prophet left the scene didn't end when the last message was preached in 1965 those names are still being called amen John had been filled with the Holy Ghost but then years later saw his name in the book amen and so brother bam says I and I just I wish I could remember now the message but if there is a a a gospel the go brother B said the preaching of the Gospel is the sounding of the Jubilee trumpet and so as long as the gospel is being preached and as long as there's a someone to respond Amen to that there's still Mercy there's still Grace if you're Desiring mercy and Grace there's more to be had the names are still being called but the book is now being revealed under the ministry and the message message of the seventh angel messenger amen and we're close to the end the last name could be called tonight the last one could be birthed into the body tonight I mean tomorrow we could be at the Merit supper of the lamb before tomorrow it wouldn't be too soon amen it could happen in the next few minutes amen but you you you see what's being here what he says here all right the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what The Mystery of the book is I I just say this tonight any Ministry that turns the revelation of the word back into a mystery doesn't come from God right amen amen we are living in the hour when the Mysteries are have been revealed any Ministry that takes the Simplicity of the word as preached To Us by God's Prophet it he made it pretty simple if they make it complex and mysterious again I'd run from it if I were you that's right I really would because it it's it's simple God hides himself in Simplicity and reveals himself in the same all right you you understand that now see paragraph 115 the book doesn't say now Lil is to be saved in this time of this church age or Orman Neville or whoever know it don't say that it just shows the mystery unfolds the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it amen see remember Jesus prayed for Peter that his faith fail not see Faith reaches out and latches onto the revealed word of the hour and draws it into the OR draws the person into it is that right someone said well there's no need needed me trying it brother brandham there's only one to be saved out of Jeffersonville see now see it's showing a parable that isn't it there might be thousands saved I don't know I hope every one of them is saved but I don't know but here is the way I want to believe it I'm that one amen see that's Faith here's the way I want to believe it I'm that one you believe the same for you if you don't then there's something wrong with your faith and you don't know what you're doing amen um I don't want to get too scattered here but again the Jubilee trumpet only had an appeal to an Israelite come on when that trumpet sounded there was all kinds of Nations and peoples and walk walks of life and you know they just heard a trumpet blow mean anything to them but to a Jew to an Israelite to a Hebrew he was listening for that trumpet because that trumpet opened up to him a law that enabl him to walk back to the Homeland be restored to his inheritance and his possession regardless of what anybody else thought about it or said about it that's what the message is to you and I is our Jubilee trumpet so it captures our attention amen he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit you didn't hear at Kentucky with the a school grade education you heard Christ you heard your name being called from the Lamb's Book of Life amen and you responded to that amen amen and that that that is uh that is Invincible oh my so I want to show you again I I feel like I'm kind of kind of in a teaching mode here but it's pretty good amen so this book here now in Revelation it's actually coming to the Earth but it's coming us through a certain Channel yes right me find it here the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice now this is John speaking The Voice which I heard heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth so now it's time for John who represented us Amen to go and take this book right but I want to I want to interject this in here from 1963 the breach between the seven Church ages and the SE seals paragraph 299 talk about a jubilee talk about a time when that lamb walked forth see the book is even sealed in heaven the Mysteries are and you say is my name there I don't know I hope it is but if it was it was put on the book before the foundation of the world but the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world and he took the book opened the book and tore off the seals see the seals is what bound the mystery the seals is what held something there it's almost like a uh you know if you've ever seen something with a great power a great potential it has to be bound by something to to to hold it until it's released right he opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to the seventh angel to the seventh angel to reveal it to the people that's God's divine order surely the Lord will do nothing until he reveals it first to his his secrets to his servants the prophets so the seals only Christ could open them only Christ could reveal them but here on the earth in the seventhe age you have a prophet and you have the revealing of the son of man Christ operating in a prophetic office to reveal his word and to call his subjects yes to call his bride to call his church and to stand there and say come out of her my people sayeth the Lord and be ye not partakers of her sin be ye not identified you see you've got to lose that identity and gain his identity remember I told you this morning the same level of worthiness it took to open the book was required to look on it so for you to see your name on the Lamb's Book of Life means he has brought you he has elevated you to his level of worthiness absolutely that's absolutely right he has Justified you he has Sanctified you with his own blood he has removed anything that was attached to you to to to uh to defile you and he has lifted you up to see it shows you have been brought into the same level of worthiness as himself amen amen praise the lord the devil can't do nothing with you right but he sent it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people there you are oh my what happened the screams the shouts that the Hallelujah the power the anointed the power the glory the manifestation if you ever hear this on the tape when brother B was preaching this in the breach that place was coming unglued oh yeah cuz they realized this is happening now the revelation of what has for thousands of years been a mystery is now being broken it's being released right here right now through those channels amen and and it's and and friends there was a day when it was released to me there was a it wasn't in ' 63 when I saw it but many years later Sister June and I heard my name called from that book and it became Quicken and real to me amen and I got the same Jubilee I had the same Pentecost amen oh my it's wonderful and and it will Happ you say but Tim this is all Greek to me well just hang on Amen there's a divinely appointed time just stay in that atmosphere stay in that environment stay under the preaching of the word keep seeking in prayer and fasting God will break it open one day brother and sister and then there'll be nothing the devil you he he he won't have enough demons in hell to stop youen amen okay so let me uh let me see if I can move along here oh yes well I just wanted to show and and I thought I'd say this too you know you get into some of these areas and people oh oh oh they get real uptight oh oh oh know there was a time but that's that's that's what the you know and I'm just use a few labels here that's oh that's what the Peruan movement or that's what the Thunders movement or that friends those are scarecrows amen those are scarecrows but have you ever seen a a farmer put a scarecrow on on a on a dung pile no no puts a scarecrow where the fattest strawberries are to an experienced bird the Scarecrow was the place to go yeah not there to eat the Scarecrow I'm there to eat the strawberries that the Scarecrow is trying to scare me away from so all of these things that have been taught down through the years and yes there may have been imbalance and there was uh there was you know a lot of times those movements were more about their leaders than they were about the actual message but that should not make a you know the brother M said the Catholics don't have the option on the cross just because they use a cross as their symbol doesn't mean we should quit having crosses amen see past the scarecro and realize there's a truth there that is so powerful that's why the devil did what he did with it to try to scare you away from it but it's yours it's your message it's your truth amen and when you digest it it'll produ it the very life of the message in you amen so I want I just say that say don't don't worry about the scarecrows and I and I I for sure am not here to try to point you to me or some Ministry I'm trying to bring you into not at all amen I'm I'm hoping you see Christ and him lifted up and glorified through the revealed word of the hour Amen in another place brother R says the bridegroom call will come right through this message you see in another place he says it's the that's that's the king calling for his Queen to come stand by his side oh you you're well taught here he's uh he's dealing in the first seal with the um when the the gospel goes back to the 144,000 and he'll say oh I got them in the house of my friends see one then they'll realize that they have killed the Messiah but what will he say the same as Joseph did you did it to serve life uh or save life don't be angry with yourself because that the Gentiles would not have been brought in if the Jews hadn't done that blindfolded trick so he saved the life of the church by the things that they done so there you are and that's the reason they can't understand this it isn't the hour that's something to think about 144,000 are gathering right there in Israel when God's Prophet was here on the Earth but it wasn't time there's a divinely appointed time verse two or paragraph 258 no more we could understand these things until the time comes for it to be understood oh my the seven thunders of Revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for the great translation Faith amen I I uh I know I sound like a broken record but in the little illustration Brother Brad him gave of the the armor meat packing man's son coming from was it Illinois and he went out west and he never found the the character he was looking for in a in a girl in Illinois so he thought you know I'll go west and they heard hey the the the man's coming this millionaire and he's going to going to have this big shind dig and he's going to you know he's looking for a wife and my they put on the big big shind dig and uh he danced and they did all thing you know they had their western wear their dresses and all the re and things on and and uh my he was just as disappointed there as he had been in in Chicago I guess it was and so he stepped out on the back the of the back porch to get a breath of fresh air and there he saw the little cousin she was related to all those girls inside but she was a servant girl not deemed you know fit or worthy to gotten dressed up and be a part of the ball and she's out there throwing out the dishwater and he he speaks to her and he says do you know why I'm here she says oh my she she didn't want to speak to him but see he was revealing to her his purpose for coming and she was having a very intimate conversation with him that none of the others were privy to and he's then he says I see in you and I'm paraphrasing I see in you the character that I'm looking for and longing for and what is absent from all of these others I'm here to find a wife and I want you to be my wife and she didn't even feel worthy but you know she accepted his proposal and he said now at an appointed time I'm going to return and I'm going to take you from this place to my home to my mansion and she went right back in there washing the dishes he no doubt went back in there and they finished the ball and the next day he got on his horse went back home now all those girls all those denominations that experienced his visitation went right on back to what they used to do and the only one whose behaviors changed was the one who received the essence of why he came amen amen and she started getting ready for his return she kept on washing dishes she kept on scrubbing floors as far as they were concerned nothing had changed in her value or worth but her conduct sure changed because late up in the night she'd be burning a candle getting that Treasure Chest packed up getting her wedding garments prepared and getting everything ready for his return now the world saw a prophet with signs and wonders the king of England was prayed for by him uh Congressman Upshaw was prayed the world testified God has visited this Earth in a great healing and signs and wonders Revival Ministry but there was another group that Heard a Voice they said I'm coming back and it has put her into a mode of preparation to ready her for the return of Christ she heard her name called by the message of the hour amen the the actual sounding of the trumpet the trumpet I'm I'm kind of moving into the Rapture here which begins with a shout which is a message to gather the people amen amen it's together I I I uh they've got something called sympathetic resonance where if a note is played and there's another like if if a if a if an e if the note of e is played on that piano any string here that's tuned to that same note will begin to sound amen amen right why because it's tuned to the same thing so when the message sounded it caught the attention and made others who were tuned to the same thing it begin to resonate with them it's the shout going to gather the bride amen or gather the attributes of Christ into him the prevailing revelation of who he is amen is about to bring her into translation into changing our literal atoms amen these bodies will be transformed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and we're going to meet him in the air who sent this message to us Amen to ready us for his return hallelujah praise God praise God JN heard his name it called from the Lamb's Book of Life and then hear this this little book CU there's now only a few names remaining to be called now it's just a little book when John saw it in the Ephesian ages probably had millions of names perhaps now there's just a few left but this book and remember brother bam creates a distinction between the revealing of it and then the actual calling of the names but the message preached is calling the names of the elect and you're you're hearing your identification you're hearing you don't hear lee LEL or Aon Roberts or or June Dell you're you're hearing your identification Mrs Jesus Christ you're hearing who you were all along and you're saying that's who I am that word that is exact something is answering that and the Revelation is emerging and the other is fading away the other is drifting away everything that doesn't match that word is being honed away amen amen I uh I'm up against the clock again can we turn into Revelation chapter 21 and uh brother get that picture ready um I do work from from time to time since 2008 I believe 2007 I went to Romania 2008 I began to visit the Czech Republic and this year in uh October I visited the country of Hungary for the first time but in the city in Czech Republic there is a city there uh called harit clava and it's called the city of the king they have a lot of castles in that c in those countries in and in Czech Republic uh so this city of the King was where the King's throne was where he lived where he reigned where he conducted the business and the Affairs of the Kingdom were in and that that's that's not the picture that that I'm showing you right now but um in in in the city of the king is where the the the capital or the you know it was the center of his Dominion right was there in that City now that King who had CLA also built another city and I can't I don't remember the name of it but it was called the city of the queen he built her her own castle and her own City somewhere else and he and he put put a lot of distance there and they said because she had her own agenda she had her own Affairs right she had her own things going on that was a hindrance to him and what he was doing so he built his is Queen her own City somewhere off in the distance so she had a city called the city of the queen right now this picture I'm showing you is a picture of the Parliament building in Budapest Hungary which is the capital city of Hungary I only had a few hours there on a Sunday evening after the meetings wrapped up I had to fly out early Monday morning so they took me to this city uh at Budapest which is on a river at at at one time it was two countries and one side was buha and the other side was P now it's one city but this is the Parliament building at night and I took this photograph from my from my phone camera through the window of a car quite a building quite a picture right so John here in in Revelations chapter 21 says There came unto me I'm in verse nine there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the last seven plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife maybe I could say this I will show thee Christ The Mystery of God revealed in Bride form come and I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away into the spirit to a great and high mountain now one thing about these castles is they are often situated on an elevated place right they are often situated up on the Mountaintop for visibility and also for protection to come against them you got to climb and Scurry all the way up the side of this mountain and then you got to get over this great wall that they have built to fortify it but remember Jesus said a city that is set on a hill or a light that is set on cannot be hid the bride is the same way the castles are always situated in a place of prominence a place of high visibility and it's always where the real estate is worth the most amen that's right it's exactly right I've traveled I Liv for nine years in South Carolina it really it doesn't it's all throughout the the United States you go into a little town it' be flat as a flitter and it'll be one little Hill and on that Hill is the courthouse on that Hill is the most prominent place why it's it's it's if a flood happens it's the last place that's going to flood it's the most expensive real estate in the town oh my friend I'm trying to help you see who you are the bride the Lamb's wife is the most valuable she's so valuable he was willing to give his own life to redeem hers Hallelujah I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light and I've got this reference to Isaiah 60 arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee if you looked at that building just a minute ago you notic it was illuminated it looked like it was glowing so is the BR praise the Lord her light was liken to a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as Chrystal now I showed you the Parliament building but let me tell you something about that building and the castle of the king and the castle of the queen in harit Kiva in Washington DC in wherever those will one day all be powder dust and Rubble let me show you another city let me show you what John saw can you bring it up brother John didn't see Jerusalem John didn't see the temple that Jesus said there shall not be one stone left on another John saw these people right here that's the Bride of Hungary and if you want to see that City look in the mirror of God's word and there you will see what John saw amen you're a part of that this evening friend and you are the Prevailing Revelation you are the mystery of God finished amen here in this hour because you've been captured by the message of the hour and the revelation of who Christ is is taking preeminence Hallelujah and it's driving out every opposing Force
