[1:39] and if you want to see you got a look
[1:41] into the word let's turn over an exodus
[1:46] chapter to Monica and Zoe our home
[1:49] because it was that we was saved and I
[1:51] said y'all just
[2:01] I'll speak tonight on a little topic of
[2:04] overcoming power
[2:12] let's read Exodus to verse 11 to 14
[2:16] let's just go to the Lord in prayer well
[2:19] God we're so grateful to you tonight to
[2:21] be able to come together around your
[2:24] word and look into your word the mirror
[2:25] of your word Lord you just to see how we
[2:27] compare and stack up and I pray God I
[2:30] know that you'll just be with us tonight
[2:32] or to open up your word to us to receive
[2:35] a blessing and we've come expecting Lord
[2:37] Jesus I believe we're all expecting a
[2:39] change to your changes Lord Jesus from
[2:42] the creatures that we that we are now
[2:44] even to do more and more like you I pray
[2:48] God that you'll just grant it Lord that
[2:50] you'll open up your word to us and we
[2:51] invite you into our hearts and into this
[2:53] place now we pray in the name of the
[2:55] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:59] Exodus chapter 2 verse 11 to 14 and it
[3:07] came to pass in those days when Moses
[3:10] was grown then he would out unto his
[3:13] brethren and looked on their burdens and
[3:15] he spied an Egyptian smiting and Hebrew
[3:18] one of his brethren and he looked this
[3:21] way and that way and when he saw that
[3:24] there was no man he slew the Egyptian
[3:26] and hid him in the sand and when he went
[3:31] out the second day behold two men are
[3:37] they Hebrews strove together and he said
[3:39] to him that did the wrong wherefore
[3:41] samadhis now my fellow and he said who
[3:44] made thee a prince and a judge over us
[3:46] intend us now to kill me as thou kill us
[3:49] the Egyptian and Moses feared and said
[3:52] surely this thing is known may be seated
[3:56] the Lord's blessing to the reading hour
[3:59] so I want to speak on overcoming power
[4:03] and talk about what it takes to get it
[4:06] and the recipe for how to get it and in
[4:10] this in this little story this is maybe
[4:13] a hard Scripture
[4:14] be talking about overcoming power but in
[4:17] this little story we were reminded of
[4:20] this you know we know about how Moses
[4:23] was his mama taught him all you know
[4:28] growing up that he was going to be the
[4:30] deliverer that he was gonna taught him
[4:32] about the word and showed him the things
[4:34] that were that were spoken of him and
[4:37] kind of placed him and identified him
[4:40] about who he was going to be so he began
[4:43] to look into think about those things
[4:46] and as he got older maybe he was
[4:49] thinking well you know I'm supposed to
[4:51] deliver these people so now is the time
[4:55] and so you know he what he did was he he
[5:00] he he he thought I'm gonna I'm gonna
[5:02] help Israel I'm gonna help deliver
[5:04] Israel I'm gonna get up and I'm gonna
[5:07] help woman and and I'm gonna solve their
[5:10] problems in this way but the problem was
[5:12] that he wasn't equipped to do it
[5:15] and so so we know that he was
[5:19] predestinated to destroy the enemy he
[5:22] was born to destroy the enemy to destroy
[5:25] all those things he was predestinated
[5:28] for that cause but yet he started off on
[5:32] the wrong foot
[5:33] he started off on the wrong the right
[5:35] footing with the wrong foundation is
[5:37] that he he went into it with the right
[5:40] motive and the right objective but yet
[5:42] he was not equipped for that task and we
[5:46] know that God equips a man when he calls
[5:48] him me he puts puts in him something to
[5:51] do the work to to fight the battle and
[5:54] so so Moses you imagine somebody on a
[5:57] battlefield and they and they look down
[5:59] at their hands and they find out that
[6:01] they don't have a sword in their hand
[6:02] and they look down at their their feet
[6:05] and their feet are not shod with the the
[6:08] preparation of the gospel of peace and
[6:10] they look like their head and it's not
[6:11] the helmet of salvation is not up there
[6:13] and they look at their chest and the
[6:15] Blessed plate parade of righteousness is
[6:17] not on their chest and and it looks like
[6:20] you know why would they even go into
[6:23] battle that way to begin with to try to
[6:26] overcome the
[6:27] enemy but in this case you know it seems
[6:31] like so many today do so many kind of
[6:33] you you know go into battle without the
[6:35] right kind of preparation without the
[6:38] right kind of equipment without the
[6:40] right kind of and you know what it turns
[6:43] out to be is it's like these two these
[6:46] two men looking at Moses how he had
[6:49] failed he had turned into a murderer
[6:52] because he went about it the wrong way
[6:55] he went about it the wrong way and it
[6:57] turned in it turned him into a murderer
[7:00] where he was a pro because he approached
[7:03] it the wrong way and you look at you
[7:06] look at so many other people in the
[7:07] Bible they like Paul he started off
[7:10] without the right equipment he started
[7:14] off with the right with the right motive
[7:16] and the right objectives like Gamaliel
[7:18] had taught him he had said under his
[7:20] feet and he knew all the letters and
[7:22] everything but yet something was
[7:25] something was wrong because he went out
[7:28] killing people he was a murderer there
[7:32] he stood holding the coat of stephen
[7:34] there he stood watching these Christians
[7:37] be killed for their faith and and and it
[7:41] turned out to just be absolutely the
[7:44] wrong path because he started off not
[7:47] equipped the right way you know there's
[7:52] so many other people in the Bible that
[7:54] they're written of that that they
[7:56] started off down the wrong path and they
[7:59] ended up being killers because they
[8:02] attack the wrong thing they attack the
[8:04] Word of God they attacked the thing that
[8:07] would be really trying to help them the
[8:09] most you look at Paul and David turned
[8:12] out to be a killer and then here this
[8:14] Moses a killer and he destroyed the
[8:18] Egyptian and it turned out to be a great
[8:20] disappointment as all these people stood
[8:22] there looking at him at a horrible
[8:25] disappointment of failure I thought you
[8:27] were supposed to be the deliverer I spot
[8:30] you I thought you were supposed to be
[8:32] helping me and it turned out to just be
[8:34] you know they they looked on him and and
[8:38] what what did Moses do he tried
[8:41] to cover it under the sand because it
[8:44] said in verse 12 and he looked this way
[8:46] and that way and he when he saw that
[8:47] there was no man he slew the Egyptian
[8:51] and hid him in the sand and you wonder
[8:54] if those sands began to sift back or we
[8:57] don't know how those two men began to
[8:59] they uncovered the thing that Moses had
[9:02] done but one way or the other it was
[9:04] uncovered so that's the that's the thing
[9:08] we you know we want our problems to be
[9:10] uncovered so that they can be dealt with
[9:12] so that they can be brought into life
[9:14] because because when the problem was
[9:17] uncovered then Moses realized that he
[9:20] was not equipped that he did not have
[9:23] that overcoming power that he needed to
[9:26] deliver the children of Israel and so
[9:28] then he could do something about it
[9:30] of course what he did was he he ran off
[9:33] into the wilderness he ran off into the
[9:35] desert because he was afraid he was
[9:38] scared and so he ran away he began to
[9:40] run away from Pharaoh and you see that's
[9:43] one of the identifying characteristics
[9:45] of a man that does not have overcoming
[9:48] power is that there's something in then
[9:51] that shakes that trembles that at the
[9:55] prospect of being being something being
[9:58] brought in the light of something being
[9:59] shared publicly of something being
[10:02] identified and so we ran off into the
[10:05] desert running coward and you know how
[10:08] brother Brown talked about how that God
[10:09] can't use a coward he can only use
[10:12] somebody that well you can only use
[10:14] somebody that's equipped to fight the
[10:16] battle and the only way that you can be
[10:18] equipped to fight the battle is by the
[10:20] Word of God there's no other way and so
[10:24] so you you see I'm gonna get into some
[10:27] quotes here I got a lot of quote reading
[10:29] but the the problem with people that are
[10:32] not equipped in this day is that you
[10:35] might be it might look on the outside
[10:37] like you're equipped to fight the battle
[10:39] but down on the inside there's something
[10:42] that's lacking something that's not
[10:44] right and it will war against the truth
[10:46] it will fight out and lash out and
[10:48] something won't be right down on the end
[10:51] something will be messed up and we call
[10:54] that anointed ones and so what anointed
[10:57] ones will do is you know back in the
[10:59] Garden of Eden the the very first
[11:03] preacher really was was a was Satan and
[11:07] he came down and he began to preach his
[11:09] ideas and the way he preached here was
[11:11] he just took what God said and just
[11:14] added a little bit or took a little bit
[11:16] away from it and so you see the great
[11:18] danger of of preaching the gospel is if
[11:21] you don't preach it absolutely right
[11:24] down the line you can either give a life
[11:27] or you can take it away
[11:28] you can either give a life or you can
[11:31] become a murderer you can become a
[11:34] killer if you don't preach it absolutely
[11:37] exactly right down the line
[11:40] so Moses he went running into the desert
[11:43] and he went he went to get equipped I
[11:46] wonder if he went running around in the
[11:49] desert he's thinking about how am I
[11:52] supposed to get equipped and you know a
[11:55] lot of times that's how people and go
[11:56] they go to church and they and and they
[11:58] and they sit there for years and there
[12:00] they begin to wonder well how am i how
[12:03] do I get equipped and they and they
[12:05] study the message and they study the
[12:07] quotes and still everything doesn't come
[12:09] together and you need to be equipped and
[12:12] so the RIT the way to get equipped
[12:13] here's a little secret the seed has to
[12:16] come through the body and so you got to
[12:20] get in touch with somebody that has it
[12:22] that problem is that we try to figure it
[12:24] out on our own and we go off on our own
[12:26] and we and we say well it looks like
[12:29] it's this so I think you know I think
[12:31] it'll probably work like that and that
[12:34] that will just mess everything up
[12:36] that is that is I know worst problem to
[12:43] go off and try to figure it out for
[12:46] yourself instead of getting in touch
[12:48] with somebody that knows how everything
[12:50] works because the that's God's plan is
[12:56] that the word has to come through the
[12:58] body it goes from one to the other and
[13:01] one picks up the word and
[13:03] quickens experience to them they get the
[13:05] revelation and then they know what it
[13:07] says so that they can share it with you
[13:09] and if you don't get in touch with one
[13:12] of the body members then you're you're
[13:14] really out of look like the Ethiopian
[13:17] eunuch that said how am I supposed to
[13:19] know this is so - unless some money will
[13:21] help me how am I supposed to understand
[13:23] unless somebody will help me and so if
[13:26] you don't get in touch with somebody in
[13:28] the body if you don't go to them to ask
[13:31] for questions and and and find out for
[13:33] yourself and the danger here is that
[13:35] you're looking outside they'll be an
[13:38] anointing it on the outside and look
[13:40] right and correct but down on the inside
[13:43] something is warring with the truth
[13:45] something will kill and destroy and
[13:48] murder the truth because this something
[13:51] there's something out of joint
[13:52] something's not right
[13:54] the truth is what will set you free the
[13:58] truth is what will will give you
[14:00] overcoming power and liberty and release
[14:03] you from the bonds of sin and death and
[14:05] sickness and horror and all those things
[14:08] let's read quote number 1 you must be
[14:16] born again brother Branham said and I
[14:23] think these are all things that we we've
[14:25] read before but you realize how almost
[14:28] you know we think we think about how the
[14:30] in in the Garden of Eden how one word
[14:34] off was thou shalt not surely die
[14:38] just one word off but that's not the
[14:41] only place where the devil can sow
[14:45] something extra y'all just leave that up
[14:50] there but I'm gonna talk for a second
[14:52] you know you know you think about Moses
[14:55] coming on the scene and not being
[14:57] equipped that's where that's where the
[14:59] devil wants to get involved is when a
[15:02] minister is not equipped our son of God
[15:05] is not equipped he wants to get in there
[15:08] and get involved so that he can add
[15:11] something or subtract from it add a
[15:13] little extra requirement or
[15:15] little extra requirement and then nobody
[15:18] gets to be born again because you've got
[15:20] to have the right revelation you got to
[15:24] have the right words sewn to be born
[15:27] again if you don't have the right words
[15:29] sewn and the understanding correctly
[15:32] presented then then the devil won't
[15:34] leave the unclean spirit won't leave the
[15:37] life can't come into your heart
[15:40] everything just gets all messed up you
[15:45] must be born again brother Bram said you
[15:47] believe every word just the way it's
[15:50] wrote here we don't need and the Bible
[15:53] said it's of no private interpretation
[15:55] do you know what that means
[15:58] private interpretation private
[16:00] interpretation means you go off by
[16:02] yourself and huddle up and try to figure
[16:04] it out and then you say well this has
[16:07] got to be what it means and then you
[16:09] messed everything up
[16:11] you become a failure you become a
[16:13] disappointment you've become a murderer
[16:16] you become everything wrong
[16:18] everything is just messed up because you
[16:21] haven't gone into it with approaching it
[16:23] in the right way because it is of no
[16:25] private interpretation God interpreted
[16:29] it and this is the way it is don't the
[16:32] Bible say in 2nd Peter there the Bible
[16:35] is of no private interpretation
[16:37] certainly no private it's wrote just the
[16:40] way it means it right like that just
[16:43] leave it just the way its wrote here
[16:45] it'll bring the same results so that
[16:50] when the Bible says faith comes by
[16:53] hearing the word that's what it means it
[16:57] means if the word is presented to you
[16:59] and you receive it into the womb of your
[17:02] heart and you just say I believe it then
[17:05] that's all that's required that's the
[17:07] only requirement as you believe it and
[17:09] you confess it and confess it means you
[17:11] just say ah that's it that's it and
[17:14] that's all you've got to do but our
[17:17] problem is we go off with our little
[17:19] private interpretations and we'll say
[17:21] well it means this and that stops the
[17:23] whole plan of God how can you be born
[17:26] again if you've gone off with your own
[17:28] private interpretation
[17:30] you've got to receive it from the body
[17:33] you've got to you got to hear it from
[17:36] somebody and that's our problem we get
[17:38] questions and stuff and we're like well
[17:40] what does this mean and we won't go to
[17:42] somebody that knows the answer to find
[17:44] out what it means we try to figure it
[17:47] out for ourselves
[17:49] maybe I appreciate myself now false
[17:57] teachers will bring false births true
[18:00] prophets will bring the word the birth
[18:02] of the word Christ do you understand why
[18:05] that is because a false teacher a false
[18:09] Anointed One someone with just an
[18:11] anointing on their life but not a bored
[18:14] birth not the birth of the word in their
[18:18] soul will not know how to present it and
[18:21] so it will always come out wrong when
[18:25] they speak it it'll be something wrong
[18:28] in there because the Devils involved and
[18:31] he's the one adding or subtracting from
[18:34] it he's the one saying well now instead
[18:37] of just believing the word now you got
[18:40] to go do some novenas or push a quarter
[18:42] with your nose or do so you got to go
[18:44] talk to the priest and ask forgiveness
[18:46] and stuff like that all those all those
[18:49] things that we should have gotten away
[18:50] from when we came out of Catholicism but
[18:53] denominationalism and all those things
[18:55] all that stuff should have died do you
[18:58] know that's what a death is a death is
[19:01] not just solving and crying and stuff
[19:04] but a death is when you that old idea
[19:07] that you had you laid it down and you
[19:10] say well I don't believe that no more
[19:12] and a lot of time there's a lot of
[19:14] struggling and striving and everything
[19:16] when you you like if you like maybe
[19:19] Moses wandering around the wilderness
[19:21] school what does this mean what do I
[19:23] have to do now and then you get in touch
[19:28] with somebody in this case
[19:30] listen Moses was a prophet so he got it
[19:33] straight from God he downloaded
[19:36] directly from the source but you and I
[19:39] are not prophets we got to get it from
[19:42] another member of the body because the
[19:44] seed comes through the body false
[19:48] teachers will bring the false births
[19:50] true prophets will bring the word the
[19:53] birth of the word Christ false prophets
[19:57] will bring false birth the birth of
[19:59] churches the birth of Crees the birth of
[20:01] denominations and here you are
[20:03] Pentecostal brother false sensations and
[20:06] tell a man he's got the Holy Ghost he
[20:08] speaks with tongue listen see that's
[20:10] another thing that a false teacher will
[20:13] bring they'll put it instead of putting
[20:15] it on a revelation of the word instead
[20:18] of putting it on the evidence of the
[20:19] scripture they'll put it on some kind of
[20:22] sensation or some emotion I felt
[20:25] something I something like that listen
[20:27] when when the angel came to Mary and she
[20:30] said be it unto me according to thy word
[20:32] there was no evidence that anything had
[20:36] taken place oh she did what she looked
[20:39] at the angel that said be it unto me
[20:41] according that word she just confessed
[20:43] it and then then she went over to
[20:46] Elizabeth and the word began to come
[20:48] forth from her and she began to prophesy
[20:50] and speak of what was growing in her
[20:53] womb and even though I hadn't been born
[20:55] here even though I hadn't come forth it
[20:57] had been conceived something was moving
[21:00] in there and so when the Word of God is
[21:03] planted in your heart and something
[21:04] begins to move something begins to grow
[21:06] you might not have any kind of sensation
[21:10] any kind of emotion at all but something
[21:13] has taken place and a false teacher
[21:16] won't be able to identify that to you
[21:18] because they'll always put the evidence
[21:21] on an emotion or some kind of sensation
[21:23] something other than the word but the
[21:26] word is the evidence the revelation of
[21:28] the word and your life where your life
[21:30] has been changed you can see it and you
[21:33] got the works and the evidence is you
[21:36] can bring the word by word true prophets
[21:43] will bring the word the birth of the
[21:46] word Christ false prophets will bring
[21:49] false
[21:50] the birch of churches the birth already
[21:52] that he said I've seen devil's speak
[21:55] with tongues pencils a leg down and
[21:57] riding unknown tongues that don't mean a
[22:00] thing
[22:01] see it's got to be a life by their fruit
[22:04] you shall know them brother Branham do
[22:06] you believe in speaking in tongues yes
[22:08] sir you believe in shouting yes sir to
[22:12] be a Christian I believe that I believe
[22:14] God's Word but if the life isn't there
[22:16] to back it up and we believe in shouting
[22:19] but we believe in speaking in tongues
[22:22] and we believe in all of those things
[22:24] but you know a lot of times emotion and
[22:26] sensations is where the devil will get
[22:29] in the devil will get in and speak
[22:32] through somebody and make it look like
[22:34] they got discernment or something he'll
[22:36] get in there and speak something to
[22:38] shout it out or whatever and make it
[22:40] look like something's going on when
[22:42] really there ain't nothing going on he
[22:47] said get out there a stuffed shirt glory
[22:49] to God hallelujah and then tell me
[22:51] that's Christ Christ was humble meek and
[22:54] gentle go into a town and my you Jeff to
[22:56] just be be just brushed off the
[22:58] shoulders you know and everything has to
[23:00] be just right not a wrinkle in your suit
[23:02] and you have to have the very best or
[23:04] you won't even come at all and on and on
[23:12] listen the devil the devil has been
[23:15] after the seat of God trying to destroy
[23:18] it since the very beginning us this
[23:19] great warfare where the power the
[23:22] overcoming power of God in the bride is
[23:25] at war with the devil and the way that
[23:29] God does war with the devil is through
[23:31] the unadulterated seed word nothing
[23:35] added nothing subtracted it's absolutely
[23:38] the word and the way the devil does war
[23:41] with God as he tries to add something to
[23:44] it or take something from it they try
[23:46] and then cuz that stops everything if
[23:48] you've got something to add it or
[23:51] something subtracted you cannot have
[23:52] faith because that will not produce
[23:54] faith it will not produce anything it
[23:56] will just stop everything let's go
[24:02] quote number B Christ is revealed in his
[24:06] own word today so confused about the
[24:09] evidence of the holy ghost and so forth
[24:11] Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift
[24:14] that God has got but he cannot bring
[24:18] that word word by word that's where he
[24:22] failed in the Garden of Eden that's
[24:24] where he's always failed that's where
[24:26] them the tape on false anointed ones are
[24:29] anointed ones they can be anointed with
[24:30] the spirit speaking tongues dance shout
[24:34] preach the gospel and still a devil it's
[24:39] the inside her and then he says now
[24:43] remember jesus said all the father's
[24:44] given to me will come no man can come
[24:46] except my father draws him first you
[24:48] think about that that that it could be a
[24:50] deacon it could be a minister it could
[24:53] be anybody in the laity that thinks that
[24:56] they're born again because they prayed
[24:58] long enough to get a sensation or
[25:00] something but they didn't go to where
[25:03] the word was they didn't go to the
[25:06] source to understand to get a revelation
[25:09] to clear away all the doubts to clear
[25:13] away all the confusion to talk to
[25:15] somebody and say well this means this
[25:17] and this means that and so they didn't
[25:19] do that and so then it's then it gets
[25:21] all messed up let's look at number c1
[25:24] this he said now she one word not a
[25:28] whole Decalogue just one word she
[25:30] questioned God because it was presented
[25:32] to her in that light that that word was
[25:35] questionable God's Word cannot be
[25:38] questioned he meant just what he said
[25:40] but she questioned it because it was
[25:43] predicted her to her oh well God surely
[25:45] didn't mean that now see see how simple
[25:49] this is you and I can look at the word
[25:53] and think as we're reading something
[25:55] well God surely didn't mean that and
[25:58] you'll think that because of something
[26:00] somebody else said some you'll passed a
[26:03] minister that already told you something
[26:05] or somebody that you saw on Facebook or
[26:07] something that was planning in your mind
[26:09] and that's got to die that's what the
[26:12] death
[26:13] is that that thing that was planted as
[26:15] to die so that life can spring forth
[26:18] Oh God surely didn't mean that but he
[26:22] did mean that God means every word he
[26:26] says and it doesn't need any private
[26:29] interpretation it's just the way he said
[26:32] it well say how you know about the Bible
[26:35] I believe that my God has guided this
[26:37] Bible he watches over his word he knows
[26:39] that atheists and infidels would arise
[26:41] in the last days
[26:42] so he's watched over it this is exactly
[26:46] the way God minute it's the way it's to
[26:49] us now now we must believe it one word
[26:51] off of it and we lose our fellowship go
[26:54] off into death eternal separation from
[26:57] God just as Adam and Eve did we must
[26:59] believe God's truth because one word
[27:03] added or subtracted will mess everything
[27:06] up your name goes off the list because
[27:10] you've added something and adding is as
[27:13] simple as saying instead of just
[27:15] believing
[27:16] well now you got to do this instead of
[27:19] just believing God's Word and confessing
[27:21] then you got to do something extra
[27:24] there's no other extras listen we
[27:27] there's a lot of things that go around
[27:29] the new birth there's a lot of things
[27:31] that like we go to church you got you
[27:34] got to go to church right you get you
[27:36] need to go to church there's things that
[27:38] you have to do you there's a whole
[27:42] economy of things that have to happen
[27:44] but the basis of your revelation the
[27:47] basis of the requirement of the
[27:49] overcoming power is that you have heard
[27:51] the word and you've received it through
[27:53] the right channel through the right
[27:55] interpretation presented to you by
[27:57] somebody that knows what they're talking
[28:00] about and then you receive it and it
[28:03] becomes a revelation to you because it's
[28:07] quicken where the RAM said it will say
[28:13] how you know about the Bible I believe
[28:15] that my God has guided this Bible he
[28:17] watches over his word he knows that
[28:18] atheist and infidels would arise in the
[28:21] last days so he's watched over it this
[28:23] is exactly the way God minutes
[28:26] away it's to us now now we must believe
[28:29] it did already there I show dear come on
[28:33] ba you with the program all right and we
[28:40] lose our fellowship go off into death
[28:42] eternal separation from God just as Adam
[28:44] and Eve did we must believe God's truth
[28:50] let's look at number D how I got to mix
[28:54] the letters and numbers cuz I I put I
[28:58] got carried away when I was robbed my
[29:00] name
[29:03] Satan and Eden when he first come to
[29:06] these attack to attack a person knowing
[29:10] the children of God was fortified with
[29:12] this word Satan attacked the word
[29:16] see that's what Satan's tactic is to
[29:19] strike out at the word at the source of
[29:22] the thing and see that's where Moses
[29:24] messed up and Paul messed up Paul not
[29:27] have being equipped to do it right
[29:30] lashed out at the thing that would help
[29:32] him the most not having the right
[29:35] understand and lashed out at it and
[29:37] struck at it because he wasn't equipped
[29:40] right but when you get the equipment
[29:42] then you know what's right and
[29:45] everything lines up so you never attack
[29:49] the being he attacked the word first
[29:51] look at that sneaker lizard what he does
[29:54] a day that's funny that's like you know
[29:57] how Jesus called here that old Fox
[30:00] look at that sneaker lizard what he does
[30:02] today the first thing he can't lay it on
[30:04] say well that's not a good person that's
[30:06] a good person see but the only thing he
[30:10] tries to do no matter how good the
[30:13] person is is to get them to deny that
[30:15] word that's just the only only thing he
[30:18] wants to do get you to deny that word
[30:21] now I'm not trying to scare anybody but
[30:24] it's easy to deny the word if you don't
[30:26] have the right interpretation of it
[30:28] because you can look at the word and say
[30:31] I believe that I believe it but like my
[30:35] through 28:19 I believe that at Matthew
[30:39] 20
[30:39] 19 is the scripture we always go to
[30:41] refer to such things as this you look at
[30:43] that and say I believe that but you
[30:45] don't have the right understanding to it
[30:47] for it and to get the right
[30:48] understanding you got to go to somebody
[30:50] that does so they can tell you to look
[30:52] there's not jesus is not three person
[30:55] preet three different people hey God is
[30:58] not three different people he's he's one
[30:59] God with with different attributes and
[31:04] then somebody can explain that to you
[31:06] and you and the light bulb goes oh oh
[31:08] and what that does is when somebody
[31:10] explains it as that kills that old idea
[31:12] it's David it's dead and bird in the
[31:16] ground and it won't be like that
[31:17] Egyptian that Moses tried to cover up
[31:20] where the the sand maybe drifted away
[31:22] and somebody comes by says it's not dead
[31:24] or there it is or whatever it'll be
[31:27] it'll be really dead but the only thing
[31:32] he tries to do no matter how good the
[31:34] person is is to get them to deny that
[31:36] word that's just the only thing he wants
[31:37] to do get you to deny that word so Satan
[31:40] tried to attack the word in the Garden
[31:42] of Eden so he had to have something now
[31:44] that he could use to the human being
[31:47] would look better than that word see he
[31:50] had to have something that would look
[31:51] better to the human being than word and
[31:54] do you know what he used reasoning just
[32:00] what we'd say common sense and common
[32:02] sense looks like you're reading the word
[32:06] are you reading the message and brother
[32:08] branham says something a little bit
[32:10] confusing or strange like for example
[32:12] the one example I like to give us is
[32:15] where brother Branham was telling the
[32:17] story of Haman and the old testament of
[32:19] how he naman how he had to go dip into
[32:23] the river Jordan seven times how he had
[32:26] to go dip and brother Brown back in 1951
[32:28] said he didn't have to dip he just had
[32:31] to believe and then later on in another
[32:33] message he said he had to dip wherever
[32:35] he was gonna keep that leprosy well that
[32:38] can be a little bit confusing you know
[32:40] you know what it is is you all you have
[32:42] to do is believe but some people are a
[32:45] little bit stubborn and they're
[32:46] believing so that need a little
[32:48] jump-start or like you your car when
[32:50] your battery dies you need somebody to
[32:52] go
[32:52] but off and so name and need a little
[32:55] jump starter and so he had to go dip
[32:58] seven times some people have to have to
[33:01] do some people have to come up to the
[33:03] altar some people have to shout a little
[33:05] bit it's not that you have to do those
[33:07] things
[33:08] but if God requires it of you you must
[33:10] be willing to do it that's the thing
[33:12] that you must be willing to do it if
[33:15] it's required of you but the thing is
[33:17] the basis of it all is faith in the word
[33:21] faith in the word we're Maya let's go to
[33:28] II Hebrews chapter seven and you people
[33:38] with these sawblade tempers that's
[33:39] always spouting off of the mouth of
[33:41] somebody can't put up and things like
[33:42] that say I'm going I'm switching back
[33:44] over to the murderer Moses the murderer
[33:48] of Paul the murderer David who Bacall
[33:52] something wasn't right
[33:53] something was at conflict he murdered
[33:56] his brother you're guilty if you speak a
[34:00] word against your brother that's not
[34:01] right not just go around and tear down
[34:04] it you don't have to stick a knife and a
[34:06] man's back to kill him you can break his
[34:09] character and kill him kill his
[34:10] influence speak against your pastor here
[34:13] say something bad about him you just
[34:15] might as well as shot him told something
[34:19] that wasn't right about him well it'll
[34:21] kill his influence with the people and
[34:23] things like that and you're guilty of it
[34:26] what Jesus said guilty of it guilty of
[34:30] being a murderer a murderer like Moses
[34:33] and David and Paul and all these others
[34:35] but I'm thankful that God has made a way
[34:38] for the murderers you know brother
[34:40] branham and Smyrna in this murder in
[34:42] church age he says and here he is
[34:44] talking about the seven golden
[34:46] candlesticks walking in the midst of
[34:48] those who he meet whom he has redeemed
[34:51] even his church and what were those who
[34:54] were redeemed were not many like Paul
[34:57] murderers and corrupters were not many
[35:00] like the dying thief robbers and min
[35:03] killers all trophies
[35:05] his grace all brought back from the dead
[35:08] all made alive in Christ Jesus all made
[35:13] alive some gods overcoming power is able
[35:16] to take a murderer and transform them
[35:19] into something that he can use he can
[35:21] take somebody like Moses who was
[35:23] wandering in the desert and after 80
[35:25] years God finally caught up with him and
[35:27] he could transform his life and equip
[35:30] him and put a sword in his hand
[35:32] or in this case a rod a stick and tell
[35:34] him how to use it what to do with it
[35:36] when to drop it and pick it up and how
[35:38] long to leave it on the ground give him
[35:40] knowledge of how to operate the gift
[35:42] and show him what to do with it God is
[35:47] able to transform and I just thank God
[35:49] for His grace I feel like I feel like
[35:51] you know like Dwight knew who I think it
[35:53] was white moody that he came running
[35:55] down from that from the from upstairs
[35:57] where he was arenas Bible and ask
[35:58] somebody do you know grace because grace
[36:01] is what we all need grace to extend it
[36:04] to the chiefest of sinners grace to the
[36:07] to the murderers and the sinners and
[36:09] that all the different all the long list
[36:11] of the ones where Paul said and such
[36:13] were some of you that God has
[36:15] transformed us by by the renewing of our
[36:18] minds to transform us from our own ideas
[36:21] and our private interpretations and our
[36:24] carnal interpretation of the scripture
[36:25] until we have the mind of Christ so we
[36:28] can see things the same way he does and
[36:30] you know what when you see things the
[36:32] same way that he sees it then you begin
[36:34] to love one another you begin to love
[36:36] your brother and sister and everything
[36:38] just begins to line up just exactly
[36:40] right now I don't want to leave Moses in
[36:43] the desert you know Moses is problem
[36:49] really the greatest enemy he had the
[36:52] greatest enemy that all of us have is
[36:54] when you look in the mirror the greatest
[36:57] problem that Moses had was himself and
[37:00] that's why God had to let him run around
[37:03] in the desert until he kind of he got
[37:05] all that let all that self die out and
[37:08] he was ready for God to deal with him
[37:10] maybe if he hadn't let him
[37:12] do that and and work you know let the
[37:15] hot burning Sun beat down I mean let
[37:17] it's a poor nag him and be to own him in
[37:20] you know sometimes you sometimes God
[37:22] will brother branham said this that God
[37:25] would give you a spouse or let you have
[37:27] a spouse to that would be the cross that
[37:30] you bear in life he might not have said
[37:33] it exactly that way but it is something
[37:35] to that effect so maybe he didn't say
[37:38] the cross that you would bear but
[37:39] something something like that it would
[37:41] be the thing it would be something to
[37:46] help you yes yeah it's in there
[37:57] somewhere
[37:58] it would be something that would be
[38:01] almost a blessing in disguise for you to
[38:04] strengthen you and help you to become in
[38:07] a place where God can deal with you so
[38:09] that you know that that you need God and
[38:12] all of those other things that go with
[38:14] that and not just spouses and now I'm
[38:17] not just talking about that but all all
[38:19] the different things in life because you
[38:21] know brother Bevin said that life is a
[38:23] struggle it's supposed to be a struggle
[38:25] it's supposed to be a hard thing work
[38:27] you just you you know sometimes going to
[38:31] church is hard sometimes it's hard
[38:33] dealing with people it's hard going to
[38:35] work is hard and it's supposed to be
[38:37] like that so that you don't get easy and
[38:39] complacent and me it's supposed to be a
[38:41] combative to this old layout of seeing
[38:44] spirit where you you get rich and
[38:46] increased with Goods and feel like you
[38:48] have need of nothing because if life is
[38:50] a struggle then it's a constant reminder
[38:52] that you need God if there's barely any
[38:55] money in the bank sometimes if there's
[38:57] the funds are low if the kids are always
[39:00] you know worrying about things that all
[39:02] kinds of things are happening
[39:04] everything's going wrong then you
[39:06] realize that you need God and it'll put
[39:08] you in the right and the right frame to
[39:10] approach him with and so Moses one day
[39:18] one day he's walking along and he and he
[39:21] chases a sheep or whatever you know that
[39:23] some of the 10 commandments or what
[39:25] kind of puts it he he's falling a little
[39:27] sheep up into the mountains and and
[39:29] something catches his eye and he sees a
[39:32] bush burning wonder what a strange thing
[39:35] but you know the see that's what that's
[39:37] what catches a lot of people's attention
[39:39] and they're so interested in the burning
[39:41] bush that they pay no attention to the
[39:44] voice they so much they're so interested
[39:46] in the signs and the wonders and the
[39:48] sensations and and having a nice
[39:50] experience and and just being a nice
[39:53] good Christian with the devil nice and
[39:56] happy inside of you but you know that
[39:58] you know brother Brennan said that the
[40:00] devil will get nice at home in your
[40:02] church nice and comfy and and because
[40:06] there's no revelation to boot him out
[40:08] there's nothing that there's no word
[40:10] that you're believing because you've got
[40:13] your own private and corporate
[40:14] interpretations there's nothing to give
[40:17] him the boot so the devil gets nice and
[40:19] comfy and he's sitting there in church
[40:21] having a good old time what was I
[40:25] talking about but so you see Moses he
[40:31] wasn't just looking he came for the
[40:33] burning bush like the like the believers
[40:36] did when they that the first pull and
[40:39] the second pool they came for those
[40:41] those kind of things but what brother
[40:44] branham was really after was the big
[40:46] rainbow trout that would be interested
[40:48] in the voice in that in the opening of
[40:52] the word and so when and the Bible says
[40:55] in Exodus chapter 4 when the Lord saw
[40:58] that he turned aside to see could you
[40:59] just imagine maybe dramatized it the
[41:02] Lord's called put the boot on bush on
[41:04] fire and he's black put the bait out
[41:06] there he's fishing he's fishing for
[41:09] believer he's fishing for Moses and he
[41:11] saw he turned aside to see yes I got him
[41:15] and that's what that's what that's why
[41:17] brother all those visions brother
[41:18] Branham had of the pools and all of
[41:20] those different things he's fishing he's
[41:22] fishing for the believer and he puts
[41:24] something attractive on the hook to get
[41:26] you to turn aside so that then you'll
[41:29] hear the voice and the voice is the main
[41:31] thing and listen I'm a Maria I'm gonna
[41:33] read this the scripture here but I just
[41:36] want to think of you of this that mo
[41:38] has heard the voice but then see God
[41:41] wanted to put the voice in Moses he
[41:43] wanted to make his lips the mouthpiece
[41:46] and that's what stumbles a lot of people
[41:48] a lot of people don't they they stumble
[41:51] over that you have a confession
[41:53] there that's how it works that you just
[41:56] speak the word then it comes out of your
[41:59] mouth that the bride would be the voice
[42:01] in this last day that the voice that God
[42:04] has delivered to us and has been spoken
[42:05] through a prophet that you would have
[42:07] anything to do with that nobody wants to
[42:10] have anything to do with it that's where
[42:11] the stumbling is is they they stumbled
[42:13] all over the voice the voice is the
[42:15] thing the voice is the key the main
[42:17] thing know and see Moses stumble to that
[42:20] he said but but I got a problem with my
[42:25] mouth and it's sometimes it won't work
[42:28] right you know I've felt personally
[42:39] myself oh yeah that's one thing I kind
[42:42] of struggled with growing up and
[42:44] everything you know you go through
[42:46] school and you feel like well my mouth
[42:47] won't work right my mind is thinking one
[42:50] thing and my mouth says another and you
[42:52] you start to develop a complex that it
[42:54] just won't come out right and everything
[42:56] and so maybe Moses you know it practice
[42:59] makes perfect and you know you get up in
[43:01] front of people and you start talking at
[43:03] work they had us get up and talk years
[43:05] ago and and you begin to you know your
[43:08] brain starts sinking up with your mouth
[43:10] but you know that was my problem Moses
[43:13] was willing to solve Moses as God was
[43:16] willing to solve Moses problem without
[43:18] any speech therapy without any any going
[43:22] to some class to learn how to talk
[43:24] without any all that kind of stuff God
[43:27] was gonna put his voice into Moses mouth
[43:29] and Moses had his own private
[43:32] interpretation of how that was supposed
[43:34] to work he said well I think is I think
[43:37] it's got to work like this I think I'm
[43:40] supposed to be a good speaker or I'm
[43:42] supposed to be a smart man or I'm
[43:44] supposed to have a lot of education or
[43:46] something like that but God God is able
[43:49] to take it
[43:50] literate fishermen and make something
[43:52] out of it so in verse nine abut Exodus
[43:58] four it says and it shall come to pass
[44:00] because he tells him about all the signs
[44:02] and Moses said him the Lord o my Lord
[44:04] I'm not eloquent neither heretofore nor
[44:07] since thou has spoken under thy servant
[44:09] but I am slow of speech and of a slow
[44:12] tongue maybe that's the kind of person
[44:17] God can use there's somebody that feels
[44:19] like III don't think I can do it
[44:23] this I don't know if this is gonna work
[44:25] but see Moses God wants somebody to
[44:28] believe him and the Lord said unto him
[44:32] who hath made man's mouth who or who
[44:35] maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or
[44:37] the blind have not I the Lord
[44:39] now therefore go and I will be with our
[44:42] mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say
[44:44] and then he objected again mmm
[44:47] and he said old my lord send I pray thee
[44:50] by the hand of whom thou will see him
[44:54] he's asking very politely and around
[44:56] about wings do it let somebody else do
[44:59] it
[44:59] and III think that's maybe our our
[45:03] problem a lot of times is you we try to
[45:07] find a way around just accept in the
[45:10] Word of God that's stepping out in faith
[45:12] and doing something for the Lord and so
[45:15] the angle of the Lord was kindled
[45:16] against Moses and he said is not air and
[45:18] they leave I thy brother I know that he
[45:21] could speak well and also behold he
[45:24] cometh forth to meet the end so he set
[45:26] up that situation where Aaron will be
[45:28] the spokesperson that he would put his
[45:30] voice in Moses mouth and then Aaron
[45:32] would be the voice would be in him as
[45:34] well and so he went down into Egypt and
[45:38] now now after that he had heard the
[45:42] voice now he was equipped to go do what
[45:46] he had done before without being
[45:49] equipped before he was a murderer
[45:52] because he was not equipped that he came
[45:54] out doing everything wrong everything
[45:56] didn't turn out right but now he had
[45:59] he had the knowledge and the
[46:01] understanding he had a staff in his hand
[46:03] that God had given him he had two signs
[46:05] and he had the word of the Lord and he
[46:08] knew what to do with that rod so when he
[46:10] came before pharaoh and pharaoh with no
[46:13] fear and pharaoh's standing there saying
[46:17] listen you can't be free your people
[46:20] can't be free and moses with the
[46:23] knowledge that he had he just took that
[46:25] rod and dropped it right in front of him
[46:27] and just stood back and and watched the
[46:30] drama take place and out come the
[46:33] pageant magicians and they do their
[46:34] impersonation thing see how the
[46:36] impersonation is just like today where
[46:41] there's an impersonation there's an
[46:43] anointing but there's not something on
[46:45] the inside to be able to frame the word
[46:47] correctly to be able to preach it
[46:50] without without error so that so that it
[46:53] will produce something and so they were
[46:56] able to impersonate it they were able to
[46:58] make it look like they had the goods but
[47:01] on the inside there was nothing to back
[47:03] it up but Moses had the goods he was
[47:06] able to back it up and he knew how it
[47:08] worked
[47:09] that's what knowledge is is not just a
[47:12] lot of head knowledge but the the
[47:15] understanding of how everything works
[47:17] and so he let go of the rod and he just
[47:21] over he'd already let go he just stood
[47:23] there and he watched God work and he was
[47:26] patient and he he watched God that that
[47:31] serpent you know his rod devoured the
[47:34] other two serpents because he knew how
[47:37] to handle that serpent he knew how to
[47:39] handle the devil see Moses was coming
[47:42] down to Egypt on a path of utter
[47:45] destruction ready to destroy the works
[47:48] of the devil ready to lay waste to sin
[47:52] ready to lay waste to everything that
[47:54] would hold the children of Israel back
[47:56] he was ready to liberate them and now he
[47:58] was equipped he had no fear and see
[48:03] Satan was there telling them you can't
[48:05] be free and that's a lot of the things
[48:07] that are going around the message today
[48:09] they're saying that the people of the
[48:10] message are not free
[48:11] that they're in bondage that they're
[48:13] doing things just because just because
[48:15] somebody tells them to and they don't
[48:17] have an understanding of what Liberty is
[48:19] you know real Liberty it's being a
[48:22] prisoner of Christ what God has you in
[48:25] change your change of love where you're
[48:28] like I don't want to do anything to hurt
[48:30] my brother or my sister or to hurt God
[48:32] and so God so Moses went down clearing a
[48:37] path of destruction and his and his
[48:38] failure kept resisted he would unleash
[48:41] another plague by the spoken word until
[48:44] finally it got this destroy in the path
[48:47] destroying everything and finally I got
[48:49] to the last plague which was the
[48:51] unleashing of the destroyer which is
[48:53] what the scripture says in Exodus 12 it
[48:55] says then Moses called for all the
[48:57] elders of Israel and said unto them draw
[48:59] out and take you a lamb according to
[49:01] your families and kill the Passover and
[49:05] you shall take a bunch of hyssop that's
[49:07] how simple it is just take simple faith
[49:10] and apply the blood dip it in the blood
[49:12] that is in the basin and it strike the
[49:14] little and the two side posts with the
[49:16] blood is in the basin and none of you
[49:18] shall go out of the door of this house
[49:20] until the morning everybody had to stay
[49:23] under the blood under that token because
[49:26] of the destroyer was coming and when the
[49:28] destroyer comes it's not to hurt the
[49:31] children it's to liberate them to set
[49:34] them free for the Lord will pass through
[49:36] to smite the Egyptians and when you see
[49:38] at the blood upon the lintel and on the
[49:40] two side posts the Lord will pass over
[49:43] the door and will not suffer the
[49:45] destroyer to come in unto your houses to
[49:48] smite you that's over
[49:50] that's overcoming it's when God destroys
[49:53] all of the sin and all of the things in
[49:56] your life but the way that God does it
[49:58] the way that he doesn't even hear is by
[50:02] the word by laying out a word pass for
[50:06] them to follow you must apply the blood
[50:09] over the door you must do it with hyssop
[50:11] you must eat the lamb go in there eat it
[50:13] all what you don't eat burn it all of
[50:15] those things they had to do and then
[50:17] then then they were liberated and they
[50:20] they got all of the the gold and things
[50:23] from their neighbors they borrowed it
[50:25] and all
[50:25] they went God had equipped them for
[50:27] their journey and give them provision
[50:29] and then they got to the next great
[50:31] obstacle will God deliver us over this
[50:35] over this sea so we know that story that
[50:38] that through that through that
[50:41] deliverance God destroyed utterly all
[50:45] the Egyptians and that's I think that's
[50:49] what we're all struggling for through
[50:51] the opening of the word that God will
[50:53] destroy everything that's that's the
[50:56] experience of the new birth when you can
[50:59] look back like they did and look back to
[51:01] the past and see that your life has been
[51:04] changed and look back and see that the
[51:07] Egyptians have been destroyed in your
[51:09] life and when they got over on the other
[51:11] side that's when that's when Miriam and
[51:13] all of the women they took up timbrels
[51:15] and they begin to rejoice because listen
[51:18] when it's with God delivered what I
[51:20] think one of the one of my kids asked me
[51:22] that one time why do people sometimes
[51:24] they scream out in church what water
[51:26] sometimes people people let loose
[51:28] because God has delivered them on
[51:31] something when you get delivered of
[51:33] something there it'll produce it
[51:35] improves the reaction when you see grace
[51:38] in your life when you see that God has
[51:40] done something when you see the power of
[51:42] God working in your church and in your
[51:44] life then you realize that the the grace
[51:48] of God to you and it'll produce in a
[51:52] produced joy and a producer reaction but
[51:57] we don't want to go the opposite way and
[51:59] say well you got to jump up and down and
[52:02] you got to hop all around and all of
[52:05] that kind of stuff
[52:06] that's going in the wrong direction
[52:08] that's that's not right
[52:12] you want to you want to jump for the for
[52:15] a revelation
[52:16] you're not just because you want to
[52:18] maybe dramatic you think of all the
[52:24] times that think about this how Moses
[52:27] heard the voice and God put his voice in
[52:30] him and gave him the three signs he
[52:32] signed had a voice it spoke there was a
[52:34] message behind it and God wants to put
[52:37] his voice and you so
[52:38] you know the message and are able to
[52:40] speak it and confess it and that voice
[52:43] that voice destroys the enemy just like
[52:46] it did with Joshua in the Battle of
[52:48] Jericho remember how they gathered all
[52:50] around and they marched around all the
[52:52] different days and on the last day they
[52:54] gathered and they shouted with their
[52:56] their voice the the understanding that
[52:59] they had is what brought the walls down
[53:01] and everything came down except for the
[53:04] one just like in the in the that Old
[53:06] Testament story and that Exodus story
[53:08] except for the one that was under the
[53:10] token because that's what the destroying
[53:13] does that's what that that burning fire
[53:15] represents a consuming fire that's meant
[53:18] to burn out everything from your life
[53:20] except the things that are wrong or that
[53:23] are right to burn out all the wrong from
[53:25] your life to burn out everything that's
[53:27] sinful and and decadent and of the flesh
[53:31] worldly all those things and leave only
[53:34] a real Christian life we think about
[53:37] this story and when after they begin to
[53:40] journey through the wilderness in Exodus
[53:42] chapter 17 verse 8 through 14 it says
[53:45] they came upon the a Malayan and it says
[53:50] then came amalek and fought with Israel
[53:51] and were feed him and Moses said unto
[53:53] Joshua choose us out men and go out
[53:57] fight with emilich tomorrow tomorrow I
[53:59] will stand on the top of the hill with a
[54:01] rod of God in Montana so Joshua did as
[54:04] Moses has said to him and fought with
[54:06] emilich and Moses Aaron and Hur went up
[54:08] to the top of the hill and it came to
[54:11] pass when Moses held up his hand that
[54:12] Israel prevailed and when he let down
[54:14] his hand Emily prevailed but Moses hands
[54:18] were heavy and they took a stone and put
[54:21] it under him and he set their own and
[54:22] Aaron and her stayed up his hands the
[54:25] one on the one side and the other on the
[54:26] other side and his hands were steady
[54:29] until the going down of the Sun and
[54:31] Joshua discomfiting emilich and his
[54:33] people with the edge of the sword and
[54:34] the Lord said unto Moses write this for
[54:37] a memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[54:39] the years of Joshua for I will utterly
[54:41] put out the remembrance of Amalek from
[54:44] under heaven and if a Mallick represents
[54:47] the things that plagued Israel it
[54:49] represents the things that plagued you
[54:51] in your life
[54:52] God is able to utterly destroy that out
[54:55] of your life but the problem is
[54:57] sometimes we don't back up the man that
[55:00] has his hands up the man with the ball
[55:02] you know we need we all need to back up
[55:04] our pastor and stand behind him and lift
[55:07] his hands up so that the enemy can be
[55:09] utterly destroyed so that the enemy can
[55:12] be completely destroyed and conquered
[55:16] and then in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy
[55:22] Moses was talking into chapter 7 he was
[55:25] talking about the when they came upon
[55:27] the God God told him about the Hittites
[55:30] and the girgashites and the Amur ice and
[55:32] the Canaanites and what they were
[55:33] supposed to do with them and the way he
[55:35] said to deal with him he said thus shall
[55:38] you deal with him you shall destroy
[55:39] their altars and break down their images
[55:43] and cut down their groves and burn their
[55:47] graven images with fire and in other
[55:49] words have no mercy just destroy
[55:52] everything so that's what the power of
[55:55] God is doing power where the power of
[55:57] God is it's the revenue power comes from
[56:00] Revelation the revelation of his word
[56:03] the Pawel you know sometimes we think
[56:05] power comes from sensations and feelings
[56:07] and all that kind of stuff but power
[56:09] real power comes from a knowledge just
[56:12] like Moses had with his staff of whether
[56:14] to lift it up or whether to drop it or
[56:16] even having confidence that it would
[56:18] turn into a snake like he knew that God
[56:21] had showed into you and that's what
[56:23] power is that's a revelation and that
[56:26] kind of power is the kind of power that
[56:28] the gates of Hell cannot prevail against
[56:31] Matthew chicks 16 verses 13 through 19
[56:33] that was you that was that was enacted
[56:36] right outside of Capernaum and if you go
[56:39] to Capernaum my brother-in-law was
[56:40] telling me this because he just got back
[56:42] from Israel and y'all had gone to Israel
[56:44] before you'd probably seen this as well
[56:46] they actually having there's an actual
[56:48] gates of Hell there where it's called
[56:50] the gates of hell a big old pit or
[56:53] something where they throw they used to
[56:55] throw goats in as a sacrifice to pagans
[56:57] and everything and they called it the
[56:59] gates of hell and so Jesus was standing
[57:02] dear in Capernaum when he told the story
[57:04] when this thing was enacted and and when
[57:09] sight when he asked him who do you say
[57:10] that I am and Simon Peter Simon Peter
[57:16] answered it said thou art the Christ the
[57:18] Son of the Living God I know who you are
[57:19] and jesus answered and said unto Him
[57:21] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[57:24] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[57:25] but my father which is in heaven and i
[57:27] say also unto thee that thou art Peter
[57:29] and upon this rock I will build my
[57:31] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[57:33] prevail against it and I will give unto
[57:35] thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven
[57:37] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[57:38] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[57:40] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[57:42] loosed in heaven and you talk about
[57:44] binding and loosing binding and loosing
[57:47] comes from the revelation of the power
[57:49] of God because what it will do is it
[57:52] will loose you from your captivity and
[57:54] it will bind the devil so that the devil
[57:56] cannot work it will loose you so that
[57:58] you can you can be free it like it loose
[58:00] the children of Israel the power of God
[58:03] through the revealed word and it will
[58:04] bind the devil like he destroy them with
[58:07] it with the water that there of the Red
[58:09] Sea crashing in on them and then
[58:11] destroyed them while it loose the
[58:13] children of Israel because what it will
[58:15] do it was it will it will constrain it
[58:18] will destroy all it works to the flesh
[58:20] the lust of the flesh the pride of life
[58:22] the enmity by the revealed word as you
[58:25] hear all these stories of the revealed
[58:27] word and you're being preached over the
[58:29] pulpit of the price paid the way to be
[58:31] born again the God had true oneness what
[58:34] eternal hell is Redemption what the
[58:36] shout boys trump is all these things
[58:38] that combined together together to give
[58:41] the church overcoming power overcoming
[58:48] powers with what God is wanting to equip
[58:51] the church with you know that's what the
[58:56] the disciples the disciples were running
[59:01] around scared before the day of
[59:03] Pentecost wondering what was that what
[59:06] hide and wondering if they had really
[59:08] you know if everything really had
[59:11] happened the way that it was supposed to
[59:13] and all those different kind of things
[59:15] but on the day of Pentecost they got
[59:18] equipped and you know how they got
[59:21] equipped they got equipped with a combat
[59:25] beasts that first combat beasts was a
[59:28] lion roared in the lion when here or the
[59:31] scares all the enemy you like brother
[59:33] been talked about they that that lion
[59:35] rose on the day of Pentecost because the
[59:38] lion those for combat beasts represent
[59:40] the overcoming power of the revealed
[59:43] word in the bride fighting to destroy
[59:46] the works of the enemy that lion reared
[59:50] his head because they were armed with
[59:54] the power of that combat beast they were
[59:56] armed with the things that Paul talked
[59:59] about in Ephesians 6 where he said
[1:00:01] finally my brother and be strong in the
[1:00:03] Lord and in the power of his might put
[1:00:05] on the whole armour of God that you may
[1:00:07] be able to stand against the wiles of
[1:00:09] the devil for we wrestle not against
[1:00:11] flesh and blood but against
[1:00:12] principalities against powers against
[1:00:14] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:00:16] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:00:18] places
[1:00:18] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:00:21] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:00:22] in the evil day and having done all to
[1:00:25] stand stand therefore having your
[1:00:27] Lauren's gird about with truth and
[1:00:29] having on the breastplate of
[1:00:31] righteousness and your feet shod with
[1:00:34] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:00:36] and above all taking the shield of faith
[1:00:39] wherewith ecl be able to quench all the
[1:00:41] fiery darts of the wicked and take the
[1:00:44] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[1:00:46] Spirit which is the word of God and I'll
[1:00:51] just finish on this so the musicians can
[1:00:52] go ahead and come forward what we need
[1:00:55] to do to get that overwhelming
[1:00:57] oh that that overcoming power is you
[1:01:02] know when you come to church it's like
[1:01:03] going to the doctor and when you go to
[1:01:05] your doctor and the doctor says well
[1:01:07] don't take this drug or don't you got to
[1:01:10] take all the penicillin don't just take
[1:01:12] some of it because that'll cause a big
[1:01:14] old problem there back to you or rise up
[1:01:15] and they'll get stronger and all that
[1:01:17] kind of stuff you got to listen to your
[1:01:18] doctor if it'll work right and so when
[1:01:20] you come to church you got to listen to
[1:01:22] the doctor and the best thing that can
[1:01:24] happen to us is for is for something to
[1:01:27] be uncovered for something to be
[1:01:29] for you to find the remedy when you go
[1:01:31] to the doctor if the doctor says well
[1:01:33] this is you got a problem here you got a
[1:01:36] tumor or whatever it needs to be cut out
[1:01:38] or some kind of something that needs to
[1:01:40] be remedied then you could do something
[1:01:42] about it
[1:01:44] and so well I was just seeing right
[1:01:51] there let's just stand to your feet and
[1:01:55] we'll just go to the Lord in prayer well
