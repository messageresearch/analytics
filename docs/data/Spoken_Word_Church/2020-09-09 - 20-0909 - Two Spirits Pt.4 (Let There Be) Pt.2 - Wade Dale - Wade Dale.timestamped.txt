[19:00] giggle come from
[19:02] oh

[19:08] sounded like aaron was
[19:11] back there behind me i guess not all
[19:13] right
[19:14] good to be in the house of the lord good
[19:15] to have everybody here on a wednesday
[19:16] night
[19:18] good to see the new rep family i can't
[19:20] say i see you smiling face
[19:22] but i see you smiling faith
[19:24] we're good to have each and every one of
[19:26] you here
[19:27] and uh
[19:28] boy we've come to a place that uh
[19:31] everybody in the world prayer request is
[19:33] so long you can't hardly remember it and
[19:35] you you pray until midnight almost
[19:37] literally trying to call everybody's
[19:39] name
[19:40] and sometimes you just don't get there
[19:43] because there's so many
[19:45] uh brother joel is still fighting this
[19:47] thing be 60 something days and
[19:49] um now um
[19:52] there's another strain of virus
[19:54] going around
[19:56] so
[19:58] satan is the prince and power of the air
[20:00] right and this is where this is all it's
[20:03] all traveling
[20:05] but we're going to pray that we are
[20:06] going to be filtered
[20:09] that god's going to filter this now we
[20:10] got to live in it got to breathe
[20:13] got to eat got to touch doorknobs we got
[20:15] to go to work we got to do all these
[20:16] things but we pray that god will help us
[20:19] and protect us
[20:20] and keep us safe amen we believe he'll
[20:22] do that right
[20:24] amen so remember we're still now in
[20:26] phase two which is what you're looking
[20:27] at now everybody wear a mask except the
[20:29] preacher that's preaching
[20:30] even downstairs all right there's some
[20:33] downstairs now but sunday we'll do the
[20:34] same thing we'll be in phase two we will
[20:36] be at ten o'clock
[20:38] and at two o'clock as usual
[20:40] and then we'll have communion after the
[20:42] second service now
[20:44] don't worry about how we're gonna do it
[20:46] just be here
[20:48] brother dale and i'll kind of
[20:50] decide we'll pray over it all week just
[20:52] to see the safest way of
[20:54] of doing it and then we will definitely
[20:57] have communion though
[20:59] one way or the other amen so that's part
[21:02] of uh
[21:04] that's part of the ordinances that we go
[21:06] through
[21:07] and the part that i miss
[21:10] as much as anything else
[21:12] is to be able to
[21:15] you know brother branham
[21:17] even the bible tells us that if you take
[21:19] communion
[21:20] and you don't have things right in your
[21:21] heart
[21:23] then you could be eating and drinking
[21:24] damnation unto yourself
[21:26] i'll tell you a little story here just
[21:28] for a second i
[21:29] like i told you before we've been we not
[21:31] we me
[21:33] i've been battling some stuff in my
[21:35] flesh for a while you know sickness and
[21:38] not not sickness but enough to bother
[21:40] you
[21:41] and i told somebody at my psa level was
[21:44] up but i went to the doctor and he said
[21:45] don't worry about that
[21:47] and then other little things going on
[21:48] you know but still you you when you lay
[21:50] at night
[21:53] and you still hear that
[21:56] you you're laying there and you're
[21:57] saying lord
[22:01] why
[22:03] are you not moving
[22:08] like your word says
[22:11] said you'll come on the scene you'll
[22:13] heal the sick
[22:15] and i keep hearing that quote where
[22:17] brother brown says
[22:20] one unconfessed sin
[22:23] even brother branham talks about
[22:25] that in the prayer line
[22:27] he tells them to go get it right
[22:30] and remember there was a portion there
[22:32] of somebody that was
[22:33] that was sick and
[22:35] they had to go get something made right
[22:37] brother brown said or that devil is
[22:38] going to sit right there doesn't matter
[22:40] how much oil pour 55 gallon drums of oil
[22:42] all you want to and pray the prayer of
[22:44] faith that's fine
[22:46] but there's a lot of things that we
[22:48] go through in life
[22:50] that sometimes we forget about but i
[22:52] promise you one thing if god ever
[22:54] reminds you of something
[22:56] you better go do it
[22:58] um
[22:59] and this old boy has been a
[23:01] i have accused myself i don't have to be
[23:03] accused of others
[23:05] of being adamant about certain things in
[23:07] the scripture and about certain things
[23:09] in life
[23:10] and about certain preachers and one
[23:12] preacher i've been real hard on in the
[23:14] past and
[23:16] and
[23:17] i called him yesterday
[23:21] no monday sorry it was monday i get
[23:23] mixed up we were off on monday monday
[23:26] called him monday and i said brother
[23:29] i said there's something laying on my
[23:30] heart
[23:31] and i said i can't get an answer from
[23:32] god
[23:34] i said i've talked about bad about you
[23:38] for several years
[23:39] because of certain things you do you did
[23:42] and it was really none of my business
[23:44] i said i just want you to forgive me
[23:50] he said sure brother
[23:52] he said i got no problem
[23:54] he said actually he said
[23:56] bring your bible and come preach for me
[23:59] yeah i said brother
[24:02] but the moral i mean the story is
[24:06] yeah it was hard to find the number i
[24:08] didn't have the brother's number i mean
[24:10] he lived somewhere else and
[24:13] i had to find his number but i kept
[24:15] saying lord
[24:16] something's got to move
[24:19] when we clear this thing out of the way
[24:22] and that's the way you and i ought to do
[24:23] the same thing
[24:24] if we're struggling if we're having
[24:26] problems i don't care if brother brown
[24:28] said if it tears the height off your
[24:29] back
[24:32] to pick up the phone and call somebody
[24:34] that you may have wronged it don't
[24:35] matter if they knew about it because he
[24:37] didn't know i was talking about him i
[24:38] reckon i and and and
[24:41] wasn't any of my business he's not my
[24:43] pastor
[24:44] amen so that's the same way i want to be
[24:47] with any of you i want to apologize for
[24:49] anything i've said
[24:51] this hurt your feelings
[24:53] i don't want to hurt your feelings not
[24:54] anybody in this church i do not want to
[24:56] hurt their feelings i want us to grow up
[24:57] in god
[24:59] and and if you've made if god's made
[25:02] brother dale and myself the spiritual
[25:03] leadership of this church
[25:05] then we're supposed to act like it right
[25:09] and we're supposed to call out things
[25:10] when it needs to be called out
[25:12] but we're not supposed to talk about it
[25:14] in a group over here we're not supposed
[25:16] to talk about even to our wives at home
[25:18] there's nowhere in the bible and there's
[25:20] nowhere in the prophet's message where
[25:22] you're to discuss anything with your
[25:24] wife
[25:26] about problems going on in different
[25:27] places especially in the church
[25:30] everybody got that
[25:31] now i'm not accusing anybody i'm just
[25:33] telling you we i went through listen
[25:35] there's a you say well brother what are
[25:37] you doing you got to put it back to the
[25:39] word because brother brown said that
[25:40] demon will sit right there
[25:42] until you get that taken care of
[25:46] and brother john it was like
[25:48] it was like being born again all over
[25:50] again monday when i hung that phone up
[25:54] that thing lifted off of me
[25:57] and it was oh yeah it was hard
[26:02] but i'll never do it again by the grace
[26:04] of god
[26:05] each and every one of you
[26:07] stick a sock in my mouth if i start
[26:08] talking about i don't want to talk about
[26:10] nobody
[26:11] i don't want to hurt nobody's feelings
[26:13] now what we have to talk about here in
[26:14] this church different matter
[26:16] you misbehave in this church you're
[26:18] going to answer to brother dale
[26:20] so we have to we have to do that
[26:22] but as far as
[26:24] there should be nothing discussed
[26:25] outside of us brothers getting together
[26:27] and discussing it on our own
[26:30] because it'll lay there and that thing's
[26:31] laid there for several years
[26:35] and i paid for
[26:36] it but now
[26:40] we're moving on
[26:42] i'm not saying the problem's completely
[26:44] gone i feel like i got maybe a hernia
[26:48] down close to my groin and when i work
[26:50] and you know me i get up soon as i get
[26:51] finished with my mail route i'm i'm in
[26:54] i'm in the uh in the garden picking okra
[26:56] and everything else and
[26:58] but uh we're going on with god
[27:00] god said
[27:02] if you'll clear the slate
[27:06] so i've cleared my slate
[27:08] how about you
[27:10] can you pick up a phone and call
[27:11] somebody and say brother i'm sorry i've
[27:14] said something about you
[27:16] i've talked about you behind your back
[27:18] and i apologize because 99 of the time
[27:21] it's hearsay
[27:23] it's hearsay
[27:26] right
[27:27] and hearsay is what not admissible in a
[27:29] court of law
[27:31] only what eyewitness now if i witness
[27:33] something and you i witness something
[27:35] you have a right as a christian to say
[27:38] something either to your brother or to
[27:40] your sister but not to a crowd
[27:45] not to four or five people out in the
[27:46] parking lot or call somebody on the
[27:48] phone saying you know what brother
[27:49] so-and-so or sister
[27:51] what am i trying to do we're trying to
[27:53] clear a slate so we can get out of here
[27:54] we we've got so much what did paul tell
[27:57] us he said what
[27:58] get rid of the sin that so easily
[28:03] beset us
[28:04] easily so it's an easy thing to fall in
[28:07] this trap and i'm up here today in front
[28:09] of the world apologizing for
[28:11] for doing that and god forbid that i try
[28:14] to do it again because we should be
[28:17] shoulder to shoulder
[28:18] that's why that thing right there
[28:19] brother donny is up there right at the
[28:21] top brotherly kindness
[28:24] brother branham
[28:25] he was a man that had brotherly kindness
[28:27] you didn't know
[28:29] and i don't believe he talked about
[28:30] brothers i believe he pulled him off to
[28:31] the side and maybe spoke to him
[28:34] but i don't believe he was that way and
[28:36] i apologize for for being that way
[28:38] and i just
[28:40] i sleep better now
[28:42] i feel better just by a phone call
[28:45] didn't cost a dime
[28:48] nothing
[28:49] just a phone call
[28:50] say hey man
[28:52] i'm sorry we're brothers
[28:54] and then the brother just said hey bring
[28:55] your bible next time you're up this way
[28:58] preach for me
[28:59] so you see
[29:01] that was so easy
[29:02] but yet it's so hard
[29:05] what to admit you're wrong
[29:08] to confess your sins mama
[29:38] you know
[29:39] a white girl's name
[29:41] and because she just used a lot of
[29:43] blacks to use
[29:45] different names but anyway i told her i
[29:48] said
[29:48] well you've got a beautiful white girl's
[29:50] name
[29:51] and that haunted me and when i got sick
[29:55] i said we've got to find that number
[29:59] so finally we called and called this one
[30:01] and that know that nobody had johnson's
[30:03] number
[30:04] so finally they they got it and samuel
[30:07] called when i was sick he called and
[30:10] jonathan said well she did think
[30:12] something about it
[30:13] and said but she's all right now
[30:16] so they didn't come back to church after
[30:18] i said that
[30:19] so
[30:21] he said he said that they didn't come
[30:23] because it's too far but you know if
[30:26] it's whatever
[30:29] that's right
[30:30] right
[30:32] that's what we need to do we need to
[30:33] practice if you have anything i'll
[30:35] promise you if you're a child of god
[30:38] i'll promise you god is obligated to
[30:40] bring that to your attention and if you
[30:42] brush it off
[30:44] the iniquity is on you
[30:46] and you will deal with it
[30:48] now whether you go through dry places
[30:51] spiritually or whether he what he lifts
[30:54] off that thing and lets satan play with
[30:56] your body for a little while
[30:58] because see satan's a master at
[31:00] manipulation
[31:02] and he manipulates your body and he'll
[31:04] crawl in your mind and like i said
[31:06] before a couple sundays ago or whenever
[31:07] it was you know you you get this little
[31:09] thing set in here that says you know
[31:11] you're gonna die because you have this
[31:12] and you're gonna but you know what it's
[31:14] a lie it's unfounded it's
[31:16] you know let the doctors do their job
[31:18] and
[31:19] then let god do his job
[31:22] so
[31:23] that's what we're not gonna talk about
[31:24] that tonight but we're still on the two
[31:26] spirits but it does have something to do
[31:28] with those two spirits those two i'm not
[31:30] fighting an adulterous spirit to go out
[31:34] and commit adultery against my wife
[31:37] okay
[31:39] i'm fighting the spirit that's in here
[31:44] and i say in here because it's in all of
[31:46] us that's why i keep i want to keep
[31:47] going back and i'm going back and going
[31:49] back because i want you to understand
[31:50] one thing satan is not some demon that
[31:53] looks like a demon that we paint
[31:56] he's a pretty angel he's beautiful
[32:00] he is an angel of light
[32:02] he will tell you every truth except one
[32:05] word
[32:07] he can't hold that word word for word
[32:11] that's why then i believe when we talk
[32:12] about this this evening we get to it if
[32:14] we don't that's okay
[32:16] on where god said let there be
[32:20] light
[32:21] and there was light
[32:24] you know that light is a form of energy
[32:28] and energy can neither be created or
[32:30] destroyed
[32:33] so brother louise it wasn't that the
[32:34] switch got turned on
[32:36] that light always was there that light
[32:39] not the sun that light
[32:41] was always there
[32:44] because it's what it's energy from god
[32:47] almighty
[32:48] can't be destroyed
[32:51] and eat science even says it can only be
[32:53] changed from one form
[32:55] to another and that's exactly what he
[32:57] did he changed from one form to another
[33:00] to bring that light inside of me and you
[33:02] let's buy our heads
[33:04] the heavenly father thank you for this
[33:05] evening that you give us to be here
[33:08] we pray lord that you'll give us a
[33:10] rejuvenation of strength lord here in
[33:12] the middle of the week on wednesday
[33:14] night
[33:15] we fought the battle for monday and
[33:16] tuesday and part of the day today lord
[33:18] now we got another battle coming up
[33:21] but lord we win regardless
[33:26] of how many fall on the wayside
[33:27] regardless of how many put a sling
[33:29] around their arm and
[33:31] and
[33:31] as we say while uh just
[33:34] wobble their way to the end we made it
[33:37] because you told us
[33:39] that we
[33:40] would make it
[33:41] that there would be no weapon formed
[33:43] against us that would prosper
[33:46] and greater is he that's in us than he
[33:48] that's in the world father we ask you
[33:49] the lord truly to forgive us of our sins
[33:51] and our mistakes that we make in life
[33:54] we're human beings lord but we sh we
[33:55] have a spiritual rudder
[33:58] called the holy ghost inside of us that
[34:00] keeps us checked up
[34:03] that lord keeps us in the right path to
[34:05] where sometimes we might want to do
[34:07] something different
[34:08] and you feel that little check well
[34:10] thank you father for that little check
[34:13] because a bastard child
[34:15] will not get that kind of correction
[34:18] but lord a real child a real son and
[34:20] daughter of god will be corrected
[34:22] and brought back into the way as the
[34:24] prodigal son he was always a son
[34:27] but he had to be brought back he had to
[34:29] get to the lowest of low he had to be
[34:31] where
[34:33] sometimes we think you're not even there
[34:34] to listen lord but we know what you're
[34:36] doing
[34:37] you're training us up
[34:39] you're getting us ready lord to fight
[34:40] the greatest battle that's ever been
[34:42] fought
[34:43] and that's the battle between life and
[34:45] death
[34:46] father give us this day our daily bread
[34:48] be with us take care of us lead us in
[34:49] guide us by your holy spirit through
[34:50] this service
[34:52] you be the speaker lord be the active
[34:53] participant in jesus name
[34:56] amen
[34:57] so just take that little tidbit and see
[34:59] how it'll work
[35:00] it stings but you know what
[35:04] feels good afterwards
[35:06] it really feels good i mean it does
[35:09] you know why because the burden's been
[35:10] lifted
[35:12] i thought jesus said put your burdens on
[35:14] him
[35:15] but there's a way you've got to do that
[35:18] you can't just throw the burden on him
[35:19] and say well i'm not going to repent but
[35:20] here no there's a way to do everything
[35:24] all right there's a way to do everything
[35:26] and we as christians
[35:29] we should know how to live
[35:32] but we do forget
[35:34] i'll never forget i was reading a quote
[35:35] the other day and i'm gonna i'm gonna
[35:37] probably maybe maybe put it back in here
[35:40] brother branham you know he told us and
[35:41] i know you're standing but that's okay
[35:43] you've been sitting for 30 minutes you
[35:45] can stand for 30 minutes
[35:46] brother brown told us he said
[35:50] he said you know we got to this place
[35:52] that
[35:54] we look at things and
[35:58] we go wow you know that
[35:59] that happened that way and
[36:02] we have to realize that all things work
[36:04] together for good
[36:05] uh you know i don't know what brother
[36:07] joel's going through and all the
[36:08] different things that we are all going
[36:09] through
[36:12] but i read that scripture in isaiah 40
[36:14] and brother brown reads it many times he
[36:16] says they that wait
[36:18] upon the lord
[36:20] shall renew their strength
[36:22] they shall mount it with wings they that
[36:24] wait upon the lord amen so we as
[36:28] christians we should know how to do it
[36:29] but what brother bryan said let me get
[36:31] back to that brother bryan said he said
[36:32] there was a holy ghost veil over adam
[36:34] and eve we know that right because they
[36:35] were both naked and they didn't have any
[36:37] sexual desire everything was what pure
[36:40] all right well we have that same holy
[36:42] ghost veil but we have a flesh attached
[36:44] to it
[36:46] after the fall
[36:47] and brother branham says
[36:49] our mind gets clouded
[36:51] he said the earth got clouded
[36:55] after the fall and he said there's a
[36:57] murky fog that's going to stay there
[36:59] remember brother ryan said this thing's
[37:00] going to be sticky all the way to the
[37:01] end that's kind of what he's talking
[37:02] about that murky fog is what the fall
[37:04] that's that's where god can't come down
[37:07] and and change your body yet but but
[37:09] glory to god we're gonna we're getting
[37:11] there
[37:12] and man that cloud's gonna lift
[37:14] that cloud's gonna take off one day and
[37:16] as that cloud lifts we're gonna live
[37:18] with it
[37:18] amen but we gotta learn to live right
[37:20] down here amen
[37:24] brother brown said
[37:27] he said don't preach me a sermon live me
[37:28] one
[37:30] i've done a pitiful job and i apologize
[37:33] but you know what
[37:34] i'm not worried about the past anymore
[37:38] you just continue forward
[37:40] that's the same way you do don't look
[37:41] back just keep going on
[37:43] forgive me lord for what i did
[37:45] it was a test and a trial
[37:48] and if i'd have been a bastard child
[37:50] guess what
[37:51] he wouldn't have been there to correct
[37:52] me
[37:53] because you don't have to
[37:55] because you're not in the family amen so
[37:57] let's read first john the two spirits
[37:59] let there be part two maybe we'll get to
[38:01] this we're gonna fly through this pretty
[38:03] quick this time already took up
[38:05] too much time first john 4 verse 1 says
[38:08] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[38:10] the spirits whether they are of god
[38:13] because many false prophets are going
[38:15] out into the world hereby know you the
[38:17] spirit of god
[38:19] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[38:21] has come in the flesh
[38:23] is of god now we know we explain that
[38:24] that's not every drunk or any prostitute
[38:27] that will tell you that jesus is coming
[38:29] to flesh and that's not true
[38:30] that confet that word confettis is logos
[38:33] or
[38:34] the spoken word so that's what we are
[38:38] when you confess by what by that thing
[38:40] that's inside of you
[38:42] by that new birth that's inside of you
[38:44] if you confess that jesus
[38:47] is coming the flesh
[38:49] is of god
[38:51] and every spirit that confesses not that
[38:53] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[38:55] not of god and this is that spirit of
[38:57] antichrist now remember it's so close i
[39:01] keep wanting to go back to the beginning
[39:03] there stand satan and god and if you
[39:05] were to be an onlooker and a bystander
[39:08] you really couldn't i mean it wasn't
[39:09] like that satan standing there was with
[39:12] dark and gloomy and you know big claws
[39:15] and no he's a beautiful angel
[39:18] listen he took two-thirds of the angels
[39:21] of heaven that god created
[39:23] and told him a lie
[39:25] and they believed it
[39:27] because he was so beautiful he must be
[39:29] true
[39:30] anyway
[39:32] and every spirit that confesses not that
[39:33] jesus has come in the flesh is not of
[39:35] god and this is the spirit of antichrist
[39:37] wherever you have heard that it should
[39:39] come and even now already is in the
[39:41] world that was a.d 96
[39:43] year of god little children and have
[39:45] overcome them because greater is he thus
[39:47] in you
[39:48] than he that's in the world
[39:50] they are of the world therefore speak
[39:52] they of the world and the world heareth
[39:54] them
[39:55] like i said before how many
[39:56] conversations if you walk up to and that
[39:58] you used to be uh privy to and you could
[40:01] talk about the sports and the bretton
[40:03] and the gambling and what's on
[40:04] television what's on the news and what's
[40:05] on
[40:08] right now that should be all vague that
[40:10] should be nothing that concerns you that
[40:13] could be that should be something that
[40:14] you walk up and walk away from amen
[40:17] and the world heareth them we are of god
[40:20] he that knoweth god heareth us he that
[40:22] is not of god heareth not us hereby know
[40:25] we the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[40:27] error you may be seated in the lord at
[40:28] his blessing thank you for standing for
[40:29] a moment
[40:30] let's get through this real quick i
[40:32] don't want to get through too quick but
[40:34] i want these are just quotes that we
[40:35] quoted before till we get to
[40:38] genesis
[40:40] chapter 1 because remember genesis is
[40:42] the seed chapter of the bible
[40:45] everything began in genesis brother
[40:47] brown said the catholic church began in
[40:49] genesis
[40:52] christ antichrist if you've got
[40:54] antichrist that's where it started
[40:56] where did it start you know where the
[40:58] antichrist started at not on earth
[41:01] not in the garden of eden it started in
[41:03] heaven
[41:04] the antichrist came from christ
[41:08] that's the problem satan can't make his
[41:10] self christ but if you're born again
[41:12] today you are christ
[41:14] he can't stand that he hates that that
[41:17] he can't do what you do
[41:21] and he'll bore your brain won't he
[41:22] brother that he'll
[41:25] don't worry
[41:27] everything's gonna be all right
[41:28] ezekiel 28 verse 11 says moreover the
[41:30] word the lord came unto me saying son of
[41:33] man take up a lamentation
[41:35] upon the king of tyrus and say unto him
[41:37] thus saith the lord
[41:39] you all have to
[41:40] bear with long arms back there he's the
[41:42] only one i think is working so
[41:45] be with him
[41:46] brother anderson we good thus saith the
[41:48] lord god thou seedlest up to some look
[41:51] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[41:55] thou hast been in the garden the garden
[41:57] of god eden the garden of god
[42:02] two trees
[42:04] he was i mean he was as much welcome in
[42:06] the garden as anybody else was
[42:10] amen i mean right here he is he said
[42:12] he didn't now thou has been eaten the
[42:14] garden of god every precious stone was
[42:16] thy covering the sardis
[42:17] topaz diamond barrel onyx jasper
[42:20] sapphire emerald carbuncle and gold and
[42:22] brother joe sent me a thing and i didn't
[42:24] bring it i was going to bring it out
[42:25] here
[42:26] but that's only nine
[42:28] and there's 12
[42:30] or there's you know there's 12 of
[42:32] different lights because it's the 12
[42:34] tribes
[42:35] and there's three of them that satan
[42:36] can't be so i will maybe bring that
[42:38] later on but we didn't want to bring it
[42:40] tonight the sapphire the emerald
[42:42] carbuncle and gold the workmanship of
[42:43] thy tabrets and of thy pipes was
[42:46] prepared and then the day that thou was
[42:48] created
[42:49] god created lucifer
[42:52] god is the only creator
[42:54] no one else can create
[42:57] only god can create so he created a life
[43:03] and it was inhabited in a man named
[43:05] lucifer
[43:07] son of the morning
[43:09] beautiful
[43:10] worship angel god song leader
[43:14] why do you see all this now out in the
[43:16] world
[43:18] called fellowship centers and worship
[43:20] centers and
[43:21] and uh
[43:22] even heard this has been several years
[43:24] ago but when i was working at the
[43:25] poultry plant there was a brother come
[43:27] in and you know how brother brown said
[43:29] that the pentecostals used to just shout
[43:30] the whole service and then they shout so
[43:32] much the preacher didn't get to preach
[43:34] well this bat just it was the baptist
[43:36] and he said oh we had such an anointing
[43:38] this
[43:39] sunday and we sang for two and a half
[43:42] hours and said the preacher didn't even
[43:43] get to preach
[43:45] now folks you can't put
[43:47] you can't put singing over the word of
[43:50] god
[43:52] that means that have exalted satan above
[43:54] christ
[43:55] because christ is the word if you have
[43:57] no word there
[43:59] you can sit and sing all you want to
[44:01] all right but now look there's got to be
[44:03] a balance we know that brother brown
[44:05] give us the balance two or three songs
[44:07] and before service maybe a special then
[44:09] sing afterwards we know how that is and
[44:11] that's what we do but satan wants you to
[44:13] sing so much that you forget about the
[44:15] word of god
[44:18] that's his job
[44:20] and not not not rap music
[44:24] louise hip hop
[44:26] now
[44:27] he's closer than that
[44:31] he's closer than that
[44:32] that's what i want you to see
[44:35] he's so close he almost deceived
[44:39] me and you
[44:41] let's read demonology number one you
[44:42] know there's false there's a true and
[44:44] false of everything if i give you a
[44:45] dollar i say this is a good dollar and
[44:47] you look at it
[44:49] it'd have to look pretty much like a
[44:50] real dollar or you wouldn't believe it
[44:52] is that right so i have to be really a
[44:54] good imitation and if jesus said the two
[44:55] spirits in the last days would be so
[44:57] close
[44:58] until it would deceive the very elect if
[45:00] possible
[45:01] religious people
[45:03] now remember now there ain't nothing out
[45:05] there in them cold formal outside
[45:07] they have just a form of godliness you
[45:10] see
[45:11] but these two spirits are real spirits
[45:13] it'd be so close till it deceived the
[45:15] very leg how it was working side by side
[45:18] in the last days did jesus say that he
[45:20] did and then look by the opening of the
[45:22] seven seals brother adam saw how close
[45:25] it was
[45:27] when he saw that white horse rider come
[45:30] from where he was
[45:33] and then right off
[45:35] yeah praise god for riding off but i'd
[45:37] be scared to death to know he was right
[45:38] there at one time
[45:40] amen
[45:41] so there's your and then he's you know
[45:43] he after that he said you know
[45:45] everything comes into perspective the
[45:47] denial hawaii was so much against
[45:48] organized religion and why he was so
[45:50] much against that religious system why
[45:52] it was an antichrist system
[45:55] they hate to say that but it is that's
[45:57] what it is one and we can be the same
[45:59] thing
[46:02] right
[46:03] an exposition of the seven church ages
[46:04] this is one we are always going to read
[46:06] because i believe it is a mandate
[46:10] to this church right now
[46:13] not the church's past
[46:15] this church sitting here today breathing
[46:18] as hard as we can through these masks
[46:22] this is a mandate that me and you
[46:25] remember christ in the true church
[46:29] i'm going to decide that i'm going to be
[46:31] in the true church
[46:32] okay that's a decision that you have to
[46:35] make
[46:37] christ in the true church is a
[46:38] continuation of the book of acts but the
[46:41] book of revelation shows how that the
[46:43] antichrist spirit would come into the
[46:45] church
[46:48] and defile it right
[46:51] make it lukewarm
[46:54] formal
[46:55] and powerless
[46:57] see we lost our power by just what i was
[46:59] talking about we how can you use the
[47:01] power of the word of god when you got
[47:02] that one little thing right there
[47:07] you know
[47:08] in between one little thing
[47:11] brother brown said unconfessed sin one
[47:13] unconfessed sin can make the whole
[47:14] church fail why because god can't move
[47:18] he'll move to a certain spot and then he
[47:19] stops
[47:21] but he's waiting on us he's waiting on
[47:22] us to break that thing
[47:25] so maybe we can have a revival maybe we
[47:26] couldn't have one before maybe we can
[47:28] have one now i mean i'm saying we i'm
[47:30] saying me
[47:31] can have one because remember it's a
[47:33] personal revival
[47:35] because you sure do feel a lot better
[47:37] because satan's been for about two weeks
[47:38] he's been banging on his flesh not so
[47:41] much where you can see it
[47:43] but what's the worst sickness in the
[47:44] world
[47:48] right here
[47:50] that's where the greatest battle has
[47:51] ever fought not here
[47:53] this thing's just getting older and it's
[47:55] got aches and pains but when satan gets
[47:56] inside your
[47:58] brain and starts a
[48:00] merry-go-round
[48:03] that's the worst thing in the world you
[48:04] can have
[48:07] and i've never been depressed and you
[48:08] know i've never been depressed i've
[48:10] never had depression
[48:12] but i have never had anxiety either but
[48:14] now i can't say that i've had an ain't a
[48:16] couple of anxiety attacks and it ain't
[48:17] fun
[48:18] it's an attack
[48:21] i don't know why i'm on this but it's an
[48:22] attack
[48:24] and it attacks your mind it attacks and
[48:26] you know what
[48:27] the best thing you can do is is do what
[48:29] i said
[48:30] get all that out of the way but then you
[48:32] gotta read your bible
[48:34] you got to study you got to come to
[48:36] church why do you think god ain't moving
[48:38] in your life
[48:41] we look out here and you're not in
[48:42] church
[48:45] i'm just telling you what the bible says
[48:49] amen all right
[48:54] one unconfessed sin
[48:57] it exposes satan revealing his words see
[48:59] this is exposing satan you say oh bro
[49:01] wait you're just telling us about your
[49:02] life no this is exposing a demon
[49:07] and there's not just one of them
[49:11] many of us have been through this
[49:13] and may be going through it or maybe
[49:15] fixing to go through it
[49:18] but if you can't get anything from god
[49:20] first thing to do is start checking your
[49:22] life
[49:24] is everything okay
[49:27] is everything all
[49:28] right one unconfessed sin
[49:33] it exposes satan revealing his works
[49:35] attempted destruction of god's people
[49:37] and the discrediting of god's word now
[49:38] he's not going to tell you god's word's
[49:40] wrong
[49:41] he's going to discredit
[49:44] amen
[49:46] this antichrist spirit is so close till
[49:48] he quotes the word he quotes quotes
[49:52] he brings you
[49:54] the word
[49:55] [Music]
[49:56] letter but where's the power behind it
[50:00] he fights it he cannot stand it he knows
[50:03] that if the people get the true
[50:05] revelation of the true church
[50:08] and what she is not a church out there
[50:10] not a church with a building a church
[50:15] what she is and what she stands for
[50:19] that she can do the greater works
[50:22] she will be an invincible army
[50:27] if they get a true revelation of the two
[50:29] spirits within the framework
[50:32] what is framework this building has a
[50:34] framework brother gary krantz put a lot
[50:37] of this framework up what it's inside
[50:39] the wall
[50:44] but it's inside this church
[50:46] that wall that framework is right here
[50:49] the framework is right here
[50:51] remember this is framed
[50:53] by the fall
[50:55] but that thing inside of you is not
[50:57] right
[50:58] now if you're not born again it's one
[51:00] and the same
[51:02] and you're lost
[51:04] but if you're born again
[51:06] you've got one spirit in here and you've
[51:08] got another spirit beating it out
[51:09] beating you out here
[51:11] amen
[51:12] that all right
[51:15] listen there's holy spirit none holy
[51:17] spirit
[51:18] a lot of things i do are unholy
[51:21] you saw no now we ain't talking about
[51:23] cussing drink we're just talking about
[51:25] doing little things
[51:28] little things little white foxes
[51:31] that spoil the vine
[51:34] but these two spirits
[51:37] if they get a true revelation of the two
[51:39] spirits within the framework of the
[51:41] christian church
[51:44] we're not fighting methodists and
[51:45] baptists and pentecostals and message
[51:46] churches and people that don't preach
[51:48] right and people that says we need to
[51:50] listen to we're not fighting them people
[51:54] we're fighting the spirit that motivates
[51:57] those people
[51:59] listen that's why i said before don't
[52:01] cry out against a person
[52:03] cry out against the spirit that's
[52:05] motivating that person
[52:07] that's my brother branham with that
[52:10] who was it the the preacher that just
[52:12] said off fully i'm going to drink beer
[52:14] and
[52:15] uh whoever he was you know brother brown
[52:17] didn't say well now bless god he's lost
[52:19] he's out of here
[52:21] no
[52:23] he told us what happened
[52:25] he even talked to the guy i believe
[52:28] but he said he died about six months
[52:29] later because he wouldn't now see would
[52:31] he have turned because remember i
[52:32] remember one time brother branham was
[52:34] talking about somebody that had left the
[52:36] fold
[52:38] you go oh
[52:40] but he said what'd he say
[52:42] but now i went and got him
[52:44] and he's safely back in the fold
[52:46] you see that's that's a backslider
[52:49] that's somebody that's done wrong and he
[52:51] went out there and said brother god
[52:52] bless you
[52:53] not
[52:55] cast the demons on top of him go out
[52:57] there with what brotherly kindness
[52:59] brotherly love that's what we're going
[53:00] to work on we got to work on that
[53:02] because it's right there at the top of
[53:03] that pyramid we need to work on that the
[53:05] framework of the christian church and by
[53:07] god's spirit discern now see there
[53:09] discern
[53:11] and withstand the antichrist spirit
[53:13] satan will be powerless before her
[53:16] forget about politics forget about the
[53:18] economy forget about all this stuff
[53:20] that's going on that's not the
[53:27] the antichrist you need to worry about
[53:28] someone you're going home with tonight
[53:30] and i ain't talking about your wife or
[53:32] your husband
[53:35] everybody go looking
[53:38] he has be he will be definitely thwarted
[53:41] today is when christ withstood now you
[53:43] see that prophet he put us in a position
[53:45] to where he satan came to jesus and
[53:48] jesus defeated him by what
[53:50] the word
[53:51] defeated by the word just quoted the
[53:53] word back to him
[53:55] just quoted and satan left him
[53:58] number three an exposition of the seven
[53:59] church ages
[54:03] he's reading in jude three
[54:06] beloveds when i give all diligence to
[54:08] write unto you the common salvation is
[54:09] needful for me to write unto you and
[54:11] exhort you you should earnestly contend
[54:13] for the faith which was once delivered
[54:15] unto the saints
[54:17] for there are certain men this is part
[54:19] of the scripture
[54:20] not saints but this is brother brown's
[54:22] quote crept in unawares these have not
[54:24] come into the foe by means of the door
[54:26] and are therefore robbers
[54:28] who were before of old ordained to this
[54:30] condemnation
[54:32] by foreknowledge
[54:34] ungodly men now not ungodly men man
[54:37] gonna walk into this place and be a
[54:39] pervert
[54:40] you understand what i'm saying that's
[54:42] why i keep going over and over this
[54:43] again we're waiting on some guy to walk
[54:45] in and try to pervert you
[54:48] no
[54:50] it's a spirit and he's slick
[54:53] and he sly
[54:54] and he slides in
[54:57] a snake
[54:58] slides
[55:01] slithers
[55:02] that's right
[55:03] he gets right up beside you ungodly men
[55:05] turning the grace of our god into
[55:06] lasciviousness and denying the only lord
[55:09] god in our lord jesus christ you know if
[55:11] you deny the word you deny god
[55:15] you deny the word you deny god
[55:18] these are feast spots in your feast of
[55:20] charity when they feast with you
[55:23] now i didn't make that a time i didn't
[55:24] make that bold letters that come out of
[55:26] the church age book with bold letters
[55:29] because they're feasting with us feeding
[55:30] themselves without fear now then again i
[55:33] don't want anybody to say oh brother
[55:34] wait he's talking about somebody in this
[55:35] building i'm not i'm talking about a
[55:36] spirit
[55:39] and it takes many forms
[55:42] it cannot be denied now this is the
[55:44] quote
[55:46] it cannot be denied in the face of these
[55:47] scriptures that the true church and the
[55:50] false church are intertwined
[55:56] having been planted together
[55:58] where was it planted garden of
[56:00] eden there's with a division it wasn't
[56:03] planted on earth we ain't talking about
[56:05] no natural seed
[56:07] spiritual
[56:08] the problem is
[56:10] satan had to come and pervert
[56:13] what god created he couldn't create a
[56:16] perverted seed
[56:19] god said all souls are mine
[56:21] satan can't create one but he sure can
[56:23] pervert it
[56:24] amen
[56:26] he did that for me for 30 something
[56:27] years i'm pretty much
[56:30] whatever whatever you were too he
[56:32] perverted it for a good long period of
[56:34] time maybe some of you not but some of
[56:36] us were just a little bit harder headed
[56:38] and it took just a little bit longer but
[56:40] you know what we came at the time we're
[56:41] supposed to come
[56:43] all right so now we're going back to the
[56:45] back before the beginning as we were
[56:47] talking about before
[56:48] because we got to get back we got to get
[56:50] to earth
[56:52] to make this come to manifestation
[56:54] because there listen again there is not
[56:56] two seed lines
[56:58] natural right that's right right
[57:00] everybody got that same man
[57:02] there has never been two seed lines
[57:05] natural that god said i hate that one i
[57:07] love that one
[57:10] natural you hear what i said not there
[57:12] is no natural listen we're all born dead
[57:17] once
[57:19] the beast did what he did
[57:21] i say satan or lucifer vicariously threw
[57:24] the beast made him do that
[57:27] because he didn't do it he'd been living
[57:29] for years and years and years and never
[57:30] touched eve
[57:31] amen
[57:33] but when satan what perverted him
[57:37] into planting a natural seed he thought
[57:39] he could do something with that
[57:41] well
[57:43] he's not a creator
[57:47] that's what stumped the old devil when
[57:48] cain was born
[57:51] god had to give him a soul
[57:54] god had delivered he give cain a soul
[57:57] you think the devil did no the devil
[57:59] can't create
[58:01] god gave cain a soul now what perverted
[58:04] it
[58:05] cain perverted it or
[58:07] what cain did
[58:09] perverted it
[58:10] all right
[58:12] because what was the situation between
[58:13] cain and abel
[58:14] one was righteous one was not it was
[58:16] because of what they did not listen they
[58:18] both came out of the same womb
[58:24] eve
[58:25] both of them came out of the same womb
[58:28] one was a illegal act
[58:31] and one would have been a act whatever
[58:33] you want to say later on had adam and
[58:36] eve got together i don't believe sex was
[58:38] involved in the original
[58:40] except in the animal kingdom
[58:43] we weren't supposed to come by say
[58:46] sex is our problem
[58:47] all right
[58:49] so let's go number four questions and
[58:51] answers on genesis
[58:54] everybody all right
[58:56] i want us to cast light i want us to be
[58:58] illuminated by these
[59:01] by us
[59:02] have you ever done this before have you
[59:04] ever tried brother brandon was the
[59:05] greatest storyteller and i don't mean by
[59:08] telling stories lies i mean the greatest
[59:10] storyteller ever
[59:13] he can make you think you were standing
[59:15] in the garden of eden right beside adam
[59:17] and eve
[59:19] he'd make you think he was on the
[59:21] mountain with moses
[59:23] and he told it so slow till you didn't
[59:25] miss a detail
[59:27] thank god he was southern
[59:30] yeah
[59:30] he was a little bit northern we might
[59:32] have to rewind a few a few times but
[59:34] he spoke my language brother donnie i
[59:36] don't know about y'all but he told it
[59:37] slow
[59:38] but remember do you know why
[59:41] because he caught the mind of god
[59:45] he was a prophet i know that but you and
[59:47] i can catch the mind of god
[59:50] and you can just i can literally see
[59:55] someone standing in nothingness
[59:58] and saying let there be
[1:00:01] but i can also see a form standing there
[1:00:03] beside of him called lucifer
[1:00:06] because he created him first
[1:00:08] because he's his right hand man right
[1:00:10] so there's lucifer for the whole time
[1:00:12] the whole time god created heaven and
[1:00:14] earth
[1:00:17] stars
[1:00:18] everything he was there
[1:00:21] he didn't create him later on down the
[1:00:23] line he created him as right hand man
[1:00:25] because
[1:00:25] satan was going to help him not help him
[1:00:28] create
[1:00:29] but he said i made you perfect
[1:00:32] i anointed you
[1:00:34] i made you beautiful
[1:00:36] something to admire
[1:00:38] that's why john admired that
[1:00:40] church in the book of revelations
[1:00:43] brother brown said the angel had to turn
[1:00:44] him away from that beautiful church that
[1:00:46] was the
[1:00:48] all right
[1:00:49] questions and answers on genesis
[1:00:52] the first creation was god himself
[1:00:54] the now of god came to logos
[1:00:56] which was the son of god then out of the
[1:00:58] logos which was the word
[1:01:00] beginning was the word word was with god
[1:01:02] and where was with god
[1:01:03] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:01:05] among us
[1:01:06] out of the logos came forth the man
[1:01:08] who's he talking about to genesis 1 26
[1:01:10] ma'am everybody okay with that
[1:01:13] all right
[1:01:13] because the genesis 1 26 man is just an
[1:01:16] extension of god it's not a different
[1:01:18] person it's not another creation it's
[1:01:20] not something separate from god
[1:01:22] it's that light that we're talking about
[1:01:25] that doesn't it's not created or
[1:01:27] destroyed it can only be changed from
[1:01:29] one form to the other
[1:01:31] so god changed his form
[1:01:36] just like jesus christ
[1:01:38] is almighty god
[1:01:40] god just changed his form he didn't
[1:01:41] change his person he didn't change his
[1:01:44] personality listen if jesus would have
[1:01:46] come just a regular normal person he'd
[1:01:48] have been just like me and you he'd have
[1:01:49] fought this
[1:01:50] word because in your humanity and in
[1:01:53] your
[1:01:54] fallen condition we fight this word you
[1:01:57] say no i don't yeah you do
[1:01:59] every time you did what you did you
[1:02:00] fight the word of god
[1:02:02] i'm talking about when you were not born
[1:02:03] again all right
[1:02:06] so the first creation was god himself
[1:02:07] and now the god out of god came to logos
[1:02:10] what was it not another god it was just
[1:02:11] god stepped over now remember
[1:02:13] as we said before
[1:02:16] and i'll read it here in just a little
[1:02:17] while
[1:02:18] light travels at 186
[1:02:21] 000
[1:02:22] miles per second
[1:02:27] do you know that the sun goes down eight
[1:02:29] minutes
[1:02:32] before we see it go down
[1:02:35] it rises six minutes
[1:02:37] because it takes six minutes to go 93
[1:02:40] million miles like traveling at 186 000
[1:02:43] miles per second now second i'm talking
[1:02:45] about
[1:02:47] but it takes six minutes that's how far
[1:02:48] that sun is
[1:02:50] from the earth it takes six minutes for
[1:02:51] that light to get here because light
[1:02:53] travels listen light's just not here
[1:02:55] light travels
[1:02:57] light is light has a origin and it
[1:03:00] travels
[1:03:01] oh you ought to see something
[1:03:03] you ought to see something with that
[1:03:06] light originates from somewhere and it
[1:03:08] travels
[1:03:11] and it gives off photons and neutrons
[1:03:14] and lord it's all kind of things and
[1:03:15] things banging into each other and and
[1:03:18] all that if you want to study it but i
[1:03:19] don't have time we just need to stay in
[1:03:21] the spiritual aspect because remember
[1:03:23] there was an s-o-n before there was an
[1:03:26] s-u-n
[1:03:27] amen there was an s-o-n before there was
[1:03:30] an s-u-n
[1:03:32] because it gave light first
[1:03:34] the s-u-n gave light later
[1:03:38] all right here we go
[1:03:42] so ezekiel 28 verse 11 says
[1:03:44] son of man take up a lamentation
[1:03:48] and the king of tires we already read
[1:03:49] this before
[1:03:51] and he's beautiful
[1:03:55] well thou was created thou art the
[1:03:56] anointed let's go down to verse 14. thou
[1:03:58] art the anointed cherub now who anointed
[1:04:00] him
[1:04:03] god anointed him
[1:04:05] the original anointing that lucifer
[1:04:07] received was from god because he can't
[1:04:09] create
[1:04:12] so we so he had to get this anointing
[1:04:14] from god
[1:04:15] but once he got this anointing
[1:04:19] can you imagine
[1:04:22] being god
[1:04:24] you say no but could you imagine though
[1:04:27] that anything you think of
[1:04:29] anything
[1:04:31] brother brown said if god said let there
[1:04:34] be fleas he said within five seconds
[1:04:36] they would be 30 miles all around this
[1:04:39] world and he'd destroy this world with
[1:04:41] fleas in five seconds
[1:04:46] but it's all under control
[1:04:49] right he said what he's saying brother
[1:04:51] wayne he he god has limitless power
[1:04:55] but he's decided see god made a choice
[1:05:00] to limit himself
[1:05:03] he's a father and he's all these
[1:05:04] different things but he had to limit
[1:05:06] himself just like you know what
[1:05:09] why
[1:05:10] i'm not gonna scare you
[1:05:12] but why
[1:05:15] oh that's why does that not keep going
[1:05:17] that's light
[1:05:20] why didn't that just keep going
[1:05:22] there was no power behind it
[1:05:25] but take somebody like god almighty
[1:05:28] you can't turn him off and on
[1:05:31] he stays on all the time
[1:05:34] amen and he just keeps going do you know
[1:05:37] i was reading just a few minutes ago
[1:05:39] that it takes 40
[1:05:41] 000
[1:05:42] years
[1:05:45] 40 000 years man has somehow figured
[1:05:47] this out it takes 40 000 years to
[1:05:49] whatever we see in the sun
[1:05:52] whatever emanates from the inside of
[1:05:54] that core of that sun photons and
[1:05:56] molecules and all these different things
[1:05:58] it takes 40 000 years for it to get to
[1:06:00] the surface
[1:06:01] to light the sun
[1:06:06] 40
[1:06:07] 000
[1:06:08] years
[1:06:10] you think god's got patience
[1:06:13] he created that thing a long time ago
[1:06:16] and it's been given sunlight for at
[1:06:17] least 6 000 years
[1:06:21] it's never not come up
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:27] and that's a created thing
[1:06:30] but let's see where it came from here if
[1:06:32] we ever get to it brother louise we'll
[1:06:33] get to it
[1:06:34] verse number five look at number five
[1:06:36] now wait a minute that was perfect in
[1:06:38] our ways from the day that was created
[1:06:40] till iniquity was found in thee what is
[1:06:43] iniquity doing something knowing you
[1:06:46] shouldn't or go and do something that
[1:06:48] you know you shouldn't do and you do it
[1:06:49] anyway that is a hideous sin to god
[1:06:51] that's iniquity all right that's why the
[1:06:54] mystery of iniquity under the first seal
[1:06:55] was is that that thing stayed right here
[1:06:58] if you didn't get the baptism of the
[1:06:59] holy ghost to get that thing to ride off
[1:07:01] from you all right
[1:07:02] thou art the anointed cherub that coveth
[1:07:04] i have set thee so
[1:07:07] god said him right there
[1:07:10] now satan
[1:07:11] wasn't as what i said before god's got
[1:07:13] this unlimited power why didn't he just
[1:07:15] look over and go
[1:07:16] i think i'll make another one
[1:07:19] and
[1:07:21] no he wanted to use that one
[1:07:24] because when god does something he does
[1:07:25] it perfect right you say satan was
[1:07:28] perfect i just read to you the bible
[1:07:30] says it was perfect
[1:07:32] somewhere in here one of them that says
[1:07:34] thou were perfect
[1:07:37] it's in there somewhere it's maybe it's
[1:07:39] in that other one
[1:07:41] right here
[1:07:43] when thou was created there are the
[1:07:44] anointed cherub that covereth i have set
[1:07:46] thee so that was upon the holy mountain
[1:07:48] of god thou has walked up and down in
[1:07:51] the midst of the stones of fire
[1:07:53] thou what there it is thou was perfect
[1:07:56] in thy ways from the day that thou was
[1:07:59] created until iniquity
[1:08:01] was found in thee
[1:08:03] that's right oh my
[1:08:05] number five
[1:08:07] did you know that in heaven that the
[1:08:08] devil was god's right-hand man
[1:08:11] in the beginning that lucifer the son of
[1:08:12] the morning was given power
[1:08:14] and the reason that he brought sin into
[1:08:16] the world he was able to take something
[1:08:18] that god had created lucifer is sitting
[1:08:21] there and he's going wait a minute i
[1:08:22] can't use the stars
[1:08:24] i can't use the moon
[1:08:26] i can't use the trees
[1:08:29] i can't use the grass
[1:08:32] i can't touch that tree of life
[1:08:36] but i got a little knowledge
[1:08:39] because i see the animals procreating
[1:08:43] by what god told them every seed would
[1:08:45] bring forth of its kind
[1:08:47] everybody got that say amen
[1:08:50] that's what satan entered in right there
[1:08:51] he said huh
[1:08:52] i think i can get to the human race that
[1:08:54] way and that's exactly what it did
[1:08:56] listen we're not dealing with a second
[1:08:58] class we're not dealing with a with a
[1:09:00] second grader
[1:09:01] we're dealing with somebody that has
[1:09:03] perfected his skill over thousands and
[1:09:05] maybe even hundreds of thousands of
[1:09:06] years
[1:09:09] i don't think we can defeat him
[1:09:12] but god can
[1:09:16] all right let's go back um
[1:09:19] and the reason that he brought sin into
[1:09:21] the world he was able to take something
[1:09:23] that god had created what the animals or
[1:09:25] the beasts and pervert it back into an
[1:09:27] evil thing which started all this
[1:09:29] trouble in the beginning then god before
[1:09:31] the foundation of the world was ever
[1:09:32] laid when he seen what satan done for
[1:09:35] knowledge
[1:09:37] he was co-worker partly equal with him
[1:09:40] only satan could not create
[1:09:43] god is the only creator but satan took
[1:09:45] something
[1:09:48] that god created and perverted it back
[1:09:50] into something else
[1:09:52] evil let's go to revelation 12 verse 7
[1:09:54] and there was war in heaven mike and his
[1:09:56] angels fought against the dragon now who
[1:09:58] is michael michael is christ it's just
[1:10:00] god in another form like i said before
[1:10:02] he runs faster than the 186 thousand
[1:10:05] miles per second god you know why
[1:10:07] because he created that anything that
[1:10:09] created that's got to be faster than
[1:10:10] that
[1:10:12] oh what a mighty god we serve
[1:10:14] when he can be standing in one place
[1:10:16] right here tonight speaking to you and
[1:10:17] he can be in the jungles of africa
[1:10:21] visiting them with the baptism of the
[1:10:22] holy ghost the same god
[1:10:24] he didn't send another god over there
[1:10:27] it's the same god but he's traveled over
[1:10:29] there so fast
[1:10:32] that's why i believe that god let
[1:10:34] brother branham see these dimensions and
[1:10:36] see how fast they're they're just faster
[1:10:38] things listen
[1:10:40] when god came into this dimension he had
[1:10:42] to slow down after the fall he had to
[1:10:45] slow down
[1:10:47] because we're at a crawl and he's just
[1:10:49] like travel the universe
[1:10:51] even brother brown remember he told us
[1:10:52] he said you've got the creative power to
[1:10:54] you what go create a world they didn't
[1:10:56] say you needed a
[1:10:59] jet or a
[1:11:01] or a rocket to get there he said create
[1:11:04] a world and go live on it what boom boom
[1:11:08] right here because that's what's going
[1:11:10] to change us
[1:11:11] we don't realize what we already got not
[1:11:13] what's coming
[1:11:15] it's what we've already got
[1:11:18] we've just it's so
[1:11:20] we got so much fog around it
[1:11:24] it's a foggy place
[1:11:27] but let there be light
[1:11:30] all right you okay
[1:11:32] the right-hand man where we at
[1:11:34] revelation there was war in heaven
[1:11:35] michael and his angel fought against the
[1:11:36] dragon now kids and adults they were not
[1:11:39] up there like i said before they weren't
[1:11:42] having a wwe
[1:11:44] world wrestling federation
[1:11:46] or um mma
[1:11:47] knocked down dragout
[1:11:49] no it was the word
[1:11:52] satan preached his word
[1:11:55] michael preached his it was the spirits
[1:11:58] this fight today we're not fighting each
[1:11:59] other you're fighting a spirit
[1:12:01] you can be fighting a spirit
[1:12:04] and you don't even know it
[1:12:08] i quote you brother brown said told that
[1:12:09] brother he said you fought your way here
[1:12:11] to this meeting
[1:12:13] the brother said i just got in the car
[1:12:15] and come to work come to the meeting why
[1:12:17] brother brown saw in that other
[1:12:18] dimension
[1:12:20] the fight that was going on the
[1:12:21] spiritual battle that was going on for
[1:12:24] that guy to get here
[1:12:25] listen this whole listen don't you think
[1:12:27] for one second
[1:12:29] for one second
[1:12:31] that satan's not after you
[1:12:34] he has sent a demon to personally be
[1:12:36] with you just like god sent an angel for
[1:12:38] you to be and you know what they're
[1:12:39] doing they're fighting what by words
[1:12:42] my words is what condemned me not my
[1:12:45] physically beating the person up or
[1:12:47] getting beat up
[1:12:49] sometimes that's too easy
[1:12:51] but you see those scars because you see
[1:12:53] it outside but what about those insiders
[1:12:55] you can't see
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:58] we got to get rid of those things folks
[1:12:59] it'll kill us
[1:13:01] and prevail not neither was their place
[1:13:03] found anymore in heaven
[1:13:06] and the great dragon was cast out that
[1:13:08] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:13:11] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[1:13:12] cast out into the earth and his angels
[1:13:14] were cast out with him
[1:13:16] isaiah 14 verse 12
[1:13:18] how art thou fallen from heaven oh
[1:13:20] lucifer son of the morning now what is
[1:13:22] the morning dark no the morning sunlight
[1:13:25] how are thou cut down to the ground
[1:13:27] which didest weaken the nations for thou
[1:13:29] hast said in thine heart
[1:13:31] i will descend into heaven i will exalt
[1:13:33] my throne now listen
[1:13:36] there's we got to the difference like we
[1:13:37] were talking about with nathan and cora
[1:13:39] and
[1:13:40] and jethro
[1:13:43] because god told us
[1:13:46] we could sit on his throne
[1:13:49] see the difference
[1:13:50] god told us we could
[1:13:52] god told us we were gods god told us we
[1:13:55] were little creators god told us we were
[1:13:58] little messiahs
[1:14:01] but satan says i'm going to exalt myself
[1:14:06] for thou hast said in thy heart i will
[1:14:08] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[1:14:10] throne above the stars of god i will sit
[1:14:14] also upon the mount of the congregation
[1:14:18] hmm
[1:14:20] could be right here
[1:14:21] this is the congregation we're gathered
[1:14:23] together today right
[1:14:25] okay now watch
[1:14:28] and there was a question one time and
[1:14:29] i've answered it before let's answer it
[1:14:31] again that day at calvary 1960 brother
[1:14:33] bryan says sin did not start on the
[1:14:34] earth
[1:14:36] sin started in heaven lucifer the devil
[1:14:38] was a condemned creature for his
[1:14:39] disobedience before he ever struck the
[1:14:41] earth sin began in heaven where god put
[1:14:43] the angels and so forth upon the same
[1:14:46] basis that he puts human beings on now
[1:14:48] listen they can't be saved
[1:14:53] because what about lucifer's angels
[1:14:56] no they're condemned
[1:15:00] but who's going to judge them
[1:15:02] you and i are going to judge them
[1:15:05] we're going to judge eve i took that
[1:15:07] scripture out for to save time but the
[1:15:09] bible tells us we will even judge angels
[1:15:14] where god put the angels and so forth
[1:15:16] upon the same basis that he put human
[1:15:17] beings knowledge the tree of knowledge
[1:15:19] tree of life and the tree of knowledge
[1:15:21] where man could take his choice and when
[1:15:23] lucifer was given the preeminence to
[1:15:25] make his choice he wanted something
[1:15:27] better than god had
[1:15:28] that started the trouble
[1:15:30] number seven greatest battle ever fought
[1:15:32] this great first battle was ever fought
[1:15:35] began in heaven when michael and his
[1:15:36] angels fought against lucifer and his
[1:15:38] angels
[1:15:39] it first started the first battle was in
[1:15:41] heaven so sin did not originate on earth
[1:15:42] it originated in heaven
[1:15:44] and then it was thrown down from heaven
[1:15:46] cast out of heaven to the earth and fell
[1:15:48] on human beings
[1:15:52] all right now these these angels did not
[1:15:54] become human beings
[1:15:55] they can't do that
[1:15:57] brother branham tells you that many many
[1:15:59] many many times and i agree 100
[1:16:03] no
[1:16:04] but you let it anoint you why because it
[1:16:06] comes from the great anointed cherub
[1:16:08] he's anointed his imps and his disciples
[1:16:12] and they go out and anoint you you see
[1:16:14] what see god can get down in your soul
[1:16:16] and change you satan came
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:20] it can pervert what god's already got
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:23] make you do things you don't even want
[1:16:25] to do
[1:16:26] amen
[1:16:32] then the battle from angels became human
[1:16:34] battles
[1:16:35] and satan come to destroy god's creation
[1:16:37] what god had created to be for himself
[1:16:39] he had satan came to destroy this that's
[1:16:42] what his purpose was was to destroy it
[1:16:43] then the battle began here on earth
[1:16:46] began in us
[1:16:47] in us
[1:16:49] and has been raging every sense
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:53] second corinthians verse 11 of chapter
[1:16:55] 11 verse 13 for such a false apostle
[1:16:58] deceitful workers transforming
[1:17:00] themselves into the apostles of christ
[1:17:02] and no marvel for satan himself is
[1:17:05] transformed into an angel of light
[1:17:10] but now remember we got to put a few
[1:17:11] scriptures together because jesus told
[1:17:13] the disciples he said if that light in
[1:17:16] you
[1:17:17] be darkness
[1:17:19] how great is that darkness
[1:17:22] in other words if you think you're right
[1:17:24] and you think your light is right
[1:17:27] and it's not
[1:17:29] how great is that darkness why because
[1:17:30] you're so dark you think you're standing
[1:17:32] in the light
[1:17:34] but it's the darkest time you've ever
[1:17:35] been in him
[1:17:36] is that all right
[1:17:38] for satan himself is transformed into an
[1:17:40] angel of light therefore there's no
[1:17:41] great thing if his ministers also be
[1:17:44] transformed as the ministers of
[1:17:46] righteousness whose end shall be
[1:17:47] according
[1:17:48] to their works now we've seen many times
[1:17:50] before
[1:17:52] we still see it now
[1:17:54] how that satan is trying to destroy the
[1:17:56] ministry look at all the if you've got
[1:17:58] your bibles you can turn to genesis 1 or
[1:18:00] we'll read it here we're finally getting
[1:18:01] there louise
[1:18:04] genesis 1 verse 1
[1:18:06] and we'll start there and try to break
[1:18:07] this down if you don't mind i want you
[1:18:09] to just be bear with me i've been
[1:18:10] thinking about this and
[1:18:12] and
[1:18:14] when we look at things
[1:18:19] that doesn't have we don't have quotes
[1:18:21] for
[1:18:23] yeah we might be
[1:18:24] presuming but when we can take the bible
[1:18:28] and the quotes
[1:18:30] and then we let the holy ghost put it
[1:18:32] together for us
[1:18:35] and you eliminate things that it can't
[1:18:37] be like brother dale said that you know
[1:18:38] you go and it's true if you'd go through
[1:18:40] the process of elimination
[1:18:42] do that if you're sitting there sick
[1:18:44] today if you're sitting here and there's
[1:18:45] some problem going on in your life go
[1:18:47] through the process of elimination
[1:18:50] do i pray
[1:18:51] do i read my bible
[1:18:53] do i go to church every time the doors
[1:18:55] are open people just people lather
[1:18:57] around in their sin and they go
[1:19:00] well i don't know what's wrong with me i
[1:19:02] don't know what's wrong with me
[1:19:04] ain't been in church in three weeks
[1:19:06] haven't read your bible in a month
[1:19:17] but i believe the message
[1:19:21] but i believe the message that's the
[1:19:22] that's the most damning quote
[1:19:26] but i believe the message
[1:19:28] i can go do what i want to do but i
[1:19:30] believe the message yeah you believe the
[1:19:32] message all right it's that one that
[1:19:33] lucifer told them to say
[1:19:35] them demons up there and then 200 000
[1:19:38] 000 of them got loosed
[1:19:40] you know what brother brown said loose
[1:19:42] on who
[1:19:43] us
[1:19:44] the bride
[1:19:46] all right
[1:19:47] let's be careful
[1:19:49] so let's go to genesis 1. let's start
[1:19:51] right here
[1:19:56] in the beginning
[1:19:59] now he's god
[1:20:01] because he so now he's already created
[1:20:03] something to worship and there is no
[1:20:05] there is no account in genesis 1 to tell
[1:20:08] you when satan or sorry when lucifer
[1:20:12] could you have to call him lucifer first
[1:20:15] i created thee oh lucifer he didn't call
[1:20:18] him satan or the devil then he's lucifer
[1:20:20] see god give him a chance even lucifer
[1:20:22] is called what
[1:20:24] light
[1:20:25] or light bearer
[1:20:26] lucifer is not this dark thing like you
[1:20:28] think he is he's not some demon that you
[1:20:31] can't look at no he's beautiful
[1:20:35] but what has man done what has satan
[1:20:37] done through man
[1:20:39] depicted him in movies and cartoons and
[1:20:43] you boogie man
[1:20:45] i think the devil
[1:20:47] that's just one of his demons but it
[1:20:49] ain't the devil that thing that brother
[1:20:51] branham was allowed to show billy paul
[1:20:53] that looked like the uh alley oops that
[1:20:56] was just that wasn't satan
[1:20:58] that was one of his amps right
[1:21:01] it wasn't that wasn't satan satan's a
[1:21:03] beautiful man
[1:21:06] that's why we're gonna look at him and
[1:21:08] go
[1:21:10] where'd all that horror came from come
[1:21:12] from
[1:21:13] you're beautiful
[1:21:20] it's close
[1:21:22] but once we see
[1:21:23] there's a quote once we see
[1:21:26] the two spirits working in the framework
[1:21:28] of the church
[1:21:31] and can what withstand it and discern it
[1:21:37] with discern it and then withstand it
[1:21:40] so you got to discern it in your heart
[1:21:43] and withstand it and the only way you
[1:21:44] can do it is by what by the word of god
[1:21:47] all right
[1:21:48] so let's go in the beginning god so god
[1:21:50] now i believe he's got angels already
[1:21:52] created and i believe he's already got
[1:21:54] lucifer because you wouldn't be god
[1:21:56] because god is a what objects of worship
[1:21:59] but remember
[1:22:00] brother branham tells us and so does
[1:22:02] scofield that that is
[1:22:04] elohim
[1:22:07] the self-existing god
[1:22:11] even though
[1:22:13] he has created angels
[1:22:17] something to worship him but they're not
[1:22:19] human beings
[1:22:21] they can never be a son and daughter of
[1:22:23] god
[1:22:25] they can never make him father
[1:22:28] they can make him god
[1:22:32] oh
[1:22:34] that ought to get you right here
[1:22:36] how that god has preserved one spot for
[1:22:40] me and you
[1:22:41] that nobody can touch
[1:22:44] satan i don't think satan understood
[1:22:47] that part
[1:22:49] when the genesis 1 26 man came out and
[1:22:51] not just came out
[1:22:53] or like brother dale something vomiting
[1:22:55] up no he just moved over to another farm
[1:22:58] right
[1:23:00] listen that genesis 1 26 and 27 man
[1:23:06] what's the creator
[1:23:10] or he's another person
[1:23:13] oh
[1:23:15] didn't brother brown say you're a little
[1:23:16] creator didn't he walk out there one day
[1:23:18] and said let there be a squirrel
[1:23:20] something satan can't do
[1:23:23] he can pervert the squirrel but he can't
[1:23:25] make one pop out on that limb like
[1:23:27] brother brown did and he said visions
[1:23:29] don't bleed
[1:23:30] what i love that vicious don't bleed he
[1:23:33] says i shot that squirrel and it bled
[1:23:36] so that was a creative act of god listen
[1:23:39] satan was as mad as a hornet that day he
[1:23:41] said i've been trying to do that for 65
[1:23:43] 000 years
[1:23:44] and you got this little
[1:23:46] man down here and he's out here creating
[1:23:48] squirrels everywhere
[1:23:50] you know what you know what the lord
[1:23:52] said he said
[1:23:53] that's my son
[1:23:55] and you're not
[1:23:58] that came from me
[1:24:00] it was a part of me it always was me and
[1:24:04] i created you
[1:24:06] because you got a beginning oh i know
[1:24:08] that william brown he was born april 9
[1:24:10] 19 what oh see oh night where
[1:24:16] god said hang on man
[1:24:18] that's because remember back in the
[1:24:19] garden that's what you did
[1:24:23] you you you you are the one that had him
[1:24:26] come that way
[1:24:28] through the set perversion
[1:24:30] you had him come but what's inside of
[1:24:33] him that's doing the creating
[1:24:35] now
[1:24:36] you can't touch it
[1:24:38] you don't even understand it right right
[1:24:41] you don't even know where that came from
[1:24:45] and that made satan so mad he couldn't
[1:24:47] stand it
[1:24:48] same way within the beginning god
[1:24:50] created heaven and the earth and satan's
[1:24:51] going let me and god's going nope
[1:24:54] say let me nope i think it ought to see
[1:24:57] that's where you get into the trouble
[1:25:00] because satan was standing there going
[1:25:01] no i think that milky way needs to be
[1:25:03] over younger no if god said it's right
[1:25:05] there
[1:25:06] he should have known better
[1:25:10] see that's why what iniquity was found
[1:25:13] in his heart he should have known better
[1:25:15] and kept his mouth shut but he couldn't
[1:25:19] that's the same way with us we get a lot
[1:25:20] of trouble when we what
[1:25:25] and the earth was without form now
[1:25:27] remember he created the heaven and earth
[1:25:28] i want you to look at something here
[1:25:30] real quick
[1:25:36] am i okay
[1:25:39] i want you to project yourself
[1:25:42] back into that space of time not well
[1:25:44] it's actually an eternity
[1:25:47] and
[1:25:48] you're almighty god
[1:25:52] can you do that yeah you can if you got
[1:25:54] him inside of you you can ask him
[1:25:56] because you know what happened i believe
[1:25:57] moses sat down one day and said god i
[1:25:59] want to know what went on in the garden
[1:26:00] he said okay god said okay moses i'll
[1:26:03] i'll tell you what happened in the
[1:26:04] garden and i'll let you write about your
[1:26:05] death if you want to while we're at it
[1:26:07] we'll just write the whole five first
[1:26:08] five books of the bible
[1:26:10] we'll tell you before the flood
[1:26:12] after the flood
[1:26:13] and even after you get gone
[1:26:17] amen
[1:26:19] so why can't he let us just kind of
[1:26:22] stand in not stand in this place
[1:26:24] but stand there and let that oneness
[1:26:26] inside of you project that image
[1:26:30] that hey
[1:26:32] that's the only way it could be
[1:26:34] because god created the heaven and earth
[1:26:36] now brother brown said that period there
[1:26:38] could have been millions of years he
[1:26:40] said nothing else could have happened
[1:26:44] right so you got to go back to the
[1:26:45] prophet
[1:26:47] nothing happened
[1:26:49] for billions of years maybe
[1:26:51] we'll read a quote just a minute maybe
[1:26:53] where he said an atom broke off of the
[1:26:55] sun and world for millions of years and
[1:26:57] then god said stop
[1:27:01] everybody okay
[1:27:04] and the earth was without form and void
[1:27:08] now remember
[1:27:10] we can't tell exactly when satan and
[1:27:12] lucifer i mean when lucifer and michael
[1:27:14] fought but i would say it was before the
[1:27:16] foundation of the world because if sin
[1:27:18] started in heaven
[1:27:21] so god created heaven and earth
[1:27:23] brother louise when he created heaven
[1:27:25] and earth satan's going
[1:27:26] hmm
[1:27:28] place to play
[1:27:30] i can't create but as soon as he creates
[1:27:33] it i can step into it
[1:27:35] oh my
[1:27:38] you got to think like satan now
[1:27:41] but that's the way i was thinking the
[1:27:42] other day i thought man
[1:27:44] god said heaven and earth
[1:27:48] the devil looks down and goes hmm
[1:27:51] i think that's where i'm gonna start my
[1:27:53] business right there i can't go back to
[1:27:54] heaven no more
[1:27:56] i can't go back to where i was at
[1:27:58] so here's something right here that i
[1:27:59] can start with
[1:28:01] so it was that form and void because you
[1:28:03] know what that's the same thing he did
[1:28:04] with you as brother luis was talking
[1:28:05] about your earth was without form and
[1:28:08] void why
[1:28:09] satan was in it
[1:28:11] the devil was in your world that's why
[1:28:14] it's without form and void god can't
[1:28:16] create something evil like that
[1:28:21] but satan can pervert it
[1:28:25] and the earth was without form and void
[1:28:27] because remember now the battle is
[1:28:28] fixing to start on earth
[1:28:30] are they okay with that
[1:28:32] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:28:33] deep and the spirit of god moved upon
[1:28:35] the face of the waters
[1:28:37] and god said let there be light
[1:28:40] and there was light
[1:28:43] and god saw the light
[1:28:45] that it was good and god divided
[1:28:49] the light
[1:28:50] from the darkness
[1:28:53] whose darkness
[1:28:57] satan
[1:28:58] you can't come over here with this light
[1:28:59] set
[1:29:00] not anymore me and you can fellowship we
[1:29:02] can talk to each other but i'm fixing to
[1:29:05] divide this thing up
[1:29:08] is that all right because i'm going to
[1:29:09] tell you watch
[1:29:11] you know what the definition of light is
[1:29:14] put that up brother anderson
[1:29:17] now this is before the sun and the moon
[1:29:18] now you there's a lot of quotes but i
[1:29:20] want to show just watch this
[1:29:24] something that makes vision
[1:29:27] possible
[1:29:28] you cannot see without light
[1:29:34] impossible
[1:29:36] to see without just a little form of
[1:29:39] light because the light receptors hits
[1:29:41] your eyes and then they bounce back out
[1:29:43] and everybody got that
[1:29:46] try to look in the dark
[1:29:47] you can't look in a dark place
[1:29:50] something that makes vision
[1:29:52] possible
[1:29:55] let there be
[1:29:57] now remember light can't be created
[1:30:01] or diminished
[1:30:02] it's always there
[1:30:06] um
[1:30:08] all right the sensation aroused by
[1:30:10] stimulation of the visual
[1:30:14] receptors
[1:30:17] because watch what god said don't take
[1:30:19] it back to it i'm gonna read it right
[1:30:20] here
[1:30:21] and god said let there be light and god
[1:30:24] saw the light
[1:30:25] that it was
[1:30:26] good
[1:30:30] and god what
[1:30:32] saw the light
[1:30:36] he stepped over in another form right
[1:30:39] yeah
[1:30:41] and i'll tell you what that form is all
[1:30:42] that brother i'm telling you but watch
[1:30:43] this electromagnetic magnetic radiation
[1:30:46] of any wavelength that travels in a
[1:30:49] vacuum with a speed of 299
[1:30:51] 792 458 meters
[1:30:54] which is 186 000 miles per second
[1:30:57] specifically such radiation that is
[1:30:59] visible to the human eye
[1:31:02] because remember there's ultraviolet
[1:31:03] lights and there's all we're not going
[1:31:04] to get into that
[1:31:09] keep going on down further dawn a source
[1:31:11] of light a celestial body is night falls
[1:31:14] electric light color of notable
[1:31:16] lightness keep going up
[1:31:17] we got all this we know what some of
[1:31:19] that is watch this
[1:31:22] spiritual
[1:31:23] illumination
[1:31:25] the light shines in the darkness and the
[1:31:27] darkness has not overcome it john 1 5.
[1:31:30] brother dale read it last week
[1:31:32] inner light
[1:31:35] enlightenment reaching out
[1:31:38] and groping for a pathway to the light
[1:31:42] satan looks over and he goes
[1:31:44] where'd that come from
[1:31:46] sorry lucifer looks over and says
[1:31:48] where'd that come from
[1:31:49] god said you don't know anything about
[1:31:51] this
[1:31:53] you don't know anything about this light
[1:31:55] you can't touch this light
[1:31:58] now satan is going to go well i think
[1:31:59] i'll go create my own see remember he's
[1:32:01] son of the morning he's got all that
[1:32:02] he's a bright light but remember his
[1:32:04] light is not created it's artificial
[1:32:08] his light is this right here
[1:32:14] that's his light
[1:32:16] god's light doesn't have an own switch
[1:32:18] and an off switch
[1:32:20] but
[1:32:22] to get to where you and i can see the
[1:32:24] revelation
[1:32:26] to where you and i can read genesis 1
[1:32:28] and understand what god's doing moving
[1:32:31] through an eternity an eternal god that
[1:32:34] had no beginning that has no end
[1:32:39] he's getting ready to bring something
[1:32:41] to being
[1:32:45] spiritual illumination that light shines
[1:32:48] in the darkness
[1:32:49] enlightenment
[1:32:52] revelation
[1:32:55] revelation
[1:32:57] god is getting ready
[1:32:59] he said well what about the heaven on
[1:33:00] earth he's already created that he's
[1:33:02] letting that sit there for a little
[1:33:03] while
[1:33:07] we know he's the creator god because he
[1:33:08] said god created
[1:33:10] go back to genesis 1 please
[1:33:14] thank you
[1:33:17] and god saw the light that it was good
[1:33:19] and god divided the light from the
[1:33:21] darkness he said all right devil what
[1:33:22] i'm fixing to do from now on
[1:33:24] you stay over here
[1:33:28] now of course satan's already going now
[1:33:29] i'm going i'm going to the earth as soon
[1:33:31] as he gets it all good and finished
[1:33:34] remember he's standing right there
[1:33:38] now watch
[1:33:40] let's continue to read
[1:33:42] the account and then let's go back
[1:33:47] god said let there be light and there
[1:33:48] was light
[1:33:49] and what is light it's something that
[1:33:51] makes vision
[1:33:53] possible
[1:33:54] you and i would never know what went on
[1:33:56] in this account of genesis had that
[1:33:58] light not shown up first
[1:34:00] because the sun is our natural light
[1:34:02] it's right out here it's what we
[1:34:04] sustains our natural life
[1:34:07] but don't you think brother louise i've
[1:34:09] read many commentaries of
[1:34:11] of uh jewish scholars
[1:34:14] i read three of them the other night
[1:34:16] and and i agree with one of them two of
[1:34:19] them i don't have a clue what they were
[1:34:20] talking about but but one of them was a
[1:34:22] little bit plain and he said
[1:34:24] you know what he said there stands god
[1:34:27] or
[1:34:28] jehovah yahweh whatever they call him
[1:34:30] you know because he was jewish
[1:34:32] and he said
[1:34:33] all of a sudden he said
[1:34:38] this great big ball
[1:34:41] comes behind him
[1:34:43] not the sun
[1:34:45] but the sun's a part of it
[1:34:47] because you i'll i'm going to read to
[1:34:49] you what brother brown talks about
[1:34:50] clinkers
[1:34:52] put in clinkers he says it six times put
[1:34:54] in clinkers he'll tell you what happened
[1:34:56] he said something came off of something
[1:35:00] it's way same brother wait i believe
[1:35:01] that when he said let there be light
[1:35:02] that the whole universe just lit up
[1:35:07] because the commentator said he said you
[1:35:09] can't have creation without movement
[1:35:14] think about it you can't have creation
[1:35:16] without movement even though god created
[1:35:20] the fish
[1:35:22] remember once that fish came on earth
[1:35:25] there had to be a firing mechanism that
[1:35:26] fired that thing
[1:35:28] why do you why are you at 98.6 degrees
[1:35:31] today
[1:35:34] and where does that come from
[1:35:37] your body is 98.6 degrees and it holds
[1:35:40] that way unless you're sick right why
[1:35:42] does it hold that way
[1:35:45] things are firing off inside of you
[1:35:48] so now take that as a creator
[1:35:51] and let that thing fire out billions
[1:35:53] because he's fixing to create billions
[1:35:55] of stars
[1:35:58] billions
[1:36:00] listen
[1:36:01] our son just lights our solar system
[1:36:05] it doesn't light all that stuff they
[1:36:06] find out there millions and millions and
[1:36:08] millions and millions of light years
[1:36:09] from here
[1:36:12] the sun is for us
[1:36:15] the s-o-n is for us
[1:36:18] this is where we're going to live
[1:36:24] and god saw the light that it was good
[1:36:27] and god divided the light from the
[1:36:28] darkness and god called the light day
[1:36:30] in the darkness he called night and the
[1:36:32] evening in the morning was the first day
[1:36:34] now watch before the sun now remember
[1:36:36] you got to have sun
[1:36:38] just a few minutes here you got to have
[1:36:40] sunlight
[1:36:41] for photosynthesis and what is it warmth
[1:36:45] to do what fire your cells
[1:36:48] c-e-l-l-s fire your cells
[1:36:52] everybody understand that what
[1:36:53] photosynthesis is a plant starts it has
[1:36:56] to get warm
[1:36:57] from what sunlight
[1:37:00] pops open and then it comes out and then
[1:37:02] it has the green shoots and it goes
[1:37:03] through photosynthesis it brings life
[1:37:07] and it grows
[1:37:09] now look and even in the morning with
[1:37:11] the first day and god said let there be
[1:37:12] a firmament and mister the waters and
[1:37:14] let it divide the waters from the waters
[1:37:16] and god made the firmament now what's
[1:37:18] the firmament atmosphere
[1:37:20] everybody got that saying man atmosphere
[1:37:23] you know why he made an atmosphere
[1:37:25] because he's fixing to put living people
[1:37:26] on there
[1:37:27] and animals first and god made the
[1:37:29] firmament divided the waters which were
[1:37:30] under the firmament from the waters
[1:37:31] which were above the firmament and it
[1:37:33] was so remember there was no rain
[1:37:36] until noah's time
[1:37:38] the ground watered in the mid
[1:37:41] mist
[1:37:42] and brother brown said the wells would
[1:37:44] come up out of the ground it would water
[1:37:46] my what an irrigation system
[1:37:49] didn't have to worry about rain brother
[1:37:50] donnie it was just all coming up from
[1:37:52] out of the ground and you just play it
[1:37:53] you know your plants just grew
[1:37:55] god called the firmament heaven in the
[1:37:57] evening in the morning with the second
[1:37:58] day
[1:37:59] and god said let the waters under the
[1:38:01] heaven be gathered together into one
[1:38:02] place and let the dry land appear and it
[1:38:04] was so
[1:38:05] god called the dry land earth and the
[1:38:07] gathering together the water he called
[1:38:08] the seas and god saw that it was good
[1:38:11] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:38:13] grass now look it's bringing forth
[1:38:15] something before the s-u-n is as
[1:38:17] completely made that we need
[1:38:20] so there's so much energy i'm just i
[1:38:22] know i'm not getting it to you
[1:38:24] there's so much energy in this creation
[1:38:28] so the whole place just
[1:38:30] talk about a big bang theory they ain't
[1:38:32] got a clue
[1:38:34] dan got a clue
[1:38:35] i believe it was a big bang
[1:38:37] but i don't believe it was nothing that
[1:38:39] man can control
[1:38:41] it only took god to stop it when it
[1:38:43] needs to stop
[1:38:45] and to keep it going when it needs to
[1:38:46] keep going
[1:38:48] so who is the light
[1:38:50] john 1 says
[1:38:51] he was that light
[1:38:53] john wasn't that light but he was that
[1:38:55] light
[1:38:58] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:39:00] grass the herb yielding seed and the
[1:39:01] fruit trees yielding fruit after his
[1:39:03] kind whose seed is in itself upon the
[1:39:04] earth and it will sow and the earth
[1:39:06] brought forth grass so there was light
[1:39:08] there was some kind of s-u-n light
[1:39:11] before he made the ball
[1:39:14] anybody got that
[1:39:15] so why didn't he listen why didn't he
[1:39:18] just while he was standing there all of
[1:39:19] a sudden behind him comes this thing
[1:39:21] just huge
[1:39:23] ball of
[1:39:24] energy which is all god
[1:39:28] brother brown said all the stars he said
[1:39:30] that's god
[1:39:31] writing his bible
[1:39:33] in the stars
[1:39:36] amen we'll read that in a minute
[1:39:38] so we know basically that on the fourth
[1:39:40] day he created the s-u-n
[1:39:44] or he brought the s-u-n into being
[1:39:46] everybody got sentenced because they
[1:39:47] said let there be lights in the firm of
[1:39:48] the heaven
[1:39:50] to divide the day from the night and let
[1:39:51] them be for signs and seasons and days
[1:39:52] and years and let them be for lights in
[1:39:55] the firm of the heaven to give light
[1:39:56] upon what the earth
[1:39:58] now when he said let there be light he
[1:40:00] didn't say just let there be light on
[1:40:02] earth
[1:40:03] let there be light
[1:40:05] and then big photons just went off
[1:40:08] and i believe it just exploded but watch
[1:40:10] what brother brown says let's read this
[1:40:11] real quick and then we'll close
[1:40:13] number eight is the rising of the sun
[1:40:16] now the sun at the rising of the sun now
[1:40:18] there was a time when the world was
[1:40:19] laying
[1:40:20] in utter darkness it was without form
[1:40:22] and void it was all covered with water
[1:40:24] and laying there dark dismal gloomy
[1:40:26] atmosphere and the spirit of god moved
[1:40:28] upon the water and said let there be
[1:40:29] light
[1:40:30] god had a reason to do that
[1:40:33] for down beneath that water there were
[1:40:35] seeds that he had planted
[1:40:37] and it had to have that sunlight to make
[1:40:39] it live
[1:40:40] but now watch
[1:40:42] he's not talking about the sun right
[1:40:43] here not the s-u-n
[1:40:46] he said and the first light was ever
[1:40:49] given in the earth was god's
[1:40:52] spoken
[1:40:53] word
[1:40:58] when he said
[1:40:59] all right this is going to wake you up
[1:41:01] let there be light
[1:41:03] buddy let me tell you something there
[1:41:05] was a chain reaction that went off
[1:41:07] that you there's no way you could see it
[1:41:10] with your natural human eye only god
[1:41:11] could look at it and say that was good
[1:41:14] you know why because everything i'm
[1:41:15] fixing to make is in that little ball or
[1:41:17] that huge ball right there
[1:41:19] i'm going to make clinkers and i'm going
[1:41:21] to have a prophet talk about clinkers
[1:41:24] we'll talk about it right here but now
[1:41:26] watch the first light ever given on
[1:41:27] earth was god's spoken word the first
[1:41:29] light that ever struck the earth was
[1:41:31] god's spoken word and he said let there
[1:41:34] be light remember it was the logos
[1:41:36] which the logo says the light
[1:41:38] you know what he said amen let there be
[1:41:41] light and there was light that turned
[1:41:42] darkness into light in order to bring
[1:41:45] forth a creation of joy and life upon
[1:41:48] the earth
[1:41:50] revelations 21 verse 22 this is where i
[1:41:52] went to right here watch
[1:41:54] and i saw no temple now this is at the
[1:41:56] end
[1:41:57] this is when we're going into the
[1:41:59] eternal future home
[1:42:03] amen
[1:42:04] and we're going to have plants and
[1:42:05] animals and we're going to have people
[1:42:08] but there's something we don't have to
[1:42:09] have
[1:42:12] like we didn't have to have it to begin
[1:42:14] with had there not been a fall
[1:42:16] and the city had no need of the sun
[1:42:23] neither of the moon
[1:42:25] for the glory of god
[1:42:28] everything's going back to genesis
[1:42:32] oh that future home is gonna water it's
[1:42:34] gonna be lit up right here but let there
[1:42:38] be that was millions of years ago
[1:42:40] he said let there be light and there has
[1:42:42] not been darkness in him at all
[1:42:46] and even when we get to the future home
[1:42:48] brother john you ain't got to turn a
[1:42:49] switch when you go in your house
[1:42:52] you are the light
[1:42:56] the lamb is the light and the nations of
[1:42:58] them which are saved shall walk in the
[1:43:00] light of it
[1:43:03] and the kings of the earth do bring
[1:43:06] their glory and honor into it into what
[1:43:09] the light
[1:43:10] all right
[1:43:11] all right we got another one two or
[1:43:13] three witnesses let's go to isaiah
[1:43:15] isaiah 60 the sun shall be no more thy
[1:43:18] light by day
[1:43:24] neither for brightness shall the moon
[1:43:26] give light unto thee
[1:43:28] but the lord
[1:43:31] the creator
[1:43:33] and now his bride in a multiple form
[1:43:36] that wasn't there but she was in him
[1:43:41] if you tonight don't think that you were
[1:43:43] there you weren't
[1:43:46] but you should be able to say oh god
[1:43:48] when you said let there be light i
[1:43:50] jumped up and said amen
[1:43:53] where did the son
[1:43:55] i know we weren't people
[1:43:58] but the joy of the father is what's
[1:44:00] inside of him
[1:44:03] you can't find me in him
[1:44:06] back before i was born
[1:44:09] because you didn't know that's natural
[1:44:12] but a spiritual god
[1:44:15] that knows every person
[1:44:18] every
[1:44:20] every
[1:44:21] son and daughter of god by name amen
[1:44:27] he knows exactly you know where they
[1:44:28] were
[1:44:31] and what was the first light on the
[1:44:33] earth the spoken word of god how did you
[1:44:36] get here
[1:44:37] you got here by the spoken word of god
[1:44:40] if you god didn't speak to your heart
[1:44:41] you wouldn't be sitting here tonight
[1:44:44] amen so let there be light
[1:44:48] and you go yeah
[1:44:50] it's good
[1:44:52] where were you job
[1:44:56] when the morning stars sang together
[1:44:59] and the sons of god shouted for joy why
[1:45:01] they were inside of the creator
[1:45:07] i couldn't have done this a week ago
[1:45:11] the sun shall no more light by day
[1:45:14] neither for brightness shall the moon
[1:45:15] give any light but the lord
[1:45:18] shall be unto thee
[1:45:20] an everlasting light
[1:45:26] when we walk into that city
[1:45:30] we're the light glory when we walk
[1:45:32] outside of that city
[1:45:35] we're the light
[1:45:36] then jesus tells us that you are the
[1:45:38] light
[1:45:39] of the world
[1:45:41] why hide it under a bushel
[1:45:45] i'm sorry i feel good
[1:45:49] this is a creation why did brother brown
[1:45:51] tell us we're a continuation
[1:45:54] of that creation
[1:45:59] because of the fall there had to be at
[1:46:01] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:46:03] like brother dale's talking about
[1:46:05] that's right
[1:46:08] but before that
[1:46:10] you were never created
[1:46:13] you always were
[1:46:16] that soul inside of you has a fire
[1:46:19] that can light
[1:46:21] a whole planet
[1:46:24] and make it and go live on it
[1:46:30] now who showed william man brandon that
[1:46:33] god showed it to him
[1:46:35] he showed him what he had he said tell
[1:46:37] my people
[1:46:38] what they got right right
[1:46:41] brother brad didn't come to change the
[1:46:43] bible
[1:46:44] he come to tell us what's already been
[1:46:46] said
[1:46:47] amen
[1:46:49] are we living it
[1:46:52] well i didn't get many amens out of that
[1:46:53] one
[1:46:56] but the sun shall no more go down
[1:46:59] neither shall thy moon withdraw itself
[1:47:01] for the lord shall be thine everlasting
[1:47:04] light
[1:47:06] in the days of thy morning
[1:47:09] that's not
[1:47:10] a.m
[1:47:12] that's the days of you mourning and
[1:47:14] crying
[1:47:16] will be over
[1:47:19] but you know what we get a little taste
[1:47:21] of that here
[1:47:24] because we're going to be changed
[1:47:26] our future home will be right here
[1:47:29] and we're going to just step over into
[1:47:31] another dimension
[1:47:33] let man let loose what artificial like
[1:47:36] atomic bombs
[1:47:39] but can you see
[1:47:42] there god stood and said let there be
[1:47:44] light and
[1:47:47] it's never changed since right
[1:47:51] and if there hadn't been a fall
[1:47:53] we wouldn't have needed the sun or moon
[1:47:54] because you know what after the fall is
[1:47:56] over
[1:47:57] that proves we don't need it
[1:48:00] because you're the light
[1:48:02] but see you're heading now see every you
[1:48:04] see the pictures of jesus with mary
[1:48:06] holding jesus and there's this little
[1:48:07] halo around his head a little halo
[1:48:09] around here
[1:48:11] no
[1:48:12] i thought it was a secret
[1:48:14] you and i are a secret light to this
[1:48:16] world that's right they look at you and
[1:48:18] go well you're just a
[1:48:19] 20-something-year-old kid you have
[1:48:21] oh you're just as worldly as the rest of
[1:48:23] them
[1:48:24] then you go
[1:48:26] no
[1:48:28] no there's there's something
[1:48:30] there's something got turned on
[1:48:32] that something got placed in my heart
[1:48:35] and i can trace it back to where god
[1:48:37] stood in eternity and said let there be
[1:48:39] light
[1:48:43] and i my illumination comes from the
[1:48:45] word of god your illumination should
[1:48:47] come from the word of god
[1:48:49] sorry it takes long but i'm going to
[1:48:50] read this one last quote because brother
[1:48:51] brown watch
[1:48:54] there's six quotes but i brought just
[1:48:56] one
[1:48:57] when i get finished with this quote
[1:48:58] musicians come and now the bible teaches
[1:49:01] us that the logos went out from god
[1:49:04] or i might say all of the god becoming
[1:49:06] his first body form when the logos went
[1:49:09] out of god now it's 1953.
[1:49:15] let's look what it looked like
[1:49:18] no one has seen the father at any time
[1:49:20] nowhere never did never will right
[1:49:23] but what is the logos that's the light
[1:49:25] but then the logos that went out of him
[1:49:28] became like a little halo of light
[1:49:30] let's see it playing you under like a
[1:49:32] child before the doorstep of the fight
[1:49:33] you know what he's saying when he says
[1:49:34] that
[1:49:35] here's daddy sitting in the living room
[1:49:38] and we're looking down at our kid
[1:49:39] playing with
[1:49:40] um legos or
[1:49:42] lincoln logs that's what he's talking
[1:49:44] about a child playing right because
[1:49:47] what's he fixing to do he's fixing to
[1:49:48] say let there be
[1:49:50] let there be milky way go over here
[1:49:53] oh so much power but where's that power
[1:49:57] tonight
[1:49:58] it's in you
[1:50:00] you brought it with you yeah if you
[1:50:02] didn't bring it with you it's here for
[1:50:03] you to get right
[1:50:06] and now i can see him as he moves over
[1:50:08] here
[1:50:09] and he draws into his memory or his mind
[1:50:12] what about you have an unlimited memory
[1:50:13] you go all right i'm going to make a
[1:50:14] milky way it's going to have 874 million
[1:50:16] stars and i'm going to put it right over
[1:50:18] there
[1:50:20] try that sometime
[1:50:22] we can't hardly get our furniture
[1:50:23] rearranged in our house
[1:50:25] and now i can see him as he moves over
[1:50:27] here and he draws in his memory or his
[1:50:28] mind a picture of what the world would
[1:50:30] should be
[1:50:31] now there's not a star or nothing
[1:50:34] i hear him say
[1:50:36] let there be
[1:50:38] hold on now
[1:50:41] and then adam
[1:50:43] broke under
[1:50:48] what is the light that's when atoms
[1:50:51] and photons beat each other they hit on
[1:50:53] each other and it creates a spark
[1:50:56] and when it did the sun came into this
[1:50:59] but now watch
[1:51:00] you say oh no now you've done you know
[1:51:02] that look watch what he's saying
[1:51:05] and when it did the sun came into
[1:51:07] existence
[1:51:09] great big ball
[1:51:11] not the sun like we got
[1:51:12] but that sun is inside of that because
[1:51:14] watch what he's saying
[1:51:16] the sun came into existence and began to
[1:51:18] whirl
[1:51:19] she burned for millions of years and
[1:51:21] millions and millions of years after a
[1:51:23] while
[1:51:24] i see a clinker fly off of it
[1:51:28] off of it not coming from somewhere else
[1:51:30] a clinker went off of this great big let
[1:51:33] there be light ball
[1:51:35] everybody got that
[1:51:37] not the sun that we have
[1:51:39] it was created on the fourth day you
[1:51:41] cannot go against the bible
[1:51:44] but like i said when he said let there
[1:51:45] be light why didn't this great i can
[1:51:47] just see this great big energy come out
[1:51:49] into the universe
[1:51:51] but inside of it was the stars inside of
[1:51:54] it was the sun that we live by
[1:51:57] because we're not the only we are the
[1:51:59] only pebbles on the beach but we're not
[1:52:00] the only sun our solar system all right
[1:52:04] after a while i see a clinker fly off of
[1:52:06] it brother brown makes a noise
[1:52:09] what is it the first star
[1:52:11] that flew from the sun
[1:52:14] so if you kept the sun at this
[1:52:16] at our we say little a little bit then
[1:52:19] it's it must be getting smaller
[1:52:21] because there's a clinker going off of
[1:52:23] it
[1:52:24] he watches it fall
[1:52:25] for a few million years and he stops it
[1:52:28] then another one flies off
[1:52:31] and he lets it fall a few million years
[1:52:33] and stops it what's he doing
[1:52:35] he's writing his first bible
[1:52:38] from not the sun that we get up on in
[1:52:40] the morning
[1:52:42] from that sun that he created
[1:52:45] that big boom
[1:52:48] here's this great big ball of energy
[1:52:50] and you know who's standing in the
[1:52:51] middle of it
[1:52:53] the creator
[1:52:54] the logos is standing right in the
[1:52:56] middle of it to me i can see it just as
[1:52:57] plain as today he's standing there just
[1:52:59] like this and there's great big things
[1:53:01] behind him and the devil's going
[1:53:05] what are you fixing to do and he's going
[1:53:08] flicks his finger
[1:53:10] and there goes a star yeah
[1:53:13] he waits a little while longer and he
[1:53:15] flicks his finger
[1:53:16] and that ball gets a little bit smaller
[1:53:18] because to me i think that's as much god
[1:53:19] out there as it is here
[1:53:22] as far as his creation
[1:53:24] you and i we know i know listen
[1:53:26] he's he's what we care about
[1:53:28] but why did he put it all up there first
[1:53:32] that's my whole point musicians come my
[1:53:34] whole point is why did god put the first
[1:53:36] bible in the stars if that wasn't
[1:53:38] important
[1:53:40] because that was the first bible that
[1:53:42] was the first way man navigated that was
[1:53:44] the first way he knew about god was from
[1:53:46] the stars
[1:53:49] that came off of that big ball
[1:53:52] and when god got finished i believe he
[1:53:54] everything clinked off that sun and it
[1:53:57] became the size that we needed
[1:54:00] because then brother branham another
[1:54:01] quote he said all right he said now the
[1:54:02] earth is too far
[1:54:04] he said i'm just going to bring it back
[1:54:08] 93 million miles away that way we can
[1:54:09] have summer winter and fall it'll be my
[1:54:11] word
[1:54:13] it'll be my word made manifest
[1:54:16] and this earth is where we're going to
[1:54:17] live
[1:54:18] i'm going to put my children on it
[1:54:21] and i'm going to take care of it
[1:54:23] and i'm going to put a garden in there
[1:54:25] and i know what you're going to do
[1:54:26] lucifer
[1:54:28] but don't worry
[1:54:32] job said i know
[1:54:34] my redeemer living
[1:54:37] i believe he got a revelation that he
[1:54:39] looked back in time because he said job
[1:54:42] where were you when the sons of god
[1:54:43] shout
[1:54:44] i believe he projected job back job had
[1:54:47] a revelation
[1:54:49] he had a light experience
[1:54:51] a revelation
[1:54:54] that something happened
[1:54:56] and now job's here in this bad situation
[1:54:59] but then he looks back and he sees him
[1:55:00] again and he said oh
[1:55:02] that man's coming to get me
[1:55:05] folks that's not a hope
[1:55:07] that's a promise of almighty god he's
[1:55:09] coming back to get us he will not let
[1:55:12] our let that creation just
[1:55:14] be nothing
[1:55:16] let's stand our feet god bless you
[1:55:19] i love that definition
[1:55:21] something that makes vision possible
[1:55:25] the sensual sensation aroused by
[1:55:28] stimulation of the visual receptors
[1:55:33] who in here likes darkness
[1:55:36] we all like light
[1:55:39] when that light comes on in the morning
[1:55:41] even if it may be just the light in your
[1:55:42] house you feel more comfortable
[1:55:45] than you do in the darkness
[1:55:47] it's what much more in the spiritual
[1:55:49] light
[1:55:50] when we get up out of the bed
[1:55:54] and we start our day
[1:55:57] we'll
[1:55:58] walk in the light
[1:56:01] such a beautiful light
[1:56:04] come where the dewdrops of mercy are
[1:56:08] bright
[1:56:10] shine all around us by day and by night
[1:56:17] jesus
[1:56:19] the light of the world
[1:56:23] all ye saints of
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:34] [Applause]
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:40] in his name
[1:56:44] jesus
[1:56:46] the light of
[1:56:48] the world
[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:57:00] [Music]
[1:57:01] [Applause]
[1:57:05] [Music]
[1:57:08] shine
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:23] i know some of us that deer hunting
[1:57:24] different things have you ever been in a
[1:57:25] place to where you
[1:57:27] you just couldn't get warm
[1:57:30] why because there was no sunlight
[1:57:33] i've had my feet beast of froze you
[1:57:34] couldn't feel them brother gary but i'd
[1:57:36] find some light coming through the woods
[1:57:38] and i'd stick my toe
[1:57:41] how many of you done that
[1:57:42] brother danny's done it you'll find that
[1:57:44] sunlight and i'll guarantee in just a
[1:57:46] few minutes you'll feel that what
[1:57:48] warm light
[1:57:50] listen that's an energy think about this
[1:57:53] that's an energy that took 40 000 years
[1:57:56] to get to the top of the sun and then go
[1:57:58] 93 million miles
[1:58:03] what god's done for us people
[1:58:06] just in the natural
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:08] i need some sunlight on my shoes god
[1:58:12] okay
[1:58:13] it's been produced several thousand
[1:58:15] years ago it'll be there in just a few
[1:58:16] minutes
[1:58:19] same way with the spiritual
[1:58:22] he's not going to leave you cold and
[1:58:24] formal
[1:58:26] but you got to get to where the light is
[1:58:30] you can't walk in darkness
[1:58:34] light is a form of energy
[1:58:37] energy can neither be created nor
[1:58:39] destroyed
[1:58:41] it can only be changed from one form to
[1:58:44] another
[1:58:45] god decided to change his form to a
[1:58:49] bride
[1:58:51] and the coldest this world's ever been
[1:58:54] there's always been a bride
[1:58:57] but when we leave this place brother bob
[1:59:03] the light will be gone
[1:59:05] there'll be no more light until we come
[1:59:07] back
[1:59:08] in the millennium
[1:59:10] but not really until we come back in the
[1:59:12] future home because john saw that big
[1:59:14] bright ball
[1:59:15] come down out of heaven
[1:59:18] and brother brown says there'll be no
[1:59:19] night there'll be no day inside that
[1:59:21] city why
[1:59:23] you don't need the sunshine anymore you
[1:59:25] need to let there be
[1:59:28] [Music]
[1:59:29] just as brother dale was telling y'all
[1:59:31] the other night
[1:59:32] god was pleased to dwell in jesus christ
[1:59:36] when you got born again you had a river
[1:59:38] jordan experience
[1:59:40] god came down with that heavenly light
[1:59:42] and said i am pleased to reside right
[1:59:45] here
[1:59:46] if you have not had that experience
[1:59:48] tonight do not
[1:59:51] fall asleep because it may be your last
[1:59:53] time
[1:59:55] please
[1:59:57] get that warmth in here
[2:00:00] i'd rather have it in here i can put on
[2:00:01] enough clothes and i turn on a heater
[2:00:04] but when the coldness of hell comes on
[2:00:06] top of you
[2:00:07] you need a light from somewhere else
[2:00:10] you don't need a light bulb
[2:00:14] they've done made light now where led
[2:00:16] light don't even give off any don't give
[2:00:18] off any heat
[2:00:20] artificial
[2:00:22] satan has artificial light
[2:00:24] but god never has artificial light never
[2:00:27] had it never will have it
[2:00:29] and ye are the light
[2:00:34] oh jesus
[2:00:36] sing out
[2:00:37] course one more time when you're
[2:00:38] dismissed
[2:00:41] oh well walking in the line
[2:00:45] go with god you're dismissed
[2:00:48] for life
[2:00:50] come when i do
[2:00:54] of mercy
[2:00:56] our bride
[2:00:58] o shine all around us
[2:01:02] by day and
[2:01:04] by night
[2:01:08] the light of
[2:01:10] the world
[2:01:14] come
[2:01:16] confess
[2:01:18] him as your king
[2:01:22] jesus
[2:01:27] [Music]
