[1:43] because i want to read a good bit of it
[1:50] let's go back to
[1:53] let's read the whole chapter
[1:55] ephesians 4 verse 1.
[1:58] paul says i therefore the prisoner of
[1:59] the lord
[2:00] beseech you that you walk worthy
[2:03] of the vocation
[2:05] wherewith you are called
[2:07] all right
[2:09] with all lowliness and meekness with
[2:11] long suffering
[2:12] for bearing and you know we need to turn
[2:13] this on thank you
[2:15] okay
[2:19] plug this up too at least
[2:29] what does that vocation mean
[2:32] whatever you're called in like i'm a
[2:34] teacher i'm a teacher i'm not an
[2:37] evangelist and so don't
[2:40] i don't want to be an evangelist
[2:42] all right work
[2:43] hello work with you
[2:45] work will work
[2:50] i don't think you're talking about
[2:51] electronics though
[2:55] they don't work all the time i mean your
[2:57] job in the church
[2:59] your job in the church hello hello hello
[3:02] hello hello hello hello
[3:05] bench warmer whatever anyway yeah we got
[3:08] that okay rare warrior
[3:10] yep that's right that's your vocation
[3:12] what worthy of the vocation where with
[3:14] your call
[3:16] all right
[3:17] she called to do something
[3:19] brother brown said when brad realized
[3:21] who she is and what she's doing here
[3:22] well that's
[3:24] ephesians four verse one
[3:27] with all loneliness and meekness with
[3:28] long suffering for bearing one another
[3:30] in love so
[3:32] he's paul is probably
[3:35] uh by this time he's
[3:38] talked to peter he and peter have talked
[3:40] about the statue of a perfect man not it
[3:42] being the statue of a perfect man but
[3:44] talking about growth development because
[3:46] peter had it in second peter 1
[3:48] or and then you see
[3:50] paul
[3:51] bringing it just a little different way
[3:54] and he basically tells you
[3:57] how you're going to get it peter tells
[3:59] you what to get
[4:01] everybody understand peter tells you
[4:02] what to give add to your faith virtual
[4:04] version of get the divine nature of god
[4:06] as this and that's this but now what
[4:07] paul says all right this is the way
[4:08] you're going to get it
[4:10] okay got it
[4:13] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[4:15] spirit in the bond of peace
[4:17] there is one body
[4:20] this is the body of christ
[4:22] all right this is the body
[4:25] one spirit even as you're called in one
[4:28] hope of your calling
[4:30] one lord one faith
[4:32] one baptism
[4:34] one god and father of all who is above
[4:36] all through all and bless his
[4:39] southern name in you all
[4:42] paul was a seller
[4:48] probably from albany
[4:50] yeah
[4:52] l.a no because he would have said y'all
[5:03] somewhere but until every one of us has
[5:05] given grace according to the measure of
[5:08] the gift of christ see what he's doing
[5:09] is measure
[5:10] measure
[5:12] this is measurement this is my measure
[5:14] your growth right
[5:16] we put the little lines on the wall in
[5:18] the end we got it in the bed in the
[5:19] bathroom
[5:20] we put a little head there and marked
[5:22] her growth one year and then mark it the
[5:24] next year and market well we we mark her
[5:27] growth well what does it look like it's
[5:29] marks
[5:31] it don't go that way she doesn't shrink
[5:33] she grows okay she's growing in a
[5:36] stature that's what we should be doing
[5:38] growing in a stature
[5:40] but until every one of us has given
[5:42] grace according to the measure
[5:44] of the gift of christ
[5:47] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[5:49] on high he led captivity captive and
[5:51] gave gifts unto men
[5:54] now paul's fixing to interpolate because
[5:55] look at the parentheses
[5:57] now that he ascended
[5:59] what is it but he also descended first
[6:02] into the lower parts of the earth
[6:04] he's filling in he's telling you that
[6:05] jesus went to hell right went to the
[6:07] lower parts of the earth
[6:09] he that descended
[6:11] is the same also that ascended up far
[6:14] above all heavens that he might fill all
[6:15] things
[6:17] now
[6:19] if you take that out
[6:21] take verse 9 out let's read it let's
[6:23] verse 8. wherefore he says when he
[6:25] ascended up on high he led captivity
[6:27] captive and give gifts unto men and he
[6:29] gave some apostles
[6:31] some prophets there's the gifts that
[6:32] you're getting right but paul
[6:34] interpolate in verse 9 tells you that
[6:36] jesus went to hell went to heaven now
[6:38] he's come back down here right
[6:40] to give us gifts and he gave some
[6:42] apostles some prophets some evangelists
[6:45] and some pastors and teachers
[6:48] for the perfecting
[6:50] of the saints for the work of the
[6:52] ministry for the edifying
[6:55] of the body of christ
[6:57] till we all come
[7:00] in the unity of the faith
[7:03] this puts us in unity when we come to
[7:05] brotherly kindness that puts us into
[7:07] unity of the faith
[7:09] and of and of the knowledge of the son
[7:12] of god
[7:13] unto a perfect man
[7:15] unto the measure see there's another
[7:17] measurement measure
[7:18] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[7:21] that we hint forth
[7:23] what does henceforth mean
[7:25] now
[7:26] and going on
[7:28] henceforth means now and going on all
[7:31] right
[7:32] that we henceforth be no more children
[7:35] this is children down here this is
[7:37] babies all right
[7:39] toss to and fro
[7:41] and carry it about with every wind of
[7:43] doctrine we see that happening already
[7:47] by the slight of men now not the
[7:49] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[7:50] evangelists that god has put
[7:53] gifts in the church it's one that man
[7:54] has put in the church all right
[8:00] carried about with everyone adopted by
[8:01] the slightest man and cunning craftiness
[8:04] whereby they lying wait to deceive
[8:08] that has nothing to do with this
[8:10] this is perfect
[8:12] that is the other side okay
[8:14] but speak the truth and love what these
[8:17] five folds
[8:18] but speaking the truth in love
[8:21] may grow up into him in all things which
[8:24] is heavy in christ all right so paul is
[8:26] pointing to here
[8:28] he's pointing to the head that's the
[8:30] head right there divine love that's the
[8:31] headship
[8:33] that's the son of man ministry that was
[8:34] jesus christ fully walking on the earth
[8:37] all right
[8:40] may grow up into him there's another
[8:42] measurement grow up into him
[8:44] and all things which is the head even
[8:46] christ
[8:47] for whom the whole body
[8:49] fitly joined together now we're going to
[8:50] read that in just a minute because
[8:51] brother brown said the holy spirit comes
[8:53] down and what we call welding welding
[8:56] these things together
[8:58] all right what
[8:59] fitly joined together
[9:01] and compacted
[9:04] there's only one way you can compact
[9:06] something
[9:07] you beat it
[9:09] that's right squeeze it right
[9:11] pressure or squeeze it
[9:13] but to compact if we compact the ground
[9:15] to plant whatever we need to plant or
[9:17] put pavers down or anything even when
[9:19] they build a road you see any big roller
[9:21] graters they're full of water and they
[9:23] weigh thousands of pounds what are they
[9:24] doing they're compacting the earth
[9:27] so that when they pour that heavy
[9:28] concrete on it
[9:30] part of it doesn't sink down here and
[9:31] part of it stays up here that compaction
[9:34] pushes it down so so paul is really
[9:37] you know
[9:39] peter says paul says things hard to be
[9:41] understood peter was i mean paul was a
[9:43] little a little bit more in
[9:46] the word i guess than peter was because
[9:47] he's a prophet
[9:49] sure peter could be a minor prophet but
[9:50] paul was a major
[9:53] church age messenger prophet he was a
[9:55] pattern messenger so we had to know a
[9:57] little bit more than peter about this
[9:59] stature of a perfect man so he's staying
[10:01] fitly joined together and compacted by
[10:04] that which every joint supply
[10:06] the every joint
[10:09] right
[10:12] making okay but at whichever joint
[10:14] supply according to the effectual
[10:16] working in the measure there's another
[10:19] measurement in the measure
[10:21] of every part now when i start on this
[10:24] in january y'all don't lay out on me i
[10:26] want some amends up there
[10:28] in the in the sanctuary don't you fall
[10:31] asleep because you're going to hear this
[10:32] over again
[10:33] but maybe in a little different form
[10:37] making look
[10:39] measure
[10:41] of every part making increase what is
[10:43] increase
[10:44] it's a measurement volume okay increase
[10:47] making increase of the body into the
[10:50] edifying of itself
[10:53] in love
[10:55] because you got to edify the body first
[10:58] the body must be edified first before
[11:01] you go out and give it to somebody else
[11:02] because if you can't you know if we
[11:04] can't strive together and and you know
[11:07] talk about our
[11:08] you know it's like i always said you
[11:10] you
[11:11] family
[11:12] you know fights in the backyard
[11:14] between each other
[11:16] but don't fight my brother and sister in
[11:18] the front yard okay because you got to
[11:19] deal with me
[11:20] we may fight in the backyard but don't
[11:22] fight me and go fight my family in the
[11:24] front yard so the same way with here we
[11:26] may have little things among us that we
[11:27] got to get worked out but
[11:29] we better stand true because you know
[11:31] this is the only family we really got
[11:33] is this family here
[11:36] into the edifying of itself in love so
[11:38] the edification's got to come from here
[11:40] and flow out right
[11:42] this i say therefore and testify in the
[11:45] lord that you henceforth there it is
[11:47] from here and
[11:48] from here and beyond
[11:50] walk not as other gentiles walk in the
[11:52] vanity of their mind
[11:55] the world
[11:56] okay in the vanity of their mind
[11:59] having the understanding darken now he's
[12:02] bringing it back in
[12:04] where paul's talking about one day he
[12:05] talks about grievous wolves coming in
[12:07] the book of acts
[12:08] because and he said and among you now
[12:11] say he knew they were among him then
[12:12] that brother knew there was people among
[12:15] him among his group that didn't believe
[12:18] what he said
[12:20] having the understanding darkened being
[12:22] being alienated from the life of god
[12:27] through
[12:30] the ignorance that is in them
[12:36] you have a choice
[12:41] but remember ignorance once truth is
[12:43] presented to you it's not ignorance
[12:45] anymore it turns into iniquity
[12:48] and there's no sacrifice for that except
[12:49] come back to the truth
[12:51] there is an ignorance offering in the
[12:53] old testament if you ignorantly done
[12:55] something which means you don't know
[12:57] okay if you've ignorantly done something
[12:59] then there was a sacrifice there but
[13:01] when you do it willfully having the
[13:03] knowledge of the truth see paul brings
[13:05] that out again he's if you do things
[13:06] willfully now having a knowledge of the
[13:08] truth there's no sacrifice for that
[13:10] you got to repent you got to come back
[13:11] to god even you can't just keep walking
[13:14] or you're just not part of the body of
[13:15] christ
[13:17] having the understanding darken being
[13:20] alienated from the life of god through
[13:22] the ignorance that is in them
[13:26] because of the blindness
[13:29] of their heart
[13:32] there's your cause
[13:33] because of the blindness and not your
[13:34] heart your soul that's right
[13:37] the blindness of your soul all right
[13:39] who being past
[13:41] who being past feeling have given
[13:43] themselves over until lasciviousness to
[13:45] work all uncleanness
[13:47] with greediness now that don't have
[13:48] nothing to do with here this is
[13:50] cleanness
[13:52] this is not selfishness all right
[13:55] uncleanness and greediness which is
[13:57] taking them out
[13:58] but ye have not so learned christ
[14:02] if so be that you have heard him
[14:05] and have been taught by him as the truth
[14:07] is in jesus
[14:09] that you put off concerning the former
[14:11] conversation of the old man all right
[14:13] this is in the conversation of the old
[14:14] man
[14:15] when you get born again okay
[14:18] that you put off concerning the former
[14:20] conversation of the old man
[14:22] which is corrupt
[14:26] so there ain't nothing good about us
[14:27] anyway that's right
[14:29] none good no not one that's right if
[14:31] y'all remember wednesday night or sunday
[14:33] brother they were ready to quote and
[14:34] i've got it pinned
[14:36] that i'm going to use and i wish i'd
[14:38] used it at the
[14:39] minister's meeting brother branson you
[14:40] were born with a sinful soul
[14:42] and questions and answers he said you
[14:44] somebody said explain body spirit and
[14:46] soul he said no you were born with a
[14:48] sinful soul so
[14:51] why can't we just realize that we were
[14:53] born wrong
[14:54] we were born wrong everything about us
[14:56] was wrong there was were totally
[14:58] contrary
[14:59] totally alienated from the commonwealth
[15:01] of god paul said all right
[15:03] but they put off concerning the former
[15:05] conversation of the old man which is
[15:06] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[15:09] and i don't mean just lush for the body
[15:11] that means lust of all things that's
[15:12] right okay
[15:14] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[15:16] mind
[15:18] you're still in that statue of a perfect
[15:20] man because if you're not being renewed
[15:21] in your mind which is working right into
[15:24] that soul
[15:27] that's where that comes from
[15:28] remember that works from the inside out
[15:30] yes okay
[15:33] where for what i'm sorry
[15:37] and bet you i'm sorry 24 and that you
[15:39] put on the new man
[15:42] which is that which after god is created
[15:47] all right you don't get a new soul
[15:50] remember created means make a new
[15:53] remember we looked in genesis 1 26 god
[15:55] created man well he couldn't have
[15:56] created that man so that man is eternal
[15:59] he formed or fashioned or brought it
[16:01] into view so you can see it all right so
[16:03] he's doing the same thing which after
[16:05] god is created in righteousness and true
[16:08] holiness so now the buddy that's
[16:10] that's up there all right
[16:12] godliness and true holy see how paul's
[16:14] walking you right through the statue of
[16:15] perfect ma'am
[16:17] wherefore putting away lying speaking
[16:20] every man truth with his neighbor
[16:23] remember what was the second greatest
[16:24] commandment besides love the lord thy
[16:25] god with all thy heart second one love
[16:27] thy neighbor as thyself
[16:29] and brother brown said that was that
[16:31] brother kindness all right wherefore
[16:33] putting away lying speak every man truth
[16:36] with his neighbor for we are members one
[16:38] of another
[16:40] all right
[16:41] be ye angry and sin not
[16:45] watch how he puts all that in there
[16:48] be angry and sin not he throws that in
[16:50] there
[16:51] let not the sun go down upon your wrath
[16:55] jesus was angry
[16:56] i don't believe he was mad there's a
[16:58] difference in mad and angry
[16:59] right big difference
[17:02] in mad and angry yes do you
[17:05] this is a stupid question but
[17:07] did jesus apologize to those people he
[17:10] chased out of the temple because it says
[17:12] that the sunshine could not go down here
[17:14] and he didn't do that no i don't think
[17:16] he did
[17:18] well he said unto though at the cross he
[17:21] kind of
[17:22] laid everything out when he said father
[17:24] forgive him you know he
[17:25] in his in his soul
[17:28] in his soul which was almighty god
[17:31] he had to look at them as a just god
[17:34] which was judgment they were doing
[17:36] something it's kind of like when he
[17:37] walked up to the woman at the when they
[17:39] throwed her down remember with the woman
[17:40] that was caught in the act of adultery
[17:42] right right
[17:43] but remember if jesus had seen the act
[17:46] if he would have went with those people
[17:48] and seen the act
[17:50] of that woman committing adultery he
[17:52] would have had to stone her first
[17:53] because he was the priest he would have
[17:55] to stone her
[17:57] but what did he do he told him he said
[17:58] okay any of you got
[18:00] no sin that's the first time
[18:03] so they all left
[18:05] he said woman where are your accusers
[18:08] well jesus was standing there yeah
[18:11] woman where are your accusers she said i
[18:12] have none
[18:14] in other words he's saying well i didn't
[18:16] see you do it either
[18:18] i didn't see you do it
[18:20] where's your witnesses
[18:21] so it's just me and you standing here
[18:23] i'm a man and you're a woman
[18:25] i'll forgive you for sins and that's
[18:26] what god does to all of us
[18:28] right because remember he doesn't see
[18:30] our sin
[18:32] remember he doesn't see our sins he
[18:35] hears our voice through the blood
[18:38] right he hears our voice through the
[18:40] blood and that was that whole
[18:43] scenario that that was because see the
[18:45] world's gonna condemn you you're gonna
[18:47] be standing there in judgment one day
[18:50] and you know you're gonna do something
[18:51] wrong to somebody and they're gonna look
[18:53] up there and they're gonna see you
[18:54] standing there in white doing the
[18:55] judging and you're they're going to go
[18:59] i did you know in other words that
[19:01] what's he doing standing up there and
[19:02] i'm doing that here because he did
[19:04] something to me
[19:05] and jesus is going to say well he asked
[19:07] me for forgiveness and you did
[19:09] that's going to be just as simple as
[19:10] that i mean he's just going to be it's
[19:12] just going to be so simple
[19:14] so that's what the woman the woman
[19:16] standing there in the act of adultery
[19:17] we're all an adulterer
[19:19] we were born from an adulterous act so
[19:21] we were all committed we were just like
[19:23] that woman we were caught in the act of
[19:24] adultery
[19:26] and the world was standing around her
[19:27] that saw her do it
[19:29] but she couldn't commit adultery about
[19:31] herself
[19:32] no
[19:34] no
[19:36] but let's stay with this story
[19:38] huh
[19:39] yeah
[19:40] so we all committed spiritual adultery
[19:42] let's put it that way because we
[19:44] you might all could not committed
[19:46] natural adultery just being born between
[19:48] your mom and your daddy
[19:50] you're born an adulterer you're born in
[19:52] sin shaping an iniquity a spouse from
[19:54] your mother's womb a liar you know we
[19:55] were all born dead
[19:57] and we're caught in the act
[20:00] because if jesus brother brown said if
[20:01] jesus don't look through the blood he'll
[20:02] kill you too because of this thing
[20:04] that's right see because of this he'll
[20:06] have to kill you because this is
[20:07] contrary to god that's why flesh and
[20:09] blood this flesh and blood that he sees
[20:12] if he was to see it through the blood
[20:14] he'd have to destroy this because it's
[20:16] contrary to anything he ever had to
[20:18] begin with this is permissive well
[20:21] but he had to put that layer of blood
[20:24] like brother branham brother brown
[20:26] wanted to condemn that old woman for
[20:28] being a prostitute and
[20:30] jesus said
[20:32] come here from come here man chris let
[20:34] me walk behind the door for a minute
[20:35] i'll show you something
[20:37] yours is just as bad as her there ain't
[20:39] no big center louisiana you know
[20:41] so he went back with a different
[20:43] attitude
[20:44] same way with the woman then that was
[20:45] caught in the act of adultery we all
[20:47] were caught in the act but he didn't see
[20:48] us do it
[20:50] that's what we got to realize that's the
[20:51] true justification that you never did it
[20:55] to start with
[20:56] the real you
[20:58] and what you know in in let me interpret
[21:00] that's what god's saying god is saying
[21:02] had you not have fallen had you not have
[21:04] come here in a fallen condition that
[21:06] holy ghost that's inside of you would
[21:08] have never done that
[21:11] see so that's what he looks at he looks
[21:13] at that genesis what genesis one man you
[21:15] got to follow him down
[21:17] if you follow him down right we are
[21:19] sinless
[21:20] because of that
[21:22] not because of this
[21:23] but because of what's inside of us
[21:25] that's where the sinlessness starts
[21:28] because listen
[21:29] god won't dwell in an unclean vessel but
[21:31] the very day you get born again and
[21:33] still have issues and problems and all
[21:35] these things that you don't have god
[21:37] says i'm pleased to dwell in that person
[21:39] right there
[21:41] that's what he said that's right on
[21:43] river jordan he said i'm pleased to
[21:45] dwell in that now it's not here you him
[21:46] but i'm pleased to dwell in that vessel
[21:48] right there
[21:50] with all of our inadequacies and all the
[21:52] things that we do wrong he's pleased to
[21:54] dwell because that's where he wanted to
[21:55] dwell to begin with
[21:58] something just hit me when you say that
[22:00] that's how important asking for
[22:02] forgiveness is that's true because just
[22:05] by the act of us asking for forgiveness
[22:07] he was he's pleased to dwell in us right
[22:10] and brother adam said the reason david
[22:12] was a man after god's own right was that
[22:13] he repented right you read what on the
[22:15] psalms there he's just a very repentant
[22:17] man
[22:18] but see if david would have had the holy
[22:20] ghost here we go back to the example if
[22:21] david would have had the indwelling of
[22:23] the new birth right there's a lot of
[22:25] things in there he would have done
[22:28] but that wasn't there yet but see god
[22:30] was still looking at him through the
[22:31] blood
[22:33] had to be looking at him through the
[22:34] blood but remember there's a literal
[22:36] time that you and i have to come down
[22:38] here and we have to prove that that's
[22:40] right because he forgave us before the
[22:42] foundation of the world i mean everybody
[22:44] says that and that's okay
[22:46] well you were forgiven before you asked
[22:48] but you gotta ask that's right
[22:50] but you gotta ask
[22:51] you can't just go through life and say
[22:52] well i was forgiven for it even started
[22:54] so i don't have to you know that's not
[22:56] the right attitude that's right yeah no
[22:58] you you need to ask forgiveness that's
[23:00] what baptists say yeah i was forgiven
[23:03] yeah well i didn't want saved always
[23:04] saying
[23:05] right
[23:06] once saved always that's kind of people
[23:08] in the message
[23:09] let's come to a message church you'll be
[23:10] fine
[23:12] don't worry about it
[23:15] once they always say
[23:17] i believe that
[23:20] if it's true
[23:21] if it's true
[23:23] you always were saved
[23:25] but baby let me tell you something like
[23:27] i told them preachers that weekend i
[23:28] said when you was down on that
[23:30] floor slobbering and crying and snotting
[23:32] all over the place asking god forgive me
[23:34] your sins you went laying there going
[23:36] well i always was eternal i knew that
[23:38] you know i just come to this realization
[23:40] didn't i and that's what i told him with
[23:42] it
[23:43] that's what i told him preachers i said
[23:44] you know what i said snot and i said
[23:46] y'all laying around the floor snotting
[23:48] and crying and spitting
[23:50] and crying out to god i said you weren't
[23:52] laying down on the floor going well
[23:54] bless god i always was then i always was
[23:56] eternal that's right i said no he's
[23:58] crying out for forgiveness why were you
[24:00] crying out for forgiveness because he's
[24:02] a sinner
[24:04] now you read see the problem with people
[24:05] now is
[24:07] i realize that now though
[24:09] that i always was eternal
[24:11] what i have if i'm born again i have
[24:14] what i have always was eternal what came
[24:16] to me that day always was eternal
[24:19] but they had to come to a day that i
[24:20] realized that and look back and the more
[24:23] grace i see now is just to look back and
[24:25] see how god had his hand in everything
[24:27] that's more precious believe in the
[24:29] other right exactly grace it's common
[24:32] sense it's grace yeah well
[24:35] right
[24:36] with creatures
[24:38] you say common sense yes
[24:44] i got in trouble telling them that
[24:48] remember i told them i said you need to
[24:49] lay your quotes aside
[24:51] lay your computers aside and just listen
[24:53] for a minute well they interpreted that
[24:56] i said were supposed to do away with all
[24:57] the quotes and not
[24:59] didn't it
[25:00] ain't what i said
[25:02] but it's what but it's what is what they
[25:04] interpreted that i said
[25:07] they just don't want to listen because
[25:08] most of them
[25:10] it's like you said they have itchineers
[25:11] and they want to refute everything you
[25:13] say but anyway
[25:14] that's okay verse 23 and be renewed in
[25:16] the spirit of your mind let's finish
[25:18] this before we go
[25:19] and as you put on the new man which
[25:21] which after god is created in
[25:23] righteousness and true holiness
[25:25] wherefore putting away lying speaking
[25:27] every man truth with his neighbor
[25:29] for we are members one or the other one
[25:30] of another be angry and sin not let not
[25:33] the sun go down on your wrath neither
[25:35] give place to the devil all right
[25:38] let him that stole steal no more
[25:41] kind of simple isn't it
[25:43] don't get down and say 25 hail marys and
[25:46] you know that's what the catholic church
[25:47] does
[25:48] no but rather let him labor
[25:51] working with his hands the things which
[25:53] is good that he may have to give to him
[25:56] that needeth now you can take that
[25:58] naturally or you can take that
[26:00] spiritually you need to work with your
[26:02] spiritual hands so if somebody needs
[26:04] some of this right hair
[26:06] some of this virtue you got it to give
[26:08] to them because you've already done your
[26:10] work you've already done your work
[26:13] because this is the work of the holy
[26:14] ghost this is the work of holy ghost
[26:15] right so you've done your work which is
[26:17] good that he may have to give them that
[26:19] needed peter says silver and gold have
[26:20] none right that's exactly what that is
[26:23] talking about
[26:26] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[26:28] of your mouth but that which is good to
[26:30] the use of edifying that it may minister
[26:32] grace
[26:33] unto the hearers all right
[26:35] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[26:37] whereby you are sealed
[26:39] unto the day of redemption not until
[26:42] unto i said journey
[26:44] unto the day of redemption all right
[26:47] because you can grieve the holy spirit
[26:49] brother brown said you'll grieve him
[26:50] he'll go on a limb sit there and wait on
[26:52] you he's not gonna go out on a tree and
[26:53] sit and wait on you that's just an
[26:54] analogy that's just an example
[26:56] what he does is the holy ghost who says
[26:58] hey
[26:59] you're not acting good i'm not gonna i'm
[27:02] not gonna i'm not gonna help you
[27:05] with that kind of attitude but when you
[27:07] get rid of that
[27:08] just call on your daddy call on your
[27:10] father and he'll come back
[27:13] okay
[27:13] but just as simple as that
[27:16] that's why david said return unto me the
[27:17] joy of salvation david would be anointed
[27:20] in the spirit he would feel just
[27:21] wonderful oh god would just anoint him
[27:23] just like a river and then all of a
[27:25] sudden
[27:27] where are you lord
[27:28] you know like jesus on the cross he said
[27:31] what why is that forsaking me one the
[27:33] anointing had lifted off of him that had
[27:35] been on him the whole time
[27:37] and grieve not the holy spirit of god
[27:38] for by your seal
[27:41] unto the day of redemption let all
[27:42] bitterness and wrath and anger and
[27:45] clamor and evil speaking
[27:48] be put away from you
[27:49] with all malice and be kind one to
[27:52] another tender hearted forgiving one
[27:54] another even as god for christ's sake
[27:57] have forgiven you
[28:00] that happens right up to right here
[28:03] you don't ever stop asking forgiveness
[28:06] you don't ever stop needing forgiveness
[28:09] even right here
[28:11] you have to watch what you're doing
[28:13] and let god do the work tell anybody any
[28:16] questions
[28:17] i don't have a question i just have i
[28:19] just wanted to tell everybody last
[28:20] sunday
