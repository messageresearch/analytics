[0:00] all right we're on Romans 15 we've got
[0:01] one more chapter and then I've been
[0:07] asked by two people to do straight from
[0:09] the spirits oh no I said I'll have two
[0:15] people say that so I've had nobody else
[0:18] saying anything else he said he brings
[0:20] and something something for my to people
[0:25] want me to do
[0:26] I want us to do the spirit of self but
[0:29] you know y'all decide we got you this
[0:31] brings out yeah is in labor yep you're
[0:35] right it's in there somewhere if we ever
[0:38] get to it
[0:39] we got this one one more chapter and
[0:43] then we're done so it's only gonna be a
[0:47] couple more weeks and then we'll decide
[0:50] so they don't want to get I don't wanna
[0:52] get too in-depth because let's see what
[0:54] we got we've got three more Sundays and
[1:03] I'll be going to the Philippines to
[1:04] seven through the nineteen
[1:06] so the tenth and the seventeen picture
[1:11] knit you did the lecture you did the
[1:16] last one
[1:18] Louise Louise sorry
[1:27] so the tenth when you go and then
[1:32] everything oh nothing pants down second
[1:34] time go member then right and the
[1:38] seventeen will get somebody out so many
[1:40] good alright anyway we're good now we
[1:44] then that are strong I'll compare the
[1:47] infirmities of the weak and not to
[1:51] please ourselves in other words what
[1:52] does that mean let's don't please people
[1:54] just to take advantage up yeah okay be
[1:58] careful don't come we'll try to take
[2:00] advantage of the weak just bear with
[2:02] them let everyone of us please his
[2:04] neighbor for it's good to edification or
[2:06] in a much more being built up you don't
[2:19] do that now
[2:20] yes for even Christ please the whole
[2:24] self but as it has written the
[2:26] reproaches of them that reproached thee
[2:28] fell on me
[2:29] in other words Christ didn't come for
[2:30] itself none at all he did not come to
[2:32] this earth for his self you have to eat
[2:35] you have to be good when he hit this
[2:39] earth it was for one purpose and that
[2:40] was to get a people to save a group of
[2:43] people that was on the earth and and
[2:46] then take them back into the into the
[2:48] eternity three came from so Christ damn
[2:51] pleases they let me he didn't know where
[2:54] did he he took plays or nothing and we
[2:58] read that in the Old Testament where
[3:01] that everything was on him I mean the
[3:04] whole reproach of the world was on top
[3:05] of this man named Jesus for whatsoever
[3:08] things are written were written
[3:10] aforetime or before were written for our
[3:12] learning in other words the Old
[3:15] Testament were written for our learning
[3:16] that we through patience income
[3:19] another scripture might have hope now
[3:22] remember Paul wants to saw a revelation
[3:26] here because remember the New Testament
[3:31] hadn't been written when Paul's writing
[3:36] this to the Roman if there's nothing
[3:37] called a New Testament a book Macky
[3:40] Martley got another no now they may have
[3:42] been written but what I'm saying is Paul
[3:44] didn't have his hands on it once he
[3:45] talking about then he said we should get
[3:47] them from the Old Testament right where
[3:50] we read of wars and eye-for-an-eye and
[3:52] you know kill this one and you know take
[3:55] this one out and you know but you guys
[3:57] see the love of God in there somewhere
[3:59] because that's what he says we're ready
[4:01] for time we're written for our learning
[4:02] that we through patience and comfort of
[4:05] the Scriptures might have hope
[4:07] now we say that with the old end of New
[4:10] Testament so we have hope with both the
[4:13] old and the New Testament so now the god
[4:17] of patience and thank God he's got
[4:20] pictures and consolation ones
[4:22] consolation comforting grant you to be
[4:26] like-minded one toward another according
[4:27] to Christ Jesus Louie did you do the
[4:31] last sentence go I'll look back and save
[4:34] us and what do you own you word Bob one
[4:36] day okay okay Pollock owning this thing
[4:48] well Broncos gonna do the 10th of March
[4:51] so well Joe's gonna do the 10th of March
[4:56] so you're gonna do the 17th while I'm
[4:57] going the Philippines March 17th okay if
[5:00] you can't find something yeah
[5:03] it's all of you brother now the patience
[5:06] and consolation grant you to be
[5:08] like-minded one toward another according
[5:10] to Christ Jesus that you may with one
[5:13] mind and one mouth glorify God even the
[5:17] father of our Lord Jesus Christ one mine
[5:22] one mile there's only one word we must
[5:26] have singleness of heart
[5:28] I was thinking yesterday you even even
[5:32] in the greatest message that ever was
[5:33] given even when the Lord Jesus from
[5:36] giving in itself of course you can't
[5:39] really put them two together because
[5:41] they didn't have the Holy Ghost but now
[5:42] we're supposed to have the Holy Ghost in
[5:44] the end time and we're supposed to have
[5:45] all things together and and right and
[5:50] you know all things going in the right
[5:52] direction and you see it you're scared
[5:53] like shotgun blasts we're honest though
[5:55] there's something going on here and I
[5:57] know what it is those two spirits it's
[5:59] working in the framework of the church
[6:01] messy church not just Church out junga
[6:04] it's not that the Antichrist is not out
[6:06] there Antichrist is right here bro come
[6:09] he's close to the word right
[6:12] wherefore received you one another as
[6:14] Christ also received us to the glory of
[6:17] God now I say that Jesus Christ was a
[6:21] minister of the circumcision for the
[6:24] truth of God to confirm the promise made
[6:26] into the father's now remember we went
[6:27] through all that learning about
[6:29] circumcision and non circumcision
[6:31] remember Jesus came to the Jews first
[6:34] which was of the circumcision right but
[6:38] now you got to remember it wasn't the
[6:40] circumcision of the foreskin of the of
[6:42] the male anymore it's the foreskin of
[6:44] your heart so we all have circumcision
[6:47] of the heart because it's from the truth
[6:49] of God
[6:50] you'd be circumcised all your life and
[6:52] don't go to hell millions in billions
[6:54] well but so that has nothing to do with
[6:56] it right but when Christ came he
[6:58] ministered to the circumcision he went
[7:00] to the people of youth for the truth of
[7:03] God to confirm the promise made unto the
[7:05] father's but what did they do with
[7:07] turned him down they turn Christ down I
[7:11] mean they even look the ones he came to
[7:14] the ones that circumcision that the
[7:16] Bible spoke of and that the Gentiles
[7:20] might glorify God for it's mercy what
[7:22] the uncircumcised as it is written for
[7:27] this cause I will confess to the among
[7:29] the Gentiles and sing unto thy name
[7:32] they'll remember Paul's talking to the
[7:33] Romans so he's going to the Gentiles
[7:36] telling the Gentiles that Christ came to
[7:38] die for them - he didn't just come to
[7:40] die for the Jews he came to town for
[7:41] everybody yes all right and again he
[7:46] says rejoice ye Gentiles with his people
[7:50] do you think Jin tiles together rejoice
[7:52] together with each other
[7:54] because remember Paul comes up just in
[7:59] the natural story Paul comes up and he's
[8:02] trying to convert the Jews and they saw
[8:05] word already of circumcision and then he
[8:08] goes and says well we're going to
[8:10] convert the Gentiles now were there not
[8:12] a certainty you know he-man was a it
[8:17] only took a master Paul prophet a
[8:18] property called Paul that could stand
[8:20] with the Jews and say yes I know cuz I'm
[8:22] a circumcision I've come under that I've
[8:25] lived that all my life but now God has
[8:28] turned to the Jews coming to the
[8:29] Gentiles and he wants us to be together
[8:33] but then they just keep doing the
[8:35] separate come I get the message
[8:37] you don't you bringing together in
[8:39] separate and again he said where George
[8:41] can talk with his people and again
[8:43] praise the Lord all you Gentiles and
[8:45] laud him all you people and again I was
[8:48] asked that that she'll be a root of
[8:50] Jesse and he that shall rise to reign
[8:52] over the Gentiles and him shall the
[8:53] Gentiles trust because remember we're
[8:57] Nations there's only a little bitty
[8:59] group right now that called jente I mean
[9:01] it's called Jews that are real Jews and
[9:03] they're over in Israel little bitty of
[9:06] microcosm compared to the billions of
[9:08] others the billions of the other
[9:10] Gentiles all right excuse me
[9:14] and the Gentile bride is going to
[9:16] totally outnumber
[9:17] totally outnumbered the yellow : yes
[9:22] totally outnumbered the the Jews totally
[9:28] so that's what he said look he said
[9:31] again I'm destined there should be a
[9:32] ruby I see and he that shall rise to
[9:33] reign over the Gentiles and him shall
[9:36] the Gentiles trust now the god of Hope
[9:40] fill you with all joy and peace and
[9:42] believing that you may abound in hope to
[9:44] the power of the Holy Ghost and I myself
[9:48] also am persuaded of you my brethren
[9:51] none who didn't present confident then
[9:55] he also are full of goodness filled with
[9:57] all knowledge able also to admonish one
[10:00] another and that's what we do is we go
[10:03] up the stack of a perfect man you
[10:06] learned these things you are what we're
[10:08] learning we're learning how to let God
[10:11] control we're learning how to let go
[10:13] it's not common it's not common to let
[10:16] the Lord lead us hello somebody done
[10:17] right it's not you're a born contrary to
[10:20] God your morning on the other side yes
[10:22] we've got to learn and bring this whole
[10:25] nature it's like this Oh nature's gonna
[10:27] die become a new nature but you still
[10:30] got that little bit inside that you're
[10:32] gonna work on they're still trying to
[10:33] pull you in this direction right all
[10:35] right and that's our problem when we get
[10:37] this thing all upright then we're going
[10:39] around we'll take a body shame and then
[10:42] going around nevertheless brethren I
[10:45] have written the more boldly unto you in
[10:47] some sort as putting you in mind because
[10:50] of the grace that is given to me Oh God
[10:53] now what's he saying nevertheless I have
[10:57] written more boldly unto you in some
[10:59] sort as putting you in mind because of
[11:01] the grace that is given to me of God
[11:03] that I should be the minister of Jesus
[11:05] Christ to the Gentiles ministering the
[11:08] gospel of God is telling the Romans that
[11:10] they said you're getting a message I'm
[11:11] bringing you a message boldly bringing
[11:14] your message I'm the one that's
[11:15] delivering it that the offering up of
[11:20] the Gentiles might be acceptable being
[11:23] sanctified by the Holy Ghost see he's
[11:25] still dealing with those oh jesus is
[11:27] they're dogs
[11:28] they're dirty they're
[11:30] thing Gentiles are just filthy people
[11:33] but Paul sands look sanctified by the
[11:36] Holy Ghost it's like when Peter had that
[11:39] vision of those dirty animals coming
[11:42] down and he said never even you them and
[11:45] the Holy Ghost is like huh you gonna eat
[11:48] that you're going to the Gentiles you're
[11:51] gonna eat that I've never laid down you
[11:54] know what Peter says I don't that was a
[11:56] Gentile die out there but you don't you
[11:57] know that I don't ever do that God said
[12:00] now we're gonna save to file that yes
[12:02] and you're gonna be able to eat it so
[12:04] he's gonna be able to partake and then
[12:06] take it to the to the to the Gentile we
[12:11] just don't comprehend sometimes you said
[12:12] think about it we don't comprehend there
[12:15] was a total division between the Jews
[12:17] and the Gentiles because the Jews were
[12:20] God's chosen nation leave us alone
[12:22] your own uncircumcision you're dying and
[12:24] going to hell every one of you right the
[12:26] whole world and they still think that
[12:28] but think about it back then you know
[12:31] where you come up to a place to where
[12:32] we're God's people we have the Old
[12:35] Testament our Messiah's coming to us he
[12:38] ain't coming to y'all right I am a
[12:40] massage coming to us he's not a truck
[12:42] he's not even promised to come to you
[12:44] and he wasn't even promised to come to
[12:45] his own people and we'll get into that
[12:48] this afternoon back to that fifth seal
[12:50] where God blinded the the Jews he
[12:54] literally had to put them in blindness
[12:57] so that you and I could come in he had
[13:00] that's why he had to give that 50 of you
[13:02] eternal life that's why he asked through
[13:04] two prophets preached to open the eyes
[13:06] of 144,000 because if they like been for
[13:09] that they went to bed no day and 70
[13:11] weeks with a gap in the middle it would
[13:13] have been totally the Jews all the way
[13:15] through God would have took him in Iraq
[13:16] took them in a a rapture and they
[13:18] have been living in the kingdom so that
[13:22] Paul's trying to break that wall down
[13:25] between the Jews and and the Gentiles
[13:29] and it probably was hard for him he was
[13:31] born a Jew I'm the chosen of God
[13:35] you know I've chosen of God but when he
[13:38] got struck down and he said I'm Jesus
[13:41] who you persecuted he knew he was
[13:42] persecuting Jesus through them people
[13:44] yeah so he knew where Christ was at
[13:46] least he knew at that moment where
[13:47] Christ was and I'm sure he had a he had
[13:51] some suede palm moments wondering what
[13:54] God's gonna do kill him but what did God
[13:57] do got turned that thing around opened
[13:59] his eyes to the Gentile shinning to the
[14:01] Gentile made him a prophet and wrote
[14:02] eighty percent of New Testament through
[14:04] that man so hallelujah was that wrote
[14:08] eighty percent of the New Testament
[14:08] through the guy that was going to kill
[14:10] the most of the New Testament because he
[14:13] attacked whatwhat's the people you know
[14:14] at that time then you testimony he was
[14:17] he hated that new testimony he didn't
[14:19] hear them talk about Jesus and he'd
[14:21] wanted just to cut the throat look what
[14:23] he's doing them that I should be the
[14:26] minister of Jesus Christ to the
[14:27] ministering the gospel of God that the
[14:30] offering up of the Gentiles might be
[14:32] acceptable you still gotta preach it
[14:36] they gotta accept them being sanctified
[14:38] by the Holy Ghost I have therefore where
[14:43] of I have therefore aware of I made
[14:46] glory through Jesus Christ and those
[14:47] things which pertain to God for I will
[14:50] not dare to speak of any of those things
[14:52] which Christ hath not wrought by me to
[14:56] make the Gentiles obedient by word
[14:57] indeed my love what he said I will not
[14:59] dare speak anything because you know for
[15:03] a fact remember him and Peter had a
[15:07] problem not with doctrine they had a
[15:09] problem with the way Peter was treating
[15:10] some of the Gentiles and the way Peter
[15:12] was doing some things all right so
[15:15] what's he saying here I will not dare to
[15:16] speak to many of those things which
[15:18] Christ Christ has not wrought by me in
[15:19] other words to make the Gentiles
[15:21] obedient
[15:22] some over here in the Jews are going
[15:24] well let's just be a
[15:26] a little while and you know you gotta
[15:27] sell on Sam and let's go circumcise them
[15:30] all see how they walk they and you know
[15:33] and they're you know being older but no
[15:35] policy no I'm not gonna do anything that
[15:39] God didn't tell me to do to the Gentiles
[15:41] we're not going to dispute over what
[15:45] this one says and that will say you got
[15:47] to go by the Word of God to make the
[15:49] Gentiles obedient but-but-but what I
[15:52] always think about is here's the
[15:54] Gentiles over here gladly receiving the
[15:57] message gladly receiving Paul and Peter
[16:00] calling they met you never saw anywhere
[16:02] oh you had you little ones like Simon
[16:06] the sorcerer and some of them but they
[16:07] wanted what they had but you don't see
[16:10] the Old Testament I mean the the
[16:12] Gentiles trying to beat up on a Tuesday
[16:14] it was always the Jews was the one that
[16:16] was cutting off the Gentiles and sending
[16:17] them out they were dogs and they were
[16:18] all that so but you know what's the
[16:21] difference is they were sanctified by
[16:25] the Holy Ghost all right they were
[16:27] sanctified by the Holy Ghost the
[16:29] Gentiles work and so we're some of the
[16:32] Jews what there was only a small amount
[16:35] command can you imagine from the time of
[16:38] the day of Pentecost
[16:39] that's what pit Paul's dealing with here
[16:41] at you know after the day of Pentecost
[16:43] man they just went out into the world
[16:46] spreading the gospel at all even the
[16:48] disciples went into all different
[16:50] different parts of the world for I will
[16:54] not dare to speak of any of those names
[16:55] witchcraft that's not wrong by me to
[16:57] make the Gentiles obedient by word and
[16:59] deed in other words we're not gonna beat
[17:00] them to death
[17:01] we're gonna preach the word what they go
[17:04] through mighty signs and wonders by the
[17:06] power of the Spirit of God that's the
[17:08] only way to win somebody all right so
[17:12] that from Jerusalem and round about it
[17:15] until alike room I have fully preached
[17:18] the gospel of Christ
[17:19] yay so I have strived to preach the
[17:22] gospel not where Christ was named less I
[17:25] should build up another man's foundation
[17:27] know where he's preaching Christ him
[17:29] preaching somebody else he's preaching
[17:31] Christ that's thing we were you enough
[17:33] was that but as it is written to them he
[17:36] has not spoken of they shall see and
[17:39] they too have not heard shall understand
[17:43] all right so we were not spoken of
[17:49] Gentiles most of them didn't see Christ
[17:52] know you and I had seen Christ right but
[17:57] we've seen through signs and wonderful
[17:58] by the preaching of the word of God and
[17:59] all the different things that Christ did
[18:01] die for us they shall see and they that
[18:04] have not heard shall understand they
[18:07] didn't hear about Jesus until after he
[18:08] left their into their hearing about
[18:10] Christ through somebody and that's the
[18:12] way it's supposed to be the seed comes
[18:15] to the life comes through the body
[18:16] I was thinking yesterday about some
[18:21] things maybe for later home but you know
[18:24] Christ ahead is great greatest of all
[18:28] but you know a brain without a body is
[18:31] useless
[18:32] totally useless doesn't matter how many
[18:35] receptors that brain sends down into
[18:37] that body if there's nothing but a hair
[18:39] set on the table there's no hand to move
[18:41] yeah even though the brain says hand
[18:43] moved if there's no handling if there's
[18:46] nobody there no foot you wouldn't say
[18:51] it's useless but it would be useless in
[18:54] in forwarding something it would be used
[18:56] within doing something that's why Christ
[18:58] is ahead and he had to have a body and
[19:00] have a body called a bride cuz this is
[19:03] where the receptors when his brain fires
[19:05] and tells the hand to move then the hand
[19:08] move or defeat moves or whatever we want
[19:10] to do if I understand that that's how
[19:12] important you are
[19:13] because Christ look tell me what Christ
[19:17] did on the earth when he was here how
[19:18] many people did he say zero yeah he had
[19:25] no body on the earth he saved no one
[19:28] while he was here right all right oh
[19:31] yeah I go and send the war into all
[19:33] these things sure he did there was no
[19:36] one that he birthed
[19:38] while he was here right zero
[19:42] because really I want to be real clear
[19:45] with this his body is his bride and that
[19:47] alone the 144,000 the Jews the people
[19:50] the foolish virgin the ones here to give
[19:52] me eternal life
[19:53] that's not his body his body is only
[19:56] connected to the head his body is his
[20:00] bride and that's the born-again
[20:03] believers with eternal life in their
[20:04] soul there was only on the day of
[20:06] Pentecost 120 of his body began to be
[20:09] built on the day of Pentecost
[20:11] so that's how important you are to hear
[20:13] the bride and all down through the ages
[20:15] he had to have a body to work through
[20:17] yes you know what he can decide that
[20:20] because he's God that's what he said so
[20:23] we just got to believe when he said like
[20:25] Paul preach the gospel the gospel tells
[20:27] us he God needs the body he told us he
[20:29] needed a body
[20:30] the hand without the foot it's nothing
[20:32] this without that's nothing well but -
[20:34] now remember your body without a head
[20:38] totally useless right it's actually dead
[20:41] okay because really I mean you can live
[20:45] if you stay with your spine you can live
[20:47] if you if your brain can get the
[20:49] functions to your organs but you just
[20:51] can't move anything well that's what
[20:53] happened I believe that's what happened
[20:55] what savings done he's paralyzed the
[20:57] body he's paralyzed a lot of the body we
[21:00] need to lift the head and the hand work
[21:02] together brother bear said one time you
[21:04] don't think feet moving your hand move
[21:07] now as we get older that might be that
[21:11] may be true feet moving did something
[21:14] else happen don't we got another day and
[21:18] he said he's an older gentleman he said
[21:21] I can't get my favorite move when I
[21:23] wanna do some I say so myself but that's
[21:30] just - spot looking at a falling body
[21:32] but let's look at the body a crash which
[21:33] is never cloud the way it works way it's
[21:36] supposed to work all right
[21:38] but as it is ready to whom he was not
[21:41] spoken though they shall see and they
[21:42] too have not heard shall understand for
[21:45] which cause also I have been hindered
[21:48] from the coming from coming to you why
[21:50] it was hindered because the people said
[21:52] I you don't need to go to them you don't
[21:54] think my they were Romans they were boy
[21:55] are you talking about see here's the
[21:58] situation
[21:59] this is my father Paul's Jew
[22:02] he even being a Jew was under Roman rule
[22:06] since he was a baby all the way up this
[22:10] adulthood Rome had ruled Jerusalem and
[22:14] now he's fixin to go to the people they
[22:18] told them what to do for all they knew
[22:20] that ruled over him so it's a it's a
[22:23] paradox that Paul was going to the
[22:25] Romans that that literally killed the
[22:28] Jews I mean really wrong so I put Christ
[22:30] on the cross it wasn't no it was a no it
[22:32] was a Roman way of torture not a Jewish
[22:35] leg torture okay but now we know the
[22:37] Jews drew the Jews excuse me put them on
[22:40] the cross but we called all that I have
[22:43] been hindered from coming to you but now
[22:46] having no moral place in these parts and
[22:49] having the great desire these many years
[22:50] become of you he's getting ready so you
[22:52] don't have one more chapter so he's
[22:53] getting ready to tell him he's done in
[22:57] these parts he's sitting in Jerusalem
[22:59] writing this letter in other words my
[23:02] ministry here is not doing very good I'm
[23:04] supposed to go to Gentile there with
[23:05] many Gentiles in Jerusalem you've got to
[23:08] go gotta go out alright but now having
[23:11] normal place in these parts and having a
[23:12] great desire these many years to come
[23:14] unto you
[23:15] excuse me once so ever I take my journey
[23:18] into Spain I will come to you for I
[23:20] trust to see you in my journey and
[23:22] you've brought on my way then the work
[23:24] by you if first I be somewhat filled
[23:27] with your company though which he's
[23:29] going to visit
[23:30] he's just part of the letter he's right
[23:32] go but now I going to Jerusalem
[23:34] commencement to the Saints
[23:36] he's strengthened into present cover for
[23:39] it hath pleased them of Macedonia and
[23:41] occasion now that's out it's not in
[23:44] Jerusalem there they're a little bit
[23:46] further
[23:46] to make a certain contribution for the
[23:49] poor saints which are at Jerusalem
[23:50] because remember they're still getting
[23:52] persecuted week we forget that when we
[23:55] and I was thinking the same thing pretty
[23:57] much that when Paul was the biggest
[23:59] persecutor of the Jews right well when
[24:01] Paul gets converted moves away it
[24:03] settles down know they just somebody
[24:05] else took Paul's placement and started
[24:08] persecuting cuz remember all eleven of
[24:10] the twelve disciples were all killed
[24:13] Peter was nothing upside down one of
[24:15] them was pulled apart one was killed
[24:18] when I was killed by sword when I'm his
[24:19] head James his head was cut off John the
[24:22] back door the Revelator the only one
[24:23] that lived - for natural death yes
[24:29] saying it's horrible what happened to
[24:31] him but it was because they took the
[24:35] gospel so they were still persecution in
[24:39] Jerusalem for saints which are in
[24:41] Jerusalem I don't mean I don't know that
[24:42] that's poor and money-wise but maybe
[24:45] they were pouring doctrine it has please
[24:49] them fairly and their debtors they are
[24:51] for if the Gentiles have been made
[24:53] partakers of their spiritual thing their
[24:55] duty is also to minister unto them and
[24:57] carnal things alright take care of them
[25:01] in the carnal things or the change of
[25:03] nature and natural things material thing
[25:05] so I guess they are talking about the
[25:08] poor saints which they are poor take
[25:10] care of them and carnal things and in
[25:12] spiritual thing when therefore Clark's
[25:16] gone we probably tell the clock hey what
[25:18] time with you I'm JT yeah Tim okay thank
[25:20] you ma'am we have uh we have a b-flat
[25:29] with the first lesson than B even
[25:30] yesterday for about six or seven hours
[25:33] when we get several speakers and then
[25:36] there was a guy that would hold up
[25:37] you've got 15 minutes but man then
[25:38] people would go on I mean be for the
[25:40] camera and so you aim it so you have to
[25:44] hold up with time sheets since you got
[25:46] 15 minutes man you got
[25:47] man you got a five minute then one says
[25:49] shut up so we had literally take the
[25:55] Shepherd hook and drag them off the
[25:56] stage humans prefer filled with that
[25:58] hello when therefore I have performed
[26:01] this and have sealed sealed to them this
[26:04] fruit I will come by you into Spain what
[26:07] you talking about he's strengthening the
[26:09] people then he's going to Rome
[26:11] he's gonna strengthen sealed to them
[26:13] this fruit not apples and oranges okay
[26:17] and I ensure that when I come unto you I
[26:19] shall come in the fullness of the
[26:21] blessings of the gospel of Christ
[26:23] that's what brother brought him waiter
[26:25] don't remember he'd take them every day
[26:28] used to do he said he'd lay out all the
[26:29] requests and he'd pray old and then he
[26:33] would feel which one the Lord would lead
[26:34] him to go to and that's the same way
[26:37] with Paul you know the Bible said the
[26:41] footsteps of the righteous to order the
[26:42] Lord so we don't do things sometimes we
[26:44] think we do things forever listen we
[26:46] don't get any we don't get any benefit
[26:51] or anything out of it but you never know
[26:53] you'll know at the end you'll know when
[26:54] you get over there somebody way back in
[26:56] the back you could get a bless their
[26:58] soul and you know what that's worth the
[26:59] whole trip
[27:00] now the CT brethren for the Lord Jesus
[27:02] Christ thank them for the love of the
[27:04] Spirit that you strive together with me
[27:06] in your prayers to God for making them
[27:08] pray for me alright then I may be
[27:10] delivered from them that do not believe
[27:12] in you then they do not believe don't
[27:14] believe in Judea but don't believe that
[27:17] are in Judea right and that my service
[27:20] in Judea that's Jerusalem there's none
[27:25] believers did you have yes they are and
[27:28] that my service which I have for
[27:30] Jerusalem may be accepted of the Saints
[27:33] that I may come unto you with joy by the
[27:35] will of God and may with you be
[27:38] refreshed now the God of peace be with
[27:41] you all amen
[27:44] then he this is a continuation of this
[27:47] letter I'm commanding to use BB our
[27:50] sister which is a servant of the church
[27:52] which is that
[27:54] since shrimp that you receive her in the
[27:57] lord as becoming Saints and your sister
[28:00] and whatsoever business she has need of

[28:20] place grief or Silvana Killa which was
[28:24] the two tentmakers Priscilla in the
[28:25] killer my helpers in Christ Jesus who
[28:29] have for my life laid down their own
[28:33] necks if you'll remember back then some
[28:36] of the other Gospels there was a
[28:39] disputation one day about Paul and I
[28:41] think they were getting ready to stone
[28:42] him and I think Priscilla and the killer
[28:44] stepped up because they were businessmen
[28:45] women
[28:46] Tim makers and even employed Paul so
[28:50] they were friends and business partners
[28:51] not maybe business partners of Paul work
[28:53] form alright and then they they got him
[28:57] out of trouble so there's the Lord has
[28:59] people sitting in you know think about
[29:01] this all the people in your life that
[29:04] that God's put in your direction that
[29:07] has helped you and guided you may not

[29:40] advice in that same way with the killer
[29:41] of Brazil they help Bob who have for my
[29:45] life weighed down their own necks and
[29:46] over that time when they walked out
