[19:30] father we thank
[19:31] you for your loving grace unto us we
[19:34] thank you for all things and we know
[19:37] that you give them to us freely all
[19:40] we've got to do is just say thank you
[19:42] for because you're a wonderful father
[19:44] and you you carry care for your people
[19:48] and Lord it's not our desires a lot of
[19:50] times that we want it's what you desire
[19:53] for us because it would always be
[19:56] fulfilled in that we would never uh be
[19:59] without the biggest portion of our of
[20:01] our desires being fulfilled because
[20:04] you're that much concerned with us and
[20:06] we ask you to just bless each one
[20:08] remember the sick among us remember
[20:10] these ones Lord that we've requested it
[20:13] has been today and just bless each one
[20:15] have your way with each and every one of
[20:17] us and guide us in Jesus name amen amen
[20:22] Revelations
[20:26] 34 and unto the Ang Angel of the Church
[20:28] of the lady ofand right these things
[20:31] sayth the amen the faithful and true
[20:33] witness the beginning of the creation of
[20:37] God and let's go to John we won't get
[20:40] part of this this morning but we lay a
[20:43] ground work for this afternoon but we
[20:47] want to go to John 14 we'll begin about
[20:49] the 11th verse you know this is Jesus
[20:52] declaring himself and who he is and his
[20:54] works and if you don't believe me
[20:56] believe the works you know verse 11
[20:59] believe me that I am in the father and
[21:01] the father in me or else believe me for
[21:03] the very work sake verily verely isolate
[21:06] in other words there's no excuse when
[21:08] you tell somebody something the way he
[21:11] would do and then God comes behind and
[21:14] vindicates that there's no excuse
[21:18] there's no point so then you're just
[21:20] that settles it other words he said if
[21:22] you can't believe me believe the works
[21:25] all right so then that's way we ought to
[21:27] be in the message the hour right verily
[21:29] verily I say unto you he that believeth
[21:32] on me the works that I do shall he do
[21:34] also and Greater Works than these shall
[21:37] he do because I go with my unto my
[21:40] father now he's going to the father and
[21:42] he'll declare that but now this
[21:44] afternoon we're going to have to drop it
[21:45] back cuz remember the disciples had
[21:49] power to cast out Devils heal the sick
[21:51] etc etc way before this situation comes
[21:54] into existence but we're reading this
[21:56] kind of like we're going to have a
[21:58] review and then a preview to a few
[22:01] things and and move it up in that form
[22:04] all right so look verse 13 and
[22:06] whatsoever you shall ask in my name that
[22:08] will I do that the father may be
[22:10] glorified in the son if you shall ask
[22:13] anything in my name I will do it if you
[22:16] love me keep my Commandments and I will
[22:19] pray the father and he shall give you
[22:20] another comforter that he may abide with
[22:23] you forever even the spirit of Truth Now
[22:27] who's the comt
[22:29] whom the L whom the world cannot receive
[22:32] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[22:34] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[22:37] you right there and watch now and shall
[22:40] be in you I will not leave you
[22:42] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[22:45] little while and the world seeth me no
[22:48] more but ye shall see ye see me because
[22:52] I live you shall live also now watch you
[22:55] at that day now that's this day righten
[22:58] okay we'll emphasize that this afternoon
[23:00] more but at that day you shall know that
[23:02] I am in my father and ye in me and I in
[23:08] you you may be seated the Lord add his
[23:10] Blessing to the reading of the word
[23:12] that's my favorite scripture on a
[23:14] thought that I've always tried to make
[23:17] to
[23:18] you to where you can understand because
[23:22] Jesus said at that
[23:25] day what
[23:28] you'll know right I am in the
[23:32] father and ye in
[23:34] me and I and you am like I say it's easy
[23:38] to understand him and us because of the
[23:41] new
[23:42] birth but remember he's
[23:45] saying you I in you but you in me all
[23:50] right now we're going to try to carry
[23:52] the thought over to where we can cut off
[23:54] this morning and then this afternoon
[23:57] we'll get in into uh what we're doing
[24:00] and that's the reason I chose to make
[24:02] kind of like a
[24:03] preview uh a review of a little and then
[24:06] preview some things that we will be
[24:09] covering and then we will drop back into
[24:12] that thought you know and uh you know I
[24:15] love the word of God it's to me it's
[24:18] it's the uh the greatest of anything you
[24:22] could ever think
[24:23] of and uh I I've never understood
[24:26] Mankind in his
[24:29] ways uh you know have you ever thought
[24:33] of it like this people say you know they
[24:35] say it about me they say well brother
[24:36] Dale you studied so much until you're
[24:40] just so deep we can't understand
[24:43] you well you know what I told my wife
[24:46] yesterday I've come to one
[24:50] conclusion the deeper you get into the
[24:53] word of God the more simpler it becomes
[24:58] amen all right the deeper you get into
[25:02] the word of God the more simpler so how
[25:04] what is the key to for it to be simple
[25:07] to be able to understand
[25:10] it right what's the key to being able to
[25:14] understand the
[25:16] word steady is to get into the word get
[25:20] as deep as you can get into it and then
[25:23] you'll see how much more simpler it is
[25:26] when once you come to point because
[25:29] that's what it is with me people say
[25:31] well I I can't understand you but let me
[25:34] ask you a
[25:35] question I mean a question containing
[25:38] say like people say brother brandham
[25:40] does this the brother brandham you know
[25:42] uh he revealed no no there no man can
[25:45] reveal anything to you now it takes the
[25:49] Lord Jesus Christ to reveal all right
[25:52] now what do you say then is being
[25:55] done I'd like to preach this this really
[25:58] to you what do you think about it what
[26:00] is being done you know I'm talking about
[26:02] what we've heard the message and the
[26:04] things and all of that and and uh what
[26:07] do you think about
[26:08] that do you realize that if it is true
[26:13] that you cannot interpret the
[26:17] word right it is not to be
[26:21] interpreted what is it to be it's to be
[26:26] believed yep well well brother Dale you
[26:28] don't think brother BR no brother
[26:29] brandham didn't interpret nothing to us
[26:32] the Lord Jesus said even my own life
[26:36] right
[26:37] amen that's paraphrasing it with the
[26:39] scripture you
[26:41] know my own
[26:43] life he said didn't reveal that that's
[26:47] right now then what are we
[26:50] doing why are we at church what are we
[26:52] what's the whole purpose of going to
[26:55] church and the
[26:56] things all right we believe it's for
[26:59] salvation right number one point okay
[27:03] all right that's settled now but from
[27:05] then on it's to be uh become the
[27:10] children of
[27:12] God all right
[27:14] then as I said if it's true that that
[27:18] nobody can reveal anything to
[27:21] you why do we need a fivefold
[27:24] Ministry why did we need a
[27:26] prophet why do we need the word
[27:30] written why do we need anything like
[27:34] that come
[27:37] on you know that there's no way I can
[27:41] interpret it to
[27:43] you right but now there's a lot of
[27:45] difference in the word
[27:48] interpret and explain
[27:52] right now did you get that there's a lot
[27:55] of difference between interpreting
[27:58] and explaining
[28:00] right all right
[28:06] now if you're going to be a
[28:09] doctor do you go to school for them to
[28:11] interpret how to do
[28:14] things now listen to the words I'm using
[28:16] come on do you go to learn how to that
[28:20] they can interpret it to
[28:23] you no you go to learn how they explain
[28:28] it to
[28:30] you
[28:32] right see there's a lot of difference in
[28:35] explaining something and interpreting
[28:38] it and brother brandham said it this way
[28:41] that a minister could only do one thing
[28:44] he said that's break the spell that
[28:47] Satan has over your eyes to where God
[28:51] can speak to
[28:53] you now that's all I try to do all right
[28:57] so then as I try to explain
[29:02] it it's not interpreting
[29:05] it well I think it's all the same word
[29:08] well that's okay you're not getting the
[29:10] point that's right you're not listening
[29:12] to my
[29:13] thought what is the thought nobody can
[29:17] interpret it takes the Holy Spirit to do
[29:20] the
[29:21] interpreting right
[29:23] right but we can try to explain it yes
[29:29] mhm and trying to explain
[29:33] it is not trying to interpret it come
[29:37] onen Hallelujah I'm trying to explain it
[29:40] the way that the Holy Spirit can
[29:42] interpret it right now in the medical
[29:46] realm as I said Doctor whatever you're
[29:49] going to school for whatever you're
[29:51] doing you know I mean a mechanic you go
[29:53] down to a mechanic and and you get a
[29:56] mechanic you get I go down and say
[29:57] Donnie I want to learn how to tear a
[29:59] motor apart and put it back together I
[30:01] want you to interpret that to
[30:04] me there's no such
[30:07] thing but I want you to explain to
[30:11] me how this is
[30:13] done and you know yourself that you're
[30:15] constantly growing in all Realms of life
[30:20] amen it doesn't matter if you're
[30:21] planting beans or holding a garden
[30:24] they're always coming up with a new hoe
[30:26] they're always coming up with a new a
[30:27] plant or a new seed or something but
[30:30] it's not trying to
[30:33] interpret so that's what we say to
[30:36] people
[30:37] right how many of you ever talk to
[30:39] somebody how many of you ever talk to
[30:41] somebody about their their hir it's cut
[30:44] and they say that's the way you what
[30:48] inter that's the way you interpret it
[30:51] you're not trying to interpret
[30:54] it right you're trying to expl explain
[30:58] why you have the long high right and
[31:04] that is not an
[31:06] interpretation that is the point you're
[31:08] trying to fulfill the word of God
[31:12] right if not why are you doing
[31:15] it right so then it's not say well
[31:18] that's your opinion no a lot of
[31:21] difference in opinion and trying to help
[31:24] somebody to understand something right
[31:28] that's why the trouble has been so much
[31:29] we've misinterpreted even our own human
[31:34] languages to where we don't understand
[31:37] see the Bible don't need anybody to
[31:39] interpret it brother brandham never come
[31:42] to interpret the Bible we we've never
[31:44] taught nothing like that or believe
[31:45] nothing of that way
[31:48] right you said yeah but what about this
[31:51] thing what about this thing what about
[31:54] that he come to explain it that's right
[31:59] to where God could reveal
[32:01] it right you see other there things in
[32:04] the Bible now watch my point then this
[32:08] Bible that we
[32:10] have
[32:12] right we claim to be the word of God
[32:16] right you know the Bible never taught a
[32:19] Trinity
[32:22] right but we interpret it as doing that
[32:28] right come
[32:30] on be sensible we interpreted it as
[32:34] being a
[32:37] trinity it never taught that hell was
[32:41] eternal we interpreted
[32:45] that right and we tried to explain
[32:49] it but it didn't do much good did
[32:53] it right are you following me yes see
[32:57] the Bible then is not
[33:00] deep how could it be
[33:03] deep if God is the one to reveal
[33:08] it I thought we believe that Jesus said
[33:14] did he hid
[33:15] it from the wise and The
[33:17] Prudent but would reveal
[33:20] it or not in the scripture written out
[33:23] there but reveal it unto babes such as
[33:26] would Lear
[33:28] that's not an interpreting of that
[33:30] that's explaining
[33:32] it a lot of difference in explaining and
[33:37] interpreting
[33:39] right you see we say brother random came
[33:42] to interpret the Bible to
[33:45] us now come on you say well I've got
[33:47] quotes yeah I have two I like to
[33:50] read he said a prophet would interpret
[33:54] now watch I well there's the word
[33:56] interpreting you should interpret but
[33:58] what did he
[34:00] say interpret what was written in his
[34:03] own
[34:08] life come on read the
[34:12] message a prophet would interpret what's
[34:15] written in his own life how can you
[34:17] explain
[34:22] anything you can only explain what's
[34:24] written in your life amen right
[34:27] that's right so you understand what I'm
[34:29] saying we say
[34:32] interpret there's no such thing as to
[34:36] interpret the Bible said what come on am
[34:39] I quoting brother
[34:42] Bram the Bible said a virgin shall
[34:46] conceive now who interpreted
[34:52] that there was no
[34:54] one in the world could interpret that
[34:59] right cuz how can a virgin conceive now
[35:02] don't get into garbage with me about
[35:05] artificial semination and things get out
[35:07] of that see your smart elic brain is
[35:09] what's running into people
[35:11] off get what I'm saying
[35:14] yes when the Bible said a virgin shall
[35:20] conceive there's a lot of difference in
[35:22] conceiving and artificial
[35:24] insemination right right
[35:28] come on but
[35:31] listen it don't need to be interpreted
[35:33] it needed
[35:35] somebody to believe
[35:37] it
[35:39] right and make alive what was in their
[35:41] own life is that what mury done be it
[35:45] unto me according to Thy word
[35:50] amen where was the
[35:55] interpretation the five word that
[35:59] brought forth a
[36:01] body what is it in this message that is
[36:07] deep sure I agree with you 100% in your
[36:11] thinking the way it's done by a lot of
[36:13] people trying to interpret it it don't
[36:15] work too good right but I'm trying to
[36:19] tell you that that's not
[36:21] right
[36:23] right yeah we got two boys there now one
[36:26] little and one big one now if we have
[36:29] any fights I'll take the little
[36:32] one good to see
[36:35] boys listen these little Fells come up
[36:38] from way down there with you
[36:42] know but listen church do you understand
[36:45] what I'm getting at
[36:47] yes brother random never come to
[36:49] interpret the Bible do you and I
[36:53] right he couldn't do
[36:55] it
[36:57] he came to
[37:00] explain what was in his own
[37:03] life I thought we believe the Bible that
[37:06] it said the what the husband me what
[37:08] before the preacher can preach what does
[37:10] the Bible say about him the husbandmen
[37:12] must be what partakers of the
[37:16] fruit that's why there's a lot of things
[37:18] I don't preach on you know
[37:21] why because I don't know
[37:24] it is that sensible
[37:27] yeah right I don't know
[37:29] it I I wouldn't preach on the Statue of
[37:31] a perfect
[37:33] man until about 1982 or 80 something and
[37:38] brother moed preached it in 71 and 72
[37:42] but see I didn't understand how the
[37:43] virtues could be brought into a human
[37:46] body or a human
[37:49] person until the Lord revealed
[37:53] it he didn't interpret it he told me
[37:57] what it
[38:00] said add to your
[38:05] virtue well only thing I had to figure
[38:07] out was how did you get that to
[38:08] working you know how you figure out how
[38:10] to get that to working you listen to him
[38:13] and what did he say the opening of the
[38:16] word is what will bring these things
[38:18] into being am was that an interpretation
[38:22] no it was a
[38:25] revelation that wasn't something I tried
[38:27] to
[38:28] interpret it was something I could read
[38:32] right see what's wrong with the people
[38:34] of the message and the ministers
[38:36] especially is they're trying to
[38:38] interpret this message that's why you
[38:41] got all kind of garbage Canin
[38:43] doctrines two Soul 7th anniversary
[38:45] polygamy per of this you got scus of it
[38:48] and no wonder the people don't want to
[38:49] hear Brother Brown's
[38:53] message but see all I want you to know
[38:55] is one thing for sure I believe the
[38:59] message but if it don't bring Christ to
[39:02] you what good is the message
[39:06] right Y and brother random was so simple
[39:10] in bringing Christ show me something
[39:12] deep in this
[39:16] Bible there is nothing
[39:20] deep it's what we said that made it
[39:25] unexplainable
[39:27] when Jesus said I and my father are
[39:34] one they killed him
[39:38] right was that
[39:42] true that don't have to be interpreted
[39:44] does
[39:45] it what is it to interpret when you say
[39:48] I and my father's one that's right
[39:51] explaining
[39:53] yes explaining that God came into Christ
[39:56] that's not the
[39:58] interpretation cuz you can't interpret
[40:00] it when he said unless you believe that
[40:03] I am
[40:05] he he said you will die in your
[40:08] sins now where does that need to be
[40:12] interpreted what would be the
[40:17] interpretation but explaining how God
[40:21] brought it to
[40:24] Pi can bring to you and I the
[40:29] ability for God to reveal it to
[40:36] us I thought we needed a revelation more
[40:38] than
[40:39] anything I thought without a revelation
[40:42] and listen quoting it right I thought
[40:44] without a revelation the gates of hell
[40:46] would Prevail but I thought if it was a
[40:49] revelation the gates of hell can't
[40:51] Prevail now where does that need to be
[40:54] interpreted well brother random come
[40:56] into interpret these seals now wait a
[40:58] minute it was already in the Bible right
[41:01] that's right he didn't come to interpret
[41:03] it he come to explain
[41:07] it right it was already in the Bible
[41:09] that's
[41:11] right but people are looking for some
[41:14] mystery of how to explain it I mean how
[41:16] to interpret it oh that brother oh look
[41:20] at his
[41:24] interpretation we need to get away from
[41:26] the word interpretation and get down to
[41:30] explaining and then let God
[41:33] reveal because if we interpret God can't
[41:35] reveal listen if we interpret God does
[41:39] not have to
[41:43] reveal I thought the Revelation was the
[41:50] interpretation come on
[41:54] folks we say oh that's just so deep I
[41:57] can't understand it no it means you've
[42:00] never sat
[42:02] down and tried to understand you've
[42:06] tried to interpret it you've listened to
[42:09] what other people said to you and you
[42:12] took that as
[42:13] interpretations that's
[42:17] right brother R never come to interpret
[42:20] the
[42:21] Bible I gave you the quote there come on
[42:24] I'm with you a prophet cannot interpret
[42:29] the word but he can explain what's in
[42:31] his own
[42:33] life all right as I've said to you many
[42:36] times Martin
[42:38] Luther no telling how many times he
[42:40] preached on the J shall live by
[42:45] faith surely he must have been thinking
[42:47] about
[42:48] it you know there were a lot of people
[42:51] doing that and talking about that before
[42:53] Luther ever brought his message
[42:56] right there were many uh reformations
[43:00] that flew up before Luther came forth
[43:03] with his
[43:09] thesis but see one day it was revealed
[43:11] to
[43:12] him that's right that the just shall
[43:16] live by faith that was in his life right
[43:19] that was a part of him right then all he
[43:23] was ever trying to do was explain what
[43:25] he had inside of
[43:27] him
[43:31] right that should be what we all as
[43:33] ministers would strive to do not to
[43:36] interpret
[43:39] something but try to explain what is in
[43:41] our own
[43:46] lives because it's not in your life come
[43:48] on I quote you the scripture the HUD
[43:50] women must be first partakers of the
[43:53] fruit he's got to have it revealed to
[43:56] him before he can explain what is being
[44:01] said but see we we want to interpret we
[44:04] want something interpreted there there
[44:05] was no such
[44:07] thing it's explaining it when God
[44:11] reveals it that is the
[44:13] interpretation
[44:16] right you remember when you argued about
[44:18] the water
[44:22] baptism you remember when they told you
[44:24] about the somebody did about the water
[44:25] baptism
[44:26] that's just your way of seeing
[44:31] it but then when you lay it down and you
[44:34] express it in good
[44:37] terminologies
[44:40] that Father Son and Holy Ghost has to be
[44:43] Lord Jesus
[44:45] Christ
[44:47] amen is that an interpretation or
[44:51] Revelation first off if you think it's
[44:53] an interpretation you missed it second
[44:55] off if it's it's just head knowledge
[44:56] it'll do you no good cuz somebody else
[44:58] can argue out of the other things right
[45:01] right that's right but if it's a
[45:06] revelation you lot
[45:10] different
[45:12] right come on church we don't want to
[45:14] give it in the right order right you
[45:17] know that John Wesley got his message of
[45:21] the
[45:22] sanctification from the moravians every
[45:25] you pronounce the word word I that when
[45:27] he was coming to America to convert the
[45:31] Indians and he went back home saying L I
[45:34] went to America to convert the Indians
[45:36] and found out I needed to be converted
[45:39] myself that was what struck the world
[45:42] what was in his life that's
[45:45] right not an interpretation that's right
[45:49] that's right right right well how do you
[45:53] interpret that I hope you remember
[45:55] remember that and next time somebody
[45:57] comes along and says how do you
[45:59] interpret that you explain what I just
[46:03] said right you say I can't interpret it
[46:08] you can't interpret it what does it
[46:13] say what does it say you understand what
[46:17] I'm getting at see the Bible didn't
[46:18] change when the prophet
[46:21] came we already had the Bible book forms
[46:25] and things
[46:26] right before the prophet came on the
[46:31] scene which is trying to express what
[46:34] the word
[46:36] says
[46:39] right there's a lot of difference then I
[46:41] hope you understand that a lot of
[46:42] difference between
[46:45] explaining and
[46:52] interpreting so the next time somebody
[46:54] said that's the way you interpreted said
[46:55] I'm not trying interpret it cuz I
[46:57] can't and neither can
[47:00] you we said you explain your Trinity to
[47:02] me
[47:05] now come on right you explain your
[47:08] Trinity to me and then we'll see whether
[47:10] it matches up with the word of God or
[47:14] not see there there never was a trinity
[47:20] taught until the Catholic church and the
[47:22] things coming along about 325 ad is
[47:25] where they begin to and that's first I
[47:26] see in Council and that's where they
[47:28] begin to bring forth the idea and really
[47:32] it didn't get developed at 325 because
[47:35] basically 325 ad was when it came forth
[47:38] that the the uh the man or whatever his
[47:41] name was it was two guys arguing over
[47:44] whether Jesus was God or a like
[47:46] substance all right that was the basic
[47:49] reason of the 325 ad and if you will get
[47:52] the 325
[47:54] ad go in your in in your computer when
[47:58] you get home and run in 3:25 ad and read
[48:02] the announcement they made from
[48:06] that the proclamation and announcement
[48:09] was made from 3:25 ad that Jesus is the
[48:13] very substance of
[48:16] God but see they done got the idea
[48:19] planted into the man's mind you
[48:23] know by 606 had done developed right
[48:29] yep am I deep cuz I read
[48:34] that brother Dale he just how well why
[48:37] don't you go read
[48:42] it then you might find out that what I
[48:44] said's
[48:48] right but you see the Bible doesn't need
[48:51] no
[48:53] interpretation no man whatsoever ever
[48:55] has a right to interpret it come on
[48:57] listen if brother brandham had a right
[48:59] to interpret then he could have went to
[49:01] p on patmas and took that
[49:05] book you know what I'm talking about
[49:07] where John talking about who's worthy to
[49:09] take the book
[49:13] right come on you know what I'm talking
[49:16] about it's true you know that the
[49:17] biggest portion of people of this
[49:18] message believe brother brandom would
[49:19] have been worthy to went and took that
[49:22] book I say no sir re
[49:27] no man the Bible said was
[49:31] worthy the only one man that was worthy
[49:34] was the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[49:37] wouldn't have been worthy if he hadn't
[49:38] been
[49:39] God right
[49:42] oh yeah you
[49:45] know you know why I love to read the
[49:47] Bible I I like to think about the way
[49:50] people think you know and then I try to
[49:51] read you know Jesus was one in the Bible
[49:53] said there's none good no no one right
[50:00] right and why would he say that when he
[50:02] was the one
[50:04] good he knew fleshly speaking that the
[50:08] devil was working within those
[50:10] Realms of
[50:13] him that's right and there was nothing
[50:16] he could be tempted and tested there was
[50:18] nothing within
[50:20] that even though it was virgin born but
[50:23] it wasn't Eternal right
[50:26] amen see then he says there's nothing
[50:28] good no not
[50:33] one it wasn't degrading his own self he
[50:36] was telling it like it is that's right
[50:38] does that need to be interpreted no that
[50:39] needs to be
[50:42] believed
[50:45] right now come on you know we talk about
[50:49] we believe R random was the prophet and
[50:51] thank God we believe those things but
[50:53] yet he was not our God that's righten
[50:55] amen we don't worship him we don't have
[50:58] nothing with that that's
[51:05] right but we believe that God used a man
[51:08] to bring us a
[51:09] message right come on you out there
[51:12] anywhere
[51:14] listening where was anybody else for the
[51:21] message come on you got your o Rober you
[51:23] got your billy Grahams you got all of
[51:24] this that the other but where was one of
[51:26] them with a
[51:27] message oh yeah you got quotes you got
[51:30] doctrines you got ideas and and all the
[51:32] different things right but where was one
[51:35] of them to ever come with a message
[51:37] that's
[51:40] right right Billy Graham and asked him
[51:43] about the
[51:45] Trinity I read it one day from him you
[51:47] know what he
[51:48] said he said it can't be
[51:53] understood that's what he said amen
[51:56] you know what I agree with you there's
[51:58] no way to understand a trinity I agree
[52:01] with him
[52:02] 100% CU there three of them which one's
[52:05] oldest who created who that's not
[52:07] interpreted that's simply Plain Talk you
[52:11] understand what I'm getting
[52:15] there see we think that we have the
[52:22] interpretation come on I can quote to
[52:24] you brother R says we have the
[52:26] uh the interpretation in the divine
[52:28] revelation is that the word there's a
[52:29] quote similar to that we
[52:32] do why because God has brought it to us
[52:35] what is the interpretation of the Bible
[52:38] the word being fulfilled or Made Alive
[52:40] in somebody's life
[52:43] Mary was the interpretation of
[52:48] Genesis what
[52:51] 3:15 I'll put between thee and I I seeed
[52:54] you know
[52:55] between thy seed and the serpent seed
[52:58] well brother randam come to interpret
[52:59] that to us as being the serpent no it
[53:01] didn't the Bible done told us what it
[53:03] was that's right the Bible told
[53:06] us that it was the seed of The Serpent
[53:10] and the seed of God
[53:13] right that's
[53:15] not needing an
[53:18] interpretation right that's a
[53:23] believing God never said those things we
[53:26] made him say
[53:31] it by our
[53:33] own interpretation within ourselves
[53:36] right we made him say
[53:39] it when he never said
[53:45] it come on when the first seal broke the
[53:48] prophet said that white horse
[53:51] rider was the
[53:54] Antichrist
[53:57] right and City he rides
[54:00] off all we needed to know what the
[54:03] Antichrist was all we needed to know or
[54:05] should have known what the devil
[54:10] was
[54:11] right so what did the prophet come to
[54:13] explain 30 something
[54:16] years to get us to see one true and
[54:19] living God we'll see that more this
[54:23] afternoon when we'll see this message
[54:25] has to constantly talking about the
[54:28] Bible the Bible has constantly been
[54:30] unfolding
[54:33] itself to where you and I can see it and
[54:37] understand
[54:38] it we don't need anybody to interpret it
[54:40] we need somebody to live
[54:43] it brother BR was one that said it I
[54:45] didn't he said if God could get one man
[54:47] in his hands he said he can do
[54:54] it well how come we can't believe that
[54:56] that I'm
[54:58] one you know like we make the joke out
[55:00] of it and it's not a joke but brother
[55:02] said one out of state right right and
[55:06] you know what he said on that he didn't
[55:08] put it one out of a state that was a
[55:10] quote from a person expressing how small
[55:13] it would be right that's
[55:15] right but if there is just one out of
[55:17] state then y'all going to have to
[55:20] move cuz I'm
[55:23] here huh does that need to be
[55:26] interpreted now it needs y'all to
[55:30] move
[55:32] right but listen church I'm trying to be
[55:34] sensible about the word of
[55:36] God this is something my wife and I were
[55:38] talking about yesterday or day before
[55:40] one was
[55:43] riding see it doesn't need to be
[55:47] interpreted it needs somebody to believe
[55:53] it and to believe it we had to have
[55:55] somebody to explain
[55:58] it there's where your prophets and your
[56:01] people come in the Bible was not rewrote
[56:05] when Luther come out and said to J shall
[56:07] live by faith it's what God had already
[56:11] said the disciples understood
[56:15] that
[56:18] right your disciples understood the just
[56:22] shall live by faith that's right
[56:25] that was not a new doctrine that Luther
[56:29] got it was a bringing back of the word
[56:32] of God that the disciples already
[56:34] understood but that mankind had taken
[56:37] away why because he started interpreting
[56:41] it and expressing his own
[56:50] ideas you see
[56:53] church we talk about that we're in the
[56:58] word you know we talk about we're in the
[57:03] word you see I I've been studying this
[57:06] message for 50 years this year because I
[57:10] heard of the message
[57:12] 1966 50 years of studying this
[57:19] message
[57:23] right what about
[57:27] it we've had 50 years almost a prophet
[57:31] gone
[57:36] right but yet we don't know what the
[57:38] prophet has taught
[57:39] us cuz we're still trying to find some
[57:46] interpretation it's like I told you you
[57:49] remember what happened back a few years
[57:50] ago when they found 40 24 tapes that
[57:53] brother randam of messages that they
[57:55] didn't know existed yes well you know
[57:59] everybody wanted them 24
[58:03] tapes well I did
[58:08] too but you know why most people wanted
[58:10] those 24 tape they thought some secret
[58:13] thing was going to be revealed and had
[58:16] been withholden from the bride of Christ
[58:18] until a certain
[58:20] time
[58:22] right no I just knew it' fit with the
[58:24] rest of it
[58:25] right right but one is deep see we talk
[58:29] about somebody preaching and say but but
[58:31] they're
[58:32] deep that means you don't
[58:35] understand cuz deep is simple
[58:40] right that brother's deep what do you
[58:42] mean
[58:45] deep I didn't know the word cat change
[58:48] languag is from Deep to
[58:52] shallow right
[58:55] I mean it's deep how do you spell cat
[58:58] and deep he said that's silly I know
[59:00] it's silly cuz that's the way our
[59:02] thoughts
[59:03] are we think something is
[59:08] deep like I told you about the brother
[59:10] told that time he said that statue of
[59:11] perfect man he said that adoption one of
[59:14] the way or the other that adoption is
[59:16] simple but said that statue of perfect
[59:17] man is deep well it's the same thing
[59:23] right we only make it deep because we're
[59:27] making it to where God cannot reveal
[59:30] it as I said how many times did Martin
[59:33] Luther preach the just shall live by
[59:35] faith
[59:39] right boy that's a deep
[59:41] thought then one day it struck him and
[59:44] God revealed it he said Glory Hallelujah
[59:46] that's what the whole Bible
[59:48] says he wasn't just arguing over one
[59:53] quote
[59:55] he tackled the world over that one
[1:00:00] scripture now listen you know what if he
[1:00:05] was
[1:00:06] right and we do believe he was right
[1:00:10] right now not all all of his things that
[1:00:11] he preached were going with it but if we
[1:00:13] believe that the just shall live by
[1:00:16] faith why are we still trying to explain
[1:00:18] it
[1:00:23] right
[1:00:29] right what does it mean there well we
[1:00:32] believe it means
[1:00:33] this but why can't we
[1:00:37] read like I said Matthew 5:2 548 where
[1:00:41] it says be ye therefore perfect even as
[1:00:42] your father in Heaven is perfect does
[1:00:45] that need to be
[1:00:50] interpreted no it's a fact that needs to
[1:00:52] be believed
[1:00:53] that's
[1:00:55] now to explain that we looked up the
[1:00:56] word and not done that in the Baptist
[1:00:58] Church I looked up the word
[1:01:02] perfect and I found out then that the
[1:01:04] word perfect means complete in a full
[1:01:13] age what was that not an interpretation
[1:01:16] but an
[1:01:21] explanation see that's what we need we
[1:01:24] need explanation right we've got to have
[1:01:27] explanation right but we can only have
[1:01:31] interpretation by explanations being
[1:01:37] revealed see when something is
[1:01:40] revealed into your life can the devil
[1:01:43] take it away from
[1:01:45] you now if it's
[1:01:49] revealed well does it need to be
[1:01:53] interpreted no
[1:01:55] you might try to explain it yes but it
[1:01:58] doesn't need to be
[1:01:59] interpreted the Virgin shall conceive
[1:02:01] doesn't need to be interpreted it needed
[1:02:04] somebody to make it
[1:02:06] alive now may I quote brother brandom
[1:02:09] every scripture in this Bible has been
[1:02:12] made Alive by
[1:02:17] someone cuz that's what it is what is
[1:02:20] the book that Wade's talking about in
[1:02:22] the Sunday School that was in the hand
[1:02:25] of the one sitting on the throne and
[1:02:26] they went and took a book was it a
[1:02:28] Thompson Chain a Scofield or
[1:02:32] a you know what I mean they come in
[1:02:35] existence a couple of hundred years or
[1:02:37] less than that for the SC field and the
[1:02:39] Thompson chains but King James versions
[1:02:41] or whatever was it a book setting
[1:02:45] there I
[1:02:48] thought that this Bible was a list of
[1:02:50] names of
[1:02:53] believers
[1:02:56] right I thought when it said Paul Peter
[1:02:59] James John that that was
[1:03:01] Believers that don't need to be
[1:03:03] interpreted does it it's Believers
[1:03:10] am then what was he
[1:03:13] taking a book cuz remember what he was
[1:03:16] taken was what went back before the
[1:03:17] foundation of world right where'd it go
[1:03:20] back to to him who gave it it didn't go
[1:03:23] to sat
[1:03:24] cuz he couldn't take it amen he went
[1:03:28] back to the one who gave it am
[1:03:33] right you see
[1:03:36] Church we're not taking it as
[1:03:41] being that we the message has come not
[1:03:45] to explain I mean not to interpret thing
[1:03:48] but to express what God has in his
[1:03:52] mind that's right
[1:03:54] amen you know what God had in his mind
[1:03:56] before the foundation of world had
[1:03:59] you we agree with
[1:04:02] that but see we get into it well but see
[1:04:05] we've been
[1:04:07] taught we've been taught in Old on that
[1:04:10] point right there see we'd say well your
[1:04:12] name was written in the lounge book of
[1:04:13] life before the foundation
[1:04:15] world I heard it explained that my name
[1:04:18] was written when I joined that
[1:04:20] church that's my
[1:04:23] interpretation
[1:04:26] that's a good old Baptist Doctrine
[1:04:28] that's right
[1:04:35] right lot of them believe old primi
[1:04:38] especially free wills and that when they
[1:04:40] wrote that name on that card that you
[1:04:42] joined that church that day your name
[1:04:44] was written in heaven that ain't never
[1:04:46] been in the Bible nowh
[1:04:50] whatsoever if it was
[1:04:52] written the Bible said it was written
[1:04:55] before the foundation of the world
[1:04:56] that's right it don't need to be
[1:04:57] interpreted does it nor to be believed
[1:05:01] that's right now explaining
[1:05:05] right see then we can explain the reason
[1:05:09] it's written there is because God would
[1:05:11] look down and see all of the
[1:05:14] names and that would be his people upon
[1:05:17] the Earth and that would be put in a
[1:05:19] book right that's explaining
[1:05:23] it okay retitle the message brother Joe
[1:05:26] take that off of review and preview put
[1:05:29] on
[1:05:31] there what explaining
[1:05:35] it cuz listen church what good does it
[1:05:39] do for us to have a message what good
[1:05:41] does it do for us to have a
[1:05:45] Bible if we don't believe it can be
[1:05:49] understood right now May I won't say
[1:05:54] what I just
[1:05:57] thought God wouldn't be so messed up
[1:05:59] would
[1:06:01] he I was going to say he wouldn't be too
[1:06:03] dumb but he wouldn't be so messed up as
[1:06:07] to not know
[1:06:10] everything right if there is a God if
[1:06:14] that's the way you believe him if you
[1:06:15] don't believe him that way that he knows
[1:06:17] all things then go ahead and forget
[1:06:19] it
[1:06:21] right but if he knows all things
[1:06:26] then he knew what we would do down
[1:06:27] through time and how we would do with
[1:06:30] our own ideas and how man would become
[1:06:32] so departed
[1:06:35] away right cuz listen folks let me take
[1:06:39] one
[1:06:41] explanation to get you to
[1:06:44] think the Bible says the cankerworm
[1:06:46] palmerworm Locust and caterpillar right
[1:06:50] over in Joel it would eat the thing down
[1:06:53] to a stump right
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:57] right they don't need interpreted what
[1:07:00] does it need to be done canor pal worm
[1:07:02] Locust caterpillar is the four stages of
[1:07:04] one bug what's the one bug plain
[1:07:06] language the devil in his doctrines and
[1:07:08] ideas right that don't need no
[1:07:10] interpreting right that means facts we
[1:07:14] just take an example of P canor pomor
[1:07:17] Locus caterpillar and explain it as a
[1:07:21] bug that's eating right cuz that was
[1:07:24] what was explained to the prophet all
[1:07:26] right now then we know that the four
[1:07:29] stages ate it
[1:07:31] down and we know there's four stages to
[1:07:34] Restoration
[1:07:37] right the bugs that ate it down what was
[1:07:41] it Luther brought the just shall live my
[1:07:47] faith Wesley brought
[1:07:50] sanctification right the Pentecostals
[1:07:53] brought the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:56] right and then what was the lies to be
[1:07:59] is the word or
[1:08:01] seed
[1:08:04] right come on to that to four stages
[1:08:06] back to the word pure unadulterated
[1:08:12] word all right then that means that
[1:08:16] Luther Wesley and Pentecost and the Holy
[1:08:20] Ghost was in the restoration to bring it
[1:08:23] back to us that don't need interpreting
[1:08:25] does it
[1:08:27] right that just needs to believe
[1:08:31] it neither does it need to be
[1:08:34] interpreted when your Prophet will
[1:08:37] say this
[1:08:40] way he takes those four stages of that
[1:08:43] bug and he brings it back to the
[1:08:47] word then he starts
[1:08:49] again and what does he
[1:08:52] say
[1:08:54] he said what the Lutheran left the
[1:08:58] Methodist
[1:09:00] ate Y what the Methodist lay the
[1:09:03] Pentecostals
[1:09:10] at does that need an
[1:09:12] interpretation we didn't need the
[1:09:14] interpretation to come up to the G War
[1:09:16] pal Locus cill we need an interpretation
[1:09:18] for the other can't you just plainly
[1:09:22] see
[1:09:24] what's he saying what the Methodist what
[1:09:26] the Lutheran left the Methodist ate
[1:09:34] up you see where our ideas is what's
[1:09:37] killing
[1:09:38] us that's why you turned in from the
[1:09:41] fact of
[1:09:42] restoration with Luther Wesley and
[1:09:45] Pentecost in the word and you turn back
[1:09:47] to what's called
[1:09:52] Reformation
[1:09:55] I'm just saying some things brother R
[1:09:57] said to illustrate that they don't need
[1:09:59] to be interpreted they need to be
[1:10:02] believed that's why they say you're so
[1:10:05] deep deep of
[1:10:07] what when a prophet has already explain
[1:10:10] the local cankerworm palor worm and all
[1:10:13] that and what they ate down and how God
[1:10:15] uses Luther Wesley and Pentecost and the
[1:10:18] word of God to restore then he drops
[1:10:20] right back down and
[1:10:22] says you people of this end time message
[1:10:25] have ate
[1:10:28] away you took your Lutheran ideas your
[1:10:31] Methodist ideas your Pentecostal
[1:10:35] ideas you've ate it down till it's a
[1:10:37] stump
[1:10:39] again
[1:10:41] right does that need to be interpreted
[1:10:47] no but you know what it needs somebody
[1:10:49] to do to believe it that's right and
[1:10:53] believe that we've had an opportunity
[1:10:55] that others have not had because we can
[1:10:58] believe the word of Truth to be right
[1:11:00] amen not an interpretation of it an
[1:11:04] expressing of what God has done to bring
[1:11:07] you and I to a
[1:11:11] place that we must we must believe his
[1:11:14] word and what he
[1:11:16] said ain't talking about just his word I
[1:11:18] believe what Martin Luther
[1:11:20] taught he taught the just shall live by
[1:11:23] faith I believe that I believe John
[1:11:25] Wesley taught sanctification I believe
[1:11:28] that and I believe in
[1:11:30] it I believe the Pentecostals come with
[1:11:32] the restoration of the gifts I believe
[1:11:34] in
[1:11:36] that and I believe the Prophet come to
[1:11:39] bring us back to the word now listen not
[1:11:43] to bring a word but to bring us back to
[1:11:47] the
[1:11:49] word because the word was already there
[1:11:52] that's right y amen remember they said
[1:11:56] to brother
[1:11:57] brandom with your ability said you could
[1:12:00] write a 13th wasn't it 23rd chapter of
[1:12:06] Revelation they told him with his
[1:12:08] ability he could do that what did he say
[1:12:10] Oh Glory Hallelujah they think I'm
[1:12:11] something boy I'm something I've got
[1:12:13] this so much with God that I can
[1:12:15] write what did he say he said you can't
[1:12:19] do that because you can't add one word
[1:12:23] said if you add one word to this Bible
[1:12:25] God will add the plagues that are
[1:12:27] written in this book and if you take
[1:12:29] away one word from this book he said
[1:12:31] he'll take your name out of the book
[1:12:34] that's the Bible says that brother Ram
[1:12:36] never come to bring us some kind of a
[1:12:39] thing
[1:12:40] that we think has got to be
[1:12:46] interpreted when the Holy Spirit
[1:12:48] revealed to that Prophet to that white
[1:12:50] horse rider remember he thought the
[1:12:51] white horse rider was the Holy Ghost
[1:12:54] and taught the white horse rider was the
[1:12:57] Holy
[1:12:59] Ghost
[1:13:03] right but one day God showed him the
[1:13:09] truth that the one horse rider was the
[1:13:12] Antichrist he said I would have made a
[1:13:14] horrible
[1:13:16] mistake had the Holy Spirit not come in
[1:13:18] the room to straighten me
[1:13:22] out
[1:13:25] he was an honest
[1:13:27] man speaking of honest
[1:13:29] things and thinking about the
[1:13:33] truth we don't need nobody to interpret
[1:13:36] for us
[1:13:40] folks sure we need help we need somebody
[1:13:44] to explain
[1:13:46] it
[1:13:47] right somebody to study it out and find
[1:13:51] where the Prophet said this and the
[1:13:53] prophet said that that's
[1:13:56] right what do you need anything else to
[1:13:58] explain now there's so much Doctrine
[1:14:00] let's see let me hit one in a hurry uh
[1:14:03] so many doctrines about the New Birth
[1:14:05] I've been through that series part and
[1:14:07] in it you know one believes it's the
[1:14:08] Born Again One Believes a baptism One
[1:14:10] Believes it's this one believes it's
[1:14:14] that I asked brother brandham one day
[1:14:17] now I didn't see him and do it I was
[1:14:20] sitting
[1:14:22] praying and I said
[1:14:25] Lord that Prophet this way on
[1:14:29] back it's got to be the one to tell us
[1:14:32] and give us understanding about the New
[1:14:35] Birth so what is the new
[1:14:38] birth well you know
[1:14:41] what I didn't go to all of these other
[1:14:43] places to try to find out you know where
[1:14:45] I went I tyed it in or I didn't type it
[1:14:47] in then because as the old days before
[1:14:49] we had that but I just simply asked the
[1:14:52] question
[1:14:54] surely somewhere there's a definite
[1:14:56] answer to this
[1:14:57] thing one day I was reading Christ The
[1:15:00] Mystery of God reveal and there it was
[1:15:02] brother R said what is the new birth
[1:15:07] then
[1:15:08] okay now whatever you think it
[1:15:12] is whatever you got your idea idea
[1:15:15] that's your
[1:15:17] interpretation that's your
[1:15:20] conception right when you ask ask a man
[1:15:23] what it
[1:15:27] is he says what is the baptism of the
[1:15:31] Holy Ghost then brother
[1:15:33] random he said it's a revelation of
[1:15:36] Jesus Christ personally to
[1:15:41] you well you know what I ain't never had
[1:15:45] no problems with understanding the new
[1:15:48] birth I don't care how many explains all
[1:15:51] of their Concepts of ideas and things
[1:15:55] but if it don't come back to that
[1:15:57] statement then they are wrong and I
[1:16:02] don't mind telling them
[1:16:07] that I thought it was supposed to be
[1:16:09] that the prophet said that he'd be glad
[1:16:11] when we come to the basis that we would
[1:16:13] look people in the
[1:16:15] eye and say you're not saying what
[1:16:17] brother Bram said that's not th right
[1:16:20] the quote is what that you're not saying
[1:16:21] what Paul said right that's
[1:16:24] right but am I deep or
[1:16:28] this because that I've studied the
[1:16:30] message and got the answers from the
[1:16:32] prophet
[1:16:33] himself as he tried to not interpret
[1:16:36] that but explain it now
[1:16:41] watch the interpretation Was Made Real
[1:16:45] in his
[1:16:48] heart
[1:16:50] right with a man that live beyond beond
[1:16:53] reproach now there was some things he's
[1:16:55] human beings he wasn't perfect right but
[1:16:58] a man that lived a life as he did until
[1:17:00] no one not any of his uh there's never
[1:17:03] been anything written about him that was
[1:17:05] derogatory other than he was wrong on
[1:17:09] the
[1:17:10] word none of them would attacked his
[1:17:15] life you know how I know then he had the
[1:17:18] new
[1:17:20] birth because he told me what it was
[1:17:23] and that was what was in his
[1:17:27] life do you understand what I'm getting
[1:17:29] now one day a virgin said be it unto me
[1:17:33] according to Thy
[1:17:35] word let that be in my heart that's
[1:17:37] answer right and you know what it
[1:17:40] was you know what was her new
[1:17:43] birth not right then she didn't get the
[1:17:45] new birth right then right but what held
[1:17:47] her until she went to the upper room was
[1:17:49] that
[1:17:52] statement and that was 33 years
[1:17:58] later and her new birth was be it unto
[1:18:03] me because you believed
[1:18:07] it what is your new birth I shouted I
[1:18:11] cried I spoke in tongue I didn't ask you
[1:18:12] that that's right what is your new
[1:18:18] birth if we believe the new birth is a
[1:18:20] birth of the
[1:18:21] word
[1:18:23] then how can you have a new birth with
[1:18:25] all the false Concepts that I've done
[1:18:27] about it why not just relax folks and
[1:18:32] just read the word of God and listen to
[1:18:37] it I don't listen the tapes so run
[1:18:39] around them to find something secret oh
[1:18:42] oh did you hear that oo
[1:18:47] boy
[1:18:51] no you don't think
[1:18:54] it but I listen for one thing for him to
[1:18:58] show me
[1:19:00] Christ that's supposed to be in my
[1:19:04] heart and how that is to
[1:19:07] be within
[1:19:10] me I'm not looking for secret
[1:19:14] things The Greatest Secret of all is
[1:19:17] that God could save Mankind from his
[1:19:21] sins
[1:19:23] that God could bring us a word that
[1:19:25] doesn't need to be
[1:19:27] interpreted but needs to be
[1:19:34] believed if you can't understand
[1:19:36] something why don't you simply pray but
[1:19:38] listen now listen to the point before
[1:19:42] you
[1:19:43] pray well you ought to pray first you
[1:19:46] ain't listening before you
[1:19:49] pray why don't you look down in front of
[1:19:51] you at the letters on the page that
[1:19:54] Bible is telling you
[1:19:57] exactly the
[1:20:03] truth right why don't you read the book
[1:20:08] to see what's being
[1:20:10] said why don't you study brother Brown's
[1:20:13] message that way that's
[1:20:17] right I love to hear him explain his uh
[1:20:21] personal experience don't you
[1:20:25] amen of the things in his life in his
[1:20:29] personal
[1:20:31] experiences we were up at a certain
[1:20:32] brother I won't call his name cuz I'm
[1:20:34] trying to get away from putting names
[1:20:35] out cuz people don't like it but we were
[1:20:37] up at a certain brother's place one time
[1:20:40] and and he was showing us around in the
[1:20:43] area where he lived there were places
[1:20:45] that brother random had been and we went
[1:20:49] to the place where the old two old men
[1:20:51] sitting out under the old apple tree and
[1:20:53] we still got some apples in our
[1:20:55] refrigerator to house off that apple
[1:20:58] tree you know because it was momentos to
[1:21:01] me I've got rocks from over place in in
[1:21:04] Israel until the plane was like this
[1:21:06] flying back and brother George after me
[1:21:08] all the time about
[1:21:12] it but after a while that brother was
[1:21:14] riding along I said
[1:21:16] brother I said I'd like to hear your
[1:21:19] experience
[1:21:21] amen and I I you know i' like to see
[1:21:25] where you lived or things you've been
[1:21:28] through in your life you know what it
[1:21:31] shocked him I guess because people
[1:21:34] probably wouldn't ask him those things
[1:21:36] but he cared us around then and showed
[1:21:38] us
[1:21:43] places I'm interested in your
[1:21:47] experiences I love to get notes and I do
[1:21:50] from the people all the time explaining
[1:21:52] something
[1:21:56] I love to read what you have to say I
[1:21:59] like to read what's in your
[1:22:06] life now let me finish it by saying
[1:22:11] what how is it that I check a
[1:22:14] Doctrine how many of you remember
[1:22:17] that some of you heard me saying it for
[1:22:19] 40 years right you ought to remember it
[1:22:22] how is it that I check a Doctrine well I
[1:22:25] go into the Bible and the prophets
[1:22:26] message praise God I do too that's
[1:22:30] sensible but how do I really check a
[1:22:36] Doctrine by my own experience of Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ because anything else can
[1:22:47] be
[1:22:49] uh
[1:22:51] interpreted by
[1:22:58] Satan well I I look the person in the
[1:23:00] eye that's a good old Pentecostal you
[1:23:01] know I look him in the eye and I discern
[1:23:03] that spirit I never known but one way to
[1:23:06] discern a
[1:23:08] spirit I mean come on folks God gets out
[1:23:11] and shoot somebody he's a devil we don't
[1:23:13] have to have that interpreted do
[1:23:15] we but what are you talking about it's
[1:23:18] not to look somebody in the eye to see
[1:23:20] what kind of a demon it is check him by
[1:23:23] the word that's all you got to
[1:23:25] do it's just ask him about the
[1:23:30] word you know what he'll tell you a
[1:23:32] whole lot more than his eyeballs tells
[1:23:34] you cuz you can be deceived with all
[1:23:36] them
[1:23:38] things would you won't be deceived by
[1:23:41] the word of
[1:23:44] God so when somebody says brother Dale
[1:23:47] deep said brother Dale just explained
[1:23:48] the other day that he was the most
[1:23:50] simple man in the world
[1:23:54] I believe that that's not exalted stat
[1:23:57] that's a truth because everything that
[1:24:00] has ever been revealed to me has took me
[1:24:02] to my
[1:24:04] knees and say God you didn't owe me
[1:24:08] that you gave it to
[1:24:11] me you know yourself that I've come here
[1:24:14] many many many times and told you Lord
[1:24:16] met me yesterday to explain
[1:24:20] this you know what
[1:24:22] I didn't have it today
[1:24:30] before see we don't need an
[1:24:33] interpreter we have the one who wrote
[1:24:38] it
[1:24:40] right we need to somebody to explain
[1:24:43] things yes because that's part of our
[1:24:45] human life may I say it again you don't
[1:24:49] go down into a college and and learn
[1:24:52] learn how to interpret how to
[1:24:57] operate you learn by experience from
[1:25:00] somebody who can teach you how to do it
[1:25:03] that's
[1:25:04] right
[1:25:07] right so let's get away from that
[1:25:09] thought of it's we need an
[1:25:10] interpretation no we need God to
[1:25:16] reveal we need and thank God for those
[1:25:19] who try to help us by explaining it
[1:25:25] I like what brother Woodby said one time
[1:25:26] about it he said a little old wash woman
[1:25:28] it can't write her name don't know
[1:25:30] nothing so she can help you if she's got
[1:25:33] the Holy Ghost
[1:25:35] right right you know if they got the
[1:25:38] Holy Ghost they got something real
[1:25:40] that's right
[1:25:43] right come on
[1:25:44] musicians yall cutting up is number one
[1:25:47] there's
[1:25:49] a there something on my mind that try to
[1:25:52] get you to think
[1:25:57] rightly to let God reveal
[1:26:03] himself to you and
[1:26:05] I there's the opening of the
[1:26:09] word then could we be as Mary and say be
[1:26:12] it unto me according to Thy
[1:26:15] word that's it right
[1:26:18] there right that's my answer there is
[1:26:21] the interp
[1:26:24] ation what she said was made
[1:26:27] manifest into her body right
[1:26:30] then
[1:26:32] right let stand what we got brother
[1:26:37] 389
[1:26:44] 389
[1:26:46] when like a anybody have a
[1:26:51] need
[1:26:54] think about
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:26:57] it God just wants somebody to believe
[1:26:59] his
[1:27:05] word
[1:27:07] whatever my
[1:27:09] Lord th has
[1:27:12] taught me to
[1:27:14] say it is

[1:28:01] assur us
[1:28:07] control that Christ
[1:28:11] has for his wife Lord made a great
[1:28:15] statement before the confirming of your
[1:28:17] word and now just let your word go forth
[1:28:20] and touch our sister take away that
[1:28:22] hurting from her leg and knee and all
[1:28:24] Lord we believe it we thank you in Jesus

[1:29:59] let you speak to our hearts and our
[1:30:01] lives that you could bring us to the
[1:30:03] place that we could be what you want us
[1:30:06] to be Lord forgive our sins because we
