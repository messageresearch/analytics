when I come back from um when I come back from the far e in November and we had got word that the Ambassador uh to Ireland uh Zeon and they call it z z they don't say Zion like they call it Zeon Zeon he was he was the uh ambassador from Israel to Ireland and he was leaving to go back to Jerusalem and he wanted to see us before before he left so I had to go from the airport uh my wife picked us up and uh uh we drove right to the Embassy so I had to get my under my suit and stuff like that you know but we had a wonderful time there and I just said to the Ambassador before he left I said there's one thing I want to tell you Mr Ambassador and it's this that I do not believe in a trinity I do not believe there are three gods and one godhead I said I believe in the god the god of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that's right and he came up went back this a little bit of that and CU cuz he's a great friend of uh that fell in Texas my whatever you call him and he's poured in millions of dollars to to uh to Israel and he says well he says we never talk about that when going to let that one drop when he's talking to him but I just said I want I want you to to know that and uh the Ambassador I told him when he came up to Donny B I said never trust the Catholic Church never trust the Catholic church and I still say that today and uh so uh we give him some lovely little uh uh kind of uh pictures of of Don Ireland and he said to me he said um I I'll put these up in in our uh home in Jerusalem so that's where they're hanging today and he gave us a lovely plate of like kind of all these little squares with Jerusalem and and shapes and it I forget mosic that's what it is mosic beautiful we've got it up in our home as well so uh we found out later that he is to take up his new post and he's going to be what the isra ambassador to the Vatican I'm telling you that's I am telling you this is true you couldn't make it up if you you just couldn't make it up you know so uh really and truly you know we're so thankful and he C so calls as our friend as a matter of fact if I may just take a moment to tell you that um when I was talking to him I said um you know uh I had a dream of you and he said oh and I said yes sir I I said and in the dream a little bit like Stonewall Jackson in the dream I said we were kind of traveling we were moving and and we came to this place and I said uh Ambassador I said we can sit down here and rest look at that view it's beautiful so I told him that dream and I said sir I said one day I believe that we'll sit down in the kingdom of God together amen and we'll be a place where that's perfect right amen so you pray for him CU he's going to be a needy man and a lovely man and and we thank we thank the Lord to have his friendship he still ask S betters a lot uh so I I appreciate that uh last last year we left um I've left some photographs at the back there just there's a little table on the right before the pastor's office and uh you if if you wish to if you don't wish to it's quite okay but if you wish to you can look through some of the photographs of what I took obviously I took lot more but just just to give you a little uh idea of what happened last November and uh uh so we we went off to uh to India last November and I was pleased we baptized four four people and uh you you'll see that there's one of them and a little river and they actually it was so so dry there that they had to scoop out a hole in in the river bed so as we could get the little girl in but we got her in we baptized her a long walk and need a turban for me or a matal but it worked well too and uh we baptized the three people we came to the village and this need was read out it wasn't read out from me it was read out from Brother no because brother brother Danny uh living in the tager reserve he we baptized him about 5 years ago and now he's a pastor doing this work in that Village and now they've got $4,000 out of the out of the missionary convention to and that will be just a such a rich blessing to him amen and it was his mother his father I led to the Lord I baptized him and uh last year because she was sick the year before last year when we arrived November she wanted to be baptized and it was getting dark so remember this is a tiger Reserve there's no more roads very it's unbelievable just jungle ahead so there was this little path up to the well and the government they dig the wells for the people about 40t maybe in circumference maybe 25 ft deep 30 ft I don't know what depth they are uh to get down to the water level and so uh it was dark but they still wanted to be baptized so they led us down to this place and I they had torches and they shown it you'll see it it's pure dark it's black you you look at the photographs and uh so I I the first thing I said to myself there's nobody going to be baptized here tonight I look in this big hole you know they're not even steps how they going to get you done you know but within second some of the boys had scrambled down and the next thing they're holding up hands to me and so we got down and into the water and uh that they couldn't do for me I had to get into the water myself and find my fooding and I'm up about here in water and the more you go back the deeper it gets and so we baptized the first brother fine and then the little sister who had come to the Lord uh and had been si uh she was baptized but she she stiffened up when I just got her under the water and she stiffened up like a board and I I don't it was the best that I could do remember this is pitched dark the best I could do was get her up again so I managed to do that but it took such an effort that I went backwards right and spash right into the water and you know so I didn't mind and I scrambled out and one of the brothers grabbed a hold of me and weeded me out and then we baptized the last person they were fine so you have these you have these things you know and I remember one time similarly uh that we baptized some folks in a a big tank like that a big you know it's a great big Wells and uh there was a big commotion going on and I said what's what's happening up there and they said oh it's all right they just pulled a snake out of the water and away you can imagine how I felt you going into the water you know you know it doesn't have any brothers and sisters down there but you know yeah God's good and so it was wonderful amen amen and uh praise the Lord um uh there there is uh you'll see a photograph down there of a pastor you might know him he's standing there with his son but uh just goes to show you that missionary work is that uh when we arrived they were just down to the last of their race just down to the last of it amen and just dust that's all they had that's all they were eaing and and he didn't even he was so proud of a man very very proud people you know he wouldn't even mention it but we had brought him over two big sex of race about that s there amen and so to me that's what missionary work everybody's got their own thing to do amen some people we we built churches but I ain't going to build anymore but I tell you what uh everybody's got their own and I like to bring food to the people to the poor people they're all still in The Villages mostly not they're still uh quite poor so anyway uh I we so happy with that amen and we left him happy as you can well imagine uh at that time and his wife was in tears showing that to brother Freddy amen and uh let me see uh yes if if I may uh we we spoke to about 2,000 people last November in India so that was quite a lot of people to preach to 2,000 people and last year I remember telling you this is this is the sister here and this is the sister that was in the coma last year I told you that she had been raised out of that coma and uh I tell you one thing the day I looked at her and she was in that coma she didn't look like that right but this last November when I got there uh I didn't think I was going to meet her but her son brought her out and there she was amen and I thank God I really thank for is so good amen and I'll tell you what friends I I critics are critics so those be critics I couldn't care less am I saw that Hallelujah I saw that with my own eyes and I didn't do it Gary I did not do it it was God that did it amen and so we're thankful there's the little woman there and I want to show you this because couldn't have a child amen and uh and they asked us to pray and I knew why uh the medical conditions and all why they couldn't have a child but they ask us to pray and that's all you can do is pray amen now God has every right to say yes or no amen he can say whatever he he he's God and so the thing is that uh we prayed but the next day the Lord spoke to us as I read the book of Psalms and he said I have heard your prayer and when that came out when I was praying about that subject and that came out I knew that God had heard the prayer and so there she is in the family way and praise the Lord at they uh they contacted us brother Aaron they contacted us and they uh asked us to name the baby so I said well I believe it will be a boy but if it's a girl cuz I'm not going to be dogmatic I just believe it's going to be a boy and she was carrying quite high and all that and I I said you call it Steven so this January past uh baby Steven come into the world Amen seen that happen more more than once praise the Lord I've seen that happen more than once folks and amen let me just go on down fast amen uh let me see we just leave leave that off there amen and en tiand this year praise the lord it's it was beautiful because we have a Sunday morning service here and wouldn't it be lovely if someone has you brought someone this morning or a family member and you're really sitting there and you don't know the Lord and you can know the Lord amen and the the pastor son his wife didn't know the Lord and she come out and Reed Christ on the first Sunday of was enand this year so that's that's that's our business amen right that's the business of the church amen to reach out to everyone who will be reached out to you amen so that was a thrill and on the Wednesday night we had special services we we have these special services now every year and at the end we give them their little bags of rice and their oil and their noodles and whatnot and they like that they're poor people so I don't mind and that was wonderful and then there was three three uh four four young three young girls and one boy came to the Lord as well on the Wednesday night in Thailand amen so I'm glad people say have you ever been up to um uh uh uh Manar Burma I have and I baptized people up up in Burma as well I baptized people everywhere and you know and and so I just thank God for it folks it's wonderful and uh that was a wonderful time we baptized seven people in in Thailand so the church is doing well wish somebody would come along and start over to Ireland and start winning souls for us amen but that's the way God works you know and and he does the unusual uh thing in the unusual place and in an unusual way always on the unexpected way praise God and certainly that is the truth amen now um let me see here if I can just go on very very very fast here we went on down to Vietnam amen and uh we had the ministers meeting praise the Lord and I just want to mention this of a May if you just give me that few moments to do it folks uh there was one one little brother and he traveled a thousand kilm to be at the meetings a thousand now I don't mean in a nice air conditioned bus I mean probably some old thing I brought them down from the hills down to a city maybe the buses would get a little bit better and he put a big effort into coming he was so worried that he he wouldn't be able to get May back home again cuz you know he spent all his means and uh I really thought that was wonderful and then when he's not even Vietnamese because the Vietnamese many many hundreds of years ago maybe thousands pushed them all up into the hills so these are ethnic people that lived in that country even before the Vietnamese lived in it yeah and uh there he is and he's going around they got the we we couldn't I couldn't go up there and ey there been no way I could go up to that place because I would have to pass through the town and then go up that far the police would just arrest you in minutes you know just couldn't do it but he can do it amen and that's who you support the that can do it and so uh he was telling us that he was had been in prison from 1997 imagine so close five in prison for Jesus Christ and you know that our brothers and sisters are in prison over in Iran today right now as we for the gospel imagine right just because you believe in Jesus Christ in prison and that's a sh that's a sh for that to happen but it does happen Paul went into prison on mine but when he was in prison first of all he showed me on his photograph he showed me the the ball of fire right there up in the church imagine I never heard nothing about nothing yet the ball of fires right there in the middle of their Church P you know so so God is God and he knows his own elect I'll tell you that and um then he said that while he was in prison it must have been awful hard but uh sometimes I do believe that God will take you out of yourself just out of yourself the peeling your body might be such but he just take you out of yourself and he said he showed me the city he showed me the city man he had a a wonderful thing if God showed him the city that we're going to amen and and how much the Lord would think about that little man amen to give him such a a revelation and such a tour amen so it was it was truly truly wonderful and we had a wonderful time there I've got a little photograph if you look at the back of it there I've tried to read it in that in Vietnam there's a little meeting and that's just before the police came this year and uh we've had our little ups and downs with the police over there but you know God's always took us through amen and uh the police did come it was a you see you're not allowed to have midweek services in Vietnam if you're just uh not registered and all that there and the police asked brother n uh to register and to say that he would not let any more new people join the church and he just refused to sign the so I'm not signing that and I wouldn't sign it and so uh to this day you're not supposed to have Services during the week we're all the all the ministers meetings took part uh for the first what Saturday Sunday and Monday I think three nights and they were singing the you know if the police started came would all be them arrested you know but um that day and I would just got up to preach and uh The Interpreter told me the police have arrived imagine the police imagine if the police came this morning and said everybody get out you know rest brother Samuel and say uhuh you can't do that you know so so it's wonderful to have freedom amen and I'll tell you what so um uh the I sat down I just closed my Bible and sat down at the Bible a little just you see it's a little small place and uh they were they were in with the pastor and the big fell he was really mad he was really angry you know because he said to the pastor the The Interpreter told me he said to the pastor you never asked my permission you know and he was going on hard onto the pastor about the violations and all the rest of it and uh I think actually hard the police had arrived was because they saw a few Christians coming together because I wasn't there long enough for them to phone the police and say there's a white man there and I and come quickly I they were already on their way and and so uh yeah but the brother said to me the little brother said to me uh we can leave now we can go now and I thought oh that's good and I left I just walked right out past the place and walked out the door and one of the brothers who had just slipped out as well he came around with his motorbike and he handed me a helmet and he said put that on so I put it on he said get on so my little case uh my little case and my Bible was all closed and of course I will tell you this night that if I had been here behind the pet with the Bible open they would have ared me right on that alone they would have just took me right into custody and that would have been it but I'd closed the Bible and I sat down at the bik and when he said we could go I just got up and walked out so later on I asked the little fell this was later on in the night when we got back to saon I said tell me I said did Don big guy give you permission for us to go he said oh no he didn't and I said you mean to say I just got up and walked right out and they were so amazed or whatever they just let you up he said yeah he must have been well Jesus did that at it was wonderful amen praise God so so many got so many good things to say you know and of course I I will I will want to say this if you give me another few minutes that Creed up now but that is even for young people that's the flag of Leos Leos is a is is communist country too but they ain't half as bad as Vietnam Believe Me Right amen they ain't half as bad as Vietnam I wouldn't be as worried about uh even one of the brothers said to me if the police do come just tell them you know brother Moses it'll be all right so you may yes and yeah so I really you know uh I I don't think i' they're still on the job I know that but uh not as maybe not as much and uh we better not be too late or not in case they come back to us when we go back again but we we met we met this brother uh well we went into a r up in the middle of the country it was about 150 mi from the China border and right it was the old capital and we met some fine Christians there they've invited us back and we were able to share a lot with them so that was very good and then when we went back to the capital this brother he doesn't live in the capital but he drove down and uh he can speak well you can nearly say PS in English it was it seemed quite good to me but uh really when he sends the email you you know you got to see what he send but uh but he's in touch with us amen and we're in touch with him he wants us to come back and um really I challenge them on baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that will break the tith amen with any denomination amen if you think it won't yes you go up and tell your Baptist pastor oh Pastor the wonderful news I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said the wonderful news is you're at the door you know yeah so so that's it so anyway um do pray about Leos uh because I I was so impressed up there that I was thinking to come back this November but the folks in India are praying very hard that I won't that they'll come there so I I I I've been ready before I came uh the finances are in good shape as regard buying the next ticket and I must say folks God has been so good to us over the years been so good to us never lacked a thing you know never failed his unfilling Word of Promise There's No Lack amen it's wonderful and what a mighty God we serve this morning amen so you do pray for us and thank you thank you and as long as I've got the health and strength amen we're in the service of the Lord on the fireing line amen um when I come home from India I should tell you this as well uh when I come home from India the Lord had told me that the devil was going to get a punch at me in India and and I every day I was there I was watching to see brother deck where this punch is going to come from you know so we went through the whole country we flew up to Bombay with with brother Steven Cindy had wonderful meetings and uh and uh you know nothing happened so but I was always aware but the last night we were there all the preaching had my cases packed ready to leave India and something bit me three times in that room I don't know what it was but I knew when I I felt it on the jet when I got home I needed to go to the doctor because I was just at a B St so don't never think oh brother George over there God bless him that's wonderful just pray specific prayers amen pray that them things won't happen and and the devil and and may I say this folks and I mean this sincerely when I was there I felt that the devil had me in his mouth that's a fact but I'm going to tell you something what I also felt he couldn't close it so that's all right and I do appreciate your prayers more more than anything more than anything I appreciate your prayers so you remember us uh if you will amen now we certainly are thankful to be here brother Samuel thank you for having us once more and I'm sure God wants to speak to us this morning amen praise the Lord amen and I'm make be sure that when the people it's a Sunday morning amen we just want to be fed by the word of God is that right amen so if you would please turn to your Bible amen and I just put this out the way if I may praise the Lord amen and it's going to be in Corinthians we're going to read in Corinthians but we're going to go back into the Old Testament but we're going to read in the book of Corinthians chapter one uh very very well-known scripture but uh I believe that if you just sit there God will speak to you on this lovely subject so it's a Corinthians chapter 1 and and um First Corinthians that is not just to keep you right there and it's verse 17 we we can read from you know that Prophet said we should read the word of God at every service that's right every service for Christ sent me not to baptize now that's Paul's speaking certainly not me amen but to preach the gospel not with the wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ be made of none of fact am for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the predent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of the world hath not God made foolishness the wisdom of this world and if you want me to just say something here going to Mars is foolishness musl of the world Amen you're right there with me amen amen for after that the wisdom of God the World by wisdom you not God it please God by the foolishness of preaching to see them that believe in for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom another new thing you know you know you've read it in the ACT but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God so Christ is the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than man right and if ye see your calling Brethren hi that not many wise men after the flesh not many made uh might not many noble are called that's right but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are might y amen and the be things of the world and things which are despised have God chosen Y and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom right but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and Redemption that as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the Lord amen praise the Lord maybe we'll just at a moment uh we'll have a short prayer gracious Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for this Lord's day and you said Lord Jesus that we should honor the resurrection amen and the prophet told us that Lord by coming to church and so Lord here we are your s this morning to honor the resurrection of Jesus Christ and Lord we do pray now that you will come in our midst Lord oh God let your Holy Spirit re on us Lord this morning and touch our souls and bless your word Lord take mind out of it all together and be pleased to speak through these lips Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and you may be seated praise the Lord and I I I'll try and just finish off about 12 that's okay I'll about 160 minutes but the wisdom of God Amen and uh praise the Lord the wisdom of God um Jim said If any man lack wisdom let him ask God let him ask God that giveth to all men liberally so God is a liberal he didn't know that but he is he's a liberal Giver Hallelujah and praise the Lord I'm not say anything Lord Brother I know amen amen but that he giveth to all men liberally and breath not amen he doesn't have any distinctions praise God he doesn't care what what you are as long as you believe and it shall be given to him that wisdom shall be given to him but let him ask in faith amen let him ask in faith amen now uh some of you I'm sure you have your computer you have the message the table on it and you can see what y says about wisdom and all that wisdom Broad and full intelligence and of diverse manners and stuff like that and the wisdom of God and the Supreme intelligence of God that's that's all true every bit of it but if I could just bring it down we're we're a lot of us are country people and if I could just bring it down to this wisdom is the ability to use experience to use experience amen a understanding and knowledge in order to make sensible decisions amen sensible decisions and judgments and some people folks are not making sensible decisions even in the message standing up and saying things that they ought not to say see so amen and that's what wisdom is the ability to use that experience and understanding and knowledge in order to make sensible decisions and judgments amen and and and that's true now this this is where I suppose I wouldn't say it's Irish but we're going to go back to the Book of Proverbs amen so you you stand there in the Book of Proverbs with me this morning and this is a Sunday morning a Sunday morning morning service amen praise God and uh bless the Lord in the book in The Book of Proverbs we'll stand right there at the front we'll see hard God takes takes us through it amen The Book of Proverbs It's a Wonderful book I love reading the Book of Proverbs amen and the Book of Proverbs has been called God's guide for life's choices righten God's guide for life's choices amen surprising how many people don't seem to be able to ask the Lord what they should do amen they may ask this counselor or that person but but not the Lord and that's the very first person we should be going to Amen to ask him amen for his guidance Hallelujah the guidance of the Holy Spirit as we make life's choices amen praise God and that's so very very true amen amen it's been called The Book of wisdom and more correctly I would say the book of divine wisdom amen this is God's wisdom in here Hallelujah and we we'll look at it amen and he even says it to know wisdom uh verse uh one verse sorry chapter 1 verse 2 and verse 7 to know wisdom the fear the reverential fear of the Lord It's not a fear where you're caring in the corner waiting to be beat with a whip it's a reverential fear that you know he's a holy God Amen and so uh praise the Lord that is the beginning of knowledge that is the beginning of wisdom to have that fear of the Lord in uh in your heart amen and wisdom and knowledge of sisters they're just so born together amen and uh wisdom cries in the streets right verse 20 it's everywhere right it's everywhere I suppos it's like water but you don't have maybe so much water but uh it's everywhere but yet man rejected yet men rejected they reject the wisdom of God amen and praise Lord so he says in Chapter 2 incline your ear both your iner ear and your inner ear unto wisdom and apply your heart on the understanding and that's very good advice I like good advice I like s advice amen and it says seek it h a silver search for it as Head Treasure why because the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth right amen that's why in other words we want to hear what God says you know folks I would not believe it as someone says well God never Speaks now amen I wouldn't believe that because God speaks to us all the time Hallelujah all the time every day when we read his word he's speaking to your heart amen praise the Lord that he can come right on the scene when you need that and that's what it is he giveth wisdom out of his mouth which is his word amen and praise the Lord uh Jesus said in Revelation he said that I Cel you that thee that you buy of me gold tried in the fire here in both scriptures is knowledge and understanding amen sign wisdom for the righteous amen uh Ser wisdom for the righteous now and he who was made to be sin who knew no sin that we could uh be made the righteousness of God in him take that wisdom from him this morning now I'm just kind of building a little platform here me so amen uh understanding and judgment yes every good path Solomon says amen is is Pleasant you know God's ways are not hard God's not a slave driver he leads his sheep he he leads you he doesn't drive you hallelujah thank God and Sh G pastures he leads his dear children alone amen and that is so wonderful amen and here's a little thought for you just as we get get right into this here in a moment do uh don't be wise in your own eyes now that has actually came after chapter 3: 5 and 6 for short happen to be uh some of my most precious scriptures amen trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not onto your own understanding that's what's happening folks when you lean onto your own reason and your own understanding you weren't there you never seen it so you don't know amen and you can't lean on your own reason or understanding but in all your ways acknowledge Him and He will Direct your and he will do that but here he says don't be wise in your own eyes that speaks of Pride and Carol when someone thinks they know something amen but he said but reverence the Lord in your thinking and he says in verse 13 of that chapter chapter 3 he said a happy man is one who finds wisdom right from above amen there's so many you know so much wisdom in the world Amen they're going to tell you how to get rich they're going to tell you how to uh if you had an accident our

wounded duck he said that's me he said but I'm still here and I'm still good on he said but that dead duck is you brother BR said it is the wisdom of God to know how to accept Jesus Christ that's what he said amen so the Lord founded the Earth by wisdom in verse 19 amen and uh praise God it's so beautifully balanced I don't want to go into that but it is and the whole plan was planned in the wisdom of God and he he did it by his wisdom and it was his faith that knew the power that actually brought it in to being his means and hard to do it amen wisdom amen now if I may just get on done as quick

you're like uh uh Gideon you might need extra confidence but God will give you what you need amen whatever you need this morning that's the god that we're coming to amen and he says in chapter 3:35 he said the wise shall iner Glory the wise shall inherit Glory now why would that be because we're the bride because you know uh the designations all right people can see themselves in the Bible Well we

yourself amen that says I believe I'm going to amen hallelujah I know that I know that I know I'm going to be there on that day amen praise God and you know if you look at it like that uh the way shall inherit Glory I mean who was it that was sitting with Abraham as being the Seed of Abraham if we're in Christ who was it sitting in the tent when Elohim appeared amen praise God and who was it that rose up amen I I certainly I enjoyed preaching I took a long time ever to preach a a message on Sarah but I enjoyed preaching on Sarah because when to think about her whole life think that she was always just halfhearted maybe at the beginning but later on she was well no it's not going to happen yeah no it's not going to happen like that right amen y and and only when he appeared amen and said why did Sarah laugh he said for is there anything too hard and she standing there she's been exposed to her lack of faith and she's standing there and he said is there anything too hard for the Lord here and she was so taken by it that she got the Revelation she seen herself in the promised land it wasn't Abraham only it was her and she believed him Hallelujah and she had as it glory to God well it's wonderful amen bless l so the promised son our bridegroom will come to us amen with that shout that voice amen of the resurrection and not Trump of God to bring us into that Millennial Reign it's all happening amen so he says with all your getting amen you know uh it's it's so powerful you know with all you're getting we always want to get more you know it's a that's a kind of age it is

have a nice room somewhere it's all clovered up with stuff and and and that's it but get get wisdom forsake not wisdom for she shall preserve thee like salt you want to be preserved in an hour like this amen and and and love love her and she will keep the am now now we said earlier on wisdom is Christ sure have you got any mistakes that wisdom is Christ see you could you every every time it mentions the word wisdom you could translate it by just saying Christ Christ Christ you can say that amen nine and it will exalt if you exalt her she will promote thee amen she'll certainly do it being a crown of glory and grace now the wisdom I just want to take you along this line for a little moment when you look at Solomon Solomon says attend unto my wisdom and he says in chapter 5 basically he says avoid the lust of the flesh avoid the lust of the eyes and avoid the pride of life amen that's what he's saying here and that's what we ought to that's what we ought to amen uh we ought to have our breakers on because it's a terrible age am amen I tell you what friends it's it's it's a terrible age you know and people do not realize what spirits on them amen they do not realize you know what on them but here he says this and uh wisdom the the Solomon's wisdom amen uh you remember that story when the the two harlots and they had both children and one of them over slept the baby and so they were able to come into the presence of the king imagine the great Solomon yeah of all Israel Hallelujah sitting on his throne and and and so maybe the the the the the the the person there he's reading out and I sir n your majesty the king we have uh next on the L for your wisdom is two harlets yeah and there they're standing right there before the king of Israel right absolutely I tell you what well they can do it we will have an interview with Jesus Christ one day that what a day that will be when it's only you and him amen what a day that's going to be and they had a right to the king and they were there and they said well uh this is the story uh the D children and one of them's dead and neither both clear them the living one so Solomon he said well okay that's fine he said let's just do this 50/50 say just bring me over your sword and we'll cleave it in half yeah and you know one of that woman said that sounds like a good judgment to me why yeah I'll take half of the de maybe you take the other half then that means we all loser she never said that she said yeah we we'll go by that and the other woman said no no that that came from my wom no your majesty the king no don't do that just give her the baby and I'll be happy and he said fine he said now you just take the baby home amen so he knows who whose it was great wisdom hallelujah amen and and and look what you could go on more the the queen of uh Sheba coming to hear the wisdom of Solomon and he told her all things from a little girl what she did hallelujah what a time it would have been for her do you remember the time you were praying right say your your pond there at the palace and could tell her what she said and what she did and oh my she just back you know and brother bam said it they said in that era that any Israelites could say to a heathen could say well we know because we've got a king amen whose wisdom is such that you'll know God is Al life right that's right because he do that he'll tell you things that nobody else knows and yet of all we've had it in our generation folks a prophet who never missed it Hallelujah never right amen and told us the secrets of our heart and more than not amen and so we're so thankful for that tonight amen right and Jesus said a greater than Solomon is here and what does he do he takes a little baby and he sets it a little child sets it on his knee and he said except you become like that and have such Faith as a child you'll not enter the kingdom of God cuz a little child will believe it amen a little child will believe it amen and it's wonderful and Jesus Jesus said A wise man will build this house upon a rock right you know I don't know if I spoke I don't think so but back home we we spoke in a message uh lay up your treasure in heaven for where your treasure is that's where your heart will also be that's that's where you know where your Treasures what you C is precious Hallelujah that's where your heart will be right there and you can think about that this morning amen and so praise the Lord Jesus taught us the greatest of wisdom he said consider the Lily how it grows it toils not it doesn't rap and I say on you that solom man in all his glory was not a readed like that amen praise God never never did a man speak like that man because that Lily has a lward beauty that Solomon's outward Beauty never had and that's what you've got today you know you can pass your neighbor or some of your Workforce and they might say oh there's John or there's ath or whatever you know but they don't see the treasure that's in an earth and brother Jo they don't see the treasure they may look at that right word you know but they don't see the treasure that we're we're carrying today amen and that's wonderful the beauty of the L amen and uh you know we love these things and Jesus said one day the the the the the the best Ms that the Pharisees could produce yeah and they thought they had him trou and they said uh should we give tribute to Caesar now that is a just a real TR trick question that's the greatest Minds come up with that and they thought they had him what can he say because of he said yes then the Pharisees will go down and say you're a traitor you're not an Israelite you see yeah so what's he going to say if you say no then they're going to say you're not Caesar's friend and they got him they have got him Hallelujah that's what they thought but they didn't realize the wisdom that was standing before them and Jesus turned around and what did he say show me a pen right that's wisdom folks right well yeah we've got a penny what what about it he said you give to God what's God and you give to pH give to Caesar Pharaoh give to Caesar what Caesar and Caesar had no right to that land so they walked away absolutely marveling at the words and as one of the captains of the Guard came back and and said no man speaks like this man amen there was a time and I I I certainly George wishart was a one of them Scottish divines he paid the ultimate price with his life amen for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the day he was being burned in the State uh the great Archbishop of the Catholic Church says you
