[13:20] reading so far by grace are you saved
[13:23] through faith that not of yourselves it
[13:28] is the gift of God now let's go over to
[13:34] Matthew 12:43
[13:38] when the unclean spirit is going out of
[13:41] a man he walketh through Dry places
[13:43] seeking rest and find us none then he
[13:47] said I will return to my house remember
[13:50] that now last Sunday we were talking
[13:51] about it or Wednesday I'll return to my
[13:54] house you know all right from Wis I came
[13:59] out and when he has come he findeth it
[14:02] empty swept and garnished now look at
[14:05] them it's a clean houses everything's in
[14:08] order
[14:08] then goeth he and taketh with him seven
[14:11] other spirits more wicked than himself
[14:14] and they enter in and dwell there and
[14:18] the life state of that man is worse than
[14:20] the first even so shall it be also this
[14:23] is a wicked
[14:26] generation you may be seated the Lord
[14:28] that is with blessings to the word Amen
[14:32] now I was thinking about something
[14:37] yesterday and reading a little bit time
[14:40] of studying in things and thinking about
[14:44] what the Prophet said you remember he
[14:47] was telling about the preacher that that
[14:50] come in and started preaching and he
[14:53] just kept preaching on sin repentance
[14:56] sin you know kept preaching on that and
[14:59] so they finally told him you know we're
[15:01] asked him said we've enjoyed it and
[15:02] always said you know when you're gonna
[15:04] get all the he said when everybody
[15:06] repents well I'll get off the new birth
[15:09] when everybody gets the new birth
[15:12] and that's that's the way that I am I'm
[15:16] sorry if you don't like my ways and
[15:18] think I just I don't like them either
[15:21] when I tried to abide in God's Word and
[15:24] we just keep on keep on until we see God
[15:28] move on the scene in all things okay now
[15:34] we've been talking about salvation been
[15:39] talking about salvation in stages or
[15:44] steps you know our manifestations or
[15:48] whatever you want to call it and the
[15:50] Prophet said there's three steps to
[15:52] grace all right and they asked him the
[15:56] question on the questions and answers
[15:58] was it necessary that everybody how
[16:01] those three stages he says yes he said
[16:06] to be borned again you must have the
[16:09] three stages all right if you get
[16:11] offended let me keep on going and over
[16:13] and over I simply asked you a question
[16:16] we're talking about in stages have you
[16:19] been through stage one of the new birth
[16:25] well I'm trying to get it to a point and
[16:28] trying to make it as simple as I can for
[16:31] you to understand see if you would take
[16:34] what I'm saying and listen to it instead
[16:38] of trying to figure
[16:39] Wow and I don't like this not like that
[16:42] he could be doing this it was a you know
[16:44] if you just listen to what I've been
[16:47] trying to say you might find out that
[16:50] you know for certain that you've been
[16:53] through stage one of the new birth I'm
[16:58] not trying to diss discredit anybody or
[17:00] throw anybody out or anything I've been
[17:02] trying to tell you what takes place at
[17:05] these stages all right
[17:08] Stage one is what justification chopping
[17:12] off your pie sins well you know the day
[17:16] that you went to the altar you asked God
[17:19] to forgive you you accepted him as your
[17:22] Savior you know then you're talking
[17:26] about justification all right
[17:30] then that's not a hard thing to follow
[17:33] it's not something to degrade you it's
[17:35] something to lift you up and let you
[17:37] know what I told you I said now we've
[17:39] asked in the question over and over on
[17:42] stage one justification have you
[17:46] experienced an actual part of your birth
[17:53] in the new birth that we would call
[17:56] stage one justification have you
[17:59] experienced that
[18:00] that's all I've asked it you know I've
[18:03] asked you have you you had an experience
[18:06] because I believe you must have an
[18:09] experience well I got it all at one time
[18:11] well I'm not arguing with nobody I
[18:16] believe that can take place I've
[18:18] preached that to you but the Prophet
[18:20] said very few people would believe all
[18:23] the way to receiving the baptism when
[18:25] the old ago
[18:26] he didn't say where did it be at one
[18:27] place or ten places he just said very
[18:29] few people would believe all the way to
[18:32] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:34] well now I try my best to get you to
[18:40] understand without like I said without
[18:42] Turing you down to her ass in well he
[18:45] don't believe I've got anything you
[18:47] don't brother Dale don't believe out and
[18:49] he don't believe I've got it if that's
[18:51] not for me
[18:53] that's between you and God that has
[18:56] nothing to do between you and your wife
[18:58] or your husband or your neighbor you
[19:01] past her hood it is between you and God
[19:04] you've got to settle this between you
[19:06] and him not try to bring anybody else in
[19:10] well brother so-and-so told me I've I've
[19:12] told you before about it when we came to
[19:16] the altar one time it was three of us I
[19:20] remember praying for the baptism when
[19:22] the Holy Ghost
[19:23] well this one brother they don't call
[19:25] his name but after it was done he said I
[19:27] believe all three of you got the baptism
[19:30] of the Holy Ghost right to her denial
[19:32] well both of those brothers years later
[19:35] told me that their experience was that
[19:38] that brother told them that he had was
[19:40] that they he believed they had received
[19:42] the old ago well you know what he prayed
[19:44] the same prayer over me but I didn't
[19:46] believe it because I'm like that little
[19:49] boy and said nothing happened well I'm
[19:52] not gonna tell something that did happen
[19:54] but see was there experience based upon
[19:57] what somebody else said are up on what
[20:01] they were having to say what is your
[20:04] experience all right now is we're going
[20:09] to go over into stage two in parts of
[20:13] what we're talking about today
[20:14] then remember we're going to ask that
[20:16] same question
[20:18] have you experienced sanctification have
[20:25] you had an experience in your life of an
[20:28] actual work or what everyone call it
[20:30] stage or whatever of sanctification to
[20:34] be in cleanse and set aside for service
[20:37] because you can't bypass any of it and
[20:40] come out to say you got the baptism with
[20:42] all to go he's right I just brother Dale
[20:45] I just I've never been taught nothing
[20:47] else and I didn't know you know now all
[20:52] right but listening to the prophets
[20:56] message you ought to know listening to
[20:57] him because he's I've asked you to read
[21:01] the future home and just to study the
[21:04] message
[21:05] he was explaining the new birth but I
[21:12] also know the story that went with that
[21:14] some of you do
[21:15] are you hurt it that brother said that
[21:18] they brought around him ask him did he
[21:19] understand the Futurama he said first
[21:23] said yes then he said do you under he
[21:25] said no and understand well see the
[21:28] Prophet says in the message the future
[21:31] home he said if you don't get nothing
[21:32] out of this get the new birth why he was
[21:38] explaining the new borough now he says
[21:43] don't Christ Christ in history what is
[21:45] the new birth he said it's a revelation
[21:47] of Jesus Christ personally to you
[21:49] revealing himself to you all right when
[21:52] he gets to the future home what does he
[21:53] do he breaks down the stages of the new
[21:58] birth well if you've never had these
[22:01] stages is it me that's saying that it's
[22:06] wrong
[22:06] if I say if you never had an experience
[22:09] then you don't know what it is so you
[22:11] needed experience well I just believed
[22:17] in everything well that's all right but
[22:22] are you putting your whole life on
[22:23] something you believe or something
[22:25] somebody told you would I have brother
[22:31] della I've got the new birth and I can't
[22:34] doubt it whatsoever
[22:35] it is never done better Brenham told you
[22:38] it is daughter-in-law Louis receive the
[22:43] Holy Ghost one night and the next night
[22:45] she's down yeah that's what I say I hate
[22:52] to say things to people when I know that
[22:55] your mind is set on certain things and
[22:58] you won't accept that and believe it but
[23:01] if I tell you that then don't worry
[23:03] about it when we get to judgment and you
[23:05] say white throne no I don't intend to go
[23:07] to white throne may be sitting on the
[23:09] white throne but I don't intend for me
[23:10] and you that's what I'm trying to do now
[23:12] is keep us away from the white throne
[23:14] I'm trying to get us born again is that
[23:17] all right trying to get us truly born
[23:20] again till we know because see the new
[23:23] birth your starts it I mean once we get
[23:27] to the new birth we've got to go through
[23:29] the adoption all stages we've got to go
[23:31] through all of the journeys of a
[23:33] Christian we got a long ways to go but
[23:37] you're talking about the new birth and
[23:40] how simple it is to understand all right
[23:44] now we read these so let's put it back
[23:46] up I want to keep these before you
[23:48] because you know at least you'll
[23:51] understand the Prophet is the one that
[23:53] said it go ahead with number one because
[23:57] we're talking about the new birth in
[24:00] stages you know being born again which
[24:09] deals with you getting born again it
[24:12] deals with you after you're born to him
[24:14] see it never stops so the new birth will
[24:19] never stop uh-huh no one's from the
[24:23] future home he says now the first step
[24:25] is repentance towards God then follows
[24:29] after that is water baptism what a
[24:31] baptism repent be baptized the name of
[24:33] Jesus Christ water baptism followers
[24:35] showing that your repentance was genuine
[24:38] are to remit our PI sins than once that
[24:42] has nothing to do with future sin yes
[24:50] you could be justified truly it has
[24:54] nothing to do with the future
[24:57] it's repentance of your sins so all
[25:00] you've done at justification it's
[25:04] chopped off your PI since that's what
[25:07] he's saying there's nothing to do with
[25:11] your future sin it only remit repent be
[25:14] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[25:16] remission taking away of Pi sins has
[25:21] nothing to do with the future
[25:29] the what just your sins has been chopped
[25:35] off what you did you don't repent for
[25:38] Adam and things like that look the old
[25:40] nature is still dire now I didn't say
[25:46] that do you say what brother Dale my old
[25:52] nature went out when I repented well
[25:57] then you're talking to the Prophet not
[25:59] to me you can get upset with me you know
[26:02] you think you can do that but just
[26:04] remember if I tell you what he said and
[26:07] you get upset with me for saying what he
[26:10] said that's the same as getting upset
[26:12] with him because he's won said it okay
[26:16] or if not let's stir up the message go
[26:19] home eat drink and be merry because
[26:21] tomorrow we die and we prove we don't
[26:24] have a new birth
[26:27] there are life that we're living is
[26:30] proof of the birth so then we went
[26:36] through trying to cover their Wednesday
[26:39] night justification
[26:42] chops off your pie sins has nothing to
[26:46] do with the future it only reveals the
[26:50] past we don't believe in the Catholic
[26:54] doctrine of that big old word further
[26:57] that you can go in and pay somebody to
[27:00] you know remix your sins before they
[27:02] ever sin we don't believe in that that
[27:06] won't work so it's only for the pice
[27:07] sins all right yeah it does nothing he
[27:14] said to your nature okay so we draw it
[27:20] out and took a little drawing of trying
[27:22] to help you to understand so go ahead
[27:24] brothers and well look we'll leave it on
[27:29] paragraph 89 reined up lady now
[27:37] one more okay
[27:40] he took a board he draw it out too harsh
[27:46] and he said now this is a human heart
[27:48] and this is the mtar okay he says here's
[27:52] a human heart here's a human heart
[27:54] this one over here has a snake in it
[27:58] that's in here he has his life this one
[28:04] over here has a dove in it which is all
[28:07] this period here he has a life so now
[28:11] you have a lot your life is what you are
[28:16] your life is your soul of your being
[28:20] right no that's why we're gonna get to
[28:25] it in just a minute with the anointed
[28:26] ones so hold on to your point your life
[28:30] is your soul no it's a life I live and
[28:35] that life ought to be lived by the soul
[28:37] which ought to be by Christ all right so
[28:42] now think about what he's saying well
[28:47] it's the one here has malice Envy that's
[28:51] what's causing it this fella here well
[28:54] fellas call isn't it the snake that
[29:00] we'll get to in a second yes but I don't
[29:03] like that because you you keep bringing
[29:05] it out there that we've born with a
[29:07] snake you're gonna talk to the Prophet
[29:13] go talk to him
[29:15] he said that's it the Bible says it that
[29:21] that unclean spirit is their brother
[29:24] branham calls it the unclean spirit he
[29:27] called it the root of evil but it
[29:30] actually no scripture that says a root
[29:31] of evil goes out whatever
[29:33] yeah there's it does about the root of
[29:36] of the fact of you lusting after this or
[29:38] listen but it not it doesn't use that
[29:40] terminology then they look this one over
[29:44] here at Lovejoy longsuffering that's
[29:48] what does it down here what causes
[29:50] from the inside right it's easy to see
[29:56] the dove is inside but the only question
[30:00] I got to ask you how did the dog get
[30:04] inside is that simple enough how did it
[30:11] get inside
[30:12] well I'd born with it I'd born this seed
[30:15] I'd want eternal life see the Bible says
[30:26] was born in sin save it in iniquity
[30:29] spouse my mother's wound and go forth a
[30:32] ladder okay no look he said when your
[30:39] ass you're forgiven of your sins you
[30:44] only done this now that's justification
[30:46] right you've asked you repented of your
[30:48] sins taken that away
[30:50] now watch but the thing that made you do
[30:53] it is still hurt taken what away takes
[30:58] away the sin of the soul salvation is
[31:03] not in your body salvation is not in
[31:08] your spirit the moon we're gonna get an
[31:14] anointing ones in a minute so the I hope
[31:16] you follow that salvation is in the soul
[31:20] of mankind your body displays what's
[31:26] your spirit is your spirit displays what
[31:29] your soul is right okay so you're not
[31:35] born again in your body you're not more
[31:38] to get in your spirit you're born again
[31:40] in your soul now that's the soul he's
[31:43] describing when he draws a heart right
[31:48] because the Bible talks about the heart
[31:51] what is the probably Toma
[31:52] the soul of an individual the heart so
[31:56] what's now then when you ask your
[32:00] repented or you're forgiven your sins
[32:03] you only did this taken that away now
[32:07] we'll show that on the drawing you take
[32:09] out the sin why but the thing that made
[32:13] you do it is still there that's the old
[32:15] root of evil it's still dark but brother
[32:19] Dale I remember when I went to the altar
[32:24] and asked God to forgive me and I felt
[32:27] this load come off of me
[32:29] Amy and I believe in that that's what I
[32:32] said you might find out you're further
[32:34] up the road then what you think I'm
[32:36] trying to make you you think I'm trying
[32:39] to degrade you pull you down to some
[32:41] Lowe's case I'm trying to tell you right
[32:45] where we're staying and what we're
[32:51] standing on that was you repent and are
[32:54] baptized the name of Jesus Christ for
[32:57] your sins okay
[32:58] no look no sanctification cleanse and
[33:01] said it's not but now go ahead now let's
[33:04] go with her drawing okay
[33:08] whoever number three brother now the
[33:13] profit draw to heart okay
[33:16] he said well he didn't draw it like you
[33:20] didn't draw a snake like that either
[33:27] but the soul of an individual code we're
[33:29] all born in sin according to Roman's 3
[33:33] I mean 3:23 we're born in sin so when we
[33:39] get that settled that we're all were
[33:41] born kinfolks to the devil because even
[33:47] the book of ruth declares out that there
[33:49] was one more kinfolks to us than jesus
[33:52] christ all right see then we were born
[33:56] in sin you say yeah but what about all
[33:58] this see don't I just see to see didn't
[34:00] me always was eternal well if you always
[34:06] was eternal you don't need eternal life
[34:08] may I ask you the question why did Jesus
[34:11] have to die why did Jesus have to die he
[34:15] always was eternal
[34:19] you see that's what tears it up that's
[34:21] what people don't like is because our
[34:24] stations say stuff like that instead of
[34:26] patting you on the back because he ain't
[34:28] trying to get your billfold I'm trying
[34:35] to get down where we all leave her all
[34:37] the soul those David Clyde out in his
[34:43] soul right trying to get us to see
[34:49] what's going on what did the Prophet say
[34:51] he draw the drawing he said no this and
[34:54] though here's got a snake in it he said
[34:58] in here he puts in in it he's he drawed
[35:05] it out to show you how that you're born
[35:08] in sin all right now what happens at
[35:13] justification go to the next one now
[35:20] number four but I remember that remember
[35:23] the pointer back over here this one that
[35:25] sin remember what he said over here
[35:27] these were the things in here and
[35:29] remember what he said the sin is what
[35:32] goes out at justification he said what's
[35:35] causing you you're still tired now here
[35:39] we go we try to put a faith in here to
[35:42] replace sin that's just happened that's
[35:46] men brother Joe trying to help you to
[35:50] understand cause brother Joe come up
[35:52] with a point of putting it into faith
[35:53] all right that's not faith it's faith
[35:57] trying to hold the place of where Satan
[36:01] had been cast out know that see him
[36:06] because it's gone out by the blood of
[36:09] Jesus Christ right justification is
[36:13] based upon the blood of Jesus Christ the
[36:15] forgiving us in i but he said the thing
[36:18] that made you do it is still dark
[36:24] I've always just been told all I had to
[36:26] do is was accept Jesus Christ as my
[36:28] savior then you want to take the future
[36:41] home book and tear it up throw it away
[36:45] because the problem is gonna be is we're
[36:47] gonna get more books and then we're
[36:49] going to tell you that nothing throw it
[36:51] away then we go get more books with my
[36:52] entire first thing you know England how
[36:54] new books
[36:55] I thought we believe the Prophet I don't
[37:03] care what you think I hope you don't
[37:07] care what I think it's what that prophet
[37:11] had to say cuz the Prophet told us what
[37:14] the Bible say the Bible says all born in
[37:21] sin house in a mother's womb a liar lost
[37:26] doomed and on the way to hell yeah but
[37:30] I've got where the Prophet said that's
[37:32] what I mean so you're gonna fight with
[37:34] me over quotes lingo finally I've been
[37:39] through all of that I know what you
[37:42] probably said he said if you have
[37:45] eternal life you always was eternal now
[37:49] where's your body eternal you ain't got
[37:53] there yet was you stole a spirit eternal
[37:57] the five senses of the second part
[37:59] reason no because that's still in sin
[38:04] there's only one place that God is
[38:06] dealing and that's the soul of mankind
[38:11] so you're not born again nowheres else
[38:14] than that
[38:14] let's see you repent of your sins you
[38:19] get rid of your sin you start trying to
[38:21] live right you remember that you
[38:24] remember when you first repented you
[38:26] went to the altar you cried out you
[38:29] asked God to forgive you that's
[38:30] wonderful that's part of God's Word see
[38:36] if we didn't
[38:36] oh this mystery but the snake was still
[38:43] there all right we didn't know that we
[38:51] wasn't taught that the churches didn't
[38:54] teach us about the snake being loved
[38:56] they know anything about it didn't know
[38:59] hat one out or what happened to it
[39:05] they'll move it on up this gets itchy
[39:10] Savoy scratch we're in the message have
[39:16] you ever heard much talk about
[39:17] justification sanctification the baptism
[39:21] of the holy ghost
[39:23] number two were have you ever heard that
[39:26] the Prophet said it is required that you
[39:31] go through these stages I'm asking you
[39:38] seriously
[39:39] you ever heard evil oh yeah we preach
[39:41] don't just yell but yeah we believe
[39:42] justification we believe you just gave
[39:44] chops off a sin we believe it within
[39:47] what happens you see you said well you
[39:55] ain't no to your business I'm the pastor
[39:59] that makes it my business if you don't
[40:03] like the faster you go get you another
[40:07] one and fool with his business because
[40:10] the pastor is supposed to tell us what
[40:14] the Prophet said and if he don't give
[40:18] you another one is that simple enough or
[40:27] go somewheres ours that's nobody's tried
[40:29] to make no Lula eyes out of this thing
[40:33] we've got enough problems as it is
[40:34] with our human selves we see your
[40:39] prophet said even though sin had went
[40:42] out of your soul now this is the one
[40:45] saying get it he's not talking about sin
[40:49] going out of your body
[40:52] your body came sin without your spirit
[40:58] and your spirit is motivated by the soul
[41:01] that's within you right so salvation is
[41:09] not in the body and spirit
[41:11] I saw you hearing the message now it's
[41:15] got away from advice twenty years kind
[41:17] of but you know what I'm talking about
[41:18] you that was our back by thirty forty
[41:21] years
[41:21] oh you had man say at one certain
[41:24] brother I don't do TOMS shoes when
[41:28] somebody preached against two songs you
[41:30] yeah that's a wonderful ended these
[41:37] people come in from this one church and
[41:38] his brother had always preached and it
[41:41] always preached and he preached about
[41:43] these tent dresses but always against
[41:46] this this no he preached their heart and
[41:49] I I'm dumb enough this but I'm still
[41:52] like ask questions I asked my wife I
[41:54] said what is the tent dress but I don't
[41:58] know what they are
[41:59] do you can you tell me what they are she
[42:02] said yeah they're kind of like a thing
[42:04] that gathers up into here seem describe
[42:06] the rest of if I miss it let's forget it
[42:07] something about that and it will goes
[42:09] down this way you know in spreads out
[42:12] it's like a pen I guess well I said well
[42:16] honey I said uh would you show me one
[42:22] thing to get dresses where I could see
[42:25] she said yeah says runner without of the
[42:27] offer you know who she's pointing out
[42:33] the sisters that had come with that
[42:35] brother that priest against the tent
[42:37] dresses well why didn't he preach it in
[42:39] his own church was it okay for him to
[42:43] move the Trant dresses over here
[42:45] come on you think I'm silly well I'm not
[42:50] things that had happened down through
[42:53] time that some of you are old enough to
[42:55] remember the what it was told is your
[43:00] wife worthy of the gospel
[43:05] you know that's a direct quote out of
[43:08] the message is your life worthy the
[43:09] gospel is that right well read it is
[43:14] your life worth it oh gosh let's see
[43:17] that's well that's what I'd say we get
[43:19] two women straightened out we'd be ready
[43:20] to go well I didn't okay
[43:25] no but listen take out sin try to keep
[43:31] it out by faith you know the word being
[43:35] revealed to you try to keep it out of
[43:38] there by faith coz you're placing
[43:40] everything gonna fight but the thing
[43:42] that makes you do it is still dark now
[43:43] how you gonna get that out of there
[43:49] how are you gonna get that out because
[43:57] the Bible says the unclean spirit is
[44:00] going out of man walking
[44:01] he said I'll go back now did you notice
[44:04] I read it Sunday our Wednesday already
[44:06] this minute ago he said I'll go back to
[44:08] my house that's in the Book of Luke -
[44:12] well it's Matthew I'll go back to my
[44:16] house whose house is he talking about
[44:21] where's the house he's talking about
[44:30] right here
[44:36] Satan's house our domain is what we were
[44:39] born into I don't care if you the
[44:44] prophets son I wouldn't care to say that
[44:46] to brother Branham or say it to brother
[44:49] around
[44:50] I'm not do grading nobody brother
[44:53] Branham is the one that said if that
[44:55] demon hadn't been married 12 years old
[44:57] he got born again earlier now he's the
[45:00] one that said you know you think I'm
[45:03] against the insert out of the other you
[45:04] ought to be careful I'm very careful
[45:06] what I say because I'm going to answer
[45:11] but I know twos I'm allowed to answer
[45:14] for your soul so you ain't gonna stand
[45:18] there white throne or the judgment of
[45:21] Deeds in the done in the body of the D
[45:24] we have a judgment we got two places one
[45:28] of them is deciding to whether to go
[45:30] into eternal life the other one is not
[45:32] that the other ones are rewards a
[45:34] different thing you got two judgments
[45:36] all right we're gonna stand down and
[45:40] we're gonna give an account well what's
[45:47] it gonna be with the poro preachers it's
[45:49] not told the truth what's it gonna be
[45:55] all right
[45:58] what you see now let me describe this as
[46:02] a second point just a thought now you
[46:06] remember when you repented of your sins
[46:10] we're back up to that other draw one
[46:12] that has sinned then all right there you
[46:15] go
[46:15] they got this sin is what went out at
[46:22] justification when we repented
[46:25] now you can't put eternal life in there
[46:29] now come on folks
[46:31] wake up you can't put eternal life with
[46:35] this old boy in the middle that unclean
[46:38] spirits in there there's not eternal
[46:40] life there come on let's see this sin
[46:47] goes out but it does nothing to
[46:50] nature now how do you get beyond clean
[46:59] spirit out
[47:07] there's not but one way to handle
[47:09] anything in Christ and that's through
[47:12] faith in his word sanctification is the
[47:18] compound word cleanse and set aside all
[47:24] right now the unclean spirit goes out
[47:28] that's sanctification are the root of
[47:32] evil will go out at sanctification week
[47:35] I'll show the next one will show now go
[47:37] to the next one see that's what you wind
[47:41] up with even if you can get the sin out
[47:47] even if you can get the snake out the
[47:50] root of evil what have you got
[47:57] you're a perfect target for the devil to
[48:00] come back that's what the scripture says
[48:06] and it's seven times worse now may I
[48:09] quote the Prophet what Brian what was
[48:11] those demons come back with basically
[48:14] religious demons right may I say it
[48:21] preachers because the Bible says that
[48:25] Satan has ministers and they're as
[48:30] ministers of righteousness that's the
[48:34] devil's preachers so it's not trying to
[48:45] get you to come back to the alternate
[48:46] would you come to the altar and you
[48:48] repent alright you start you do pretty
[48:54] good for a little while and the first
[48:58] thing you know things starts easing back
[49:00] in you you don't remember being that I
[49:07] lift my life I don't I don't know what
[49:11] you gonna do with it but
[49:16] that sin can be chopped off but what
[49:20] caused you to do it
[49:25] that snake sure he's out of there he's
[49:30] clean all is wonderful yes
[49:36] what a marvelous place to stay is to say
[49:41] to say a place that you could say it's
[49:43] clean you could say I've repented to God
[49:47] I've asked him to forgive me and he has
[49:50] forgiven me now I'm asking you again the
[49:53] question have you ever asked God to
[49:55] sanctify you well I didn't know I needed
[50:01] to you do now let's title this message
[50:05] you do now all right because you hearing
[50:14] it well I don't believe it cause you
[50:16] saying it well that's all right you
[50:18] gonna talk to God about 10 things I
[50:20] don't have to worry about it I'm just
[50:21] trying to tell you what the word says
[50:23] will solve the whole problems are you go
[50:25] ahead and do what you want to but look
[50:28] what a beautiful place to be is to be
[50:32] wonderfully clean to be to the point
[50:39] that sin cannot rule you you know
[50:48] yourself the Prophet and what he say it
[50:50] the do you sin he said every day so he's
[50:52] not talking about none sinners this is
[50:54] not none sinners oh you know no it's not
[51:01] nonsense
[51:01] it's clean sinners the centers that have
[51:06] been cleansed of their sin called
[51:09] sanctification is a cleanse and setting
[51:11] aside
[51:17] because that's where the unclean spirit
[51:19] goes out at its sanctification now the
[51:24] new burqa I don't know don't put that
[51:27] new birth
[51:28] hold on now do we get the message in a
[51:31] minute all right when you back up to see
[51:34] that that you you've got rid of sin but
[51:37] you still got the snake now you got rid
[51:40] of the snake okay we're a wonderful
[51:41] shape we're doing good but just remember
[51:47] you ain't got to dove the Dove ain't in
[51:53] there whatever the doves what throating
[51:58] on the dogwood wardrobe snake how
[52:02] there's were the problems that that's
[52:04] what you think it is you think the holy
[52:06] ghost come in and robots a snake you're
[52:09] too far ahead you gotta wait to get to
[52:12] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[52:15] fire will clean out anything that's left
[52:18] but here's where we're at
[52:20] now listen you're standing there
[52:24] perfectly clean sanctified
[52:40] what kind of nature have you got you may
[52:47] have gotten rid of the snake as the
[52:49] nature part but what kind of a nature
[52:51] part do we all have come along brother
[52:55] there loves to preach when you get quiet
[52:57] because even your sleep or your
[53:00] listening listen if you could think for
[53:05] a minute about these kids you realize
[53:11] that kid when it's born is not born with
[53:15] a snake come on he's not born with all
[53:23] these demons in it you know where the
[53:26] demons come from Mama and Daddy oh you
[53:32] don't like that one living all do you I
[53:35] raised my kids best I could I didn't I'm
[53:43] saying you didn't we just tried our best
[53:50] to do the best we could maybe that's the
[53:52] better way of saying it we tried but I'm
[53:57] asking you here's a little baby to
[54:01] describe it that way that unclean
[54:08] spirits got out that motivator is gone
[54:12] out of you but once motivating you from
[54:20] the stage of sanctification to the stage
[54:26] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[54:28] realize that's just doing the best it
[54:32] can to describe it and the best way I
[54:34] can describe it is one of these little
[54:36] kids it's about two or three years old
[54:47] and we are the ones that lets in demons
[54:50] come in them kids no I
[55:07] that baby has to learn from somewhere
[55:17] and it learn for me in you now whether
[55:23] it be good or bad I mean we thank the
[55:26] thought we hope to think we want to
[55:28] think that it was all good
[55:29] that we transmit it down to our kids but
[55:34] remember the little boy walking in the
[55:36] daddy's footsteps you know I didn't know
[55:43] they said anything to do with a new
[55:44] birth well from the stage of this
[55:53] cleanliness does it coming in with a
[55:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[55:58] Prophet said to burn out all now listen
[56:03] if he's right then they must be
[56:07] something left in here
[56:11] if the fiery baptism just to drive out
[56:15] everything that means that everything
[56:18] was that you just got rid of the devil
[56:23] you got rid of that you got to a point
[56:25] that if you remember in your Christian
[56:28] experience that you'd go do wrong and
[56:31] you repent you go back and you do wrong
[56:33] you repent you go back you do wrong you
[56:36] repent do you remember that you live it
[56:42] up and down life right you're not out
[56:48] stealing drinking smoking the quotes in
[56:52] here or the Prophet said you can still
[56:54] be tempted and sanctification you can
[56:59] still be tempted listen folks you ain't
[57:02] go like this but it's a baptism of the
[57:05] Holy Ghost you can still be tempted no
[57:10] it won't let me he won't let it beyond
[57:13] your control and what can happen
[57:21] what about this little baby that's the
[57:25] best way I can describe it little baby
[57:28] that's clean they don't know what seeing
[57:32] is they don't know any of those wrong
[57:40] that's kind of like one time we stopped
[57:42] and looked at a bird up on the side of
[57:43] the road in the cage and a guy walked
[57:45] over and he said don't say no dirty
[57:48] words woman I didn't intend to but I got
[57:55] the point he said cause that bird is
[57:59] gonna say what you say my uncle my aunt
[58:06] used to go through the house saying big
[58:09] long dirty words about him and you know
[58:13] what that bird flew through the house
[58:14] saying the same thing she said about him
[58:19] okay you get it we dedicate the baby
[58:26] Missy brother Dale is a little smarter
[58:29] than the average bear dedicating a baby
[58:32] is wonderful that's a great opportunity
[58:34] but what about getting the people to
[58:36] dedicate themselves to live before that
[58:39] baby so that baby can see Jesus Christ
[58:42] that should be the more gain of anything
[58:46] and why I do that is to splat point
[58:52] those you're not responsible for them
[58:54] kids
[58:55] well there's they got a new south
[58:57] nobody's playing the point that baby is
[59:02] beautiful perfectly clean but then
[59:05] gradually it starts drifting it starts
[59:12] saying things wrong doing things wrong
[59:19] remember the way I described it and I
[59:22] believe it
[59:22] the she virus that killed the 42
[59:26] children you know I mean where did they
[59:29] get that go up old ball head I mean
[59:32] little kids all right I mean that's
[59:34] what's running around they look at him
[59:36] in well let's call him bald hey well if
[59:38] you go up a bald head I never heard that
[59:40] before but now they heard Mama and Daddy
[59:43] sitting at the table talking I said what
[59:47] is that profit think he's got to do with
[59:49] it why don't he just go awful bald head
[59:54] I've told you my theory they're all the
[59:58] fed mom and daddy to the birth you don't
[1:00:03] like it I don't either but it's truth I
[1:00:05] don't intend for it to be part of my
[1:00:07] life but it's true right where did them
[1:00:11] kids get old bald head at where do they
[1:00:13] get all the things to say it again and
[1:00:15] God come down and killed through two
[1:00:18] bars
[1:00:28] because you see now let's move uh we've
[1:00:32] been talking about the baby I hope you
[1:00:33] got that point all right now let's move
[1:00:36] up that's me and you that's me and you
[1:00:41] what nature do you expect to be in there
[1:00:45] you get rid of your sin you get rid of
[1:00:48] your drinking you get rid of your
[1:00:50] smoking you get rid of your line you get
[1:00:52] out of this you know but what's there
[1:00:55] there is nothing to portray Christ you
[1:01:07] just clean you just blink and remember
[1:01:16] being clean that's wonderful great place
[1:01:22] to be to be clean but what if that
[1:01:25] unclean spirit comes back now did the
[1:01:29] Bible say swept and garnished kind of
[1:01:33] look like this you know the white on the
[1:01:37] internet and if they can't see it the
[1:01:39] white on the paper is representing the
[1:01:42] good and pure part of us and Satan the
[1:01:48] unclean spirit comes back if you don't
[1:01:52] get something in place of him he's
[1:01:54] coming back so what's the bet what's the
[1:01:57] point when we get to that stage there's
[1:01:59] were the dangers that because the
[1:02:03] unclean spirit can come back now did
[1:02:09] your prophet teach on anointed ones and
[1:02:16] did he teach about anointed ones that
[1:02:19] you are anointed on your spirit with the
[1:02:27] genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:02:31] another or go all those doctrines or
[1:02:34] thoughts or ideas but brother Dale I
[1:02:36] know I'm saved because I remember today
[1:02:38] have I cried they cried when
[1:02:42] they cry funeral you making fun of me no
[1:02:47] just telling it like it is
[1:02:49] oh brother branham has he got a part of
[1:02:53] that
[1:02:54] who would have dr. Davis and which one
[1:02:56] it was he preached his first sermon and
[1:02:58] he said what do you think about it dr.
[1:03:01] David he said worse sermon ever heard it
[1:03:05] said what they cried they said they
[1:03:08] cried funeral the cry twins
[1:03:10] he said but children are born by the
[1:03:12] word what about a Baptist preacher
[1:03:16] straightening out a prophet that don't
[1:03:21] fit too good does it
[1:03:23] but is it true do you understand what
[1:03:30] I'm saying what's in here even though
[1:03:32] it's swept clean and garnished what's
[1:03:34] that I mean you did if you got nothing
[1:03:39] to live with there's got to be something
[1:03:41] there to cause you to react to move to
[1:03:44] do they've got to be something about
[1:03:46] human elements that causes of thinking
[1:03:49] to desire to move see maybe were to talk
[1:03:58] about the new birth a whole lot more you
[1:04:00] might find out there some things about
[1:04:02] the new birth we never understood we
[1:04:05] might be where the Prophet said it not
[1:04:07] waged in the seals where brother Branham
[1:04:09] said there's a mysterious part of
[1:04:10] justification a mysterious part of
[1:04:13] sanctification a mysterious part of the
[1:04:15] baptism when the old goes under the
[1:04:17] seals a mysterious part wept and
[1:04:29] garnished but what kind of nature's
[1:04:32] ruling there
[1:04:40] No well would it be our nature of life
[1:04:47] that we left the snake the motivator
[1:04:53] that problem we can see as it could be
[1:04:55] booed out but yet the baptism of the
[1:04:59] holy ghost am there you just swept and
[1:05:05] garnished and the devil can come back
[1:05:09] now if the devil can come back now
[1:05:14] remember this is the soul so we took
[1:05:21] this off seeing out of the soul not out
[1:05:23] of the body
[1:05:24] not out of spirit or don't deal with
[1:05:25] that we take the unclean spirit out of
[1:05:30] the soul that leaves us so pure and
[1:05:35] great but if we don't get something to
[1:05:39] replace it Satan's coming back Satan's
[1:05:45] coming back and he's going to bring
[1:05:48] seven times worse and the Prophet said
[1:05:50] they become religious all right now they
[1:05:53] become religious now let's move up a
[1:05:55] step he said that's why you can't tell
[1:05:58] that one let's see and knoweth it not he
[1:06:01] said that's why you can't tell that
[1:06:02] woman that it's wrong for her to work in
[1:06:05] shorts and things go to her why
[1:06:17] Satan has come back in here he don't
[1:06:22] stop body they don't stop spirit he goes
[1:06:26] into where he come out from which was
[1:06:29] the soul but being a religious demon
[1:06:37] spirit memory reason conscious in time
[1:06:41] Satan comes right into that then you
[1:06:47] become an anointed one Judas cast out
[1:06:52] Devils heal the sick that's what your
[1:06:56] prophet said he said he went through
[1:06:59] salvation of justification
[1:07:01] sanctification Ricky here's your home
[1:07:03] will this ask you to read if not in
[1:07:05] coming out show you some other quotes so
[1:07:16] if that comes back then you put the
[1:07:20] snake back in there then you put that
[1:07:24] sin around our yet you put it in a
[1:07:26] potato
[1:07:27] how would you say it because you got a
[1:07:31] clean sweet wonderful place when Satan
[1:07:35] comes in he's gonna start bringing back
[1:07:37] his old nature and he's gonna bring back
[1:07:42] their religious demons and what is
[1:07:47] religious demons you can't tell me I
[1:07:50] don't believe the prophets message I
[1:07:54] believe everything he says just don't
[1:07:59] quote that to me too often ok I might
[1:08:02] bring up a few things me and you both
[1:08:04] have troubles with okay let's just do
[1:08:08] the best we can right let's just do the
[1:08:14] best we can go see that snake goes right
[1:08:18] back in there and that snake causes that
[1:08:23] soul to starts inning without here that
[1:08:27] spirit is anointed with a holy
[1:08:29] period is that what your prophet said
[1:08:35] and he said and you're still lost you
[1:08:39] wanna go ahead to number seven that's
[1:08:47] right
[1:08:51] yep let's pull up number seven many
[1:08:58] people can live in this spirit they can
[1:08:59] dance in this period they shout in the
[1:09:01] spirit they go to church in the spirit
[1:09:03] and they can absolutely have the real
[1:09:05] Spirit of God anointing on that spirit
[1:09:08] right not on the soul not in the soul
[1:09:10] part of doing the spirit memory reason
[1:09:14] conscious but how the Spirit of God
[1:09:16] anointing on that spirit but still be
[1:09:19] lost and just as devil possessed as they
[1:09:22] can be with that spirit because watch
[1:09:27] what's the reason you couldn't tell that
[1:09:29] woman she's wearing shorts was wrong you
[1:09:31] couldn't tell her bobbing her higher was
[1:09:33] wrong well what sure got to do with it
[1:09:36] well it did to sound some say the reason
[1:09:39] you can't tell her she's anointed how
[1:09:44] are you gonna tell people they're wrong
[1:09:47] when they have the anointing of the Holy
[1:09:51] Spirit on them and how same devils cast
[1:09:54] out seeing all kind of things happening
[1:10:02] come up and talk Donnie just a little
[1:10:06] bit about brother and I believe him he's
[1:10:10] got a true gift
[1:10:17] you can pray for the sick and they'll be
[1:10:18] healed but what about the rest of it do
[1:10:30] you see what anointed ones are anointed
[1:10:37] ones are people that can do things I'm
[1:10:41] gonna say it
[1:10:42] you don't like it they all do things it
[1:10:45] might be a lot of times being you can't
[1:10:47] do right because they got that anointing
[1:10:53] they can cast out devils they can heal
[1:10:56] the sick they can do all kind of works
[1:10:58] and wonders from that spirit realm
[1:11:01] outside of that and that snake still be
[1:11:03] inside let's see the Bible speaks when
[1:11:14] I'll do this we'll quit the Bible speaks
[1:11:16] are being washed by the water of the
[1:11:18] word all right what is to be washed by
[1:11:23] the water of the word it's a cleansing
[1:11:27] what drives out that unclean spirit
[1:11:30] sanctification the cleansing the
[1:11:33] cleansing and setting it aside drives
[1:11:34] out that unclean spirit all right what's
[1:11:37] going to keep it out fasting and praying
[1:11:43] and seeking God reading your Bible
[1:11:48] praying out to God now do you see why
[1:11:53] brother Dale says it then I don't
[1:11:55] understand why he said like that he said
[1:11:58] I draw the beast crying out to God every
[1:12:05] day of my life and wind up at the end of
[1:12:08] and find out I was okay then they're not
[1:12:11] searching my life how many of you ever
[1:12:16] not do you cry out to God God forgive me
[1:12:20] of my sins
[1:12:22] Lord lead me guide me open my eyes of
[1:12:27] this message my heart to receive it let
[1:12:34] your love be made manifest the
[1:12:43] sanctification is a cleansing set aside
[1:12:46] but it's a very dangerous stage right
[1:12:48] there because Satan can come back but he
[1:12:52] comes back religious where he used to be
[1:12:57] a drunk could this or an altar then when
[1:13:00] he comes back on that other side a lot
[1:13:03] of times he's clean on that he stays
[1:13:07] clean on that he doesn't go back out
[1:13:09] into the world of sin to do all those
[1:13:11] things
[1:13:12] he becomes religious he becomes
[1:13:17] preachers he becomes people who claim to
[1:13:21] believe the message
[1:13:30] and have genuine signs and wonders
[1:13:40] I told you we're gonna ask that question
[1:13:43] how do you know that you've been
[1:13:47] justified how do you know that you've
[1:13:53] been sanctified then when we get to it
[1:14:02] we'll ask it by Paul have you received
[1:14:06] the gift of the Holy Ghost since you
[1:14:10] believed is that what Paul said about
[1:14:17] but just remember what I'm talking about
[1:14:21] and that unclean spirit goes out if you
[1:14:26] don't get something to replace it he's
[1:14:30] coming back may take a little while but
[1:14:35] he's coming back and then you become
[1:14:38] very religious shouting speaking in
[1:14:45] tongues having glorious things and still
[1:14:49] be lost
[1:14:57] keeps getting stronger see because we
[1:14:59] asked the point to start with when you
[1:15:01] come to the altar and repented of your
[1:15:02] sins and you ask God to forgive you and
[1:15:05] a great experience comes upon you of
[1:15:06] those things and you you get to stand up
[1:15:09] feeling great and wonderful see them
[1:15:14] down the road it comes in a religious
[1:15:16] form religious demons to come and take
[1:15:22] over let Stan come on musician think on
[1:15:33] these things well I didn't know the new
[1:15:39] birth was such a complicated thing I
[1:15:44] thought it's just going to dollar and
[1:15:46] accept Jesus chronic that's what you've
[1:15:48] been told but words that in the Bible
[1:15:52] words it in the prophets message sure
[1:15:56] come on
[1:15:57] but remember let's quote all he says
[1:16:00] let's don't take one time let's take all
[1:16:04] he says he told the girls he had a
[1:16:08] problem and she'd come to the altar and
[1:16:11] was prayed for she got up went back out
[1:16:15] into the world now I can give you this
[1:16:16] but I'm paraphrasing it clothes went
[1:16:19] back out into the world went along
[1:16:24] either then she come back to the Prophet
[1:16:27] she said I've went out in the world I've
[1:16:29] done wrong he said well let's pray he
[1:16:34] prayed for a while and she got up you
[1:16:36] remember and she said I got it this time
[1:16:38] I'm I've got he says no you didn't get
[1:16:41] it what he told her he said get back
[1:16:47] down you didn't get it well she went
[1:16:52] through the Prophet and all of these
[1:16:53] things and the great experience of dicta
[1:16:56] that he spoke of her having he said
[1:17:02] after a while said she got the praying
[1:17:05] said after a while if she come through
[1:17:08] and said I knew then she
[1:17:11] headings that I told her said now you
[1:17:13] got it see she never went back out into
[1:17:15] the world after that she had it let's
[1:17:21] see that religious demon was telling her
[1:17:22] she had it when she come to the altar
[1:17:26] probably said you didn't get it
[1:17:28] in other words why was he saying if he
[1:17:30] did if you got it you would be back out
[1:17:33] in the world
[1:17:36] come on that's one of in teaching
[1:17:38] justification if it's Union what we
[1:17:40] won't go back out into the world you
[1:17:45] women will ha no trouble cutting higher
[1:17:47] paint your faces and your dresses being
[1:17:49] too short to worse men sometimes have to
[1:17:52] be embarrassed well no well I don't
[1:18:00] preach a lot on that but is it true
[1:18:05] the dresses got a little sword around
[1:18:08] here and some and then they drop it in
[1:18:10] the dark
