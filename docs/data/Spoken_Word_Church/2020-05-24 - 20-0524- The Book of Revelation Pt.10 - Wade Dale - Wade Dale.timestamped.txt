[0:08] all right real quickly here they're
[0:14] gonna be here today this is vegan
[0:17] service of Lord coming in so just obey
[0:24] Him in trying about get this thing over
[0:27] with
[0:32] far they can go you know all right so
[0:49] we're probably last study about the
[0:53] Laodicean Church a layout in church JS
[0:55] is the last Church a I think some water
[0:58] an island then we're coming in so they
[1:00] the Laodicean Church age the property
[1:03] God tells us was the worst church age of
[1:06] all of them because everybody thinks
[1:11] they're right I am ready
[1:13] increased with Goods and have need of
[1:15] nothing no it's not that don't wretched
[1:18] miserable poor blind naked you don't
[1:20] know it go over paraphrasing one program
[1:23] said that there's a group of people that
[1:26] this is the most religious time
[1:28] supposedly the best illumination of
[1:33] Revelation this is the this is the
[1:35] greatest hour of all the church ages
[1:38] because they've all went through the
[1:40] different stages when we've been through
[1:41] all the different stages and then we
[1:43] just come with Luther Wesley and
[1:45] Pentecost and then we were with just the
[1:49] case that getting back to
[1:50] in an idea like you were talking about
[1:55] last Monday about the half tribal
[1:58] Manassas was on this side of Jordan and
[2:00] half of it went across from the other
[2:02] side of Jordan which means that the holy
[2:04] ghost there's more to the holy ghost
[2:06] than just receiving the baptism of the
[2:08] holy ghost
[2:08] okay and that's what - it's good the
[2:12] days would come through that brother
[2:13] Graham some with the prophet and God
[2:15] sent us a prophet and our sentence
[2:16] probably tell us what what you tell us
[2:19] okay
[2:22] he told us how to get back to this
[2:24] trkage right here but then you got a
[2:27] plus it and give it more to revelation
[2:30] 10 7 in the days of the voice of the
[2:31] seventh angel when he begins us down the
[2:33] mystery of God should be finished they
[2:36] didn't have the mystery they had part of
[2:39] the mystery you am NOT a human being
[2:41] part of the sewol church age
[2:43] number seven is completion so this
[2:46] completes the mystery all right so
[2:48] that's 100 that the Prophet told us
[2:51] there was a lot of light in these first
[2:53] ages that went out almost completely
[2:55] that's why they call it the Dark Ages
[2:57] and then you see a little shoot I mean a
[3:01] little to Sprague's means to shoot and
[3:03] then you see the shot but that's really
[3:05] not the seed the seeds in them all my
[3:12] corn in plans that we planned and all
[3:14] the other things they ever been of the
[3:15] fruit that we're going to harvest you
[3:17] can harvest one one speck of it at this
[3:21] moment
[3:22] but if you didn't able to plant it and
[3:24] you just looking up there and you see
[3:26] this bear and field let's get out the
[3:29] problem hey why yes but the analogy I
[3:33] want to show you is is you you're like a
[3:35] farmer that walks out into the field and
[3:37] he's planted nothing zero and he walks
[3:42] out in the field in two months later you
[3:43] go for now I'm going to get corn
[3:44] three months later I've got corn coming
[3:47] up and I'm gonna harvest my corn
[3:49] if you look out then it's just a barren
[3:50] field well that's what it's talking
[3:52] about you say I am rich you say that
[3:58] your increased with goods that you're
[3:59] going to get this bountiful harvest you
[4:01] won't have the feeling you go where's
[4:05] the did you know let it plant nothing
[4:08] but but we can get a harvest that's what
[4:11] the whole problem is now mm-hmm
[4:13] I say when I say denomination the world
[4:16] I don't mean them out there I mean the
[4:17] ideas that we go denominational ideas we
[4:20] have are not see they might be seed but
[4:23] they're we'd see they're not grain
[4:26] they're weeds go deers gonna weed will
[4:28] come up because we've to see a siege
[4:31] don't come out of the ground they come
[4:34] up yeah we know that
[4:35] jinda okay well we have to cut them down
[4:42] little uh we can't live with well cut
[4:46] them they only Jim said yesterday we
[4:48] were pulling corn there was a lot of
[4:51] weeds and she said can't we just use
[4:53] this for salad or something right
[4:56] can't we just let this grow and and it's
[4:59] green and it looks good piece of plan
[5:01] but that's the same thing I was thinking
[5:03] about for today
[5:05] it's got life in it but it has no
[5:08] purpose except to be cut down are the
[5:11] big are they're not going to be
[5:13] harvested they're going to be cut down
[5:14] and burned but but what we planted a
[5:19] month or so ago corn dori up this high
[5:22] all the different things are already up
[5:24] might get some squash in the next week
[5:26] or two but praise the Lord
[5:29] thousand level
[5:34] the heels if you have we got a giveaway
[5:37] of one jubilee situation we have listen
[5:45] real well you can have planning but the
[5:49] situation we had was is my mother
[5:51] through some through some swine up in
[5:55] the garden last year and it went to see
[5:58] well when it come out we come up like a
[6:00] bush so I took of them and replanted
[6:02] them in different places so we come up
[6:04] with fifty and we'd already bought 20
[6:06] plants and leasing them plants them out
[6:09] of seeds so we got I do believe the
[6:19] church nearby but back to my point
[6:25] speed was planted I know that I'm the
[6:28] store of the sea now I'm not the son of
[6:31] man but the Sun man is the one who sowed
[6:34] the seed there he knew
[6:35] I know what's in every one of those
[6:37] roads but I planted it the Bible tells
[6:40] us that revelation 10 7 that we're going
[6:43] there's going to be a voice of the
[6:46] seventh angel messenger that's going to
[6:47] bring us to fruition not the two shoots
[6:50] not the stock we've got corn up some up
[6:54] about this high every year corn is in
[6:57] that life is in it
[6:58] but it's not the corner it's not to see
[7:01] we've got to get back to see right the
[7:05] Bible says the corn of wheat falls in
[7:06] the ground it and died to divide alone
[7:08] but when it comes up it brings forth
[7:10] what much fruit so you're now coming to
[7:12] a place excuse me that I don't want
[7:14] everybody to understand boom
[7:16] it's wonderful to receive the baptism of
[7:19] the holy cultures wonderful to be
[7:20] baptized it's wonderful to do all these
[7:22] things wonderful to listen to tapes and
[7:23] all these different things but if you're
[7:26] not born again your wheat see your
[7:31] covers you're going to be cut down you
[7:33] may look good you may look nicely
[7:35] I'm telling you like right now in our
[7:39] garden you have to be careful because as
[7:42] Jim we were looking at yesterday the
[7:44] corn and grass yet this high looks
[7:48] exactly the same all you have to look to
[7:51] the characteristics or the
[7:52] characteristics of corn is it rolls the
[7:57] leaves role when grass starts growing
[8:00] the leaves are like like this so if you
[8:02] see it rolling
[8:03] that's the corn see then you pull around
[8:05] it well that's what God is doing now
[8:07] he's he knows whose seed but we don't
[8:10] yet but when all the weeds get pulled
[8:12] out of the lake you can see the big rows
[8:14] of corn and all you see is corn well
[8:16] that's what God's done he says I counsel
[8:18] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[8:21] that down that's be rich and white ran a
[8:23] paper when we get done in about two
[8:26] months from now we're gonna have a lot
[8:27] of corn and we're gonna have a lot of
[8:29] bean who's gonna have a lot of squash
[8:31] zucchini matters and diet not taters but
[8:36] matter hey yeah we're not a lot of
[8:38] tomatoes do but uh but you see that's
[8:42] potential look look all this is
[8:44] potential it was corn seed right here
[8:48] it was corn seed and every one of these
[8:51] but it only got to a certain place that
[8:53] God said Lane I'm but I'm happy if them
[8:56] two ships don't ever get out of the
[8:57] ground
[8:58] you get no crop so the two shoots had to
[9:01] come out of the ground under lugar real
[9:03] simple two shoots coming up like this
[9:06] Wesley the stock starts growing
[9:09] Pentecost is the husk that looks kind of
[9:11] like the wheat but right inside of it
[9:15] it's where the life is that's the life
[9:16] that come from what seed to here and
[9:20] that's okay to have to be shuk - shuk
[9:23] protects to see but remember everything
[9:27] at the end of our process of crop
[9:30] gathering basically with wheat no we
[9:33] don't have we plan but we have other
[9:35] things we like to gather when they're
[9:37] alive but if we will wheat farmers you
[9:40] have to wait to that link completely
[9:42] dies it
[9:43] the most deadlight right now it looks
[9:45] the most dead has ever been but inside
[9:48] of the letter that one week that's got
[9:51] all the life in it now all the life and
[9:53] energy of that plant has went into that
[9:55] seat not that we don't need it but we
[9:58] don't need this anymore you know why we
[10:03] have the life we don't have the stock in
[10:06] this know we needed it
[10:08] then get don't get me wrong we need all
[10:09] that that's true that's why I'm talking
[10:11] about upstairs a journey of a believer
[10:13] you've got to have that journey to
[10:16] choose the journey of the stock the
[10:18] journey of them of the husk that comes
[10:21] out but inside that did you the journey
[10:24] of a believer and thank God that we can
[10:27] look at a simple plant and see your
[10:30] journey in life at the christian the
[10:32] life in the sea it dies okay
[10:36] the seed actually dies what it does is
[10:39] it fuel that you read in biology or none
[10:42] of those things look the Steve actually
[10:44] month up with water and swells when it
[10:48] cracks open that releases the life okay
[10:51] so Jesus Christ had to be the corn of
[10:53] wheat that went in the ground they died
[10:55] soaked up the water he was worth and
[10:59] then when he come forth on they
[11:00] Pentecost that was the life came back
[11:04] into the believer so then he can have a
[11:06] more of a crop that's William bleed boy
[11:09] so rather round they come to bring us a
[11:11] new way to get born again one of the
[11:13] things this is this endtime messenger
[11:15] down over here didn't come to bring us
[11:17] anything different anything that's not
[11:20] in the Bible he couldn't have can't be a
[11:23] word prophet and and bring something
[11:26] different but he did bring us what he
[11:29] brought us took complete love letter not
[11:31] just pieces and parts of it pieces and
[11:33] parts of it are okay he restored yeah
[11:37] well now hold on but he restored but
[11:38] that's not all he restored us back to
[11:44] what what about his women in Lord Jesus
[11:46] Christ no eternal hell the way we dress
[11:50] and act the
[11:52] vacation on steroids is what I call it
[11:55] thank you Jason on steroids go thank you
[11:57] patient back in either even in even in
[12:00] well even in Pentecost when Pentecost
[12:01] first started coming in mm-hmm they had
[12:04] short hair that they started wearing
[12:05] pants and different things on end of
[12:07] their journey but God had sent a
[12:09] property to write ever build that right
[12:11] righ T to make it right all right he
[12:15] brought it in other words he brought the
[12:16] plant back to cleaned all the leaves out
[12:18] from around it but now that's okay
[12:21] because you've got a plan but where's
[12:24] your harvest the property God was not
[12:27] sent to bring us a new Newberg he said
[12:31] he was sent to bring us a new birth from
[12:33] according to Malachi 4 which meant that
[12:35] it wasn't a new new birth different from
[12:38] the rest of these but it took you on to
[12:40] profession of a statue of a perfect man
[12:44] this was never taught me ages not sure
[12:46] it was taught here because Peter wrote
[12:48] about it but remember it went away one
[12:51] week died when the ground and not see of
[12:54] the Dark Ages they come back to shoot
[12:56] Dolph tassel then we got over here where
[13:01] we are is the full ear of corn
[13:02] just like the season was breaking it's
[13:08] not just that corn that you can eat you
[13:11] got to wait for it to your heart right
[13:14] and they make it planted need to replant
[13:17] it so that's what we're doing is we're
[13:18] going through maybe as the world may see
[13:21] of the drying time for Christianity I
[13:23] and I want to say again I'm glad that at
[13:26] least President Trump have enough
[13:27] gumption about itself to walk out there
[13:29] and tell everybody and y'all get out of
[13:32] an abortion clinics and if y'all can
[13:34] have your liquor stores open city you
[13:37] need to open churches well he said
[13:38] places of worship so thank God for that
[13:42] that he's at least got some sense about
[13:45] him to do that
[13:46] but do I guess this weekend
[13:50] based on until we're at listen we're ok
[13:53] we're done we're done
[13:54] we're fine we're doing but what I'm
[13:58] saying is the world they look at said
[14:00] well this is the dark time but to me I
[14:02] think about this yesterday this time now
[14:05] it's the time I told you about of a
[14:08] revival you're you were thinking that it
[14:11] was your fill the church's double he's
[14:12] gonna have a choir and we were gonna
[14:14] have you know we won't have shouting
[14:16] speaking in tongues that's not why he's
[14:18] preaching a revival is what I say an
[14:21] individual revival stone are gonna set
[14:24] up there some are never going to come
[14:25] back to church and I don't mean just our
[14:27] church would say some people that's
[14:28] never gonna come back
[14:29] this always happens but there'll be a
[14:33] group and there's my lesson there and
[14:36] just for example nailing and that there
[14:41] have been baptized and they come into
[14:42] the Christian faith they come closer to
[14:45] God that's a republic but it's
[14:49] individual because it may not catch on
[14:52] to mere or somebody but somebody is
[14:57] going to catch this thing and keep on
[15:00] going
[15:00] some are gonna say well I think I can
[15:02] sit at home or I think all I got to do
[15:04] to bleed brother around the property so
[15:06] you can believe brother around the
[15:07] problem he knows he is because he knows
[15:11] that there's only one God but what does
[15:13] he teach us a Trinity Satan literally no
[15:18] there's only one person he talked to
[15:21] one not a Jesus over here Holy Ghost no
[15:25] over here
[15:26] no the devil no there's one done and he
[15:29] talks to him all the time but he turns
[15:31] and gives us a three guy concept a
[15:35] father-son in the whole laughs one of
[15:40] that's deceiving that's the deceiving
[15:42] part your you know the deceiving part is
[15:45] is to walk down the street with not a
[15:47] stick to clothes on and think you're
[15:48] fully dressed that's what the world
[15:50] thinks that's what even the nominations
[15:53] and and you say well and I ain't talked
[15:55] about dress what you got on I'm talking
[15:58] about your religion because the Bible
[16:01] tells us when you look up that word
[16:03] religion
[16:04] it means covering and that's
[16:06] that only they did they didn't go back
[16:08] to God with no clothes on they talked to
[16:12] God no clothing on forever but something
[16:15] happened in their mind and in their
[16:18] consciousness that made them aware that
[16:20] they were naked still they wouldn't make
[16:24] big leagues which is a covering which is
[16:26] the rule they created a religion in the
[16:28] Garden of Eden and that's what you say
[16:31] well are you a Christian brother have
[16:32] many Tony's and you ask the are you
[16:34] Christian I'm bad at it that's the
[16:35] covering that's a religion that
[16:37] immaculate I'm paying off
[16:39] I'm brown line I gonna lose that's a
[16:44] religious covering we need to break out
[16:46] of that and by this goal the Word of God
[16:50] let down Lance be rich and white raiment
[16:53] what purity live a Pure Life get the
[16:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then go on
[16:58] that down max be clothed in other words
[17:01] if you're naked and realize it that's
[17:05] okay
[17:06] even if you literally were naked new
[17:08] anointing and you got this revelation
[17:11] that you were and then you went put on
[17:14] clothes what greater revelation would
[17:16] there be same thing with the Bible same
[17:18] thing with the prophets message hmm even
[17:20] walking around naked for years
[17:22] wipe the ground probably disparities no
[17:24] travel products prevent problem I have
[17:26] preacher say one time he was a messy
[17:28] parakeet at the whole board gun don't
[17:31] want a parakeet let me finish my point I
[17:34] don't want a parakeet he want what sons
[17:37] and daughters who died he want somebody
[17:39] that's what white raiment that thou
[17:41] mayst be clothed and that the shame of
[17:44] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[17:47] thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may
[17:50] see right what was it they wanted that
[17:58] my let me go purchase what is the
[18:02] purchase Bridget possession how are you
[18:06] gonna get clear how you gonna get go you
[18:08] don't abide by what living it you're
[18:12] gonna buy it by what purchasing coming
[18:15] to church
[18:16] and living the right line and we can
[18:19] lift upward if you want to strong and it
[18:22] says to purchase to rename
[18:33] fire sale all right so you went out and
[18:39] you bought it by the washing of the
[18:43] water the word how do you find go yeah
[18:47] not exactly wash you do not wash it with
[18:52] water you send this big strand of water
[18:55] down through this they used to cut the
[18:57] mountains into Lanka that's why you go
[18:58] up that long highway in Dahlonega
[19:00] a long time ago I remember when I first
[19:02] started working at James II in 1987 you
[19:05] could see a cut and that cut before they
[19:07] got on top of the mountain was a big ol
[19:09] jet of water and they just let the water
[19:11] go all the way down what happened was
[19:13] all the all the trash and all the mud
[19:16] went down to the bottom of the mountain
[19:18] and the gold is so much heavy it stays
[19:20] there so there was just this that's the
[19:23] same thing with washing ago are the work
[19:26] most of you gold is found in what creeks
[19:29] and rivers water it's always water
[19:31] associated we go so here that little
[19:34] gold nugget you got to be watched by the
[19:36] water the work you're always tell me
[19:38] it's there just got uncovered as many as
[19:44] I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[19:45] therefore and repent see still there is
[19:48] a way out you can repent behold that
[19:51] stands the door enough remember he's
[19:52] been put out of the church by the
[19:56] denominations by your mind your ideas
[19:58] and my ideas but all you gotta do to go
[20:00] door open or late a minute alright let
[20:04] it make you heart they made of the
[20:05] everyday life if any man hear my voice
[20:08] and open the door I will come in and
[20:11] we'll stop look he'll be in the know it
[20:14] don't be the darkest time that would be
[20:16] the most deceiving time this is the most
[20:19] intimate time God comes to us brother
[20:22] the most intimate everything else if
[20:24] you'll notice it says you'll get a new
[20:26] heart and you'll get in
[20:27] you'll get these different things I'm
[20:30] gonna come in and talk please
[20:32] debate and then if you overcome you're
[20:36] gonna sit with me in not on in my throne
[20:39] it's not you say but so I don't want
[20:41] Jesus beside me
[20:43] Satan has Jesus presiding hopefully I'm
[20:47] on time but there's no way that Jesus
[20:50] can get inside Satan does the door he
[20:52] turned him down but there's the way
[20:53] Jesus get inside of you and say that
[20:57] that's why I said the intimacy in this
[20:58] last days being the darkest days but if
[21:00] you'll overcome if you'll keep going
[21:02] keep keep asking God to give you a
[21:05] revelation he's going to grant to sit
[21:08] with me on my throne even as I overcome
[21:09] and I'm sitting there with my father in
[21:11] his throne because you know what he said
[21:12] I my father a warrant hmm brother Brown
[21:14] says when the bride excuse me
[21:17] begins to say I have my father what how
[21:19] could we do that because we're with him
[21:22] in his throne and then he sat down in
[21:24] the Father's throne we what we're one go
[21:28] go they'll be increasing upstairs that's
[21:33] what will happen is people can't swallow
[21:35] this people can't take that you are
[21:38] Jesus Christ in another form on the
[21:41] earth called a bride not another person
[21:44] the same person but not just the new
[21:48] birth but by the new birth plus all
[21:50] these and that the headstone is when you
[21:53] realize that what the headstone was who
[21:55] that son man not the son of God son of
[21:58] god was a spirit god it was the Holy
[22:00] Ghost that comes into you but when you
[22:01] come into you to do chained to you into
[22:06] God in human flesh called bride see some
[22:10] people change their head go there's no
[22:11] way you do that well that's the shuck
[22:13] the ship's going to dry up it's going to
[22:15] look like it it's a linen look it's a 50
[22:19] covers
[22:21] listen if if we would have had
[22:23] justification sanctification and then
[22:25] brother Brown was just come on the same
[22:27] with the power
[22:28] rationing had people wouldn't take it
[22:30] but God sent the holy ghost number day
[22:32] of Pentecost live the gifts of healing
[22:34] and comes and interpretation and trying
[22:37] to live right and doing the right thing
[22:39] and then God sent a prophet to step on
[22:41] this thing say hey you Pentecostals
[22:43] you're great I'm with you but you stop
[22:48] you stop we're going forward you stop
[22:53] you said tones of the elements and
[22:54] that's all it is that I can't go no
[22:56] further
[22:56] um does the ever that stuff and you
[22:59] remember that hmm I said my message
[23:02] that's two parts one like you said to
[23:05] restore back but the second part is to
[23:07] reveal those seven thunders or the seven
[23:09] seals that will change your body
[23:12] you've already been changed on the
[23:14] inside mmm 9/11 to the Waterside being
[23:17] she she physically gotta watch him
[23:20] but now God's gonna have to do a
[23:23] spiritual washing by the water of the
[23:25] word to let that go come out and let us
[23:28] be changed in this thing i baptize a lot
[23:31] of older people and they came back the
[23:33] older people but because it's not the
[23:36] time yet it's the beginning of the
[23:38] journey but if you walk on in newness of
[23:40] life as I was we were reading the
[23:42] scripture you walk in newness of life
[23:44] and God's gonna give you the holy oath
[23:47] plus I like that Holy Ghost plus cuz
[23:50] it's still the Holy Ghost but listen did
[23:53] they take did this church is how this
[23:56] muffle unfolding the discharge have the
[23:58] Holy Ghost just say yes it is mr. takes
[24:03] have the Holy Ghost
[24:04] the dish I'm holding up didn't know did
[24:07] not pull them you know all those fell on
[24:09] these people doesn't matter you you call
[24:12] them false if you won't do but they were
[24:13] true believers the Holy Ghost fell on
[24:17] what they had what the head was
[24:21] evidences of speaking in tongues and hey
[24:23] it's Bible can take it out and gift of
[24:26] healing but when they say this is it
[24:28] there's no more we're done pronounce it
[24:32] no you just get started and this ain't
[24:36] your requirement is like I said animal
[24:38] see the holy ghost but who took a body
[24:40] tan who is the alive and remain no one
[24:45] none of these people are alive and
[24:47] remain there all in the grave window
[24:49] menu to come to a place right here of
[24:52] saddling completion then step over into
[24:55] the eighth day the baptism of the Holy
[25:00] Ghost plus the change of this body the
[25:04] change of this body is going to be
[25:05] because of the washing of the war of the
[25:08] work you're going to realize there naked
[25:09] you've got to realize you need more and
[25:11] you're going to realize you need more
[25:14] than what mom and daddy says hey you
[25:17] know it's okay brother around the
[25:18] property you just believe that that's
[25:19] nonsense
[25:22] that's nonsense you got to know Jesus
[25:27] Christ first repent and be baptized you
[25:29] can't repent your brother branham you
[25:32] can't repent because of brother Brennan
[25:34] like Aaron preacher wins tonight this is
[25:36] your job you take you back to Calvary
[25:38] you take everything back to Jesus Christ
[25:40] and then you come and say okay night
[25:43] Jesus they died on the cross right here
[25:44] he's now inside of me in the fullness
[25:47] now we've got more word we've got all
[25:50] the word we've got the mystery of God is
[25:54] being finished which is what is the
[25:57] great mystery according to Colossians 1
[25:58] it says the mystery is Christ in you so
[26:02] we'll start with chapter 4 because look
[26:05] and after this and after all the church
[26:08] ages well Graham said there's when we
[26:10] take the rapture the door was open in
[26:11] heaven and I always come and I was taken

[26:17] place in our time I believe we'll be
[26:22] able to see it let's go come only though
