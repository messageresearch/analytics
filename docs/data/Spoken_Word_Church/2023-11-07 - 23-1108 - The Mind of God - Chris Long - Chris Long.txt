Holy Holy Holy holy holy yes holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen is that not our heart's desire and we can see him this evening even but here's the difference between the way we think we should be able to see him and the way we see him is if you close your eyes and look with the eyes of your soul you'll be able to see him God bless you thank you musicians it's a privilege to be in the house of the Lord with you yes it is a Tuesday night forgive me for disrupting your week but every once in a while there I guess there has to be a disruption amen an interruption of nature I think brother ROM called it but it's a pleasure as always to be here with you and and um you're you're just a part I know of the family of God and we're a part of the family of God so you're just an extended family all right or we're the extension of the family whatever you'd like to say but since it's Tuesday night and I realize that people have to work and they've been working and there's children that go to school I want to get right into the word of God if that's okay and uh we'll give it all we got for 45 minutes amen now what you're going to get is a lot of nuggets you polish them yeah that's right because I don't have time tonight to do that but I'm going to give you as much as I can I've been preaching uh at home uh and like most pastors really we preach in series and that series is from Genesis 1 yeah to the end of Revelation all right but the good thing about God is the Genesis was the beginning but there is no end to Revelation so if you would uh if you have your Bibles and you like to turn it's Proverbs 23 and: 7 uh familiar scripture I just thought I'd use it to to get you in your seats and it pertains to where we're going to be going tonight Proverbs 23:7 just the first part of the verse for as he thinketh in his heart so is he father we thank you this evening Lord for the reading of your word father that would be sufficient right there to bring to bring the universe into existence Lord Lord one word from you father is all it takes father and that's the way it would work Lord but tonight we're here father we want to settle ourselves down lord and we want to put our spiritual thinking caps on as the prophet told us Lord and and maybe fasten that seat belt Lord for a short ride we love you and we thank you Father and we'll be careful to always give you all the honor and the glory and the praise because of what you've done for us Lord in Jesus Christ's name pray amen God bless you may be seated now my voice might sound a little scratchy but you know coming from Arizona in that real dry climate and I don't come from the hot part of Arizona as most of you know we come from the cold part of Arizona it's a small place but it's cold and uh but still dry yes sir and whatever you got in the air around here just got my throat scratchy I don't really care I want to get into the word of God so so we we we've got this portion of scripture here everybody knows and of course we would paraphrase it as the prophet did for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he is that right we we understand that now I would like you to turn to uh Colossians if you would uh let's see if I got that right NOP NOP no NOP hang on hang on no no we done Proverbs already okay it's a Philippians chapter 2 amen amen it's a Tuesday night and every Journey for me is a long Journey long that's right brother amen I I shall I tell him my father's last name is Long my mother's last name was short y that's that's a fact that's why they didn't get along but God saw me that's it I do come from a broken family they didn't get along cuz they were Irish and they like to drink but through all that through all that God saw me I'm so thankful I tell you I'm so thankful I'm so thankful are you ready did I say Philippians 2 verse 5 everybody know this knows these scriptures let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus now if you're going to now listen this is a proposal did you know that right he's saying let this mind be in you so now it is a choice he's he's proposing to you to let this mind be in you now how do we know if we have that mind well that mind has particular characteristics first of of all it allows you to be in the form of God but not to think it's robbery to be equal with God now that doesn't mean you're going to be God that's right but you wouldn't think it was robbery for the Lord to come down and tell you that you came from him and you're going to go back to him CU brothers and sisters the whole the whole world is in chaos right now there is an identity crisis going on right everybody is trying to identify with what they think and what they believe and who they are I want to be identified with God so I want this mind and this mind has characteristics and attributes and they are identified in verse seven but made himself of no reputation so right away if you're going to let the mind of Christ be in you you are not striving for a reputation oh it seems like everybody wants to be reputed for something I want to be reputed for nothing amen cuz God takes nothing and make something out of it okay so that I want this mind and I want to let it be in me as much as you want to let it be in you so there are some characteristic requirements there's things you look for things that you want to identify amen sir by having the mind of Christ amen all right on brother he took upon him the form of a servant yes he did that knocks a lot of folks out amen they want to be served they're not interested in serving if you're not interested in serving you have not allowed yourself yet to receive the proposal of let this m amen being you right it's real simple it's not complicated all right and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself oh another requirement there it is another characteristic you see it's not the law of God we're talking about it's the mind of Christ and if you want to let the mind of Christ be in you then these characteristics are going to be the basis for it humbled himself oh my come on right and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross now I read those two script scriptures again I'm going to cover as much territory as I can but I want you to get this if you can't or you don't or you won't ponder it think about it meditate on it now when I was when I was ministering um on on a series about Abraham which I probably touched on here the last time I was here I began to think about Abraham and how that Abraham was different but then the prophet of God would tell us that Abraham was just an ordinary man he was a man just like or just like you and me just just a guy off the street who who who had a job probably didn't like it cuz it was work brother Bram tells us he was just a common guy would go out and you know pick vegetables and had his little plot and and he was just eting out a living now he came from a very think about this he came from a very uh uh successful area it was a very it was a very big area of wealth so probably Abraham didn't care about the the the things that everybody else cared about you know he had access to it but he wasn't interested in it he was an oddball as we would say he was a nut Lord but he was threaded right he was threaded right he was a nut but he was threaded right wasn't m n wasn't SAE Lord it was the word of God that was his thread amen now in this I started to think about how God was brothers and sisters look who doesn't want to be a child of God Amen well there are people who don't but we're here cuz we want to be right and it's easy to see that World War I is at hand now I say that cuz you see it in the news but has anybody ever noticed something about the news they don't want to admit that there is a God and that this is his word that's why they want to destroy Israel because God's word says Israel is my nation I don't care what what what she does I don't care how she acts I mean she's going to [Music] pay see mine mine amen believe that brother and I want you to notice that the media does not use Armageddon cuz that would give credibility to the word of God no this is World War I they say Amen we've been fighting in this battle since the day we stepped into the armor of God that's right if you only realize that there's a world going on around us that we we we can't see taste feel smell or hear now I I couldn't help but notice that brother Wade has a a print out on his desk of a Triune being and and I'm I I've been preaching on this for weeks yeah okay see I I gave you away your secret okay well let me set you up brother come on so let this mind be in you and then we see I I begin to see something so I'm not a theologian I'm a guy that's interested in God's word I'm interested in in in and in what God wants of us uh how he would like us to carry it out of course we have lots of baggage I would like to get rid of the baggage I I want I I want it to be a clean break amen I want to go all the way I know you do too but I'll use myself as an example so I don't embarrass anybody but I looked up the word mind come on man now let this mind be in you now the mind is is is is peculiar to its definition listen now the mind is a spirit in the dictionary you can get the same dictionary Mariam Webster whatever it is Spirit if the mind is a spirit or Force used to direct guide or give directions to one's thoughts oh soon as I read that brother wait I'm going to tell you he got me yeah because then I saw by definition the mind and the thoughts are separate right amen abolutely the mind is the conduit for the thoughts and if you want the thoughts of God you'll have to have the mind of Christ cuz he won't put his thoughts in anything else it's got to come down through that ch Channel now everybody listen now the access to God's thoughts are right here if voices are traveling through this room if pictures are traveling through this room right so are the thoughts they're right here amen right now amen and we all have access to the thoughts of God but it must be the mind of Christ now you do a little studying and you're going to find out that there that that that there there's a mind of God and here I am preaching on the mind of Christ why because all that God was he poured into Christ and the reason he could do it is because Christ had the right mind so we need to get our minds right now there's a problem with that brother Wade in that we seem to have two minds yes come on we have our brains and we have our heart what you say the brains that's just a mush yes right right believe me that's all it is amen and the heart is just the muscle y that's what it is but we found out there's a cavity inside the heart real small about the size of a pee that's available the prophet of God told us in his day that they found out that there's not listen close there's not even a blood cell in there well what's in there God voted for you Satan voted against you I'm going to tell you what's in there your vote and the reason there's not a blood cell in there is so that it cannot be contaminated until you make the choice right then it's either the blood cell of God or the blood cell of the enemy now you're on your journey and that's what started the thoughts of God I want to ask you a question what is more important be careful before you answer it's not a trick question but I want I want it to sink in what's more important the blood that is the carrier of the life or the life it carries that's right amen let that soak in a little bit the blood but it's it's it's got a purpose the blood in type is like the mind it's the conduit it's the carrier it's the vehic IC Le for the life now we know in the Old Testament you put the blood on the doorpost and the lentil so that it could be identified that a life had been given see but the life once the blood was placed on the doorpost and little left there's no life in there I love my I'll get an avocado because an avocado has a big seed that's why I like to use him as an example okay you can see that seed if I put it right there on the pulpit we're a Triune being amen but listen careful we were made in the image and after the likeness of then God's trying being think about it we were made in the image and the likeness of God if we were made in the image and the likeness of God then then then then God must we we must look like God but only in our Tri Unity remember when God made us Man In His Image it was not a visible tangible flesh man it was a spirit because God is a spirit so it was a spirit man catch that but that Spirit man was Triune amen you say well no it was invisible see we're trying to look with these eyes to see God I mean I'm going to get right into the meat of it if I can I'll let you out here in 5 minutes we're spending an inordinate amount of time and it'll become a waste of time if we constantly are trying to find ourselves in God In the Flesh right amen he is a spirit right amen so then it's going to take a spirit man to be able to identify with the spirit God not the flesh man so now we get into predestination oh you don't understand brother maybe I don't but I know who does this body of Flesh this guy you're looking at is not me n I'm I'm quoting the prophet I already know that the people I'm looking at it's not you well we spend a awful lot of time on who we aren't we take care of it we nurture it we we clothe it we feed it and we should why because it is listen close a vehicle yeah I know this sounds crazy I'm not telling you to wash your car brother Bram spent a lot of time keeping his stuff up not because he was OCD it was because he had a revelation that what God gave him required a certain responsibility can you imagine Adam the man put here Genesis 2:7 to till the soil and and and and tend the garden I get to tomorrow yeah yeah but look at the weeds yeah yeah I'll get to tomorrow listen careful before the fall I don't think there was any weeds but the seed was there the seed was there but not the weed itself so as long as Adam kept God's word that weed seed would never come up and Adam kept God's word but he had a other half did do you not think that God knew exactly what was going to happen I guarantee you if he's the God we believe he is he knows everything amen I do have something here on that if it's okay Brothers I'm sorry you didn't get this listen but we got a kingdom the falling apart of the world 1216 to 62 Jeffersonville and but we got a kingdom and in this Kingdom it has eternal life amen praise the Lord okay yeah not membership but eternal life am and it is governed by an eternal King amen an eternal Kingdom full of eternal life amen controlled by an eternal King to an eternal people amen come on that's us if you believe it's you it's you you fill that space in that heart with the germ blood cell of God and it's your kingdom too a kingdom is no good without participants absolutely right right I don't think you could call it a king if it was the King of Nothing no listen careful I'm not getting off my message but I I know where I'm going so I ain't gonna keep you here long to an eternal people that were predestinated listen careful before the foundation of of the world brothers and sisters that's not the body you live in this is a body of time am so there must be another you who is in another place at another time right now see predestination that's why brother Bram said it's a touchy word for the church because he knew that we were in a body an element a time frame a creature that that could only uh you know understand by the parameters and the and and the and the fences and the and the holes in the fence they're still trying to figure out what's in them black holes yeah you see they can see them but they can't see through them okay he said for those to an eternal people that were predestinated before the foundation of the world for those those who he fornew he called and those who he called he justified and those who he's Justified he has glorified Hebrews 11 he says that's right now it depends on what you're looking for amen amen you see brothers and sisters a long time ago I stopped looking for a connection between this Fallen man and God there's a man in here who can turn on the light there's a man in here who turns water to wine there's a man in here who gives sight to the blind I'm looking for him cuz I ask myself well where is he I believe he's in there what what's the problem right it's still in the form of a thought right it needs a conduit it needs a vehicle it needs the right kind of mind to that's what Jesus had that you and I are working towards but not by works now it's a battle that's what we're in we're in a battle and it is the greatest battle ever fought amen which has become the greatest battle ever thought right amen notice the time we live and excuse me does anybody know what AI is what is AI thank you but in my Bible it's a place in the Book of Joshua it's a battle an artificial intelligence unfortunately is what was guiding the person yeah who caused all the problems for Joshua and listen innocent people lost their lives in the Battle of AI I want you to listen careful now I have a whole message on that but I just want to put this in there you just look up artificial and then intelligence and you'll find out where the trouble is that's all Satan's got he does not have the intelligence of God so of course anything outside of that would be artificial you with me bogus it would be an impersonation of intelligence it would be bogus intelligence if you read your Bible you'll find out where AI comes in listen aen did not steal anything from AI That's not in your Bible he took from the previous Battle of Jericho because if you look in your Bible you'll find out that's where don't take nothing and and and and don't touch the accursed thing so what's my point please don't w't bring anything over from the previous battle or it will become artificial intelligence and it will cost you your life brothers and sisters and we're there now think about it ai ai ai we are to me it's anticipating intelligence if you ask me that's because because it doesn't seem like hardly anybody has any you know you you know what I'm saying it's like what can't they see that that that that that that's that's I mean can I give an example again I'm not but Okay so we've got this battle in Israel and and and Hamas I'm not talking about the Palestinians talk about a terrorist group attacks Israel and then people come out and say destroy Israel because Hamas is there's practicing genocide Hamas is not a nation no Hamas is a group of people who have decided to try to destroy Israel it's backwards they're trying genocide on Israel Israel's just protecting themselves from the from the people who are trying to destroy Israel think about it and but but oh oh they're they're trying to genocide the Palestinians no they're not no you and I know that we should it's so simple so where is is this Intelligence coming from AI amen and of course there's a price to pay it wasn't Joshua's fault it wasn't the warriors's fault who died in battle in AI it wasn't the warriors's fault who carried out God's word and went to battle it was somebody who decided that they would disobey God's word and sneak something into the camp amen kind of sounds like a word to the church with to me in Christ This Is The Mystery of God revealed kind of sneak in and fellowship and all everything's good everybody nobody knew brother that that aching was aching until innocent people began to die Joshua had a word from the Lord he said hold it all it right there stuff the battle I imagine that the people they were fighting going hey chickens Joshua knew if we're going to win another battle right if we're not going to lose another man we got to root this thing out we got to find out what's going on now he didn't know yet but then he was a prophet so God began to deal with him as a matter of fact let me tell you about Joshua he was a type of the Holy Spirit today and the Holy Spirit will use his ministry to root out and tear down destroy and run off every aen yeah ouch amen I'm just giving you the Bible I happen to believe it amen right amen it is hot in here isn't it is that me or the temperature okay thank you full of of eternal life controlled by an eternal King by his Eternal Word to a predestinated Eternal people amen that is why it always was always will be never had a beginning or an end in the mind of God when it was with God eternally and the purpose of God will be carried out so if we get into a a an INT ual discussion on predestination as I'm using for an example we'll lose every time because the human mind cannot make the connections because it's not connected to the human mind it's connected to the spirit of God which existed before the foundation of the world where the lamb was slain in the mind of God Amen yeah and then there was a book what was the book representative of the thoughts of God were put down on paper as the mind of God and it carried out right want you to see this for your thoughts and your mind are two different things that's why we have a battle going on inside of us there's two Spirits guess what they'll be so close how close are they they're in you right now amen and we are taking down the Enemy by taking over the territory that Lucifer thought he won but see he doesn't know the thoughts of God he's trying to manipulate the Mind amen he can't touch the thoughts of God but God has released to you and I in the day we live in the ability Christ is the mystery of God revealed and it all finish everybody knows these quotes but they are so delicious especially when you begin to come down to the level where you dying out to yourself and then God's thoughts begin the new resource in you right now God's secret mystery he had before the world began yes sir amen back in the back part of God's mind he was keeping it he was not letting it release it was in the conduit but it wasn't released it's like having a six shooter and there's one bullet back there that you sa for last you got five I'm out from out west so you long gun guys only get one shot guys in the west have two six shooters they don't have to be a good shot they just have to pull the trigger that's right just basically aim yeah okay he had before the rule began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something listen that he was trying and was going to achieve now what blew me away brother Wade is when I read the word trying God's trying this is God we're talking about he brought the whole universe into existence he he's omnipotent he's omnicient he's he's ones he knows everything and he's going to try to do something of course he's going to do it y right but I want you to understand something about God that I never realized until recently he's going through the same battles that you and I are because he set it up that way you see he became us so we could become him now when I say us we're all thinking this guy here no let us make man in our image he became us so we could become him this thing right here is nothing but an old beat up car I noticed you got a new one but you drive it long enough it's going to break 10 year warranty yes I'm wait until the batteries go out I know it but I want everybody to understand the example look at our bodies oh you you you young people in here I I remember when I was 18 192 look out I lost a few fights but I got into a lot of them CU I was a smart alec now I want you to know I got saved from that amen when somebody comes across brother with something and then they say you know we go I got saved from that I don't do that anymore because I was from the world I wasn't from the church so I could when I I could spot a worldly Spirit a thousand miles away why cuz I got Sav from that yeah right that's I don't I I don't go there no more now somebody that was raised in the church you just hear my son Ronnie he'll tell you all about it yeah he'll tell you yeah on the front Pew you know Dad's the pastor blah blah blah blah and he found out one day by looking in the mirror you scoundrel you you dirty dog all this time you thought just because your dad was saved and preached the message and was a pastor of the church that you had it going on yeah who was that down in there who is it inside of you brother B say that's not you that comes from somewhere else and that's what I'm preaching on I'm preaching on the mind of God Amen but the mind of God is the conduit that God's thoughts Channel Through why do you think he brought the pillar of fire into existence the pillar of fire is a conduit how do I know that because when that Pillar of Fire shows up occasionally an angel steps out of it you know he's six foot tall 200 lbs right right yeah he's not smiling no he's not because he's serious I I don't think it's because he can't be happy I think it's because God didn't make him that way God made him to be serious did you know that there's a part of us that wants you and I to be so serious about God's word I'm not talking about becoming some kind of religious nut yeah you know some some person that everybody goes oh there go I'm talking about a person that people go there's a real Christian right there I tell you what I've I've ruffled that fella or that girl's feathers and I I made fun of her or him for doing this and that and they just I'm praying for you yeah amen see that's that's now we're getting to the mind of Christ oh no we want exact Revenge right away God said I'll take care of it didn't he see see now we're putting on a different mind we we realize that there is going to be Revenge but God will take care of it how is he going to take care of it by presenting those people with the same opportunity that you were presented and whether they accept it or reject it that's why we never know who is and who's not right now you say well I'm I'm I've been working on this person for 40 Years brother Brandon when he went beyond the curtain of time met a lady who was over 90 now when she got there she was 18 19 years old in the epitome of Youth and brother brandom didn't even recognize her don't you recognize her no I don't recognize her she was over 90 years old when she gave her heart to the Lord in one of your services yeah amen so all that time there was somebody else in there it just took a time and a season and the right word and the right Ministry to say guy's talking to me does he know me did you tell him about me yeah right see because automatically that's what we fall into y we do because we're trying to make a connection with the flesh when our connection is the soul amen the problem with the fall is that Lucifer was allowed to interrupt the spirit amen he won access to the Mind notice I'm pointing at my head but really my mind is is a spirit it's just that we're identifying it here and the prophet of God did too see it's got to come into your intellect first and then you make the decision by what's down in the heart for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so you're thinking here and you're thinking here come on don't tell me that there's not a person in here that hasn't laid down in bed at night and an argument ensued with yourself I mean it could be over anything I just want you to understand that there's it seems like there's two of us now in closing I want you to see something God set it up so that he would himself go through the same process because he'd never asked us to do anything that he wouldn't do himself first watch now you say you're talking about God this is the god I'm talking about God created the heavens and the Earth and God said creation Universe galaxies and he made man rested things got awfully squirely they got so out of hand that his daughter allowed her intellect to interfere with God's thought now God's thought didn't stay there it didn't get contaminated it did not get uh hybrid no it can't it can't work through a contaminated pipe it's got to be clean and S ified just and and that's what sanctification is don't you want God working through you it's not a bunch of dos and don'ts it's you getting your spirit into a position where God says okay now go a little further do this you know suggestions do this do that don't do this don't do that you see we got God all wrong we think God's got a baseball bad I noticed you had one in there brother Wade but I won't bring it out no don't bring it out we we think God's got a baseball bat and he's one he's just right there at the plate waiting no one thing and whack that's the devil got us thinking that anybody ever think about this what is God a spirit that's Bible how does God appear a light that's Bible but who is God God is love see that's the part you can't see and you can't buy it that's why the prophet of God said go down to the drugstore and buy me a couple of you know couple of quarters worth of Love I'd like to have it you can't do it it's the thoughts that's what that's who God is he's love he doesn't want anybody to fail he doesn't want anybody to fall he doesn't want anybody to be lost we're making that decision amen he made his free moral aliance he said I've done this what are you going to do right I've done this what are you going to do I've done this what are you going to do well if we're going to allow God to work through us then we must let this mind which was in Christ be in us I'm looking at clocking you're good there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had leten now a motive in doing it down a little further so in his great mind he he he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love amen in him was to be father in him was to be son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God Amen now we all have heard this and we all know that but without me turning to it if you went to First John 5: 7 and 8 you'd see that the father and the word are one he's a Triune being but it's not three people it's not three separate Gods it's it's and I I've said it so many times but I feel led to say it again I'm a father I'm a son and I'm me yeah right brother Boyd brother sir I'm still one you take a knife and cut me in half it's still me right Body Spirit and soul steal me am steal you right brothers and sisters it shouldn't be hard for us we're made in the image and after the likeness of God so then God also is Father Son and Holy Ghost amen but guess what the really good part is all that the father was he poured into the son so that makes them 2third of one and all that the son was because the father was always already in there he poured into Christ Christ is the Holy Spirit that's available to you and me am all that God was is available to you and me what was God he was a spirit see I want you to I want to keep going over that so you'll just think about it we're trying to make an attachment we're trying to figure out God by our intellect by science by education by what we can see taste feel smell here about what we can Reason by our memory by our affection the connection is down in here and if and and as a man thinketh so is he if we don't think properly so that he can come in past all that disruption and those Gates that open and closed and get plugged up y our eyes think about it that's why I said if your eye offends me you pluck it out I don't think he literally wanted you to pluck out your eye I think he wanted you to close it he close it to those things that that draw you away well you say brother I ain't got time that's all we got I realize it's a short amount of time in the day we live in but it doesn't take but listen careful a twinkling of an eye Amen to change everything a twinkling of an eye that's the Bible amen let me finish I'm going to go over to the next page Brothers let me put my glasses on I don't know if the paragraphs will coincide with this old book but paragraph 105 says now God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery so there's two things a purpose and a hidden Mystery amen and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and H and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living in okay amen paragraph 106 he kept it a secret nobody knowed nothing about it even the angels didn't understand see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence well listen what what do you think what do you think that means who's not thinking in the room well the person that's sleeping back there but they're dreaming yeah listen who's not thinking in the room who's not using their mind how loud is it see because God is allowing You and I by the opening of that seal to get back into his thoughts and I'll close with this I can keep going but I'm gonna close listen William Shakespeare maybe the most well-known greatest most prolific playright ever known he must be everybody copies him yeah but he wants to play the part of Romeo Juliet or aell or whoever it is yeah in all of the history that I've studied about William Shakespeare I only looked it up for one reason now he never ever played one of the characters he wrote about and all of his playwrights came from his thoughts through his mind out to the end of his hand kind of like our Bible and and he began to write what he saw in his mind think about it I mean you young people how about JK Rowling maybe that would be fast forward from from Shakespeare she never played one part and and and and she's not that but something came out from her thoughts to her mind and she began to put it all down I mean where did Harry Potter come from yeah right now if you really can I can I can I say in the first seal in this act tonight that's that's a quote you you understand I got it up there but amen there's only one group of people on the planet outside of Jesus Christ that don't have to play someone else's part because if you were in and you wanted to know let's say if you were a girl and you were going to play the part of Juliet if you were a guy and you wanted to play the part of Romeo there's only one place where you could really get the inside scoop on the character and what they really represented in his writings and that was sit down with Shakespeare hey William listen buddy uh I'm going to play in and I I kind of want to you know I want to pull on you a little bit here come on did you get that I want to pull on you a little bit here that's part of the third pull we're pulling on him the Believers are pulling on him why because they want to know exactly how to be who God wants them to be so in order to do that you'll have to get into the mind and the mind is the passageway to the thoughts amen I want to know him amen you know why they all find me if you want to know him you'll find you and to me yeah that's what the message of the hour represents right it's not a battle axe it's not a toothpick it's not something some guy said I don't believe William Brandon was God right any more than I believe you are he was a representative of God being used by God to portray what was in the original thoughts of God and truthfully brother Brandon was being used as the mind of God but he realized that the mind of Christ was necessary in the hour we live in in order to receive all of the thoughts of God without anything being held back that's why I'm reading this to you right okay how long have I been up here would somebody please tell me Terrence you keep track tell me no 45 okay I I understand that's why I asked them because I knew I'd get an answer just like I'd give brothers and sisters there's so much more I mean I I'm not the only person that's God has called to try to do everything in his power to express it to you but you have access you have access to the same but but we have to put away our old selves you're listen young people you're dying don't tell me that you're dying right I was young like you once but you're dying it's just going slower right now the food you eat is rebuilding yourselves to make you feel young and vibrant but let me tell you something you stick around here long enough see because I want it to be real don't waste your youth that's my only regret is that I God called me at about 21 and 3/4 years old I wish he'd had called me at two yeah seriously amen what why because the scar tissue is immense right let me tell you the most powerful weapon that Lucifer's got is your memory because see he called when he got to Eve he said and God said he was pulling on what she knew about what God Said but she didn't read enough she didn't pray enough she relied too much on her outer senses and when he said God has said surely thou shout man there's some shouting go it should be a Pentecostal meting but not oh oh can't accept that because in my memory I remember that's not what God Said God said it this way and brother bam told us when those five gates work for the word of God that's right brother you got it going on but as soon as one of those Gates begins to work against God's word stop right there let your free moral agency let your self-will rise up and say listen here partner now you're talking to yourself listen here you you're not the real me well they'll think we're nuts but look at the world Amen they think they's somebody else I don't understand how anybody puts any credibility in Hollywood not one actor actress why because they're playing somebody else God's letting you and me have the opportunity to play ourselves please stand oh I just love God's word it's the best it's the best here let me cut to the chase I'm going to read you two paragraphs while you're standing and stretching and the musicians are coming listen to this part now right here he says uh this Brothers is uh paragraph 209 and then comes the revelation of the mystery remember he had a purpose one of them was a hidden Mystery then comes the revelation of the mystery to reveal what it's all been about where these little doctrines like Luther brought catechism and everything else and Wesley brought this that and the other and these other things and then Pentecost brought organization just the same Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism and things not knowing any different but then come cuz then come back in the last days and pick up all these Mysteries and clearly explain it reveal it why it's all the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart now we're going from the from the from this part of God down to this part of God how do I know that God has two parts y right because when the children of Israel got under his skin he said Moses you get out of the way I'm G wipe him out I'm gonna start with you think about this is god of love now he was in a battle cuz he set it up that way you read in your Bible in the days of Noah and it said it even griev even grieve God that he made man what no oh God is love have you ever read what the prophet said love is correction always he says corrective but it's not correction A A as as let me get my big stick and beat on you for a little while it's listen listen honey uh you know if you keep playing out in the middle of the street you're going to get squashed so I'm going to correct you and not let you play out in the middle of the street now if you're going to be stubborn it goes further the paddle comes out restriction oh I've said this a thousand times when my dad one he knew he knew me brother I wanted a whiping 10 times over and he whooped restriction go to your room stay in there for the weekend this is pretty is it that's the way I felt about it all the kids outside playing Paper tag on their bicy I'm in my room I would ask my dad would you please come give me a weapon he knew see I showed my weakness see watch this last thought uh let's see Brothers it's going to be on page 54 uh got to have my glasses I hate to use my glasses but I got to have them paragraph 395 look look what was once God's Great secret great mysterious Secret in his mind is now put in the hearts of the believer but it wasn't put there to stay it was put there because as you think in your heart so are you it was put in there so you could identify who you are because of where you came from and once you know who you are because of what where you came from there's no problem with where you're going if anybody ask you where I'm going where I'm going [Music] soon you got that if anybody ask you where you're going where you're going soon you're going up yonder mhm you're going up yonder well you're going up yonder to be with your [Music] lord going up yonder M you're going up yonder thank you buddy you're going up yonder to be with your Lord amen [Applause] the real you that's that's right the real you man's never seen the real you that's right but God has on he saw you before the foundation of the world right so he knows who you are that's right he knows what you're doing here like we were talking about placing all that the placing it's not placing of of of Chris long as a as a pastor and as um you know his name is Chris long and he lives in Flagstaff and he's got the church in it's that guy inside the soul that's what God wants to place because before the foundation of the world it was placed because remember God don't change God don't make a mistake he didn't put you over here and then all of a sudden when you get down here he goes no I'm going to put you over here no but what do we got to do like brother Chris said we got to get into that that's right get into that channel that's right and let God take us to where we need to go boy that was good let's sing a song before we dismiss if you have a need let's pray for brother Chris and sister Joanna
