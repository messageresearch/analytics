[43:17] reading there in Dr Luke's gospel you
[43:21] know he speaks of uh this Foundation
[43:29] and this morning I'd like to speak on
[43:31] the true foundation right the the true
[43:36] foundation and the Bible says here in St
[43:39] Luke 6 and verse
[43:44] 47 whosoever cometh to me and hear my
[43:47] sayings and doeth them I will show you
[43:51] to whom is
[43:53] liken is liken unto man which buil a
[43:57] house and dig deep and lay the
[43:59] foundation on a
[44:03] rock and when the
[44:05] flood arose and the the the stream beat
[44:10] vly upon that house and the cloud not
[44:14] shake it it could not shake it for it
[44:17] was founded upon a Rock Amen and he that
[44:22] heareth and dwth not is like a man that
[44:25] with without a foundation build a house
[44:28] upon the Earth against which the streams
[44:32] did beat vly amen and immediately it
[44:35] fell right and the rain the ruin of that
[44:39] house was great may the Lord add his
[44:42] Blessing to the reading of the word you
[44:45] may be
[44:46] seated in the message of the oncoming
[44:49] storm brother Brenham St like this he
[44:52] said Jesus was speaking here of a coming
[44:55] stor storm which has got to strike every
[44:59] man and every woman that's born in the
[45:03] world Amen right there is just no way
[45:08] out of it that storm will strike you
[45:11] sometime or another yeah and depends on
[45:15] what kind of a
[45:16] foundation you have amen whether your
[45:20] house will weather it or not right there
[45:26] many lives saved because of preparation
[45:31] for storms right amen hallelujah and
[45:35] there has been many of lives lost
[45:38] because of failing to take heed to the
[45:42] warning of storms that's coming
[45:46] Hallelujah you know I I can remember the
[45:50] the first hurricane that had passed away
[45:53] uh it was the the very year that we were
[45:55] mared married and um you know the the
[45:58] young people in Jamaica had never seen
[46:01] an hurricane because the the last
[46:03] hurricane that had passed that time was
[46:07] 1951 and so 1988 there there was a
[46:12] projection that an hurricane was coming
[46:14] and you know the whole folks would have
[46:16] said you know we prayed that it didn't
[46:19] come but we young people we said man I
[46:22] want to see it I want to have an
[46:24] experience of this uncoming storm and I
[46:28] remember I was talking to an old guy and
[46:30] you know I said what what it was in 1951
[46:33] when this this hurricane strike he said
[46:36] he said the only thing that I can tell
[46:38] you after the storm had passed as far as
[46:43] your eyes can see because all the trees
[46:46] were gone houses were gone but you know
[46:50] what we never seen it so he said I want
[46:54] to see the star
[46:56] I want to be a part of that storm oh
[46:59] yeah but you know I remember that night
[47:01] when the storm
[47:03] strike oh yes oh yeah and we had there
[47:06] waiting that this is it there is
[47:10] something about the storm it it goes in
[47:13] one direction and then after you know
[47:16] it's moving in a circle and it goes in
[47:19] One Direction so it pass you moving one
[47:21] way and and then there's a cal yeah yeah
[47:25] and they they call it the eye of the
[47:28] storm and you know when the high came
[47:31] that there's a lot of people were happy
[47:33] oh the storm had passed but they didn't
[47:36] realize that was just the high of the
[47:38] storm that had passed and while they
[47:41] went out looking and amen and and saying
[47:44] Oh I thought it would be more they
[47:46] didn't
[47:47] realize that something great was
[47:52] underway oh it wasn't when it passed the
[47:55] first first time that was a destruction
[47:59] it was a second time it
[48:01] strike and you know the next morning
[48:04] they were crying they said never again
[48:07] never again we would want to be a part
[48:11] of the storm yeah right brother brandham
[48:14] said there's an oncoming storm that's
[48:18] going to strike every man right every
[48:21] woman that is born in this world that's
[48:23] right and it seemed like some sometimes
[48:25] s when we are without experience we said
[48:29] give us the storm let us see the storm
[48:32] yeah but he said hallelujah amen as the
[48:35] Bible declare it is the
[48:37] foundation that the house is laid upon
[48:41] amen that's right I tell you this
[48:43] Brethren when we came first to the word
[48:46] of God we all came out of something
[48:48] right we all came from an experience we
[48:52] said we've got a frame of reference amen
[48:55] you you know I hear people testify am
[48:58] mean you know oh when I was filled with
[49:00] the Holy Ghost in Pentecost amen when I
[49:03] came out of this uh when I've been
[49:05] through this experience uh but we know
[49:08] that the true birth of this age uh has
[49:11] going to come by the message of the hour
[49:14] that's right amen that's right amen yes
[49:17] sir there is a true foundation right but
[49:21] yet there are many foundation and
[49:24] Brethren I tell you what
[49:26] we've got to amen the Bible said you've
[49:29] got to dig deep yeah until you strike
[49:33] Solid
[49:34] Rock because if you don't then when the
[49:38] storms come it's going to move your
[49:41] foundation out of the way you know heard
[49:44] years ago they said people who believe
[49:48] the message we've got an experience we
[49:51] know that whatsoever we do we must
[49:54] strike some Solid Rock we must make sure
[49:59] that we are built upon amen True
[50:02] Foundation amen not just to come by and
[50:05] said oh this is what I have right yeah
[50:09] I've seen an experience in my
[50:11] time I remember when I first came and
[50:14] started to preach the message in linston
[50:17] my yeah you know my hometown and you
[50:19] know people begin to take all of the
[50:21] message and and the books were going out
[50:24] and me people were getting
[50:26] I noticed that different ones are
[50:28] different experience from what they
[50:30] glean from the same message and I found
[50:34] one time there was a brother and friend
[50:36] of mine every every time he he takes a
[50:38] little message book uh you know he don't
[50:40] read the introduction he don't read the
[50:43] St he goes to the back of the book just
[50:46] right where the message ends and the
[50:49] pearline is going to start and that's
[50:51] the part he start to read from yeah
[50:54] because uh he his mind was
[50:57] captivated amen by this message of
[51:00] healing yeah right right and there are
[51:03] those who amen never take the
[51:05] preliminary but they they started from
[51:07] right where the scripture was read yeah
[51:10] because they want to read this portion
[51:14] yeah but then I I I I see a little more
[51:16] as I I go along you you take a book that
[51:20] somebody has read and and they've made
[51:22] their Mark in it yeah and you look at
[51:24] the thing things that amen they
[51:26] highlight and you know if you are like
[51:29] me you know when when I read something
[51:31] and something strike me I put a little
[51:34] Mark there right exactly amen sometimes
[51:37] we I light it and you know but and I
[51:40] find that you know you might read the
[51:42] same book but if I take what what I I
[51:46] like and might be what brother Wade I
[51:48] like we might ilight different things
[51:51] really amen amen and that is what stri
[51:55] thank you you know Brethren but listen
[51:58] it doesn't matter amen where the
[52:01] attraction comes from when we started
[52:04] out we all got to start from the same
[52:09] point are you there with me that we do
[52:12] not come to the message because we hear
[52:16] a voice of healing right it's not
[52:19] because we were told that there is a
[52:22] prophet in the land but Brethren we've
[52:24] all got a start the same point for by
[52:27] one Spirit are we all baptized into one
[52:32] body which is the body of Jesus Christ
[52:35] Brethren may I say to you you got to
[52:37] come in by
[52:40] birth hello
[52:42] somebody amen it doesn't matter what the
[52:46] attraction is we come into it by birth
[52:50] and so I might be attracted attracted to
[52:53] this for years and because of that uh
[52:56] I'm Associated around the message but
[52:59] there's got to be a day in your life
[53:02] where something struck
[53:05] you that's right you know I tell you I
[53:08] was a part of this message for years for
[53:11] a few years before it really struck me
[53:15] amen my my my
[53:18] initial uh attraction was and I I I I
[53:22] was a Baptist to to begin with I was
[53:25] never baptized but that is my Foundation
[53:28] I I went to the Baptist Church when I
[53:29] was a child and the first thing that
[53:32] struck me was might be amen the the the
[53:36] the Heralds of healing in our time yeah
[53:40] and so I begin to amen read more ofen
[53:44] this great phenomena that amen we don't
[53:46] talk about in a Baptist church yet we
[53:48] would have many times that we believe
[53:50] God Is A Healer but here now I was
[53:52] reading of of of events that happen
[53:55] right and it it struck me that there's
[53:57] got to be something about this and Bren
[54:00] I tell you the truth even when I was
[54:03] baptized into it uh it's not because uh
[54:07] amen that I realized that there was a
[54:09] message to take a bride out of a Rapture
[54:13] but I realized that baptism in Jesus
[54:16] name was right are you there with me and
[54:20] I was coming upon that premise but
[54:23] Brethren I never yet it the
[54:26] foundation and and I tell you what amen
[54:30] until amen I had that birth from the
[54:34] word amen hello somebody am then I
[54:38] realize amen this is not just something
[54:41] to let a people look different uh this
[54:43] is not just something to let you walk
[54:45] different uh but there is a message to
[54:49] take us behind the
[54:51] veil amen that's right amen
[54:56] Hallelujah because there's a coming
[54:59] storm hello somebody you know the the
[55:03] Peter said am me for all things continue
[55:06] as they were until the time of
[55:09] restitution and I believe that we are
[55:11] getting into the time of restitution of
[55:15] all things which he said Hallelujah the
[55:18] mouth of all the holy prophets speak of
[55:21] since the world begin and Brethren if
[55:24] there's a Time to be
[55:26] sure that time is now Glory right
[55:30] Hallelujah if we're ever going to be
[55:32] sure of where we're standing we've got
[55:35] to be certain now GL in the message of
[55:38] the oncoming storm he said Jesus was
[55:42] speaking here of a coming storm okay let
[55:45] me go to God keep his word yeah amen he
[55:49] said that's what we need today is
[55:52] preachers right and Men Who will say
[55:56] What God Says to be the
[55:58] truth exactly hello right we're talking
[56:02] about a true foundation right what we
[56:06] need is
[56:08] preachers and men who will say What God
[56:12] Says to be the truth amen amen no matter
[56:16] if it's a great organization that you're
[56:19] building upon right if it's not built
[56:22] upon the word of God right amen it will
[56:26] fall no matter what else you have it
[56:29] will fall if it's not on the word of God
[56:33] Amen you know Brethren I use a statement
[56:36] back home to the people I said you know
[56:38] we might say well I'm going to do this
[56:40] tomorrow and tomorrow I never get to do
[56:43] it right amen or I might have a good
[56:46] intention of of something that I I
[56:49] really want to do and from my heart I'm
[56:51] honestly I want to do it right but I
[56:55] never get around to it really but I said
[56:57] I want you to take God's word like this
[57:01] when God says something brother Bram
[57:04] said that God becomes guilty of his word
[57:07] until he brings it to pass that's right
[57:11] God don't just speak the way we speak
[57:14] but when God utter a word he pledge his
[57:19] word are you there with me so when God
[57:22] said in his word I send my word to you
[57:26] it's not a saying it's a
[57:31] pledge even and H can pass away but that
[57:35] word cannot pass and all God need is
[57:38] somebody to believe that hello that's
[57:41] right you know I remember years ago I
[57:44] was told that there was a sister amen
[57:47] and she was an old woman and you know
[57:49] she started to read the message when she
[57:51] was old and she was reading a message
[57:53] and she she found something something
[57:55] there something that said if you're born
[57:59] out of wedlock she she was interpreting
[58:02] you can't make it in yeah and she take
[58:05] that book and she was crippled in her
[58:08] bed and and she stuck it under her
[58:10] pillow and she laid there dying because
[58:13] she had something that she was holding
[58:16] on to right that I can't make
[58:20] it hello somebody right and she held on
[58:24] to that and her condition was getting
[58:28] worse and somebody said what's the
[58:30] problem she held that sacred in her
[58:32] heart yeah that I can't make it yeah oh
[58:37] Brethren right but then somebody said
[58:40] what's a problem oh she said but here
[58:43] this is what I found in there and I
[58:46] realized that there's no place for me
[58:49] yeah but then she was taken a little
[58:53] further right amen
[58:55] Hallelujah glory and when God speak he's
[58:59] not just saying it but he pled his word
[59:04] hallelujah what Joy she had to realize
[59:08] amen that God consider me glory amen

[59:43] came believing that that God said a
[59:45] prophet and oh I love the message amen I
[59:48] love amen the the the way the prophet
[59:51] did and the thing he said about hunting
[59:53] and so you know I I tell you this I mean

[1:33:39] it couldn't be any other way right
[1:33:41] that's God's way we just put it all in
[1:33:44] the hands of God Amen and the Bible said
[1:33:46] the footsteps of the righteous they are
[1:33:48] ordered by the Lord you've got to
[1:33:50] believe that
[1:33:52] right and there's some signs and
[1:33:54] flickers that you see sometime some
[1:33:56] shiny things of life that that's not
[1:33:58] God's way but if we keep trusting God he
[1:34:02] pledge his word he pledge his word what
[1:34:06] a mystery to you and I he pledge his
[1:34:08] word he's going to build upon this
[1:34:10] Foundation that's right amen hallelujah
[1:34:17] amen brother Brandon when you look at
[1:34:20] Isaac said Abram being a type of God as
[1:34:24] Isaac was offered Genesis 22 we find out
[1:34:28] that he carried the wood up the hill
[1:34:31] yeah and everything portrayed Christ
[1:34:35] right foreshadowed him Y and then the
[1:34:38] the ram came and was offered instead

[1:35:00] caught in the ticket for you God knows
[1:35:03] what he's doing keep pressing on
[1:35:06] Hallelujah now that's right that was
[1:35:09] Faith love and Jacob which means a
[1:35:12] planter and a receiver and we realize
[1:35:16] that Jacob's life really represent Grace
[1:35:20] amen Grace
[1:35:22] unmerited
[1:35:23] favor Hallelujah because it was a grace
[1:35:26] of God all the time with Jacob
[1:35:29] Hallelujah then comes Joseph right
[1:35:31] Hallelujah there's nothing against
[1:35:33] Joseph he was Perfection Hallelujah
[1:35:36] Without a Cause he was sold and in every
[1:35:40] way his life overshadow the life of
[1:35:43] Jesus Christ oh that's what he's
[1:35:45] bringing you and heart to Hallelujah
[1:35:48] Brethren I ask a question now now but
[1:35:52] what about my whole Foundation yeah you
[1:35:56] know sometimes around the message we've
[1:35:58] got to be careful we glorified all
[1:36:02] yesterday today that God has brought us
[1:36:05] to that's right amen but when we started
[1:36:08] out I never knew
[1:36:11] battles I I never knew heartache y I
[1:36:15] never know pain yeah
[1:36:18] Brethren the things that I've gone
[1:36:20] through
[1:36:22] and if you ask me maybe 22 years ago
[1:36:25] what are you expecting now that you've
[1:36:27] come to this word oh Hallelujah yeah
[1:36:32] it's going to be joy and speakable full
[1:36:35] of Glory yeah Brethren I didn't know
[1:36:39] you'd be ridicul right yeah I I I didn't
[1:36:43] know you'd be
[1:36:45] laughter I didn't know you you had to
[1:36:48] stand and fight for the very word
[1:36:51] that is spoken right that the people who
[1:36:54] say I believe the message I didn't know
[1:36:58] that I would have to fight for those SP
[1:37:00] of ground right I would know that I
[1:37:03] would sit there and listen and my heart
[1:37:06] bleed because all that try to bring the
[1:37:10] bride and P the bride in another picture
[1:37:13] right that is not the word of God right
[1:37:17] right oh Brethren I I did not know the
[1:37:20] man would speak without respect to the
[1:37:24] Bride of Jesus Christ the men would come
[1:37:27] beyond the old Pulpit never have the
[1:37:30] experience like Moses had I did not know
[1:37:34] it right okay Hallelujah but how we need
[1:37:37] to check back that Foundation amen
[1:37:39] that's right you know I find it's
[1:37:44] ironic and might be we have a situation
[1:37:47] that is unique of every other group that
[1:37:50] there is
[1:37:51] in the world
[1:37:53] yeah that we claim one message oh yeah
[1:37:57] right but yet we're so diverse right
[1:38:01] right amen we don't listen to each other
[1:38:03] right we we don't let them talk yeah
[1:38:06] yeah and finish their
[1:38:08] statement because every man's got
[1:38:10] another absolute right amen hello
[1:38:14] somebody oh Brethren how privileged we
[1:38:17] are to be that God pledge his word to
[1:38:20] right right hallelujah amen
[1:38:24] hallelujah oh I just take two more close
[1:38:27] you said that's why we have the trouble
[1:38:29] that's why you see professed Christians
[1:38:32] living today they're all right and
[1:38:35] tomorrow they're all wrong the next
[1:38:37] thing it's because they never tore the
[1:38:41] whole Foundation
[1:38:44] down we got a lot of Baptist that
[1:38:47] believe exactly lot of Pentecostal that
[1:38:50] believe
[1:38:52] hello right and people said oh but I
[1:38:55] came out of two Soul we've got a lot of
[1:38:57] Two Souls that
[1:38:59] believe in the only church that's what
[1:39:01] they had right but there come some
[1:39:05] Pharisees that believe but they're still
[1:39:08] old
[1:39:09] Pharisees right but they believe yeah
[1:39:12] yeah never tore the old Foundation
[1:39:16] down hello somebody right because they
[1:39:19] want to tell you oh you see but I knew
[1:39:23] this from way back then yeah oh Brethren
[1:39:26] I tell you what oh we need to meet to
[1:39:29] the fire of God yes sir Moses would have
[1:39:33] brought 40 Years of Herold but God said
[1:39:37] Moses take off your shoes yeah when when
[1:39:41] you come into my presence I don't want
[1:39:43] nothing between me and you brethen it
[1:39:46] was like an intimate right
[1:39:49] relationship God and man come together
[1:39:52] Moses was never the Moses the man the
[1:39:56] skin that he walking for 40 years meant
[1:40:00] nothing more to him that brief moment
[1:40:04] that he spent in the presence of
[1:40:07] almighty god brother BR said and
[1:40:10] everything that he had need
[1:40:12] of everything that moment in the
[1:40:16] presence of God he got everything right
[1:40:19] are you there with me oh no wonder what
[1:40:22] prophet said Hallelujah imagine he said
[1:40:25] and God gave me the authority back there
[1:40:27] upon the
[1:40:28] mountain exactly and in that day when he
[1:40:32] comes to you you will have the perfect
[1:40:37] word potentially as your spirit grow and
[1:40:40] mature as you feed upon the word of God
[1:40:44] Reverend don't fool yourself your
[1:40:46] Revelation is by the amount of word that
[1:40:48] you have received yes sir amen that's
[1:40:50] Cor
[1:40:52] hello amen the prophet of God and the
[1:40:55] church can get further than the pastor
[1:40:58] if he teach them the word of God right
[1:41:02] hello wonder the people are unstable
[1:41:05] that's right going to and from all the
[1:41:08] old Foundation right it's got to be torn
[1:41:12] down and when you find the truth
[1:41:15] everything that was before yeah
[1:41:17] everything that you had don't wonder are
[1:41:20] you people are confused cuz they look at
[1:41:23] your life and here you are but oh they
[1:41:26] see the symptoms of your yesterday and
[1:41:29] you never say I was wrong right good
[1:41:33] brother oh what should they believe amen

[1:41:39] before I was wrong but thank God for the
[1:41:42] truth hello will right all
[1:41:48] along no I have had another Foundation
[1:41:52] that was not the word of God and by the
[1:41:55] grace of God he took me out of that
[1:41:59] Hallelujah and I broke down that old
[1:42:03] Foundation oh Simon Peter I preaching in
[1:42:06] deceiving he said and like newborn babes
[1:42:11] desirous oh but we're being in the
[1:42:13] message we're see brother Bram in person
[1:42:16] that has nothing to do with
[1:42:18] it that's right exactly amen you could
[1:42:21] have been to aund services with a pro
[1:42:23] that had nothing to do with it because
[1:42:26] right there potentially was laid but it
[1:42:30] wasn't open to them they didn't know
[1:42:32] what they were hearing oh Hallelujah
[1:42:36] even those who came in the presence of
[1:42:39] almighty God right brother brand had to
