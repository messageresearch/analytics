was one there's one I ran off on the um there's one quote I ran off on the uh computer in the back and it's back there in the office you'll get it for me but I found the quote I was going to tell you about where we're where we're missing it at I want to read it thank you brother but let's bow our heads before we get started I know we all have unspoken requests we all have prayers in our hearts that we want to uh to go before the Lord and and just pray that God will help me this afternoon de Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you'd come again among us Lord and not be someone that stands over to the side Lord but be an active participant in the service Lord be the one that breaks the word to each one of us father be the one that comes down and Sparks that little life of holy spirit that we have in US Lord that'll hear your word father and not only hear it but Lord would respond to it you said you you said you would would not U you know your word wouldn't come back void but it would accomplish what he said father we pray that you just be with us now take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit bless the on that are sick bless the ones that are not with us Lord that you take care of each one Lord just forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes Lord help us through this Walk of Life help us to help someone else Lord help us to be a Shining Light Lord for you we ask your blessings all these things in Jesus name amen amen 1 Corinthian I mean 1 Peter 3: 1-7 likewise you wives be in subjection to your own husbands now we're going to get into that a little bit this afternoon then if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives why because the wives is where you can see it at you physically can see it from the wives us I mean I look like a regular guy you know of course people this day and time have tattoos all the way up their arms and earrings in their ears and you know you know weird junk like that but um but we are a little we are supposed to be different in our mannerism but the wife really shows it a Pure Clean woman I mean my what a what a testimony and see without even reading the word of God when they walk by yeah without even reading the word without the word be one by the conversation of the wise while they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be of the outward adorning of platting of hair and of wearing of gold and putting on of apparel Let It Be The Hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit who is in the sight of God of great price for after this man in the old times the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husband even as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters you are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge we going to get into that today a little bit excuse me giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered you may be seated the Lord and his BL lessons to the reading the word we're going to read that quote and I really actually forgot that I think they pulled it up on the U computer if you would pull that first one up brother Anderson said he was just going to scroll them he wasn't going to he was just going to scroll them and let me keep reading so Anderson got big old fingers back there he got long fingers and he can reach and get that button cuz you got to realize every time I say something and every time I want a quote to pop up they got to get it on the computer and they've got to hit this thing right here make it come up on the screen then they have to scroll it with their other hand to uh to get it to where we can read it so it's not just sitting back there pushing buttons you know they're they're at it pretty uh you know pretty well they're kind of the captain of the ship that you don't see you know they're actually running the show I just give them the information and they put it up on the screen look at adoption each the lamb was provided and divied up by inspiration and each one I can take the scriptures and show it to you exactly that he put them in the place where they were supposed to be now what's he talking about the positionally placing of the Israelites in the what land of Canaan all right positionally how the 2 and A2 tribes stayed across the river how their mothers cried in their birth and how that each place was supposed to be and now after you are in what is the promised land type of baptism of the Holy Ghost right all right and after you're in that don't mean that you're out free from war everybody read that you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on so see Canaan did did not represent the great Heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings and so forth but it did represent this that it must be a perfect walk right and there's where the church is failing today on that walk not that we don't know everything not that we don't have all the knowledge we've got all the tapes we've got all the books there's not any hidden secrets there's no Hidden Mysteries where the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out and get it healed you're Miss behavior of unconfessed Sins Of You Believers didn't say unbelievers did it Believers am can cause this church to bitterly fail and at the day of the Judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it oh you say now wait a minute brother Brenham well that's the truth think of it and he's talking about Joshua remember Joshua how about an army that went across fought the Hittites and the amorites and they didn't even need a scratch they didn't need a nurse or first aid or Band-Aid they didn't even need a Red Cross they lost nobody in the battle and it was hand to hand combat it wasn't shooting somebody from 400 yard away it was hand toand combat but God told him if you'll do what I say you'll never lose a battle amen you'll never lose a man right then what happened when aching come in and sin came in Camp what happened automatically what was it 20 people or something like that automatically killed Joshua knew there was a problem somewhere he called an assembly we going find out what this problem is all right so maybe we ought to do that a little more often we're not trying to get rid of people we're trying to get rid of problems right right same way this is what I'm doing with this trying to get rid of problems trying to trying to look you know look for the train wreck that's coming right get rid of the train you know get the trains on the right track so they don't run into each other all right so now we're talking here yeah this is it but where we had the double Covenant everybody understand we had one Covenant Y Man and female male and female co-equal now we've come to where Eve did what she did Adam Adam wasn't out here so holy and Pi he took him her sin right all right but God then put him under a covenant and said hey you because you're the weaker vessel because you look at the emotional side you look at the you know things like that and and you're different from the man and this is what happened through you right here's what's going we're going to do now notice after the beginning after the beginning the time again back in that was eternity is over now eternity is not over but he was talking about the eternity is over as far as we are concerned cuz we have to drop down into time all right notice after that fall was made by Eve after the fall there would need to be another covenant made now this is going to stumble you but I'm going to give you scripture to prove that is the truth now notice after the fall Jesus said God at the beginning made one of a kind but now after the fall now we're going beyond that the Covenant was co-equal but now after the fall there's another Covenant made now she is no longer ruler with him each must have a separate Covenant we were talking outside brother Collins and and dad were talking your sisters you think that we beat on the women and and all but you're a type of us right you're a type of Christ in the church right right that's right so we look at brother rown said what look at the women you'll see how the religious world's acting right all right so you have a standard that you you can hold yourself I mean you don't have to preach you don't have we you don't have to give an account for our stupidity right but we got to give an account for what you do right sisters ought to say praise the Lord that's right thank you but remember if you stay in your position that's where God needs you to be that's where you ought to be and that's where God saw you you needed to be and made that position for you amen amen God made that position for you okay remember brother Benny and sister Brenda they're traveling on their way to Savannah I just saw them missing over here and uh just remember them as they travel they're going to take a little vacation time which is not bad at all take a vacation all right now First Corinthians I don't mind this scrolling part I told him I said I'll just start reading and you just keep scrolling 1 Corinthians 11:3 but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God so there's your order we saw that last time when we were talking about this now let's go to 14 a but now look I'm going to read this again just to leave that right there but I want you to know that but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ now when we give oursel over to Christ what do we do we take on the name of Jesus Christ amen all right so we've lost our name we're not actually actually June June Thomas doesn't exist anymore right she doesn't right it's nowhere on the record that she exist oh sure back when she was born but I'm talking about after she married me she and I it's June Dale right right there's no other June Thomas anywhere that hadn't come back up that's dead it's gone right cuz remember like Dad said you you got to if you're still married to somebody else and try to be married to Christ you're an adultery yeah so your old name your old husband your old Nature's got to be dead right right dead but you see first decisions made next engagement then promise right and then the ceremony and that's when the bride takes the bridegroom's name she is no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name all right 14b and I'm like that I want to make make it clear that I will not ever do a marriage ceremony if the girl wants to keep her made name cuz that means that she's not submitted herself right right to the husband all is't that right right that's the whole thing you're not submitting your whole self you're doing what daddy said you're taking some of the old you and just sticking it over here in the closet so I can reach over here and get it when I need it that's right but if the old me broy is dead or the old June Thomas is dead there's no more June Thomas anymore she's not even known as Jim Thomas she's Jim d right she's never more nobody ever called her Jim Thomas even her family they know she married me she took on my name all right and you know what she can have my protection because she's took on my name right you're not protected if you don't have your husband's name right are you protected in Christ if you don't have his name I don't think so so you got the only protection that your wife has I say the only when it comes to certain things is that she submitted her name to you giving up that part of her life married to you now you know what men you know what you've done women you've said here you're responsible for me yeah right if you fully given everything vows and everything you fully given yourself to your husband you're saying here right that's right you're taking care of me now right amen you're my protection right but if you're not you're not protected right then another thing after she was taking all those vows and so forth and the ceremony has been said like my wife's name was Bry before she was married now she is no longer a br she is brandom now she isn't no more Bry she is brandom same thing when you come into Christ you're no more of the world you're of Christ you care not for the things of the world that's what we're supposed to be that's one our problem is like we read there it's in our walk the things that we do in life we got to get away from these things don't try to live on the border get away from them same way with even looking for a for a spouse or even or even continuing on in the marriage that you're in we've still got to look at these things and say hey I don't want to be right on the line I want to be so far away from the line so the line I can't even see the line right all right I want to be away from that I don't know why in the world we want to keep playing around and you know what I thought the other day and I'm just going to say it uh Daddy's preached y'all for 40 years and you hadn't listened to him I wondered why y'all listen didn't listen to some of the things I said cuz some of you women still run your husbands around some of you people say things you shouldn't say and all that and I thought well if I hadn't done it for him in 40 years why you think he going to do it for me in about 10 so sorry that's just the way it is but some will and some won't we're not all made to be to where we can change and I'm sorry for that but you know what brother Bram said we're sitting I told him up in in Tennessee brother Bram said you're sitting on top of a razor right remember he said that you're sitting on top of a razor blade every doesn't matter how thin that razor blade is it's made like this right yeah and you're sitting right on top of it he said if you go off one side or the other he said there's absolutely no way to get back because if you start off this way you're going to just keep going right right once you get off once you fall and go down the only way is you got to come back and get back up on the edge again and that's where it what cuts that's the problem with us and that's a problem with most of us is we don't like change and we don't want to change but you know what if you don't change then you just go to an early grave Fellowship this was a purpose for marriage let's look at this for just a second Bob wake up scroll scroll brother Fellowship pray or marriage have to wake them up up after I bragged on y'all look what you did Fellowship the is the for was the first purpose of marriage now brother BR said in choosing of a bride when God gave him man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of salvation but when one goes to try to take a man's place then she's about the worst thing he could get a hold of right now see we can see that we can see the spiritual application all right so let's go to the next one let's go to uh this note I want you to see this note God had to separate him in flesh that's what he had to do had to separate Adam and Eve now I'm taking some I'm paraphrasing some of the things that brother Bram said and kind of put them together I hope you don't mind but it kind of keeps from having to read the whole quote God had to separate them in flesh in order to join them together in the fellowship of marriage in other words Adam and Eve couldn't produce Adam while Eve was still inside of Adam right Eve had to come out of Adam there had to be a separation before there could be Fellowship all right Adam and Eve were not made to be two separate individuals with each pursuing their own individual life they weren't rather they were two individuals placed in a relationship as one flesh to fellowship with each other and with God that was the intention and that's what we're getting back to all right we come down here to be individuals and do the things that we do as individuals but now up there we're going to be individuals we know that but the fellowship part was was for us to Fellowship back to God right that's the part we got to Fellowship back to God God wants our fellowship as a married couple as well as with us as individuals all right keep going Genesis 2:18 God gave us a want to help meet remember we went back and give you the definition which is one suitable for him one to meet that's why it says help meet not mate help meet one to meet his need for Fellowship right that's what we're talking about downstairs and we kind of laugh about it but you know if Jun said she could do without me if I passed away but I couldn't do without her I don't think I'd have to have Fellowship I'm sorry I'm you know but what are you doing it's that call it's that call in your in your in your human life that you need fellowship with somebody but I will make him and help me for him God said it is not good for the man to be alone in other words he don't want that to happen I will make him a help me all right let's keep going but now remember this is where the Fellowship was broken when when God comes to Adam and said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was what afraid to me that's a very striking thing because the fellowship was broke by fear Adam had no problem speaking to God before this he had no problem walking right straight up to God and fellowshipping with God had nothing in his mind that was wrong but now when this happened first thing he said I heard you calling me and I was afraid all right in other words I was I had fear all right and what what does Fear do let's keep going brother afraid why he walked among the Beast Etc but because of Sin unconfessed Sin breaks Fellowship right he didn't confess right Adam never confessed to God and said I'm sorry right he said it was a woman you gave me right all right but what did fear bring jealousy Pride doubt anxiety and worry that's the problem with all of us we've got all these things in there of fear right but why did Jesus always say fear not when he appeared he's bringing us right back to the fellowship that Jesus I'm going to say Jesus Jesus didn't have to say to Adam and Eve fear not right no he just come down in the cool of the day Adam and Eve walked up there and met him and they just just like me and Dad was set in fellowship with each other but when something came in between them Adam says I was afraid what I was afraid of what God was going to do to me right so I just went and put some clothes on or I just went and you know did this or or you know I went in bushes and started having church but why did Jesus always say fear not when he appeared cuz he wanted to reestablish that he was the second Adam right but he wanted to reestablish the fellowship that the first Adam and Eve had with God so establish Fellowship between you and your mate that's the same thing here on Earth praying together stops a lot of arguments yeah communicate with each other financially don't do it by text or email but financially or any of those you can use but communicate with your spouse communicate with your spouse yeah I mean that's just what hurts more sisters the silent treatment or just go ahead and talking the silent treatment huh the silent treatment yeah that hurts worse than anything the silent treatment just talk about it I mean that's your that's your bone your bone and flesh your flesh talk about it relationship now watch what is the first like the water of Separation the first is the first course the kitchen where you come and eat you feed in the kitchen when you come to church and you feed on the word oh don't you love the word feeding on the word that's the first place then in the next place you enter into kind of a relationship of this type that you embrace your wife you stand there maybe in the Parlor and she's taking off her bail and you put your arm around her you tell her you love her and that she's going to be the most darling wife in all the world and how that you love her and how you going to be loyal to your your marriage Val and so forth you've done had your little Feast the wedding feast and now you entered into tell her in the Parlor you set her down in a chair set her on your lap and tell her you're ready to enter into real Fellowship excuse me for this rude expression but that's not complete yet Fellowship complete only can come through relationship and the only way you can completely fellowship with your wife as your wife she's never become a complete Fellowship to you until she has abide in relationship that's the bedroom that's where New Life Begins now we understand that that that is true in the justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost right where we come into relationship with God but he wants husband and wife to have a good time with each other he wants you to enjoy each other uh there's nothing wrong with that you know the scripture always says that that uh about the U marriage is Honorable and the bad undefined have fun with your spouse have fun with you that's what you put here for do it in a Godly manner though let's go to the next one Genesis 1 he gave us the ability to multiply but not by sex the first part this part and God blessed him and God said un them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it he give that to them that's what he expects right them and have dominion over the Fisher Sea and the of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth so he gave it to them he blessed them and said unto them not just Adam he he said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it all right Hebrews 13:4 marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled but wh mongers and adulterers God will judge so we need to make sure we stay in our clean living correct Ecclesiastes listen live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy life of thy vanity which he ha given thee under the son all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and thy labor which thou takest Under the Sun what to live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of your life I love to see a a couple just really love each other nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband ship now we went over these and we'll just kind of cover them real quick for those of you that forgot but this is fellowship and relationship based on love not just lust and all the other things of the world cuz you got your double Covenant actually the double Covenant you say well that makes the woman down here and the man up here well if you look at it right it restores the order to where that we got to live in down here right we have to live in that order Christ is our head always right Christ is always going to be our head it didn't matter if we didn't have a fall right but the double Covenant restores the order of headship and fellowship it's giving us a way back to the coequal of joint airs yeah cuz what does it say in 1 Peter 3 we read it that they may be join airs with the grace of life or co-equal all right if men would act like men and women act like women will be able to have fellowship and relationship with each other and with the Lord Jesus Jesus bringing together for Fellowship based on love then we showed what the four loves were a goly love which is the love of God Divine love perfect love or the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right A lot of people wants to know what perfect love is brother B said everybody that went across a curtain of time and that sixth Dimension had what perfect love right so guess what if they were in the sixth Dimension and they were over there all together they had to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be in that Dimension so perfect love is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen people fought over that and questioned it and everything else what did what does perfect love mean well it means you got the Holy Ghost amen simple am now filal love is a love for your spouse OS is sexual love sensual lust or lust sensual love or lust and storage is a love between family parents and children now remember what we said the true the true will of God was for us to have a gothy love amen right right cuz Adam had the Holy Ghost Eve had the Holy Ghost right right they had eternal life in their soul amen right they have eternal life in their soul that's ay love that wasn't filal love right but when what happened in the garden what Satan done he took that highest form of love and he started doing what he always does is dilute it break it down and make it into something that he wanted it to be and God said okay I'll allow fil your love because that's a love for the spouse show a love right heos which is sexual love and he brings all that in we got to have that so we can procreate down here and then we do have love for our family which is app parent to a child you wouldn't have any of these other loves for a child but you see how though in the end time you look how Satan's took every bit of that and just rolled it all together you see all these men with these children having these loot acts and all stuff my Lord Brother brand thought it was almost insane I think we're past insane in 2012 all this junk going on in schools and all that we ought to know it's the end time right amen cuz Sodom and Gomorrah Sodom and Gomorrah I don't know if it was this bad I don't think it was this bad in a worldly SC in a world wide scale Sodom and gomorra was that way in two cities of the world and God destroyed those two cities but who was it I don't know it was brother Brandon but somebody said if he didn't destroy this country or this world he'd have to raise up Sodom and gomorra and apologize for doing that because that was just two cities this is the our whole world is perverted but what is go what is he doing though Satan's took out agapy love the love of God and he's perverted it down right but now what we're doing is we're taking and we're rolling it back up to that agap love right right which is the love of God because that's what uh I don't think I put it in here yeah I did 1 Corinthians 13 let's go to the next one and we'll read what the Bible said about it notice the Great Masterpiece of the family husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they are one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way and husband another that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family and now that was God's Masterpiece and now all the true family here portrays that see and now the Masterpiece family has come again Christ and his bride ready to come the second Adam second Eve ready now to return back to their home and the whole picture has been what Redemption amen from where it was bringing it back see just exactly bringing it back again cuz what is redemption it's restoring back what fell right the fellowship that fell with god with man and woman being coequal that's what we're going back to or we didn't fall from that to start with but we did fall from that and that's what we got to get back to uh this gospel is really a simple go simple gospel if you'll listen number 18 love should govern the home love is the greatest force that was ever put in the power of a man of man a home that's not disciplined by love is not much of a home if the husband and wife doesn't solemnly love each other they can they cannot trust each other and going down to the bottom now love is in two different words two different meanings in the Greek one of them is called filio that's the love that you have for your wife Agy love is the love divine love now the love that you have for your wife and the love of God Is So contrary see what Satan's done he's made it so contrary just listen to this the love that you have for your wife if a man would insult her you'd kill him on the spot with that kind of love fil your love but with a go of Love you'd pray for his lost soul that'd be the difference there's two different types of love and I'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived with having filal love and thinking it's a love see that's what's happening to the the uh people in the end time that the anointed one KN ones at the end time they feel that agape love they feel it on them right but it's nothing more than filal love it's just love of just coming and being around people and but Agy love is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that puts you into the body all right so that's what we got to have folks let's go have F Your Love F your love is intellectual right Agy love comes from the heart that's human love affectionate love and godly love Godly love doesn't question human love reasons but Godly love doesn't it's perfect in its trust it's perfect it just produces faith when you really love amen all right let's go to the next one kinsman redeemer I like this one him and his wife were talking laying in the bed talking children didn't have to go to school they got talking about different things how many of you do that I didn't think so no nobody raise your hand remember I remember one time brother Brown was talking remember he said he was preaching to Mee and said she he looked over and she was asleep yeah well I guess I wasn't he said something I guess I wasn't impressing her or something like that you know but a prophet youd think a prophet preaching but they were human you know so same way with you and I I said hatred had a beginning so it has to have an end love had no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin and it never will end see it's Eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds a man that she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory am they all death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity they step down into space of time and return back to Eternity eternity has dropped in a body called time then it goes right back into eternity again it cannot perish now listen if you read that you look more like it you were back in eternity married to your mate well in God's mind you were yeah if she's born again and you're born again you're both going to heaven you both were in the mind of God right you both were you both were God saw you but you Ste down into space of time time and will return back to Eternity yeah because Adam and Eve were same here they're going to be the same when they get the glory it's not going to be Adam and 14 other people it's going to be Adam and Eve right same thing with you and I you know brother Bram told about him and Med and hope there's not any problem with that there right but God has listen this is my thoughts on this we could have stayed and been Eternal and and what would we have done but we come down here and God by Miracles put us together y lot of us by Miracles he put us together right and we had children and those children grew up and became preachers and put souls in glory right right how much more better would that be than it would be just to say well we were in eternity and we stayed in eternity and we were Eternal people no he said death nor nothing else can separate them they're an eternal maid in glory because they are from eternity what the eternal life they had was from eternity right right and they steep down into space of time and will return back to Eternity am cuz you're going back to that Eternal that always was right so don't get in your mind that you were married Soul mated back over here somewhere but actually in the mind of God if you're born again and she's born again you were with that Soul right back in eternity and God knew that you'd come down here and be be U uh you know you take Mom I mean dad's mom and and Dad's mother and father here he was 60 something years old here she was 42 going through the chains and then Here Comes him right well out of him comes here right without that it wouldn't have been any of this right you say how do you know well how do you not know right eternity has dropped down in the body called time then it goes right back up into eternity again it cannot perish right all right let's go to keep trolling 1 Corinthians 13:4 charity which is what love love suffereth long and is kind I want youall to listen to this because this is all about love this is the love of God and supposed to be in our heart toward each other charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity bth not itself other words it doesn't raise itself up to here yeah it's not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own and is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things this is charity and you take that charity and you bring it down though to F your love between you and your spouse that's where we should be living yeah right that's where we should be living you say well that's between me and God you're not married to God as far as that's concerned you're married down here to your wife let's talk about that okay cuz if we don't get this thing the primer thing's right we're not going to get the the love of God I don't think like brother R said a person can't be an unbeliever and a Believer be together and have Harmony like it's talking about here you just can't do that I'm sorry I didn't make the rules but God said you just can't be unequally yolked and have this but if you have charity let's go a little bit further you that are that are sitting here without your spouse if you have that charity yeah you have that charity that's like the little woman that cleaned up after her husband supposedly drunk kicked everything down in the floor and said clean it up and she's cleaning up must Jesus bear the cross alone what' she do her love suffereth long that wasn't the feeling of Love cuz she could have probably inside of herself she wanted to kill him let's just be human about it truthful yeah she probably thought some things in her mind but what took over the love of God took over and said must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free that was her charity that she showed but that charity that she showed went over and got that man yeah and his buddy M and brought him to the Lord amen amen amen come on sisters he didn't get they didn't get it from a pull pit preaching they got it from a life live right but it was the word of God living right through that sister right showing charity charity suffereth long and His Kind charity envieth not bth not bless God I'm a Christian and you're not no no just but you got to be different you got to be different you got to let them see that it's different that you're different all right let's go to the next one 1 John 4:18 God is restoring True Fellowship there's no fear in love what do we talk about Adam first thing Adam said I was afraid yeah now 1 John 4:18 is telling us right here there's no fear and love right but perfect love the baptism of the Holy Ghost castest out fear because fear hath torment right we were talking downstairs that's what's the problem with remembering our previous life yeah that's the torment part what kids that's what we're trying to keep you away from from making the mistakes that we made right where you don't have to sit down and and every time you drive down the street and you live this neighborhood all your life and and you know just for an example say you've had a relationship with this woman and that woman and that guy well every time you drive by if you still live there guess what the devil's going to say you remember when yeah go somewhere at Walmart and meet an old girlfriend from a long time ago remember when remember what you did yeah but there's no fear in that kind of love right right you have perfect love that cast out all that fear right you put it right back on the devil and say look that was not me that did that the one you're talking to now is not the one you were talking to back then right and you know what resist the devil and he'll flee from you amen he that fearth is not made perfect in love right he that fearth if you have fear you're not made perfect in love all right now let's go to number 20 about the only religion and salvation we have and love is amongst the real godly people you know the Bible said that would happen congregation said amen uh-huh you Bible readers I heard you holler amen and you preachers back there that that's right the love would be so far away in the last days the only love that would be left would be between the elect of God's people the father would be against mother the mother against father children against parents and different ones against each other and the only love that will be left will be just be that elect just the elected the word elect here comes from the word elected God's elected people all right you Bible readers the love would be so far away in the last days the only love would be left would be between the elect of God's people why cuz we have the Pinnacle of love we have a gothly love if you're born again so we're the only ones that know how to love everybody else is down here and those other three filo ER off stores they're just sitting down here just slopping around like brother Brown said dog eat dog this world don't care about marriage and divorce that's what I was telling you this morning they don't care tell me they care they don't care about me Mar and divorce and what what the Bible said about it is brother said misinterpret the theology is what god well what is that some preacher telling them it's okay yeah some preacher saying this and some preacher saying that but that's why I said only the elect only the Born Again people needed the grace right we're the only ones that needed the grace of marriage and divorce they don't need it they're just ding dogs slopping around they if they get born again then they'll need it right but they don't get born again they're lost anyway right so I said don't cast your pearls before slne people don't and I'm not saying don't waste your time no witness to them right amen tell them how Jesus saved your soul right amen and then do one more important thing show them that you change right no just lip service show it to them you show it to them and I'll guarantee you they'll come or they're not predestinated to it anyway amen all right one of the two all right right now let's go to the next one remember we talked about motive and objective and the threedimensional love which is Body Spirit and soul and then true love requires all three of those part right yep because now if you're not born again you're only you're only truly married in your body and spirit you're not you're not soul to soul brother Brown remember he it's body to body Spirit to Spirit soul to soul you're not soul to soul no if you're not born again all right now let's go to the note just keep scrolling on through in marriage there must be the same kind of love and unity in Body Spirit and soul that's why God took woman out of man so they could truly be one in marriage see you can't leave The woman Inside the Man the woman's got to come out for Fellowship amen all right and like brother um Colin said downstairs where did he take her out of right there at his heart right there at the rib right there at the heart of of of man and then indeed they were one being in the beginning man is commanded to love his wife as his own body and indeed they were one being in the beginning the only way that a husband can truly love his wife as his own body as if they have that three-dimensional love cuz you can't have it without threedimensional love you can't have you know you can say well we're body to body that's just lust that's just Eros that's just you know that's just having relationship we're talking about relationship and fellowship right once again again what is important here is that unless a man and woman are truly one in Christ they can never have the kind of true love and fellowship that God intends now that would be self-explanatory if one's God and one's a devil they ain't no Fellowship there right and listen if we're if we're not born again we're of the devil sorry right right if we're not born again we're of the devil they may have a unity in body and spirit in other words like things or get along with each other hey I've known people especially around our our community that been married 60 years probably never went to church a day in their life but they just got to know each other in body and spirit but now if they're not born again they're just going to go away right right they just lived here for no other purpose but just to be here they may have a unity in body and spirit but without a born again experience you can never have the unity in your soul right amen all right now let's go to Ephesians 5 so ought men to love their wives that their own B he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother here we go again this is just like it was back in the beginning and shall be joined into his wife and they two shall be one flesh right all right let's go to the next worldly marriages are established only as one or two dimensional relationship in a one-dimensional union their love may only be a physical attraction lust or romance a two-dimensional Union includes their Spirit the second realm they now have a friendship common interest and all that but only in a Christian marriage does all three dimensions come into view giving them a fulfilling relationship that's why you should never marry an unbeliever or never date an unbeliever thinking you're to get him to come to church or get him or her to do something just try to cut through that try to get out of all that and cut straight to uh like I said this morning you're going to have enough problems as it is much less being born again I mean not born again and trying to live a a life you know you just you just can't do it it'd be hard it's hard enough living two Christians living together all right let's go to 21 how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's in filio now how about in ag goet to God how can it be if you don't love God if you said you're love your wife and never tell her about it never sit down and make love to her express it to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know and how pretty she is y'all need that you know you need that I really you do you guys need to tell you wife that I don't care if she Burns water tell her at least it's still water I mean at least it's water so I've never really seen burnt water I don't know where that comes from but Scorch you know you scorch things but uh but yeah just tell she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it that's the way we do to God when we love him we tell him about it we sit down and we adore him and worship him and see love drives us to that you will do it if you really love the person all right let's go to the next one questions and answers the Bible said not let one dirty conversation come among you when you profess Holiness treat that little lady like she's your sweetheart if she's 60 years old you be just the same amen you be that Gallant boyfriend and remember you are you don't try none of those new things and I know that what I'm talking about you just be a husband a genuine brother a genuine Christian I know that sounds but the you're my kids I got a right to say what I want to to you you see you're my kids you live right and you women live the right way to your husband and you husbands live the right way to to to your wives be real real nice and respect one another this is the prophet telling us how to live be real real nice and respect one another just to and your family relations and so forth like that let it be just as Reverend ly and godly and agreed with among you in everything as you can don't never push shov and be dirty and vulgar all right keep going understand talk to your wife if one nature is to you and another nature to her talk it with her talk it with her yes you you try to do the same thing to him sister and the same way understand one another and be real Christian gentlemen and real Christian ladies and brother and sister with one another always remember you're God's children and you're from a royal family amen you're a royal blood and there's no better blood in the world than yours and that's right and a royal blood shows itself that's what it is it's Royal all believe that say Amen yes sir show what you are I'm the I'm a son of a king I'm the son of a king my wife's a daughter of a king how would I treat that King's Daughter how would she treat that King's son see what I mean be real genuine I like that one all right go to the next one time tested memorials and was talking about men losing their affections for their wives and don't love them as they did when they were sweethearts shame on you you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that little honeymoon cease cuz it isn't going to in heaven yeah it's going to be just perfectly one there you know let stop just a second because you know I enjoy life and you know I do and June and I enjoy each other and you enjoy you know living the way you live and and you understand what I'm talking about but you think man I hope that doesn't go away but you got to remember brother Bram said this love that we have down here this filal love that we have for our wife that we would kill somebody take that love and he said times millions and that's what a gothe love is we think we don't want to lose that love between uh you know I thought about that one day you know Jun and I love each other very much totally and I don't want to lose that I don't want to lose that joy that feeling and then God showed me that quote where brother Brown said take whatever that is that you've got for your spouse your wife or husband take that times Millions times Millions yeah and that's what you'll have for her when you get over there amen you say man okay well this is just a spot then we're going to enjoy it and that's what he says right here oh never let that little honeymoon see cuz it isn't going to in heaven it's going to be just perfectly one there that's right looks like some women ought to Said Amen to that don't it you never let her let me hear you're always balling women out and talking like sister heckerson why didn't you say something or or somebody back there say did you thank you sister Cox that's very good brother Cox that's for you everywhere you are all right yes sir and we should never forget to honor each other always be sweetheart never let it cease all right all right let's go to the 24 oh for the grace of God that he would give us understanding of such great Mysteries as Paul spoke here further down in Ephesians speaking of the husband and wife this is the mystery how the women should be in respect to their husband even the second place I believe it is the entire Bible that reverence was ever spoke to said the woman seeing she reverence her husband reverence her husband then a husband ought to live such a life before his wife here's where Abraham and Sarah comes in act like a lord and she'll call you Lord guys gentlemen brothers act the life then a husband excuse me ought to live such a life before his wife that his wife could reverence him as a Son of God and if he doesn't live that kind of life well then of course she wouldn't reverence him cuz she knows what he's made of but when it is a man that is a reverent man reverent and clean with his wife and before his family a real servant of God then the women children and all should respect that servant of God Amen with reverence is that right amen right amen I don't know if we going to have time to do all this or not can we do anything tonight yeah can we you ain't got anything pressing all right well let's skip cuz we'll go back to the role of the man cuz I want to get to the last one you're going to have to skip through there brother go to keep scrolling to the role of the family that's after quote number 40 three and you notice we were only on quote 25 we can understand all that keep going down to where the roll of the family we'll get into that that's what I like about this you can go forward and backwards go to 43 go back back keep going back go to gen where it says Genesis 1:26 27 working it there it is right there let's get into this one and then we'll do the we'll do the uh role of the husband and the wife Wednesday if that's all right with y'all amen all right am because I want to get we got more family here on on the weekends than we do shameful to say sorry but I L A lot of you live away and that but that's okay but we really want I want to get this with all the kids here and all the parents here so you don't have to maybe you don't have to find it and listen to it Genesis 1 now we're going to shift from Marriage we're going to do the roll of the male and the roll of the female Wednesday now we're going to get to the family cuz I didn't cover all this the last time and God said let us make man in our own own image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in His image and the image of God created to him male and female created he them so the role of the family is to have a male and a female right not a male and a male or a female and a female like this world got it messed up but male and female created he them for what Genesis 9:1 this is before the fall now let's scroll down to just keep scrolling we're okay and God blessed Noah now this is after the fall and after the flood and God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth all right first thing coming out he telling look multiply and replenish the Earth Genesis 2:23 and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother here we go again and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh all right then Genesis 3:16 here's where we were talking about where the double Covenant came in but what's what he tells the woman to do unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children sisters were put on the earth to do what bring forth children all right and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now we'll get into that later on with the role of the male and the female but in the family that's what's wrong with the family now is the family unit now brother Brown there many quotes he said about that about the family unit Satan knew that if he could get to that family unit what did he do over there before the flood he took the daughters of man sons of God put them together what did he do he brother say he diluted the family yeah he got in there and took unbelievers and married them to Believers and then got he that's the same thing he was doing but God told him said You shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over the right now in interpreting that God is telling us that the man has a position the woman has a position your desire sisters is to your husband not three other husbands or other boyfriend to your husband husband you are same to the wife and he shall rule over thee with Godly love not with a rule of iron or a rule of of hardness but you'll rule over her and she won't have to give an account for you but you got to give an account of what she's doing all right do you guys remember that I I don't think that sinks in too far your wife walks out in the street with her clothes all cleaning to her and her and her breast showing and her rear end and everything and got on spikes about that high what does you do when you got spikes on about that high brothers and sisters this goes this way and that goes that way right yeah m is that comfortable no it's to show yourself period right the devil it's a devil it's not you it's a devil it's not comfortable read what brother Brown says about these things but if she makes a guy lust after her sure she's going to have to give an account but you got to give an account for what she did what she put on this is serious business people this is not just something where old brother Wade's going to try to tell us how to run our life I'm not telling you how to run your life I'm doing my best to tell you the prophet showed you how to run your life and the Bible showed you how to run your life you just don't listen to it no more you listen to me and brother d amen sorry but it's the truth get on that other side of that wedge and the only way to get back is to come back to the truth amen if not you're just going to keep getting worse and worse and worse right I I didn't make these things that the prophet told us amen but here let's listen 43a impersonation of Christianity what brought you in the first place thust Thou Art sin crept in and we had to go well we're still God will never be defeated he expected this Earth to be inhabited so he just made woman to bring children he still pours the calcium and potash and the elements into them and builds them up then he brings them to a place and let you make a choice and if without a choice God made me one day a young man strong and healthy and happy and the Holy Ghost not some cold formal theological theological Theological Seminary Dogma but the Blessed Holy Spirit not the tree of knowledge but the Holy Spirit you see it's God's program began to woo over me and make love to me and I accepted him and then he came down into my heart and took his place what he saying is that's what's happening back up here God will never be defeated he put woman to bring children but he's still the one put the thing together what happens millions of germs millions of eggs how does one crawl over and get the one in the very back it's God right God's purpose is not going to be defeated right right you're going to get here if you're supposed to be here all right now let's go to number 43b he said but listen my dear you lovely little thing now this is Satan talking to Eve surely God Made You for a purpose you know that's right see you're a woman you were made for this purpose what was Satan doing through the Beast he was showing what he was showing the animals and what they were doing right they were procreating and and having babies so he said hey this is what you're made for Satan s through the beast that's what you're made for that's what it is you don't know it now but you were made for this purpose oh you're a lovely little deer old thing dear look at those dainy little hands well sure you will sure he said but oh you think that a good loving father God would do a thing like that yeah now you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of God through a spoken word y so that's how we were supposed to come yeah that's how the family was supposed to be made by the will of God through a spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait went into that so the natural act happened what natural act happened stopped you and I from being born the way we should have been born right so we had to come another way through the double Covenant coming down and through women being made to where to have children there's no secret that that's what you're supposed to do all right let's go next one now notice what happened to Eve's children the first one that was born now if God said multiply to his bride to Adam's bride and replenish multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's commission and she would have done it and he would mix themselves together but what happened when Adam got ready to come to her she was already a mother see what I mean when God give a commission which cannot perish God's word is eternal it cannot fail when he said multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's eternal purpose yeah to carry that out you cannot die because it's his word you have to live if that child been brought forth right there' have been no death but remember she couldn't wait right all right let's go to the next one note God purpos for husband and wife to bring forth children he was establishing the family the family is God's intended results of the marriage relationship that he established in Eden cuz he was what Jehovah God right father with a family am he wanted to be a daddy amen before Adam and Eve become before Adam become a daddy he become a daddy right because Adam was a Son of God right right all right so let's go through next one the way to have Fellowship his heart is greater for Fellowship than ours and the reason he makes us that way is because we're offsprings of his that's what makes us long for Fellowship that's what makes a woman would die for her baby why that's what makes a father would give his life for his wife a husband a true husband would give his life for his wife why because Christ gave his life for the church his wife it's a strain in you listen to this want you to listen to this and it makes a mother Dash to a burning fire not thinking about her own self and her hair on fire and her clothes on fire to grab her baby and run out with it why it's love of a parent and God is the first and Original Parent amen and there's where that strain comes through that's why it's in US yeah cuz God is that way he went through hell to get me and you right he went through hell to get me and you physically I mean literally he went down the hell you know we went with him so we don't have to go anymore but he stopped all this business to bring us up but that's where the strain comes from CU God's the first original Parent all right so we can learn something from what the way God treats us is the way we should treat the children correct all right now let's go to the next one excuse me Mother's Mother's Day here's the one I wanted you to to see then we shall see him then we shall be like him then we shall worship him then we shall see mother as God wants her mother would not be complete there without her family cuz the greatest time of all her life is to see the children children around the table and all of them healthy and happy and to see her pour the coffee or whatever she does and fixes supper and her dad her and Dad sit down while that's the happiest time in Mama's life see her kitties all at home now don't miss don't be missing that day let the great chain of your family be hooked together link by link let every spoke be in the wheel and then when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of Eternity what a day that will be then we'll understand amen amen you s there with your families and groups across the canopies of Eternity cuz you remember when brother Brown went across a curtain of time he didn't see Paul he didn't see irenius what did the angel tell him he he said are these all brandom he said no they're your converts exactly so they were in a group y inside the sixth Dimension there's a group of people that come under bram's Ministry there's a group that come under Paul's irenius Martin Columba Moody any of those I mean they were born again but he must have not have been able to see them but he says right here their family and groups yeah across the canopies of Eternity all right let's go to the next one I think of sometimes how mothers will refuse to raise children bring up children and young women practicing birth control and buy a little dog and lead them around and you only realize lady that just about 20 years of your life that you have that God's lotted to you that you're going to be able to do this great Duty for God do you know your child might be a modern f or something like that do you realize just 20 about 20 years of your life is as long as you you'll be able to raise children and all through the eternities you'll enjoy the blessings of God if you bring a child in this world and raise it right that star that shining Yonder in glory you'll be associated with it see and then to refuse to raise the little fellas because you'd rather take your running around and carrying on that's ridiculous you shouldn't do that and now don't do it no sir don't you do it you be a happy person mothers of old they love to raise children but all this modern American day that we're living in now I tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left to this nation as I see only an oldfashioned Revival and according to the scripture it'll never be Nationwide right amen so they're done with that all right let's go to the next one all right preparing for children this is where I wanted to get to Psalms 127 3-4 and I want you to all perk up and wake up I don't have a problem with children sleeping the adults the ones that needs to be awake excuse me low children are a Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward see you ought to see right there that that Moses wasn't talking about a piece of fruit right you're the fruit of your mother right so when Moses was writing the accounts of what happened in Genesis right Moses was the one who wrote The Genesis right he wrote Don't partake of that fruit yeah not an apple brother Chris the scriptures all through there tells you this you're the fruit of your mother so it's not an apple that they that she ate she partook of another type of fruit to make the fruit of her womb is his reward right as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth all right keep going children's children of the crown of old men and the glory of children of their fathers all right just keep running through them this is scripture all for all for uh raising children but I'll get to something in just a minute tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation how do you think before we had text messages and and computers and all that stuff how was stories told passed down through generation children to children children to Children the uh Indians the Indians kept all their history in here yeah the old Shaman would pass it down to the next guy that that that that listen our problem is that's what I said this morning you got to listen right right we got to listen listen to what God has to say all right Matthew 18 and I said verely I say unto you except you be converted and become as Little Children You shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven look how important to be to act like a little kid sometime whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same as greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me amen all right let's go to Ephesians 6 and 4 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition admonition of the Lord this is what want to get to right here all right let's go the word nurture means to cultivate when we cultivate a crop we're constantly doing what needs to be done to see that that crop reaches maturity and produces what it should you don't just go throw seed out there and walk away and come back in two months later and expect a crop you're going to get a crop it's going to be weeds it's going to be this and that and the other it's going to be suckers it's going to be things that are growing that you don't want growing right so what does say the Bible say I'm not making this up the Bible says to nurture bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord children it it requires constant awareness of what's happening to the crop in other words go look at it and it requires that the one doing the cultivating is involved daily with the crop you see a little thing pop up about this High correct that's a weed that's going to just keep keep on growing and take over if you don't cut it off when it's little mama used to have a little old bitty ho that thing probably wasn't hoes are usually about you know about like that about that wide she had that thing F down it would about that big but boy she could get under them plants and she can she can knock them uh suckers and all that other stuff out from under and not hurt the crop what was she doing she was cultivating she was waiting she was doing something to help her crop grow up to what maturity all right that's the same thing you and I are our responsibility is to raise our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord that they will grow up and be mature right all right the crop must have the right environment Soil and Water also pulling of weeds and getting rid of the bugs that could harm the crop all right let's go to the next one Proverbs 13:24 this is what I didn't put in here the last time read the book of prover or the whole chapter in the Proverbs read the whole book and you'll get a lot about life he that spareth his Rod hateth his son yeah the Bible said he that spareth his Rod hateth his son yeah but he that loveth him chasteneth him many times right not just once yeah I'm telling you people I see some of you doing it you can't be a friend to your child you can let him grow up and be a friend later but you got to be a daddy a mama to those children you can't be friends amen being friend that friend well you know what friend does friend runs you to Mama and runs you to Daddy Daddy's going to whip you mama's going to love you mama's going to love you Daddy's going to whip you you got a battle back and forth that's jun's not she's sitting back there she'll tell you she a not that's probably been our only battle right only real battle is that I'm the bad guy right CU I'm the bad guy and she said right cuz she makes me the bad guy but don't do that don't do that don't support your children remember you're guilty kids until proven innocent yeah so says the parents of the United States of America yeah you're guilty if you're not guilty you're going to be guilty of something to get by with so like I said if I give you one that you rather didn't need you probably didn't get one that you should have got so you run out about even this is Bible he that spareth his Rod hateth his son you're doing them a disservice by letting them get by with that but he that loveth him chasteneth him many times or be times let's go to the next one Proverbs 231 13-14 withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with a rod he shall not die Bible Thou shalt beat him with the rod that's two scriptures and shallal deliver his soul right from hell exactly that's Bible withhold not correction from the child if thou beatest him with a rod he shall not die there's two things they took out of school that really took this nation down that was prayer and whipping in school that's right amen you asked my sister back there little kids five or six years old telling her she's a blankety blank blank blank blank that wouldn't a happen when I went to school hey when I was going to school I graduated 1978 for those on the inter internet they was teachers that had paddles that had names on them they had names for these things they were this big and they would drill holes in them to keep the air yeah from getting between your high end in the board they drill holes in them and call them big Bera and the rod of Correction and they wouldn't just whip you like this I had one teacher Old Miss Haren she'd take that thing like a baseball bat oh what amen and she make you touch your toes and if you took your fingers off of your toes you got another one you you remember Miss Heron big old big big teacher oh my goodness anyway she was mean but you know what I remember that and I needed everyone I got yeah and like I said I got a buy with something I should have got but I didn't get but Thou shalt beat him with a rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell now you're not going to that's not going to beating the child's not not going to save him but let's let's look at the next one train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it TR up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it amen now I'm not telling you you know when it says beat your child that doesn't mean beat with bruises like danad said and then one thing never do never whip your child when you're mad right amen don't whip your child when you're mad right Dad was real good at that mama was a little she she just quick I mean she just knew you needed it before you even did it so you were fixing to get it anyway so hairbrush or whatever it was but I needed them I'm telling you but but I'm telling you the contrast though but Daddy would set you down he talk to you for 30 minutes and you knew at the end of that 30 minutes you is going to get a weapon so I just say come On Pop just give me the just give me the weapon I'll just take the weapon don't talk to me but talking what did he do talking settled him down yeah talking give him the motivation Y and and not to beat the kid with anger I'm going to give you three legs Ashley's going out with Jaden now I knew I was going to get three licks cuz that's he believed in Perfection I'm glad to didn't believe in completion Perfection was okay three not seven thank God it wasn't a jubilee year but we laugh but you know honestly it works somewhere there connected to your brain is your rear end somewhere there's a connection there's a there's there's things running back and forth that if you get if you get a bad idea here you going to start hurting back here cuz Mom and Dad's fixing to let you have it but now not in this day and age we let our kids do what they want to do you know they rule us around but this says train up a child in the way you should go train what do you do when you train for a fight or you train for for um a football game or anything what you do you practice practice that's what they did to me terance and I never got a away him but they didn't me ter they train they practice on us prain up for child in the way should go when he's old he will not depart from it all right now let's go to the next one listen to this one I like this one Proverbs 1 7-10 the fear of the Lord is but look how he starts out look how he starts out now here here's this is Solomon he had a thousand wives so he probably had a few kids in there yeah the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction that's what I'm trying to give you today instruction my my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother right right right for they shall be an ornament of Grace unto thy head kids that's what he's saying for they who Mom and Dad shall be an ornament of Grace of course you thought it was law and destruction but it's not it was Grace cuz they knew if you were going in this pathway cuzz remember just like God's knows are the best yeses we could get we got to remember our parents were the same way they can see things coming a mile off 10 miles off Josh knows it he couldn't get in trouble I mean boy poor boy couldn't breathe while he got in trouble but they shall be an ornament of Grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck my son if Sinners entice thee consent thou not right in other words if you get enticed or or my son if Sinners enticed the consent thou not in other words don't talk to him right right all right let's get over to keep going Proverbs 3 my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth right amen he correct even as a father the son in whom he delighted amen for whom the Lord loveth he correct right he's not correcting the whole world right they won't accept it remember if you don't accept correction you're a bastard child anyway that's talking about in the uh in here we're talking about spiritual but look what he says even as a father the son in whom he delighted right so kids remember Jo your Daddy loves you and your mama loves you even when they with you they love you okay pray up for child in the way it should go and when he's old he may not understand it now but when he's old he'll not depart from it all right Proverbs keep going Proverbs is full of this full of of of of Family Matters listen to this kids you can even get Wise by getting whipped yeah yeah Mark says I don't know about that the rod and Repro give wisdom but a Child Left to himself in other words with no guidance right A Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame right when the wicked are multiplied transgression increaseth but the rightous shall see their fall right correct thy son and he shall give thee rest right amen amen correct thy son and daughter and he shall give thee rest yeah he shall give Delight unto thy Soul yeah all right one more Exodus 20 and 12 I put this one in here because you know what this is the first of the Ten Commandments that has a promise behind it right the first of the Ten Commandments has a promise behind it has to do with sons and daughters yeah that's right honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee amen kids honor your father and your mother right you may not like what they do you may not like their correction but honor them because they know what they're talking about all right honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long you see a lot of these kids getting killed at 14 12 16 yeah God didn't say if you were a sinner or Saint he could said honor your father and your mother so these people out in the world that don't honor their mother and father and I know a bunch of them some of these kids said to my mama what they said to their mama they'd be talking different for a few days I promise you that but you wouldn't do it a second time cuz you'd remember remember that connection between here and here somewhere that light goes on down here and you go oh if I do that again that thing's going to start hurting but I said about whipping you don't have to beat them with a rod like Daddy said it's a very good idea don't whip them in raft but take you a long switch and I don't know if anybody on the internet knows what a keen Hickory is but Keen means something that's real it's real narrow like a like a pen or a a needle but it's long and we have them here in America and U they're called hedge bushes and they grow big long leaders on them it's got Little Flower things that stick out well if you ever heard those things start going they were cleaning it off to whip you with it yeah they weren't cleaning there was no other purpose God made those things with just to whip you with there was no other purpose right all right and don't bring them one less size of a pencil either they'll go out and pull it out from the Roo and with you with the whole tree right so you got to bring them a good one yeah cuz what happens is that thing goes to swishing and in a keen Hickory Hickory is wood and that's what that that's what that comes from but boy you talking about strapping somebody's leg you'll remember you talking about speaking in tongues buddy you you be speaking in Tong and that H you man don't let them ever get a hold of you too cuz you can go around they can do this right here all day long that don't hurt a parent a parent just do this all day long never get dizzy got put something in our brain when when we become uh when we become parents that we're superhuman in certain ways you know we can hold on to a kid and whip them all day long and doesn't bother us but look honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God has given thee there is a promise that if you honor your mother and father you're going to live long amen okay all right so now but now look let's go to the next one this doesn't happen at church or at school this should happen at home amen see you know because what y'all do is y'all bring him in here and say brother Dale pray for my child he's got a devil yeah now if you were talking to me I'd say no you got the devil let's pray for you and then you can beat that when out of the kid cuz you take care of these things at home all right brother the scriptures all there let's just obey it that's all as many as I love I rebuke that's the this age is that right so and then the Bible said also in Hebrews the 12th chapter and 8th verse and if they cannot stand and won't take rebuke they are illegitimate and not sons of God a man blows up a woman oh I ain't going to listen to that anymore I don't have all right go ahead illegitimate right pretty tough for a prophet huh yeah that's exactly but a real child of God will take his correction saying yes Father it's your word I've got to straighten up now I've got to do what's right you know that's truth isn't it an illegitimate is the one that always backs off in the fly of the suit yeah to just kind of upset something but the real child of God admires admires to be rebuked and straightened up I know my old father never whipped me one time but what I oh a prophet got a whipping yeah he did I know my old father never wh me one time but what I bless every lick he hit me to make me what if I wasn't been for that why I probably been a renegade myself so I that's what's the matter with too many little Ricky and so forth you let them run out here and throw around and ston their foot and little Mary I just won't do that she ought to had my mother that's right yes sir we got too much now just letting the kids no wonder we got juvenile delinquency you know what caused it parent delinquency that's what started it yes sir you didn't keep your children around you let them out in these places and carry on like this and Endor it no wonder we're in such an age as we are now let's go to the next one excuse me scoll that right on through you know what I mean everybody has their own opinion but one of the greatest and to my opinion the greatest president that ever had in this nation was Abraham Lincoln now not because he was a republican because he was what he was a godly man and he was raised he said and he to serve God and he said if there's anything that I want to give praise to he said or my life was influenced by was a Godly mother who taught me to pray and to know Jesus as my savior yeah oh your family is what you are you raise your child in a certain environment it's got a 98% better chance to go right then it has if you bring it up in the wrong way bring up a child in the way it should go and when it's old will not depart from it be brought U right teach your children to do right to be honest to be square and fair even when they're in school yeah all right go to the next one now here's L of the C and church age he's talking about us po people talk about wealth in the church and why there never has been such a show of wealth the beautiful sanctuaries are multiplied in numbers as never before the bearish groups VI with each other to see who can build the biggest and the loveliest and they build Education Centers worth unestimated millions and those buildings are used only an hour or two a week now that would not be such a terrible thing but they expect this little time spent by the children in the education plant to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given yeah in the home
