because we do we always try to tell all the minister brethren there they're special when it comes to times you know you know then we appreciate them so you make sure you tell them that you appreciate them on a Christmas time because that's that's a time for all things all right Jonah - in Genesis 15 father we thank you for your grace and your love and thank you for everything Lord we just ask you that you'd come among us this day and just bless us with your presence we're glad you let the weather kind of clear out Lord and we didn't get to have the two services today but yet we can take care of that Lord and just minister for you and just have a good time in you and thank you that you would give all of us a safe journey and everything be okay and just let your Grace and love be with us forgive our sins and lead us in Jesus name Jonah - remember we're on salvation but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that I have mild salvation is of the Lord in the Lord spake unto the fish and what did it do what a salvation name deliverance what did it happen and it had vomited out Jonah upon the dry land so he was delivered so we're on dealing with sanctification alright now let's read this and it'd be a lengthy part so just bear with us of Genesis 15 because I want to try today if I can to finish up the Old Testament or the tops and the shadows because that's what we're dealing with the Old Testament is tops and shadows of the new and we want to try to end that if we can and start in the New Testament then with it in an understanding chapter 15 verse 1 after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram and a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and I seed in great reward what a wonderful thing for God to say about you right and Abram said Lord God what will give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this eva's are of Damascus now evidently Abram must have been having this bearing on his mind called why would verse 1 be like it is and in verse 2 and you know and he'd say unto the Lord all right and Abram said Behold to me thou has given no seed and lo worn one born in my house is mine heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels she'll be dying and I remember that it's gonna come out him so why does he doubt later all of these other things you know all right and he brought him forth abroad and said looking out toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed I love this one and he believed in the Lord and it was counted and he counted it to him for righteousness he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it now he's gotten the land he was on a child thinking about it and concerned about no no offspring now it flops over and God's talking to him about land because he tells him playing up here you're gonna have a child it's coming from your bowels right now he falls to the land once and he said Lord got worse I shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she-goat of three years old and around what three years old and a Turtledove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the mist and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not that's the type of divine healing the Prophet says there's not divided and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away and when the Sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lowered Hara of great darkness fell upon him no I'm sorry to keep you standing to do it but remember we start off Abram worried about thinking about a child and then it falls to God talking about land and and you know you'll inherit this and then he starts making a promise and this is what the Prophet said one day because you read that there's no way to know what he's talking about I mean honestly you read it find out what he's talking about he's going this way he's going this way he's over here he's over there this is what the Prophet said he said Abraham was a prophet and said would know what God meant in what he was saying I love that you know his son was going down to deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo and horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know first surety thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them for hundred years Egypt right Israel into Egypt for hundred years right telling them what's going to happen to the people in the natural and also that nation whom thou shalt serve what I judge and afterwards shall they come so they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace and I shall be buried in a good old age once he's right down to his death that's what I said you read this and then you tell me what he's talking about he goes this way close that way back all right but in the fourth generation they shall come for the other four then Nick with the other am arises not yet fool and it came to pass that when the Sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that pies between those pieces once and in the same day the Lord made a covenant with a from saying unto thy seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt unto the great river of the river Euphrates any names of places names all of it but now I remember what I said there the other day he never gave Abram the whole world the only gave him part of it there was a reason for that you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word all right never said we we sometimes don't consider maybe the things and I've tried to make it a point that we're dealing with salvation meaning deliverance it can mean those things but it's also meaning of talking about salvation in the basis of you know to you inheritance of eternal life and the different things of the word salvation that help for the mom and dad with us but to just think about it God made a covenant with Abraham Abram and told him all of these things like I said if he had not been a prophet he would have not known what any of this would be dealing with because I'm asking you to just take it and sit down and express it you're talking about children you're talking about land you're talking about promises you're talking about covenants you're talking about all kind of things that really now what's the statement I make or I'm trying to try to end it today see then with Abraham it would finally wind up the Old Testament as to the point of talking about Redemption now not that anybody else won't be saved no no no we're talking about the way things are done the way God does it he puts it all into Abraham because we're gonna get to it in a minute Abraham comes to the change of the body right so now you see that what I've done there Sunday I just I mean no Wednesday I just went so far and I had to stop because we said why did you quit it just 8:31 that have been 12:30 if I to finish the notes to the services but still now listen we've got to drop back because of the people not knowing what we've been on for a little bit to to try to cover brother Branham said that God made three covenants with mankind the unconditional sound uncertain sound sixty-two he made three covenants one with Adam one with Noah and one with Abraham or technically Abram all right now I know because see I look these things up but a random won't say on another you said wait a minute he just made two covenants couldn't he made one with Adam and he made one was with Abraham well that's true but don't leave no out of it you know because there was a covenant there made but that's the point that I've been driving at for you to see what kind of a covenant was it that was made with Adam we went here and we go through and we pick it up we go over in and can see many things that are taking place and now I've got a lot of scriptures in time I will not read them I'll just pick them and doing them because I want them on the internet so that the internet system people should know the scriptures that I'm using you know to make sure they follow the line all right yeah so there was three covenants made one with a brick one was Adam 1 with Noah and one with Abraham all right now what weirdo cut those covenants I asked you two to show it to me in it to show it to me in the Bible and the reading well what did he get her covenant now the covenant I read here is Abraham so don't get that involved you know and say wait a minute now see this is Genesis 15 so let's drop back to the Genesis 2 and 3 what was the Covenant that God made with Adam the random say it he made a conditional covenant with Adam a conditional covenant he put conditions in the Covenant what was the Covenant I just asked a simple question Sunday they've been asking it over what was the Covenant I mean can you read what happened in Genesis and find that that there had to be a Covenant made with Adam on condition remember the end that he was put on free moral agency with a right to choose okay and by his choosing he made the wrong choice but what was he told before then remember how in this situation Adam was in according to blasphemous names if so was eternal probably said he breathed into his nostrils the breath of eternal life so then he saw was eternal his spirit and his body was an eternal no his body was a creation and he spirit would have been a career bringing in but it was not eternal all right didn't you come to the Prophet in the seal book and reading it and finding it that veteran says that Adam lost the right to the earth and the human body because what else did he lose the right up the day you eat thereof that day you die Adam lived separate one hundred more years but he finally died after the all right so then what happened what was the Covenant don't you eat of that tree of knowledge of good and evil right don't eat it there's a don't remember a covenant it do's and dont's he said in other words you eat of the Tree of Life and you'll remain as you are in this condition the Prophet even said it he said God gave to Adam as he was leaving he said he simply just renewed his life every day in his flesh that's what he done it you know because it was it would have been not eternal so he wouldn't have aged he wouldn't have done anything but he would renewed a brother Ron said that his youth was being renewed each day all right but now when he fell and he'll never lost eternal life in his soul now I don't you know if people say well they saw brother branham city lost eternal life you better read real good and you better try to understand a lot the code is not interpreting or it's correct a prophet with his plain common sense you can't have eternal life and lose it so Adam never lost eternal life in his soul but he lost the right to the earth and to bringing forth of you and I am i right would not it mended it they would have brought us forth it would have been spoken word multiplication rod but he they would have brought us forth so he lost that right and brought us in a sinful condition so now there's your covenant don't eat of that tree and everything will be all right you remind as you are and you've been okay and you'll bring forward everything will be done the promise we had the condition don't eat of that tree now I hope you followed the point now brothers will that is still right here today today we're still eating of the tree of knowledge oh no bless God I've I believe in everything the Prophet said if we doubt one word of the Bible which to me I put the prophets message the Bible put it in the correct order that he made mistakes as a human being he corrected the mistakes and all like that but the prophets the message is perfect the Prophet made mistakes okay we agree okay now in doing that then me you see that he lost really the redemptive part that would have come into view of his body because eventually something would have had to happen to it okay because it so was eternal or see then he lost our bodies and that's why we had to come to where we come he lost us in the basis and we have to come as mortal human beings not eternal okay what are you following me see then we pick up to Noah and the Prophet said Noah because it was on condition and this is the best way he said he said it got broke he didn't necessarily say Noah broke it who broke it he said it got broke so that's just I guess the best way the Prophet could do because I asked you to tell me one thing I asked it son a Wednesday tell me what was the covenant to Noah what was his covenant what was it to Noah don't do this and do this because if it was a covenant of conditions it had to do this in the don'ts I expressed it to try to get your little emphasis of it to get you to see that mankind in that day was for taking of the tree of knowledge the God told Adam I told Noah said don't you partake of that tree come on didn't Paul say I'm afraid that Satan will tempt you he said yeah but as I said a moment ago but we say but I'm eating of the Tree of Life one word is all it takes we're eating the tree of knowledge there was the tree of knowledge which was the entire world set up to be the way it was a great metropolis a great thing the Bible says as it was so as it is now so was so it was a modern civilization that gar all right here is Noah taking a hammer and some nails and a saw and spent 120 years sewing boards we only had to do was call somebody up and say build me an arc make me a Titanic make it double proof Titanic let's see that would have been eating of the Tree of Knowledge Noah was eating of the Tree of Life because he's doing what God told him is that a truth that understanding we have father the point I was trying to make to Noah then his do's and don'ts was what bill that are the way I say because you got to admit the ark is the Covenant we're going to rest in the scriptures you know I make a covenant with you so Noah is building the ark according to what God told him there's his covenant he's staying away from the tree of knowledge of good and evil because that would have been the do's and the don'ts now naturally there were certain things no one had to deal with in the natural of you know the life so then he was a little bit for taking of the life because if he had a hammer somebody made it they had to solve somebody made it if he had wood somebody's growed it you understand what I'm saying so then he was kind of not holding 100% with what God said you said well he could have done no he could have done it no other way so I ain't worried about it I'm just making a point you to think about that Noah done his Adam done Noah lost the Prophet said he he broke it okay well what was his breaking of it you'll find out if you'll keep reading in the book of they're of Genesis you'll find out what happened to Noah then you'll see that he did break the covenant with God because may I quote brother Branham Noah died a drunk I'm quoting him Noah died a drunk he didn't keep the great straight covenant that would have been right as Adam stay with this side over here and eat right but he went over to this side - Noah do this keep everything straight and come out of this living the right life he goes over and he falls he wouldn't eternally lost no because he had a covenant now if you go read in Genesis and start with Genesis you'll find a lot of good things in the Word of God you remember how we were bringing out that there in Adam God never cursed brother brother said future home God never cursed Adam and Eve he cursed the beast part that away put him down and he cursed the land right he cursed the land but isn't it marvelous that when you start with Noah God starts to cleanse the earth and Mariah he starts to cleanse the earth by washing it with water right come on and you realize your body and I'm quoting from the future home our bodies were in the earth at that time so then brother Branham when he comes to future home he preaches what he said your body was justified in the days of Noah he said sanctified in the days of the Lord Jesus and said one day it'll be made eternal so look at what God is doing he's laying out his plan of salvation the fall filed an atom but it falls into atom of genesis 3:15 that the promise comes of the seed of the woman to come forth see the promise was made you remember how we were bringing it out which came first grace her law grace came before the law ever came into existence grace was before the foundation of the world right so you follow now all right now listen he cursed the Beast Genesis 1:14 he cursed the ground 3 and 17 just giving you these from Genesis he didn't curse Adam and Eve right around him future home he never cursed that he cursed the earth all right now when it comes to that then here comes Noah and God says violence's over the earth and I'm going to destroy it they said make you an arc I'm gonna give you a covenant I'm gonna give you a covenant that will be forever lasting he said they didn't say eternal he said everlasting I want to give you an everlasting covenant Noah and said all you got to do you make an ark you make it out of gopher wood verse Genesis 19 19 I'll establish my covenant with you and your seed after you what was his covenant starting to restore the plan of salvation what is the starting of your salvation justification one water baptism come on water baptism starting off repentance what about to see what happened in the days of Noah what I'm trying to get you to do is read the Bible but read it with common sense sometimes read what happens in Genesis 1 then read what happens in two and three and then four and just keep reading it like that reading to see what's taking place and how that God comes down and says you make me an ark of gopher wood not of metal not of any of these things that's the tree of knowledge you make it from where it will fit the tree of life because it would fit all the way down to Jesus Christ then he said I'll establish my covenant they'll remember what he said died Adam Adam would have been okay if you went straight now noise promised they didn't establish his covenant with him with at with Noah would you remember this this is 9 and 11 I'll establish my covenant with thee and neither shall any more of the waters ever come forward you know what he established yes the evidence not only with Noah but he established it with the earth it comes remember your body was in the earth are you following me a covenant your body now you tell me where it was that did it come from Venus Mars or Jupiter then no no no your earth comfort your body coming here it might have took six thousand years to get you yet there me and you been here but I didn't got nothing to do with it it's still the truth alright then you go a little further with Noah and watch it go from the earth got to remember to Abraham it would go to the heavens remember later on in the scriptures it goes to the sand of the seashore the number is people Noah starts off numbering and telling them I don't do this but what about the most marvelous thing taking place when they came out of the ark God made a covenant with Noah and his people but he made a covenant with the earth I will not destroy the world any more about water no you ain't gonna need it he's gonna burn it with fire one day yeah he is cuz he's got to have its fiery baptism because we gotta have a fiery baptism come on the redemptive plan is what I'm trying to get you to see so we're stopping with know what to see that it starts back to showing a covenant of redemption to mankind and even not only that but the world because I keep stating that cause I want you to think about because remember your body was in the earth our body was justified in the days of Noah but a runner said sanctified in the days of the Lord Jesus he said then will receive a fiery baptism remember we move ahead so disremember alright and he says Noah this token Genesis 9 and 17 this is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth you don't think about that rainbow you're just thinking about it it means well no it just means whurling gonna be destroyed water tomorrow it's a covenant it's a covenant that you will one day receive the body in the right condition and we can see truly it has come through a plan of redemption and brings it out to the end of eternal life think about it just looking at your scriptures did you Father then know what you got your place no I said okay I'm doing the best I can we said I'm a human being and I can't do all of it so he died a drunk I'm quoting your prophet now you go to our and the scripture tells you and all of that and the things happen and all the situation it happened in Noah in his sons and all of this that in the other just reads your Bible but the plain language brother instead he died a drunk why because the Covenant he was receiving was still tied to the earth and had it's connections with the natural earth okay but what's it as it advances because we know that God made a covenant we read it in Genesis 12 and 2 I'll make a make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee back up right before the end of verse before and sent unto the land and I will show thee everything I tried to get it across to you when ste Noah Adam to Noah Abraham everything will always be connected to this earth it'll be connected to this earth everything every covenant ever thought because of one thing your body was in that earth if we're gonna redeem the earth you're gonna redeem my body it's got to be done but not think about it I'll make a da Abram a great nation and I'll bless them that bless thee you know all of the things he said I'll give you the lay in the land of Canaan was in that land caimans a great wonderful thing to Israel in there we read they're worried the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto thy seed will I give this land and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him that's jumping over the thirteenth chapter xiv birth after a lot was separated because he wasn't supposed to go with him like wasn't supposed to went with Abraham or Abram as we talked because he was still part of the old Adamic nature called mankind and sin in there no promise are you listening and not a promised a lot promise was Abram he takes Lord along with him he gets in trouble and God emphasizes it said now when he separated from lot now you look lift up thine eyes after you separate from lot and look for the place where thou art northward southward eastward and westward and still don't give him now listen he still don't give him the whole world that was the point I tried to make because he specifies to Abram where his boundaries is at well just read over our Canaanites and Jeff besides this size see because the whole world ain't in the Covenant with us he told Abram he said Abram should you walk through the land and said I'll give you every word you said to soul of your village you realize he's walking on you yeah but I'm an American born over here that's you got a good talk about ain't much common sense you ain't listening to the story but a Brennan said nothing necessarily the same gases I like to study the message to where I know the answer to that he said not to same at gases but he said the same elements the elements is in us it don't matter where you were born that that don't make any difference you know don't worry about that part of it and try to figure it out just let it be what it is when Abraham when he was walking he was walking all around Jerusalem Israel up and down I said I'll give you everywhere you put your foot there's a covenant a possession but what was the point to Abram walk through the land neighbor who still comes up and he said Lord I've got to land but said you've mentioned down through here of me and my seed that I don't have any now you see why he appears in Genesis 15 were read and he starts talking about I don't have any seed God has already spent the whole time behind him 12 through 15 describing the seed that would come forth and let alone be in the seed that would come from genesis 3:15 and seed which is Christ as we come over the river in the scripture pick him up because it was Abraham the seed of Abraham by faith which is Jesus Christ all right but hey vroom says Lord you talked a lot about me you've mentioned a lot of things by the way no children it's okay we'll take care of that and he wouldn't it so hard how he could handle it first I love it because he starts off and it says that Abram believed God you know his name was Abraham start with his Abram right we'll get to that in a minute so he didn't have a lot to do he had justification he had thoughts of sanctification a cleansing of the land and the bringing forth but he doesn't have the example yet of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he's looking at land he said Lord where do I get much children that you've been telling me about he said okay I'm gonna show you and like I said he said Abraham wasn't a prophet so he puts Abraham to sleep showing him he's gonna be out of his control right we read it he put him to sleep took him out of it showed him the darkness of Hell and that we all deserved it but then he showed him that he was gonna bring forth and it said eighteenth verse and said the same day God made a covenant with Abram remember his name was Abram to start with he had a son named Exmoor well his name was Abram but he had no son named Isaac until his name was changed so then the bible's ride said take that son not only son he's talking to Abraham he ain't talking to Abram Abrams the guy done gone he's talking to Abraham he said take thy son thine only son of Dolf him he didn't take excellent Isaac both he took Isaac up see it's the plan of redemption you understand what I'm saying the plan of redemption is all the way through the Bible and it's showing because of the Prophet being able to give us the right answers just read the message get the unconditional covenant and listen to it you know them it's listen to the whole message you know 50 years I've been listening to it we ought to know a little bit about it you know studies a little bit but to study the plan of redemption that plan of redemption was spoke up from Genesis will you see the fall then you see that Noah and you see him cleansing the earth and you see Abram in watching Abraham's walking around on the cleansed earth right he says everywhere you put you foot I'm gonna give it to you redemption is in process back that I'll make my covenant between me and D and I will multiply the exceedingly you don't have any children at all yet he starts talking about he's gonna give him this seed he shows him it's the Prophet said it's unconditional said he put him to sleep took him totally out of the picture and then made the covenant the Covenant to show what he's gonna do are you listening to a point I'm trying to make see Noah starts off about an earth in a cleansing then God puts a rainbow in the sky he need to held April look to the sky your children to be like the stars in the sky is he speaking of salvation then it comes on through Noah comes into Abram and Abram he starts talking about his seed and about a child he wouldn't talk about children he was talking about a child that was to be born a promised child that would come from the covenant and that child would be Isaac in check your Bible I'll get it in here somewhere but he even makes takes the conent was with Abraham or Abram he transfers and said Isaac will have this true in his shall be for an endless one because it's the promise I'll establish my covenant with thee and thy seed after thee in their generation for an everlasting covenant ain't mentioned do's and don'ts because it was not made on condition I won't get to that today because they take too long we'd be here to five o'clock I'm I'm joking me we've take up the Lord willing and the next message is on the unconditional covenant because remember you're gonna try to talk about an unconditional covenant you better lay it in the right order you mean you can live like the devil and still die and go to heaven well if it's an unconditional covenant the way we think about unconditional that's just the point to lay in for you to think about what I found it what is that unconditional covenants then something happens with Abram I said these little keys would go along that's what I want you to thank him he would Noah and he's doing with the earth and the thing all at once he points him to a rainbow sends him up into the skies okay what happens with April happen with Abram Abram gets a little closer to a happening because God tells Abram not Abraham II ain't got to him yet he ain't changed his name yet that's the next stage this is where we got to Sunday Wednesday he said Abram you circumcised never Michael there's your covenant your covenant I'll make with thee this is my covenant which we you shall keep between me and you and that's ever met ever man child among you shall be circumcised Genesis 17 and verse 10 why does it follow the circumcision because that's his covenant he told you in Genesis he told you and they first started that's the seed of the woman who's going to come forward the seed of the woman is Jesus Christ circumcision at the top of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you've got no whole justification Abram starting a cleansing and getting everything in the right order and then he starts talking about circumcision why did he go to circumcision why did he go to circumcision they ended with that thought why did God come up and pick up and bring circumcision into view now you tell me you can't see the seed of the serpent then you're blind now you tell me you can't see the message about the seed of the serpent and what happened you're blind God remember that beast and Eve whatever you want to talk about you gonna come no other way because now you're coming all the way over to Abraham and Abraham says circumcise all they might remember sorry you don't circumcise females circumcise the male becomes Dara was where the beginning started with sin come on you tell me what happened in the garden I'll ask you why God said Abraham circumcised all them children because that's my covenant he calls it a covenant I make with thee this is my covenant which he shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised Genesis 17 and 1011 said in you sell circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant between me and you a token token is a price paid and showing you got hold it in you with in your hand see to Abraham now to Abram he said Abram we got to do a little something here to pick up a part about just about redemption Noah cleanse your body but it left a little bit of hanging can remember justification don't always work too good on everything then you argued that one is you now justification you can follow away from me but he said all right now you take circumcision in place that within it getting closer to the original or the real top that would come of the new birth god I thought we believed in the sink of it in the circumcision of the heart not the circumcision with a natural flesh today that's fine it's done people are doing it all of our kids were everybody basically does is they don't have to but it's not something to make them a Jew it's just a cleansing because they did find out that there was a lot of impurities the problems are so that's the reason they used the natural circumcision all right but the spiritual circumcision is the serf concision of the heart brother Louisa down in the butt in the sunday-school talking about it circumcising cutting off the foreskin are getting it close in sanctification a cleansing what's the next thing that happens after Abram gets a cleansing let's see if I can pick it up we know what it was he wound up getting a name change right Abraham got a name change I thought your prophet said true born-again Christians have a name shine now we're getting something to come over to new testament with pretty good we come over justification we can come over sanctification we can come over with a night change he said we've all had a nine times he said our name now as Christians he said there'll be a new name thing and what are you talking about brother Dale trying to show salvation spoke off taking everything and put it in the right order if you don't get it in the right order what are you gonna do with you see because in that Old Testament people outside of Adam and Eve and they were the first in creation the way God made them from then on down nobody had eternal life shorten short term in the Prophet Smith you can't even Shama come plain language you can't even show me Oh without the Prophet you can't show me that Adam had eternal life in his soul they just simply said he breathed into his nostrils become a living soul like I said about Abraham Abraham I'm gonna put you through this I'm going to show you these things I said nobody else ain't gonna be able to figure it out but said you're a prophet and you'll know what these things mean your prophet knew what those things spoke up and so marvelous we hear him in the early years when I first started listening the year of Abraham walking and the things he was doing and all like that it made the Bible just come alive I had read the Bible I knew this I knew he was Abram and I knew that he didn't have no children I knew you wouldn't Abraham until way later we read the Bible with the marvelous thing was the Prophet taking that and bringing it down to our day and to see we've got to come through justification sanctification the baptism was I want to go give me a few more minutes we told him he said now listen and what to change your name which is a rose name I love to read Darin Genesis or how many times that Abram met God before his name was changed to a Brian read it he met him a lot of times that his name was Abram which meant highfather they're doing pretty good with that we didn't are no children but then he wound up with a child and they said to your father of Nations but that wouldn't what he's looking for when he was looking for was Isaac the promised son to come the word that it would be into that doing and Isaac would even be incorporated as I said into the scripture that speaks of Isaac coming forth and said he'll be in a covenant - he changed the name of Abram to Abraham but around says gave him part of his own name join him the covenant is now brought down here stands a man on earth that God could use to bring a physical son of a Brian which would type the coming of Jesus Christ are you in cause listen he got a name changed once he got his name changed it went but one more thing this is what I like he got a name changed he got a body change he's running a room was changed to young man a young woman now if you don't think he was then you got a 87 year old man trying to not hear 100 year old man trying to father children by 90 year old woman oh they live longer back then yeah now they doesn't come to the curse of 120 years read you Bible the cursed falls on mankind about to where it comes with the building of the Tower of Babel somewhere in there or the flood he falls to 120 years you know how that five hundred a hundred years all right but listen in there old grandma 90 years old going down through there and that King that could have any woman he wanted and he picks out Sarah and wants to marry her and I don't approve there's something happened to Abraham and Sarah and the Bible says they were well stricken in years but listen they got a change of the body before they could produce the promised son they didn't need to change the body with a small head held a name to the body to fall for Isaac could come into being made them a young man and young woman when own neighbor Ham had about 40 and when I was six six kids six or seven kids after school well what you see church what I'm getting at circumcision at the top of the Holy Ghost then you come to a name change as a Christian receive eternal life right your body is still not redeemed your body today is in the process it's not redeemed it's getting older it was redeemed in Christ when Christ took down the River Jordan he said in this is my son and who I'm pleased to dwell the prophet of God made it better to understand it he says this is my part of the earth ivory game and said from this part here I'll redeem your bodies because that was literally what happened without Jesus Christ coming the way he came we couldn't have no hopes of a body and that's why your basics now listen and I'm not against them it's nobody's I'm here preaching the basics of the people of organized religion believe you're going to get a new body not high for the people of this message lay the same thing they don't believe in a bodily Redemption you say how do you know go ask them the best way to say it listen a little bit you listen to somebody one time I'm gonna get a new body next time he said not this body renewed and you don't know what they believe you actually said what that brother say I said he said he gonna get a new body and he said but he he wouldn't go get anybody so he's confused or I am one you know we listen what about Abraham and Sarah they could not had they had Ashville from Hagar and a broom but he gets his name changed because all things happens to him he gets circumcision because let's see when it explodes it was 13 years old when he was circumcised Abraham had to be circumcised too and he was in his 80s everybody had to be circumcised right so that was the promise that was the Covenant that was showing you the cleansing listen the cleansing of what it started from I hate to be vulgar it started from the niceness to physical cleansing to make ready the word you'd have any type and that still wouldn't be enough so he changed his name he changed his name that could top the baptism with the Holy Ghost but he doesn't finish the story because you see the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is not the finish of your story it's just the beginning the new birth is just the beginning he's not to finish then the Bible says being born again then we can go back and listen to the Prophet talk about what all these time flush he's over in the future home and he goes back and picks up justification sanctification the baptism when the Holy Ghost he says they still something got to happen future home I believe it 49 I'm not certain look for Tina he said your soul is redeemed said your body's not redeemed yet our body's not fully redeemed yet it was paid for at Calvary yes Jesus Christ paid for it all amen but it ain't been applied we're still getting older somebody is going to som were find out something in to me is to find out the whole Bible tells you what it is its justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then there's got to be a change of the body because Paul picks it up in the scriptures and said you have to have a change now not an exchange not working this and over don't have to be my new coat I want you to listen me I know sure I know what a lot of people think about me they think I'm a sarcastic arrogant kind of a guy that likes to show everybody how much he knows but one of these days you'll find out that ain't right you'll find out it ain't right so I don't have to worry about it you'll learn for yourself you'll say that guy was doing everything he could to try to preach salvation but 47 years I've been trying to trying to get meeting you to realize who we are what's going on now listen what's your profit covers with Abraham and Sarah so we'll pull this up go ahead brother Joe if you would jump over to 14 I know going jumping hurry but I've got some quotes from the Prophet don't want to read and just think about it Adam lost it Noah starts to plan a Redemption Abraham falls in line coming back to greater things and he goes from circumcisions he goes from knowing the Stars he starts picking up all the time in that quote let's see if brother Branham was trying to hang out the other day where he said from the shores to the star he said the resurrection the resurrection come in you see Church we got to have a resurrection for we now have a giant you know there's gonna be a resurrection before these bodies were changed they didn't cross your eyes first listen what's your prophet say isn't it of the macy's getting in the spirit he's brought you in order to receive the promised son so you know he's change the body failure in Abraham next after that message in order to receive the promised son and that's what he's done this church wrote it through the same thing the next thing is exchanged in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and going and will have to have a changed body now listen now Sarah and Abraham in that kind of a body could not receive the promised son Martin do you know what that means I Abraham and Sarah and their natural bodies they had to have exchange of the body to have the promised son ok watch they were a hundred years old he had to change their body what's not turned them back so much as too young which he did but also changed them because they'd been like they was all at the first plane no one following him Abraham and Sarah was young man a young woman at the first place they had the abilities for bringing forth right first place and it couldn't bring it in the first place so now you get what he's saying not turning back so much as young which he did but he also changed them because they'd been like they was at the first place but he changed their body in such a way that they could receive the son and now we find the next thing in order for the church is a changed body what's not as old people go back and be young so much that's what everybody thinks changes changing back to young man to young woman no it's to make eternal change you back to young man a young woman ain't worth nothing you're gonna die again it makes eternal are you following me the change makes eternal not makes you young come on notice old people go back to be young so much but we will and will be they're young just a certain but we've got to have a change body in order to receive the Sun because we're going to meet him in the air rapture will come a change in a moment in a twinkling of an eye not to just make you young again change this body to make it eternal come on next an excellent show vajura remember it's a promise royal seed immediately come in yes we'll be changed they were changed back to a young man and young woman just showing exactly what the church the role your seed is going to be done you say is that a promise first that's the only is 4:17 determined regard to the sound be changed at the moment we cannot be caught up together why her body their bodies had to be changed to receive the Sun now they had to be physically made young they were not made eternal now don't follow that line Abraham and Sarah wasn't made eternal they were made young we have to be made eternal because if not he just put us right back where they were what's it hold up why her body their bodies had to be changed and receive the Sun and our mortal of our bodies will have to be changed to receive the Sun cause we'll be caught up we'll have to be a different body from this now are you falling it will have to be a different body from there if you made this young what God would it do it be this body made young is that all you know about a change the change that I've always taught that comes in that way is an eternal body Abraham and Sarah didn't get an eternal body they both died we're going back to the garden where Adam lost that part what did he lose he lost the body he lost the earth no I started to cleansing Jesus Christ in the sanctification will have to be a different body from this in other words evidently pointing at it but we'll be caught up in the air to meet him Bible says we'll have a glorious body like honey is okay just right with her scripture you see they were changed if we ever meet the Lord in the air we can't meet him with this kind of a body cuz were earthbound but we're going to receive one hallelujah that'll go up in the rapture not a new body this body made new one game people say that then where did I say like I said wanna go you say Leo person say one time I'm gonna get a new body in the other knee turn back around little bit so it's body my new why don't you put it all together at one time and they say it it's not a new body it's dead body maybe eternal does this body come out of the earth and one day according to the future own this earth going to be made eternal no we with the Prophet see Abraham and Sarah had to be turned back to produce the promised son you and I are not going to produce the promise we're gonna produce the promised son and then be turned back cuz we gonna meet him in the air we ain't got to produce him we just got to go meeting in the air one day because he's made away okay look the next Easter notice all the reading now you come down through the placing of the Sun justification Abraham and his group next thing was the gun was a change and we don't seen everything through jest okay same case in the baptismal Togo placing the sun's signs and wonders of him being his presidency discern the thoughts as I as it was in the days of Sodom so she ought to be they come in the Son of Man what was the next the change of the body what's the next time - you and I we've done come through justification same case the baptism with all the colors the change of the body I show that this we are looking for an expected son than what you glory is that right we cannot meet him in these bodies if we are changed back to young men and women still we can't meet him because we have to meet him in the air so to prove where it goes to work there has to be something done besides change us back to a young man and woman we've got to be changed and caught up in the air to meet him and the next thing coming is the rapture to the church in the change of the body so we've been science to meet the Lord Jesus in the air is that enough not enough to show you justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's all topped out in the Old Testament showing exactly more we've posted wind up you can spend years preaching out of that I remember when I first come into message I used to preach in the the travel of Israel enjoy death in their journey and how they'd go this way and they'd go right away and then you'd see them come up with names Dan Ephraim's and all of that and you see God placing them right in order and how they line up and they go out and how they get started they do this I love that a whole Testament because you know what without the Old Testament and understanding it right you think you understand the New Testament oh yes we will oh no you won't because you don't have enough foundation the Old Testament stops and shatters of the New Testament to come are you following me all back there trying it with Abraham and Sabra turn back to a young man a young woman top in the rapture top in the change as we call it and leaving off of this earth Oh back down but you think that Old Testament water or I don't never getting that out of reading the Old Testament it is you know it's just much of rules regulations that ain't what it is it ain't what it is then brother Branham would take the Ten Commandments and make it the seals I don't think it's a bunch of rules and regulation I don't come on brothers I thought was supposed to be either where the Prophet said if you don't see Christ in ever verse of the Bible he said go back and read it again Christ throughout the Old Testament as well as the new topped out in the three things that the Prophet said there's three covenants made he said to him was made own condition he said but at to Abraham it was unconditional now we're gonna get into a little bit there cause like I said the way our thinking of our mind is we ate off the tree of knowledge so long until the thinking of our mind is an unconditional covenant means there ain't no way they could be any do's and don'ts what I want you to answer one scripture one not a whole Bible what why does it mention in the New Testament talking about Christians now talking about the world the Bible is not written to the sinner it's written to Christians why does it say you're gonna have to give an account of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad yeah but that ain't to me you just ate off the tree but your bite went to wrong you went to the tree of knowledge he just snapped down real good but it'll vomit your body out of you because it'll not work see you can't just be like if we thought us Baptists we told it once saved always say well I didn't agree with it then I didn't because I saw too many things in there they didn't look like that I thought it was supposed to be a Christian life believe it right turn is it unconditional they don't make no difference what I do I'm going to have them anyway you say that that's not that's not a Christian talking that's the devil talking you better get you straight than what you doing what we got read anybody have a need when we got
