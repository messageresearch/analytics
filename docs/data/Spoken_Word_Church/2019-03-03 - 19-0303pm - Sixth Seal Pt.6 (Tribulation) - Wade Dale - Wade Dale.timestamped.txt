[14:40] [Applause]
[14:42] missing the few we got an old crowded we
[14:44] got more people in the pulpit we had our
[14:46] first service here at length the whole
[14:48] church in 1971 so thank the Lord for
[14:55] each one use your talent for the glory
[14:59] of God and out for the world amen you
[15:04] got your Bibles let's go ahead and get
[15:05] started on the 6l part 6 today we're
[15:09] gonna talk about the tribulation just
[15:13] for a moment before we begin with the
[15:15] with the other part we're anticipating a
[15:20] good time in the Philippines desire you
[15:21] prayers thank you for some of you for
[15:24] giving us a little extra to to go with
[15:28] we appreciate that we're gonna be two
[15:30] weeks out with no salary and I bail Jill
[15:34] and I were talking the other day I'll
[15:35] just share this with you because even if
[15:37] even if brother Dale guilts or anybody
[15:40] gives $1,000 to a preacher on the
[15:42] weekend you think what's a lot of money
[15:44] I wish that I made that much by the time
[15:46] you pay your plane ticket your food
[15:48] putting your car at the airport taxes
[15:52] you would let down to about $600 maybe
[15:56] maybe 600 bucks so it's not all on the
[15:59] surface is nothing you know that you're
[16:01] taking some
[16:02] because you'd have to eat you have to
[16:04] live and and they got a couple of motel
[16:07] rooms for me to stay in but I told them
[16:09] I stayed with the people I like staying
[16:11] with the people I I've been to Jamaica
[16:12] 11 times and I don't think we've ever
[16:14] stayed in a motel if we ever you've
[16:16] never stayed in a motel the whole 11
[16:17] times I've been over there I haven't I
[16:19] know Berlinale gente neither we stay I
[16:21] like stay with the people as long as
[16:22] they're comfortable with that you know I
[16:25] mean if they're not comfortable with
[16:26] that that's okay but as long as we're
[16:28] comfortable with it I'd rather I think
[16:29] Apostle Paul live with the people you
[16:31] know they live with when he went to a
[16:32] place he he stayed with the people
[16:34] because you get to know the people
[16:35] better you know you get to know the
[16:38] people well and and get to interact with
[16:40] them and and man you know it's like
[16:42] brother branham said when he walked in
[16:43] that colored lady's home over there and
[16:45] or wasn't miss somewhere in Mississippi
[16:48] or Memphis he said I've been in castles
[16:51] he said but that woman he said that
[16:54] woman he said you thought about feeling
[16:56] the presence of God so it really doesn't
[16:58] matter if it's a row house or our castle
[17:02] or doesn't matter to me as long as the
[17:03] people are Christians and Christians as
[17:05] opposed to act different anyway so
[17:06] they're not gonna treat you wrong but
[17:09] but just pray for us we're leaving
[17:11] Thursday but we'll we'll have a service
[17:13] Wednesday night to kind of give you a
[17:16] little idea what's what we're gonna do
[17:18] while we're over there we'll have a real
[17:20] tight itinerary last time I went you
[17:23] know went for three weeks and they gave
[17:25] me a couple days in between didn't rest
[17:27] and relax and not this time we're gonna
[17:30] hit the ground running and I think they
[17:32] might be one day that we're not gonna
[17:33] have anything to do so we're going to be
[17:36] flying to to the island of Palawan for
[17:40] three days and we'll have a big
[17:41] ministers meeting there and bring all
[17:42] the ministers in and it's best to do
[17:46] that that way you can't go over there
[17:48] three days on an island and try to
[17:50] preach it every place but if you can
[17:51] bring all 30 or so preachers to one spot
[17:54] and have ministers meeting they can
[17:57] maybe catch a revelation between each
[17:59] other and all of us being there and then
[18:01] they can go back and preach to their
[18:02] people because it's great to have an
[18:04] American it's great to have a foreigner
[18:06] and it's great to have a foreigner here
[18:08] but you know what it's not like sitting
[18:11] here and listening and every Sunday to
[18:12] brother Dale and some
[18:13] and the minister's preaching the Word of
[18:15] God you get more from that it's really
[18:18] nice and exciting to have somebody new
[18:20] but sometimes you say well what they
[18:21] preach and you say well I don't know so
[18:24] I hope you don't say that with me and
[18:25] brother Dale but I'm not gonna ask don't
[18:28] don't raise your hand let's go to the
[18:30] book of Revelation revelation 6 verse 12
[18:39] yeah that's the tribulation okay all
[18:41] right let's bow our heads and get
[18:43] started les Nesta Lord to be with us
[18:45] today
[18:45] Lord Jesus we pray Lord that you would
[18:47] come among us today in a way Lord of
[18:52] Revelation of comfort to the people as
[18:57] we were meditating on this morning that
[19:02] Satan has got us a full of all these
[19:04] fears and anxieties and we're worried
[19:07] about this and worried about that that's
[19:10] what he wants you to do you want you to
[19:13] just worry but Lord Jesus you know you
[19:17] said wherever you went fear not and
[19:20] today I say fear not little flock
[19:22] because this the father's good pleasure
[19:25] for us to be in the exact place we're in
[19:27] right now and that's not fear about
[19:31] what's going to happen
[19:32] with Lord let's look to you the author
[19:34] and finisher of our faith
[19:37] you started the work and you're going to
[19:39] finish it father we pray that you'd be
[19:41] with us be with the sick among us be
[19:43] with the ones that are traveling Lord
[19:45] it's raining really hard now outside we
[19:47] pray that you just be with us on the
[19:48] highways take care of each one forgive
[19:51] us of our sins and bless us today Lord
[19:53] as we continue to open the word Lord and
[19:55] see the great and wonderful mighty
[19:58] things that you have for us Lord just be
[20:00] with the missionaries in the foreign
[20:02] fields give them fruit for their labor
[20:03] father pray that you just specially
[20:05] bless the ones Lord that are there in
[20:07] the Philippines as we're heading in that
[20:09] direction Lord that you would just be
[20:10] with them Lord give them comfort bless
[20:12] them in Jesus name Amen and I beheld
[20:15] when opened the sixth seal and there was
[20:17] a great earthquake and the Sun became
[20:18] black as sackcloth of hair and the moon
[20:20] became his blood the stars of heaven
[20:22] fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
[20:24] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[20:26] shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven
[20:28] departed as a scroll when it rolled
[20:29] together and every mountain and island
[20:31] was moved out of their places and the
[20:32] kings of the earth and the great men and
[20:34] the rich men and the chief captains and
[20:36] the mighty men and every bondman and
[20:37] every free man hid himself in the dens
[20:40] and the rocks of the mountains I said to
[20:42] this to the mountain and rocks fall on
[20:44] us and hide us from the face of him that
[20:45] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[20:47] of the lamb for the great day of his
[20:48] wrath has come and who shall be able
[20:52] to stand you may be seeing the Lord as
[20:53] blessings reading the word we're going
[20:54] to just kind of be abbreviated today but
[20:57] I wanted us to see that this on our
[21:00] first quote and last Sunday I hope you
[21:04] enjoyed what we were trying to say
[21:07] they're kind of piggybacking on what
[21:08] brother Dale and then this morning also
[21:10] about what what he was saying on the on
[21:15] the feast days and all the treatment of
[21:17] the Jubilee and all those things because
[21:19] it does have something remember there
[21:22] and where is it in if somewhere in the
[21:24] Bible in the New Testament said all
[21:25] these things were given an example for
[21:27] an example because the Old Testament is
[21:29] an example we're not to live the life of
[21:31] Moses perfectly we'd have to kill an
[21:35] Egyptian we can't live the same life of
[21:39] Sampson from one end to the other
[21:40] because it was a womanizer see what I'm
[21:42] saying but God used them for certain
[21:44] pieces of things that we can see that we
[21:47] can use for examples to whom the end of
[21:51] the worlds come up on so it's just for
[21:52] you and I to look back into the Old
[21:54] Testament and not live just like Moses
[21:56] not live you ought to live like Christ
[21:59] Christ is one that's inside you helping
[22:02] you live it out the problem with Moses
[22:04] and some of those other ones in the Old
[22:05] Testament Christ wasn't living inside of
[22:07] them they were anointed by God to do the
[22:11] work they were supposed to do but they
[22:13] were not sons and daughters from God
[22:14] they are not sons and daughters of God
[22:16] and never will be sons and daughters are
[22:17] done you and I are sons and daughters of
[22:20] God amen so we have a idea we do have a
[22:23] special appointment in the morning we
[22:25] have a place that that not many people
[22:28] have we are able to do as we were
[22:30] talking in the Bible study last night we
[22:33] we have inside of us God
[22:38] and inside of us is God Almighty and in
[22:41] your flesh and that makes you a son and
[22:47] daughter of God
[22:47] it makes you God made manifest in
[22:50] another form called a bride he has him
[22:52] more feed into you to make you god
[22:56] almighty in human flesh that's what he
[22:58] said and then that's your part and these
[23:03] seals are not given down through the
[23:05] church ages these things were sealed up
[23:08] until right now
[23:10] until this day until this hour until
[23:13] this when you're sitting here today when
[23:15] we're sitting in service we are under
[23:17] the anointing of that headstone message
[23:20] the breaking of the seals and not just
[23:23] to break them because it was wonderful
[23:25] to break the seals when brother Branham
[23:27] was there working under one of the
[23:29] greatest anointing that ever worked
[23:30] under of course nobody got it but that
[23:32] was that was scripture being made
[23:34] manifest because the Bible in
[23:38] Revelations 5 the lamb took the book and
[23:40] open and broke the seals he had to break
[23:42] them but he had to break them through
[23:43] somebody he had to have a prophet on the
[23:46] earth to break the seals through but now
[23:49] is he the total only recipient of it you
[23:53] and I are the recipient of it you and I
[23:56] are the total recipient of it Jesus
[23:58] Christ did not die on the cross for
[24:00] himself he died for us brother Branham
[24:05] coming brought a message for us it
[24:08] wasn't for the people that were sitting
[24:09] there and the fulfillment wasn't for him
[24:13] it was for him to break the seal and
[24:15] then hand it to the people for the angel
[24:19] in revelations 5 to take that book and
[24:21] say John take this book and eat it
[24:23] he didn't take you from a seventh angel
[24:26] messenger hand he took you from the
[24:28] mighty angels hand amen not saying
[24:31] brother Brian didn't have anything to do
[24:32] with it but in the days of the voice of
[24:33] seventh angel when he shall sound the
[24:36] message will be made clear and then John
[24:40] and know what to do when he gets the
[24:41] book John knows they eat the book John
[24:45] says give me the book and he took it
[24:47] from the hand of the mighty angel he
[24:50] didn't take it from the seven
[24:51] angel messenger the seventh angel
[24:52] messenger was a messenger he brought a
[24:55] message and now you and I are the
[24:58] recipients of that message all right so
[25:00] we've got try our best to live by that
[25:03] part not that we're all going to be
[25:05] prophets we can't all be preachers but
[25:10] we all have our part and your parts just
[25:13] as important as anybody else's part the
[25:15] man brother Branham why why in the world
[25:17] did he just come here and just preach
[25:20] 1,100 some sermons and then he left the
[25:22] scene and then nothing happened
[25:25] God don't do that God never said I
[25:29] should have sent somebody else cause he
[25:30] would have been more clear no he sent
[25:32] the exact person that should have sent
[25:34] he said the exact words for us to hear
[25:36] so that somebody will get it
[25:38] amen so he sent brother Branham because
[25:42] of his character he give he eat he
[25:44] didn't protect brother Branham he
[25:45] protected the gift that was on brother
[25:47] Branham he protected that part because
[25:49] that gift was for me and you that's what
[25:52] this is this is my gift from God that
[25:54] was handed to me by seventh angel
[25:56] messenger he handed me this message and
[26:01] I'm talking about the verbal part the
[26:03] verbal part now Jordan jaw on top of the
[26:06] bride took the book from the mighty
[26:07] angel but who was the mighty angels my
[26:09] name's will come down through brother
[26:11] Branham and said here this is for you
[26:13] this is your book it's not my book is
[26:16] your book and mancubs it was a book of
[26:18] you it's not the book of you you're in
[26:22] the book without the names in this book
[26:25] it's just a ends and these and bites and
[26:28] then you read this Bible it you take all
[26:30] the names out and you've got nothing
[26:31] it's just gibberish really it is it's
[26:33] just a ends and these and buts and went
[26:36] here take your name out and try to read
[26:37] that you can't take take he take
[26:40] anything compared to a person if you
[26:43] just read it's hard to understand but
[26:45] when you put a person in there that's
[26:48] what you and I need to understand we
[26:49] need to understand that you are the
[26:51] person that God is talking about he's
[26:54] talking about you and to you in this
[26:56] Bible right here and then we come up
[26:58] here to the end time and you said well
[27:00] we're just we're nothing no we are we
[27:02] are it this is it this is
[27:05] nice thing about that this weekend and
[27:07] I'm gonna probably use it some over in
[27:11] the Philippines because like we always
[27:13] said it I don't want you to get caught
[27:15] in when I say who's gonna take a rapture
[27:17] you say I am it's not you the person you
[27:20] it's you the person you've become you
[27:23] become God made manifest in another form
[27:26] called the bride he said that and he's
[27:29] the one that's gonna take a rapture but
[27:31] it's true you you're going if you're if
[27:34] he's inside of you then who's gonna take
[27:36] a rapture I am alright so you go to the
[27:39] I am and I think I'm gonna maybe use
[27:41] that a little bit maybe maybe a little
[27:44] bit it's just the way the Lord's been
[27:45] leading I don't know if it's too strong
[27:46] formal wahby shouldn't be somebody's
[27:48] gonna have to say I come from God I'm
[27:52] going back to God amen we were talking
[27:54] about this morning down to Sunday school
[27:56] class you know Jesus stood there and he
[27:58] said I came from a certain place and
[28:00] Here I am now I'm going back to that
[28:04] certain place because I'm not going to
[28:05] be the son of man through the church
[28:07] ages anymore I'm going back to God
[28:09] I'm gonna come in the form of the Holy
[28:11] Ghost through seven Church ages but for
[28:14] a little while I got to come back and
[28:16] gather the harvest the son of man's the
[28:19] sword the seed the son of man sends the
[28:22] Reapers but the son of man standing
[28:23] there when the harvest is brought forth
[28:26] Boaz the type of Christ he was what he
[28:28] was a man he was a man that collected to
[28:33] harvest and that's what's going to do in
[28:34] the end time the son of man's got to
[28:37] come back and collect to harvest the
[28:39] human flesh all of us the son of man
[28:42] ministry are the headship of the word
[28:45] which the headship are these seals that
[28:47] we're talking about do you want to know
[28:48] what headship the headship that was lost
[28:51] down through the church ages it's what
[28:54] we're talking about right now we're
[28:56] talking about what was left off through
[29:00] all the other church ages tonight and
[29:02] today we're talking about exactly what
[29:06] God had in his mind he saw it and he saw
[29:09] people there that would take it so
[29:11] that's got to be me and you okay but
[29:14] there's a place that we're not going to
[29:16] go to we're not going to go through this
[29:17] - what we're talking about today we're
[29:18] going to talk about
[29:19] the Tribulation Period because the sixth
[29:21] seal opens for the Tribulation Period
[29:23] all right and you and I are not included
[29:26] I was looking up quotes the other day
[29:28] because remember most of your church
[29:30] people church denomination believe
[29:33] you're going to go through some form of
[29:34] tribulation
[29:35] whether it be three and a half years
[29:37] minor three and heavy earth major you're
[29:38] gonna go through seven years of
[29:39] tribulation they get that out of the
[29:42] Bible without revelation without
[29:45] revelation but now with revelation we
[29:47] know that even brother Branham the very
[29:50] analogy he used was that Joseph married
[29:53] a Gentile and then when he when he told
[29:58] the his brethren which were the Jews
[30:01] when he told them who he was he had
[30:03] already dismissed his Gentile bride into
[30:05] the palace and that's always been in the
[30:08] Bible but nobody but brother Branham was
[30:10] able to pull that out and say hey you
[30:14] don't go to any tribulation
[30:16] there's no tribulation for the bride I
[30:18] told you but the greatest revelation if
[30:21] I never get another one I know one thing
[30:22] for sure if I'm born again today I will
[30:25] not stand in the tribulation wrath of
[30:28] God and then I'm going in rapture amen
[30:31] then you should be happy about that too
[30:33] because around the world the
[30:36] denominations you put you send them down
[30:38] and say alright we're gonna go through
[30:40] the triple yeah we might go through the
[30:41] tribulation we got you know we got a lot
[30:43] of cleansing to do no you accept what
[30:46] God's already done Christ went to
[30:51] tribulation for us when he died on the
[30:53] cross I didn't bring the quote with me
[30:55] but brother Branham was using it in the
[30:57] sixth seal of how when Jesus died what
[31:02] happened earthquake
[31:03] son went down all these things happen
[31:06] almost parallel what happened to the
[31:08] sixth seal he said see there there's God
[31:10] delivering his son and all these things
[31:13] happen
[31:14] Moses when God delivered his children
[31:16] out of Israel that's what happened all
[31:18] these things to nature and then he said
[31:21] look here now you've got a 144,000
[31:23] that's getting ready to be delivered and
[31:25] the same thing is going on but now what
[31:28] happens to me and you all
[31:29] was natural for Jesus that was natural
[31:32] for Moses in Egypt that's going to be
[31:34] natural for 144,000 you and I are going
[31:38] to get it spiritually our tribulation is
[31:42] right now thank God our tribulation is
[31:47] now we get a spiritual tribulation not a
[31:51] natural physical tribulation oh sure we
[31:54] might and I think what are y'all doing
[31:57] setting up here man okay good to see
[32:01] good see Tony an extra with us today on
[32:04] the fourth row I looked over I'd see him
[32:08] but sister Esther said she was asking
[32:10] about being physically bereft we were
[32:12] talking about that last night in the
[32:13] Bible study will you have to look up
[32:15] that word BER EFT which is a derivative
[32:17] of bereaved but bereft means to be
[32:21] something taken away from you that
[32:22] you're in other words air conditioning
[32:25] heating being physically bereft the
[32:28] Prophet said would mean that we're going
[32:30] to these things going to be comforts
[32:31] going to be taken away from us that we
[32:34] have now that we won't have then that's
[32:37] being physically bereft now I don't know
[32:39] I'm not gonna say this just to us death
[32:41] nobody but me I don't think we're going
[32:44] to be like the martyrs and be drug apart
[32:46] and because there's laws in courts and
[32:49] things that's even the horrible as the
[32:52] court system is you can at least plead
[32:54] your case here in in the United States
[32:56] you can plead your case over there in
[32:58] the dark ages they just said oh you're a
[33:00] you're a Christian you know put a put of
[33:03] oxen on one end of him and an oxen on
[33:05] the other end and pull them apart you
[33:06] know they didn't care there wasn't no
[33:07] they were the judge jury and executioner
[33:09] but with being physically bereft doesn't
[33:12] mean I don't think like you said we're
[33:13] not going to be putting stocks but I
[33:15] think we might have to miss a meal we
[33:17] might have to not be things that we
[33:19] can't get together is what we were
[33:20] talking about last night we might not be
[33:22] able to get together that's why that
[33:23] it's important to pack the word in now
[33:27] where you don't have to say
[33:31] wait a minute you pray to brother Dale
[33:34] the prays to brother brown the prays to
[33:36] God to get you something
[33:37] now that's Catholic that's what they get
[33:39] that's they're praying to somebody if
[33:41] we're praying somebody to get something
[33:44] you pray to God and God answers your
[33:49] prayer Bible says you say to this
[33:52] mountain be removed and let me be carnal
[33:55] you say to this porkchop land on my
[33:57] plate hey man hey man yeah I'm porkchop
[34:03] I ain't bad is it I could have said just
[34:06] a piece of bread but you know what
[34:08] though that's what's going to happen but
[34:09] you got to come to a place that God can
[34:11] work in your life because power without
[34:14] character satanic power that kind of
[34:17] power if you had that kind of power what
[34:19] would you do if you weren't really a
[34:21] true solid born-again believer there's a
[34:22] lot of things you could do that we're
[34:24] wrong and God would have to honor it
[34:28] because he did with Elijah Elisha was
[34:29] the prophet of God somebody made him ill
[34:32] and he called to she-bears to eat the
[34:35] foot now that wasn't God and that didn't
[34:36] have anything to do with God but God
[34:38] honored what the Prophet said all right
[34:40] so he's gonna honor what you say but
[34:42] power with character is fit to have that
[34:44] porkchop if you need it or have that
[34:46] piece of bread if you need it or have
[34:48] that brother Lewis like over and look at
[34:51] that you all around the world the
[34:53] brother needed oil in his car
[34:55] you saw all that's just so simple no
[34:58] that's God Donny will tell you there is
[35:02] no known case in the United States and
[35:04] around the world that a car has been out
[35:06] of oil and all of a sudden you put the
[35:08] dipstick back in and it's full would you
[35:12] think even if it was sitting way on the
[35:15] side you could say well this sitting way
[35:17] over here and it couldn't get no
[35:18] somebody will get to the dipstick but
[35:20] for it to be out and then all of a
[35:22] sudden be full brother Harris needed all
[35:24] needed gas one time and remember he run
[35:26] out of gas and he prayed that thing it
[35:28] filled it up with gas well who did
[35:32] Texaco it Havilland come by the
[35:36] Havilland man come by and put oil in
[35:38] that car
[35:38] no God Almighty sent an angel by with a
[35:42] can of oil
[35:43] poor nothing in there and it was done
[35:46] and it wasn't just a little heating you
[35:49] how many quarts to bring he knew what he
[35:52] wanted my to like car what truck was so
[35:54] he brought five quarts of all but you
[35:56] see what I meant that's power with
[35:58] character though it's did not ask for
[36:01] everything in the world but ask for that
[36:03] what you need of and that's what's going
[36:05] to happen to you and I I believe as we
[36:09] continue on I don't think we're going to
[36:11] be like I said now now when the
[36:14] tribulation when this tribulation starts
[36:15] they're gonna be hunted down like dogs
[36:17] brother branham said they'll be hunted
[36:18] and killed for what they believe because
[36:21] what's going to happen is you and I are
[36:22] still living under the Holy Ghost but
[36:26] you got to remember when we leave this
[36:28] place that's not just a minor
[36:30] tribulation that's the wrath of God
[36:33] that's going to be poured out it'll be a
[36:35] godless nation a godless group of people
[36:38] and almost a godless world except for
[36:40] the 144,000 and the foolish virgin that
[36:43] are trying to you know write the thing
[36:46] back up again but they're the ones
[36:47] that's going to get killed because why
[36:50] because they're under the tribulation
[36:52] they will have to go through that
[36:53] cleansing but when you and I get born
[36:56] again thank God Almighty in heaven you
[36:59] don't have to go to a tribulation we're
[37:03] going through it now we're going through
[37:06] it now you say well I yeah we're going
[37:08] through it now we've got $50,000 cars
[37:10] and $200,000 houses we're going through
[37:13] some real bad now what's going on
[37:14] between your head is your battleground
[37:18] Satan does not care how big your car is
[37:21] or how little your car is but if he can
[37:24] get in your mind he has won the battle
[37:26] so there's the problem is right here so
[37:30] that's the police oh what we got to do
[37:32] we got to feed it in the word so that
[37:34] it'll drive that out because look if
[37:37] you're born again you're not going to be
[37:39] driving unclean spirits out of your soul
[37:41] that's a clean spirit that's the Holy
[37:44] Ghost inside but that second person that
[37:48] second realm is what we're dealing with
[37:49] the spirit realm the memory reason
[37:52] conscience effects an imagination we're
[37:54] all that debt where the demons just
[37:55] travel back and forth and that's your
[37:57] true
[37:57] relation I told them I said look when we
[37:59] get a body change you're not gonna have
[38:01] to worry about praying praying is over
[38:06] you're not gonna worry about redemption
[38:08] redemption over for you not for the
[38:11] world now but for you Redemption is over
[38:14] we're not gonna go to heaven and be
[38:16] praying for people we do it now
[38:18] fervently pray for people pray the
[38:21] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[38:23] availeth much but if you aren't gonna
[38:25] need it in the future home it'll be done
[38:27] away with and I am NOT gonna get into
[38:30] where we're supposed to get now let's
[38:31] get back aaron sitting back there bless
[38:36] his heart i won't want to miss rabbit
[38:38] trail howl ooh you said so now let's go
[38:44] to the first quote i'm just glad that i
[38:48] don't have to go through the tribulation
[38:49] cuz lid let me say one more time you
[38:51] talk to Memphis Baptists and all the
[38:53] different ones they're looking for a
[38:55] tribulation to happen in their life
[39:00] and then get saved now that's not God
[39:03] the devil's telling them that but we
[39:07] know once we're boarding in the
[39:10] tribulation just slides away
[39:12] that's why brother Branham was talking
[39:14] about on the when he was wanting to
[39:16] preach on the seven trumpets seven
[39:19] trumpets are not to us the seven
[39:21] trumpets are to Israel which are the
[39:23] wolves and the vials and the plagues you
[39:25] and I don't see these plagues you and I
[39:28] don't see the hairy men and the
[39:30] scorpions and all that we don't see that
[39:32] we're gone we're in another dimension
[39:35] waiting on God to clean this thing off
[39:37] so that the new earth can come forth and
[39:40] we can come and live on it amen so the
[39:42] sixth seal is the Tribulation Period so
[39:45] as soon as we leave this place that's
[39:46] what takes place the bride's gone
[39:48] there's no living creatures nothing
[39:49] there to say God's not dealing with the
[39:51] church no more so we're gone he's
[39:53] dealing with Israel this is the other
[39:55] side this is when Israel receives the
[39:56] message of the kingdom by the two
[39:58] prophets of revelations 11 remember
[40:00] Israel is a nation God's servant nation
[40:02] and when he was brought in it'll be a
[40:03] national affair Israel the kingdom ages
[40:06] were David the son of David sits on the
[40:08] throne so that's what that's what we've
[40:10] been talking about even when we jump
[40:13] through the tribulation period over into
[40:15] the Millennium that's still not to us
[40:17] we're just there on a honeymoon that's
[40:19] to a promise that David is going to set
[40:23] on the throne and there's going to be
[40:24] twelve tribes of Israel around it we
[40:27] read last night in Ezekiel 14 through 48
[40:30] and all through there the Millennial
[40:31] temple has nothing to do with us we
[40:33] don't need a temple you are the Temple
[40:35] of the Holy Ghost you are the temple of
[40:37] God and then you're the anointing to the
[40:39] temple they're going to build in the
[40:41] Millennium and you and I are going to
[40:43] live there
[40:44] okay so that even in the Millennium
[40:46] we've we really don't have to do
[40:48] anything once we take a body change and
[40:50] step over another dimension brothers and
[40:52] sisters it's over it's over for us the
[40:55] strut actually the struggling should now
[40:57] start being over now
[41:03] you you you temporarily have a body
[41:07] change working right now inside of you
[41:11] that inside man is 20 years old encased
[41:14] by whatever age you are okay that's a
[41:18] paradox but once that inside man takes
[41:21] over and you let him take over then
[41:24] everything's gonna be done everything's
[41:26] gonna be finished
[41:27] hey man you say why it's too simple well
[41:29] that's just what if it's not anything we
[41:32] don't have to we don't have to go
[41:34] through tribulation we don't have to
[41:35] listen to to prophets we don't have to
[41:36] be hunted down like dogs we don't have
[41:38] to be worried about a nuclear bomb
[41:41] falling on us we're not gonna worry
[41:42] about an earthquake where it swallows up
[41:44] everybody we're not going to worry about
[41:46] that see to me that worry is good enough
[41:49] right now for me just to not worry about
[41:51] that sure than you you know you worry
[41:53] about your kids getting in before the
[41:55] for the door shuts and you worry about
[41:57] this that's okay but do not worry about
[41:59] you if you're sealed in now you need to
[42:03] worry about if you're not but if you
[42:04] have the new birth you're sealed in to
[42:06] the day of your redemption amen
[42:09] cozy look even in these seven seals we
[42:12] must see and we'll get to this when we
[42:14] get back from the Philippines we'll
[42:15] start with this this is the seal part
[42:18] but if if Israel gets is born again into
[42:23] the tribulation or in the 144,000 get
[42:26] received a new birth in that tribulation
[42:29] burst them and then you've got Jesus
[42:31] with this tribulation natural Moses with
[42:33] his might and yours has to be a
[42:35] spiritual revelation it has to be a
[42:37] spiritual tribulation we're all nature
[42:40] our nature listen our nature is when
[42:44] we're born we're dead everybody in this
[42:47] building was born the exact same way it
[42:50] came from the exact same place by the
[42:52] exact same height and we're going to a
[42:56] place called the grave if we don't take
[42:59] a body change so that's your nature
[43:02] that's the nature we're all built with
[43:05] as we get as the young ones like you got
[43:07] two nice-looking show the camera two two
[43:09] nice-looking brothers right here yeah
[43:12] there you go - good
[43:14] you
[43:14] what they don't get up in the morning
[43:15] and go I'm done but when you get move
[43:23] over to this side of the church in this
[43:29] row when you move over here though
[43:33] brother Dale and brother Donny have a
[43:35] little bit different thought process
[43:37] than these two guys do basically early
[43:39] in the morning I mean listen you
[43:42] remember when you could you can sleep on
[43:43] concrete at this age concrete never move
[43:47] and get up and go bad I feel good let's
[43:50] go do it at about 59 doing it their age
[43:58] it take a crane with a moving crew to
[44:03] get them up off concrete but they just
[44:06] get up and go but seat so the mentality
[44:08] I like to keep telling sister Cletus
[44:10] she's oldest one in the building she's
[44:12] older in the building
[44:13] she's always win the building she is
[44:15] closer to her 20 year old and not than
[44:17] we are if you start thinking that way
[44:20] what is that that's a total disruption
[44:22] of the nature that you've been given
[44:26] because the nature you've been giving is
[44:29] I'm gonna live I'm gonna work I'm gonna
[44:30] have kids I'm gonna die and that's
[44:35] probably about 100 percent correct all
[44:38] over the world there's no exception to
[44:41] that right but we've got to come to a
[44:44] 6-cell purging where that sanctification
[44:47] comes and it tells us that nature is not
[44:50] going to happen that nature has to be
[44:53] disrupted to where I'm not going toward
[44:56] a grave I'm going toward a change amen
[45:00] so that's what we're heading toward but
[45:03] we got to get this natural part out of
[45:04] the way all right let's go to number two
[45:08] well we know that the sixth seal is the
[45:10] judgment seal it's the judgment seal
[45:13] exactly what it is
[45:15] now see we've had an antic ox rights in
[45:17] the church go now finish goes up then we
[45:20] see the martyrs of the Jews back there
[45:21] under the altar here's the breaking
[45:23] fourth of the judgment upon the people
[45:24] we're out of this tribulation judgment
[45:27] will come forth 144,000 redeem Jews I'll
[45:32] prove that there's usually not Gentiles
[45:33] we know that and have nothing to do with
[45:35] the bride nothing at all for the sixth
[45:37] seal is the judgment seal of the word so
[45:40] see we get everybody has to come to a
[45:43] judgment everybody
[45:47] he said well you just said we were
[45:50] judged through Christ so he had to come
[45:52] to a judgment but even we have a
[45:54] judgement of the deeds done in the body
[45:56] whether good or bad we have the little
[45:58] things that we have to deal with because
[46:00] that fallen nature is so bad but when
[46:03] you take a body change folks brothers
[46:05] sisters look at me when you take a body
[46:07] change who can condemn me a sin who can
[46:10] convince me of sin I don't have no sin
[46:15] you should believe that now we have sins
[46:19] but we don't have the sin that's gonna
[46:23] take us to hell
[46:24] amen but even those sins will be done
[46:28] away with once we get a glorified body I
[46:31] mean what else are we doing what sure we
[46:33] may have to pass through a little bit of
[46:35] a judgment of we'd wronged our brother
[46:38] or something but nothing compared to
[46:40] what's happening on this earth nothing
[46:43] compared there will be nothing think of
[46:46] the think of the destruction and chaos
[46:48] that's gonna happen when we're out of
[46:50] here
[46:51] amen so now watch even Isaiah 13 verse 6
[46:57] Isaiah says how you for the day of the
[46:59] Lord is at hand you shall come as a
[47:01] destruction from the Almighty there
[47:03] force y'all All Hands B Fane and every
[47:05] man's heart shall melt that's the sixth
[47:08] seal and they shall be afraid pains and
[47:12] sorrows shall take hold of them they
[47:14] shall be in pain as a woman that
[47:16] travaileth they shall be amazed at one
[47:19] another
[47:20] their faces shall be as flames behold
[47:24] the day of the Lord cometh cruel both
[47:26] with wrath and fierce anger to lay the
[47:28] land desolate 6 sealed deals with the
[47:34] land Nature land desolate and he shall
[47:38] destroy the sinners thereof out of it
[47:41] where the stars of heaven in the
[47:42] constellations therefore shall not give
[47:44] their light the Sun shall be darkened in
[47:47] this going forth and the moon shall not
[47:49] cause her life to shine now that's we
[47:51] just read the sixth seal sixth seal
[47:54] verse thirteen started having fell into
[47:55] earth even as a fig tree casteth said
[47:57] and finally untimely fruits the heaven
[47:59] departed as a scroll when it rolled
[48:00] together same thing here in Isaiah
[48:02] because remember Isaiah as a total
[48:03] commentary of the Bible alright for the
[48:06] stars of heaven in constellation there
[48:08] shall not give their light and the Sun
[48:09] shall be darkened that's going forth the
[48:11] moon shall not cause her light to shine
[48:12] and I will punish the world for their
[48:16] evil and the wicked for their iniquity
[48:18] and i will cause the arrogancy of the
[48:21] proud to cease and will lay low the
[48:23] haughtiness of the terrible words that
[48:26] write here verse fifteen and the kings
[48:27] of the earth and the great men the rich
[48:29] man chief captains mighty men every
[48:31] bondman and every free man hid
[48:32] themselves in the dens and the rocks of
[48:34] the mountains and said to the mountains
[48:35] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[48:37] him that sitteth on the throne
[48:39] that arrogant group of people God's
[48:42] going to bring them down but this is all
[48:44] during the Tribulation Period
[48:45] all right now let's look at number three
[48:47] see they're just exactly as I saw the
[48:50] same thing that Jesus spoke of that the
[48:52] seventh seal reveals when he's cleansing
[48:55] the land with tribulations
[48:57] that's the Tribulation Period this sixth
[48:59] seal did you see what I just read
[49:02] you might catch that Isaiah saw the same
[49:07] thing that Jesus spoke up that the
[49:09] seventh seal reveals he didn't say it
[49:11] was the seventh seal he said what the
[49:13] seventh seal reveals there's your key
[49:16] the seventh seal reveals every seal
[49:19] without the seventh seal you don't get
[49:21] any of the seal when he's cleansing the
[49:24] land with tribulation that's the
[49:26] Tribulation Period this sixth seal yes
[49:30] he was a prophet and the Word of God was
[49:32] made known to him all right so now let's
[49:35] read number four because what's gonna
[49:39] bring in thin just for information
[49:41] because he stopped by the remnant now
[49:44] remember as his analogy was you and I
[49:48] are not the remnant you and I are the
[49:50] piece of cloth you and I are the suit or
[49:53] whatever God's made you and I are that
[49:55] but there is when you when you when you
[49:58] cut out the goods there's a remnant
[50:00] there's pieces leftover but it's the
[50:03] same garment it's just not used for what
[50:06] it's used for all right that's the same
[50:08] thing with the the foolish virgin
[50:10] because remember the foolish virgins
[50:11] gonna be given eternal life for what
[50:12] they believe in what they see and what
[50:14] they profess they're gonna be given
[50:17] eternal life you and I just accept that
[50:20] before all this and it precedes any of
[50:22] this alright so not what is a remnant
[50:24] the piece that's cut left some kind of
[50:28] same kind of goods is that right you go
[50:32] cut your dress out of calico and you
[50:33] spread out a big piece of calico and you
[50:35] cut it out it's your business where you
[50:37] lay the pattern in other words he's
[50:38] explaining where we're God puts a
[50:39] pattern this is business it's God
[50:41] business business where he lays the
[50:43] pattern he cuts her right out is that
[50:45] right and now this rest of this calico
[50:47] left here is just as good a calico as a
[50:49] dress it's right right but it's God's
[50:52] election god he lacks his church God
[50:55] predestinate says Church God for
[50:58] ordained that ordains his church and he
[51:02] takes that church out and the remnant is
[51:05] left to go through the tribulation
[51:06] period all right now look I know but
[51:09] remember this that remnant that's going
[51:11] to be foolish virgin is not the 144,000
[51:16] these are brothers and sisters that have
[51:18] been blinded by false shepherds brother
[51:22] Branham said in one place it was I don't
[51:24] know if I got it in that one but he said
[51:26] it's the people we couldn't get to
[51:29] he was shaming us really is what he was
[51:32] doing he says the people we not getting
[51:34] to okay and that's where many Bible
[51:37] scholars today get mixed up thinking
[51:40] that the bride's over you're under in
[51:41] the tribulation fella said to me said I
[51:43] I couldn't tell you brother Branham say
[51:46] said I've seen the bride up in heaven
[51:48] the Dragons burnt and water out of his
[51:49] mouth to make war with the bride and the
[51:52] 144,000 which is the bride standing on
[51:54] Mount Sinai oh no no no no no brother
[51:58] Branson not me you got it all mixed up
[52:02] the brides in heaven now let me stop
[52:05] right here that's where brother Branham
[52:07] brings the quote in late before this
[52:10] where the bride leaves on Revelation 4:1
[52:13] and doesn't come back to revelations 19
[52:17] see it takes care of all of 4 5 6 7 8 9
[52:23] 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 8 all those
[52:27] chapters of tribulation time it's not to
[52:31] us we go up in for one after these
[52:35] things the door was opened in heaven
[52:36] says come up here there we go up into
[52:38] that open door but we get the spiritual
[52:41] part of every bit of it Amen why I said
[52:44] anything you talking about that
[52:46] tribulation anything we read about
[52:47] tribulation you can put it in your life
[52:50] that you be the went through or you're
[52:51] going through amen
[52:54] earthquake you have our acquaintance
[52:56] your house you kids never got mad at you
[53:03] call you a little kid a tornado
[53:05] why hello cyclone hurricane or Deana and
[53:14] OH see what I mean the ends in trouble
[53:18] she's outside but that's the parts you
[53:21] got you're going through now we're going
[53:22] through tribulation now we don't have to
[53:25] go through any of this natural stuff and
[53:26] the remnant of a woman's seed the bride
[53:29] isn't
[53:29] and the remnant of the woman's seed not
[53:31] her not the pattern the remnant was
[53:34] there and the persecution the Roman
[53:37] Empire when Catholicism will consolidate
[53:39] and they'll you not their powers
[53:40] together with the great Church it's like
[53:42] brother Joe Canada was talking about
[53:43] last night brother Graham told us over
[53:45] and over again
[53:46] do not worry about communism and all
[53:48] these other isms he said you worry about
[53:50] Romanism Romanism is the purple curtain
[53:54] is what's going to come down against us
[53:56] is that that's the policy I mean
[54:00] communism that's not gonna bother us but
[54:06] it's just what what bothers you most
[54:10] think about in your brain what bothers
[54:12] you most is it natural things or
[54:16] spiritual thing if you're born again
[54:19] spiritual things because you always got
[54:21] something in your head that's pounding
[54:24] for and against and what is this and
[54:26] what is that and right see there
[54:30] you still know it's builds up come on
[54:34] people please bill just means you can't
[54:37] handle your finances or the non-payment
[54:41] of them but spiritual things is what's
[54:46] gonna either follow with you or are you
[54:49] gonna get rid of them what drives you
[54:51] crazy brother branham many times he
[54:53] never hardly ever said anything about
[54:55] finances ring he would always say you
[54:57] got a spiritual problem even when the
[55:00] women were going through menopause and
[55:01] all these things he's you got a
[55:02] spiritual problem you've got things that
[55:04] make you nervous you got things to make
[55:05] well where is that that's on the inside
[55:07] that's not over here over here over here
[55:09] over here it's right here it's inside
[55:10] we're carrying these things with us we
[55:14] need to get rid of them because you know
[55:17] what it's just going to be a my new
[55:20] detail of what they're gonna go through
[55:21] naturally when we leave here amen so
[55:25] let's go to quote number five and then
[55:26] we're gonna read revelation and then
[55:28] we'll be finished
[55:31] vii says is on the seventh seal now 1963
[55:35] now we're at the end of the eagle let me
[55:37] come over here I'm sorry just huh now
[55:40] we're at the end of the eagle the
[55:41] revelation to be revealed the whole
[55:43] thing now compared this with revelations
[55:45] the tenth chapter verse one through
[55:47] seven we'll see here in this revelation
[55:48] here ten one through seven that in the
[55:51] days of the sounding of the seventh
[55:52] angels message was to finish up all the
[55:54] mysteries of God now we find out now
[55:56] what's this now we find out also in that
[55:59] is now we find out also in this that the
[56:04] sixth seal now being opened it was for a
[56:07] three-fold purpose alright and we'll
[56:11] cover this and then we'll cover back
[56:12] your three-hour threefold purpose when I
[56:14] come back from the Philippines because
[56:16] there's a three-fold purpose of the
[56:17] sixth seal there's a three-fold purpose
[56:19] of the seventh seal all right there by
[56:20] okay with that saying man wake up thank
[56:23] you
[56:25] now here was the purpose
[56:27] the first thing now the sixth seal is
[56:31] judgment seal tribulation seal and
[56:33] what's happening there's judgment being
[56:36] passed on a group of people in the earth
[56:38] right there's three folds to this now
[56:41] here was the purpose the first thing was
[56:44] that the sleeping virgin had to go
[56:45] through the tribulation period for
[56:47] purification that was a revelation under
[56:49] the sixth seal cuz there's a revelation
[56:51] under the seventh seal that you and I
[56:53] are already in heaven it was a
[56:54] revelation in the first seal that we
[56:56] were heading that way but look after the
[56:58] fourth seal were gone for sale were gone
[57:01] there's nothing mentioned of us we're
[57:02] not even here all right the first thing
[57:05] was that the sleeping version had to go
[57:07] through the tribulation period for
[57:08] purification she had to be purged of her
[57:11] sins of unbelief and rejecting the
[57:13] message this she was done in the
[57:16] tribulation period we see they wind up
[57:18] over in revelation 7 between the 6th and
[57:21] 7th chapter here that she had been
[57:23] purged and she had been given her robe
[57:25] now she's not the bride but it's the
[57:29] church the pure people that don't have
[57:32] the opportunity maybe to receive the
[57:34] message or in some way they were blinded
[57:36] by these false prophets and they didn't
[57:38] get a chance and yet they're really
[57:41] sincere in heart so that we were talking
[57:43] about last night listen
[57:44] don't knows your heart we were talking
[57:46] about the message to the 144,000 last
[57:48] night it's only going to be I'm sorry
[57:52] the fifth seals you the fifth seal Jew
[57:54] is not going to be some bank robbing
[57:55] whoremongering
[57:56] Jew no it's going to be somebody that
[58:00] God knows their heart
[58:01] God knew David's heart God newly inside
[58:06] of David and what he would do if he had
[58:08] the Holy Ghost and what he do if he
[58:10] wouldn't same way with the fifth seal
[58:12] Jew it's nothing to be ever scoundrel
[58:14] this a Jew it's going to be somebody
[58:17] that lives as close to jewelry jewelry
[58:19] not jewelry jewelry that they can like
[58:22] the pure Orthodox Jew the ones that live
[58:24] it that really try those are the ones
[58:26] that's going to be the fifth field you
[58:27] those are the ones he blinded he didn't
[58:29] blind Barabbas Barabbas was a murderer
[58:33] everybody got that so it's not every
[58:36] everybody in the it's not going to be
[58:37] included in the fifth seals
[58:39] God's not going to just what you think
[58:40] well that's great yeah it is great but
[58:42] it's great to those that God knew that
[58:44] would wound it that okay and man cuz God
[58:48] knows the heart the same way with this
[58:49] he knows that fifth I mean he knows that
[58:53] foolish virgins heart that if somebody
[58:57] would have got to that person and
[58:58] preached him the right message he or she
[59:00] would have got mourning in all right yes
[59:03] they were sincere and heart and God
[59:05] knows their heart and hear their purge
[59:07] during this time you notice that another
[59:10] purging time that this is the second
[59:12] fold
[59:12] that's for Israel when she gathers
[59:14] that's the second fold God purges Israel
[59:17] in the Tribulation Period out of the
[59:19] millions that gather there there'll be a
[59:22] select 144,000 and they will be purged
[59:25] also remember they got to be killed
[59:27] God's purging Israel notice this is
[59:31] number three notice here is a whole
[59:33] earth is to be purged there will be such
[59:36] a thing that the moon stars in all
[59:38] nature will be purged you see what it is
[59:41] the earth is renewing herself being
[59:44] purged getting ready for the Millennium
[59:47] alright the millennium is coming up and
[59:49] see everything that's got any felt on it
[59:51] is to be purged during the sixth seal so
[59:55] now when I get back we're going to
[59:57] heading toward you're purging you're
[1:00:01] going through a sick seal purging
[1:00:03] whether you like it or not you're gonna
[1:00:06] go through it cuz you're a child of God
[1:00:07] amen but you're not going through the
[1:00:11] natural amen
[1:00:14] you're not going through the natural all
[1:00:18] right let's read revelations 20 then
[1:00:20] we'll be done and I saw an angel come
[1:00:25] down from heaven having the keys of the
[1:00:26] bottomless pit and a great chain in his
[1:00:28] hand and he laid hold on the dragon that
[1:00:30] old serpent which is the devil and Satan
[1:00:33] and bound him a thousand years and cast
[1:00:35] him into the bottomless pit and shut him
[1:00:37] up and set a seal upon him that he
[1:00:38] should deceive the nation's No More till
[1:00:40] the thousand years should be fulfilled
[1:00:42] and after that he must be loosed a
[1:00:45] little season and I saw Thrones and they
[1:00:47] sat upon them and judgment was given
[1:00:49] unto them now this is coming up I'm
[1:00:51] moving forward just a little bit here
[1:00:53] because when I see Thrones that's you
[1:00:57] and me that's going toward the white
[1:01:00] throne judgment that's what that is and
[1:01:02] I saw Thrones and they sat upon them
[1:01:05] they and judgment was given unto them
[1:01:10] who's gonna judge the earth the Saints
[1:01:12] will judge the earth so it's me and you
[1:01:14] all right and I saw the souls of them
[1:01:17] will be headed for the witness of Jesus
[1:01:18] and for the word of God and which had
[1:01:20] not worshipped the Beast neither His
[1:01:22] image neither had received his mark upon
[1:01:24] their foreheads or in their hands and
[1:01:25] they lived and reigned with Christ a
[1:01:26] thousand years those are the only ones
[1:01:28] that's gonna live in the reign of Christ
[1:01:29] for a thousand years that kind of people
[1:01:32] because what but the rest of the Dead
[1:01:35] lived not again until the thousand years
[1:01:37] were finished see the foolish virgin
[1:01:38] that's going to be killed in the
[1:01:40] Tribulation Period are not going to come
[1:01:42] up there's no resurrection for them to
[1:01:45] come up in except the second
[1:01:46] resurrection they missed the first one
[1:01:49] so they got to come up in the second
[1:01:51] resurrection so as they die they've got
[1:01:53] to stay not dead but they gotta stand
[1:01:55] another dimension until the end of the
[1:01:58] end of the thousand years for their
[1:02:01] purification alright and shall reign
[1:02:03] with him a thousand years and when the
[1:02:05] thousand years are expired Satan shall
[1:02:07] be loosed out of this prison and shall
[1:02:09] go out to deceive the nations within the
[1:02:11] four
[1:02:11] quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to
[1:02:13] gather them together in the Bible the
[1:02:15] number whom is as the sand of the sea
[1:02:16] and they would upon the breadth of the
[1:02:18] earth and compassed the camp of the
[1:02:20] saints about in the beloved city and
[1:02:22] fire came from God out of heaven and
[1:02:24] devoured them and the devil that
[1:02:26] deceived him were cast into the lake of
[1:02:27] fire and brimstone where the beast and
[1:02:28] the false prophet are and shall be
[1:02:30] tormented day and night forever and ever
[1:02:31] we know that's not eternity that's gonna
[1:02:33] be for a length of time and they're
[1:02:34] gonna go away and I saw a great white
[1:02:38] throne and him that sat on it from whose
[1:02:40] face the earth and heaven fled away and
[1:02:42] there was found no place for them and I
[1:02:44] saw the dead here's what one worm was
[1:02:46] stopped here and I saw the dead small
[1:02:47] and great stand before God that's not us
[1:02:50] that's not us that's the people that
[1:02:55] just came up in the second resurrection
[1:02:57] that's the foolish virgin that's the cup
[1:03:01] of water in my name that's one's giving
[1:03:03] eternal life for being good to you
[1:03:05] because watch I am NOT ever gonna be
[1:03:09] judged now that I'm born again you'll
[1:03:11] never be judged by your own works you
[1:03:14] were judged by what Christ did this is
[1:03:17] not and I saw the dead small and great
[1:03:20] stand before God and the books were
[1:03:22] opened and another book was opened which
[1:03:23] is the book of life and the dead were
[1:03:25] judged out of those things which were
[1:03:28] written in the book according to their
[1:03:30] works
[1:03:31] not his works according to their works
[1:03:35] why because they had to go through a
[1:03:36] tribulation period they had to they had
[1:03:39] to be written in the book that they gave
[1:03:41] their life for the gospel that they held
[1:03:42] the gospel they knew right but not you
[1:03:45] and I you and I repeat the first part
[1:03:46] worse as I saw Thrones that's us that's
[1:03:53] us sitting at the white throne judgment
[1:03:57] judging the whole world but this seat
[1:04:02] seal comes up and brings a three-fold
[1:04:05] manner number one foolish virgin got to
[1:04:10] go through tribulation to give their
[1:04:12] life for the gospel that they hold the
[1:04:15] second fold is Israel 144,000 is going
[1:04:17] to come up out of that tribulation and
[1:04:19] be given eternal life the third fold is
[1:04:22] going to be this earth is going to be
[1:04:24] purged
[1:04:25] so that because remember Christ doesn't
[1:04:27] come back till the Millennium you and I
[1:04:29] don't come back to the Millennium I mean
[1:04:32] we only got glorified body around here
[1:04:33] just for a little while
[1:04:34] then we go over into another dimension
[1:04:36] to the marriage supper and then we come
[1:04:37] back Israel are the whoever you want to
[1:04:40] say 144,000 they're building the temple
[1:04:43] and all these things and you and I come
[1:04:44] in in the end of the millennium oh no
[1:04:46] not a redeemed entire member brother
[1:04:49] branham I want to tell you this one one
[1:04:51] thing read in the future home the
[1:04:54] Millennium in the future homes some
[1:04:55] things you can intertwine but then when
[1:04:58] you come to the future home it being
[1:05:01] eternal in the Millennium being in time
[1:05:03] it's totally separate there will be
[1:05:07] things in the Millennium they'll be in
[1:05:09] the future home but they will be things
[1:05:10] that happened in the Millennium that
[1:05:11] won't ever happen in the future home
[1:05:13] because during the Millennium you're
[1:05:14] still in that seventh day of time amen
[1:05:18] you're still in that seven seven is
[1:05:20] forty-nine you're still in that loop now
[1:05:22] we're not we already got our Jubilee s
[1:05:27] what brother that's right we're in our
[1:05:28] Jubilee now we've already accepted the
[1:05:32] fifty if you've went to Pentecost you
[1:05:35] have accepted your 50th Jubilee you're
[1:05:38] just waiting for your land to go free
[1:05:41] amen everything else is gone free you
[1:05:44] just waiting on the land to go free amen
[1:05:47] but the earth is still going through the
[1:05:50] seven sevens is 49 remembered there's no
[1:05:52] way Jesus could raised on Saturday
[1:05:55] because he didn't raised in the church
[1:05:58] age didn't raised in the Old Testament
[1:06:01] he raised on the eighth day which is the
[1:06:05] first day of the week he raised out of
[1:06:07] the church ages he raised out of the Old
[1:06:09] Testament he raised out of the seven
[1:06:12] sevens is 49 how in the world can you
[1:06:14] put God in a 49
[1:06:17] he's a fifty he's a eighth day so that's
[1:06:23] why he had to raise on the first day of
[1:06:25] the week he had to raise out of that
[1:06:27] seventh day couldn't raised on the
[1:06:29] seventh day he had to raise on the
[1:06:30] eighth day which is being the first day
[1:06:33] of the week
[1:06:38] and when you get born again guess what
[1:06:40] that jubilee comes to you if Christ is
[1:06:45] in that Jew he is the Jubilee but he
[1:06:47] stepped into the Jubilee when he come
[1:06:48] out of that tomb he stepped right into
[1:06:50] the Jubilee because his his land has
[1:06:54] been resting waiting on us for 2,000
[1:06:57] years he just didn't have no heartaches
[1:07:00] and trials when he stepped out of the
[1:07:01] tomb
[1:07:02] he said all power and heaven earth been
[1:07:04] given unto me I don't have to sleep
[1:07:06] anymore I don't have to eat less I won't
[1:07:09] - I don't need a wall I don't even need
[1:07:11] a door I'm not gonna ever be asleep on a
[1:07:17] boat again God's not I'm never gonna
[1:07:19] have to be put on the cross and have
[1:07:20] nailed foot in my hand I'm never gonna
[1:07:23] have to first I've done he was in the
[1:07:30] 8th day he had stepped out of that tomb
[1:07:33] right straight into eternity you did the
[1:07:36] same thing the day you accepted the new
[1:07:39] birth in your soul you entered into that
[1:07:41] eighth day you were raised he was the
[1:07:45] first fruit of the resurrection cuz you
[1:07:48] and I are what we're already raised in
[1:07:50] in heavenly places witnessed ain't
[1:07:51] believed it yet but you got to believe
[1:07:55] it and with this I believe with the
[1:07:58] sixth seal purging I believe you can
[1:08:01] because when it purges everything low
[1:08:03] when it purges everything who steps on
[1:08:05] the same God steps on the same when
[1:08:07] everything is purged remember he can't
[1:08:10] step down here in a physical form until
[1:08:12] the Millennium but that is when that's
[1:08:16] the purging of the knee and you hear me
[1:08:20] and you get purged under the sixth seal
[1:08:22] spiritual purging but the natural
[1:08:24] threefold purging of the sixth seal is
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:29] Phylis virgin 144,000 and the earth once
[1:08:34] those three things are done then who
[1:08:36] steps out Christ when you get finished
[1:08:39] with justification and sanctification of
[1:08:40] Baptism the whole goes who steps on the
[1:08:42] scene Christ Christ in human flesh mmm
[1:08:45] in a group called a bride it's been
[1:08:50] given to me in you we just got to do it
[1:08:52] hey man you love Lord let's stand our
[1:08:54] feet no we need that no just leave it
[1:09:01] there if anybody has the need we're
[1:09:03] gonna sing open the eyes of our heart
[1:09:07] just one time and if you have a need
[1:09:10] then we'll sit back down and finish what
[1:09:11] we're gonna finish won't take bit about
