========================================

God bless you Saints good to be back with you we got that AR arduous task out of the way Mary and Esther all so but we sure appreciate brother John for filling in last Sunday I sure appreciated that Sunday school message I listen I listen while I'm working in the in the yard or whatever and I that sure was a blessing let me see here let's get back maybe we might uh finish up kind of talking about Sunday uh serpent seed today we'll we'll see if we can get through some of these remaining slides but let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we ask Lord that you'll just bless us here this morning as we study these things out Lord God that you'll bless our study and bless uh Lord our hearts Lord as the people of gathered Lord that they'll come expecting to hear from you today Lord and that you'll just bless brother Wade as he's studying preparing for the Serv sermons today Lord grant it Lord that you'll just help us today we ask in your name amen now in the Ephesian Church age brother brand said speaking about this situation I got a little graveyard picture um you know I I I I I take a little effort to put these pictures in here because it really Nails home the point of of you know to things to think about that um the Adam made a decision here in in back in Genesis and the decision he made uh caused the uh you know ever you go through struggles in life and you you go through heartaches and sickness and people getting sick with cancer and struggling with illness and death and all those things and you can look back it all started from that from that decision of course it had to be that way you know everything was was ordained so that God's attributes could be manifested and so forth but let's see what brother BR said about in Ephesian church church age he said Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway and you see that's that's something to know that you're what you're doing is wrong but just to go and and and just step right over you see what what what Adam did is the thing in Adam the Bible says in Adam all die because Adam made that decision knowing that he was uh going the wrong path that he was accepting that what what his wife believed was wrong and what his wife had done was wrong she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself he would not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve for he loved her and so those two sons were born sons that would be the fathers of the human race that was even now polluted so we want to just this morning kind of examine how it got polluted and how to get unpolluted and that's why in Hebrews 11:4 it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice chist and Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead and by it he being dead yet speaketh oh let's just keep meditating on what faith is that faith that difference between Cain and Abel here Kaine had a good theology he understood a lot he'd been taught a lot but faith faith is I was listening the other day to Invisible Union and brother brandom just really Nails in faith is a revelation and all those things faith faith takes the uh the Theology and puts it together so you know what it is just like I I use an example you know we we quote many times where I I know what the first seal is because I can read where brother Ram said my revelation of the first seal is and he lays it out right there but do you know what it is like do you have a revelation of what it is and that applies all throughout the scripture we can read things about it but when God comes and reveals it to you it takes it to to a level where it like brother Dale used to use the example if you dump out all the parts on the floor of the car if you got if you understand you can put it back together cuz you know how it works you know and that's what faith is revelation that you know CU it come from God faith faith is a a something Supernatural that God gives you and I was I was reading the other day what brother brother Dale said in the seventh seal when he was preaching that about when when God you faith is such a supernatural thing that when God gives you a revelation and I'm just paraphrasing so y'all excuse me don't that when God gives you a re Revelation you know that God is with you because it's not something that you got from just reading and understand like reading a book of Shakespeare or something but God gave that to you so you know God is on the scene and that that should really I think that should help us all that it's not based on feelings or emotions or something but when God shows you something in the Bible and you can read and understand what that door in heaven was and the whole scene in Revelation 4 and the whole scene in Revelation 3 and you can understand these things that have been mysteries for years you know that God is on the scene so in the spoken word is Original Seed he said she got in a hurry Eve got in a hurry in in our trouble we want to we want to rush things and hurry things up and and and say we got it when we don't she got in a hurry and what did she do she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent seed and when she did she brought what did she bring she brought a child of death a child that now now listen to what kind of my my point my sticking point this morning is cuz there's I I want to look at some of the false doctrines and things things that the naysayers say about the message that they'll say well they say that they're just a little special group that because of if if you got the right lineage or whatever but look what brother R saying he said a child that she perverted every child after that now see that that just puts us all in one bucket that we all need a redeemer we all need a sacrifice we all need a blood covering there's not something special about some group or some other cuz we all have a soul that gives us the ability to go this way or that way we all have a soul that allows us to make a choice but we all were come come wrong because of what happened in the garden am now I if you can really see where I'm going this morning I wonder how get nervous hold on now it might be good to get get nervous cuz that'll that'll keep us awake and attentive and brother BR said in the Ephesian Church age he said then there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore Fallen man and make him a partaker of that life eternal once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know that it was no apple EV at it wasn't no apple no what what was it and I got see there's picture that really drive on the point of of a tree that's dead and a tree that's alive and you mix those two together and now you got what this picture that brother R was painting for us and as he preached the Ephesian Church age what it was it was the degr degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed so now that puts us all into one condition that we all need a savior and the invisible Union of the bride of Christ that sermon I was listening do the other night while I was working in the yard he said her body is given to her a sacred Trust From God no female dog no bird no other animal no other creature like that no she's the only one by she is the reason it's so sacred she is to bring forth life into the Earth her body is the beding grounds of life therefore that's the reason she has give this sacred trust oh you think about that that we've been given a sacred trust to bring forth the word of God that that you have the ability to choose uh left or right wrong or right right you got the ability to go in either direction now he said now here's where you may disagree many of you theologians that's what defile part of the human race no the whole human race that's what defil the whole human race is that adultery at the beginning her bedding ground was marred she brought forth those twins Cain and Abel one act two children search the scriptures one act two children now I I got kind of a rough a rough picture that you can see what what when E when eve took that lie of the of of the devil and mingled it with the truth of God's word well you can see here I got faith on the left unbelief on the right it polluted her the womb of her mind where she was unable to bring forth a a child the way that God had intended and he said now the womb Eve received the wrong seed word and that's in the spoken word is the Original Seed and he said and again the bride what muddy have become polluted Adam's bride now because she never stayed with God's word that right so it polluted mingling mingling two things mingling the truth and the false mingling right and wrong causes a polluted State oh you see you see why God told told them in the garden the day you eat thereof of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that day you die and that's the thing that mankind has been struggling to get back from ever since is to to to to come back to the full word which is why God gave us a prophit in this last day to restore the full word that's one of the greatest promises in the Bible and that Prophet that Prophet Joel prophesied that I will restore what he will restore the full word because one word off in the beginning caus death and if we restore back the forward if God brings us back to the forward then it will bring bring us back to that original condition where we are in in control of ourselves where we've got Temperance that we're in control and the patience of God and all those other things and that then that put puts us in a condition where we are able to speak the word and that we're able to bring us back right into the same condition that they were in where we're able to uh have control over ourselves and control over the create like brother R said we're Creator create an atmosphere you can create an atmosphere control over the atmosphere of your surroundings and so forth now you see the pollution she she accepted one word off uh she she believed one word off and it polluted the womb of her mind and it also polluted her natural womb you see where brother R said in Joseph meeting his brother he said the Bible said he was the most subtle of all the beasts not reptile of all the field he was the one who beguiled the woman in his Beauty and she conceived and now by doing that and seeing sin was coming God put such a curse upon him till science will never find any relationship between this serpent as known today and Mankind but there is your Fallen degraded being between that hooked the animal life together hooked it all together and now you can see uh Adam and Eve there on the left I put in yellow and and you You' take that Beast line on the right and before long you got like I got a little Melting Pot that before long you going to get it all Blended together like brother for example brother Aaron has been uh showing how that uh you know he's related to all these different people you start tracing your lineage back and you'll find out whoops I'm related to Elvis Presley whoops I'm related to uh uh somebody in history that uh killed a bunch of people or whatever you before long you get bount down to this one little family Noah's Ark that they were on the no on the ark and then and brother BR in one us he said man can find monkeys and chimpanzees chimpanzees and so forth but they can't find that link the link that what that connects man and Beast together there he is God cursed him so far he can't come back again that's on him for this evil act that he did he was the only seed that would mix make sure I'm on the right slide and brother Ram said in the Ephesian Church AG he said I want to go into some certain proof we have that there is a definite Affinity between man and an animal it is a physical thing and I got two cells there and we'll get into what Affinity means in just a second he said do you know that you can take the embryo cells from an unborn fetus and inject them into human beings then those thyroid cells will go right to the human thyroid the kidney cells will go right to the human kidneys do you realize how stupendous this is some intelligence guides those animal cells exactly to the right place that intelligence accepts those cells and puts them in exactly the right place there is an affinity between animal and man they can't intermingle and reproduce that has been tried but back in the garden that intermingling did take take place and the chemical Affinity which still exists proves it for back in Eden the serpent was an upright creature he was close to man he was almost man Satan took advantage of the Serpent's physical characteristics to use him to begal Eve then God destroy that pattern of the serpent no other Beast can co-mingle with man but the Affinity is there and Affinity means you take you take a liver cell and you put it in your bloodstream it's going to attract itself to the liver you take a what whatever kind of cell and you you you it's going to it's and and what he's saying here you can take one of those types of cells from an animal put it into a human and it's going to move toward that same kind of cell in a human because there's an affinity Affinity is the tendency of sales to adhere specifically to Sals of the same type but not to sales of a different type so brother man said in the spoken words is the original CD said she brought death through a bastard born child which we all are children of but God God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to original Sons and Daughters of God what am I what are you talking about this morning brother Bob I'm trying to say that like Paul said we have no confidence in the flesh I don't have confidence I don't have any confidence in where my natural lineage came from but what I have confidence in this morning is the lineage of Christ if I can get tapped into the new birth and get tapped into the eternal life of God that will override everything that that was messed up by the fall in the Garden of Eden that was messed up by the pollution of Eve's natural mind of the pollution of her mind that prevented her from being able to bring forth children the right way the pollution of her womb that was able that that would be able to bring forth a child in the way that God wanted to and just how everything just got all mixed up and mashed up you need to be born again you need to be born again because we were born wrong and we need to be born again not by man's ideas and man's thoughts and things but by the word of God God brother BR said if I can finish this quote he said God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to original Sons and Daughters of God see there you are the LIF sperm of Eve never happened it never did why she mingled it kept it away instead of adding Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like will would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised it now it this this kind of ties in together with a lot of Old Testament scriptures that that people use to refute Christianity and say well why would God say this in the Old Testament so I just want to briefly look at some of these like the because God was so against mixing the truth and fault mixing things up because you mix it up and you you can't bring it back to the original so in Deuteronomy chapter 22 it says Thou shalt not seow thy vineyard with diver seeds don't don't seow your vineyard with with let's say true and false lest the fruit of thy seed which thou has sown and the fruit of thy Vineyard you're be defiled don't plow your field with an ox and an ass together and you think well that doesn't make any sense but it makes sense in the context of what we're talking about how the degradation of humanity began because of mixing things up so God was so against mixing things up that he he even told the Israelites don't plow your field with an ox and an ass together just just if you're going to plow your field let them both be oxes or let them both be donkeys but but don't mix things up and don't don't even make a garment with different kind of fabrics don't make a garment with with uh polyester and a garment with cotton and because we want to keep things pure we want to we want to you mixing things up just messes everything up Thou shalt not wear a garment of divver sorts as of Woolen and linen together and brother R said and the meanest man I know he said not only have we hybred fruit animals but we've hybrid religion has to be babed and petted it's not the original we try to take the word of God and breed it into something else and breed it over here and it becomes a bunch of delicate babies that we have to baby and they T can't take the real word aren't you glad this morning that we're able to take the real word aren't you glad to be able to take a good gospel spanking or a good gospel scold that'll shape you up and mold you into a real genuine Christian that don't have to be baby and put moved over into the H house for a little bit oh well that'll that'll preach but but let's let me let me pause here and let's look at what the some of the naysayers of the message say because they'll use these they'll use a misinterpretation of what brother rand's Doctrine is to poke at what we believe and they so for example they'll say uh this this one article I found I think it was on Wikipedia they say adherance of the white supremacist theology which is known a two as two seedline Christian identity don't believe that the Jew before I get into this let me just give a brief explanation people try to associate that they discredit the serpent Seed doctrine by trying to make it something racist or trying to make it exclusionary which is in some cases a lot of people in the message have done saying by saying that if you come from this specific line in the flesh that you can be saved but if you can't haven't then you can't be saved and and and and so that people will take that and exploded out into well if you if you're if you're a why person and we read this if you're white you can be saved if you come from the right lineage you can be saved but the people that can't be saved that's where the black people and Jews and all this other they put them in that b in that and and and you see they twist up the truth and and I I just want to declare this morning that I don't stand for none of that Tommy Rock that's a bunch of trash and that is not what you go back and listen to the serpent seed message and brother Ram said that a black man can give a white man a blood transfusion and I can actually live off of his same blood because we're made the same we're all made the same and so they twist that and say well well see brother random was promoting a racist idea but there's no racist racism or anything any any inclination of that and any of the things that he taught if you would just go back and listen to it listen to what he really said that what he really said was we're all lumped in this together and we all need a redeemer we all need a lamb's sacrifice and that's why Abel brought a lamb because he knew the only way back was through the blood of something and it had to be an animal cuz an animal was the one that that caused the mess in the beginning the the Beast so let an animal brother R said in the in one of the church Messengers messages it was animal life that caused it so let animal life pay the price until finally Christ had come on the scene and die for us and his blood could have an effect in your life and change you and begin to redeem your soul and begin to work outward change in your spirit until one day your body will be changed that's right see your your flesh got messed up in the beginning but God has got an antidote for that he's got a way to redeem your flesh the same way that he redeemed your soul and your spirit now let me get back to this quote I'm going get carried away he said adherance of the white supremacist theology this this is this quote I got on the internet which is known as two seedline Christian identity do not believe that the Jews or the chosen people of God because in their view only white people are the descendants of Adam and hence the chosen people of God according to their belief members of all other races are descended from Cain and are thus descended from Satan especially Jews and blacks this belief was popularized by Wiley Smith Conrad guard Dan Gaiman and William Potter among others the opposing faction is called one seedline Christian identity because it's adher and so the view that all people are descended from Adam but they believe that only Aryans meaning norn Europeans are God's chosen people now let's see how they tie this in with brother ran according to this guy named Steven Hassan brother brandham sermons lay the foundation to believe that black people are the inferior race brandham used the term hybrid to describe anything he believed to be tainted by the serpent which he did not oh you see how see how it easy it is for somebody to twist things into something that's and it's so important you you you got to have your own Revelation your own experience that's why you got to when you hear somebody say something about a church or a Doctrine or whatever go back yourself and search things out and find out if it really is true what people are saying cuz I if you go back and listen to what brother Brandon preached and the serpent seed and visible Union and all these things you can't come away with this kind of understanding they're just trying to use it to discredit and and I think you know we sometimes we shy away from these things because you know I I I I I think we should uh I think it's helpful to just um people are battling this kind of stuff out all the time I think it's helpful to just just put it right out there in the open and shine a spotlight on the mess that this is brandom Accused Eve of producing a hybrid race certainly she produced a hybrid race and he provided a way to trace the hybrid line of the serpent seed to Africans and Jews nope not like that no through ham the biblical progenitor of the African peoples King Ahab Judas Iscariot Roman Catholic and the future Antichrist how you going to trace the serpent seed not not through your flesh like that but you trace the serpent seed by what you believe today but while just like how Eve disbelieved God's word and took one word off today you can still take one word off and believe the lie of the devil you the believe in the LIE of the devil is what what produces it it produced a mess in the beginning and it's going to produce a mess in the end time and that's why God sent us the antidote and a message that would restore tie up all the lucans and tie up all the misunderstandings and all the confusion and give us Clarity in an age where everybody is confused and the person that wrote this is clearly confused he said Michael Burkin wrote that Brandon was the most significant proponent of the racial teaching racist teach teaching outside of the Christian identity movement and directly influenced their theology which is a lie of the devil it's a straight up lie of the devil just like so many of these things that people say that uh if you go research it's just a lie like that brother Brown said that had rri's daughter was going to be healed that's a lie he never said that he said if God told me that she would be healed she'll come out of that out of that wheelchair or whatever she was in so many things it's it's a lie a lie just like the devil spun to Eve in the beginning that where he just take just one little word that's close and just twist it until it's it just it it can't produce anything real so brother manam said in the spoken word is the Original Seed if we go back to that quote he said every man no matter whether he's the pope priest Bishop whatever he is he dies because he's a hybrid that's right now that puts us all in the same category oh well well bless God I I I'm sure I can trace my lineage back to Adam somehow or or whatever whatever you'd say but no matter whether you a pope priest Bishop whatever you are whatever you are you need a redeemer whatever you are and you need a savior that means whether you're a prophet a priest a king whatever that's exactly he was born between who Satan and Eve and they call it whatever you want to it was Satan and Eve the original word had nothing to do with it the original word was life he had hybrid it and it brought death that's why Genesis chapter 2 God told him if the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it the tree of knowledge of good takes him good and take some evil and God didn't want us to know about evil he just wanted us to know about good to know him see God didn't want us to know about pornography and he didn't want us to know about addiction to cigarettes he didn't want us to know about all the filth that you learn in school he didn't want us to know about all he wanted us to just have faith and confidence in him you eat of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die in the message oness he said his kingdom Satan's kingdom can promise nothing but death that's all he has he's the author of death he can promise lies but he's the father of Lies he can't give you life he can't give you Heaven he has no heaven to give you think of it one word to disbelieve God through a promise of the devil or his Machinery one word sends you into torment one word twisted up and we'll stop there but that's something to think about that God can the devil can take one word take the serpent Seed doctrine and twist it up and make it racist take one word twist twist it up and say well the promise of the Holy Ghost s for you and give you torment one word often say well some people just can't get it no matter how much they want it some people but I want to I want to end on this that the promise is to whosoever will it doesn't matter where you come from in your flesh I have no confidence in the flesh but I have confidence in what Jesus Christ did for me
