========================================

[Music] openiy I want to see a man I want to see do you see you hi [Music] shining in the latter a men pour out your power and Oh [Music] shining in the light on your beret pour out your power and Oh [Music] only [Music] Oh [Music] Oh a man and a man and a man I want to see don't you and good to see everybody the house the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures where we've been reading in Ephesians we'll go from Ephesians two and then we'll go to Hebrews four visions to Hebrews four remember it is pray for the sick ones among us and things thank God for that part of having an internet that we can you know people can view and things without having to come to service when they're sick and things are going wrong thank God for that one of those wonderful opportunities in the last days for us to have on me now remember that remember the fellowship meeting will be at brother pageants on the third Saturday of this month keep that in mind member this coming Sunday is Mother's Day so we appreciate all of the mothers and things and thank God for that remember the two the brothers on the Father's Day weekend now that will be going up for a little time on leaving like we did last time leaving from here Sunday afternoon and be there Monday and Monday night and Tuesday and you know and you just try to house some time together fellowshiping and this time we'll be inside our conditioned buildings instead of being where it was kind of little hot last time so just remember that and we'll pray that the Lord would do it okay any other announcements I know I'm gently wind up missed something but Ephesians 2 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you're saved and has raised us up together and let us sit together and heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might shew thee seeking riches of His grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works lest any man should boast ok let's go over to Hebrews 4 in verse 12 as for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder now not whacking it out like a heart and you got these parts and the cuttin it's the dividing by revelation or singing you know separating and making it where you can understand piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the Jonson Amara and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've been covering that you're saved by grace through faith hoping the tests dwelled within our hearts and and things we'll try to pick up a few more points along the way and if you will by this coming Sunday read again the future home will try to pick up some parts because what we want to do is to just break it down to the most simple points that we can talk about and talk about our own experiences and things that has happened to us you know in our experience in our Christian journey because what are we talking about saved by grace through faith it's been a journey it's the journey of a Christian you start out and you you travel through time I said you can get that book on the prints that when it's on prints come on the missed it my prints for the house of David the man's journey right there you go okay we get all of our heads together and maybe we can come out with it okay tickle runs progress it's hard to read but it really once you break it down and understand what it's saying it gets very interesting if you'll read it from that point of seeing your life and your journey is a Christian and your walk and your doings and I that's what it's made for all right then knowing that we're saved by grace okay but it's through faith so then it's a journey it's it never stops the Christian journey once it begins it will never stop alright we leave this world I've always taught you what I believe I believe we're just getting enough here to be able to understand what's going on there I don't think it's gonna be a dull thing you know and we won't know and we won't understand now this is just getting us read here for that day to understand dire because it'll be a constant journey the Prophet said he would be giving us his message of tear down through the endless ages see after you're already in the future home and I thought it would be wonderful it's not a knot of something that well we're gonna go there and we're gonna play harps and we're gonna run around on clouds and do things no it's gonna be right here I like that that that was a thrill to my heart when I first heard the Prophet explaining it and I tell you that when he did explain that simply learning in the future home I had no problems understanding I'm not saying understood everything he said it I said I had no problem understanding the point I thought he was trying to get at is to show us because it he said if you don't get nothing he said get the plan of salvation well alright then that then you know we'll get into Nicodemus and and the things more into the May as we go along but now you're saved by grace through faith what is faith faith is a revelation all right now the Prophet said Patmos vision he says you can't be saved without a revelation then he said a revelation says what is it what is he said it's faith faith is a revelation to you if something revealed to you that it's not revealed to everybody else now it is if they're being they're getting their revelation you understand what I mean but he can come down right here in the building and contact each and every person sitting here and be individually dealing with each person in a little different manner but yet still be showing and revealing himself all right now I want to get this point in then we'll pick up without in the message now see I know that I've watched in the thoughts and the questions and sometimes the comments it makes us to think about what's going on now the Prophet said Christ mister God revealed what is the new birth run now see you ask people what is the new birth I shouted I cried I done this I done that right I went to the altar I was there I fell under conviction and all those things are good but that's not the answer to the question the question is the Prophet said what is the new birth well I won't brother dad I don't I don't follow that cause I don't understand what you mean by revelation all right now let's deal with that just a little bit it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you all right now the church is built upon a revelation right the gates of Hell can't prevail but will be against it but can't overrun it all right now so what is a revelation it's hard to talk to people and I don't mean this wrong now I mean it just seriously like in me it's hard to talk to children a lot of times about the new birth as the truth of it now if it's just movements and things we do well I shouted I cried I done this any of it all of that that's well and good but those are after-effects that is not the new birth that's the baby crying when the baby gets here right well what is the new birth now what about a man that could make it and talk about Oh spoken words regional scene he said the opening of the word is the new birth remember we gave those quotes you say brother della I've never had a revelation what what do you mean you seem to be putting it up on something since I've watched you over the years you seem to be putting it up on something supernatural Rim of the opening of the word well I'm glad you saw that because that's exactly what I've been trying to do is to get us to see the opening of the word now did we believe the Prophet he said what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then he covers in it he said you are part of on Christ's ministry you are part of the mystery and you are to be revealed now what about see we talked about the revelation of Jesus Christ he turns right back and talks about him being revealed in us well to me you know what that sounds like that sounds like that the Prophet was right when he says you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior that's well and good but he says now has he accepted you he said now that's a different thing well you said well what do you mean has he accepted me I accepted him what else gonna do that's true abraham believed god that was imputed unto it but you know what if he had to believe god it couldn't have been imputed it wasn't imputed because of his works it was imputed because he he had this that this that or the other are the great things how he was imputed unto him because he believed God's Word now as I said it's hard to talk to young children a lot of times about the new birth because of the way that we try to present it but yet how could it be any more simpler then what the Prophet is brought it it's a revelation of Jesus Christ well brother Dale I just I was setting it in the in a few we'll try to review a lot of these later I was sitting harina I just broke down and started crying and I just started weeping and I started doing and you know when I got up and I came to the altar and I was prayed for and this and that does it happen alright now where's the revelation you see I'm gonna drive that hard for a few minutes if nothing else what is the revelation do you remember when you couldn't understand the Trinity you know you thought there's three of them but then through the explaining of the Prophet you came to an understanding of how that is not three gods not three persons if one God revealed in many offices you know are things manifestations does that right now I ask you again is that right because you just told me if you answered that correctly from a heart of understanding you just told me that God revealed itself to you right you just told me of getting a revelation you remember when you was in the churches and things you know before you and then you begin to hear the message and all at once let me express it like this to the sisters it'll be easier to get maybe and you fought the idea of the hair and the clothes and the you know makeups and the things you fought that right you didn't believe that was right because you'd been taught it was okay to do those things right but the one day it came to you lieutenant right I can remember talking to my wife about it and I would I would discuss it with her cuz I work all week long them different night shifts and everything in a lot of times with this Saturdays was our talking time you know you know we get to discussing the hire and the clothes and the things and I mean it get pretty heated I guess you'd call it yeah and I just couldn't get her to see about the hire no just I couldn't well something seemed to tell me said you're approaching it wrong you know if I'm proceeding it wrong I need to change my tactics is that is that the best way to get out of something if you're told you're doing it wrong that means you try to do it some other way and it said just leave it alone water baptism we discussed that at length especially that one run because she didn't you know if I to ask her not to cut her hair no more she got no more problems with that as far doing is she done it you know because I'd asked her but then we get into it about water baptism well that ain't essential you know that's we'd get well something just said leave it alone you say well that wasn't God well bless God he didn't made out of way okay that's what I said while ago he deals with everybody individually so one day I told her we was coming home from church and you heard the store it was a dead of winter and you know ice and everything and brother Holland brother Lewis and there was another brother I can't remember his name but you know I know there was three of them you know I told her coming down the road I said they were gonna have a baptismal services coming son dear every what it was would you know what was gonna be in she is a real quad I said brother Holland brother Lewis is gonna get baptized and I called it other brothers know him and can't remember him cuz he did he went on never did get baptized uh-huh called he's too cold then he is the only smart one in the crowd he's honest cuz it was the water fountains were froze this high sprayed up in Gainesville and we had who I don't like linear oh no I see blowing off for her to have for the baptism well you know I was driving along and said jewel brothers brother Harlem that brother I said they plan on getting baptized this Sunday she said I thought I would too I mean that was in shock now that wouldn't no easy little you know that was a shock well you don't want she went out to Hertz what I'm saying they baptized her we had to go to little old didn't how no heated bathrooms and out nothing and a little Johnny house looking concrete made things for you to change in and she had icing on her when we went in to take her clothes off and everything you know she meant it well you know what all of my argument her all about how wrong she was didn't change a thing so Mel spoke right see to me when you do like that then you know what a revelation is if it's a revelation of Jesus Christ within why would we not want to read I remember that or the Christ in history and what is jumping into that and reading it then I'm seeing the great things that he is bringing to us about that what are you listening the one saying that it's honest what is the new bar it's a revelation it's something that's revealed to you well no no I thought if something happened to me that's what happened to you the bird happened my wife had been fully convinced by that time and she walked right out into the water and I was standing there and I'm not joking I had on a long anything no you ever hardly seen me I had a long wool overcoat and I was freezing to death and as a matter of fact I'd have been tickled to death if they'd have called it off I'm serious but they're serious and they got it done meaning something had changed now do you see I'm talking about a revelation you used to believe old but there's got to be three guards got to be a Father Son and Holy Ghost fighter no good old badnesses fightin I the father then I deny the son so I can't do now this kind of I've got to have all the three it's got to be there but then something happens one day and all at once the Prophet says your father your son and you're a human and you look at that and you gone why didn't I see that before why did not see that it was revealed are you listening something was revealed that it didn't make no difference now I've told you my case some of you may not have been that serious that part about it but hey I was a deacon in a Baptist Church that you probably don't believe it but check with them that's our you can go from nest Baptist or Methodist you don't have to be rebaptised but you go from a Methodists or Baptists are from a Catholic or hoodoos or whatever anything you join the Baptist Church you're gonna get baptized in that church if you don't believe me go find out it's almost to the point of water baptism into regeneration that's very close to it because they will not have you and if you go right now and join the Baptist Church right now you're gonna get baptized again or they will not give you your little card showing you as a member in good standing no so what are you talking about see I put my whole life my whole thing the day I got baptized I looked at brother more that's in themselves that see that day I knew I was going back to that church until them goodbye not hatefully but lovingly to all of them but telling them so long because I was contrary to that faith the something was made known to me enough to show me that I would put my whole life everything behind it there was no more to be a Baptist deacon no more to be anything and if you're ever ordained a Baptist Deacon you are ordained for life I don't care what you do you'll be a member in bad standing but you can I'm still a deacon ordained in the Baptist Church in Galesville Georgia and I've been out of there over 50 years no that's the way they honor it like I said they wouldn't let me be in charge in that they can't argue that point listen Church you said what are you trying to get at brother that one thing has never been revealed to you as one God been revealed to you has never been revealed to you sisters is wrong to cut you higher I mean revealed I don't mean just because somebody said don't do this you know I remember when I was first coming to come into the message and a certain brother was coming certain states well all the women would put on certain types of dresses a certain type of shoes because we did and they're gonna get it when he got there now you know that's true no I didn't ever have no fear he sat down in his house talked with him you know no fear of it because I didn't have no fear of that part maybe because I didn't have higher like women but I still I didn't have no problem I'm asking you a simple question has one God ever been revealed to you I mean reveal to you not just your thoughts and something haven't been revealed to you has it been brought to a basis that nobody can't take that away from you well I had rather held that experience as a new birth then to shout all over the hilltops of the world cuz I got something to put it on I got the evidence of that morning I don't cut my hair don't paint my face I don't do that I don't wear shorts I don't worry that's not those are after-effects the birth is the birth of the word you have a brother Dale we've always been told you know crying dude that's wonderful I know I'm an arrogant and hateful when I say things but you know they cry funerals the cry weddings is that all you have is an experience what is your experience I believe railroad don't do that with me please cuz it ain't gonna convince me and they you ain't doing nothing with it to believe brother Branham was a prophet is an aftereffect it's proof or something that goes with it just like crying is after effect of a baby the Prophet said it's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word come on yes but I agree well I believe everything that prophet said amen now then what are you gonna do when he said to white horse rider would he had it was a Holy Ghost do you agree with that that ain't in the word and he corrected it right you get what I'm talking about just that's what I said don't throw it at me cuz it don't work I believe everything the Prophet taught there's some things better run at all then when he told him they were incorrect oh don't load our brother Dale now you're going too far I wouldn't be saying if I couldn't back it up with what he said he said I used to think Jesus loved me and God hated me you remember that one he said until I found out it was the self same person right you said what brother Dale you're you're trying to destroy if what I say about that is the truth and I can quote what your prophets say it it's you it's got the problem not me but I'm asking you a simple question when we come in this message we had very little understanding of the Bible but it's not true you know most of that was twisted and warped up but look at it today and see where God has brought you in the 10 years 20 years 30 or 40 or 50 years or five years than where you started yet you see that you've been in a journey that has constantly been the word unfolding well I've always just talked a new birth was something I've done words get it where'd you get that teaching from it certainly was not from the Bible and it certainly was not from the Prophet see we swiped by those things when it's not even in the Bible at all that's what I'm talking about now told you my experience for two years after coming in this message I never claimed because I just come into this message or whatever it was doing baptism and all of that that I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost I would never accept that even though I was told over and over you have all of it you've done this you know what do you mean you're saved you got all you've done this you've done that that's why I said well I must have been saved the whole time because no and brother Moke done everything in the world to try to help me to understand and he said I don't understand you brother I said I don't either he said I know you're not looking for some great something to happen because he knew I could tell things that had happened I could about seeing the angel of the Lord I could tell about seeing those type of things I said brother I don't know either I just know there's one thing I don't have a satisfaction he said all right now I'll just tell you one thing did you go out to solve it one way or the other did you believe the word don't see I said yes sir you know that and you know the way I studied it and praying reading four or five books a day and everything else he said just put it on word and say God reveal this to me we were done in Athens Georgia there Neil called hollyhocks building their brother was preaching we were sitting on the front row hadn't been old drunk sitting outside of us only how that ever got out guard with the in in nanny both were we went to the altar to be prayed for and we got down to be prayed for and you know everybody coming up laying hand on and something happened that she felt one way I fell the other way you said well did you get up having all this great understanding no did God speak to you ought to blend tell you safe know what happened I got up from there and I said thank you Lord it's all solved as far as I'm concerned from this day forward I'll go with you there won't be any more of this wondering what this is what that is it's all settled and that day to this day it's been a constant progressive opening of God's Word now I'll take that as my experience yes but you never shouted you never cried no smoke no and I'm not saying you're wrong because you did I'm saying that between you and God but around said whatever point you're born again under will determine that part you know the spirituality if you're born again under an emotional great moving group you'll be most emotional most of the time if you're born again under some dry light form you'll be more of that form because it would be according to your nature see I never had no great wisdom come down no but I knew it was solved that was the end of it and from that day to this whatever started talking to him and then has never stopped I've told you I've seen God when I was 11 years old most of you heard that told over and over so many times you don't have it memorized some of you been here 50 years you know I've been saying that well I never said I was born again cause that's all that the mom new birth has never stopped since that day I've never had any trouble from that day on as I would study the word and wait upon God he would come and speak to me I never had any trouble I just wait on him brother you're not an emotional person like I am alright that's I just explained that different people are different emotional situations and times but what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ I thought that this message was the revelation of Jesus Christ is that to what you think that's what I've always told that this message is a revelation of Jesus Christ cuz that's where I've been getting all I've been teaching all the years it's from this message well rather than I just I just still I ivory and that would be good if it was just some form of some emotional situation let me ask you what your prophet put his own he was in the woodshed prayin he said well he saw this great angel come down he never told it like that he never told that as his new birth if he did you come show me that'll end me is no problem because he never put it that away he always put it on the opening of the word remember in the woods he had he was took off a rundown now there's two or three ways for the running explains his Newburgh all right so you'd have to take each one of them something looks like it don't compare to the other come on read it you need any help IEP the one time he took off running down the railroad track mountain glory hallelujah what was his experience was Jesus Christ revealing himself to him what did he put the whole message on Jesus Christ being revealed on you you understand what I'm saying that's what I'm trying to preach talking about it saved by grace through faith through a journey that God has revealed himself to you it's not the great things that we think it is it's to believe God what was Abraham's great experience that was wrote of in the word then he believed God and it was imputed unto it are imparted are reckoned unto him for righteousness David cried out in his soul but what did the prophets say all he needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was the one thing David didn't have those people back gar never had a baptismal it was not for them but they had a great experience they saw visions their dreams they saw great things the dead raised to sit healed all kind of things but it could not put him in the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is the baptism when the old ago and it hadn't come it didn't come until the upper road but listens hers do you believe your prophet he said what is the new birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's not you shouted you cried you spoke in tongues you get all kind of like all that is well and good all of those things is enjoyable but those things come after the birth the baby cries after that gets here as God revealed itself to you ask you simple question why are you trying to follow this message if he's not revealed it to you or do you understand what I mean why would you want to try to follow the message if it's not been revealed to you I'm dumb but if the message has not been revealed is it been revealed to you than just one God it's been revealed to you that hell's not eternal and it been revealed to you that Malachi 4 is fulfilled in our day and how many more things do we need for to say that those things is made known well I'd rather have that is my new birth than anything I could think of over brother Dale if I just saw visions like brother Branham did yeah you can only be saved by a revelation no no now brother Dale oh yeah where is he and what happened is they didn't okay I wouldn't intending to go we don't go this way pick another part later the disciples spent three and a half years in the ministry of Jesus Christ seeing the dead raised the sick healed all kind of signs and wonders all copper manifestations feeding the people doing all multiplying the food every kind of a thing it didn't say for one of them come on had to go to Pentecost now if you think the new birth didn't take place on the day of Pentecost may I remind you wouldn't it Peter that says this is that which was spoken of by the prophets the great Upper Room experience and come on Church listen don't don't try to pull aside just listen I believe ever born-again believer this truly gets born again that takes a lick of fire over your head when that takes place because 120 in the upper room all had a lick of fire right well then why wouldn't you believe you have a lick of fire cuz come on your prophet said ever how you saved one he's got to save all the new birth to ever person is the same so then how could you put it as being some kind of done this I done that at but the opening of the word comes to ever individual in their Christian journey and dies their new birth remember the disciples walked three and a half years with the Lord Jesus saw him I through his resurrection ascension all the things he come down to that part what did they say are you gonna restore the kingdom to Israel but this time they still didn't know what in the world he was talking about or what he was doing right come on they said are you gonna restore they were still looking for a natural kingdom but when they walked up in that Upper Room a few days after that ascension and all at once here come the power of Almighty God down don't you ever don't you ever think the brother dare would believe in just a cold formal non-emotional new birth don't you think that because they owe you that devil to take you away with that because it sounds like that's the way I teach but it's not I don't tell all that God does with me because I don't want you building on it what little bit he's told me has built too much on it I want you born again I want you with your own experience I want you to be able to face God with your own experience but mainly I won't you be able to face the devil your own experience something that you got is real not just an imagination well look what darker we talk another day about it the Bible said that that Jesus was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection and he called him brethren and only 120 made the upper room where was the 380 I didn't say they didn't come on get safe they were called brother they didn't make it to the upper room yeah I'm a firm believer in a anointing of the Holy Ghost I believe ever born-again believer receives an anointing over the Holy Ghost well I'd go along with you brother but just don't I can't follow you when you talk about the new birth is being a revelation in the book of Acts they had many feelings mature you Bible people then were true many feelings in the book of Acts one new birth the many feelings many times when the Holy Ghost would come down in a group of people and great things they'd already had the new birth what is your new birth I wish you would write down your experience if you don't want me to let anybody else ever read it and never nobody else see that with me I'd like to hear your experience of what you put your whole form of salvation based upon I've told you mine I go through it every day I believe in that being born again I know you don't like these statements but you consider them you know yourself and most ministers in this message I'll never touch the seals they'll never touch Daniel 70 weeks they run like crazy for marriage and divorce they won't talk about these things but to me they're part of my life they're part of my life that's one there's no fear to preach when you know where you standing I don't know ever saying nothing didn't say that I'll take one thing about it well let it go I've tried my best to get you to see for almost 50 years that I've been preaching here of what the new birth is believing it in 1969 to preach that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man revealed in the last days but a random as a son of man the bride is decent man see that's where you divide it and then we won't listen you think you're throwing off on something no I'm trying my best to get you to see something you realize that the moment you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior you received a revelation from Almighty God to not make you the happiest person in the world to think that God would reveal itself to you yeah but I just didn't know it that's what I mean come on you were sitting in a Pew like I was listening the reverse nice night over again it's not much a new birth you remember when I've talked about it Sunday and I always told you something I believe that your new birth will starts when you believe but you don't want if you get up back right there in the back and you call this away your new birth don't begin down here it begun back tire the day or the minute you got up started this way now I'm quoting brother Branham your new birth begin when something spoke to your heart you can't deny what I play what about the man that found a book or will you spend eternity he goes to all brother runs telling it come on he goes to build all Roberts's the Billy Graham's he goes everywhere and none of them give him a satisfactory answer he said I give away all my money they said well you need to go to William Branham let him he said you remember when you picked that track up now come home the Prophet said when you picked that track up it said you started right there the man said you mean I've had it all the time he said he was well I mean he just picked up a track and ready he said you made a decision see when you left my curtain you know you give an altar call and you get up and walk down it's not the importance here if you're you praying for healing you you get up by car start this away I can tell you upon the basis of God's almighty word and not back off a split second Aaron sit down you got it because you stood up was coming this way you don't have to come down that's God's Word but do we believe it that way no you want me to Aaron what happened was he was thinking today at work now yours up on the building you almost fail and something happening to you you decided not to go that way you went over this way well God was God was that's well and good if it's true well and good give me the anchor of God's Word I want something that Satan can't impersonate you know what I'm saying I'm not against nobody with gifts I believe in them firm believer in gifts more than anybody in this building believes in gifts and I don't back off of nothing on that I've seen gifts I know what they are let's see most people don't know what a gift is for nothing we talked about saved by grace you realize the gifts are grace you realize God gave you a gift and that's His grace but you know what that don't save you come on come on or knit ones come on I know ain't gonna get very far so I pray that what I've said on that part you will think about a revelation that you're saved by revelation when you got up something spoke to you why can't you believe that was God that spoke to you well the devil can do it to you don't worry about him okay getting him to show before the troubles that you listen to what your prophet said that man had eternal life from the very point of him just believe what about it maybe you don't understand the point I'm trying to get at I'd rather have one word from God then all that everybody else could ever Paulo him if you ever get a revelation truly get one you'll know the gates of Hell can't prevail and I'm not talking about a head knowledge and a hope so earnest like that or something you know somebody calling you out I believe in every bit of that I believe in all the gifts was somebody calling you out and telling you this and telling you that that's well and good the brother branham was the one that said it he said the gift don't say you gifts don't save people but when you realize that giver is there then you realize that giver himself is right there now you got something to stand on well I I thought the new birth was some kind of this some kind of an emotional situation that's were the wrong with the people's that never was get to birth emotions faultless is that simple enough get to birth emotions follow it but maybe you never had a revelation to where God would speak to you and then you realize hey that's discussion with a Greek scholar and we had said a few things backwards and forth and in here and he was literally a Greek scholar you know he said you know I can take the Bible and tear you to pieces he said what would you say I said I guess you're right but he wasn't gonna do it what he just said and so I told him I said you've made the challenge I didn't because matter of fact he didn't challenge me challenge brother mote remote didn't hear him I heard him and brought it to the attention to the whole group and everybody knew what he was saying then and I said brother you got all you won't imagine divorce how many services do you want unless you want to three services you want us to travel I said I will travel some way I'll be able to get off or we'll have a representative to represent us we'll give you how many times services you want you want three services we'll give you three services three times you know three three different times I see you have all you want I said well I won't sir is one time to talk about the Word of God I said we're not gonna take ideas and quotes we're gonna take the Bible well he never said no more I'm not trying to brag on that I'm bragging on one time you see if I can see that if I can see it in the word enough to know that Greek scholar couldn't tackle that word because it already he'd already failed and blowed it clean out of the picture I was gonna let him blow all he wanted to then I was gonna remind him of that when I did remind him he's the church if you know what you're talking about you don't have to worry about it but if you don't know in the Bible then you're at the mercies of whatever see to me the new birth is the new birth that's why I said to you don't get back to this point Jesus said to Nicodemus if you don't understand earthly things apart phrased it but it's closer he says if you don't understand earthly things he said how can I talk to you about spiritual things he said I say unto you you must be born again in other words he was telling Nicodemus you were born wrong come on Nicodemus said I don't understand it I got all of my lines and then the lineages his right everything is correct he said you must be born again and you got to be born to water in spirit he told him exactly what it takes to bring a new birth right he turned around and left do we know what the new birth really is we're gonna get back to this and we'll cover it he brought a random cover that's why I love it that's in the message he said when God he's first off God has to call you that's the number one thing you can't come to God until he calls you now that's Scripture we'll get to that so when he calls you you accept his call and you walk forth with him the rest of the journey will be made possible if you keep walking if not you'll walk away was not that what he was telling Nicodemus I'm asking you a simple question as a thought I've made my statement I've always made it I believe ever born-again believer has the same experience there is only one experience of the new birth no I don't agree with that we'll come and show me then show me any more experience there's only one experience in that Upper Room there was 120 of them that was the only experience the 3000 that came in later down Stars had the same experience or else God done something wrong I'm quoting your prophet ever body has the same experience because everybody has the same noubar I didn't have no experience like brother so enjoy having spirit there's no problem did you have one yourself come on musician don't have to enter them have you ever had one yourself something you know is real and you take your experience back would we be qualified to not upon what we believe when it took three and a half years further disciples to qualify for an upper room experience am i right it took three and a half years for them to qualify now could we qualify for an upper room experience tonight if we do we go out to come same way they did and what I just don't understand you because you you you just like it some kind of a something it is the opening of God's Word is the new birth and the Prophet said the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now if you had a personal revelation of Christ what about it this damn well we go have that all the way anybody have a need the new bar is the birth of the world [Music] the promise saying they took you will get to these things they took that word and held it and the Holy Ghost came to that word that they had hailed [Music] that I will learn you learn man they're in your new burn [Music] for you to take the word and believe it that's God equipping it Oh search me Andrew [Music] [Applause] [Music] bastard water and snow watch me as [Music] Oh [Music] No [Music] as gon revealed itself to you help me you're having to speak to you about something that was impossible [Music] and you get hold on see it coming forward I never beat nobody to try to run them away from church they never be nobody to try to run them to it it's a choice [Music] [Applause] they some of you in this building today the 20-30 years ago God told me you'd be here [Music] see why didn't you tell me I can't tell you [Music] my toe wait that's the Lord already told me she was gonna be ministering he said what didn't you tell me that'd be daddy calling and Mama send and that won't work now you runs on run until you run your daylights out of you because the prophet of God said God can't use somebody that volunteers so don't volunteer run till he runs you down brother the hell he come walking back in one day and he says over I said ok it's over we got it solved that's sound like he's trying to run him away if I could run him away he wouldn't have been God you see that's why I say you tell things and people want to get built on emotional situations or something did you tell I'll tell that for the glory of God [Music] cuz I believe that's how really is [Music] I'm believing so real until he's right here with us and doing and seeing you remember back a few years ago when a brother saw the pillar of fire to platform saw it Truth three different times at the platform him saying nothing one day he come in and he said brother Dale I saw that pillar of fire again I said he said you mind if I tell the church I said no I'll allow you to tell it now he said visits differ from what true what I said you tell it like it is he said you was up here and said that pillar of fire turned and went back dark a couple of brothers and the message got the great revelation that the pillar of fire was leaving the building [Music] I just come out here told you I said it'd be a good idea if that's the way you believe for you to go out to Dover in other words that said what you gonna do I thought mom stay right here said yell but the filler fire was going out the door I said to brother he's welcome to get a print of it he never saw the pillar fire go out that door he said no I didn't I said you saw him leave here and go back dark you didn't see him go out the door I said cause he never went out the door I said reason I'm staying here I know where he went he went from what I'm trying to preach for me to you [Music] he went right back into congregation and that's all I've ever wanted is to see Christ living in the people the greatest honor the greatest talks could ever be is to see Christ living in his people he said I don't want no problem I can just talk and talk the rest of the night about that well brother Tate him had a dream one night come and told me he said saw two snakes I said don't worry about it I got him by the tail he said well you think you know yeah I think I know I said we're gonna let them manifest herself then it won't be no problem your brother Tatum was here he could witness to it you know he wouldn't lie about it I said we're brother Tatum here's the way I stand I said I might be one of those snakes that's going out the door you better know the difference that's all I say to you you got to know whether or not you've got an experience I can't tell you about you about your experience you can but it's so simple you mean it just this me believing that's where it starts but if you stop believing your salvation stops that's why I say what do you want to build on any kind of signs and wonders listen to the word see what the word says Lord Jesus you know he was going another way and we changed their ways of going in that's up to you and you just have your way you help us to understand the one thing Lord we believe in a firm understanding of a new birth you told Nicodemus said you must be born again you didn't have to explain to him what you was talking about when you said you got to be born of water and in spirit he knew immediately what you were saying but he just couldn't put it into his own life so he walked away yet he was close enough until you get eternal life as a witness for standing for the truth what a wonderful God we serve we thank you as we go home you take care of everybody give a safe journey it's your love and your grace be with each one of us remember the sick among us Lord we plead the blood of Jesus Christ and believe in you thanking you have your way and got us in Jesus name you dismissed remember the services [Music]
