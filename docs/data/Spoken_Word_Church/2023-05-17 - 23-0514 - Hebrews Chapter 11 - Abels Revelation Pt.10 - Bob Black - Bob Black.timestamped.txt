[0:00] amen God bless you Saints
[0:05] couldn't be in the house of the Lord and
[0:08] we're talking about faith this morning
[0:12] and just to kind of get things started
[0:14] as we meditate on these scriptures
[0:17] let's read Luke chapter 18 7-9 that says
[0:21] and shall not get God avenge his own
[0:23] elect which cry day and night unto him
[0:25] Jesus telling the parable of the unjust
[0:28] steward
[0:29] though he bear along with him I tell you
[0:31] that he will avenge them speedily
[0:33] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[0:34] shall he find faith on the Earth
[0:37] and he spoke this Parable into certain
[0:39] which trusted in themselves that they
[0:40] were righteous and despised others now
[0:42] you think about this the day that we're
[0:44] living in now that God is looking for
[0:46] somebody that will believe him and it's
[0:47] a place where that he would make this
[0:50] declaration that when the son of man
[0:52] cometh
[0:53] is he going to be able to find faith
[0:55] and you know many times we'll we'll get
[0:58] to a place where we'll think we're doing
[0:59] all right but I I I I want to encourage
[1:02] you
[1:03] to you know just step out in faith
[1:05] because there's many times where we fail
[1:07] to just really take what God Said and
[1:11] grab a hold to it because if you if you
[1:13] grab a hold of what God said something
[1:16] is going to happen now we can kind of
[1:18] see that play out in in the story of
[1:20] Abel here as we as we read through that
[1:23] when Abel came with faith
[1:25] with with a real revelation
[1:28] and God come behind his faith and
[1:31] Vindicated it and proved that he really
[1:33] believed
[1:35] now brother Brown would say and healing
[1:38] what cancer is
[1:39] he said we hear Jesus say when he
[1:41] returns would he find Faith he didn't
[1:43] question whether that he'd find churches
[1:45] or righteousness or teachers but he said
[1:48] would I find faith
[1:50] oh God such a valuable thing
[1:53] in preparation he said will I find
[1:55] somebody who will stand at my word and
[1:58] say every word's right
[2:01] now I'm not scared whether this one says
[2:03] so or that says so or nothing I believe
[2:06] in God and I'm accepting it and standing
[2:09] right there on it
[2:10] that's the thing
[2:12] and that was the thing in Abel's day and
[2:14] that's the thing in our day
[2:17] sometimes you know you got that story of
[2:20] Sarah sitting there in the tent saying
[2:22] that is it going is it be is it going to
[2:24] be possible for my body to be changed
[2:26] for me to have pleasure with my Lord and
[2:27] doubting and things so that you see in
[2:30] this day we can't have no doubts like
[2:31] that we gotta just grab a hold of
[2:34] everything that God said and not doubt
[2:37] not falter but believe that when God
[2:39] said it that your toothache can be
[2:41] healed that everything that if God
[2:43] promised it I believe it and that
[2:46] settles it and all the days of our life
[2:48] he said he didn't say well I find
[2:50] churches will I find religion but will I
[2:52] find faith
[2:53] and not even he didn't question
[2:54] sincerity but he questioned faith
[2:58] and just kind of thinking about faith
[3:00] and Deuteronomy 29 29 it says the secret
[3:03] things belong unto the Lord our God
[3:06] but those things
[3:08] which are revealed belonging to us and
[3:12] to our children forever
[3:13] that we may do all the words of this law
[3:16] now that means
[3:18] once God reveals it to you it's mine
[3:22] if God reveals it to you it's my
[3:24] possession so these things that are
[3:26] laying here in the scriptures as we read
[3:28] about when God opens it up to us and
[3:30] gives us the revelation of the thing
[3:33] you got a promise that you can have it
[3:36] let's pray before we go into the study
[3:38] Lord we just think so thankful to be
[3:40] able to gather here today Lord and to be
[3:42] looking able to look into the secret
[3:43] things and now have been made known to
[3:45] us we just ask your blessing upon the
[3:47] study this morning that you will prepare
[3:49] our hearts for the services today or the
[3:52] service today as we just have one
[3:54] service and I pray God that your lord
[3:56] just feel that Liberty Lord to help us
[3:58] we ask in your name
[4:00] so verse 4 that we've been kind of
[4:02] studying on and I I think we'll I think
[4:04] we'll make some Headway past this it's
[4:06] kind of taken a while to get through
[4:08] this story but I think it's been helpful
[4:10] to kind of background and you know some
[4:11] some are not familiar with even maybe
[4:13] the story of what's of the the doctrine
[4:15] of what serpent seed is and it's kind of
[4:18] helpful to give some clarity on on kind
[4:20] of back back up a little bit on some of
[4:22] these things but in verse 4 it says if I
[4:24] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[4:27] excellent sacrifice than came
[4:30] by which he obtained witness that he was
[4:33] righteous
[4:35] so so now now that faith faith is how
[4:38] you get righteousness because God's
[4:40] righteousness is applied to you in this
[4:42] case that that that the life of that
[4:44] lamb was applied to Abel God testifying
[4:48] of his gifts God come behind it to prove
[4:50] that the faith that Abel came with
[4:52] offering up that little lamb was the
[4:54] correct approach and he come behind it
[4:56] what with something Supernatural
[4:58] happened oh we gotta we got to be
[5:00] constantly looking for something
[5:01] Supernatural I don't ever cabbage down
[5:04] and say well now we just got a lot of
[5:06] knowledge and stop looking for God to do
[5:08] something I'm constantly looking for
[5:10] some God to move in my life
[5:12] and by it being dead yes speaketh now
[5:16] Brethren would say in God's provided a
[5:18] way of dealing with sin he said here he
[5:20] come pulling the little lamb the lamb
[5:22] knowing that death laid near him pulling
[5:24] back I wonder what kind of a death that
[5:26] was when this little fella knowed he was
[5:28] coming and he laid him upon the rock
[5:31] pulled back his head he perhaps didn't
[5:33] have any knives or lances then so they
[5:35] just took a sharp Rock and began to chop
[5:37] on his Little Neck did you ever hear a
[5:40] lamb die you hear the most pathetic cry
[5:42] you ever heard when you hear a lamb die
[5:44] anyways they beat him across his little
[5:47] jugular veins with this rock and the
[5:49] Bloods spurting out bathing his little
[5:51] wool God looked down and said that's it
[5:55] now wouldn't you this morning sitting
[5:58] here would like for God to have that
[6:00] same testimony about your faith to look
[6:02] at the way that you're believing and say
[6:04] that's it that's what I'm looking for
[6:06] now we read that scripture in Luke that
[6:08] God in this day when the son of man is
[6:10] supposed to be manifest today he's
[6:11] looking for somebody that'll have faith
[6:14] and it's gotten to a place so much where
[6:16] you can't hardly Find Faith but yet
[6:18] there's going to be somebody that'll
[6:20] still believe that'll look at God's word
[6:22] and a promise that's laying there in the
[6:24] scripture and then lay claim to it and
[6:25] say I don't care if people make fun of
[6:27] me for the way that I'm acting I don't
[6:29] care if people
[6:31] say all manner of things I don't care
[6:33] what false preachers say when God said
[6:35] it I'm I'm grabbing a hold to him if
[6:37] there's a promise for my healing or a
[6:39] promise for a new birth or a promise for
[6:41] a super anointing in this day a promise
[6:43] that you understand the Capstone
[6:45] Mysteries I'm grabbing a hold to it and
[6:48] and for God to look at that and look at
[6:50] somebody's Faith like that and say
[6:52] that's it
[6:54] now you read you'll find out further on
[6:56] as we study it through Hebrews 11 that
[6:58] you can't please God without faith that
[7:01] faith is the thing that pleases God so
[7:04] this morning sitting here if you want to
[7:05] be pleasing to God then you've got to
[7:07] believe and that's that's how you make
[7:09] God happy
[7:11] now brother Adam said if we keep reading
[7:14] this quote he said what did he speak of
[7:15] it spoke of some 4 000 years later when
[7:19] the Lamb of God was hanging on the Rock
[7:21] of Ages and the judgments of God of The
[7:24] Sinner Man was hanging there and his
[7:25] bloody locks dripping around his
[7:27] shoulder speaking Abel couldn't
[7:29] understand what the lamb was saying and
[7:31] Jesus when he died spoke in an unknown
[7:33] tongue my God my God why I said Thou
[7:36] forsaken me he was God's lamb dying on
[7:39] the altar the innocent for the guilty
[7:41] God dealing with sin in that manner
[7:44] nothing at all you can do it's all
[7:47] oh you think about how faith faith even
[7:50] is a gift to you that God will give you
[7:53] that gift of his faith simply because
[7:56] you accepted it there was ain't nothing
[7:59] you can do nothing you can work up
[8:00] nothing you can do within yourself all
[8:02] you have to do is accept it and God will
[8:04] give you that gift God has already did
[8:07] it you have to accept it and by
[8:09] Sovereign Grace believing it and God
[8:11] will vindicate your faith by giving you
[8:14] the baptism the Holy Ghost
[8:16] now now there's a pattern I think
[8:18] sometimes when we study out scriptures
[8:19] we need to look for the patterns in the
[8:21] scripture and there's a pattern here
[8:22] that where if you believe then God will
[8:25] vindicate your faith if you believe for
[8:27] the new birth and you truly believe God
[8:29] will come behind that Faith to give you
[8:31] the many birth now that's the same thing
[8:33] for anything that you're believing for
[8:35] if it's real genuine faith God is going
[8:37] to come behind it to prove it God will
[8:40] come behind the meeting this morning the
[8:42] service this morning if you really
[8:43] believe God will come with a
[8:45] supernatural anointing God will move on
[8:47] the scene with your if you really
[8:49] believe God will vindicate it now now
[8:52] all these promises in the scripture that
[8:54] prove that out that God will recognize
[8:56] Faith just like Abel he recognized
[8:58] Abel's faith in Matthew 17 it says truly
[9:02] I tell you if you've got faith as small
[9:04] as a mustard seed
[9:05] you can say to this mountain move from
[9:07] here to there and it will move nothing
[9:10] will be impossible for you now that's
[9:12] what we're trying to uh the god the
[9:14] preaching of the Gospel in this day is
[9:16] trying to raise our faith to up to the
[9:18] point where we don't believe that we're
[9:20] not like Sarah sitting in the tent
[9:22] saying well I I don't know if God can
[9:24] change my body but to believe that all
[9:27] things are possible now it seems
[9:29] sometimes that that's beyond our ability
[9:31] to accept that anything anything is
[9:35] possible if you can believe it if you
[9:37] can grab a hold to it with faith all
[9:39] things are possible now you think about
[9:42] what Jesus was saying here in Mark 11
[9:43] where he said therefore I tell you
[9:46] whatever you ask for in prayer whatever
[9:48] you ask for in prayer now that's a big
[9:52] statement whatever you ask for in prayer
[9:54] believe that you have received it and it
[9:57] will be yours so if you come with faith
[10:01] and prayer and lay God's promises before
[10:04] him with your requests
[10:07] believing something's going to happen
[10:10] now there's when faith gets to moving
[10:11] and Hebrews 11 verse 6 he said without
[10:14] faith we're getting to that in our study
[10:16] of Hebrews 11 without faith it is
[10:18] impossible to please God because anyone
[10:20] who comes to him must believe that he
[10:22] exists and what that he rewards those
[10:26] who earnestly seek him so in other words
[10:27] if you bring your faith expect to get
[10:30] something back don't just bring your
[10:32] faith and say well it's good enough that
[10:34] I know a lot of things but expect to see
[10:37] God move on the scene
[10:39] in James chapter 1 6 7 but when you ask
[10:43] you must believe and not doubt because
[10:45] the one who doubts is like a wave of the
[10:47] sea blown and tossed by the wind
[10:50] that person should not expect to receive
[10:52] anything from the Lord but now if you
[10:55] come with faith you expect to receive
[10:57] you come with your faith believing that
[11:00] you're going to get what you asked for
[11:02] and first John 5 14-15 this is the
[11:06] confidence we have in approaching God
[11:08] that if we ask anything according to his
[11:10] will he hears Us Now isn't that a
[11:12] confidence that when you come in prayer
[11:14] if you need something we don't have a
[11:16] god like like the Buddhas or the James
[11:17] or whatever all these other religions of
[11:19] the world believe that it's just an
[11:21] impartial God that's not involved with
[11:23] you with your activities but we have a
[11:25] God that hears what you have need of and
[11:27] is concerned about you and if we know
[11:30] that he hears us whatever we ask we know
[11:33] that we have what we ask of him
[11:38] now there's faith faith believes that it
[11:43] doesn't matter what it is how big the
[11:45] mountain is what faith brother Brown
[11:47] said it's like big and Burly and it says
[11:50] it tells the devil get off of my
[11:52] property this is mine and I'm coming for
[11:54] it and uh
[11:57] maybe maybe this speaks bullish like
[11:59] sister milk out there the baptismal pool
[12:01] last Sunday saying I ain't taking the
[12:04] devil uh messing with my brother anymore
[12:06] I'm standing on God's promises I'm
[12:09] laying claimed what God promised now
[12:11] there's when you see Faith stepping out
[12:13] something begins to move
[12:16] in Matthew chapter 23
[12:18] uh Jesus said woe unto you scribes and
[12:21] Pharisees Hypocrites for ye pay tithe
[12:24] the mint and Ennis and cumin and have
[12:26] omitted the radio matters of the law
[12:28] what's what is the weightier matters of
[12:30] the law that they were not teaching the
[12:32] spare season scribes he said judgment
[12:35] mercy and Faith to think that it would
[12:37] be Faith would be removed from the
[12:39] teaching of the day that Faith because
[12:42] what is faith faith is when you're
[12:44] believing to expect that God will give
[12:46] you something that God will give you the
[12:49] holy ghost that God will reward your
[12:51] faith that God will give you peace in
[12:53] your family that God will give you your
[12:55] children that whatever you have need of
[12:57] that God will reward your faith with
[13:00] something Supernatural happening these
[13:03] are you they have done and not to leave
[13:04] the other undone and Matthew chapter 19
[13:07] see this is what they were leaving out
[13:09] in that day with their teaching they
[13:11] were forgetting that With God all things
[13:14] are possible all things means all thing
[13:17] anything is possible now this is what as
[13:21] we're setting the stage of able bringing
[13:23] in his little sacrifice brother Ryan
[13:24] said in message presuming he said what
[13:26] was the difference said Moab up on the
[13:29] mountain with seven altars and seven
[13:30] Rams and Israel down in the valley with
[13:32] seven altars and seven Rams both of them
[13:34] keeping the Commandments of God both of
[13:37] them trying to do it but God Vindicated
[13:39] Israel in other words there's some one
[13:41] one of the two sides really believed
[13:44] because God's Gonna vindicate your faith
[13:47] one really had a correct understanding a
[13:50] real Revelation that God was in their
[13:53] midst that God was with him how did Cain
[13:55] when he made an altar just as pretty or
[13:58] prettier than Abel's he offered fruits
[14:00] he give his tithes he brought his income
[14:02] into the house of the Lord he knelt on
[14:04] the altar he bowed himself he prayed he
[14:07] worshiped just as sincere as any man
[14:10] but God Vindicated Abel by consuming his
[14:15] sacrifice in other words God got to give
[14:17] indicated Abel by supernaturally
[14:20] confirming his life and we'll see in a
[14:21] minute where brother Brown proves out
[14:22] that when God supernaturally vindicates
[14:25] somebody's life and it makes the other
[14:27] side jealous jealousy stirs up why are
[14:30] they jealous because there's a
[14:31] supernatural Vindication in the life of
[14:34] a real believer and they don't like that
[14:36] they want they they they get all bent
[14:39] out of shape because they seek God's
[14:40] supernaturally confirming somebody and
[14:42] the life lived out and signs and wonders
[14:46] following them that believe and they and
[14:47] and it makes them jealous now look what
[14:50] brother Ram said I I know this is a
[14:51] little bit small so I'm just going to
[14:53] read it to you in Leviticus 9 24 that I
[14:56] I I wonder what we're what we're trying
[14:58] to do too is we study these things out
[15:00] is to learn how to study the Bible
[15:02] how did Brother Branham know that God
[15:05] consumed Abel's sacrifice because look
[15:07] when you study the word out you because
[15:10] he's the same yesterday today and
[15:12] forever if God does something once one
[15:15] way over here and you can follow that
[15:16] pattern through the scripture you you
[15:18] how did how was the door opened up in
[15:21] Revelation 4. if you can find out how a
[15:24] door is opened up a door on Pentecost
[15:26] how was that door opened up how did
[15:27] Peter open up the door to the Samaritans
[15:29] how how did God open up a door once he's
[15:33] going to open it up the same way the
[15:34] next time if you could find out how he
[15:36] Vindicated Abel's sacrifice then you can
[15:38] find out how your sacrifices how the how
[15:42] the sacrifice was Vindicated on the day
[15:44] of Pentecost when he when he fell on
[15:46] them with the Holy Ghost and Fire so
[15:48] we'll just kind of read through some of
[15:50] these scriptures where in Leviticus 9 24
[15:52] it says fire came out from the presence
[15:55] of the Lord and consumed the burnt
[15:56] offering and the fat portions on the
[15:58] Altar and when all the people saw it
[16:00] they shouted for joy and fell face down
[16:02] Moses has come and and did everything
[16:04] that God required by a revelation of
[16:07] what God required and what did God do he
[16:09] come down with fire and consume the
[16:11] sacrifice on the altar something
[16:13] Supernatural happened
[16:15] and judges 629 when when Gideon was uh
[16:19] you know when fear wondering if God was
[16:21] really with him and he and the angel uh
[16:24] the latest tip of the staff on the Rock
[16:27] on the meat and the unleavened bread and
[16:28] fire consumed the sacrifice that had
[16:32] been offered in First Kings chapter 18
[16:33] the fire of the Lord burned up the
[16:36] sacrifice the wood the stones and the
[16:38] soil this is when Elijah come and
[16:40] rebuilt The Altar and repair the the
[16:42] altars and Fire come and consume the
[16:45] sacrifice accepting what accepting the
[16:48] revelation
[16:50] the Revelation that they that they had
[16:52] come with and First Chronicles 21 David
[16:55] built an altar to the Lord there and
[16:57] sacrificed burn offerings and fellowship
[16:59] offerings he called on the Lord and the
[17:01] Lord answered him with fire from heaven
[17:03] on the altar of burnt offering and
[17:05] second Chronicles chapter 7 when Solomon
[17:08] finished praying after he had built the
[17:09] built the temple and got everything
[17:11] prepared and laid everything out on the
[17:14] altar that God come with a holy fire and
[17:16] consume the sacrifice on the Altar and
[17:19] Hebrews 12 says for our God is a
[17:22] consuming fire
[17:24] in Matthew chapter 3 John the Baptist
[17:26] said I indeed baptize you with water
[17:28] under repentance but he that cometh
[17:30] after me is mightier than I whose shoes
[17:32] I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize
[17:35] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire
[17:36] why does it saying with fire because
[17:38] it's identifying what what the Holy
[17:42] Ghost will do in you with all of these
[17:44] scriptural things that we can read about
[17:47] that the Holy Ghost is the fire of God
[17:49] coming what to vindicate to vindicate
[17:52] your faith
[17:55] that's what it means where it says God
[17:57] testifying of his gifts in verse 4 of
[17:59] Hebrews 11 verse 4.
[18:01] brother Raymond said gifts must be
[18:03] confirmed
[18:04] anyone can say anything they wish to
[18:07] now now we know people people have said
[18:09] all kinds of people have said they have
[18:10] discernment they've said they had the
[18:12] Holy Ghost they said they're called to
[18:13] preach all these sorts of things
[18:15] but it's got to be proved out right
[18:17] anyone can say anything they wish to and
[18:20] they can have impressions
[18:21] but when God really sins something
[18:24] people vindicate that to be the truth
[18:28] God will speak of it
[18:30] oh you you think now when the God sends
[18:33] the Holy Ghost had fire in your life
[18:35] then he begins to speak back to testify
[18:39] that you really got it that the life is
[18:42] in you
[18:43] now see when when Gabe Abel coming he
[18:45] brought that he brought that uh he
[18:47] brought his sacrifice and laid it up
[18:48] there on the altar then see he was
[18:51] waiting for God to speak back when God
[18:53] speaks back it proves that Faith really
[18:56] is there the Bible said in Hebrews God
[18:59] testifying of his gifts Hebrews 11 10 is
[19:02] that right God testifying then you got
[19:05] God's testimony the holy spirit is the
[19:09] gift of God
[19:10] you believe it when he comes to you he
[19:12] will testify
[19:13] that is there all God's gifts testify
[19:18] and the angel of God he said now if I
[19:20] make these statements and then and I
[19:22] just make them myself there's nothing of
[19:23] that to happen then don't believe it
[19:25] because my words would be untrue but if
[19:27] I make those statements and God backs
[19:29] that up then that's God's testimony to
[19:32] it is that right that's God's testimony
[19:35] saying that it is true well then if God
[19:38] says it's true and confirming the word
[19:41] with signs and wonders following isn't
[19:44] that what you prayed for for years oh
[19:47] you to think about that we're not just
[19:49] following the ideas of a man we're
[19:51] following a Vindicated message where
[19:53] somebody didn't get up and just say some
[19:55] words but God come behind it and
[19:58] Vindicated it and not only the message
[20:00] but he'll come behind your life and
[20:02] vindicate it he'll come behind your
[20:04] faith and vindicate your faith that it's
[20:06] true that you really believe what what
[20:08] with a supernatural testimony God
[20:11] speaking back over your life to prove
[20:13] that God is with you
[20:16] in Revelation chapter four brother
[20:17] Randall said now to you my Baptist
[20:19] brother I want to ask you something you
[20:21] say what more could Abraham do but
[20:22] believe God and God imputed him for
[20:25] righteousness that's only you thing you
[20:26] can do is believe but God's got to
[20:29] answer back that it's that it really is
[20:31] faith no don't we want our faith
[20:34] inspected this morning God's respect and
[20:37] God God will come by and and inspect it
[20:40] and look it over and see if it's really
[20:41] his faith and real and then come and
[20:43] vindicate it and prove it with something
[20:46] Supernatural happen in your life that's
[20:48] all he could do right there right here
[20:50] he believed God but God to accept his
[20:52] belief given the Seal of circumcision
[20:55] and sealed him showing that God had
[20:58] accepted his faith and you if you
[21:00] profess faith in God and has never been
[21:02] sealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 30
[21:05] says if you want to put it down grieve
[21:07] not the holy spirit of God whereby you
[21:09] are sealed and you're not sealed until
[21:10] you have received the Holy Ghost oh when
[21:13] God comes and accepts your faith and
[21:15] begins to change the directory of her
[21:17] life and makes you want to come to
[21:18] church and make you want want for the
[21:21] preacher the preacher a little bit
[21:22] longer because there's something
[21:23] hungering in you and the only way that
[21:25] you can explain that is something
[21:26] Supernatural happened in my life that
[21:28] you started off believing and God come
[21:30] and did something super nice to me make
[21:32] you act different and think different
[21:34] and walk different and talk different
[21:36] and want to associate with different
[21:38] people and live around different people
[21:39] and everything's different because
[21:41] something Supernatural happened
[21:44] brother I'm saying I got all these
[21:46] quotes without without the what message
[21:48] it came from so you just have to you can
[21:50] ask me later if you want the the message
[21:52] she said you believe on the Lord Jesus
[21:54] Christ accept him as your personal
[21:56] Savior and then receive the Holy Ghost
[21:58] and until you have received the Holy
[22:00] Ghost God has never recognized your
[22:03] faith that's right
[22:05] now you are a Believer but God doesn't
[22:07] recognize your faith until he proves it
[22:09] to you amen it might be recognized in
[22:11] your own thoughts but when he comes when
[22:13] it comes into God's thoughts God seals
[22:15] that Faith by the baptism of the Holy
[22:17] Ghost
[22:18] and that's the same thing it is when God
[22:20] recognizes your faith and he cuts the
[22:22] world off of you and give you the Holy
[22:24] Ghost and you really believe God then
[22:26] for whatever he says now now maybe some
[22:30] of the old-timers sitting here will
[22:31] maybe your cab is down and say well he's
[22:33] talking about the old the Holy Ghost and
[22:34] maybe I I just don't let's go on beyond
[22:37] that and think think in larger terms for
[22:41] God to come and vindicate your faith by
[22:43] taking you out of this world you got to
[22:45] have fracturing faith for God to come
[22:48] and vindicate your life with a
[22:50] supernatural anointing you've got to
[22:51] have Capstone Faith see it builds up the
[22:54] re the way we're going to get out of
[22:56] here is the same way we got born again
[22:58] the way that you get the Holy Ghost is
[23:00] with your faith the way that you get the
[23:02] Capstone is with your faith and how does
[23:04] faith come by the word so to raise your
[23:08] faith you've got to hear the word and
[23:09] the more word that you pack in the more
[23:11] word that you're believing your faith
[23:13] increases to a place where you can
[23:16] believe that all things are possible it
[23:18] doesn't matter what the circumstances
[23:20] say it doesn't matter what I appear
[23:21] would it matter how I feel that I
[23:24] believe that if God said it it's going
[23:26] to come to pass I don't believe how I
[23:28] feel I believe what God's saying
[23:33] okay
[23:36] we got two more minutes or I'll say two
[23:40] more we got a few more minutes but we'll
[23:41] close in two minutes and brother Brown
[23:43] said and I wear a story he said now look
[23:45] what Cain done when he's seen his
[23:47] brother was accepted his brother had
[23:49] what not just a lot of head knowledge
[23:51] not just a lot of Education his brother
[23:54] had the supernatural revelation
[23:58] now that's what we're here for
[24:00] we're here for something Supernatural to
[24:02] happen that's what I'm looking for a
[24:04] supernatural change in my life
[24:05] Supernatural change in my thinking I'm
[24:07] looking for something Supernatural don't
[24:10] never get away from expecting a
[24:12] supernatural move of God
[24:14] and then it when Cain saw that then he
[24:17] was jealous over him and saw a way to
[24:20] kill him to think about that that when
[24:22] God would come down and supernaturally
[24:24] vindicate now you can see that in a lot
[24:27] of people's lives God will come down and
[24:29] supernaturally feel somebody with a Holy
[24:31] Ghost and all his friends will start to
[24:32] hate him
[24:33] supernaturally vindicate a preacher and
[24:36] all the other preachers will start to
[24:37] hate him Supernatural vindicates
[24:39] somebody's life and the people at work
[24:40] will start to hate him Supernatural
[24:43] Vindication is what caused Cain to start
[24:45] hating Abel and brother or whether
[24:47] dictionary definition of Supernatural as
[24:49] a musicians come Supernatural is when a
[24:52] manifestation or event attributed to
[24:54] some Force Beyond scientific
[24:57] understanding or the laws of nature you
[25:00] can't explain it by science you can't
[25:02] explain it by schooling you can't
[25:04] explain it by somebody giving you a good
[25:06] reason there's something when you're
[25:08] healed or cancer or sealed of the way
[25:11] that you think something's changed God's
[25:14] come on the scene God bless you
[25:17] [Applause]
