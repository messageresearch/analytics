Lord he's going to give us what we need what now on Sunday a gender reveal party oh a gender reveal party okay all right yours are brother Anderson's oh okay okay all right Romans 8 Genesis 3 father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and the hour that we're living we thank you for grace and guidance thank you for peace and joy in our hearts Thank You For You Lord we love you and we thank you that you are the one that has chosen us to be in the end time here to receive your word we know that it was because that we chose to receive it and that way then you would have it ready for us we love you and we thank you as we read your word you come to us and speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us Lord in your grace in Jesus name amen Romans 8 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them who them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen all right let's go to Genesis 3 and we'll begin reading with verse one now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman ye hath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and the one the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant for the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons amen you may be seated Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been speaking for a while or quite a while now on how does God predestinate and we spent a lot of time covering for knowledge getting that in the straight way because you know see being that for knowledge is first and then by his forn knowledge he could predestinate so we laid those things in order then we went through the the uh it going back into the Eternal mind of God and and coming this away in his thoughts and knowing then that uh really predestination which means Destiny set beforehand it didn't come into view in in heaven predestination came into view as the were were coming down this way it did with Lucifer and that he knew when he made him that he would make the wrong choice all right but it mainly predestination determin is the destiny determined of mankind and Mankind was not into being back there so then when you come and bring mankind into being then you can start talking about predestination all right so that's what we we've been uh trying to speak about you've got to cover it by forn knowledge first amen sir right amen so then what would be a predestinated seed would it be a physical does it have to be those things and keep that in mind because that's what we're trying to cover now we spent this last Sunday afternoon talking about the seed of the serpent and how that that seed of the serpent was Satan trying to get Eve to reason on what God had said amen all right because the seed of the serpent now follow me through tonight's message real carefully in the way I'm bringing it now because you'll see what I'm talking about the seed of the serpent h Cain was not the seed of the serpent physically speaking physically corporately speaking he was the seed of the Beast all right but he's called seed of The Serpent and that's why that when we get around to it and I know people then will hear it on the internet now and you'll know where I'm headed all mankind then in the fall winds up being physically speaking the seed of the serpent because we've come both ways so now watch tonight as we go through the message the seed of the serpent is a spiritual condition right because the serpent does not have a physical seed to plant amen right you know when I'm talking about the devil the serpent all right but you start off with the seed of the serpent being spiritual now tonight we're going to have to take it bringing it from spiritual into a natural uh thing and then we'll still call it in the prophet will and the Bible will speak of it as the seed of the serpent because it'll wind up being that so now when we go through it you remember what we're trying to bring that we've got to bring first the seed of the serpent as the reasoning factors and everything to be perverted then we go to the physical part heart which would actually bring in the seed of the beast but it'll still be called a seed of the serpent because that way you go from a spiritual to a natural all right now keep that in mind don't lose me in the message when I start going through now you remember that Adam in his original con creation being part of the original creation he could not sin right he could not be tempted in that state that he was in so he had to be brought into another condition or state of being to bring in the physical things that we'll talk about later all right but just remember that RMA gave it to you on the flashing red lights of his coming paragraph 114 Adam could not not be tempted he was in the original right all right now the original creation was what male and female male and female male and female all right the original condition then coming up to Adam was male and female in one being right but at that position or a situation the prophet would tell you that original creation came from fall the animals don't fall they're under the fall because of us all right so then the prophet says on marriage and divorce paragraph 162 I gave these Sunday so quoting them the original creation of God could not sin right so you're going to have to watch Adam coming into a position or a situation that will lower him from his highly office now watch what I'm saying listen very carefully just because Eve was taken from Adam that's not the situation right that brought about a condition of existence but that wouldn't Adam situation you mean she was in him and taken out of him and then he could fall no you got to remember the all comes through the spiritual and the natural to Eve then you fall back to Adam right that was not deceived right he knew exactly what he was doing he wasn't put into a sinful condition because of Eve being taken from him no that wouldn't work Adam in the original still couldn't fall right so what did he do and you'll see then why that that there's so much in it that the Bible says then Adam all die y right see he sold out amen the human race now to try to explain that is one situation don't think just because you have the new birth that's right that you can't do wrong right and you ever get that in your mind you are on the devil's grounds headed for a horrible pit because you've taken his lie right so let's get it in the right order now and bring it out all right see sin never originated on Earth sin originated in heaven all right then came down to earth and the greatest ever battle ever fought we were covering it and begin in the human mind paragraphs 6768 6970 of the greatest battle ever fought and when it did Satan meets you now here's something I want to explain and it'll help you if you go listen to like the greatest battle ever fought or any message you find brother brandham explaining something of an overall picture the greatest battle ever fought he spins and I what I'm preaching now just a background I'd invite you to read that message over and over and over I've done listening to it twice this week s on a deer stand yesterday listened to it my wife and I listened last night besides all the reading because see there's a whole lot more in the book where he's dealing with you and I to be able to conquer these things that the fall has brought upon us that's right right yes sir see the greatest battle ever fought is still going on amen amen it wasn't just with Eve and then that ended it no the greatest battle ever fought the prophet said is still going on right now right that's right and that's why I've constantly Used 2 Corinthians 11:3 where that we would not be deceived like Eve we now Paul's speaking to Christians right what do you think's putting us in the grave right amen what is taking us down right it's not in the basis of sin like sin like unbelief a lot of it there's a lot of that but a lot of it is the the people in the lack of understanding so you don't want to put it in a class of Sinners right you put it in the class of lack of understanding lack of knowing these things you know the not not knowing them we've had 40 something years to to come around to knowing it but still you know amen I see the the message as a whole and I'm talking about what I know as being to worse or shape than it was in the late 60s and early 70s amen at least people had a desire a drive uh uh wanting to go forward but you see it now is just dropping down just all right and see sight and time wouldn't that what the prophet saiden God's two worst enemies s and time is let thing go let it go for a while and you just become relaxed become at as at ease and not as not as uh and I don't use the word dedicated as to the point of of not going to church and doing I'm talking about what is our desire in our hearts that's right we talk of a Rapture that we wish would take place I was asked the other day to look up some things where the Prophet had said something one time about somebody said it now I've never read it I don't know but said that they had a place up in Alaska for us to be sent to you know well you know it might be a good thing to send us all there right that's right right it might change things a lot y the prophet did say the church does better what under persecution amen we're not looking for no tribulation no no we could every one be sent to Alaska and go up to Rapture from there that ain't got nothing to to do with it but that's where the reasoning factors of mankind has got in it and the worst thing today is you know and this is a point I've been trying to past a couple of messages is we reason about things you know and we we're we're taking instead of it being the word says we're trying to reason that out and when you do you can get in a trap with the devil just like Eve was all right see you might wonder why would I spend so much time trying to express something to you but you know it hasn't been no accident that all of these visitors has been coming you know to where I'd have to back up amen right well you didn't have to back up for me that's about right cuz some of you wouldn't he to back up you know all right that's just the truth but you see you get offended at me for telling you the truth what would it been 40 years ago well brother Dale you're just not like me CU yeah I'm 73 I'm like some of you but you know my desire has never been but one thing move on Amen in the word right move on why the prophet said with the restoration of the word comes a restoration of power amen now did he mean that with the restoration of the computers all though that's a part of it and a wonderful thing amen the ability to get the message when we used to scrs to try to get one book see we would go to Jeffersonville just to get a book you know but do we value those books and things now like we did to begin with that's the point amen CU you see with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of power and I spent a lot of time past couple of messages talking about where brother brandham and his early Ministry would say Body Soul spirit and in his last part of his ministry would say Body Spirit and soul and in doing that I've tried to get you to remember one thing no matter what he called the position or placing or whatever you want to call it he always gave the body five senses see taste feel smelling here he always gave the second realm of mankind memory reason conscience affections he always gave the third real of man one sense either Faith or doubt just go see what he's talking about in the senses amen and you'll see what he's talking about you said well he never corrected that he didn't have to right right but I'll say it this way maybe that's God's way of blinding the eyes of people now I do not believe that brother random could blind anybody's eyes and be right I don't believe that I know the quotes where he said there's too many following this message and he preached serpent seed did he preach serpent seed to drive them off the M no he knew when he preached it he drive them away he knew that that when he spoke and nailed it down that it would drive people away he gets over to the seal book and he gets to the seventh seal he said this will drive thousands of my friends away from me but did he do something wrong to drive him away or did he preach the truth amen see I know preaching the truth is drove my a lot of people that were my friends away from me that I used to be the number one guy that everybody called and wanted to know what the prophet taught but you see the truth will drive you to a place to walk alone all right but you see I've tried my best to get you to just look at things we went through the Daniel 70 week series looking at what the prophet had said taking everything he said and see how perfect it come out but how many people wants it no but it's like I said the other day they say I I don't believe what you believe but I don't know how to explain it or to tell you how wrong you are now how do you know I'm wrong right yeah I mean well I just know you're wrong well how that's I'm stubborn but that's stupidity that's right all right but now listen to just think about what we're talking about tonight to just think about that body Spirit soul body Soul Spirit just get the senses in the correct order right and when you read your Bible go read it I'm ask you to study the word spirit in the Bible and see it even take your strong concordance to get to definition even take your your uh emphatic diglot your your uh the ones to to bringing it down take it and use the word spirit and see if there's any difference between the spirit of man and the spirit of God As far as the definition of the word look at the word Soul it says there one time that all the souls in the sea well there must be people living out in the sea the word Soul comes from life right and can be used and I'm quoting from the definition of it it can be used as animalistic life if you want to use the word Soul all right go look it up it means life but now when you read in the Bible and Jesus said my soul is troubled was that just life no you know what's right you remember the prophet saying that our English language was so hard to keep straight and you remember the definition I gave to you of what I think see when you say Bor you know plank board board you say well our definition of that can be a lot of things that's right cuz we can say come on board stand on the board cuz I'm bored with you all that spell the same but I just gave you the definition of what I'm meaning read the before and the after and you'll get the understanding of what's being said right Jesus was hanging on the cross when he said into thy hands I commend my spirit that shouldn't be no problem of understanding what was fixing to take place right see that's what I'm trying to get you to do is read for yourself and let the Holy Spirit give you the right answer because of the situation you're talking about as I said I could say come on board stand on this board pay your board cuz I'm bored with you well there's nothing no problem with anybody what I say it is it I used the same word three four times there there's no problem with what I said see that's the way I see the message amen we read it and instead of trying to get the context or the thought of what's being said we just read it y well that that won't give you anything that this Mass confusion to us but now think about it this is what we saying what we talked about Sunday we talked about the seed of the serpent all right and how that that seed of the serpent was the reasoning factors of the devil trying to reason with Eve and that's still going on right here tonight today amen see the body of Cain never came from the devil no it came from the Beast right but see then that way just don't forget when we start going through it uh there's a quote somewhere I've got it laid on the desk but brother R says you think that the the seed of the serpent is just spiritual I forgot to bring that and had lay on the death he said no it's literal cuz he says every nation in the world he said the seed of the serpent has went into every nation of the world and said every nation of the world is controlled by the seed of The Serpent and you know what he's talking about physical people right so I don't lose me tonight if I'm going through and I I don't backward and for it I try to do that to keep it lined up you know that if I'm going from natural to spiritual I try to tell you or vice versa but just remember the seed of the serpent was first e reasoning factors working through the devil talking to her the literal part came later no telling how long before it came into being all right he said well we know these things that's good but sometimes we need visitors where we can go back over remember now 2 Corinthians 11:3 but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begil Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ can I say it this way that our minds would become corrupted from the Simplicity that is in the revealed word or the word of God is that all right because see that's what he's saying right Christ the revealed word amen what happened to the church back there come on what happened to the church back there I know they tried to change the wording in the seal book later to make it work out but it won't it won't do it even my brother tried to change mine and I told him leave it alone but he went ahead and changed it on my computer and I said don't don't do it you know that brother brandham says and I know I said this here and couple of Brothers differed with me about it that's all right I still believe that that early church under the line l i o n Ministry of Jesus Christ went to NAA because the first four ages was the complete word that's your Prophet now right amen all right see they went to n yeah with the intentions of trying to help oh yeah that's fine but the prophet said they shouldn't have never went down there amen they not have went down there why because it already getting the false doctrines in into amen right and they came out of there with those ideas in their mind remember I told you 325 ad they was not arguing over one God or three read it they was arguing over whether Jesus was God or a like substance the first Nan Creed declared that he was the substance of God read it in your go home and run in Nan Creed but then he had done laid that word into the minds of the people and they took it home with them the church went into the ground right under the line ministry that's right you know what I mean line line the ox man the eagle remember the combat beast and things that's right amen and they wanted to change it and call it lying lying spirit I told him I said leave mind alone cuz that's that's line that's the ministry there's under so somebody lied to him but the lying didn't lie to him they took somebody else's lie the line was the ministry of Jesus Christ all right so see then it's so easily that the same situation is existing as I said Paul is saying through his subtility like he did Eve he wasn't talking about physical adulterous acts he was talking to Born Again Christians right that were listening to the devil and now let me emphasize that a little when uh when brother Randon said that the white horse rider was a holy spirit right he taught that in his early ministry right before the seals broke white horse rider was holy spirit all right but then when the seal broke he's seen it was the Antichrist all right now suppose you only had the tapes of up until 62 or something and you're preaching to your people that the white horse rider is the holy spirit oh bless God let me in I'll bust that up you know well let me go you know that in the book of Acts I believe it's 19 I think when Paul goes over to the people you know and they were teaching that Jesus was the Christ you remember coming from the baptism of John the producing of Christ Paul didn't I tell you what y bunch of heathen Paul simply said let me tell you a little something because there's been further advancement since then and we have more clarity and said that was a day your people are fine you're wonderful you existed under that you're believing that Christ is right I said now let's go a little further right he's already died John's dead now too and said the Holy Ghost has come back do you get what I mean some people they don't understand this message because that they're hindered by the preachers that preach to them am because they don't have the ability to receive it when I went to the Philippines I I told you I said you just cry when you go and those Brothers had had begin to get an ability to argue about the the two Soul Doctrine because somebody had sent them a bunch of books well you know what before then they could just you could just quote brother R said so and said what are you going to say you know what are you going to say right but you see church we don't have that reason here to say that we haven't had the ability to at least receive receive the message and we've tried to to you know bring it to the clarity and get us into the place of understanding amen but get us to a place of like what I said we're doing tonight I can say see to The Serpent and I can be talking about Eve and talking to the serpent the snake but yet the devil inside of that snake was getting H to reason right you know that Beast it was know right that's right then I can say but you know what other things happened and it's the seed of the serpent cuz see there's only two seeds amen the seed of God and the seed of the serpent amen right I won't have enough time tonight and I won't get to it Sunday so we give you a little time to think you know that brother talks about the two trees and he calls Eve the tree amen but he you better read him real careful I can give you a direct quote that Eve would be the seed of a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil let me recorrect that that Eve would be the wrong tree and said man was the right tree you believe I can give that quote but you know what he ain't talking about you come on he ain't talking about no man like me and you he's talking about the man Christ Jesus that's right you can say well I got a quote the man was that other tree look at that he's tree of life and she's tree of death that's send the message sure people y you see brother randam never called The Man a physical man Adam he always called the man that I can find as to be Christ because those two trees are still here right right but think about it now through the simp licity of the revealed word even with the day and the hour that we have the ability to search what does the prophet say we have the ability to search it but yet where is the reality of of Truth you know where does it dwell let us start cuz I've had these and I give them and Highway give them or whatever let's read a little bit from the greatest battle ever fought and just listen to the prophet show you what happened to Eve all right but remember he's talking about what's happening to you and I right now we're going to read it is still taking place it didn't end with Eve and the whole thing's over with oh bless God we don't have no trouble no it's got worse amen the devil is more deceiving today what is it the scripture where talking about uh in the the children of Disobedience brother BR said look how deceiving it was in a child he said what about when it's in a man right right right so you and I are facing Satan with everything that he's got to pour on to us amen that's right quoting the message to us yep but somebody's going to overcome it am look what he says explaining what happened to Eve and remember he said draw you out three circles he said the outer real is see taste feel smelling ear second real is memory reason conscious affections all of that you know let third real is either one fa one thing Faith or doubt it's not faith and doubt cuz that's a two Soul doctrine that the devil was in your soul God was in your soul your soul was already Eternal but the devil is there you had to drive the devil out I said you don't have to do that is hit the man in the head you see that's being smart elic it's a truth right why worry about salvation and just hit him in the head they're going to kill Old Devil he said yeah but you don't make it you know that's what inter terance was talking about the other day and he said I don't understand how come anybody could believe that you come with eternal life when Jesus Christ had to die right now I don't understand that that's just plain language Ain it he had to die to give us eternal life that's just plain simple you know it takes away a lot of the problem then somebody just preach all they want to and you just sitting there saying run on I'll catch up we in a little bit I've enjoyed so far but I'll catch that we after a while cuz I don't agree with that right like one brother came here one night he was just preaching away and all at once he hit something and when he did everybody in the building just went we got down to the house he said y'all was really with me up so far said when I brought out so and so said everybody said I said yeah we don't believe it I said we don't believe that he said I thought everybody believed that I said well you know we don't amen so you know why you shall know the truth right amen and the truth shall set you free amen all right let's talk about Eve now but remember we're talking about us that's right right amen this is taken from paragraph 62 I mean paragra 109 starting there 110 of the greatest battle ever fought preached in 62 311 your conscious has even gone to that and that's not talking about Eve is it you see what I'm telling you don't listen to the greatest battle ever fought or read it to just find out what happened happened to Eve yeah you got a lot in there what's happening to you and I what's he saying your M your conscience is even gone to that why CU brother R said he said if we can get this this little thing fixed he said there won't be a sick person in this building or a person seeking the Holy Ghost in five minutes he said if we can get it fixed you know what and never got it fixed right right so where are we at your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clean it shouts Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to God it shines out certainly just is clear Clean and Clear for the word of God to work through the power of God see and that's the main thing right so there's nothing wrong with see taste feel smell and hear if it stays on faith do you want that it's in this message there's nothing wrong with memory reason conscious affection and love or whatever the five you want to name as long as it's with God's word amen that's part of our doing that's what he's working through he's got to work through the same factors that Satan Works through to take us down right all right he said there's your background a Battleground your Battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul now watch him oh but that's in the soul back in your mind it opens to the mind is the gate to the soul watch him the gate to the spirit rather that's exactly right your mind open opens up and accepts the spirit or it rejects the spirit your mind brain do you need that quote from back what he says your mind is your brain your brain opens up to accept the Holy Spirit or to reject the Holy Spirit your brain does Satan Works through our brain God works through our brain no God just Pours Down in my soul now the Bible says faith comes by hearing all right now watch you can have little consciences little feelings little Sensations and all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just a little Sensations and things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friend he said God let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience now you're inside coming back out right mind brain out here God trying to get in but there something got to work coming out right the channels it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and it listens to your conscience where's that second rim or do you want to call it Soul or you want to call it Spirit listens to your affections second real but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in what it blows the rest of the stuff out now when we let the spirit of God come in the spirit of his word the revealed word is the only thing that drives out unbelief the letter of the word don't drive out unbelief right no come on the revealed word drives out unbelief okay and what blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone ever since ation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that you remember Jesus get behind me S right no sir he cannot battle against it now he knows that's true what about the devil knowing what's truth so these battles has raged since the day of the Garden of Eden the battle in the human mind Satan started it what did he do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's word he white wased it right he stopped up some little channels here somewhere okay he said but surely go Genesis 3:1 surely God all these things that that he he promised he know the word was right but he know he could he couldn't just come right after and blast it out blur it like that but he he he sugarcoated it remember what I was bringing out Sunday afternoon I hope you recorded that one the devil wasn't trying to tell Eve who he was oh no that's right uh-uh no he was trying to tell her who she was that's what got her t tantalizing information right smooth talking I've seen old boys and I don't mean this wrong now so I always get in trouble saying what I mean so just go ahead I've seen old boys Sugar talk big old fat girls see them do it to a lot of others too but you know what they got them in just a little bit they just what is what they're the they're the tops man no still a fat girl you say you shouldn't say those why not it's true but you know if he can do it with the fat on what he can do with the skinny ones it's the same thing sugar Co it like I said guys at work every day they don't come in stinking like a horse women at work don't come in stinking like everything else but then they get together and they pour out their petty little things you know my husband's not good to me well he ought to be as pretty as you are a beautiful girl like you your husband ought to be happy to have somebody like you now don't tell me you don't know about flattery flattery will get you by where you want to go absolutely right amen but you see church we don't want to think about those things do we no we want to get on to something else okay let's go ahead then look at look at paragraph 115 number two brother the battle rised when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasonings that's the flu it come in now what real is he talking about reasonings second real whether he called it Soul or whether he calls it spirit second real I keep saying that over and over because I know the human mind and how it slips you know especially when you go to sleep and wake up and can't figure out what somebody talking about that's the channel that run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned she in her second real she reasoned right her eyes was s she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her own husband he was the most subtle of all the Beast of the field and it was probably a fair man than her husband he looked like a great masculine Beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was and first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reasonings caught it why wouldn't that be a thrill that's the same thing he does to a woman today some woman with a lovely little husband finds some great big masculine man this man will try to open up the reasons remember that's Satan that's a devil or vice versa man to woman right woman to man either way what does it do working that reasoning power the conscience are something begins to move through that's why a lot of you don't like the way that our hammer it but you are just born again in your soul you're not born again in your body and spirit your body and spirit is only under subjection to the soul but remember it's under subjection to the guy that's coming in from the outside also right now you don't like that no but you tell me if that ain't right right right when you get into the reasoning memory conscience Etc of mankind you're going to reason it out and you're going to reason against truth all right let's go ahead and look at number three the contest 1962 1231 paragraphs 16- 18 now Eve be to stop to reason and when he quoted the word she quoted the word to him God said you should not eat thereof for the day you eat thereof that day you we die and Satan never disagreed with her he said certainly that's right but he said you see you need some new light something a little different from what God Said why is it that you always see these young ones come in the message preachers and they come out with these new doctrines and everybody runs after them new light right something a little different from what God Said you know I think brother Rand should have said this or already have said that right and if you do do it you'll be just a little smarter your eyes will be opened but she said well God said we would die he said oh surely see there you come just that much surely you won't die but God said you would and that settles it and that that broke the great tug of war then and pulled the whole human race into death because Eve listened to a Reas a reasoning against God's work that's a shame that she did it but it's done ped but now we're still fortified amen and that link was made up in Christ Jesus we know that G God gave us our best defense just simply to trust his word that's just too simple though is it 40 something Years brother Dale you just been preaching the same old message and you ain't run after these two Lords Two Souls seventh under vir brues all of the no I didn't why because something told me it wasn't right amen well who do you think you are I'm me who Do You Think You Are what does that solve that's right you see Church you can't say that I've been off the message you might not agree with my Approach and honestly speaking sometimes I probably don't agree myself but I try my best to stay with what the prophet is talk amen and put it in the Bible to where that is it's anchored there all right look what Eve done the way of a true Prophet 6319 paragraph 173 176 177 and Eve let down the bars she began to reason Satan said like this now year you don't know you haven't had any schooling yet I'm the professor of the Seminary out here his own and I tell you we've learned some things out there we've learned that God is good we learned in our Seminary that God is so good he don't expect you to do all he wrote there he doesn't expect that now that's what the devil is telling Eve but is that what he's telling us now she made a good preacher watch oh yeah but she said the Lord God said now she'd have made a good preacher if she'd have stayed on that if she'd have stayed with what God Said but that's why he put her out wouldn't let her preach right keep her away from it all right but you say with brother Dale what I don't like about you and what I don't like about the preachers in this message is you won't you tell us that we have no right to think well I didn't tell you that the prophet did you get mad at me for finding it go ahead and run to next one brother the world falling apart preaching 62 1216 paragraph 159 the church wants one they want their pieces about waved about with every wi of Doctrine to everything sweeps around one of them say oh I think all we have to do you think you ain't got no think coming if you think that's the only time he said that run in there you ain't got just put think coming in your computer he said it about three or four times he wouldn't play with words he wouldn't just you know think coming that's look God's done expressed his thoughts you ain't got no right to think now if you're going to be a Christian right right now if you're not you can take all you want to Y right but if you're going to be a Christian all right why why is it you don't have a right to think let the mind that was in Christ be in you let him think and he purposed and done the will of God he said if I do not the works of God then don't believe me see you ain't got no think coming he's the one does the thinking now that's Christians but oh how we love to sit in that little part of reasoning memories and conscience and affections but don't you think that brother so and so is a good preacher well praise the lord it's like my wife there's a lady said to her one time talking about a man over in India and said boy we would have watch not say nothing about him don't don't say nothing about that man she said is he off the message does he believe brother Brown's said no he don't believe brother Brown's she said well I can talk about him that's right right why because it's it's either Truth Or Not truth amen see look what he said let his mind be in you you just think the same and that's his word how how you going to think different he's done expressed his thoughts to us but we want to do our thinking I think they ought to do this we have no right to think why because you enter right straight into the Realms that Satan wants us in when we try to reason out things we try to figure it out I've tried to tell you many times about a simple Ministry God has given me I Don't Preach nothing until it's revealed right and when it's revealed it's open to the world if it's been revealed to me I don't worry about it that a lot of things ain't been revealed to me sounds real beautiful I ain't going to preach on it when I preach on it you can Bank it and say it's revealed to him you say well everybody says that I agree with you I never heard a preacher yet say that God didn't reveal the word to him have you I mean have you ever heard one the devil told me this but I'm going preaching no no no it don't work that way folks everybody thinks they got the truth right right but will they stand the test amen what was it brother R said he said I'll be glad to see the day that you'll stand up and say that's not what Paul preached right glad somebody will do that but think about it now let's jump over I wondered today and it word all day trying to figure out how to present things so let's just read what happened in the garden I'll get back to these other quotes Brothers later so we read when we started out in Genesis we read what happened and the things you know and let's start on Genesis 3 and 8 which will be number eight brothers and watch after the situation had happened the things had been done look where we start off and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden now why did they hide if they was right you know what brother random said he said Adam and Eve was back in the bushes having Church what he said you want to take go said they were back in there having church that's right you know what Eve was still trying her best to tell Adam that she was right now I didn't quote it brother Brown was one that said and she still thinks she's right all right now they hid themselves from the presence of the Lord they must have been must have know is wrong but let's bring that over to here let's bring it over to our day people walk right up in the presence of God we're going to read about a man doing it but what about today we got the truth you got to come to our church you got to come to our way of seeing the message right well brother Dale that's what you say show me the tape I've said we got to stay with the truth right yes sir re but I ain't never said you got to come to Lula right now but get my point when it first happened they were hiding but after a while things starts changing Cain right in the presence of God he said am I My Brother's Keeper right in the presence of God that he had just killed the man didn't take long for the embarrassment to wipe off did it that's why the best thing to do when you feel embarrassed or you feel bad about something you've done best thing to do is get rid of it right then cuz if you don't an hour later it's going to start being the other person's fault instead of you how many times have I expressed that okay just looking at the scriptures what happened and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou instead of brother Brown said instead of Adam and Eve running hunting God it was God having to hunt Adam right and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and was afraid why was he afraid because I was naked right I was afraid because I was naked and he didn't know he's naked before so he surely wouldn't eat an apple right some fruit we'll get to that more in a minute I was naked and hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked that's what God Said to Adam look hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat truee of knowledge of Good and Evil would let them know that's naked right Tree of Life lets you know you're clothed amen right and the man said the woman he didn't need say wife now we had done read back up here before there that it talks about uh where was it uh verse 8 it says Adam and his wife hid themselves now when he gets down to hear he's backing up right and what does he say and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat she was defiled right begal we got some scriptures in a minute on it and the Lord God now watch immediately as quick as Eve said she's what the serpent begal her he doesn't jump onto her and onto Adam right he turns right to the Beast right now watch this a little bit about the Beast and the Lord God said unto the serpent remember he was a beast he gets to be a snake by belly and all that remember the serpent was the most subtle of all these you remember the scriptures the Lord God said unto the serpent now I'd like for you to think about one thing I I'd like to preach about an hour and a half tonight right there on the Lord God because no matter what they done now I know why that couldn't go on no matter what they done he never went back to the title of God right how much how long have I preached it start off in Genesis one you got God all the way through 33 times and then you start off as quick as you start talking about man and the coming into being of man he goes to lord god Jehovah Elohim Jehovah f um father with his family now I won't ask you the question so I just won't mention let get to it all right the Lord God said unto the serpent because I has done this Thou Art cursed I want you to show me where he ever cursed Adam and Eve I got brother randam said where where he said he didn't you said look like it it does look like he' curs this a poor old animal and you know what brother Rand said about the animal we'll get to it next time I preach on it he said the animal was used to bring the fall he said the animal had to become the sacrifice amen and the poor old animal's a dumb animal they couldn't have what it done right do you know I'll get to it in a minute you know for a man or a woman to lay with a beast is death let's it's in numbers I'll get to it in a minute and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this th curse above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thy crawl and thus shalt thou eat all the days of thy life watch and I'll put enmity between thee and the woman between the Beast and the woman he talking about the Beast and where he gets the curse right switches right back to talking to to the Devil he's talking to the animal here talking to the devil here I'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and brother R said then you tell me that serpent didn't have a seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel that's just speaking of Jesus Christ coming right he turned right to the devil talking to it now watch him roll on that where we get it now he turns to the woman and to the woman he says I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now remember they were coequal to start with but now he's her ruler why and remember if it had been eating apple roll it back down just a little brother first if it had been an apple why and watch now he never cursed her that's in the future home I'll get it just a minute I'll give you the page on not now but 3:25 326 of the future home and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow now that ought prove enough to know what happened she ate apple she already got the belly ache right but he multiplied her sorrow and childbearing why because that's what she'd done and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee kind of perverted today to now so they got women and men and all that doings but don't worry about it what no curse you say that's a curse because she was put no that's not a curse a curse would have been to death that's what I'll get to it in the minute if EV had got what she deserved she'd have been killed right there because the Bible says woman to lay with an animal kill her and the animal It also says if a man does not a curse he never lost a Lord God that's what I said I love to preach on that they never lost the Lord God it was Daddy there was Daddy standing there he didn't say Eve you'll die he didn't say Adam you're dead you're going to die he just told him what life would be like never cursed Eve never cursed Adam you only cursed a beast what and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou sh shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground not cursed Adam cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and cyles shall it bring forth Thou shalt eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shal th eat bread they thou return unto the ground for out of it thou was taken for thust thou art and thust thou shalt return still didn't leave him and Adam called his wife's name Eve she never had a name until then her name was Adam because Eve was the mother of all living okay Eve's the mother of Cain Eve's the mother of Abel right she's a mother of all living amen CU that's the only two two lineages you can run right and unto Adam also and unto his wife that the Lord God make some peptic AC's and put in their stomach because the apples had messed him up not exactly right but get it and unto Adam and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them and the Lord God said behold a man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lastest he put forth his hand and take also over the tree of life and eat and live forever run that in your translation and see it doesn't say Eternal because they would be Sinners you can't have eternal Sinners righten right forever is a space of time right therefore the Lord God sent him from the Garden of Eden to steal the ground from whence where he was given so he drove out drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life little brother said that sword was placed in the side of the Lord Jesus and said from that time the angels are now running us to the Tree of Life right the church a Messengers the angels are running us to the tree of life but not cursed Adam right and not curse Eve curse the ground curse the snake the serpent the Beast look at number 88 which is the one I was quoting 325 3:26 27 of the future home preach 4 802 but that was the closest thing see they can't find that species between a chimpanzee and a man see each one as it's evoluted up from the birds and on up to the monkeys and so forth up to the chimpanzee then there's a lost that was the serpent not a snake every form is lost from him because he was cursed right now God God didn't curse Adam he might have done the same thing but he cursed the Earth thorns and thistles run it on it to make sure they get this on the internet cuz people don't want that one he didn't curse Eve but said Adam would be her ruler now she ain't trying any preaching or anything Adam is a ruler all the days of your life and it's Sor you shall bring your life bring your life into the Earth but he said I'll put enmity between your seat didn't curse her why because Lord God is still there that animal didn't have a soul and Adam and Eve did amen and he never cursed him he stayed the Lord God never went back to God self-existing never done it I go any further I have to take up more but I will give you these scriptures what it's in Leviticus let's go with 8 B and then we'll stop Leviticus 20 and 15 and 16 and if a man lie with a beast he shall surely be put to death and you shall slay the Beast and if a woman approach unto a beast and lie down there unto Thou shalt kill the woman and the Beast they shall surely be put to death their blood shall be upon them but remember that scripture wasn't applied right somebody kept it from being applied oh that was written over there hundreds thousands of years lat uh John 6 3:16 was written a long time ago you believe it you see what it would have been had he cursed them they would have been dead you say well Adam never went with a beast no but he went with a woman that had had the beast but he didn't curse him I love it may not mean a thing to you but God never kept never backed on his word when he made Man In His Image and put him in flesh flesh he made him in his image he was self-existing under the word God but when he made him in flesh he become lord god Jehovah Elohim like a father with his family and he never left his family amen now there's where predestination comes in God would know that mankind would sin he could set everything in order remember the message of the day to bring out to P but he didn't predestinate by his desires because if he had he'd killed Adam and Eve both so he just curse the animal curse the ground put Adam and Eve under a condition that shows what happened shows they didn't eat an apple CU an eve would be the Sorrows of childbearing childbearing is a wonderful thing of bringing into life but there sorrow that goes with it you know sister Anna is getting around to the place now to that little baby in out of there I'll just start kicking the Daylights out of her and the first time you may rub it and say praise the Lord but right in the middle of the night and it kicks and wakes you up you ain't going to harder praise the Lord you're going to say honey go back to sleep Sara makes her to where she had to have a 28 day thing right wound up to be called in bleeding of the wound but you know God would still take that that wound and he would bring Christ through that wound because he kept his word he loved Adam and Eve he knew they'd fall but he knew that they would want to do right we'll get to it later he knew Abel would want to do right but he knew Cain would want to do wrong so he could predestinate not too bad of word is it come on Brothers not too bad of talking about predestination you get it in the right way I hope you understand what I'm getting at just to read the scriptures and just talk about them a little bit and that God never did curse Adam and Eve if he'd have cursed him that would have been the end of it he didn't curse him you know what brother random says at the point happens that where he talking about that they were going that they were let's see how what is the scripture now uh and I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman you know where brother R said that was quoted as being when Adam and Eve was leaving out of the garden see we put it over here he said when the going out of the garden with the bloody skins flapping against her legs and it looked horrible because it looked like it was no hopes said God screamed out and said but I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman I've made a way that's right you're going to be in trouble and you're going to have life and sorrows going to be horrible but I've made a way amen I'm going to come and I'm going to die but you see church we get into those reasoning factors and people will say my God can't die my God can't feel pain my God can't do this this my God can't that you better remember God must have been real back there in the garden because you know what he done he pulled the skins off of those animals amen he killed the animals he no he's just a spirit he just he ain't that he's just a spirit brother Dale he tore them skins off of that animal amen and put it on Adam and Eve must be pretty real I keep getting them little flickers and every once in a while I'm getting closer to being able to preach what I really see come on but you see Church the Bible is Right amen and it tells us what happen we just need to read it right come on let's stand right what do we got 146 in the red book Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all the kingdoms of heart in my heart our kingdoms of a world that's all my that's where we are sinners only myself we Sinners lost but when he becomes Lord of all there's nothing in that Soul God himself anybody have what about the worst situation you can stand and look and see mankind God looking down and seeing Adam and Eve and knowing Jesus be the Lord yet he said I'll put enmity between thy seat the seat of the woman I won't curse you Jesus be the Lord the kingdoms of my heart I guess I only fool myself for I said I had gelded all but in a secret corner of my heart was a kingdom that did not fall I Surrender now make my heart your throne rule it Kingdom great Empire for if you're father everything we know that our
