========================================
i want to see you open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart shining in the light of your glory right your power and love as we sing amen shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy holy amen holy amen and amen amen i want to see him good to see you about in the house of the lord if you like turn in your scriptures turn what we've been reading in romans 7 and then we'll pick up a couple of verses out of first john 2 romans 7 1st john 2. i know you've prayed about these things but remember to pray for wade and june to be flying out going to oklahoma this weekend so remember that and flying back in on monday so keep them in your prayers and just remember pray one for another let's see the uh fellowship meeting will be brother tom crushane's in

weekend and everything all of the fathers and had a good time fishing together and fellowshipping together and eating together and and all that because we didn't get to do much catching fish we'd done a lot of fishing but not much catching but we had a good time together old brother al even got up there with us you know sit around camp with us and we had a good time fellowshipping together so we invite all of you next time to come and be with us i'll tell you we we have a good time doing it we may not catch many fish but we we always have fun doing those things and i appreciate brother tom ernest there preaching the morning service i think that was about the best message that i've heard him preach so i enjoyed it you know and appreciate him coming by amen so remember these remember the announcements and things that are made heavenly father we thank you for your love and your grace and to us thank you for calvary because there was where everything was made and lord it was all finished and it was made a product that we could receive nor just help us to receive it correctly and to believe it lord and to understand and not to put our own thoughts and ideas into these things but to be able to walk in you got each and every one of us forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in your love lord that we may walk in you we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen romans 7 no you're not breathing for i speak to them that know the law have the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband now remember he's talking about law and grace illustrating it with marriage and divorce to bring it to an understanding to show and then showing where the bride of christ and where she stands so then if while her husband lives she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead he is she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man or for my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god and when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter let's go over now to this little scripture that we have here to tie together in our messages and what we've been doing so that would be first john two one and two my little children these things right on to you that you send not if a man is sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the world you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now i want to just try to get something to make sure you understand what i'm saying and then we'll continue on to the thought in to law and grace but i believe that we need an understanding by revelation and that's my thoughts you know we can read something and say we understand this we can say well i believe that i believe that a long time but has it really been revealed to us now that's the point has it really been revealed to us how that the new birth makes us a child of god is that really just dawned on us that's right making us a child of god now we've covered we've been through the scriptures and the things of the prophet's message and and trying to cover it how that we were born kin folks to the devil according to the book of ruth had one closer kin to us than than christ and those things had to be dealt with that were that god had to come himself to give his own life and to dwell in you and i right what a wonderful situation to give a people the new birth eternal life in your soul making that soul just as eternal and just as perfect as god is right now that's a wonderful situation that's that's worthy of all thoughts and ideas and praise and and glory and everything to be able to be thinking about it how that what god has done for you and i am you know in our new birth all right see then coming to see that it was grace that brought that to pisces we talk about abraham having an unconditional covenant you see grace was even back before abraham he said but now well no grace was before the foundation of the world because the bible doesn't say that he wrote the names in the book of life when abraham received the message of the unconditional covenant it was grace before anything ever came into being and that's what i've tried to get us to see on the the new birth and then on the marriage and divorce situation of life is to see that it takes grace and truly it's amazing grace grace grace as zechariah says you know to see that a people can be made totally free and then then comes into being the scripture see he that the son is set free is free indeed now but we know and realize that there's a journey of mankind upon the earth that we are the problem we're the trouble you know we caused to do it we failed but yet depending upon god to come down and by grace but it's see we we talk a lot about grace on the side of the armenian calvinism you know the different things but see grace is what god does for you and i yeah right everything we have or do is a product of grace your home you live in you car you drive your food you ate today and that food being not killing you is a product of grace right around said my whole makeup is grace all right but now remember the bible says not that we're just saved by grace but it says through faith it's not just a a product to just well it's for everybody you know it's not for everybody right because everybody won't receive it it's for everybody that will receive it and that way the thing for him can't say why did you make me this away because god never made us a sinner but by grace he came down and paid the price all right and he gave us an unconditional covenant amen well then see you would automatically say well then if it's unconditional oh i could never be lost no matter how much i do well see that's the point we need to get in our mind to get straight what does it mean to be saved by grace through faith faith is a revelation and through is a journey so then it's not just a lump sum product it's a journey through life and why would we then have any concept or thought of that we could merit anything now we pretty well handle that won't we but then there must be a truth to grace you know there must be a truth because truly we know that it can't be all of the things that are taught and it has to be a an understanding to you and i i'm worried about what anybody else sees and what they do that's up to them it's to you and i personally amen see then grace is unmerited we can use those words right but then what do we use onto those words well i'm saved and it doesn't matter what i do i could never be lost well see if we have that thought in our mind then there must be something wrong with our revelation i got to thank you a lot this week about abraham and i may not even follow my notes whatsoever but you say abraham said he had an unconditional covenant okay i'll go along with you if you understand what you're talking about he said well abraham didn't even repent to get that unconditional covenant you know but what are you calling repentance and what are you calling doing according to my bible it says it abraham believed god and then that believing was imputed unto him for righteousness abraham's justification came on the basis of the fact of what god knew abraham would do now you approach it any other way and how you're going to do it you're going to make a blanket for throwing it out it's just unconditional well then that way god can't condemn anybody to hell if it's like that but i wasn't thinking about abraham that's why i came up with that thought you don't find where abraham got down and repented but he made his sacrifice right and he believed god i'm just laying it down to where we don't have any you know anybody can't come along and say well you just don't know what you're talking about maybe i don't but i truly enjoy thinking the way i do that if it was imputed unto abraham according to the bible it was done because of his believing right he was making the atonement right he was already dealing with the atonement because the time you come to abraham look how long the world had already existed and how much mankind had been making the atonement sure that was even down before moses but yet still they were making the atonement why would you make an atonement if your thoughts were not upon repentance i'm just talking to us tonight okay see we can say well abraham didn't repent he didn't do anything to get it all right that's fine but he'd already been making the atonement he said yeah but he was a heather and you don't know about that no but you don't either so we x out each other mankind had already been making the atonement if you want to go with abraham but my point is when god spoke to abraham abram was his name at that time he believed god now see pro approaching it because that's where we're going to go if we just bypass a lot of this stuff and we'll get right into the scriptures you see there's been an argument of mankind over james saying that abraham was justified by works and then that paul was saying that he was justified by faith well now i've got a couple of quotes in here be glad to read when we get to them or give them to you later but brother brown said they were not contradictory to each other but yet we make it contradictory and see we're going to be one of the two we're going to follow it according to paul are we going to follow it according to james you know to prop up our thoughts to bring a point by our thoughts you know to express what we think to somebody else but when the prophet would say and they're in the same bible and we are supposed to believe the bible that it is not contradictory one to the other but it's the complete revelation of jesus christ then they must be saying the same thing they must be talking about it but yet speaking of it in not two different ways but of things that we look at all right we know the quotes we know the the message and we're quick to say that well paul was speaking of what god saw in abraham and that's true then we turn around and say that james was speaking of what man saw of abraham and it's true so now in that point or that thought why would a christian if we're going to take the one side of faith and the great things or or look at it like that it doesn't matter what i do it's all right i'm saved why would god save it abraham believed him and it was counted unto him for righteousness you know it's odd that as we'll read in a minute that paul in his writing says and concludes his thought the same as james that god counted at righteousness james in his writings says god counted at righteousness but yet seemingly james is talking about his works see then why would a christian why would we need an advocate if we're going to take the stand that it was an unconditional covenant and how that it's no matter what i do i'm saved anyway then what's the purpose of an atonement what's the purpose of an advocate what's the purpose of asking for forgiveness of sin you remember the sister used to be at church with us years ago and i pray that she'll be back before she passes on she said the way y'all preached about god she said then who do i repent too see she caught the thought of us talking about that the bride of christ is god made manifest in flesh but yet she'll know the fact that or didn't hear that we were talking about that we were not the god of glory that begun it all but we were his children we were his offspring can we do that talking about grace that's why i made the point of the new birth that were saved by grace through faith took the same examples of the new birth moved it over into our marital situations of life and showed how god could put those things in his sea of forgetfulness but do we just take it as a well grace what do we think about it see if we do not receive what god has given us then we can't be saved will you agree with that because god won't override your free moral agency but if it's just a blanket of grace unconditional why did he not choose the next door neighbor in the days of abraham that's right why did he not choose somebody else that was a good person down there because abraham come from idolatry or abram did his salvation then just a blanket bestowed out to the world or do we have to accept it right right all right then we found out that by way of the prophet's message that even though we accept him if he does not accept us we don't have the new birth right right all right then i want to ask you a simple question because this is the way i think when the prophet said a pardon is not a pardon unless received is a pardon and it means that we must accept it right all right to be saved to be born again we must accept it to have our marital situations eradicated and put in the sea of forgetfulness we must accept it then he can come back and accept us all right but if we think it's just it doesn't make no difference you know that's once saved always saved that's a good baptist doctrine but at least now they did admit you had to be saved they didn't throw grace out it's just the fact that it was for everybody is for only those that were saved but now if a pardon is not received it's not a pardon are we trying to make grace what kind of a pardon well it don't make no difference i believe brother on the lord jesus christ and he saved me and it now don't make no difference because i'm in an unconditional covenant well now what would have happened or what did happen to the man that you're dealing about a pardon is not a pardon unless received is one they had to make that ruling in the supreme court because the man refused the pardon right that's right he refused to pardon so thereby he was shot by the firing squad see it's not a pardon unless we receive it as one amen grace is not grace unless received no matter what it's for what situation we're talking about you see the way we make grace in our thoughts the man that was in jail sitting there and they offered him the pardon he says i'm saved here's the pardon right he had to pay for work right come on well i know we the man didn't do it because we know why he rejected he thought it was joking with him et cetera et cetera but according to our thoughts of grace the man could have sat there in jail and said i've got to pardon they can't kill me but they did why because he would not accept that pardon for himself and thereby couldn't have been applied unto him see we say it's not what i do or don't do i agree with you but it's whether or not i accept the pardon then because see i know i preach a little different most people do but i believe you're saved by grace through faith that not at work unless any man should boast i agree with that i believe that but i believe once you're born again that born-again experience is totally unconditional except for the point you must accept it and if we don't accept it correctly god doesn't have to accept us right so if i sit in jail as the illustration and i say i'm saved by grace you can't kill me you see then we prove that we don't accept the grace by walking out right because who in his right sense wouldn't get him walk out of jail if they told him he's going to kill him the next morning are you listening see we we want to make grace a the best way i know to say just like it's just a blanket well then nobody's going to hell then but we know that's not true that's why it says you're saved by grace through faith you're not just saying by grace he said grace save me brother amen but you've got to accept the pardon as for you see that way then we can take the scriptures the prophet's message and bring it together to make a beautiful picture that paul is explaining that you're saved by grace but remember it's true faith he's not explaining this to grace is a blanket for anybody just whatever you know he's explaining that you must receive that pardon and if that pardon was not received correctly then it's no good you see i accepted the lord jesus as my savior amen but has he accepted you well i've done all he told me to do well that's good you remember in the book of acts you see why i keep going back to that scripture there in the book of acts the man or the people that they couldn't get the holy ghost to come on they had done everything that was right they were repentant they were baptized and everything was correct but yet something was wrong you see then grace is he said but it's just unmerited favor you don't do anything to get it amen that's right but you must accept it you must believe it you must believe it's for you that's why i said on there when i was preaching about the grace of marriage and divorce if it's not accepted then there you're not free you realize in that then my expression was trying to show that even though your neighbors and everybody in the world knows what you've done yet god don't know what you're doing if you can really believe it but if you keep dilly dallying up and down and having problems of believing then who are you going to blame what are you getting at brother dale grace is not for everybody it's for only those who want it and evidently abraham done a whole lot more than we think because god counted it righteousness the way he believed it but around him used the word justified my and paul uses it about abraham i think james does too but i know for certain paul that said he was justified by faith see then we found justified to be what but the real you never did do it how about it's being so eradicated until you didn't do it brother dale if it's that free i just i just go live like i want to that proves you're not saved right that's not arguing the point of abraham and talking about paul doing that as it said we say well paul abraham didn't repent well maybe he didn't fall down on his knees and beg a lot of forgiveness but he believed god what is forgiveness well i asked the lord to forgive me he forgive me forgiveness is justification no matter what you do if you just ask god to forgive you and really mean it he'll forgive you of that whether ever saves you or not and you won't go to hell for that part why because you repented and god justified you because you wiped your slave clean wouldn't it see if it's forget unless it was totally gone huh but what about it you can't tell me i'm not saved nobody's not trying to tell you you're not saved why are you talking about it you must have been having trouble with it yourself or something because i'm surely not talking about it i'm not trying to do i'm trying to preach so all of us could find out what we are but if the man had to sit in jail and said they cannot and that's what he's doing right he said in there now he didn't say they can't come in here and kill me he just refused to take the pardon if you and i will not accept the pardon and grace of jesus christ there's nothing he can do for us why because it's left it's left into our hands see then sure jonah 2 9 salvation is of the lord we agree with that but after you're saved now what about it i thought we believed the scriptures that we're going to have to give an account of the things we've done but brother dale that's not christians well you go ahead and believe what you want to it's written about christians but brother dale i'll show you where i have no sin good but then what about the scriptures it tells you you're a sinner if you say you have not sinned what does it say about you done you just made god a lie but i thought it was unconditional i changed the title on it brothers back there because you can pull it off i told put on there do not do we sin but we'll just talk about an unconditional covenant brother joe and just write that on it because what does that mean to you an unconditional covenant well that just means there's no condition but you must accept it well you're putting it on condition and we'll see even those who taught like the baptists and things like that you know once saved always saved they did admit you had to be saved so if it's unconditional what you could be saved for are you with me if it's unconditional what do you need saving why do you need an advocate whereas john was saying if we sin talk about christians we have an advocate why do we need one for if it's all grace are you winning are you following me i'm just trying to talk to us simply about salvation and unconditional covenant and thoughts of mankind because you'll see later when we come back to the message of denominationalism you're going to see where all of these will start lining up and to see what we've been taught is what's killing us you come to the baptist you've been taught once safe to always say you come through the pentecostal you you believe you can be saved today and backslide and save today and backslide and speak in tongues and shouting what all what's the rest of them but just think about it what was abraha what was paul and james are doing how can they be reconciled we're only taking the words of a prophet unless the scriptures can come together to show us what was going on right and that's wonderful i'm glad to do that but i love for god to speak to me you know i mean speaking to brother branham was wonderful well he spoke to him to speak to me amen i believe that too but i believe god still speaks what about you then what about an unconditional covenant and we're going to read the scriptures in a minute and you just watch it come down but mainly to think about it that abraham believed abraham got up and went he surely must have been a believer when he took his own boy out to kill him amen he looked like a pretty good believer didn't he look like abraham had a lot of works that james could talk about doesn't it if they're not contrary or contradictory to each other they had to be saying the same thing right you know the reason i believe that that it's written like that i believe it's written to keep us lined up because if you're only reading paul without our understanding it looks like it doesn't make no difference what we do we're saved anyway oh once they always say we're on our way to heaven grace the prophet says we make it disgrace right and we're not talking about all the garbage of the world of denominationalisms and places of free loves and stuff like that that they can claim they're saved by grace that don't make no difference and you think people don't believe it that away you get out there and talk a little bit you'll find out they believe because they belong to that church and that doctrine that they're saved how much is that still left in you and me are we like the brother not throwing off on him he's dead and going on but we have pounded his arms and say instead of hearing those caves and fast and pray for days and days and weeks but he said they ain't an ounce of tradition in this old body but when they spoke to him about water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ he denied it we're not talking about people going out and just living garbage cans and saying it's all right we're talking about people that are trying to do right well what about it so when paul was looking at abraham was he totally justifying him just by what he believed or was paul knowing that abraham's believing was a type of the born-again believer that believed then is it okay do you just believe anything see then when james comes along and says show me your faith without your words i'll show you my faith by my words was he believing in works your armenians take that side right your calvinists take the side of well it's just faith no matter what you do it's just faith and your armenians come along and say well now wait a minute there's got to be works well what about both of them having the truth but you got to bring them together in the middle of the road to have the truth what about that you see there's not a church in the world a prophet said it didn't start out right right that's the way he says they started out right what about you and i which one is it we realize that the kingdom of god is not what we eat or drink or wearing of a pearl quoting from the mark of the beast we realize that god we realize that god that we don't stop this and stop wearing this and this to make us different but when the spirit of christ comes in it does that itself it's not what we do but what he does now this is the man that's explaining that paul and james is saying the same thing look at the images of christ where he says we don't believe that packing an image makes you a christian but yet he had one in his car over the river mirror he had a cross right did he say that he said something goes wrong you just look at that cross but he says that don't make you a christian i believe that being an image of christ makes us a christian it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are then therefore if he is our image and we are his likeness and members of his body we should be the image like him then our lives should reflect the image of christ not in our joining a church or in packing crucifix or emotions we should be in the living presence a living god that's reflecting throughout our life not what we do or don't do right it's whether or not we believe that he died for us you see believing that god came and lived is one thing believing that mom and dad is saved and all he does that's another thing but that's still part of it but that don't save you it's whether or not you can believe whether or not you can believe that god died in your place unconditional covenant and he made another covenant he talks about one with abraham that's on god's provided place of worship number six if you're gonna pull it up there but he made another covenant and that was with abraham the covenant was not on condition but was unconditionally god gave the covenant to abraham no strains tied to it at all unconditional not i will i've already done it that's the law that christians must live by it's not what we do not what we do ourselves but what he's done for us christ has already been sacrificed not he will he has been it's a finished product he lived died rose again ascended to heaven has come back in the form of the holy ghost and it's a finished work with god christ knowing no sin became my sin thou might stand in his place he took my place i was in him at calvary when he died you know i must die there i must die with him to live because the law of sin and death is in this body you have to die to be reconciled to him the law of sin and death is in this body but this body brother dale is no he's useless i mean that's where we can quickly see we're good quoters all right let me say it again we're good coders there's a difference in the coder and the quota and i can pull a quote up to show you that all right he said they didn't code it they quote they didn't quote it they coded it that's what the devil said to jesus and i'll give it to you well he quoted him no he coded the word a lot of difference in it too but you see do we believe we can just we don't have to worry about nothing we're saved do we believe that romans 14 and 10 says for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god do we believe that 11th verse so then every one of us shall give an account of himself to god now we're under unconditional covenant what are we going to give an account for so you just annihilated that scripture by your thought you see that's what we've done that's what i want to get to an organized religion denominationalism brother random even said moses when he smoked that rock the second time he said he set up a denomination you see romans 8 and 13 for if we live after the flesh or if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live right romans two and six it will render to every man according to his deeds romans 3 and 20 therefore by the deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of god this is what we like without the law it's manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets amen agree with every bit of it but once even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of the god being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ whom god has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are priced through the forbearance of god to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of them which believe in jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law that's paul right is he the god of the jews only or is it not the god of gentiles also yes of the gentiles also see it as one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith now i wonder why that would happen that way one of the jews get it that they're justified by faith but to us gentiles have to go through faith right now is god different to the jew and the gentile he just said no he wouldn't what's he saying he's saying that gentiles is the one that's going to mess it all up and done a good job down through seven church ages do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for if abraham were justified by works he hath were of the glory but not before god that's exactly right that's exactly right because that's what james is saying james is saying the same thing once for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness we look down through there and we think well paul is taking it one way therefore we've concluded a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law amen see can you say amen really mean it that there's nothing we can do it's what he's done and even after being born again it's still not what we do it's what he's come inside to live amen can we believe it that way therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law well it don't matter then what i do that's not what he said he goes on later and he said shall we sin that grace may about he said god forbid if i do that i make myself subject to that i become that part look what james says yeah amen they say thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i'll show thee my faith by my works can you say amen to that look on where he put in there in the middle of that i i you know i've never tried to make myself in a place with none of these fellers in the writing but it it really gets to you sometimes what goes in the middle every once in a while now i believe it's that there's one god that'll do us well the devils also believing trump and he goes back to his thought but you know that's his thought there i mean we say we believe we believe god so does the devil but we'll i know oh man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works come on now if that's not contradictory to what i just read over here that paul said it was justified without the deeds of the law and here james says was not our father abraham justified by works when it offered isaac his son upon the altar seeth how faith wrought with his works now watch him faith came together and his works displayed the faith that he had is that what he's saying and by works was faith made complete perfect perfectly complete finished and the scripture was fulfilled now what was a paul said over here for what saith the scripture you remember a few weeks ago when i was trying to preach how did it it must be the same way all the way through the bible and everything must be the same or we're missing it so now paul you just said for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness james says and the scripture was full filled didn't we read over there what paul was saying that we we established these things we put it in effect and make it work so look at james and the scripture was fulfilled how because abraham went out and done what god said do right then everybody around him says well especially the three guys or two or three that went with him for a little piece you know they left him there and abraham comes back and he finally tells sarah what he went up there to do i don't believe he told her for them and he said i took isaac up there he said i was going to kill him because god told me to and god inspired me to here's isaac isaac said i was kind of worried for a little while yeah because he asked daddy about it said i said daddy said we got the wood we got the fire we got the knife but where's the sacrifice now oh zach back there he's dale yeah he's pretty good sizable little fella i kind of believe it'd be hard for me to get him up on the altar if he knew i was going to kill him now little zach black he's got a black belt in karate he may be little but i don't believe bob could get him on that altar right i'm just being honest right but you know about the time they got up there somewhere in that point isaac begin to think i guess he said i think i found out who they're going to be to sacrifice and he never fought his father he just laid down well we surely ought to talk about isaac's faith in it for a little while because isaac's faith was beginning to believe what was going to take place that was his revelation that was his faith paul was speaking of but he just laid down that's what james was talking about because faith without works is dead you tell me you're a christian i expect to see you act like one right but then the odd the way paul paul says it and then peter james and the scripture was fulfilled which saith that's what abraham was that's what paul was saying the scripture said it james said it was fulfilled so they were talking about the same thing and abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and look paul never said this about him james said after all the conclusion of seeing all the life of abraham and his calling and his unconditional covenant and his believing and serving god and doing what god told him to do he said my conclusion is he's a friend of god wouldn't it be nice if somebody said that about you and me that we're a friend of god james was putting that i believe on the fact that abraham believed but yet he done something about his believing what are you not going to do what is an unconditional covenant well it just don't make no difference well you're not even in the covenant because you got to take james and put it there to see i know i got into trouble during romans 8 1. and i used that word i'll have to think of it for interpolated i got into trouble a lot of ministers about using the word interpolated it's uh schofield uses it in romans 8 where it says there is therefore now no condemnation of them that are in christ jesus now if he just stop right there look what a situation he'd leave and show you that paul wasn't just all faith see he said there is therefore now no condemnation of them that are in christ jesus and he realized that he was leaving a loophole that mankind would use so it says to those that walk not after the flesh you know but after the spirit that's called interpolating giving your thought and then making sure that your thought is not misunderstood you illustrate it you explain it you you talk about it and you're putting your thought down into words right now paul looks at abraham as his faith james looks at him as his works and both of them's got to be saying the same thing no faith paul said without works is dead or jane wanted to we claim to be christians the world has a right to look at us and to see whether we are or not how we dress how we act how we do but yet it don't matter what i do or don't do i'm saved by faith no you're saved by grace through faith amen that's what james and paul was talking about he said what's your point okay it's like i said two or three times and i said it back a long time ago i believe a lot of people in this message will have to die and go by the grave i may be one of them no problem i'm not de-christianizing anybody never i have never thrown off on any of you with a marital situation whatsoever i believe a lot of people are going to go by the grave because they can't believe god they can't believe god has forgiven them oh yeah they can believe the forgiving part but they can't bring that part into justification i i believe i'm forgiven but i still have problems is that the way a lot of people do about the new birth well i believe i'm born again but i just don't know don't know where i'm gonna make it to heaven or not i hope i do and saying you're born again but you see church salvation is not based upon what you do or don't do it's based upon whether or not i can believe that god took my place now how many times have you ever heard me try to explain about a heather and with a totem pole that heather and believes that his imaginary god enters that totem pole and he's got somebody to explain to him about the heathen heather and idea you know good preachers but they believe that whatever that imaginary god speaks to them they go and do they'll feed their babies to an alligator or whatever you know why because they believe their god is telling them you know i thank god that brother random made this statement he said god may not out may not ask for you to offer your child as he spoke to abraham i'm glad of that aren't you but he may have other things to ask us he simply asked us to live before the world to let the world see jesus christ you know what we're doing is arguing over grace or faith or works or law fussing about it instead of believing it accepting it if you don't believe god will forgive your sin why do you pray come on what's the purpose of praying if you don't believe god's not going to hear you it's all based on whether or not we believe it in it now brother dale after all the conclusion of what you've brought tonight bringing it together what you've come down to seemingly bring is a conclusion of the matter you seem to believe that we've got to do something to be saved i do i believe we've got to accept it all right so i believe we got something to do we got to accept it that doesn't change where it's unconditional yeah but if it's unconditional then it don't matter whether i ask for it accept it or whatever he's going to give it to me now you show me i've been one hour and some one hour a little over showing you that james and paul is not contrary showing you that abraham believed god he had something to do in it because god knew he'd believe him did he give him an unconditional covenant just is he going to save every jew come on he told paul i told abram you and your seat after you is he going to save everybody no he's going to save those who believe that's simple well like i do believe that's all you can do but then god sees our believing and comes on the scene and accepts our believing there's your salvation amen you want to call that works i don't call it works i just call it being plain and just honest god starts dealing in your heart children you say lord help me help me speak to me i'm sorry because that's the first thing in the presence of god so you tell me abraham didn't repent i'm honest maybe not in the way we call lord forgive me god forget no but he certainly wanted to walk right from then on and he kept on making the sacrifice and you make a sacrifice because you realize there's something wrong right quick as the kids in the garden found out they were wrong what did they do you know when donald mccain and they will vote what to do they made it offering your offering means repentance you take the animal up i'm repenting lord pack the animal in my place i just got to thinking about that i thought people will say but abraham didn't repent he sure done a lot of things he done so much until james would speak of the works that he done and how did he prove what he was by what he done do you see what james is doing james is not contrary to paul you know if paul has been sitting there my cousin he's against me he knows what i've been told it was all faith he said he's he's speaking against me if paul has been sitting there listening to james he's been screaming holiday man right jane said listening to paul would have been screaming and hollering amen that's why i got two in here if you need them but brother runner said it was not contradictory he said they were both saying the same thing one was expressing what god was seeing the other one was expressing what mankind sees all right then if you put them both together you go out and talk about your faith your stumbling block to go out and live like the devil and talk about your faith that ain't nothing but a stumbling block of the devil i don't care how much faith you got i don't care how much great revelation you've got people are watching your life to see whether or not you believe what you're talking about see what is an unconditional covenant then brother dale almighty god came down and paid the price for me made it to work he could cleanse me out and come and live inside of me to make sure that the works would be of him that's right the works of mankind is worth nothing they're filthy rights the bible says when god comes down into you and then you just walk out through there just being what you are just be what you are wherever you're at sure we're all human we make mistakes we do wrong that's why we have to have an advocate right why do you need an advocate if you don't do wrong and then the bible said for the sins the prophet said to christian sins he said yes said brother brown are you saying he said every day but then he'll turn around and tell you over and over that a christian cannot sin but you know what he's exactly right a real true christian inwardly cannot sin but we can sin outwardly see that's why church i don't believe the new birth does away with our marital problems i've never believed that because you got trouble dealing with paul i mean with with luther and all of those you're going to have to totally drive them to hell because we have to admit we have done a lot wrong but if we can see that he paid the price then we can walk out free we can step outside the belt draw the bars of those jails and come out of there free and god says come my son i hope you understand i guess the devil fought me more today than any time because i just wanted to talk to you to make sure you and i understand we're saved by grace through faith and if we don't live that christian life from the inward man then we're nothing but a stumbling block in front of our neighbors and the people around us sure we're human sure we do wrong sure we have a little temperance because if you don't need no temperance i mean if you don't have a temper what do you need temperance in the statue of perfect land for and if you've got all knowledge why do you need knowledge you see the scriptures tells us where we stand he that the son is set free is free indeed but we got to believe that and say thank you lord that's mine come on brothers see that's mine james and paul is saying the same thing and what they're saying is what the whole entire bible is said we must accept jesus christ as our savior but then we want him to come in and live paul said it's not i that liveth but christ that liveth in me but i thought it was grace i thought it was an unconditional let me explain that just a second the prophet said when i get ready to go overseas you remember that he said i don't grab my wife so now you you you you run around with me while i'm gone you're divorced you know here she don't grab me and say you better not be fooling around he said we get down and pray and i commit them to the lord and they commit me to the lord and he said even though i believe that if i went out and done something wrong and came home and told my wife he said i believe she'd forgive me he said but how dare me to think about even that how could he even think about it her at home standing before the public and putting up all the things she had to do you know he said here i am he said i'm gone out preaching sometimes three or four months he'd be gone he said come in home next morning at five o'clock i got my hat and got in my hunting clothes and gone to the woods he said how many women to put up with that then how could we sin when we know see this is the way i think how could i go out and sin willfully doing it when i know that he's not going to send me to hell see that's not works that's not legalism that's a bond of love it's in my heart for my master then brother dale do you do wrong yes every day do you have to repent every night that's my last thing lord forgive my sins and sometimes you know you can't remember maybe what you've done but just remember when you ask god says sins he knows what them sins were see then what is it church it's amazing grace well we got ready 369 let's stand the mighty god is jesus the prince of peace is the everlasting father you know him like that as a savior to live inside of you if not come and let's talk to him let's talk to him about it the mighty god is jesus see with a dog like that who wouldn't want to serve me they won't destroy us because we do wrong but we're just destroyed because we don't do anything about it all the little examples because i'm just thinking today just the lord don't let us get caught with these things come on to sing lord shorten the days upon the earth that we have that's prayer that's my prayer yeah but i want my family in don't worry about it if they're predestinated they're going to be there they're predestinated they're going to be there how many days you got here you got nothing to do with it you can take care of things in a long long ways off in a whole lot of hurry he has no distance to him or anything why can't we believe him why wouldn't we believe him after all of what he's done for us why wouldn't we want to serve pull this off you already heard them jamaican one is singing that well they can roll it you see they can't see you and i are the final morphe of god upon the earth they can't follow it that away to the gentile dispensation where they're finally morphing the final manifestation of god you think that ain't grace we're gonna get into it law is our thoughts grace is what he says right is what he says he said it and i believe it he said i'm perfect why can't i say i'm perfect anybody have a need good to see freda back with us glad you able to make it down with the family and be okay just pray the lord with blessing god eats everyone lord jesus you've heard this

brother bill to seeing many things anybody heard anything from him i haven't heard nothing other than the likes that he was you know amending him and i get i get irritated if we believe it okay father we thank you we love you lord we pray that what we said tonight was worthy father because you know the burden that's been on our heart and just help us lord to see that it's not what we do or don't do you saved us and you looked down in there and you saw something that you liked some way i don't know no other way of saying it lord something about abraham was different you chose him it wasn't his repentance and his doings but it was because he was willing to repent and to do we pray that you would just bless us and guide each and every one of us keep us lord in your love and your grace let your guidance be with each one forgive our sins take care of everybody on the highway let your love be there in jesus name amen you just missed thank you you
