[1:53] I speak to your shame it is so that
[1:57] there is not a wise man among you no not
[2:00] one that shall be able to judge between
[2:03] his brothers
[2:11] now therefore
[2:13] there is utterly a fault among you
[2:17] because ye go to the law with one
[2:20] another why do ye not rather take wrong
[2:24] why do ye not rather suffer yourself to
[2:27] be defrauded
[2:32] thank you
[2:34] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[2:37] not inherit the kingdom of God be not
[2:40] deceived neither fornicators nor
[2:42] idolaters or not adultery not feminists
[2:46] not abuses of themselves with mankind
[2:58] and such were some of you but ye are
[3:02] washed but ye are Sanctified but ye are
[3:05] justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:08] by the spirit of our God

[3:25] but God shall destroy them
[3:28] and
[3:30] God shall destroy both it and them now

[3:36] but for the Lord and the Lord for the
[3:39] body

[3:47] no ye not that your bodies are the
[3:51] members of Christ shall I then
[3:55] take the members of Christ and make them
[3:57] the members of a harlot God forbid
[4:10] but he that is drawing unto the Lord is
[4:13] one spirit
[4:26] what know ye not that your body is the
[4:29] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[4:31] which ye have of God and ye are not your
[4:36] own

[4:41] glorify God in your body and in your
[4:45] spirit which ye are Gods amen God bless

[10:29] us this day as we try to talk about you
[10:32] Lord and speak about the things that
[10:34] you've laid upon our heart to cover
[10:37] and in doing it may you come and Quicken
[10:39] that word unto us that we may become the

[11:08] believe that you will come Among Us and
[11:10] heal the sick deliver each one remember
[11:13] especially Anna there with that bleeding
[11:15] and we pray that it was with the the
[11:18] time there in the Bible when
[11:21] a lady had been to many doctors and done
[11:23] everything she could do and all but yet
[11:26] once into your presence then the blood
[11:29] issue stopped so we condemned that issue
[11:33] that's causing the problems now in the
[11:36] name of Jesus Christ we love you and we
[11:39] thank you just have your way now as we
[11:40] read your word you come and speak to our
[11:42] hearts in Jesus name amen Romans 8
[11:48] in Ephesians 1.
[11:52] Romans 8 in Ephesians 1.
[11:56] Lord willing maybe this afternoon we'll
[11:57] try to get a little more back on to
[12:00] our predestination all right I've I've
[12:03] not tried to get away from it
[12:05] I believe that this is what we needed to
[12:09] understand
[12:10] you know and trying to get a foundation
[12:13] to make sure we do understand
[12:17] what the Lord is wanting in this day
[12:19] okay Romans 8 28 and we know that all
[12:22] things work together for good to them
[12:23] that love God to them who are thee
[12:25] called according to his purpose for whom
[12:28] he did for no
[12:29] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[12:32] to the image of his son that he might be
[12:34] the firstborn among many brethren
[12:37] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[12:40] he also called and whom he called let me
[12:42] also justified in whom he justified them
[12:45] he also glorified
[12:46] what shall we then say to these things
[12:50] if God be for us who can be against us
[12:53] okay let's go over to Ephesians
[12:56] in
[12:58] try to read
[13:01] a couple of scriptures Ephesians 1
[13:06] in beginning with verse 3.
[13:10] that should be the God and father of our
[13:12] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[13:14] with all spiritual blessings were in
[13:16] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in
[13:19] Christ according as he hath chosen Us in
[13:22] him before the foundation of the world
[13:24] that we should be holding Without Blame
[13:27] before him in love
[13:29] having predestinated us unto the
[13:32] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[13:35] himself according to the good pleasure
[13:37] of his will
[13:39] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[13:41] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[13:44] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[13:47] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[13:49] sins
[13:50] according to the riches of his grace you
[13:54] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[13:56] to the reading of the word
[14:00] now we
[14:01] covered
[14:05] this past Wednesday
[14:09] of talking about
[14:12] what is a soul
[14:13] so I was asked back under to speak on
[14:16] this so it came out to be a good time
[14:18] okay the announcements these things are
[14:20] up here on the platform
[14:23] um this if I knew how to run this thing
[14:25] I'd buy a whole lot of them
[14:27] but uh maybe one of these days y'all are
[14:30] getting me up on a yeah I get a good I
[14:33] call them iPod iPod and then all kind of
[14:35] farts and parts and pads and and they
[14:38] get me fixed up you know but there is a
[14:40] good one and it's only like 20 29 that
[14:44] you can put the whole message into your
[14:45] phone
[14:46] and that would be good you know take it
[14:49] with you you can have the whole message
[14:51] and they'll order it they'll send it to
[14:52] you spoken word and you can put it into
[14:55] your phone you got it right there will
[14:56] you I might get encouraged to get one
[15:00] I'm still having troubles with the
[15:03] the
[15:04] regular phone so we don't worry about it
[15:07] all right
[15:09] but now
[15:10] as I saying we were talking about this
[15:12] past
[15:13] Wednesday especially
[15:16] of
[15:18] what is a soul
[15:22] you know I don't think we
[15:25] understand
[15:28] you know
[15:29] what we're really dealing with
[15:33] in in the point of trying to talk about
[15:36] these things
[15:39] and uh you know
[15:41] there's been so much talk
[15:44] contrary to the truth until you know
[15:48] it's hard to try to get people to listen
[15:52] to the word
[15:54] uh you know I I was listening we was to
[15:58] or maybe that I don't want to deer stand
[16:00] the other day one listening to brother
[16:01] Branham because that's what I do I just
[16:03] sit there and
[16:04] run through and like last night I think
[16:06] we listened to three two or three tapes
[16:08] we do that a lot we just sat there and
[16:10] listen and you know go right through but
[16:13] Rhoda Branham was talking about if we
[16:15] don't believe all of the truth
[16:18] no you know what he said
[16:21] he said you've got the wrong interpreter
[16:27] I mean that's as blunt as can be he said
[16:30] if we don't believe all the truth
[16:32] and we take away a little bit or
[16:34] whatever you know when we divide he said
[16:37] we don't have
[16:39] the correct interpreter
[16:42] because that's the holy spirit's
[16:44] supposed to be the only interpreter of
[16:45] the word right
[16:46] all right
[16:48] but see this has been argued with of
[16:51] mankind about to religious Realms going
[16:54] down through organizations and things
[16:57] and you know
[17:00] of what is really the soul of man
[17:04] and that's what I tried my best to
[17:06] express what I could I have for 40
[17:09] something years here to preach to you
[17:12] and uh to try to get you to see I
[17:16] believe the soul is the real you all
[17:19] right and see we we want to just make it
[17:22] something that's just
[17:25] not
[17:26] uh real
[17:29] and then we want to go with the soul is
[17:32] just the nature of the spirit well
[17:34] that's not a quote
[17:36] and challenge you to find it for me the
[17:39] prophet says the soul is the nature of
[17:41] the spirit when the people put that just
[17:43] the nature of the spirit it was just
[17:45] putting it in a realm of floating
[17:47] Spirits or this kind of spirits or
[17:49] nothing real
[17:51] it's just the nature of something so you
[17:54] got a dog it's the nature of a dog
[17:55] you've got a cat it's the nature of a
[17:57] cat you got a human that's a nature of
[17:59] Mom and Daddy it don't have to be
[18:03] right
[18:05] it don't have to be
[18:07] then that's where the people get it in
[18:09] there you know they'll just say well
[18:11] brother Dale the the prophet said the
[18:13] soul is the nature of the spirit well
[18:14] okay
[18:17] but is that just tacking something onto
[18:19] something
[18:21] you know a nature or something is what
[18:24] you inherit right
[18:26] right a dog a bird dog through its
[18:29] natural inheritance through its parents
[18:31] it comes out to be a bird dog and it
[18:34] will point
[18:35] you don't have to be trying to point it
[18:38] will automatically point because that's
[18:40] this nature of its doing you know and
[18:43] things well then if that be true of just
[18:46] an animal that has no soul what about a
[18:48] human being
[18:49] but that's what I was trying to get
[18:51] across to us about the soul and bringing
[18:54] the scriptures and involving all of it
[18:56] that it says the soul that sent us shall
[18:58] die doesn't say the spirit that's right
[19:00] it doesn't say the body I want scripture
[19:03] for it yeah but I believe so and so I
[19:05] don't care what you believe
[19:07] I'm sorry that's just past that you know
[19:11] I think what we need to do here is pass
[19:14] out some sugar tits around in this place
[19:16] because we've had more hurt feelings
[19:18] around here in the past three or four
[19:20] months than we've ever had as long as
[19:22] I've been pastor
[19:24] and I thank all this going backside and
[19:26] get a I'll get some pacifiers and just
[19:28] give everybody one and you know you can
[19:31] get over your hurt feelings and if I
[19:33] hurt your feelings I'm sorry but check
[19:35] it out see where the truth or not you
[19:37] hurt my feelings I always try to check
[19:39] it to see whether it's right or not
[19:41] see then that way we just put our
[19:44] feelings where
[19:46] supposed to be sitting on them
[19:49] okay
[19:50] you remember now we we're getting in a
[19:52] day where it's getting pretty bad when
[19:53] they when I can jump on to
[19:56] a Duck Dynasty guys bro what are they
[19:59] saying who do you think they're going to
[20:01] get after next you know and do all of
[20:04] that but you know
[20:06] so right now the world's divided over
[20:08] whether or not he would have said that
[20:09] or understood it but that's all right
[20:11] that's none of my business I don't I
[20:13] didn't know that until the other day we
[20:14] had I was wondering what are they doing
[20:16] you know because I don't have a TV and
[20:18] no food with it
[20:19] but now listen
[20:23] if the soul is the thing that senteth
[20:27] or the part or whatever we are
[20:29] then it would have to be more real than
[20:32] the body
[20:33] and it would have to be more real than
[20:35] the spirit realm of mankind
[20:37] because animals have a spirit Realm
[20:40] of their being you know but they don't
[20:43] have a soul all right now then in seeing
[20:47] it then we ought to realize the reality
[20:49] of the soul that it was no way the Old
[20:52] Testament people could have the soul of
[20:55] God to come to them because there was no
[20:57] way made for it to come so it would be
[21:00] an anointing from the spirit to come and
[21:03] it could be on Balaam it could be on
[21:05] Moses and be the same anointing and come
[21:08] over in the New Testament and you can
[21:09] still have the anointed ones right that
[21:13] we talk about that it's a genuine Holy
[21:15] Spirit anointing people's spirit for
[21:18] them to do the things they're doing you
[21:19] know and be who they are but still down
[21:23] inside of there
[21:24] is the real you
[21:27] I've tried my best to get people to see
[21:29] that since the two Soul doctrines
[21:31] started back in the probably in the 60s
[21:33] and in the part of my Ministry that I've
[21:36] tried to have I've tried my best to not
[21:39] attack people but yet to try to explain
[21:42] the truth because see it must need to be
[21:45] heresies among you why because it'll
[21:47] make you dig
[21:49] and it'll prove who's who that's right
[21:51] by the heresies that are among you so
[21:54] then they there had to be heresies the
[21:56] brains make us think about
[21:58] amen you know people wouldn't thinking
[22:00] about the soul we're in any organization
[22:03] denominationalisms
[22:05] Etc was anybody talking about the soul
[22:08] of man
[22:09] as I told you they even had people back
[22:11] there that I ran into that said you
[22:14] didn't even have a soul until the law
[22:15] came into being
[22:18] well there's a lot of things that people
[22:19] believe about this that or the other but
[22:22] what does that matter in in the whole
[22:24] realm it's you and I
[22:27] mean and it's like I'm saying you your
[22:29] your new birth's not in your body
[22:31] your new birth's not in your spirit
[22:33] because the Bible says that
[22:35] and I'll give you a new heart and a new
[22:38] spirit
[22:39] but the prophet of God said that's not
[22:41] the Holy Spirit
[22:43] he said then I put my spirit in you
[22:45] didn't say I'll give you another new
[22:47] spirit he said I put my spirit in you
[22:51] my being my part that I am to be
[22:55] dwelling in you anointed ones that's not
[22:58] in you
[22:59] right right
[23:00] come on Lord I know the difference
[23:02] anointed ones and true genuine because
[23:04] anointing ones that's not in you it's on
[23:06] you
[23:07] what
[23:09] let's see then we just say well so
[23:11] overnights are so business would you see
[23:13] and you're taking the old the the older
[23:15] years of the prophet's message and try
[23:18] to make doctrines out of it
[23:20] when I've tried my best to show you for
[23:23] 40-something years that that Prophet
[23:25] didn't have to change what he taught
[23:27] because he always taught five senses for
[23:30] the body see taste feel smelled here he
[23:32] always taught five senses for the second
[23:34] realm
[23:36] which was reason memory conscious
[23:38] affections love Etc whatever
[23:40] imaginations
[23:41] he always taught one sense for the soul
[23:45] either Faith or doubt all right it's not
[23:49] both of them faith and doubt
[23:52] you know now we're going to get to it
[23:54] when we get down maybe this afternoon
[23:56] God won't dwell in an unclean vessel
[23:59] dude don't you put no soul of God in you
[24:02] and the soul of the devil
[24:03] now you're getting into a garbage can
[24:06] all right I'm sorry but I think it's
[24:09] time to be blunt I have been for 40
[24:12] something years if you've listened to me
[24:14] so there's no need of changing now you
[24:17] know and try to Sweet soft the thing you
[24:20] know and uh soap it there what you call
[24:22] that word
[24:24] but now listen
[24:26] see then the Soul is the nature of the
[24:29] spirit
[24:30] one because that Spirit displays what
[24:34] your soul is
[24:35] right
[24:38] the nature of my
[24:40] actions in my body
[24:43] the actions by my spirit realm displaced
[24:46] what's inside of me
[24:49] right
[24:50] I mean if like the prophet said if I was
[24:54] John Dillinger you would expect me to
[24:56] carry a couple of pistols this morning
[24:58] you know because that would be what
[25:00] would be inside of me
[25:02] all right but that's not what's in there
[25:07] see then the born-again Christian is not
[25:09] born again in body
[25:10] you're not born again in your spirit
[25:12] amen you're born again in the center
[25:14] realm the soul
[25:16] but brother Dale I got worse come on
[25:19] read to quit read
[25:21] what's what Rim he's talking about draw
[25:24] you three circles
[25:26] and then stay with what he's talking
[25:28] about each circle and what the being of
[25:31] it is
[25:32] but see that ain't going to change
[25:33] nobody unless somebody's searching for
[25:36] truth
[25:37] you wouldn't be here today if it hadn't
[25:39] been somebody trying to search for truth
[25:41] right
[25:42] that's right amen because that way we're
[25:44] searching
[25:45] all right we don't claim to have all the
[25:47] truth but we claim to believe what we
[25:49] believe
[25:50] all right now then the rest of it will
[25:53] take care of itself as we go along
[25:55] but see the soul is the real you it's
[25:58] truly what you are
[26:01] it will live on after death
[26:05] amen the body doesn't live on
[26:08] the spirit doesn't live on
[26:12] it's the soul
[26:14] the real you
[26:16] that's what you are
[26:19] you are a soul a being Joel means person
[26:23] being whatever
[26:25] all right and I'll get back to this in a
[26:27] while see then if we can believe that
[26:30] Jesus's soul
[26:33] you know
[26:35] went to hell
[26:37] that it was his Spirit his soul his
[26:39] person of his being his theophany then
[26:42] why can't we believe what we are
[26:45] mainly because you ain't never heard it
[26:48] that's the reason people don't believe
[26:50] it they've got their preconceived ideas
[26:52] and thoughts and they're not going to
[26:54] change it
[26:54] I don't expect people to change their
[26:56] thoughts I don't expect you to accept
[26:58] what I say I expect you to go look up
[27:00] what I say
[27:02] that's why I read what the prophet said
[27:05] I don't even just give you well quote
[27:07] Prophet said so and so well you don't
[27:10] know whether that's right or not unless
[27:11] you write it down real quick
[27:15] but see I just put it up here and let
[27:17] you read it
[27:18] at least you can't argue with that point
[27:21] all right but listen
[27:24] the soul the prophet said it's what you
[27:27] are
[27:29] amen
[27:31] it's more real than this
[27:37] come on
[27:41] it was before this
[27:46] you remember Ezekiel 18 4 All Souls are
[27:49] mine Satan can't give you a soul
[27:53] come on I don't blow all those doctrines
[27:55] out of the world but it won't
[27:57] Satan can't give you a soul and make him
[27:59] a creator
[28:03] All Souls God said her mind
[28:07] the soul of the Father the soul of the
[28:10] son he said
[28:11] All Souls are mine
[28:13] all right now then if we are that
[28:20] if we are a being a soul
[28:23] then we were created in the image of God
[28:28] I'll get to that later on in the message
[28:30] but I'm just laying down a few thoughts
[28:36] see the soul is what governs you right
[28:39] not your body right it's not your spirit
[28:41] that governs you
[28:43] now governs governs what does governance
[28:47] mean rules
[28:49] dominates right right
[28:51] so if I'm John Dillinger you'd expect me
[28:54] to be a crook
[28:56] but by saying I'm a Christian
[28:59] I'm not supposed to have that form of
[29:01] nature
[29:03] right see then if I'm lying cheating
[29:06] stealing running around with women
[29:07] commit adulter all kind of things
[29:10] and you know for certain there's
[29:12] something wrong on the Edward part of me
[29:15] brother Dale it's just my spirit I was
[29:18] just born this way that's what I told my
[29:20] brother
[29:20] said God made me this way and he can't
[29:22] judge me for being wrong I said he
[29:24] didn't make you wrong he made you right
[29:27] you went wrong
[29:29] with everybody he can judge you for
[29:31] being wrong he didn't make you go wrong
[29:34] we've been through that right
[29:37] you know when I say things people just
[29:40] go hey where I believe every soul was
[29:42] created perfect
[29:44] I did not say eternal
[29:48] the baby's born it's perfect
[29:51] I did not say eternal
[29:55] all right you show me where God can
[29:56] create anything imperfect
[29:59] can you show that to me I'll put a sign
[30:01] on my back and walk out of here right
[30:02] now and we'll just quit
[30:04] but you know you can't do it
[30:08] right see God doesn't create anything
[30:10] imperfect
[30:12] we
[30:14] perverted we deform it
[30:18] a tree bending over what something
[30:20] happened to cause a deformity
[30:24] all right
[30:25] when you and I are born as babies
[30:29] that's as perfect as you can be right
[30:33] right but by giving you a free morning
[30:35] agency a choice in us being born where
[30:38] we're at
[30:38] then you start out automatically being
[30:41] wrong
[30:42] because everything you hear to say the
[30:44] little baby is born in the hospital bed
[30:46] laying there you know and all the nurses
[30:48] and going around and said boy blankety
[30:50] blankety blankety blank look at this
[30:51] full moon all these babies blankety
[30:54] blank you know cussing like crazy
[30:58] he said well the baby can't hear
[31:01] have you ever asked a baby couldn't hear
[31:03] yeah
[31:04] whose authority are you going on
[31:08] right
[31:10] if you don't believe it can hear
[31:13] walk in a room and speak to it
[31:18] right
[31:19] it may not be able to roll around do
[31:21] very much but it's going to try its best
[31:23] turn the Way You Are
[31:26] right
[31:28] see
[31:29] that's what gets me is all these people
[31:30] telling their theologies you know well a
[31:33] baby can't do this the baby can't
[31:35] whoever asked the baby
[31:38] huh
[31:40] well we determine that because well you
[31:42] were the baby
[31:45] because the baby's got more sense than
[31:46] you have
[31:48] all right that's just plain but it's
[31:50] true
[31:51] but it's perfect
[31:55] not Eternal perfect he become a living
[31:57] soul
[32:00] God breathed into his nostrils he become
[32:02] a living soul
[32:05] all right
[32:07] then
[32:09] what is that
[32:10] what govern you is what you are
[32:13] you are what you are remember
[32:17] progress 66 or uncertain Sam I didn't
[32:19] put these up now these are quotes the
[32:21] soul is what governs you you are what
[32:24] you are by your soul
[32:29] your soul is real
[32:32] it's not just a spirit part floating
[32:34] around
[32:35] it's more real than your body
[32:40] right
[32:44] it was in being before your body was
[32:46] dropped from Mama right right
[32:49] it's more real
[32:50] but see we want something tangible well
[32:53] brother Dale I just never have seen a
[32:55] soul
[32:59] you haven't
[33:03] you've never seen a soul
[33:09] how about waking up
[33:11] I know it's well on over and it'll
[33:13] probably be next week week after next
[33:14] and we're next year but
[33:19] Moses desired to see God
[33:23] right
[33:27] am I right
[33:28] he talked to him face to face he'd talk
[33:30] to him lip to ear he'd been in his
[33:33] presence he had seen all kinds of things
[33:34] but one day he desired to see God
[33:37] you know what God said let's go stand
[33:38] over on that Cliff to the Rock and I'll
[33:40] pass by and you can see my back part
[33:42] because you can't see my face right now
[33:47] and he saw the back part
[33:49] of a man
[33:52] amen amen but brother Dale you just you
[33:55] just make God a man well what are you
[33:57] going to make him
[34:01] yeah but but he's just a spirit
[34:07] you've been taught that all your life
[34:08] why don't you wake up read for yourself
[34:10] get your Baptist glasses Methodist
[34:12] Presbyterian Pentecostal and Brandon
[34:14] Myers you know what I mean by that not
[34:16] brought around his message
[34:19] the idiots in this message the way they
[34:21] try to read to you
[34:23] what
[34:24] you get them glasses
[34:29] and then believe it right
[34:34] is God real amen amen well he's just a
[34:38] spirit yes
[34:41] and here it comes along like this in the
[34:43] message you want to sympathize right
[34:45] I'm telling some brothers one time years
[34:47] ago about it and they said well well
[34:49] brother so-and-so said God was just like
[34:51] a spirit just floating around I said
[34:53] brother random said he was not like a
[34:55] spirit he was not like the wind he was a
[34:57] being well that's his way of seeing it
[35:00] yeah
[35:01] I'll get what he sees
[35:03] I said another day I wish sometimes you
[35:05] could sit with me on a deer stand and
[35:07] listen to God my wife would talk about
[35:09] it the other day have you ever seen
[35:10] anybody that could talk like run around
[35:12] them I get so
[35:14] I mean I get so amazed at just listening
[35:16] to him talk
[35:19] a seventh grade education man
[35:22] and he's explaining Body Spirit and soul
[35:25] to the doctors
[35:29] and the doctor says
[35:31] man there's something crazy about you
[35:34] said you could dream a dream without
[35:36] going to sleep
[35:39] he said oh that's what you're talking
[35:41] about he said have you ever heard of
[35:43] visions
[35:44] said the prophets had visions
[35:52] do you realize that we I am anyway I'm
[35:55] gonna put it that way I'll get back up
[35:56] to myself and forget it
[35:58] I read the scripture sometimes and it
[36:01] doesn't sound right
[36:05] you don't ever do that
[36:07] you know it's not clear I don't
[36:09] understand it
[36:10] but then I click on the tape and the
[36:12] prophet's explaining that scripture and
[36:13] it makes it so simple there's no other
[36:15] way it could be said than that
[36:17] right you realize that the very words of
[36:19] the man now not every time he said the
[36:22] and and button this and that and the
[36:24] other you know
[36:25] according with human being but I've
[36:27] still got to listen to him as a human
[36:29] being
[36:31] right
[36:34] even if even if what he's got he ain't
[36:37] saying thus saith the Lord I still don't
[36:38] listen to him explain it
[36:41] man hadn't you
[36:43] well he ain't explained it my way oh
[36:48] that went wrong didn't it
[36:52] remember the word comes to the prophet
[36:57] it don't come to you
[36:59] except by way of the prophet
[37:02] we don't have a right to believe no we
[37:05] lost that right as Christians amen
[37:09] right
[37:10] right so the soul is what governs you
[37:12] it's what you are you are what you are
[37:15] by your soul
[37:16] you remember this one was on it you must
[37:18] be born again
[37:20] 61. what is a soul it's you you are a
[37:24] soul
[37:28] well it's the spirit that's floating
[37:30] around
[37:33] if you don't think there's more into you
[37:36] being real then uh
[37:40] you know
[37:42] if if you don't think there's something
[37:43] in you that's more real
[37:45] then
[37:48] what you are
[37:51] suppose I tap
[37:53] Michael on the head
[37:58] something's going to tell him to holler
[38:00] oh
[38:01] right
[38:03] so there's something in there that's
[38:05] more real than anything else
[38:08] but see that's what we don't think and
[38:10] we don't think God is real we think he's
[38:13] just some floating Spirit floating
[38:14] around
[38:18] it's been the hardest thing in my life
[38:19] to try to express what little sensible
[38:22] thing that I could see about how real
[38:24] God is
[38:28] he's got to be more real than all of
[38:30] this he created it
[38:34] yes but I just thought he was a spirit
[38:37] floating around this is fear he just
[38:40] comes down as a spirit and he does
[38:44] he's omniscient
[38:45] he's omnipresent
[38:48] he's all of those things but yet he's
[38:50] not real
[38:54] you see folks what we're doing is
[38:56] letting the devil interpret that's what
[38:58] we've done all of our lives
[39:00] we've let him interpret to us
[39:04] instead of
[39:07] taking what God Said
[39:13] but you see what they're doing today
[39:15] okay
[39:16] but listen
[39:19] when men fail
[39:22] what did the prophet explain like
[39:23] blasphemus I mean uh
[39:27] greatest battle ever fall
[39:30] he said that God chose the heart of man
[39:35] he said Satan chose his head
[39:37] right right now
[39:41] the head is the intelligence form of
[39:44] situation we think right but that's
[39:46] wrong because we don't think with our
[39:48] head
[39:51] right right
[39:51] oh that's just a bunch of massive bright
[39:54] I just a bunch of stuff to record that's
[39:56] a good tape recorder that's a good
[39:57] computer
[39:59] but you don't think with your head the
[40:01] Bible says as a man thank a word
[40:04] in his heart so is he
[40:07] heart of man is soul of man right
[40:10] not just spirit it's soul
[40:13] it's being is what you are so God chose
[40:16] the soul of man
[40:20] Satan chose the head
[40:22] now in the head is all the intelligence
[40:24] of the human being right
[40:29] but the soul is down inside of there not
[40:31] as just
[40:32] they're going to run around them
[40:34] explaining it and he said science says
[40:36] that the human heart has an inch square
[40:38] compartment no other animal has he said
[40:40] could it be the Bold of the Soul now
[40:42] ain't that something
[40:45] he's not explaining that the inch square
[40:47] compartment is where you're living at
[40:49] the real you right right he's telling
[40:51] you what science says that there is
[40:53] ability of human man to be something
[40:55] different than the animals
[41:00] your soul is you
[41:04] right right
[41:05] is what you are
[41:09] as I say in Wednesday night trying to
[41:11] explain it then
[41:13] see we say to our kids well we just let
[41:14] them grow up and be what they want to
[41:15] because that's the way they want to be
[41:17] let them be and we didn't do that with
[41:20] ours right
[41:21] right you can do what you want to with
[41:22] yours
[41:24] but we didn't do that with ours
[41:27] an old Papa
[41:30] you know old old grandpa
[41:33] go to your granddaddy
[41:35] little Abby was acting up one day and I
[41:37] told him I said you need to correct her
[41:41] and I said you need to get a little
[41:42] Hickory don't enter with your hand
[41:47] well they didn't go get the Hickory I
[41:49] got one outside and got one
[41:51] and I brought it in I said
[41:53] use that instead of your hand instead of
[41:57] hollering and screaming at them shaking
[41:59] them
[42:00] he never heard nobody get a brain damage
[42:02] from a little Hickory
[42:03] but you can make a brain damage or break
[42:05] somebody's neck or kill them by shaking
[42:07] them slapping them in the face I see one
[42:10] of you slapping in the face I'll try
[42:12] slapping you
[42:14] rather Dale you're not be that way I'm
[42:15] not that way
[42:17] I said old outside part of me
[42:24] you said well that's hard to fight it is
[42:27] but listen
[42:31] we say
[42:32] but brother Dale the soul is just the
[42:35] nature of the spirit it's not just the
[42:37] nature of the spirit
[42:40] he said well it's the nature of the
[42:41] spirit then we'll go that way
[42:46] but then a prophet comes along
[42:48] that's where we ended up
[42:51] talking about it
[42:55] talking about the real you
[42:59] see what you are
[43:01] huh
[43:04] and the prophet of God said on souls in
[43:07] prison
[43:08] 1963 11 10 the morning service
[43:12] what'd he say
[43:14] and I know where they pulled that one up
[43:16] or not no that's 44 you're on the you're
[43:19] on another quote
[43:20] you can run it backwards if you want to
[43:22] and we'll get to that one but what did
[43:24] he say
[43:27] he says the soul of man is not the body
[43:29] of man it's the soul and the soul is
[43:31] something that's the the nature of the
[43:33] spirit
[43:35] then when the nature of a man see
[43:38] yourself please just Nature's spirit
[43:40] then he's describing how and he said it
[43:43] wasn't that your body died
[43:46] it was that your spirit died it was the
[43:50] nature of your spirit diet see the
[43:52] nature which is the soul
[43:56] then what'd he say the nature of your
[44:00] soul is God
[44:04] if you're born again
[44:06] if it's not it's
[44:09] of the world well how can the nature be
[44:11] a nature that's where you're tied up at
[44:13] I don't have no problems
[44:17] the nature of my soul is being displayed
[44:20] this day
[44:22] now if I say something hateful that's
[44:25] the outside part of me
[44:28] because I do still believe that when you
[44:31] are born again you are still a human in
[44:33] the outward parts of you in the nature
[44:34] of your spirit and your body
[44:37] and controlled and motivated by this
[44:39] world
[44:40] but that inward part
[44:44] is God
[44:47] he said the nature of your soul is God
[44:49] if you're born again
[44:50] so it wasn't your soul now watch what
[44:53] I'm saying it wasn't your soul that died
[44:59] see that would be you'd have to replace
[45:01] it with something it's the nature of
[45:04] that
[45:07] your spirit displays to your body
[45:11] so it wasn't your soul dying
[45:14] you don't take out put in another one
[45:16] that's exchange that's a close doctrine
[45:19] of the two Souls
[45:22] call it Exchange
[45:24] all right
[45:26] but the nature of what I was
[45:30] came out
[45:31] by the new birth
[45:33] justification sanctification
[45:39] that takes out that old nature of my
[45:42] being but it don't take out my being
[45:48] it just takes the nature of it away
[45:51] that's simple to me now I know I'm
[45:53] accused of being so deep until people
[45:55] can't understand now I'm so simple they
[45:57] can't understand me
[46:01] because I don't talk with education and
[46:03] that's what I think about right around
[46:04] them I listen to that man he don't talk
[46:06] with education
[46:09] he talks from the Holy Spirit that's
[46:11] with inside of him
[46:13] let's see what was that scripture the
[46:14] other day he was talking about we're
[46:16] talking about unto your and your
[46:18] children and to them that are far off or
[46:20] whatever they're in the scripture you
[46:21] know he said unto you Jews and your
[46:24] children
[46:25] Jews and then went far off he says
[46:27] Gentile
[46:30] and as many as the Lord Our God shall
[46:32] call he said both you and Gentile
[46:34] I sat there and cried
[46:38] that's so cynical
[46:42] tell me mankind are there some
[46:44] theologian
[46:51] simply saying
[46:54] you your children
[46:56] and them that are far off and the men is
[46:58] the Lord Our God shall call
[47:01] and you just put it in simple
[47:02] terminology
[47:05] simple terminology is your soul is you
[47:07] you are what you are
[47:10] you're not born again in your body and
[47:12] Spirits you have to be born again in
[47:14] your soul and to be born again in your
[47:16] soul is what the nature of that Soul has
[47:19] to die amen
[47:23] which is of the world
[47:26] and then God comes and lives in US
[47:30] now you got the new birth
[47:32] Paul summed it up by saying this Christ
[47:34] in you the hope of glory life that amen
[47:39] Amen in the flesh
[47:43] he said I'm motivated on the inside of
[47:46] me
[47:47] by this faith that came to me this
[47:51] Revelation this person that came to me
[47:53] to birth me
[47:56] and he said you beat me you do what you
[47:57] want to you try to drown me he said you
[47:59] can't do it
[48:03] look at that man beating like he was
[48:05] whatever three or four times in the deep
[48:07] and all this I beat when 40 Stripes
[48:10] saved one which it said 40 would kill
[48:12] you
[48:12] beaten to Pieces guts probably hanging
[48:15] out half the time because of those hooks
[48:17] at the end of that whip to cut
[48:22] and he said
[48:24] how can all things done
[48:31] that I may win Christ
[48:34] and being found in him not having my own
[48:38] what is a soul
[48:40] when God breathes the breath of life
[48:42] into your nostrils and you become a
[48:45] living Soul then you begin then
[48:49] that's on that same message of souls in
[48:52] prison
[48:53] think about it
[48:57] I'm trying to get you to see what a soul
[48:59] is and we I know right now see we're not
[49:01] going to get into what I want to do this
[49:02] evening so that's okay
[49:06] but the soul of man
[49:10] that's why I've tried to preach it to
[49:12] you
[49:13] that God had to come
[49:16] not send somebody else
[49:19] body to body he's my brother my kinsman
[49:23] redeemer
[49:25] Spirit to Spirit he can anoint my spirit
[49:29] and I can see things and
[49:32] they could in the Old Testament but soul
[49:35] to soul he could not get into them in
[49:37] the Old Testament because there was no
[49:38] way to drive that unclean Spirit out of
[49:40] them
[49:43] amen
[49:45] he couldn't come to them as a birth
[49:47] because there was no way to get their
[49:49] life out of them
[49:53] the best they could do is like David
[49:57] go and be in the bed with Bathsheba read
[49:59] your scripture on his way home he said
[50:00] Lord return unto me the joy of thy
[50:02] salvation
[50:04] even Schofield picks it up and says that
[50:09] see because down inside of that man was
[50:12] a soul
[50:15] which was that man
[50:18] and no matter how whether we'll get to
[50:20] it in a little bit whether it's sinner
[50:21] or saint
[50:23] that soul is a real you
[50:26] for what you are
[50:29] yeah but brother Dale I have these
[50:30] problems okay
[50:32] that's human elements we'll have
[50:34] problems in these human elements as long
[50:36] as we're in the human elements but what
[50:38] is your desire
[50:40] all right
[50:41] well I just can't help but go out and do
[50:43] that now you're getting into a problem
[50:45] when you say you can't help
[50:48] now you've got a problem because you're
[50:49] not yielding to what's inside of you
[50:51] that's right we'll get on to that more
[50:53] but think about it
[50:56] you just see what I'm talking about you
[50:58] what it's not that you become a soul
[51:02] that's what you are
[51:06] if we could ever get it out of our
[51:07] stinking heads to think this is
[51:10] something real that you're looking at
[51:12] yeah Matisse what here is tangible
[51:17] whatever get it to the place of
[51:19] realizing God is more real than that
[51:23] you mean Brothers God's got a place
[51:28] well the Bible says he's up in heaven
[51:32] Heaven's not their own Earth and my
[51:33] footstool
[51:35] what else would you build me
[51:40] but I just can't see God being real like
[51:42] you do why not
[51:45] you know why because you've never seen
[51:47] him
[51:51] right
[51:55] but I thought
[51:57] it was more blessed to
[52:00] what
[52:01] believe that
[52:04] have not seen
[52:08] I thought that was the Bible
[52:11] but why don't you open your eyes and
[52:13] look around
[52:16] just look around
[52:19] you're sometimes shut down and get one
[52:21] of them drawings that's off the doctor's
[52:23] office I sat there and look at that and
[52:24] I'm just amazed you sit there and you
[52:26] look at that thing that's all drawn out
[52:27] it's got all them Parts sir and every
[52:30] one of them's got a purpose
[52:37] come on
[52:39] everything bears you can live with some
[52:41] of them Parts yeah
[52:43] but that still don't make you right
[52:47] let's see God can bypass every bit of
[52:49] that sister Carly was living without a
[52:53] a pituitary how you call that big old
[52:55] word you know female part pituitary
[52:57] gland
[52:59] that she was supposed to have been a
[53:01] diabetic
[53:03] because there was nothing to supply
[53:06] and all at once she starts getting sick
[53:10] she goes to the doctor and he takes her
[53:12] off of the sugar medicine what you call
[53:14] it you know
[53:16] you know what she lived until she died
[53:18] without having to take that stuff
[53:20] you tell me what was supplying it
[53:24] well she happened to be born with a
[53:27] with a two pituitary glands
[53:30] I get sick I'm honest
[53:33] I get sick at mine in your stupidity
[53:39] you go to the doctor you come out and
[53:41] hear right here in this church walk
[53:43] outside and see if it ain't right go to
[53:45] the doctor and I say the doctor gave me
[53:46] a complete bill of health this week
[53:49] everything's right
[53:50] ninety percent of you is going to say
[53:52] well so until died because he went away
[53:55] to the doctor he had a complete he had a
[53:57] complete physical and he died two days
[53:58] later you were unbelief
[54:02] you're killing the word
[54:12] why because we're being stupid
[54:16] but so and so tired 30 minutes after on
[54:20] so what
[54:22] yeah
[54:24] you know what you're saying
[54:26] you're saying I don't have faith
[54:30] you're saying you don't have faith by
[54:33] speaking of our stupidity of what
[54:35] science says
[54:39] that's been on my mind for a year or two
[54:41] that's off
[54:45] they'll tell you you go outside what
[54:48] we have Services we have prior you go
[54:51] outside I got a good doctor this week I
[54:54] got an appointment
[54:57] doctor says I got sugar
[55:00] doctor said I got this and that or the
[55:03] other
[55:04] what do you say
[55:08] I thought God was dealing with what we
[55:11] said
[55:12] our confession
[55:15] I'm not telling you you're not sick I'm
[55:17] not a dummy
[55:19] you go to the doctor's office you walk
[55:21] in
[55:24] you explain to the doctor what's wrong
[55:25] with you right
[55:27] he gets paid for you telling him what's
[55:29] wrong with you
[55:30] right
[55:31] that's pretty dumb to start with but
[55:33] that's what happened
[55:36] but instead of saying God said it
[55:39] say that sometime to the doctor and
[55:42] watch him
[55:43] I told you about that time I went to one
[55:45] I asked him I said would you believe
[55:47] that for much my blood pressure has been
[55:49] running 160 something 190 and one over
[55:53] 110.
[55:55] and I said we prayed Sunday morning and
[55:57] I come up here Monday
[55:59] and now you say my blood pressure is 120
[56:01] over 80.
[56:03] do you believe that the nurse said no I
[56:06] went in and told the doctor the doctor
[56:08] said no I don't believe it I come out
[56:10] and told my wife I should get me another
[56:11] doctor I ain't going back to him
[56:18] at least a doctor could say
[56:20] well things do happen he ain't going to
[56:23] do that right because he's losing
[56:25] patience like brother Hal Thomas years
[56:27] ago I don't remember where we was there
[56:29] or whatever but they prayed for him for
[56:30] for he's listening he'll know it they
[56:32] prayed for him for a kidney stone
[56:35] and the doctor done told him it's
[56:37] impossible to pass it it was too big so
[56:40] many centimeters whatever
[56:42] he called the doctor up and he said doc
[56:44] you say I got to get this out he said
[56:45] yep he said I got it in my hand
[56:49] you know what the doctor said don't tell
[56:52] nobody that way I'll lose all my
[56:54] patience
[56:55] something to that degree
[56:59] you say but come on
[57:02] I don't have to live I don't try to live
[57:05] a lie so when you call my house how am I
[57:07] doing
[57:09] my wife even get on to me and say you're
[57:11] going to the doctor
[57:13] tell him what's wrong with you you're
[57:14] going on I say hey Doc how you doing I
[57:16] asked him how he's doing that's the
[57:18] first thing try that sometime just try
[57:21] it and you walk in the office and the
[57:22] doctor comes up and he sticks your hand
[57:24] you say how you doing doc
[57:27] uh
[57:28] you say you call him doc yeah I call him
[57:30] doc cause that's what he is
[57:32] you call it my house and say hey Doc how
[57:34] you doing that means a person
[57:37] he puts his pants on just like mine
[57:42] but I'll just say
[57:46] he said well what's wrong with you I
[57:47] said well I got a bad cold
[57:49] or I'm hurting here am I hurting nothing
[57:51] wrong with that
[57:53] because you're telling him what's wrong
[57:54] with you
[57:56] right
[57:58] and then you take the medicine he gives
[57:59] you
[58:00] and you say thank you doctor but the
[58:02] medicine ain't going to heal me
[58:04] because God is the Healer and you watch
[58:06] him look at you
[58:09] huh
[58:11] but you might get one converted you know
[58:13] we're pretty good to go out and try to
[58:15] convert everybody else along we convert
[58:16] to a doctor
[58:18] okay get off of it
[58:20] listen
[58:22] the real you is what I'm talking to
[58:25] remember that Wednesday
[58:27] I'm not talking to your bodies
[58:29] good bodies is bodies
[58:31] we all got them we got problems
[58:34] Spirits are spirits we all got Spirits
[58:37] we all got problems
[58:40] but speaking to the soul of the
[58:41] individual
[58:45] and what it brought around say
[58:47] look at paragraph 44 are sold in prison
[58:50] then go ahead and pull that one up
[58:51] that's number one
[58:53] that Soul that's in diocy that soul is
[58:56] what God is working on
[58:58] watch if he can only get that nature
[59:04] that spirit
[59:06] to agree with him
[59:09] then the nature dies
[59:13] the nature and the love of the world
[59:15] eyes and the things of the world
[59:21] if you can get that to just just get a
[59:23] person to stop
[59:26] then it's like we say
[59:30] we ask people
[59:31] we try to introduce the message what we
[59:33] try to do you understand the seals you
[59:35] understand the plagues of Halls of drugs
[59:37] well you're trying to make it look like
[59:38] you got something yeah
[59:40] the thing ain't God
[59:42] that's right right
[59:44] start talking to him on the godhead
[59:47] you don't have to jump into the water
[59:49] baptism ask brother dick there how long
[59:51] I talked to him before I brought up
[59:53] water baptism
[59:56] he was already saying himself
[59:59] I see it now it's not three persons
[1:00:04] extreme manifestations of God
[1:00:09] okay you believe that yeah I said okay
[1:00:11] I'm about this water baptism
[1:00:13] you might run in somebody like him that
[1:00:15] already been thinking about it
[1:00:17] you know God does work on both ends
[1:00:21] um
[1:00:22] but you see
[1:00:24] as I said the other day I've quoted over
[1:00:26] and over they said to brother Brandon
[1:00:28] what what must we do to be saved he said
[1:00:30] we tell them what not to do and what to
[1:00:32] do you know quit this quit that don't do
[1:00:35] this don't do that he said they didn't
[1:00:37] ask that question they asked what must
[1:00:39] we do to be saved
[1:00:42] repent everyone and be baptized in the
[1:00:44] name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:00:48] Holy Ghost
[1:00:50] there's no promise any other way
[1:00:53] talking to
[1:00:59] the nature
[1:01:01] that part in there that's motivating us
[1:01:03] now let me explain a little bit your
[1:01:07] you realize every person
[1:01:10] we're going to get to this later don't
[1:01:11] bring it back you realize every person
[1:01:13] in the world
[1:01:17] that Brandon said is born with a gift
[1:01:23] a gift of faith
[1:01:27] an ability to believe
[1:01:30] no brother Wilson okay so glad
[1:01:35] see I was born special I can believe it
[1:01:42] you don't want to talk to me after
[1:01:44] service about that because I'll remind
[1:01:46] you of how long it took me to bury that
[1:01:48] down in there to get you to believe it
[1:01:51] because I know I'm hateful
[1:01:54] but is it the truth
[1:01:56] oh I saw it immediately
[1:02:00] I like sister Gail's way I come in
[1:02:02] fighting
[1:02:06] right
[1:02:08] you come in fighting you're going to
[1:02:09] stay you come in burning like crazy
[1:02:12] you're gonna be like a candle burn at
[1:02:13] both ends you're going to burn out in
[1:02:15] the middle and you're gone
[1:02:16] that's why people don't last too long in
[1:02:18] the message oh yes I see that oh I see
[1:02:21] that well I see that organization is
[1:02:22] wrong
[1:02:27] but what about the what about well I
[1:02:29] ain't going now I'm not going to go to
[1:02:31] that water baptism yet I just see
[1:02:32] organizations wrong you don't see it's
[1:02:34] wrong
[1:02:36] you just see the natural outwards yeah
[1:02:40] because the only way you can see
[1:02:41] anything about organization to be wrong
[1:02:42] is get bored again
[1:02:48] look what he says there on the same
[1:02:50] quote so therefore
[1:02:52] he has partnership you
[1:02:55] talking about the new birth
[1:02:58] going down to paragraph 45. he has
[1:03:00] partnership too you see and taken this
[1:03:03] man Earthly and this eternal spirit and
[1:03:06] put it together
[1:03:08] that's not an anointing on your spirit
[1:03:15] he's talking about the man
[1:03:18] the being that we are that's all that we
[1:03:20] are
[1:03:22] any Partnerships
[1:03:26] you know what he says he says you and
[1:03:28] God together
[1:03:29] as persons he says
[1:03:35] a being
[1:03:37] what we really are
[1:03:44] listen what he goes on to say now
[1:03:46] let me
[1:03:53] yeah
[1:03:54] we'll buy fires trying to prove Satan to
[1:03:57] how real he is but you know that's what
[1:03:59] gets me I will say this and he'll come
[1:04:01] back this evening and pick that up you
[1:04:03] know we think God is just a spirit but
[1:04:05] the devil's real
[1:04:08] hello
[1:04:10] yeah I never heard nobody say the devil
[1:04:12] wasn't real have you
[1:04:14] oh have you ever heard anybody say the
[1:04:15] devil ain't real no he's real
[1:04:18] look what he called me to do
[1:04:23] well just remember God created him
[1:04:26] so God would be more real than he is
[1:04:30] we'll get back on that
[1:04:33] but I want to get on to the point or the
[1:04:34] real you that's what I'm talking about
[1:04:36] Wednesday night so we'll cover this go
[1:04:37] to number two brothers I know we I'm
[1:04:40] having to jump
[1:04:41] number two is the 65 1205 things that
[1:04:46] are to be
[1:04:48] and he's talking about this body being
[1:04:50] like an old coat that you wear uh you
[1:04:52] know
[1:04:53] different things coming down but go
[1:04:55] ahead
[1:04:57] you hang that thing up that's the way
[1:05:00] this whole body is you it's more the
[1:05:03] image of the heavenly
[1:05:04] it is not you
[1:05:07] I mean even the best we can do
[1:05:11] come on we're reading it Wednesday night
[1:05:13] around said what a hypocrite was he said
[1:05:16] it was in Pharisees that with their
[1:05:18] mouth they said they believed what he
[1:05:20] was saying but said with their heart
[1:05:22] they denied what he was a saying and
[1:05:24] that made him a hypocrite
[1:05:28] so something inside of them wouldn't
[1:05:30] write
[1:05:32] it is not you you are on the inside of
[1:05:35] that body how many times we heard the
[1:05:36] prophet say you've never seen me
[1:05:39] he said you see the body I inhabit okay
[1:05:43] you the spirit of God
[1:05:47] is on the inside of that body
[1:05:49] that's what makes the outside come into
[1:05:51] subjection now he's explaining a
[1:05:53] Christian right
[1:05:54] because the inside is pulling it see
[1:05:56] bringing it in line with the word of God
[1:05:59] you're inside you yourself your being
[1:06:05] this body is just an old code and
[1:06:07] someday
[1:06:08] what will you do with it
[1:06:10] for it you was was only in the Garment
[1:06:13] for a while
[1:06:14] this is like the Earthly garment this
[1:06:17] body you your real body your real self
[1:06:20] is on the inside of this old coat that
[1:06:24] you call William Branham you know Susie
[1:06:27] Jones or whatever it is okay
[1:06:31] going around to the last part of the
[1:06:34] that
[1:06:37] let me make sure I got it
[1:06:43] this one is the old coat they've just
[1:06:46] seen that inside of you with the old
[1:06:47] coat all right boy the image
[1:06:50] and watch you what I'm getting to is I'm
[1:06:52] down below but it's in in here the
[1:06:55] people just seeing you this and what you
[1:06:57] was your soul
[1:07:00] what you was your real you was on the
[1:07:04] inside of that
[1:07:08] the real you
[1:07:11] who is the real you
[1:07:17] the real you
[1:07:20] what's the real you
[1:07:23] it's what you are
[1:07:27] all right
[1:07:28] the real you is what you are
[1:07:32] see that's why that when we're of the
[1:07:35] world what do we do
[1:07:37] we live like the world right
[1:07:40] but when we're Christians
[1:07:44] see we're living in the world
[1:07:48] but not of the world
[1:07:52] come on we're not stupid are we
[1:07:55] we eat we drink we play we work we do
[1:07:58] we're all everything's of the world
[1:08:01] right
[1:08:02] everything we do is motivated by the
[1:08:04] world right
[1:08:06] but there's supposed to be something on
[1:08:07] the inside of there
[1:08:10] that's controlling us
[1:08:13] that's the real you
[1:08:15] real use not just this body out here
[1:08:17] right the real you is not your spirit
[1:08:21] the real use what's down on the inside
[1:08:23] whether it's good or bad
[1:08:25] that's what Jesus was talking about the
[1:08:27] Pharisees
[1:08:29] the real you was showing itself in the
[1:08:32] Pharisees when they would confess with
[1:08:34] their mouth
[1:08:37] we know that you are a man sent from God
[1:08:40] because nobody can do what you're doing
[1:08:43] except God be with him but we don't
[1:08:45] believe you are the Messiah
[1:08:49] right
[1:08:51] so who is he talking to
[1:08:56] yeah you know conference being the high
[1:08:58] priest could be such under the anointing
[1:09:02] because he would have praise and you
[1:09:04] know he prophesied we think it's just
[1:09:06] not a prophecy but he prophesied one day
[1:09:09] you think it was just him throwing Jesus
[1:09:11] to the garbage no he was prophesied he
[1:09:14] said it must needs be that one die for
[1:09:16] the sins of the people instead of all to
[1:09:18] die
[1:09:22] maybe he didn't use the word sin in
[1:09:24] there but just go ahead with the other
[1:09:26] right see he was prophesying
[1:09:30] he was the high priest
[1:09:35] but now if you think those things are
[1:09:37] not right you just answer to me one
[1:09:39] thing
[1:09:42] that man could speak under the anointing
[1:09:46] right
[1:09:49] he could walk in and see all of the
[1:09:51] things he was the high priest
[1:09:53] he could see the Shekinah Glory he could
[1:09:55] see the candle he could see everything
[1:09:56] he was a high priest
[1:10:01] and here's a man that he would admit
[1:10:05] that we can't argue with you about the
[1:10:07] signs and wonders
[1:10:09] nobody can do that
[1:10:11] unless it be of God
[1:10:16] put down inside of me something is
[1:10:19] telling me that you ain't right
[1:10:21] my body is going one way my anointing is
[1:10:24] going another way and I'm on the inside
[1:10:27] saying
[1:10:28] I'm going to kill you
[1:10:31] right
[1:10:33] what was motivating him
[1:10:38] it was not the great anointing that was
[1:10:41] on him to prophesy
[1:10:48] that's why brother Randall said you
[1:10:50] can't tell that woman
[1:10:52] that it's wrong for her to wire them
[1:10:54] shorts and things cut her hair he said
[1:10:57] because
[1:10:59] the anointing his owner
[1:11:02] right and inside of her something else
[1:11:08] inside of her was being displayed by her
[1:11:12] flesh
[1:11:13] the nature of her spirit was coming out
[1:11:15] to go wear the shorts and the higher you
[1:11:17] know
[1:11:21] the anointing on her
[1:11:24] most of you remember a woman that worked
[1:11:26] at the plant she was a woman preacher
[1:11:29] and she's you know and I talk with her
[1:11:33] constantly
[1:11:34] because I was not ridiculing her and
[1:11:36] hateful of arrogant ask her a simple
[1:11:39] question one day I said
[1:11:43] I said you believe the Bible
[1:11:46] says yes
[1:11:48] I said you say you're a woman preacher I
[1:11:50] said I'm not going to argue with you
[1:11:51] about it
[1:11:52] you know what I believe and you know
[1:11:54] what I don't believe God called you but
[1:11:56] that's all right if God called you
[1:11:57] that's your business that's between you
[1:11:59] and God but I said if he calls you to
[1:12:02] preach you've got to preach the truth
[1:12:05] she said yes I said what are you going
[1:12:07] to do with your hair in your clothes
[1:12:08] sometime
[1:12:11] that's all I asked her I wasn't hateful
[1:12:15] I'd go to her and say somebody to church
[1:12:17] is sick I called you know I almost
[1:12:19] called her name 15 times but all right
[1:12:21] she wouldn't know I'd say
[1:12:24] we got so and so sick at the church
[1:12:25] he'll pray for him
[1:12:27] hey I believe she's anointed
[1:12:31] and under her anointing she could touch
[1:12:32] God
[1:12:34] come on
[1:12:35] I ain't talking no woman preacher why
[1:12:38] are you afraid
[1:12:44] come on
[1:12:46] but you see what was the inside of her
[1:12:49] overrode what was outside of her
[1:12:55] she hit the lottery one day for two
[1:12:57] thousand dollars
[1:12:59] she never would tell me she hit the
[1:13:01] lottery
[1:13:02] she wouldn't do it
[1:13:04] everybody else were rejoicing over Nails
[1:13:07] blessing from God I said her name then
[1:13:09] her blessing from God
[1:13:13] you know she was blessed she got two
[1:13:16] thousand dollars but she never told me
[1:13:23] and ain't no blessing from God that
[1:13:26] might be your blessing from your God but
[1:13:28] it ain't mine
[1:13:30] all right
[1:13:32] listen what are we
[1:13:35] the people just seeing you this
[1:13:43] you remember Wednesday night we were
[1:13:44] talking about the LIE detector's test
[1:13:46] a lot of texture tests won't do
[1:13:49] and that's not your body new spirit
[1:13:53] come on you say but your spirit no
[1:13:55] that's that real part of you on the
[1:13:57] inside
[1:13:58] you take that lie detectors test that
[1:14:00] thing on the inside it's going to click
[1:14:01] click click
[1:14:03] and you remember what we were talking
[1:14:05] about
[1:14:06] Wednesday night
[1:14:10] um
[1:14:14] I was quoting a while ago the uncertain
[1:14:15] sound
[1:14:18] he said but down on the inside of you
[1:14:22] in the subconscious
[1:14:26] lays a place called The Soul
[1:14:31] and this intellectual mind does not
[1:14:33] govern that vibration of the system
[1:14:39] the soul is the one that can't lie
[1:14:42] and get by with it
[1:14:45] he said in your subconscious
[1:14:48] Blaze
[1:14:51] we see we take all of those
[1:14:52] terminologies
[1:14:54] and we think well
[1:14:57] we're we're you talk about something
[1:14:59] real
[1:15:04] but see we think this is real
[1:15:09] it was not the body we'll get to it you
[1:15:12] see it was not the body of Jesus that
[1:15:14] went to hell right
[1:15:17] right
[1:15:19] he was his soul amen
[1:15:23] doing not his body that come back on the
[1:15:25] day of Pentecost it was not a spirit to
[1:15:28] anoint
[1:15:31] it was his soul
[1:15:34] the person of his being right
[1:15:40] but you see Church
[1:15:42] we want to try to make it just
[1:15:43] something's
[1:15:45] that is not real
[1:15:46] come on I hope you get that if you don't
[1:15:48] get nothing out of what I'm saying you
[1:15:50] know one thing for sure brother Dale
[1:15:51] believes in a real God
[1:15:54] and he believes in a real being
[1:15:57] he believes in a person that you are
[1:16:02] and that's the part I try to deal with
[1:16:07] we'll have trouble with these bodies in
[1:16:09] these Spirits as long as we live
[1:16:16] but yet that Soul inside of there
[1:16:19] is going to live on somewhere
[1:16:22] if nothing else to live on till Judgment
[1:16:24] Day
[1:16:28] and then God will do it remember
[1:16:30] Wednesday if you're not him that can
[1:16:32] destroy the body I fear him that they
[1:16:34] can destroy the soul
[1:16:40] the real you
[1:16:47] see this is just something I live in
[1:16:53] this will be laid down in death if I
[1:16:55] don't come to the change
[1:16:56] but if I come to the change this is not
[1:16:58] going to be laid down this is going to
[1:16:59] be changed
[1:17:01] why because something on the inside of
[1:17:04] the inside
[1:17:07] is of God
[1:17:10] not just an anointing on your spirit to
[1:17:12] make you feel good and Shout
[1:17:14] that's wonderful
[1:17:17] you don't love with your body
[1:17:20] Your Love with your spirit
[1:17:22] you display love with your body your
[1:17:25] spirit is what causes a love factor to
[1:17:26] work but your soul is what you really
[1:17:28] are
[1:17:31] either the nature of my soul is of God
[1:17:33] or it's of the world
[1:17:39] right
[1:17:41] what do we think about it come on
[1:17:42] brother
[1:17:45] the real you
[1:17:50] 'll have to do a two-part of this this
[1:17:52] evening but I was talking about what
[1:17:55] I want to get to the point to see that
[1:17:57] your soul
[1:17:58] being the real you
[1:18:03] that the prophet of God said your soul
[1:18:04] is your theophany
[1:18:06] then we want to put it all the way up
[1:18:08] yonder
[1:18:09] that's automatic just throw it up well
[1:18:12] the prophet said it yeah but what about
[1:18:13] the things he said about life
[1:18:18] what about when he was referring to
[1:18:20] beyond the curtain of time
[1:18:24] and he said the angel of the Lord said
[1:18:26] this is sold under the altar crying how
[1:18:30] long
[1:18:33] but brother Dan we know we got that
[1:18:34] straightened out now I'm quoting 65.
[1:18:40] we'll get to it this evening I'm quoting
[1:18:41] 1965. you say within the shields sold
[1:18:45] 100 still sealed you I ate just a minute
[1:18:51] there is a definition in that that makes
[1:18:53] it
[1:18:54] to show who they are going under the
[1:18:57] fifth sealed you read your scripture it
[1:18:58] says Souls crying how long how long to
[1:19:02] avenge our blood
[1:19:04] he said see there that is not the bride
[1:19:07] because she doesn't want vengeance
[1:19:10] but you can use this souls in prison
[1:19:15] crying how long
[1:19:18] hello
[1:19:19] bless the bride
[1:19:23] see that's where we don't keep it
[1:19:24] straight like we're talking about
[1:19:25] Wednesday night
[1:19:27] Revelation 7 brought around says in one
[1:19:29] quote he says that's not the bride
[1:19:33] and two times after then he says it was
[1:19:35] the bride
[1:19:37] well boy he was massively confused no no
[1:19:39] no no you and me is the one that's
[1:19:42] vastly confused
[1:19:46] but but Revelation 7 is over after
[1:19:49] Revelations 10 he is now you want to
[1:19:52] talk
[1:19:54] we like to quote Revelation 10 7 right
[1:19:56] Revelation 10 7 is
[1:20:00] five chapters after the Rapture
[1:20:03] six chapters matter of fact
[1:20:09] but we love Revelation 10 7.
[1:20:15] you see that's where we take that thing
[1:20:17] and that Soul down inside of there says
[1:20:19] wait a minute there's something wrong
[1:20:22] longing for a truth it's not your body
[1:20:25] it's spirit that longs for the truth
[1:20:26] it's that inside of there
[1:20:29] why didn't run around and say you go out
[1:20:31] here and you see the people he said that
[1:20:32] little woman he said the reason she went
[1:20:34] into the world
[1:20:36] he said because the church
[1:20:39] was the deceiving part
[1:20:43] and since she turned to prostitution
[1:20:48] oh
[1:20:51] because the church
[1:20:53] couldn't bring her to Christ
[1:20:57] well I told that brother at that time he
[1:20:59] said I taken my wife or took her to a
[1:21:01] Pentecostal Church to get her free in
[1:21:03] the spirit
[1:21:04] I said brother you hold it just a minute
[1:21:06] now you tell me a Pentecostal church can
[1:21:09] get them free in the spirit to get the
[1:21:11] Holy Ghost when our true born-again
[1:21:13] Christian believing the message of the
[1:21:15] hour and preaching it can't get it to
[1:21:16] him
[1:21:19] oh
[1:21:22] but see we want to make it so good
[1:21:25] because you see I hit him right in the
[1:21:26] head with it because see he was thinking
[1:21:29] she's got to be free and you're not free
[1:21:31] at Lula she wants to shout and scream
[1:21:33] and holler
[1:21:34] hey
[1:21:36] man
[1:21:37] well why did the new birth
[1:21:46] the new birth is a birth of the word
[1:21:49] not shouting and screaming and hollering
[1:21:51] I believe in it
[1:21:53] you say brother Dale you you're just not
[1:21:55] emotional like everybody else you don't
[1:21:56] know me
[1:21:58] I'm more emotional than anybody in this
[1:21:59] building but I just don't make it in
[1:22:01] front of you
[1:22:03] I make mine to God into God Alone
[1:22:06] because I'm not trying my best to
[1:22:08] convince you of anything
[1:22:13] I've smelled his presence I've heard his
[1:22:15] voice I've I don't have to deny because
[1:22:17] his 40 Years of telling you about it
[1:22:23] but yet that Soul down inside of you is
[1:22:26] what I'm talking to
[1:22:29] to get you to listen to the word
[1:22:33] there's a prophet said then if that soul
[1:22:35] will just stand still long enough
[1:22:39] and listen to the word then the nature
[1:22:42] of it will go out
[1:22:46] see that's what justification
[1:22:47] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:49] Ghost does burns out all of that
[1:22:51] according to the Future home 15 16.
[1:22:55] the future home
[1:22:57] you'll read that message sometimes
[1:23:00] we think it's all talking about some
[1:23:02] World we're going to he said I want one
[1:23:04] thing to get to you and that's to plan a
[1:23:05] Salvation
[1:23:07] but he said it is one thing that the
[1:23:09] soul of the individual goes through the
[1:23:11] same thing the world goes through
[1:23:15] yet he was trying to preach Redemption
[1:23:19] what about it let's stand number 25 in
[1:23:22] the spiral book number 25 on the spiral
[1:23:24] book you forgive me of my actions and
[1:23:26] reactions of anything sounds hateful but
[1:23:29] listen church I'm just tired not
[1:23:32] physically I'm tired of us playing
[1:23:34] little sugar tit Doctrine ideas
[1:23:38] my crazy with this feeling then they're
[1:23:41] feeding your britches
[1:23:48] lady God had somebody to say that to you
[1:23:50] I do that to you to see what you would
[1:23:52] do
[1:23:54] I have to fight that one all the time
[1:23:57] to see what I would do
[1:24:02] you mean I failed at that yes
[1:24:15] I didn't take it correctly
[1:24:24] what about it
[1:24:27] what about that soul in there
[1:24:31] like I said the other night you think
[1:24:34] brother Dale you just don't preach
[1:24:35] simple and get the people in the altar
[1:24:37] you go back with me in the message and
[1:24:40] preach souls in prison and see the order
[1:24:42] is full
[1:24:47] great Revelation now orders are full
[1:24:51] our eyes
[1:24:55] am I right

[1:26:11] of us come to a realization that we're
[1:26:14] talking about something real not talking
[1:26:16] about just spirits and just ideas and
[1:26:19] thoughts but talking about a real
