[0:00] Lord bless bless this map did was run
[0:06] around how about opening it'll work for
[0:07] airport all right we father we thank you
[0:10] Lord for time to gather here today Lord
[0:13] in your name that tell us all these
[0:15] converts and we pray this bless them in
[0:18] their lives oh we know this is an
[0:20] outward display of an in with work is
[0:22] taking place in their hearts the
[0:24] greatest help them to continue live for
[0:26] you all of their lives and the girl for
[0:28] you and help us to live a lot it would
[0:33] be with them every way they go us right
[0:36] fill them with your home
[0:42] before we get started we always reading
[0:44] scripture for bapt in service and come
[0:49] to Romans chapter six and we're the ones
[0:54] that dinner
[1:00] I don't want you coming to the list of
[1:02] this i know everything has been
[1:03] explained let's listen to what Paul says
[1:06] what shall we say then shall we continue
[1:08] in sin that grace may abound to that
[1:11] question so I forbid how shall we that
[1:14] are dead to sin live any longer therein
[1:18] know you not that so many of us as were
[1:21] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:23] into this death it's what I told him we
[1:27] were to get the building means and they
[1:28] looked at me a little strange but I like
[1:30] to wear black like our revelation wear
[1:34] black to appear is what I told us we're
[1:36] going to a funeral today look at me like
[1:39] that sometimes go not right somebody's
[1:43] going to die but you know what there's
[1:47] also resurrection not only in bed
[1:50] resurrection therefore we are buried
[1:53] with him by baptism into death they'll
[1:56] go down then come back up to life that
[2:00] light as Christ was raised up from the
[2:02] dead by the glory of the Father even so
[2:05] we also should walk in newness of life
[2:08] or if you have been planted together in
[2:12] the likeness of his death what you do
[2:13] when you plant something you put it down
[2:15] put it in the ground together in the
[2:18] likeness of his death we shall we shall
[2:20] all be also in vials of his resurrection
[2:24] knowing this there are always crucified
[2:27] with him that the body of sin might be
[2:29] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[2:33] serve sin for he that his dad is free
[2:37] from sin was ever going to go to funeral
[2:41] somebody's going to die it's the old man
[2:44] now if we be dead with Christ we believe
[2:47] that we live with him knowing that
[2:51] Christ being raised from the dead diet
[2:52] no more death have no more dominion over
[2:56] him for him that he died he died into
[2:59] sin once but in that he liveth he liveth
[3:03] unto God likewise bricking he also
[3:06] yourself to be dead indeed
[3:08] sin but alive unto God through Jesus
[3:11] Christ our Lord amen death burial
[3:17] resurrection we are going through today
[3:21] a death we're going to a funeral book
[3:25] not a funeral as in dying and not coming
[3:29] back we're going to put them down and
[3:32] we're going to raise them back up a man
[3:34] and what they have been explained about
[3:37] the name they know we all stand in here
[3:40] I guess 99% of us have been baptized and
[3:43] limb Lord Jesus Christ so that's the
[3:45] family name father's not her name sons
[3:48] not her name Holy Ghost is not a name
[3:51] it's a title to the name of one man the
[3:53] Lord Jesus Christ the father and god of
