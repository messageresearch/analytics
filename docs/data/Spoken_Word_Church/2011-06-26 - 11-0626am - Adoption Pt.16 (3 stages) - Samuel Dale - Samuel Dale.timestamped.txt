[39:57] bunch just enough to get us through that
[40:00] part or or whatever we need okay and is
[40:03] that all announcements
[40:05] I always miss something so
[40:08] but just remember that amen Ephesians 1
[40:11] and Romans 8. father we thank you for
[40:15] this day and the hour that we're living
[40:16] we thank you for the opportunity to be
[40:19] able this day to just sit back and relax
[40:22] a little bit and wait upon you and come
[40:25] together to hear about you because
[40:27] that's our desire we desire to to serve
[40:31] you in this day and time and we know
[40:33] around the world things are getting in
[40:35] bad shape and all but that's in your
[40:37] word that says it would be there we're
[40:39] not one that looks forward to these
[40:42] things but we look at them in reality
[40:43] and see that they are hold it they will
[40:47] be there and it will be so we just pray
[40:49] that you'll give us Grace to stand in
[40:51] the day that we have upon the Earth in
[40:54] our time because our brothers and
[40:56] sisters have stood the test of their
[40:58] time
[40:59] and Lord now is our time to stand our
[41:01] test in time so pray we pray your bless
[41:04] each one God each one now be with the
[41:06] sick among us you promised it you said
[41:08] you sent your word and healed us and
[41:10] delivered us from destruction so we
[41:12] believe that and just have your way now
[41:14] and keep us in Jesus name amen
[41:19] Ephesians
[41:20] one we've been reading this for a while
[41:23] we're maybe the Lord with him by
[41:25] Wednesday we can kind of finish up on
[41:27] what we've been doing on this but not a
[41:30] promise just a thought maybe we'll get
[41:31] to it by Wednesday all right
[41:33] Mercury blessed be the God and father of
[41:36] our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed
[41:37] us with all spiritual blessings in
[41:39] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[41:42] he has chosen Us in him before the
[41:44] foundation of the world that we should
[41:46] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[41:48] love having predestinated us unto the
[41:52] adoption of children by Jesus Christ now
[41:54] remember there's never been a people
[41:56] predestinated unto this way that we're
[41:59] talking about adoption
[42:01] you know and we're reading Romans 2 we
[42:04] have to understand the Redemption of the
[42:05] body nobody's been been predestinated
[42:07] this but you and I are predestinated
[42:09] that's right that's where we're at all
[42:11] right having predestinated us unto the
[42:13] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[42:15] himself according to the good pleasure
[42:17] of his will to the praise of the glory
[42:19] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[42:21] accepted in the Beloved I'll go back to
[42:26] Romans we'll just read Romans 8 23
[42:33] 22 for we know that the whole creation
[42:35] groans and trevaleth and pain together
[42:37] until now
[42:38] and not only they but ours ourselves
[42:42] also who have the first fruits of the
[42:44] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[42:46] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[42:49] wit the Redemption of of our body you
[42:53] may be seated the Lord that is blessing
[42:55] to the reading of the word
[42:58] now remember what we're trying to bring
[43:00] now in the thought we will repeat this
[43:02] in a minute but see it's if you and I
[43:07] don't get the understanding now this is
[43:10] the whole message so if you miss it and
[43:11] something this is what I'm trying to get
[43:14] you to see if we don't get the
[43:16] understanding of the Redemption of the
[43:20] body or a revelation of it then there
[43:23] will not be a Redemption of the body I
[43:25] believe that all right because that's
[43:27] the same thing for healing same thing
[43:30] for salvation same thing for all things
[43:33] that we receive from God because we must
[43:36] receive them by faith
[43:38] by faith we'll see maybe we might have a
[43:41] visitor back there with us and so we're
[43:43] glad to to have him and we say to you
[43:45] welcome and then you come back again you
[43:48] just part of us so we we say welcome to
[43:51] you you know we appreciate it appreciate
[43:53] all of the people on the internet system
[43:56] and all that are there watching and
[44:00] we'll eventually sometime watch and see
[44:02] we pray that God will speak to you and
[44:05] open our understanding
[44:08] but now
[44:10] as I said we were talking about
[44:15] to wit
[44:17] the adoption to it now we've covered
[44:20] adoption in three stages that's what
[44:22] we're talking about you receive a new
[44:25] birth
[44:26] all right and that's when we're adopted
[44:29] into the family of God making us the
[44:31] children of God
[44:32] and then we uh you know we go from that
[44:35] to a position of of uh the same thing as
[44:40] the Lord Jesus did when he came to the
[44:43] Mount of transfiguration to the point of
[44:45] hear ye him and and coming to that place
[44:48] and then the third stage of adoption
[44:51] come into the place that to understand
[44:55] the Redemption of the body then it can
[44:58] take place and there's never as I said
[45:00] there's never been a age
[45:02] that was concerned about the the bodily
[45:05] Redemption our bodily you know doing
[45:08] anything with these bodies right it's
[45:10] never been until this age all right see
[45:13] but that we we see that this age is the
[45:15] age of that and that God has been so uh
[45:19] wondrous to us to to reveal these things
[45:22] to us and to show us in his word
[45:25] and you know like we we talk about
[45:27] Malachi 4 most people will just take
[45:30] Malachi 4 and they they deal with it in
[45:32] a basis of of blood around them to come
[45:35] and and we believe that amen but the
[45:38] scripture there says that the son of
[45:40] righteousness would rise with healings
[45:42] in his wings all right
[45:45] see and then we shall grow up as a
[45:47] calves of a stall which is stored up
[45:50] food all right we'll see then
[45:52] and what I try to get you to see
[45:54] Wednesday
[45:55] that healing campaign that started back
[45:58] in the early part of brother Brown's
[46:00] Ministry there in the 30s and as he
[46:02] began to go forth and and there was a
[46:04] healing campaign and and you you may not
[46:07] understand the way I say things but I I
[46:10] try to get you to think about something
[46:12] but see I believe God was showing back
[46:15] there
[46:16] that he was going to redeem these bodies
[46:20] all right because he would send forth a
[46:23] worldwide sweep of healing campaign to
[46:27] show that see no Divine Healing The
[46:30] Prophet said no Resurrection that's
[46:33] right all right so God was showing to
[46:36] the world that they would actually be a
[46:38] resurrection and watch that in a minute
[46:40] when we we get down to a point you say
[46:42] well we've all believed in the
[46:43] resurrection but how do you believe in
[46:45] it
[46:46] watch that in a minute now as we come
[46:48] back to the point with that but just to
[46:50] to hold that point but see no Divine
[46:52] Healing
[46:53] I gave you a couple of quotes back you
[46:55] know but I do these a lot of times for
[46:57] college knows on the internet and and
[46:59] things like that and they they don't
[47:01] hear the whole story but the prophet
[47:03] said on the angel of the Lord 1951 718
[47:06] he said there's no no Divine Healing
[47:09] you know
[47:10] then there's no Resurrection
[47:12] he said of course Divine Healing is the
[47:15] earnest amen of the redeemed body now I
[47:19] gave you a lot of quotes where he was
[47:20] talking about that the Divine Healing is
[47:22] an Earnest of a glorified body
[47:25] all right see he said now no Divine
[47:28] Healing then no Resurrection
[47:31] right right all right see people didn't
[47:33] you know they didn't understand and they
[47:35] said well we're not to do this you know
[47:37] we're I know who the prophet said we're
[47:39] not to Major on a minor right
[47:42] all right but that was the Day and The
[47:46] Time amen right because that was to
[47:49] attract the tension of the people to get
[47:51] them to hear the message right that was
[47:55] going to be brought but God so gracious
[47:58] showed by healing people you know if
[48:02] you've seen the picture of that uh
[48:03] Florence Nightingales every one of her
[48:05] granddaughter or somebody in their
[48:07] family but anyhow the picture of the
[48:08] girl that was standing there were legs
[48:10] or just maybe you know this big and
[48:13] she's down to like 90 pound or 60 pound
[48:16] or something and and God healed her
[48:19] right you know well see then the world
[48:21] couldn't deny the healing
[48:24] but how did we look at it you say well
[48:26] we've always looked I'll repeat this in
[48:29] a minute
[48:30] even job looked for a resurrection right
[48:34] right
[48:35] always look for a resurrection that was
[48:38] the argument between the Pharisees and
[48:39] the Sadducees I don't understand the
[48:41] Sadducees except that the Sadducees of
[48:44] this message the way they believe it but
[48:46] you know all right because you know all
[48:48] right I don't make lie about it see a
[48:50] lot of people say the sad you know well
[48:52] I don't care about that I'm talking
[48:54] about the difference in their doctrine
[48:56] that the Sadducees didn't believe in the
[48:58] resurrection right right see so then I
[49:01] don't know what they believed right
[49:03] maybe it's like a lot of people today
[49:05] maybe I'm sure they believed in some
[49:07] form
[49:09] over Resurrection all right some form of
[49:12] something or either just put off to
[49:15] another world and you know get a new
[49:17] body or whatever we do but brother
[49:19] random says you can't preach hidden life
[49:22] 1956-13 you cannot preach salvation
[49:26] to the soul
[49:28] without preaching bodily healing
[49:32] you can't preach salvation you can't
[49:34] break the atonement the same same
[49:36] atonement that said five Stripes I'm
[49:38] Healed says there's wounded for our
[49:39] transgressions you know the stripes were
[49:41] healed it's the same atonement right
[49:44] right so we're going to believe in in
[49:46] Salvation for the soul
[49:48] but the doctors will take care of the
[49:50] body Now where's that in the Bible come
[49:52] on brother when there's more dying every
[49:53] day from that and we thank God for the
[49:55] doctors and and all like that and then
[49:57] and we we don't say don't go to them or
[50:00] nothing I went just the other day and
[50:01] and the doctor he got through and
[50:03] running coming there and he listened to
[50:05] my heart and he said Sam he said
[50:09] you got an irregular heartbeat
[50:13] and I said well
[50:15] I should have drank a cup of coffee a
[50:17] while ago
[50:18] that's probably what it is he looked at
[50:22] him and said I think we better run a
[50:24] cardiogram on you she went okay but it
[50:27] was the coffee you know like that to it
[50:29] so he goes out and they come in and they
[50:31] run this you know the cardiogram or what
[50:33] you call it EKGs or whatever all those
[50:35] words I never didn't understand them but
[50:37] anyhow they put all this stuff on them
[50:39] and he'd come back in a little bit he
[50:40] said well I guess it was the coffee
[50:43] EKG or what it was that it showed
[50:45] everything to be normal I said well you
[50:48] know how it is but that's let the doctor
[50:49] tell you everything's okie dokie then
[50:52] you don't have to worry about it you
[50:53] know that way your your mind went well
[50:55] oh god
[50:56] well I got this and remember me Tuesday
[50:59] I got to go he said my thyroids got to
[51:01] order on it or something like that but I
[51:03] don't give a hoot because I I've lived
[51:05] all these years with all of the things
[51:07] that's in my body and I'm 71 so I ain't
[51:09] worried about all these things it's
[51:11] October Richard this morning Wilson I
[51:13] said
[51:13] I don't go every day looking forward to
[51:16] something I just go every day realize
[51:17] they're going to come
[51:19] right I think you don't go every day
[51:22] well I don't know what's coming tomorrow
[51:23] no I don't know you just realize
[51:25] something's coming tomorrow how do we
[51:26] get the one we heard about it but thank
[51:29] God for healing
[51:31] but you see I'm going to tell you
[51:33] everything's all right amen and all of
[51:36] the things but now let's get on down to
[51:38] it
[51:39] but now listen
[51:42] see
[51:43] the I tried to get this point across to
[51:46] you
[51:47] that and I know you know this but
[51:49] there's people that are maybe don't know
[51:51] it and haven't seen it or heard it but
[51:54] see that Divine Healing campaign
[51:57] it was to get to people's attention
[52:00] right that God was alive right amen and
[52:04] living among us that's the way your
[52:06] Prophet described that right and in
[52:08] doing that see then it would bring he
[52:10] said we don't major on a minor and he
[52:12] said salvation is the most important
[52:15] thing right so it was getting the
[52:16] attention of the people to see salvation
[52:19] you know right all right amen that
[52:23] salvation is the real thing is the
[52:25] saving of the soul but then he says you
[52:27] can't preach salvation without preach
[52:29] healing right amen court is in the same
[52:31] atonement that's right okay so he said
[52:33] you don't want to be you'd be breaking
[52:35] up the Bible right the you'd be
[52:37] separating and say well one part's right
[52:39] now the parts not but see then in that
[52:42] healing though it would also meant a
[52:46] message would be coming
[52:50] because God doesn't send signs and
[52:52] wonders without sending a message that's
[52:55] right whether it would be salvation for
[52:57] the yes for the for the soul it would
[52:59] still be a message
[53:01] that would be coming forward all right
[53:03] and so would it be for the understanding
[53:06] the that you and I would have to come to
[53:09] the place
[53:10] to see the message that's right right
[53:14] not to to just just deal with healings
[53:17] and not to just do it but a message
[53:19] would come for it all right now I tried
[53:21] to preach it there Wednesday then about
[53:22] how the Lord Jesus you know right was
[53:25] dealing with the son of man
[53:28] and he had the sign of the son of man
[53:30] the resurrection right was there that's
[53:33] why he could stand there and say
[53:35] I am the resurrection
[53:38] now brother random couldn't stand and
[53:40] say I am the resurrection right
[53:44] but he could stand and say bring me 24
[53:47] of your worst cases and I'll guarantee
[53:49] you healing problem
[53:52] because he was dealing with
[53:55] erection sign which is the prophet see
[53:58] prophetic right all right and dealing in
[54:01] that realm seat then he was welcomed in
[54:05] the early years
[54:07] the Lord Jesus was and brought around
[54:09] what in the early years and oh yeah that
[54:11] the little prophets you know yeah oh
[54:13] we're glad to have him but then as he
[54:15] began to bring his message right
[54:19] then they begin to say you know you can
[54:21] believe him in the healing because he
[54:22] couldn't deny that right that's right
[54:24] yeah but said now when he starts
[54:26] preaching
[54:28] well see that's how narrow-minded the
[54:30] human mind can be right but still
[54:32] because they couldn't match up with any
[54:34] of the signs in the the things that was
[54:37] taking place but they had to explain it
[54:39] to the people
[54:41] like we Baptists you know we said oh
[54:43] yeah we believe in healing we believe in
[54:45] healing but really we don't need healing
[54:48] anymore we go to the doctors
[54:51] well I never did believe it that way
[54:53] when I was there I didn't believe it
[54:55] that away
[54:56] I believe God is the Healer I'm not
[54:58] going to a doctor that tells me he
[55:00] doesn't believe in healing right right I
[55:03] told you what the one that I go to and
[55:04] one of me he said the doctors all said
[55:07] to him how can you believe in healing of
[55:09] the body when you all you know about
[55:11] medicine he said I want to ask you a
[55:13] question how can you believe
[55:15] in the and and see the the healing
[55:18] without knowing it's God right
[55:20] right because there's only one Healer
[55:22] right right there's only one there's
[55:24] only one can take can take care of but
[55:25] see a message
[55:27] I'm out right and brother Branham you
[55:29] see that a message would come forward
[55:34] can you hear that see because it's the
[55:36] signs and wonders was there
[55:40] yeah see they would have to be healing
[55:43] since thanks to father right you know
[55:45] sure but they would have to be a message
[55:48] man
[55:51] that's the point I'm trying to get you
[55:53] to see that there was a message back
[55:55] there yeah right we're going to try to
[55:58] break down something today the I'm like
[56:01] wrote around the early Ministry and in
[56:03] the later part of his ministry all right
[56:05] now see there was a message going
[56:07] forward
[56:09] now the prophet unless he said it in a
[56:11] church Egg book this message you're
[56:12] malachite of four to do two things one
[56:14] turn the hearts of the children back to
[56:15] the faith of the father who revealed the
[56:17] seven Thunders which is revelation
[56:18] obtained in the Seven Seals it'll be
[56:20] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[56:22] that literally turn us back all right
[56:24] so he had to he had to do two things
[56:27] right when he started out he didn't
[56:28] preach to see it yes he preached them in
[56:30] 50 something sure
[56:32] jury breaks the seal to 50 something not
[56:35] long but right in there when he started
[56:36] he preached on the seals but yet he knew
[56:40] he wasn't right because he even preached
[56:42] the white horse rider as being
[56:44] me the Holy Ghost right yep
[56:48] but then when the later when it opened
[56:49] he seen what it was right so just get in
[56:51] mind now what I'm talking about
[56:54] that but uh that get to the point that a
[56:56] message always comes amen
[56:59] amen
[57:00] the healing is to get the people's
[57:02] attention right
[57:04] right see get people to come in and
[57:07] listening the message that's why I said
[57:09] that he started out in his early
[57:10] Ministry he would let people preach
[57:15] and then he'd come out and pray for the
[57:17] sick right well then he started
[57:19] preaching his own sermon
[57:21] well because they couldn't bring the
[57:24] message
[57:24] they wasn't ordained to bring the
[57:26] message
[57:27] so they couldn't do that but you gotta
[57:30] have the restoring of the faith of the
[57:32] fathers right
[57:33] back before you can talk about the
[57:36] prophet in his ministry of what he was
[57:38] to be
[57:39] so we had to to come and restore those
[57:42] things well see that's what he was doing
[57:44] back there
[57:46] in those years of the healing campaign
[57:48] he was preaching us back to the
[57:50] revelation of the faith of the father
[57:53] all right then that was the message
[57:57] are you following me now see the message
[57:59] that you're I'm talking about begin when
[58:02] the prophet began to try to preach us
[58:04] back to what the Bible said
[58:07] all right
[58:09] which would be called the faith of the
[58:10] fathers or what what they were you
[58:12] didn't they didn't take a novice name
[58:14] write the word right it was those who
[58:16] were seasoned in the word that wrote the
[58:18] Bible so then but there would be a
[58:20] healing campaign
[58:22] that's right all right now see then that
[58:26] healing campaign would never leave
[58:30] right amen all right but yet you see the
[58:33] prophet in the end of his ministry with
[58:35] a whole lot less signs and wonders
[58:37] taking place as it was in the early
[58:40] Ministry called the same thing with the
[58:42] Lord Jesus right
[58:43] that's what I tried to get to point
[58:44] across this message fits exactly the
[58:47] Lord Jesus and compares to where what he
[58:50] was doing see the Lord Jesus have a lot
[58:52] of healings and signs and wonders but
[58:53] after he went the amount of
[58:55] transfiguration
[58:57] very little to say it that's right
[59:00] sure there were people healed in
[59:02] different things but not like it was in
[59:03] his early Ministry now you know that's
[59:05] Bible read your Bible amen all right and
[59:08] see then read The Prophet's message and
[59:11] see and hear him
[59:13] declaring and see the healing to take
[59:16] place amen
[59:17] but then you see him begin to taper down
[59:19] see me
[59:21] he was coming to the third pool right
[59:23] amen the opening of the word amen she
[59:26] first pulled is what Divine Healing
[59:28] second pull prophecy third pool is
[59:30] wanting to opening to the word amen but
[59:33] what was prophecy sitting in order of
[59:35] scripture amen
[59:37] the Lord Jesus went out Healing The Sick
[59:40] and got their attention then he started
[59:42] to say I'm my father's one
[59:44] but Iran was getting the attention of
[59:47] the people then he started preaching the
[59:48] faith of the father amen right right but
[59:51] knowing that there would be a message
[59:53] come forth it would go into deeper debts
[59:55] amen
[59:57] but there was a message going forth
[59:59] while the healing was going forward
[1:00:00] that's what I want you to see all right
[1:00:02] all right amen while the healing was
[1:00:04] going forward
[1:00:05] a message was coming and I said that
[1:00:07] about it and Wade said well you maybe
[1:00:09] need to express a little more because I
[1:00:11] said there Wednesday you know that first
[1:00:14] pull was healing the prophet said
[1:00:16] second Paul's prophecy
[1:00:18] all right prophecy is setting in order
[1:00:21] of scripture Look up the word
[1:00:23] that's not prophesy prophecy right amen
[1:00:27] all right there's a difference in the
[1:00:29] two words prophecy prophesy look it up
[1:00:32] man all right so as the prophet was as
[1:00:35] healing was taking place in Jesus
[1:00:37] ministry he began to pray to preach the
[1:00:40] word right amen sitting in order
[1:00:44] the prophet came and he healing started
[1:00:47] taking place then he started setting in
[1:00:50] order to scriptures amen the word that
[1:00:53] we could talk about the faith of the
[1:00:55] father nobody talked about it nobody
[1:00:57] didn't know what the faith of the
[1:00:59] fathers they didn't even know anything
[1:01:00] about it they wasn't expecting it to
[1:01:02] take place right they were just
[1:01:04] rejoicing in a healing campaign and
[1:01:06] saying it's over with we're here you
[1:01:08] remember yeah
[1:01:10] see they said oh the rain brother and
[1:01:13] this is it he said how can you have a
[1:01:15] lot of rain when you ain't even had to
[1:01:17] form a rain right
[1:01:19] boy he tore up their little buddy a
[1:01:21] little little playgrounds didn't he yeah
[1:01:24] I want you to notice that in a minute
[1:01:25] you think of how hard
[1:01:27] and it is so hard to try to probably say
[1:01:30] this easy preaching life
[1:01:33] it's hard to preach true right
[1:01:36] but you think
[1:01:39] of it in this world I'm talking about
[1:01:41] down in our day right
[1:01:45] and stood there and began to try to
[1:01:48] speak about
[1:01:50] no Divine Healing no Resurrection
[1:01:55] that's right
[1:01:59] no glorified body
[1:02:02] what's the mankind didn't believe
[1:02:04] glorified body right you believe in
[1:02:06] getting a new one right I mean you
[1:02:08] believe in throwing this in the way
[1:02:09] smoking a little cigarettes it don't
[1:02:11] make no difference
[1:02:12] you don't throw this thing away and get
[1:02:15] you another one you know
[1:02:18] because that's what mankind was teaching
[1:02:20] right
[1:02:21] and you think of how hard it was
[1:02:24] now let me just say it in plain language
[1:02:26] all right
[1:02:28] had they not been the signs and wonders
[1:02:32] that was promised in the scripture the
[1:02:34] son of righteous wrestling is when had
[1:02:36] that not been the promise and had that
[1:02:38] not taken place how many people do you
[1:02:41] think would have believed wrote around
[1:02:42] him right no
[1:02:44] no come on think about it seriously
[1:02:48] when all of the great big guys you know
[1:02:51] from everybody up to the front down to
[1:02:52] the bottom
[1:02:54] oh we're gonna get us a new body
[1:02:57] we're gonna get us a new body
[1:02:59] and talking about Resurrection right
[1:03:03] yep
[1:03:04] educated people
[1:03:07] but don't you think it really hurt their
[1:03:09] feelings when brother Branham said now
[1:03:12] Resurrection
[1:03:14] doesn't mean replacement
[1:03:19] Dr so-and-so
[1:03:25] if I'd have been there to punch him I
[1:03:26] said why didn't you give us a definite
[1:03:30] why didn't you tell us that's what it
[1:03:31] meant you told us we're gonna get a new
[1:03:33] one yeah
[1:03:34] this little guy that don't know if ABC's
[1:03:37] is telling us we're gonna
[1:03:39] these whole bodies gonna be redeemed
[1:03:41] yeah amen right you think of how hard I
[1:03:44] wrote down emphasize this point you
[1:03:46] think of how hard it was
[1:03:49] right to preach it now I'm gonna go
[1:03:52] ahead with the rest of what I have in
[1:03:54] there
[1:03:55] that's why it's so hard today to try to
[1:03:57] talk about a Redemption of the body
[1:03:59] right
[1:04:00] absolutely see
[1:04:03] because there's not the great healing
[1:04:06] campaign
[1:04:12] right now the healing's still here don't
[1:04:13] misunderstand me right
[1:04:16] we still believe in it we still see it
[1:04:18] right here in many many statements all
[1:04:19] right
[1:04:22] but there's not a healing campaign
[1:04:28] why because see that was to speak of the
[1:04:32] message it would come right
[1:04:34] all right
[1:04:36] the message of the faith of the father
[1:04:38] is being restored right amen
[1:04:42] see now you got to take God's word
[1:04:46] you got to be like sister Hattie right
[1:04:48] when running around with speed she said
[1:04:50] that ain't nothing but the truth it's
[1:04:52] got to be something like that right
[1:04:56] amen see the healing is dropped down
[1:05:00] you don't see the healing like it used
[1:05:02] to be and
[1:05:04] right
[1:05:08] it's not because we're getting older
[1:05:12] I said this 40 years ago
[1:05:15] right
[1:05:16] I was preaching this 40 years ago
[1:05:22] that the world would have more signs and
[1:05:24] wonders if we did because they're only
[1:05:27] dealing with the healing right right
[1:05:30] we're not dealing with healing we're
[1:05:32] dealing with trying to preach the word
[1:05:33] right all right man and to believe the
[1:05:35] word and then let the healings follow it
[1:05:37] right amen amen I thought that's what we
[1:05:39] believe the third pool was was speaking
[1:05:42] the word
[1:05:44] yeah would you say
[1:05:47] and it's so hard to try to preach it
[1:05:50] when you think about a man standing
[1:05:51] against the whole world that's right
[1:05:56] but see I can't stand and do like he did
[1:05:59] because God didn't ordain me to do it
[1:06:00] but he say if you don't believe what I
[1:06:02] do you come up here and let's see you do
[1:06:04] it right
[1:06:06] yep well but they kept their seats
[1:06:09] didn't they all right
[1:06:11] he said you come up here and let's see
[1:06:13] you do it right if you know what the
[1:06:15] word's talking about
[1:06:17] for birthday more religious leaders are
[1:06:19] walking up and down you better make them
[1:06:20] one thing though when they got outside
[1:06:22] the door see
[1:06:24] you know
[1:06:26] oh he's just a smart alec he's no you
[1:06:29] know uneducated idiot and he just you
[1:06:31] know he doesn't know his ABCs he doesn't
[1:06:33] know that we know
[1:06:35] what we know about the Bible
[1:06:38] I wouldn't say that while he's in front
[1:06:40] of him all right yeah
[1:06:43] right right so is it today amen
[1:06:47] people are Yak behind you back but they
[1:06:49] won't come into your face because 40
[1:06:52] years ago I was saying this this is not
[1:06:54] something I've come up with
[1:06:56] I preached it for 40 something years
[1:07:01] to try to show you it's got to be the
[1:07:03] opening of the word right amen people
[1:07:05] when I came into the mission boy blessed
[1:07:07] God one of these days wouldn't be able
[1:07:08] to speak the word I said you got to get
[1:07:09] it before you can speak it
[1:07:12] we got the book
[1:07:15] yeah
[1:07:17] that's what people think today
[1:07:19] they think they have the message
[1:07:23] and make light of other people
[1:07:26] um
[1:07:29] come on let's get down to this to the
[1:07:32] nitty-gritty as we call it the brother
[1:07:34] Maloney used to say get down where the
[1:07:35] the Rope the rubber meets the road let's
[1:07:39] get down to where we're leaving right
[1:07:41] you know and get to the point but look
[1:07:43] look what he says on number
[1:07:46] three of your notes we've read these
[1:07:48] before but let's read it again
[1:07:50] moderate events make clear by prophecy
[1:07:52] in 1965 1206. now remember this message
[1:07:55] started first with Divine Healing
[1:08:02] now that's your professional let's let
[1:08:04] him answer performing miracles
[1:08:07] and if God let that go through an
[1:08:09] ordinary church just like we already had
[1:08:13] then it wasn't God right
[1:08:17] okay
[1:08:20] now watch two minutes ago and watch the
[1:08:22] natural leadership 1965 1207. and any
[1:08:25] message that's come in a genuine born
[1:08:28] message of God
[1:08:30] is different from the old trend
[1:08:33] when a Divine Healing went forth not
[1:08:35] long ago did you notice how the
[1:08:37] impersonators followed it
[1:08:40] see and every one of them went right in
[1:08:44] them organizations
[1:08:46] staying there does anyone know that
[1:08:49] there had to be a message
[1:08:51] follow that why God don't entertain us
[1:08:55] he attracts our attention with something
[1:08:57] and when he attracts our attention
[1:09:00] then he's got the message
[1:09:05] and I gave you one nerve the other day
[1:09:08] where the Prophet said even if signs and
[1:09:10] wonder starts appearing and you stay in
[1:09:13] the same old message
[1:09:17] no I've told you 40 years ago
[1:09:20] that there'll come a time
[1:09:23] and you look out there
[1:09:27] now if you're blind open your eyes go
[1:09:29] and look out there you can see an
[1:09:31] organized religion there's healing
[1:09:33] campaigns and all kinds of things taking
[1:09:34] place and people being healed
[1:09:38] I don't know where that's Church you're
[1:09:39] still down in Florida that Baptist
[1:09:41] Church you've been going for I forgot
[1:09:42] how many years
[1:09:44] that they've been having service every
[1:09:46] day right
[1:09:48] hard for us to get here two or three
[1:09:50] times a week
[1:09:52] it's not English
[1:09:56] you you instead of us
[1:09:58] I say us because you just do the whole
[1:10:01] thing
[1:10:02] go down here you know that yeah
[1:10:05] but now listen
[1:10:07] if a healing campaign starts
[1:10:10] what are we gonna look at
[1:10:16] if a healing campaign was to start what
[1:10:18] are we going to look at it
[1:10:22] I warned you here 40 years ago
[1:10:28] that it would take place in the end time
[1:10:32] that one day all of these doctrines in
[1:10:34] the message
[1:10:36] that healings and things would start
[1:10:38] appearing and people are saying see
[1:10:40] there are my two Soul messages right
[1:10:42] look at the healing
[1:10:44] Mary my seventh under virtual message I
[1:10:47] heard my perusias my River Jordan
[1:10:48] tonight all that
[1:10:51] how many times have I said that to you
[1:10:55] should there come a time when signs and
[1:10:57] wonders will start appearing
[1:10:59] but the prophet said if it's the same
[1:11:01] old message right
[1:11:06] don't do it right
[1:11:08] don't follow it
[1:11:10] I worked a man coming to lay down ten
[1:11:12] dead people in there and the cat gets
[1:11:14] ready then done been bombed
[1:11:16] and he says to prove that my two Soul
[1:11:19] doctrines right or my my Baptist
[1:11:21] Doctrine or anything that you want to
[1:11:23] bring me you know put a name to it
[1:11:26] all he's going to be raised in the dead
[1:11:27] and they're all raised now what are you
[1:11:29] going to do
[1:11:32] it the Bible says see we quote one but
[1:11:35] it won't like the other one one says if
[1:11:37] a prophet comes and speaks and it comes
[1:11:39] to pass you better hear the prophet
[1:11:40] that's one scripture but there's another
[1:11:42] scripture in there
[1:11:44] it said if a prophet comes and brings
[1:11:46] you a sign and it come to pass
[1:11:50] and he take you to another God
[1:11:52] don't believe him cause I sent it among
[1:11:55] you to try you remember about a month or
[1:11:57] two or your while back I was preaching
[1:11:59] on that
[1:12:02] what you see
[1:12:04] we want something to look at
[1:12:08] to crash hold on to it
[1:12:12] instead of just taking God's word
[1:12:16] that's the only way I've ever got my
[1:12:18] healing or anything is just taking God's
[1:12:20] word
[1:12:21] and just say buy Stripes I'm Healed
[1:12:26] and then just have to wait until it
[1:12:27] comes to pass
[1:12:30] I've seen healings and miracles and
[1:12:32] wonders yes
[1:12:33] but I've seen that we have to stand on
[1:12:36] God's word because he's trying us to see
[1:12:38] what we'll do but you see that's passing
[1:12:40] the people and so then they start
[1:12:42] running for something else
[1:12:44] yeah that's right and then they claimed
[1:12:46] it out trying to prop it up
[1:12:48] I'm not trying to prop up nothing I'm
[1:12:50] telling it like it is
[1:12:52] that's what people don't like when you
[1:12:54] tell it like it is but you see the
[1:12:56] message
[1:12:58] that would follow the healing
[1:13:01] all right now get the two points you
[1:13:03] want to talk about there was a message
[1:13:05] followed the healing campaign that
[1:13:08] started in the 30s right
[1:13:12] okay
[1:13:15] a message followed taking and going back
[1:13:18] in the prophet preaching stature perfect
[1:13:20] man and all those messages greatest
[1:13:22] battle ever fought all those things
[1:13:23] trying to restore the face of the father
[1:13:25] right
[1:13:28] right right
[1:13:31] all right
[1:13:32] telling the Pentecostal people right
[1:13:35] here is where you fail
[1:13:37] did you thought we got it all
[1:13:42] but he said I come to tell you you can't
[1:13:44] have a letter right until you get a
[1:13:46] former running right amen and they
[1:13:48] didn't even have a former reign of the
[1:13:50] faith of the fathers let alone the
[1:13:52] prophet's message that's right
[1:14:00] let me get to this point
[1:14:03] do you say what brought it down
[1:14:05] everybody believes in a resurrection
[1:14:10] how do you believe it
[1:14:13] right
[1:14:15] sure mankind has always believed in the
[1:14:18] resurrection but like I said a while ago
[1:14:20] you never looked up the word
[1:14:22] Resurrection
[1:14:24] we didn't do that
[1:14:26] when you want to look oh one of these
[1:14:28] days
[1:14:30] yep but Resurrection don't mean percent
[1:14:34] put one thing down drop a book pick up
[1:14:36] another book doesn't mean that
[1:14:39] probably said this same body that goes
[1:14:41] down got a raise that's Resurrection
[1:14:42] amen but how many people wanted to
[1:14:44] believe it with a man with a seventh
[1:14:46] grade education
[1:14:48] like I said they couldn't argue the
[1:14:50] signs and the Wonders but when they got
[1:14:52] over in her little compartments talking
[1:14:53] later you know he just don't understand
[1:14:56] somebody
[1:14:57] ought to said don't understand
[1:15:00] you remember the man that was blind
[1:15:02] I might unless if I get my right one and
[1:15:05] was healed
[1:15:08] even his mom and daddy got scared
[1:15:13] because they wanted to know who healed
[1:15:16] him Mama and Daddy got scared because
[1:15:18] they knew they'd be thrown out of the
[1:15:19] church right
[1:15:21] and Mom and Daddy said ask him he's of
[1:15:25] age
[1:15:27] you remember that in the Bible yeah ask
[1:15:30] him about it we ain't taking no changes
[1:15:32] hey you know
[1:15:34] there's something
[1:15:40] that's why I'll tell you I don't care if
[1:15:43] it's a song you hear that the Beatles
[1:15:45] play and your heel God does the healing
[1:15:48] amen amen amen
[1:15:51] that's what you see
[1:15:53] if you remember one day
[1:15:56] now to get the point of what we're
[1:15:58] talking about Resurrection
[1:16:00] you remember one day there in the
[1:16:01] scripture
[1:16:03] Lazarus died right yes right right yep
[1:16:08] you remember the Lord Jesus just kept
[1:16:11] going
[1:16:12] when they said he worded he's sick
[1:16:16] so finally the disciples couldn't
[1:16:17] understand it real good right
[1:16:20] Jesus said uh
[1:16:23] Lazarus you know
[1:16:25] he sleep but he's gonna go waking
[1:16:28] he's
[1:16:30] what do you mean he said Lazarus is dead
[1:16:33] he finally just had to speak plain
[1:16:35] language to him right Lazarus is dead
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:39] so they got over there and here comes
[1:16:41] Mata
[1:16:44] Lord Jesus if you hadn't been here
[1:16:48] right read your scripture if you hadn't
[1:16:51] been here
[1:16:52] Lazarus wouldn't have died
[1:16:56] yep
[1:17:00] Bishop where did you bury him
[1:17:04] foreign
[1:17:06] oh yes Lord Jesus Christ we believe it's
[1:17:11] John it's in the Gospel of John
[1:17:14] oh yeah
[1:17:16] we believe in a resurrection one day
[1:17:21] everybody's going to raise because they
[1:17:23] knew the scripture said that
[1:17:25] they were Pharisees not Sadducees right
[1:17:31] but see the surprise was when Jesus said
[1:17:33] I am the resume amen amen
[1:17:38] well we don't understand your message
[1:17:42] come on trying to illustrate right right
[1:17:45] we don't understand your message
[1:17:49] he said if you can't believe the message
[1:17:51] I bring he said show me the grave
[1:17:55] come on
[1:17:56] he said if you don't believe the message
[1:17:58] I bring how about the signs and the
[1:17:59] Wonders
[1:18:01] and see Martha didn't believe that who
[1:18:03] he was
[1:18:04] but he said take me to the Grave
[1:18:08] he proved he was the resurrection right
[1:18:12] that's right
[1:18:14] but you see we all believe in a
[1:18:16] resurrection
[1:18:17] but do we believe it like Martha yes one
[1:18:20] of these days do we believe it like Joe
[1:18:22] one of these days
[1:18:27] let's see something happened to job one
[1:18:29] day and God said stand up on your feet
[1:18:31] and get out of your own understanding
[1:18:32] right
[1:18:34] and he come forth he said I know my
[1:18:36] redeemer liveth in the last days he'll
[1:18:37] be up on the earth and I'll see him for
[1:18:39] myself and not for another
[1:18:41] amen peace all the resurrection
[1:18:44] when are we going to see the
[1:18:45] resurrection amen right
[1:18:48] do you understand what I'm getting at
[1:18:49] yes
[1:18:50] a message
[1:18:55] a message Jesus told Martha the message
[1:18:58] all right
[1:19:00] let's get let's read hypocrite what is
[1:19:03] it John what I got to wrote down in here
[1:19:08] somebody find it I don't know it's well
[1:19:11] where my nose is John what
[1:19:13] Young Living all right let's just read
[1:19:15] that let's see what Jesus said
[1:19:18] he said a lot more than what we think
[1:19:30] what scripture is it but I can't even
[1:19:32] find anything
[1:19:35] all right
[1:19:40] all right let's back that right about
[1:19:42] yeah
[1:19:45] let's go back up to 20.
[1:19:47] let's go back and just prove the point
[1:19:49] let's go back to verse 22 21. they said
[1:19:52] Martha unto Jesus Lord if not it has
[1:19:54] been here my brother had not died but I
[1:19:57] know that even now whatsoever thou will
[1:19:59] ask of God God will give it thee see she
[1:20:02] still look for one up younger and one
[1:20:03] down here
[1:20:05] Jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[1:20:07] rise again listen
[1:20:10] verse 24 Moses saith unto him I know
[1:20:13] that he shall rise again in the
[1:20:15] resurrection at the last day
[1:20:18] Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:20:20] resurrection and the life right
[1:20:26] now once this is it have you ever
[1:20:28] listened to the rest of what he said
[1:20:31] oh me I am the resurrection in the life
[1:20:35] he that believeth in me amen though he
[1:20:39] were dead
[1:20:41] yet shall he live amen
[1:20:46] he not only spoke to her of a
[1:20:47] resurrection of Lazarus his message was
[1:20:50] to tell her that one day we will stand
[1:20:53] in a glorified body right and whosoever
[1:20:56] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:20:58] die amen
[1:21:01] oh now what that means Brother David
[1:21:04] that means that we we don't die
[1:21:09] we go to the grave and we come out amen
[1:21:13] but that wasn't what Jesus was saying
[1:21:15] that's right
[1:21:18] he's saying
[1:21:20] I am the resurrection amen
[1:21:24] in one day somebody will catch it come
[1:21:28] on brother and when they catch it they
[1:21:30] won't die you say how do you know cause
[1:21:32] Paul said that's right in the same
[1:21:35] spirit that Jesus spoke it in will be
[1:21:38] changed a moment to drink of an eye the
[1:21:40] last Trump for the trumpet shall sign
[1:21:44] amen
[1:21:45] listen
[1:21:47] Jesus did
[1:21:48] he that believeth in me shall never die
[1:21:52] believe it's not this
[1:21:56] because then he went and raised to death
[1:21:59] he preached his message and then he
[1:22:01] raised the Dead
[1:22:02] the prophet preached the message back
[1:22:05] there in the beginning in the 30s and on
[1:22:07] the end of the 40s and coming on in that
[1:22:09] we only have from 49 I think or 47 47 we
[1:22:13] only have 47 up at least you know
[1:22:16] counting the message the prophet
[1:22:17] recorded called recording systems and
[1:22:19] things that they've done
[1:22:21] but yet he would go out and start
[1:22:23] preaching
[1:22:26] dealing would take place
[1:22:29] to prove that what he was preaching was
[1:22:31] right
[1:22:35] yep how many times you ever heard him
[1:22:37] say if what I've told you is the truth
[1:22:40] let God come behind me now that's right
[1:22:44] and prove it and you know what God came
[1:22:46] by behind him and proved it yes except
[1:22:50] for people don't understand right you
[1:22:52] know that even when he was preaching the
[1:22:54] white horse rider wrong and preaching it
[1:22:57] as the Holy Spirit check the message
[1:22:59] that he said that in and see if healings
[1:23:03] and signs didn't take place
[1:23:07] all right
[1:23:10] you see yeah but brother Dale he's
[1:23:12] preaching wrong
[1:23:15] there was nobody in this world
[1:23:19] could tell him what was right right
[1:23:23] and God went to his ignorance
[1:23:26] until the day come is that scripture
[1:23:28] right yeah
[1:23:31] when the day came that God revealed it
[1:23:33] to him God didn't win no more that's
[1:23:35] right
[1:23:36] God winked at them because there was
[1:23:38] nobody who could tell that Prophet like
[1:23:41] I told you if you don't believe it go
[1:23:42] back and just think about it sensibly
[1:23:44] remember where you came from
[1:23:47] you came from churches 90 percent of
[1:23:50] what's here came from organized religion
[1:23:52] churches
[1:23:54] and you know every one of them
[1:23:57] thought we're going to get a new body
[1:23:59] right
[1:24:01] like I said even if they did teach
[1:24:04] anything about it of a change it was
[1:24:06] like we was we read it and then turned
[1:24:08] around and said we're going to get a new
[1:24:10] one we read Paul the chain in the
[1:24:12] morning and still say we're gonna get a
[1:24:15] new one
[1:24:16] it's all no we didn't well I tell you
[1:24:18] something we believe because not to
[1:24:20] believe in the resurrection right yep
[1:24:25] right right is that saying about the
[1:24:28] blind man while ago what did he say
[1:24:32] when they brought him in after his mom
[1:24:34] and dad he wouldn't even agree would
[1:24:35] help him they brought him in to talk to
[1:24:37] him read your Bible
[1:24:39] give God the glory
[1:24:42] they said
[1:24:44] he said well now let me ask you one
[1:24:46] question I'm paraphrasing this but he
[1:24:47] said let me ask you one question he said
[1:24:50] now I was blind and everybody knows I
[1:24:52] was blind
[1:24:53] but now I can see
[1:24:56] and he said show me where you ever done
[1:24:59] it right
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:02] he said it and really if you're reading
[1:25:04] the scripture he said show me in the
[1:25:05] Bible where anybody would ever blind and
[1:25:08] saw reach a scripture right right now he
[1:25:10] wasn't meaning there wasn't people back
[1:25:12] in the Old Testament didn't get healed
[1:25:13] he's just making his point strong
[1:25:17] did you not show me where you'd knew it
[1:25:19] right
[1:25:21] I said I was blind and this man gave me
[1:25:23] my side of you
[1:25:27] oh let's see you do it
[1:25:32] all right
[1:25:35] how many show brother Dale where he's
[1:25:37] ever went off the message
[1:25:40] but you better bring your clothes with
[1:25:42] you when you're coming but
[1:25:45] what I mean by that is you were going to
[1:25:47] have a little time talking and then
[1:25:48] we're going to talk about all of the
[1:25:49] things you followed
[1:25:51] see that's why people won't come and
[1:25:52] talk to me
[1:25:54] because my memory is still good at 71
[1:25:56] and I can remember all the doctrines
[1:25:57] that people have been into and where I
[1:26:00] had to dig some of them out of it
[1:26:02] yeah but it's like I dug a whole church
[1:26:03] out of a polygamy one time you know what
[1:26:06] a year or so later I called up there to
[1:26:08] talk to the man he didn't even know who
[1:26:10] I was
[1:26:11] brother who
[1:26:16] you think it won't turn against you
[1:26:18] and I dug a whole church out of where
[1:26:20] they were already planning on who was
[1:26:22] going home who
[1:26:27] 'd you see
[1:26:28] people don't pay no attention to those
[1:26:30] things
[1:26:34] people don't like it that's why they
[1:26:36] won't come
[1:26:38] well if they won't come then there's one
[1:26:40] thing for about it they must be obscure
[1:26:41] to come
[1:26:43] when I'm like this like I've always said
[1:26:47] when it comes to a day
[1:26:49] and these doctrines and ideas comes up
[1:26:51] and a man comes up and said prove it if
[1:26:53] I don't get up and walk up there if you
[1:26:55] don't get me by the seat in the bridges
[1:26:56] and nap in the neck and cure me up there
[1:26:58] there's something wrong with you that's
[1:27:00] right because I'll do you that way
[1:27:02] all right you tell me what you believe
[1:27:03] you better be ready to stand on it all
[1:27:06] right amen somebody challenges you
[1:27:09] better be ready to stand on what you
[1:27:11] well I didn't want to hurt no feeling
[1:27:12] Don't Wanna Hurt no feelings
[1:27:15] that's right
[1:27:19] used to say Hogwarts
[1:27:22] that's right but I got a big red thing
[1:27:24] you think of how much that profit
[1:27:27] how that he tried his best to preach
[1:27:30] of the resurrection and God came behind
[1:27:33] him and proved the resurrection was Dire
[1:27:39] and yet how many believe it right
[1:27:44] come on how many believed you
[1:27:48] sad quotes
[1:27:50] I seen God
[1:27:52] but we won't talk about his Doctrine you
[1:27:55] know
[1:28:00] we won't talk about that another way
[1:28:03] about a lady that was a tight on them
[1:28:04] new brother smoking them newer and I'll
[1:28:06] try to think of her name one of these
[1:28:07] days and
[1:28:10] she prayed for the sick they asked her
[1:28:12] about brother Brown she said well I
[1:28:13] guess I never seen no greater except in
[1:28:15] my own Ministry
[1:28:20] that's how we could be yeah all right
[1:28:23] let's get on down with it
[1:28:25] see folks
[1:28:29] then the prophet had to preach and the
[1:28:31] healings was taking place to match it
[1:28:33] first pull up second pull was exactly in
[1:28:35] line right her first pull was healing
[1:28:42] was prophecy sitting in order of
[1:28:45] scriptures Look up the word when you get
[1:28:46] home right
[1:28:48] getting in order of scriptures he was
[1:28:51] sitting in order the faith of the
[1:28:53] fathers telling us the Bible means what
[1:28:55] it says that's right
[1:28:57] he didn't change the Bible it was our
[1:29:00] thoughts and it changed it come on the
[1:29:03] Bible never taught a trinity
[1:29:06] it never caught Eternal Hells or stuff
[1:29:08] like that
[1:29:10] but yet we thought it did yeah
[1:29:15] see the prophet had to come and
[1:29:16] straighten all that out before he could
[1:29:19] get into any part of his own
[1:29:21] right I was watching it
[1:29:24] see where we're talking about on the
[1:29:26] study of the adoption in three stages
[1:29:28] we've come to the bases of talking about
[1:29:31] here ye him where the Lord Jesus on the
[1:29:33] Mount of transfiguration
[1:29:35] and we see that from the minor
[1:29:38] Transfiguration he began to as I said
[1:29:41] the other day bring the seals and the
[1:29:44] things right on his way to Calvary he
[1:29:48] began to bring a deeper message
[1:29:51] than the message he had been bringing
[1:29:53] amen
[1:29:55] are you listening
[1:30:00] in his early Ministry they could follow
[1:30:02] him a little bit but when he began to
[1:30:03] say I'm my father's one
[1:30:05] they didn't like that right how much was
[1:30:08] it when he got into the seals and
[1:30:10] preached Matthew 24.
[1:30:13] when he preached six seals they didn't
[1:30:16] even know what in the world it was about
[1:30:17] it right I asked you to show me
[1:30:20] commentators and even you sure in the
[1:30:22] Baptist Church we talked about the six
[1:30:23] seals of tribulation
[1:30:27] we talked about that in the Baptist
[1:30:29] Church I remember that
[1:30:30] what do you think we understood the
[1:30:32] first one or anything else no no no we
[1:30:34] didn't know but still just get the point
[1:30:38] but see it come to a place
[1:30:41] when that Prophet had finished
[1:30:45] bringing
[1:30:46] the message he said it took him 30
[1:30:48] something years to reach statue a
[1:30:49] perfect man
[1:30:52] now here's one said that go to the books
[1:30:54] that's your perfect man look he's 30
[1:30:56] something years to be able to bring that
[1:30:57] message okay
[1:30:59] and how many people even still believed
[1:31:02] him as I said right
[1:31:05] I come to people of this message there's
[1:31:07] a big portion of them still believe
[1:31:08] we're going to get us another body
[1:31:11] I don't believe in this body being
[1:31:13] redeemed if we're going to get us a new
[1:31:14] body right and like I said there
[1:31:16] Wednesday someone will say new and you
[1:31:19] don't know what their meaning
[1:31:21] if you question oh yeah yeah
[1:31:26] I just didn't explain that
[1:31:28] no you left it to where people could
[1:31:31] believe what they want to about what you
[1:31:33] said all right right those preachers
[1:31:35] don't like that
[1:31:37] that's why I like to say it where
[1:31:39] there's no problem you don't have to
[1:31:41] worry about what brother Dale believes
[1:31:42] right right
[1:31:45] ask a lady one time what did their
[1:31:46] Pastor preach she'd come from there and
[1:31:48] come here and been there for years and
[1:31:49] years I said what do you preach on the
[1:31:50] show she said I ain't never heard him
[1:31:52] never heard any preach about it
[1:31:55] that's Atlanta okay
[1:31:58] but now watch
[1:32:03] in that early Ministry
[1:32:07] a message went forth
[1:32:10] that's why people don't understand this
[1:32:12] when we get down in a minute and we
[1:32:14] start reading it we have time without we
[1:32:15] pick a decision when they start talking
[1:32:16] about the prophet said his message begun
[1:32:18] in the seals right yep
[1:32:21] well what do you mean we're going to see
[1:32:23] I appreciate it for you
[1:32:26] yeah he had to destroy the faith of the
[1:32:28] fathers yeah because that was down and
[1:32:31] gone Hallelujah
[1:32:34] that's what he was doing right amen and
[1:32:36] that's what God was vindicating right
[1:32:38] amen that he was right amen
[1:32:42] he was bringing the message and the
[1:32:44] healings and the signs and the Wonders
[1:32:46] first book second four was laying right
[1:32:48] together
[1:32:48] don't just abruptly take one make it
[1:32:51] this and make this there's no hearing
[1:32:53] this is what I want to call the first
[1:32:54] Bulldog into the word second pull to
[1:32:56] open the word third pool's opening
[1:32:57] that's the best way I can say it after
[1:33:00] 40 years
[1:33:01] right
[1:33:03] and you come show me that's wrong
[1:33:07] because that's what he was doing you
[1:33:09] show me under the first pool
[1:33:11] you know what I'm fixing to show you
[1:33:13] most study run around and reach out and
[1:33:15] take a person by the hand he said see
[1:33:17] you I take my watch off and she called
[1:33:18] it'll it'll just destroy he'd take him
[1:33:20] by the hand he said look at here he said
[1:33:22] see all them bumps on my hand he said
[1:33:24] you got cancer
[1:33:25] that was a gift right right
[1:33:28] cause impersonators to come out you know
[1:33:30] failed at seen it this that the other
[1:33:33] he couldn't help that but he's doing
[1:33:35] what was right
[1:33:36] but what was so amazing you don't even
[1:33:38] listen to what he was saying and he said
[1:33:40] see there he said you got cancer my hand
[1:33:42] shows that he says only left long
[1:33:45] now what showed him that
[1:33:50] the opening of the word
[1:33:52] right if I can read it right he said you
[1:33:55] got cancer when you left lung you got
[1:33:57] cancer here you got cancer in there what
[1:33:58] showed him that the hand vibration was
[1:34:01] one thing
[1:34:03] the boxer on the hand was a gift
[1:34:06] that just showed you had certain
[1:34:07] diseases
[1:34:10] you see the opening of the word was
[1:34:12] taking place in the early Ministry of
[1:34:13] the Prophet that's my people couldn't
[1:34:15] follow me
[1:34:18] he walked out there and going on up into
[1:34:20] the last part of 62 and over towards 63.
[1:34:23] you've just just dying down looked like
[1:34:25] wouldn't it yep right
[1:34:27] friction the greatest makes the world
[1:34:30] had ever heard outside of the days of
[1:34:32] the Apostles
[1:34:34] and God proven it was signs and wonders
[1:34:36] right
[1:34:40] the message would follow
[1:34:44] and it did right
[1:34:46] now let's get on down to where we're at
[1:34:49] see the Divine Healing was to get the
[1:34:51] attention of the people so that they
[1:34:53] would believe that God is alive brother
[1:34:55] Brown said
[1:34:56] and living among us see
[1:35:00] because that's what healing shows God
[1:35:01] being alive
[1:35:03] all right now let's get a few of these
[1:35:05] because we'll try to catch something
[1:35:08] see then the message declared the
[1:35:10] healing and things to be right into
[1:35:12] healing declared the message to be right
[1:35:14] you agree right
[1:35:16] amen the prophet preach the message God
[1:35:18] come behind him and healed
[1:35:20] we went together same things the Lord
[1:35:21] Jesus he would go out there and preach
[1:35:23] the message that anybody over sick
[1:35:25] and to show you you say well what about
[1:35:27] right around Circle well what about the
[1:35:29] Lord Jesus when he had the legal cities
[1:35:31] there because he said he could not heal
[1:35:33] nobody in that City that's right because
[1:35:35] of their unbelief
[1:35:37] almighty God in flesh could not heal
[1:35:41] read your Bible
[1:35:43] because of their unbelief
[1:35:47] what about over to the wood of the
[1:35:49] little girl when he put everybody out in
[1:35:51] the room except Peter James and John to
[1:35:53] get out of here there's too much
[1:35:54] unbelief in here I can't do it and when
[1:35:56] they got out he raised the Dead all
[1:35:58] right read your Bible
[1:36:01] that's right
[1:36:03] because God can't go over your free more
[1:36:04] agency right
[1:36:06] that's right he has to allow that to
[1:36:08] where you can do it but now listen
[1:36:12] but then the prophet knew also
[1:36:17] that while he was preaching that message
[1:36:20] yep
[1:36:21] I believe he come to a realization that
[1:36:24] that wasn't the message he come to bring
[1:36:26] right
[1:36:27] that's why he would say
[1:36:30] I've laid a foundation Maybe
[1:36:32] for somebody else
[1:36:35] he said if that be true then I'd be
[1:36:37] going off the scene
[1:36:39] you remember those statements
[1:36:42] see he knew as he was coming up in
[1:36:45] there was a message to come cause
[1:36:48] revisions and the dreams and the things
[1:36:50] started taking place
[1:36:53] all right and he began to see that he
[1:36:56] had to go to Arizona and connect with
[1:36:57] angels and come back and things like
[1:36:59] that
[1:37:02] now look what he began to say
[1:37:05] does everybody understand what I'm
[1:37:06] saying now I want to make sure that's
[1:37:07] right where you can understand it
[1:37:12] was a healing campaign went out that was
[1:37:14] a message went with it but it was the
[1:37:17] message of the faith of the father
[1:37:22] and when that become to a position then
[1:37:24] the prophet could begin to start looking
[1:37:26] for his own message right
[1:37:29] because he knew he was bringing back
[1:37:31] like they did he said when he went
[1:37:32] beyond the curtain of time what did he
[1:37:34] say
[1:37:36] they told him to make me do that he said
[1:37:37] well Peter and then be judged said yes
[1:37:40] he said then I'll be there because I
[1:37:43] preached exactly like Peter Neal
[1:37:45] go on the Statue of a perfect man where
[1:37:47] he said them disciples they were men a
[1:37:50] few words and they got in the Pulpit he
[1:37:51] said then when it come down to the point
[1:37:53] like this he said it it would come to
[1:37:55] her that those disciples had the least
[1:37:57] little nods from God
[1:37:59] you keep reading about maybe a dozen
[1:38:02] paragraphs or less and he'll see there I
[1:38:04] was waiting about praying for that
[1:38:06] little child and he said I was waiting
[1:38:08] he said and I got a little nod from God
[1:38:11] all right
[1:38:13] you should have not went forth and it
[1:38:15] was delivered amen sure
[1:38:17] and we're standing
[1:38:26] do you believe in the third poll asked
[1:38:28] to speak the word
[1:38:30] right
[1:38:31] so then if they're going to be a third
[1:38:33] foolish to speak in the word
[1:38:35] and signs and wonders father there's got
[1:38:37] to be a message
[1:38:40] are you listening so look at number five
[1:38:42] on your note
[1:38:45] let's just read with you
[1:38:47] two I'll read real fast because I've
[1:38:49] been doing this for 40 years to you
[1:38:52] but not to people out there that are
[1:38:53] listening to some new ones that are
[1:38:54] coming in
[1:38:57] but look at what he said on the
[1:38:58] leadership he said it was to get there
[1:38:59] what he gets message to attract the
[1:39:01] attention
[1:39:02] all right look at souls in prison 1963
[1:39:05] 11 10. it's run out now this is 63. I
[1:39:10] asked during the opening of the season
[1:39:11] right okay it's done it's finished
[1:39:14] and then the scripture says at the
[1:39:17] message of the seventh Earthly Angel the
[1:39:20] messenger on Earth
[1:39:21] the seventh and last Church age at the
[1:39:24] beginning of its Ministry when he starts
[1:39:26] off into the Earth at that time the
[1:39:29] mystery of God of these seals should be
[1:39:31] made known by that time now we see where
[1:39:34] we're at could it be friends could it be
[1:39:37] notice all possible he said well I said
[1:39:40] he said that's when he started now
[1:39:43] see how the human mind
[1:39:47] just in case you're clicked that away
[1:39:50] that's what I like to do
[1:39:53] I like to pick up your mind and express
[1:39:55] it
[1:39:57] you said what he just said when he first
[1:39:59] begins his ministry okay let's read some
[1:40:01] more now
[1:40:02] trying to do go out of service 1965 718.
[1:40:05] you read all this in there and don't
[1:40:07] worry about it it'll be there I just
[1:40:09] underlined something for you we'd say
[1:40:10] reading the whole thing have it in the
[1:40:13] sounding of the last Angel Revelation 10
[1:40:15] in the days of the seventh angel of
[1:40:17] these Mysteries that's all been why did
[1:40:20] the methodists do this in the Baptist
[1:40:21] and the Church of Christ and the Jehovah
[1:40:23] Witness all do that the Mysteries will
[1:40:26] be revealed in the last days when the
[1:40:29] seven angels seventh Angels message when
[1:40:33] he not when he starts out doing this but
[1:40:37] when he begins to sound his message
[1:40:40] see not the years in preparation but
[1:40:44] that when he begins to sound the message
[1:40:46] these Mysteries will be revealed and
[1:40:49] here they are not knowing them and your
[1:40:52] people are the witness of that
[1:40:55] so now he certainly lay that down as
[1:40:58] it will be later not just the beginning
[1:41:00] of his life works his faith expressed 65
[1:41:03] 11-26 and that brings to past because we
[1:41:06] have faith and I know this is of God
[1:41:08] is because this and other scriptures
[1:41:11] point to this hour
[1:41:12] Revelation 10 said in the hour of the
[1:41:15] seventh Angels message when he begins to
[1:41:17] sound forth his message not in a healing
[1:41:20] service but the message that follows the
[1:41:23] healing service
[1:41:25] Now where's your place in that
[1:41:27] still works as Fresh Express that was
[1:41:29] paragraph 293 this is paragraph 303. he
[1:41:33] knowed the word that would finally catch
[1:41:34] up with them
[1:41:35] he knows there come a time when the word
[1:41:37] would manifest itself and they couldn't
[1:41:39] go no further see that's where you your
[1:41:42] impersonators are left out because they
[1:41:44] can't go with the word right
[1:41:46] so have I know this all these years see
[1:41:49] that's right that the time would come
[1:41:52] when any miracle that God sins a real
[1:41:55] miracle there's always a change in the
[1:41:57] whole system if God sends something into
[1:42:00] the church and the old system's not
[1:42:03] changed he sent it in vain when a
[1:42:06] message Goes Forth in signs and wonders
[1:42:07] there is a message follows that when
[1:42:10] Jesus went forth healing then come his
[1:42:12] message what would I my father won right
[1:42:15] paragraph 151 Rapture message 65 1204.
[1:42:20] when I went forth into meetings with you
[1:42:22] praying for the sick it was fine but
[1:42:24] when I come with a message
[1:42:26] if any message goes forward if it's a
[1:42:29] true message if it's a true message
[1:42:30] genuine miracles of god and hangs right
[1:42:33] into that organization you know it's not
[1:42:36] of God because that thing's already
[1:42:38] declared right look at that already
[1:42:41] declared yep if it did happen the
[1:42:45] Baptist had their day of healing
[1:42:47] right right but that's done been
[1:42:49] declared
[1:42:51] see this is a different time right that
[1:42:53] Jesus went forth and healed the sick in
[1:42:56] order to catch the eyes of the people
[1:42:57] then his message that's right
[1:42:59] it has to have something that God's
[1:43:01] going to introduce he's just Divine
[1:43:03] Healing his miracles like that just
[1:43:05] catch the eyes of the people the main
[1:43:07] heart of it is the message there's what
[1:43:10] it's what what comes from in here he's
[1:43:14] trying to get into favor of the people
[1:43:16] so that they'll list sit and listen to
[1:43:18] him see and there's some more in there
[1:43:20] that's ordained to life trying to do God
[1:43:22] of service without his will 1965 1127
[1:43:25] the beat part he's talking about Janice
[1:43:28] and jambers which stood Moses so will
[1:43:30] these in the last day see the same thing
[1:43:32] come right along impersonating it just
[1:43:35] exactly see be careful watch the
[1:43:37] doctrine of the Bible watch the message
[1:43:40] that follows them signs till the same
[1:43:42] old school of message forget it God sent
[1:43:46] Miracles and signs to attract the
[1:43:48] attention of the people when Jesus come
[1:43:50] just Healing The Sick and so forth
[1:43:52] showed it to profits and they thought Oh
[1:43:54] Glory he's coming
[1:44:01] wrapped your message paragraph 156 65
[1:44:03] 120 forward
[1:44:05] in my message all the time knowing back
[1:44:08] there under healing and so forth like
[1:44:10] that just to catch the people's
[1:44:12] attention knowing the message would come
[1:44:14] and here it is now did I make that
[1:44:16] statement want to go
[1:44:17] all right
[1:44:19] you knew
[1:44:21] and them Seven Seals opened those
[1:44:24] Mysteries and showed those things is
[1:44:26] what happened I didn't know it but
[1:44:28] there's men standing right here and it
[1:44:30] was there and you heard the message
[1:44:31] first what time it I have heard but now
[1:44:33] I see 1965 11 27 evening service
[1:44:36] then he promised in the hour of the
[1:44:39] seventh Angels message the Seven Seals
[1:44:41] would be revealed and the mysteries of
[1:44:43] God would be declared Revelation 10 when
[1:44:45] the seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:44:47] message not the healing service the
[1:44:50] message that follows the healing service
[1:44:53] Rapture paragraph 107 65 1204.
[1:44:59] and here also at top of the seven Church
[1:45:01] Ages which in Revelation 10 7 that great
[1:45:04] mystery the book was to be unfolded by
[1:45:07] the seventh Angels message now there's a

[1:47:32] it all to me
[1:47:35] it's all right that's what you've been
[1:47:39] taught
[1:47:41] I read something one day or heard the
[1:47:43] prophet say it and it really has stuck
[1:47:44] with me
[1:47:47] he said remember
[1:47:50] that's what they've been taught
[1:47:56] stuff like that
[1:47:58] that's what you've been told exactly
[1:48:00] right you and I have been taught all of
[1:48:03] our life certain things exactly like

[1:48:07] to change isn't it hard to lay down
[1:48:10] showing her thank you right that's what
[1:48:13] gets me about the people and some of you
[1:48:14] even here say well boy when I first saw
[1:48:16] it man I sit right there and I'm back
[1:48:19] thinking it took me about eight months
[1:48:22] or six months or maybe 12 months to get
[1:48:23] you baptized
[1:48:32] amen
[1:48:38] that's why I said I'm sorry I'm I am I'm
[1:48:41] sorry
[1:48:42] that I can remember
[1:48:44] I wish I could forget
[1:48:48] you see I come through that too
[1:48:50] all right all right all right I studied
[1:48:53] this message from 66 until 67 before I
[1:48:56] left the Baptist Church
[1:48:59] he was in 67 right now I got baptized
[1:49:06] it took me a year
[1:49:10] just to get baptized
[1:49:17] and God sent you heard me tell it God
[1:49:19] sent an old Baptist preacher by one day
[1:49:21] or was having a Revival or something I
[1:49:23] had a distant preacher and he preached
[1:49:25] all you do in word indeed I do all in
[1:49:28] the name of Jesus Christ and the whole
[1:49:30] church started if you ever been in the
[1:49:32] Baptist you'd know come on you did you
[1:49:34] ever been in the Baptist or church or
[1:49:35] anywhere you say for God's sake my
[1:49:38] daddy-law used to call him the good
[1:49:39] Master you know they had names like that
[1:49:42] for the Lord's sake or what didn't they
[1:49:44] pray
[1:49:46] but all at once that whole church
[1:49:47] started praying in the name of Jesus
[1:49:49] Christ
[1:49:50] I said turn to look at that old preacher
[1:49:52] and I thought God thank you for sending
[1:49:54] that God bye
[1:49:56] the next day I told Brother mode I said
[1:49:58] when we're going to the water
[1:50:02] I settled it
[1:50:04] see all you do in word indeed right
[1:50:12] see then it was something that to wet I
[1:50:15] came to an understanding
[1:50:17] but there was no other way
[1:50:22] you said well what kept you so long one
[1:50:24] thing Pride
[1:50:28] more dying deacon at 23 years old
[1:50:31] teaching when I left I was teaching the
[1:50:33] adult Sunday school class which was the
[1:50:35] deacons and elders and their wives
[1:50:38] and teaching the training Union I was
[1:50:40] training Union director and Sunday
[1:50:41] school superintendent and all these
[1:50:42] different things at the same time had
[1:50:44] about five or six jobs I had to resign
[1:50:46] from
[1:50:47] good Pride
[1:50:49] rather than hell Pride I ain't never had
[1:50:52] no Pride
[1:50:53] that's where you're proud right now
[1:50:55] right you missed it
[1:50:58] see I knew the day I was baptized in the
[1:51:00] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:03] that I was out of the Baptist Church
[1:51:07] because most of you don't know it
[1:51:10] because you've never been there
[1:51:12] you can go to from a Baptist to a
[1:51:14] Methodist or Baptist to a Catholic you
[1:51:16] can go do anything you want to and you
[1:51:17] don't have to get baptized
[1:51:19] but if you go from any church to a
[1:51:22] Baptist Church you're going to be
[1:51:23] baptized in that Baptist Church that's
[1:51:25] right that is the Baptist Doctrine and I
[1:51:29] knew that
[1:51:30] I knew the day I baptized in the name of
[1:51:32] the Lord Jesus Christ I was going to
[1:51:33] have to tell them and leave
[1:51:37] you go right now International
[1:51:41] you're going to be I don't care if
[1:51:43] you've been baptized 20 times
[1:51:45] and if you've been baptized
[1:51:51] you're going to be baptized in that
[1:51:53] church
[1:51:55] and the father son and I'll go if you
[1:51:56] don't believe that go find your Baptist
[1:51:58] preacher and ask if I come down and join
[1:52:00] your church today it won't be the first
[1:52:01] thing I have to do is to get baptized
[1:52:05] I've been baptized yeah but you're going
[1:52:08] to be baptized in the Baptist
[1:52:12] see I knew the day I was baptized that's
[1:52:14] the last day I could go
[1:52:17] that I'd end in my career
[1:52:23] at that time I've been 27.
[1:52:27] I had to leave
[1:52:30] did you see
[1:52:34] we think we understand
[1:52:36] and do it
[1:52:37] must name that's right do we understand
[1:52:42] all said to wit to understand
[1:52:46] it goes on later in the Corinthians and
[1:52:49] the other scriptures and explains a lot
[1:52:52] about the change
[1:52:54] of the body
[1:52:56] but he should be adoption that we need
[1:52:58] to understand is to wit the Redemption
[1:53:01] of the body
[1:53:02] then in the last days here come the
[1:53:04] prophet what was he doing preaching
[1:53:06] Redemption of the body right he preached
[1:53:09] it so long until I get to it this
[1:53:11] evening preached so long and he wound up
[1:53:13] preaching that the world would have to
[1:53:14] be redeemed
[1:53:16] now probably when he first started out
[1:53:18] preaching about Resurrection no Divine
[1:53:20] Healing no Resurrection he probably
[1:53:21] didn't see that the world would be
[1:53:23] redeemed
[1:53:25] but you read the future home that's why
[1:53:27] I've asked you to go over that message
[1:53:29] he said I've taught it from the
[1:53:31] beginning
[1:53:33] he said now we see the world has to go
[1:53:36] through the same stages
[1:53:40] of redemption
[1:53:42] I ain't gonna ask you to raise your hand
[1:53:44] but how many of you have read right the
[1:53:46] future home since I asked you to give
[1:53:48] you now about three weeks
