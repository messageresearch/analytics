========================================

okay all right come back then hello alright so now let's go to Genesis chapter 29 let's watch right here in the book of Genesis we're going to find out that the Bible speaks of one week equal seven years you say know that brother branham I was a rebel lecture was a revelation butthead come out the Bible like have come out the Bible you could just say okay one week equal seven years to make it Matt sure it made it match but let's go and let's look at let's just read chapter 29 verse 17 I always come with a star glyph start right at 17 now this is the story of who Jacob and Rachel and Liam remember Jacob loved Rachel but leah was the oldest sister right and and Laban which is the con artist of them all he wanted yet the father of Leah and Rachel he wanted Jacob to have Leah first so you're always supposed to have the first firstborn all right and the blessing goes on verse 17 so this is this is Rachel I mean this is jacob and Laban negotiating with each other verse 17 Leo was tenderized but Rachel was beautiful and well favored Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve the seven years got it seven years for Rachel die younger guard and Laban said it is better that I give her to me then I should give her to another man abide with me and Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed done to him just a few days man what a low end for that girl I seven years seven years Wow he saved herself and she did for seven years don't tell me we can came to I'll serve these seven years for Rachel ladies it is better Jacob surf seven years for Rachel and they seemed to him but a few days for the love he had to her and Jacob said unto Laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto her all right now watch he came to pass in even that took Leah his daughter and broader than him and he went in unto her hmm okay that's a little different story but we got to continue with the story I don't understand she must have been all wrapped up cuz Jacob couldn't see her see nothing but her body because he should figure out that wasn't who that was but you can't I'll this in but just to save time watch this cuz Laban he goes into labor and Laban gave unto his darling leone's Delta he's made for him to maintain fast in the morning behold it was live it must have been dark in the room was a man and he said I'd 11 what is this the dial that's done into me did not I serve with thee for Rachel hello how many years seven years he served seven years for Rachel now listen this is a beautiful time we're with hostile beguile me verse 26 and Laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the young before the first born look at verse 27 fulfill her week fulfill her week it was a week it was seven years so one here one week equals seven years according to the model all right but you got you got to keep going to little tell in verse 28 it will keep going fulfill her week and we will give me this also for services down so served me yet seven other years so he had to serve seven more years to get Rachel him to wait seven more years when they have Lilly and Jacob did so and fulfilled her week what seven other years full fifth gem fulfilled her week one week equals like in the Bible seven years then you just keep going up you keep going on and don't say much more about it but there is where that I believe that the angel of the Lord probably took brother branham ins holding said look because what he says in the damn said two weeks book if you'll read it he says I can prove by the Bible that one week equal seven years well that's exactly the only time it ever is in the Bible claimed that one week equals seven years alright so one week equal seven years so now as one week equal seven years then we can see how they brother battle put all this together and it wasn't just 70 weeks it was seventy times seven now we can control that with a bottle when jeeta how much is seventy times seven 490 all right 490 amen 490 jesus said how many they said the wanting towns we forgive jesus said seventy times seven that's how long it took for him to forgive Israel 7b five seven four nine years yeah that's important because we're going to prove that that from the time of the rebuilding to Jesus was 483 years everybody got that yeah how many more years as left hello right I mean I I mean it's just really simple but but don't say don't Lillian to me I wanted to be simple to eat ok so now you can take them back to the Bible number one and say look we know that seven weeks that one week equals seven years anybody got them one week equals seven years that's always going to be that way all right according to the Bible so now during all this time we see that Jacob and Leah Rachel we're all together which is another top all together so now let's go to Daniel 9 where we were last week and let's get I want to get this I want to get this as a basis of of what we're going to talk about because I don't want to be just brother ground preach down 70 weeks and that's the way it is I've always wanted to be able to understand it says si si means to understand I won't be able to see Daniel 70 weeks don't be able to understand it I want to be able to know that I take it back to the Bible and not just type of quote because you know if you go over here so well we're not supposed to eat the flesh of men right I will tell us not to drink the blood of anything alive this look to ask the spirit in it right we're not to eat anything man we're not to eat each other right wait a minute the Bible says Jesus Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood did he break scripture he can he was this good but you got to explain what he's that you've got to watch see or understand what Jesus is talking about same thing with dang 72 inch you're going to be able to you know you weren't able by the end of this thing hopefully to be able to explain it step by step because remember one week equals seven years that's constant so remember the I will says one week equal seven years before even Jeremiah came about so it's in the Bible it's not just because you read her brother brown suit one week equals seven years you said well that's just what the Prophet says that's what they're saying lotsa fun Thomas with no viable thing about he was remember he was a word prophet he wasn't a false prophet he was a word prophet so whatever he got he got from the word alright so now let's listen to Daniel's prayer don't you though and don't you two get into this right here now what we're going to do is is next week we're going to take the first section which is what the seven first the seven years which is 49 here seven first seven weeks remember there's a three advice to keep reading that do you read daniel 9 24 to live until you can't almost recited extreme periods 762 and seven no 762 and 162 and seven is 69 they've one week left all right all right so you got a seven-week 62 and a one-week our one week equal seven years all right so there's seven years left after the rapture according to the Bible so brother Brian can't say anything different to that all right see that explains my brother branham if you got your chart this is the chart he drew and like I said before if anybody online wants to look at it again the clicks on here this chart according to brother George Smith and this chart according to brother George Smith they're right on top of that thing this chart according to George Smith is walk from Becca drew on the tabernacle chalkboard and did it again and put it on a piece of paper and I call this up and this is this is one of the this is not the original copy but it is a chart of Daniel seventy weeks as drawn by brother William Brown if I got that this is what he grew on the on the blackboard at church now there's another one and it's up let me see that behind that anything yeah let me see this one now people say well we don't know if that's true or not we're Bridal brother Jordan Smith said Rebecca doesn't want it done and approve and prove that she's the one that did this chart exactly the way brother round preached it alright so a few weeks later there was a brother this is come this comes from brother Homer Brown from Jacksonville Florida older brother San Augustine Florida he's an older brothers in his eighties but either he or one of his associates asked brother branham two weeks later to draw the chart again and explain it to him a restaurant so this his wife was drawn by brother branham himself all right this is brother Browns handwriting this is what he drew drew my brother William Brown for a brother that was at a restaurant with brother branham in 1961 he grew the exact same chart okay don't look exactly the same but it's the same chart all right so this is the confirmation to me that I mean you want to sing the people in the ministers meetings trying to draw their own charts well I think I think I'll stick with the one that brother branham drifted right and then try to understand it according to what we drink I try to produce my own idea and then draw a chart did that coincides with that so and surprisingly when we did the Dana 70 week series there was many many many many many probably eighty percent of the ministers had never seen this chart we've been in this message 50 years and they hadn't even studied enough to see what brother round upset but now we're going to read this today and like I said before this is not a Salvation issue you said well I don't understand it unless be lost no no no no no you understand that a man died on the cross for you and he saved your soul okay now that is in the Daniel 70 weeks cuz he died I left okay he died right there okay he's riding riding right in the the part that he spoke to clay and we're in the part that was supposed to play there's the Gentiles remember 70 weeks an angle doesn't have anything to do with the gym huh she let ya there's a gap right there that's what I always say right here he come down took the part out from the Jews when i'm done and got me right and he's going around back to the jew churches that went back to the g1 right back to the dude all right if I have any question for that so far so far but he died at caroling to save your soul now the seventy weeks of Daniel the understanding of the seventy weeks of Daniel number one if brother branham preached it we ought to be able to understand because I don't think he preached anything that he that he went to his grave that we didn't need to know that we needed to know that he didn't tell us and explain to us now they're worse things he took to his grave with that was for him personally he said that right but it was not for the bride as a whole okay the but if he preached three series of of Daniel 70 week then it must be important like I said last Sunday it's not a Salvation issue doesn't mean you're lost if you don't understand it but it is a growth issue it's a growth issue you can't grow past if you have an idea in your mind and it's wrong according to the Bible I don't see how we make up change of the body with a wrong sure we're going to have human thoughts and ideas but but to come down to the basis of what the Bible teaches if we don't have that because remember Jesus come on earth he was the word that's right he couldn't come contrary he came exactly the way the word said you say well we can't sure we can contrary to the word but once the one that is the word comes in to us and we allow them yes we are saying it right and we allow them to work we're still free moral agents even though we're bride of Jesus Christ we're still free moral agent we still can say no don't go in that door or no I can't understand that well then you just shut yourself off there be no growth up the statue of a perfect man without getting deep because you know what you we can't take a body change with a question Jesus did not take a body change with a question he knew who he was and when you come out at grave he said all power and him another's been given unto me well that's the same thing you're not going to say I understand that first one but the second part is are you saying that those who do not understand this habit they're not they're saved but they have to go by the great that's great absolutely absolutely I do not believe you can take a body change with any error you can't or why Paul that pole I someone said about stacking perfect man Paul M sugar took a rapture according to just that chart where it says holy spirit but they didn't have that love the mystery under the seals is what changes our body okay time to loose ends together why do we need a prophet to give us back to the word man to guess and then the son of man we been to it for months the Son of Man ministry is different from the Son of God minister but it's not it's inclusive right it's inclusive it's not well we doing away with the son of god men know that son of God's what saved your soul the son of man the ones are going to change your body this outside man yes hey man because remember the Son of God stood in the son of man in a man named Jesus right so the fullness of the Godhead body was in him but now the same fullness is in you in a part don't call the ocean so the same ability so don't tell me that the same ability that you have one discount spoonful the ocean every element that's in that great big ocean is in that one spoonful that's the part what we're doing is is where Jesus told us that we were able with him yeah denied the Bible say we're hairs and join us join us this not this join their whatever he had we can have but why brother drown say Creed's dogmas ideas man's idea has eroded the effect of the word of God can't kill words I just make the effect of it well I don't believe that will not believe in that don't make it not true but Jesus official word and Jesus was the word and the people leave did then you gotta believe a man so why do you think brother I'm spent all this time preaching all these sermons so that we can sit here today and what heats this puzzle back together for ourselves and not how I mean we can have a beautiful picture but the cows in the top of the tree you can graphs we should be on the ground that's what brother Brandon was talking about we have many great ministers decreasing very well servants but they can't understand and seventy weeks well then their people can't understand damage they knew it so did I take a body change I don't think so that's how important that every major issue that brother branham brought he did not bring it just to fill in take space no did not bring it to fill in takes back he brought it to where God can reveal it to us if we have the same Jesus inside of us if Jesus could understand it that he's expecting us to understand that's why this is a wonderful time yet it's an awful time because all the words been brought forth but only a small group of people is going to really understand it to the change of the body so going by the grave is not a bad thing but as long as I'm alive and remain I'm not a part of that day Paul today without us you know come be made perfect so I want to say it it is long and i'm alive i'm gonna try to understand all i can man the book is open the book is open we can go get a sermon and read it if we want to write and we can study it or we can just say well i'll let brother let brother Dale are always playing to me you're going to have to do a little bit of studying yourself because you're going to have a few questions and you're going to say well did you mean this or do you mean that okay so you really got a really got to focus on we're not going to get to this again let's read I'm going to read this and you just follow along because I want to say this is the stage that we're going to set bring your books next Sundy really because we're going to go we're going to start through that one section that he's talking about okay now this is this is why this is daniel in the 68th year he's reading jeremiah and he's in his soul he's troubled lord there's two more years left what are we going to do how's it going to be done and what's going to happen all right in the first year of Darius the son of a source of the seat of the meats which was made king over the realm of the child in in the first year of his reign and I Daniel understood by book Jeremiah we understand my books the prophet of God cemented the number of years the number of the years where of the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of Israel and I set my face into the Lord God you seek by prayer and supplication with vast in sackcloth and ashes he was pretty sincere and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said Oh Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by the party from thy precepts and from thy judgment neither have we hearken unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our kings are Prince's our fathers to all the people of the land o Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but in to us confusion a face let's see that's what's happening today as at this day we brought it right up to date any as to this day to the men of Judah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem to all Israel that are near and far off through all the countries remember they're still scattered where the down that's driven them because of their trespasses have trespassed against they remember hands were scattered try brother branham solid when Israel started back to the homeland he said god only deals with Israel in their homeland well for all them years they were scattered but now they're back in their homeland Oh Lord to us belong is confusion of faith to our Kings to our practices to our fathers because we have sinned against thee to the Lord our God belongs mercy and forgiveness though we have rebelled against him neither have we obeyed the voice of our Lord to walk in his laws which he set before us by servants to profit yay all Israel have transgressed the law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God because we have sinned against him and he had confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us agreeable front of the whole heaven have not been done as have been done upon Jerusalem as it is written in the law of Moses all this evil has come upon its yet made we got our prayer before the Lord our God then we might turn for our iniquities and understand that true understand up through there for at the Lord watched upon the evil and brought it upon us for the Lord our God is righteous and all his works what you do it for we obeyed not his voice and now O Lord our God that has brought down people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand bringing them out under Moses and it's gotten the renowned as that this day we have sinned and we have done wickedly oh Lord according to all that righteousness I beseech thee let that anger and I fury be turned away from the city of Jerusalem because remember Jeremiah rig the same thing we just read a man to go about backsliding there's real going and not that see Jeremiah was written Daniels reading it just like that brother Brown said the day and stay two weeks but if you read he said you know we're reading the same thing that Daniel was reading same thing we're reading the same thing that Daniel was reading all right o Lord according to all the rotten estaba 60 left on hangar now fury be turned away from the city Jerusalem remember Israel has to have a city the promise that promise city all right so the city is going to help us honor 1970 week the only mountain because for our sins and from the iniquity of our fathers Jerusalem ins I people are becoming a reproach to all that are about us now therefore all our God hear the prayer of thy servant that his supplications in cause I face to shine upon that sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake remember there's no temple there's no temple during that time all right oh my oh my god and climb down here and here open thine eyes and behold our desolation and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for I righteousness but for thy great mercy mercy o Lord hear o Lord forgive Oh Lord Harkonnen do defer not for that own sake oh my god for thy City and my people are called by thy name he's reminding god of his promises and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin in the sin of my people Israel and presenting myself occasionally for the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my god so he's prepped for the people in city right yay mala was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel because what is gable gable is the announcement angel he's the Angel to Israel all right who might have seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation so in the evening time is where the understanding is going to come all right the evening sacrifice are what the evening time all right and he informed me and talk with me and said Oh Daniel I'm now come forth to give the skill and understanding at the beginning of my supplication the commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision all right and here's what it is seventy weeks are determined upon thy City and upon the holy city I wished you would write that down somewhere people city cheers Jerusalem that's two things that Daniel seventy weeks is gotta deal with but if you don't have seven years left after the rapture you can't build to see anybody they say no you got 1260 days to preach and the two prophets are killed and they go to heaven that's not all the Bible that's not to the sea the city's got to be built that something's going to happen to that city all right seventy weeks are determined upon thy people not and upon the holy city two things to do six teams to finish the transgression make an end of sin make reconciliation for iniquity now that's for the people that's their sin that's their what that's their justification sanctification to baptism of the Holy Ghost Rider all right bring in everlasting righteousness how can you do that in 1260 days when you're trying to preach Redemption to the people you can't do that so you got to have time left sail up the vision and prophecy bought in the people and anoint the most holy that can't happen in 1260 days that's going to happen after years was redeemed so there's got to be more times than three and a half years left after the rapture according to the Bible know therefore and understand or see that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah shall be seven weeks seven weeks 7 times 7 is 49 years we're going to show that next Sunday and threescore and two weeks watch three score 62 6 + 65 three times two three score three time to his 662 week show us the street shall be built again in the wall even in trouble it's time so one is seven and 62 and I'm in 69 not 70 not 69 had got 68 and had 69 and after three score 2 weeks after the look that sixty two week period in other words the Messiah is going to come and he'll be cut off but not for himself who's he called for he died for me and you didn't die for herself died for Israel all right and the people of the press that she'll come little p shall come and show destroy the city who was that kind of stir Roman general alright will show that layer and the sanctuary what do you do he killed the people and he destroyed the temple Rome has all the things that the Jews need then I'll bring you the mural that shows tieless coming back into own and he's got the menorah and all the other things in his and it's in stone they put it in stone I mean he was a great general he brought all that gold stuff back in the room so who's got all that the Romans do all right why do you think that she was going to make a government we were all they got their pieces of the temple all right and after three scoring two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not from cell and the people the prince will come to destroy the city in the sanctuary and the end there L shall be with the flood he killed him off and I look that's 69 weeks there's one more week left somewhere and he shall confirm who's that little age the Antichrist shall confirm the covenant with many for one week brother Graham said that can't be God because he breaks it God don't break a covenant okay so that he is the Antichrist shall confirm the covenant many for how long wait half a week one week one week equals okay and in the midst of the week after the 1260 days the prophetess bridge that's half missed his middle he shall cause the sacrifice and ablation decision for the overspreading of abominations needs to make a desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the discipline all right let's go lean it over and over and over one and read you real read it one day I go that's what it say yes just keep one thing in mind brother Ram cannot break his name is not about he said
