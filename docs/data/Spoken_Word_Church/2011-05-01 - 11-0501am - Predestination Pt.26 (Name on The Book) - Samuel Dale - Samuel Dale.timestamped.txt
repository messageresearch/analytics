[16:30] away from him so just remember all of
[16:32] these are sick we really had a good time

[17:20] be the second
[17:22] Saturday and so yeah be two weeks away
[17:27] and then the fellowship meeting so
[17:28] remember that it's hard to keep this
[17:30] month right because it falling on the on
[17:32] the first but just remember that and
[17:34] pray that the Lord would be with us I
[17:36] think I've covered all announcements
[17:37] anything
[17:38] else any announcements I need to make
[17:42] huh just don't blow your nose for me
[17:44] today and wipe your eyes cuz I got
[17:46] enough trouble doing my own so we'll
[17:48] just don't have to worry about it but
[17:50] just keep praying that the Lord would
[17:52] would guide each one we appreciate the
[17:54] Lord taking away all of the weather from
[17:56] this area and the people because that's
[17:58] what we prayed dark uh the other day
[18:00] when the storms were coming you know we
[18:02] just asked the Lord to move it away from
[18:04] us you say well you moved it to somebody
[18:06] else well I can't help that that's right
[18:10] I mean I'm not being nasty I can't help
[18:12] that if I ask him to move it away I just
[18:15] can't tell him where to send it you know
[18:18] you just have to to let that alone you
[18:20] know but so we did pray and that's the
[18:23] way it happened you know we didn't have
[18:25] any trouble cuz I was talking to Brother
[18:26] Richard I think it's 30 something people
[18:28] killed in Tennessee and right down 10 mi
[18:31] from them towards Jonesboro off going
[18:34] back to Greenville there that it went
[18:36] through there you know destroyed a lot
[18:38] of things but uh we thank God for all of
[18:41] his protection to take care of us amen
[18:44] you like turn in your scriptures turn
[18:45] when we've been reading in
[18:47] Ephesians 1 and then we'll go to
[18:50] Revelations 13 so we've had a good time
[18:53] you've had a rest from my style of
[18:56] preaching and my my you know
[19:00] uh talking real slow and being slow and
[19:03] I hope you've enjoyed these brothers
[19:04] coming in and and everything and all and
[19:07] we appreciate the five-fold ministry cuz
[19:09] I believe in it I don't believe in a
[19:12] onefold I believe in a five-fold
[19:14] Ministry I believe there was one Prophet
[19:16] come to bring the message but there's a
[19:18] five-fold Ministry to break that message
[19:20] down to the people and that's what what
[19:22] I depend upon okay Ephesians 1
[19:25] Revelations 13 father we thank you for
[19:27] your love and your grace unto us we
[19:29] thank you for the day and the hour that
[19:31] we're living thank you for all things
[19:33] Lord that you've given unto us and you
[19:35] give un to us freely and I pray that you
[19:38] would just Lord direct each one of us
[19:40] into the right understanding because
[19:42] that's what we desire cuz you said with
[19:45] the restoration of the word would come
[19:46] restoration of power well we've had the
[19:49] word in written form is called the Bible
[19:52] in many years and then we've had now
[19:54] many years the the message or the hour
[19:57] that we called the the Spoken Word by
[19:59] the prophet but now we need it revealed
[20:02] unto each one of us because that to me
[20:04] is what I believe he's talking about
[20:07] with the restoration of the revealed
[20:08] word there's always to be power so we
[20:11] pray that you'd bless and guide each one
[20:13] now and just have your way in Jesus name
[20:17] amen amen Ephesians 1 we'll just read 3
[20:21] through
[20:22] 3-6 because we've been trying to read
[20:25] all of it now we're just taking
[20:26] basically uh parts of this that we've
[20:29] been reading on you know for a while and
[20:32] using it for the scriptural part says
[20:35] blessed be the God and father of our
[20:37] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[20:39] with all spiritual blessings work in
[20:41] Heavenly places in Christ now that's the
[20:44] main thing make sure you follow
[20:46] everything in Christ cuz it says
[20:49] according as he had chosen us were in
[20:53] him before the foundation of the world
[20:56] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[20:58] L before him in love now let's read it
[21:01] like
[21:02] this you know let's just turn your Bible
[21:05] you know just hit me turn your Bible to
[21:08] Revelations
[21:10] U 13 okay and let's read the scripture
[21:13] this way all right cuz I believe that's
[21:16] what it's saying I believe all that is
[21:18] the Bible okay you got it so let's read
[21:20] it this way verse four from Ephesians
[21:23] according as he had chosen Us in
[21:26] him before the foundation of the
[21:30] world that we should be holy and Without
[21:32] Blame before him in
[21:35] Love Now Revelations 138 all that dwell
[21:39] upon the Earth shall worship Him whose
[21:41] names are not written in the Book of
[21:44] Life of the lamb slain from the
[21:47] foundation of the world all right so you
[21:50] see we're getting it all together now
[21:52] back to verse 5 in
[21:53] Ephesians having predestinated us unto
[21:57] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[21:59] to himself according to the good
[22:01] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[22:03] the glory of his grace wherein Heath
[22:05] made us accepted in the Beloved amen you
[22:09] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[22:12] to the reading of the
[22:17] word because that's what we're we're
[22:19] going to be dealing with is when we get
[22:21] to it in a little
[22:24] bit is to try to talk about you know how
[22:28] they were chosen in him and uh but I
[22:31] want to make sure now I preached a
[22:33] message and I know it's been about that
[22:37] was week ago this past Wednesday that I
[22:40] preached a message on
[22:43] inheritance and I want to make sure
[22:45] that's
[22:47] understood I was going to continue on
[22:50] into uh the message like picking up this
[22:53] evening and then going on from there but
[22:56] it it just keeps bearing on me to make
[22:58] sure that we
[23:00] understand this about the
[23:03] inheritance and you know what it is and
[23:07] we covered as I said a whole message on
[23:09] it now so some of this will be repeats
[23:12] some of it will be added quotes from the
[23:14] prophet and things but I want us to
[23:20] understand the The Inheritance that
[23:22] we're talking about is eternal life
[23:26] right and the scripture says it comes
[23:28] through Jesus Christ right all right now
[23:33] but yet the prophet would
[23:36] say that Jesus never left you an
[23:41] inheritance all right so now if that's
[23:44] not
[23:46] understood there's not much need of
[23:48] going on to this evening's message where
[23:50] that we want to talk about uh the the
[23:55] predestinated uh you know and how that
[23:59] it takes place in doing that but tonight
[24:02] I mean the title today is
[24:07] predestinated all
[24:10] right name on the
[24:15] book predestinated and then put in
[24:18] parentheses name on the book this is
[24:20] message number 26 I think according to
[24:23] my numbers of
[24:25] predestination but see I want us to
[24:29] understand how that we receive an
[24:31] inheritance and what that inheritance is
[24:34] all right now there's only one
[24:36] inheritance I want that's right I don't
[24:40] care about the world it's falling apart
[24:44] I don't care about all these other
[24:45] things we're here we live we do what we
[24:48] can while we're here we enjoy the things
[24:52] of life and all of that while we're here
[24:54] in the world and all of that's well and
[24:57] good and there's nothing wrong with
[24:58] being rich and you know nothing wrong
[25:01] with being poor unless you're trying
[25:03] your best to be
[25:04] poor you
[25:06] know I just mean it like I say it that's
[25:10] the way to go with it but I don't care
[25:12] about this
[25:14] existence we're happy here I love to be
[25:16] in America at least we do until this
[25:19] time how the freedom and things that
[25:21] others doesn't have but if I inherited
[25:24] all of America had it at my feet what
[25:26] good would it do me because 71 I
[25:30] couldn't last very much longer sister
[25:32] Trudy was talking about something there
[25:34] you know of Finance in a home and 73
[25:38] years old and then finan a home for for
[25:41] uh 30 years she said I sure hope the
[25:43] Lord comes well I do it too because
[25:45] we're going to all be in bad shape but
[25:48] anyhow you know just a little fun out of
[25:51] it I get a tickled at us around here
[25:53] sometimes you know brother dick was
[25:55] saying there while ago and he didn't
[25:56] even notice and he said so the lost his
[25:58] job praise the
[26:01] Lord he was we get it all but Brother
[26:05] Richard won said a lot of times he said
[26:07] everybody going to die and go to hell
[26:08] said praise the
[26:10] Lord you know it doesn't mean it wrong
[26:13] folks out there we just we just you know
[26:17] we just say what we mean and forget the
[26:19] rest of it but now
[26:21] listen see what kind of inheritance
[26:25] would we
[26:26] want see I want eternal
[26:29] life right that's the only inheritance
[26:32] that I care about is eternal life and
[26:36] like I've always said once you get
[26:39] it it's the one thing that you'll try
[26:42] your best to give
[26:43] away is eternal life I mean you'll just
[26:47] try your best to give it to everybody
[26:49] else cuz you so want them to have it and
[26:52] that's why to me I believe Paul was
[26:54] saying it the way he meant it I believe
[26:55] that's what he meant when he said that
[26:57] I'd even and be a cast away right in
[27:00] other words i' give my eternal life to
[27:02] my people to save them I believe he
[27:06] meant that I don't think he was just you
[27:08] know hyp Hazard running his words I
[27:11] believe he meant it that he'd be willing
[27:13] to give it up if you could give it to
[27:15] somebody else cuz see that's when you
[27:17] get eternal life you got to remember
[27:19] somebody did have to give it up right
[27:21] for us to have it all right now that's
[27:23] what we want to talk about today but I
[27:25] want to make sure you as I said that you
[27:27] understand
[27:29] what I'm saying and what brother random
[27:31] is saying to to under you know to follow
[27:34] the the the line
[27:37] up and and to
[27:41] see what kind of an inheritance is I
[27:43] said do you
[27:46] want well if it's eternal
[27:49] life yeah and eternal life could never
[27:52] have a
[27:53] beginning or never have an ending but I
[27:57] don't agree with the people of the
[27:58] message you know that and they're
[28:00] quoting brother randam and that's all
[28:01] right but you take a quote by itself and
[28:03] it'll kill you and but they're saying
[28:06] well always was eternal well I agree
[28:08] with that if you have eternal life in
[28:11] the same message see if you have eternal
[28:14] life the eternal life you have always
[28:17] was eternal but there was a time you
[28:19] didn't have eternal life right all right
[28:23] and you had to receive eternal life by
[28:25] Jesus Christ if not then he died in vain
[28:27] and all this is just a you know
[28:29] halfhazard thing I'll get to it in a
[28:31] minute and repeat it again even God
[28:34] could not bring eternal life and just
[28:37] broadcast it over a world of
[28:39] people and it just fall on certain ones
[28:44] you know and as we think he couldn't
[28:46] even do that right man
[28:50] see he had to make a way that's right
[28:53] for us to receive that inheritance cuz
[28:56] that's what I want to talk about see I
[28:57] just want to make sure you understand me
[29:00] and you know and forgive me if I just
[29:02] repeat myself a lot but you know I I
[29:05] believe we need it but look at look at
[29:07] the notes I gave
[29:08] you off of the uh message adoption
[29:13] preached in 1960 and 522 the morning
[29:16] service and and listen to what your
[29:19] Prophet
[29:20] said right now you remember the number
[29:22] one in the line mean it's the
[29:23] continuation of reading I don't care if
[29:25] the paragraph changes a lot you just
[29:28] read on down it'll be the same I make
[29:30] sure that right oh brother Neville
[29:33] forgive me for taking this time that
[29:35] word inheritance oh God I know you it's
[29:38] My Kinsman brother I don't I hope I'm
[29:42] not crazy I I just I don't think I am
[29:46] now to somebody on the Internet or
[29:48] something I'm reading exactly the way
[29:49] that he does and I try to do that and I
[29:51] know I misread a lot but forgive me go
[29:53] back to the
[29:54] quote but oh my a what an
[29:59] inheritance we have obtained an
[30:01] inheritance somebody has to leave you
[30:06] something God before the foundation of
[30:08] the world left you
[30:12] something want you amen a name written
[30:17] on the book amen that when the lamb
[30:20] would be slain you'd be recognized with
[30:22] it right now listen which came first now
[30:26] I know this is a hypothetic iCal point
[30:28] of what I'm making but still get to
[30:30] Point the book was written and then the
[30:32] lamb was slain right it wasn't the lamb
[30:35] was slain and then the book was
[30:38] written the will was written first the
[30:41] book which is the Bible all right so
[30:44] come on down it comes to the Bible all
[30:47] right see it's not just a book it's a
[30:49] book of names the Bible is a book of
[30:51] names all right and and see then when
[30:54] you get over into the seals and things
[30:56] you get into the book being t
[30:59] and all and and and you know just
[31:00] remember the whole thing is talking
[31:02] about the
[31:04] Bible now it's not talking about uh all
[31:07] of these
[31:09] versions that's why we believe and go
[31:11] with and stay with what we can of what
[31:14] is known as the King James version
[31:17] because that was the one the prophet
[31:19] used now he read other translations I do
[31:22] too I check out things compare them and
[31:25] all and that's well and good but we go
[31:27] go by the King James version because now
[31:29] I'm going to say it the best way I know
[31:30] how to say it brother random didn't read
[31:33] a modern you know good news for Modern
[31:36] Man and then God come behind him and
[31:38] back it up but he read the King James
[31:41] verse and God come right behind and
[31:42] backed it up now he said that the ends
[31:44] and butts is in the right place right
[31:47] all right then you turn around and say
[31:49] now this word here should have been
[31:51] translated to this that's fine cuz he's
[31:53] not changing it see he's just giving you
[31:57] a better understand standing and that's
[31:59] what all these other versions can do if
[32:01] you keep it correct now you can believe
[32:03] what you want to but I believe now the
[32:05] King James version not the modern King
[32:08] James version where they take out edit
[32:10] do a little bit of things and you can't
[32:12] even find scull fields and stuff like
[32:14] that in the 1611 you might as well
[32:16] forget it go ahead and try it you can't
[32:18] get it CU you might find somebody that
[32:20] had an old Bible somewh way back but as
[32:22] far as I know Scofield have never even
[32:24] put out 1611 right all right right I
[32:27] have the 1611 there's very little
[32:29] difference between it and the old uh I
[32:32] like the 19 and what it 9 or 19 one6 or
[32:36] something and basically we use the
[32:39] 1917 all right because that's but
[32:41] they're all listed King James versions
[32:44] you know but what I'm getting at is I
[32:46] believe the original word is what was
[32:48] written in heaven right amen and I
[32:50] believe we have the word correct amen
[32:53] I'm not looking for other translations
[32:55] to change the meaning of these I'm
[32:57] looking to God to reveal all right now
[33:00] because if it's not revealed what good
[33:02] is any translation or all the
[33:04] translations righten you remember the
[33:06] man said we we can only understand it to
[33:08] brother random which was a good Baptist
[33:11] we can only understand it when we get
[33:12] everything in the perfect order he said
[33:15] well there was arguing over one mark in
[33:17] a word there you know in the original
[33:20] back there in 3:25 and is they got it
[33:22] all messed up using the King James
[33:25] version you know see but it wasn't 1611
[33:28] till later so come on you get what I'm
[33:30] talking about all the Bible was put
[33:32] together come down to to be the best all
[33:35] right now but see he left you something
[33:39] a name written on the book when the lamb
[33:42] would be slain you'd be recognized with
[33:45] it so now we'll get to it in a minute
[33:47] and read it on down in in the message
[33:50] which came
[33:52] first the
[33:55] inheritance are say the inheritors
[33:59] right right you know the people who had
[34:02] received it naturally they was doing all
[34:05] right then it was a will written
[34:06] out so we go down to court and we going
[34:09] to leave our family this that or the
[34:11] other we write out a
[34:13] wheel all right
[34:15] technically you wait until death to give
[34:19] the inheritance but you can go down and
[34:21] give it you can write a will and say I
[34:24] want to divide up all of this which is
[34:27] the most sful way right but people don't
[34:30] care about that part but it's better to
[34:31] give your kids and families and all your
[34:33] money now than it is to let the
[34:34] government E you do you know I mean I'm
[34:37] just playing so you know but that's all
[34:40] right you do what you want to with your
[34:41] money cuz I ain't concerned about it
[34:43] except you pay you TI right and I don't
[34:45] give a hoot where you do that or not cuz
[34:47] that's between you and God cuz this
[34:49] church has never operated off of begging
[34:51] for anything right amen I'll give it to
[34:53] you instead you give it to me that's
[34:55] that's never been anything else I get in
[34:56] trouble with people trying to explain
[34:58] that but I sure have seen God vindicate
[35:01] so I don't worry about it I do whatever
[35:02] I'm led to do myself all right but now
[35:08] listen the prophet said then your
[35:12] inheritance was your
[35:14] name written
[35:16] in and he'll call it Book of Life and
[35:19] then he'll call it Lamb's Book of Life
[35:20] now we know the difference right we know
[35:22] that the book of life there are sections
[35:25] of the Book of Life there sections that
[35:27] where the foolish virgins are dealt with
[35:29] in the book of life but there's also a
[35:31] place called an eternal section of the
[35:34] book of life that is dealing only with
[35:36] the bride all right and that way see the
[35:39] whole Plan of Redemption is there it's
[35:41] not that that it's all written to us it
[35:45] is but yet there's other people get the
[35:48] benefits from it to receive eternal life
[35:50] at later dates and things all right and
[35:52] their name is in the book all right so
[35:55] all names were written in the Book of
[35:57] Life before the foundation of the world
[35:59] Amen now Judas could be rised out cu the
[36:02] Book of Life your name can be taken out
[36:04] but now if it's in the Eternal section
[36:06] it cannot be so we're talking about the
[36:08] bride and the Lamb's Book of Life The
[36:11] Eternal section okay amen all right you
[36:15] understand what I'm talking about that's
[36:16] what we're dealing with on what we're
[36:18] talking about cuz he left you something
[36:20] a name written on the book amen all
[36:24] right now the Bible said he' deceive
[36:26] everybody except who's names were
[36:28] written so it's going to deceive those
[36:30] that's got their names in the
[36:32] book but it's not going to deceive those
[36:35] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[36:37] Book of Life The Eternal right amen all
[36:42] all of it's the book all right so watch
[36:43] what he
[36:46] says Okay jump down to the next
[36:49] paragraph what how do you get this
[36:54] inheritance how did we get it because
[36:57] walked up
[36:58] right how do you get this
[37:01] inheritance because we were
[37:03] predestinated
[37:06] am now we've been so far on doing it how
[37:10] does God predestinate by his for
[37:13] knowledge so for knowledge preceded his
[37:17] predestination and he knows but there is
[37:20] a
[37:22] bride that's
[37:23] predestinated right all right and we'll
[37:26] get to that more this afternoon what he
[37:28] said we my Armenian Brothers I know this
[37:31] really that's awfully hard I don't mean
[37:34] to hurt but it just does me so good to
[37:37] know it you read all the rest in between
[37:39] look on down an inheritance now watch oh
[37:42] my be in what kind being what kind of an
[37:46] inheritance being
[37:49] predestinated according to the
[37:52] purpose of him who worketh all things
[37:56] after the counsel of his own
[37:58] will all right so now he could
[38:01] predestinate a
[38:04] bride to be conformed to His
[38:07] Image sure we have a part to do with it
[38:10] because we must receive eternal life as
[38:12] I said it's not a blanket thing throw it
[38:15] out we must receive
[38:17] it God could not just before the world
[38:20] just sprinkle it down and just every who
[38:22] reaches up somewhere and grabs it no but
[38:26] it's according to his will
[38:29] cuz his will is his word all right now
[38:31] we get to it this evening what is it not
[38:33] the person that comes predestinated
[38:34] eternally but the word are seed that's
[38:38] right okay now so what are we going to
[38:42] listen to what he
[38:44] says when he before he was
[38:48] Papa before he was
[38:50] God before he was a
[38:53] savior before he was a Healer before all
[38:58] this he
[39:02] predestinated put the Lamb's name on the
[39:06] book now what look down through by his
[39:10] for knowledge that's right and seeing
[39:13] your name put seeing your name put it on
[39:16] there too what is it and after a while
[39:19] we come in the world born by sinful
[39:22] parents we walk around on the world you
[39:25] know first thing you know like that
[39:27] Little Hook noos Jew Paul you know and
[39:30] and he was carrying out now you know
[39:32] what Paul was doing and the first thing
[39:34] something said here here here
[39:37] here now we know what happened to Paul
[39:40] don't we right see God contacted him
[39:43] amen all right now watch you say they
[39:47] bring it on down with us oh AB a father
[39:51] here we begin to come see predestinated
[39:54] us to our inheritance in him
[39:59] there is no predestination of any
[40:01] inheritance unless it comes through
[40:02] Jesus Christ amen now we got to get that
[40:04] right because he never died to leave us
[40:06] an
[40:07] inheritance all right so we'll get to
[40:09] that in a minute
[40:10] now which predestinated us to our
[40:14] inheritance in him which was
[40:16] predestinated to us we we inherited it
[40:20] before the foundation of the
[40:23] world see oh for this his own purpose to
[40:26] work out his own good will that's
[40:29] exactly to be a God and savior amen now
[40:33] here's what basically people say see oh
[40:37] I always was
[40:39] eternal what was the purpose of Jesus
[40:41] Christ ever coming into the world and
[40:43] coming down the way if you always was
[40:46] eternal right now the eternal life you
[40:49] receive today always was eternal because
[40:52] there not but one form of eternal life
[40:55] so you get it like that and you're
[40:57] getting into these
[40:59] doctrines that's right of mankind of the
[41:01] message that believes this but see this
[41:03] ain't going to change none of them
[41:06] right I'm talking to you to make sure
[41:08] you don't get fallen into a trap right I
[41:11] preach to you not those out there has to
[41:13] listen and somebody else is their Pastor
[41:16] right if they want to hear it those on
[41:17] the internet that's
[41:19] fine but just go back and check it see
[41:22] you said but my pastor believes so and
[41:24] so
[41:26] well but said your pastor's ordained to
[41:28] lead you through so you better find it
[41:31] but he said if your pastor gets off the
[41:33] word get off away from your pastor now
[41:36] that's his words but you you don't want
[41:38] to hear that oh it's too far to travel
[41:40] it's too much to do I've been here with
[41:42] these wonderful people for a long time
[41:44] well if them wonderful people's going to
[41:46] hell evidently you going with them right
[41:48] you know that's
[41:50] pling why play right amen you know they
[41:54] don't play with me right so why play all
[41:57] right well
[41:58] look he said we
[42:01] inherited The Inheritance before the
[42:04] foundation of the world that's right
[42:06] right now we'll read in a minute I think
[42:08] it's in the next one where he says your
[42:10] inheritance was first all right that's
[42:14] right if if your inheritance is eternal
[42:17] life your eternal life was first right
[42:21] now when he's saying before he was God
[42:24] before he was Papa before he was a
[42:26] savior he's not talking about that he
[42:28] didn't have those attributes in him he's
[42:30] talking about before he displayed them
[42:34] anywhere right then he always had
[42:38] that see so if my inheritance is eternal
[42:42] life then the eternal life that I
[42:44] received by the new birth always was
[42:47] eternal
[42:49] right cuz it's his own life now we'll
[42:52] get to that in a minute or this
[42:53] afternoon's message how did you get in
[42:55] the body of Christ
[43:00] am you answer the
[43:02] question right now let's go on and
[43:04] reading those were paragraph 170 through
[43:07] 172 then we jump over to paragraph 177
[43:10] and the sign message inheritance by
[43:14] predestination I inherited something
[43:17] what inheritance they had to be somebody
[43:19] to leave me an
[43:22] inheritance now we're getting on to the
[43:25] understanding see that Jesus Jesus never
[43:27] died to give you an inheritance right he
[43:30] died to bring you to your
[43:32] inheritance in the natural it's it's
[43:36] generally that somebody dies then they
[43:37] bring out the whe they read it or
[43:39] something like that then you give you
[43:42] inheritance but now we'll get to it in a
[43:44] minute I got it wrote down here I agree
[43:45] wholeheartedly God can't die God in
[43:48] spirit form can't die he had to do
[43:50] something else right all right we know
[43:52] that's
[43:53] true but watch what he says there had to
[43:56] be somebody leave you an inheritance why
[43:59] you say Jesus left you an
[44:01] inheritance he said beg your pardon
[44:04] Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus
[44:07] never left you an inheritance he only
[44:09] came down and
[44:11] paid for your inheritance brought you to
[44:16] your inheritance now that's what Jesus
[44:18] come to do to bring us to The
[44:21] Inheritance he's not just a reader of
[44:23] the
[44:24] will that's what you do you know you go
[44:27] in to don't make him just a reader of
[44:29] the will brother brandom would have been
[44:31] the reader of the will the prophets
[44:33] would be the readers of the will right
[44:37] right but see somebody had to get that
[44:40] set
[44:41] up all right to where that the reader of
[44:44] the will could do it a preacher say I
[44:46] can only read you the
[44:48] will I can't bring the will to you I
[44:52] can't make it manifest to you that's
[44:54] right I can only read that your
[44:56] inheritance is die that's a reader of
[44:58] the will so there's got to be somebody
[45:00] in between the reader of the will and
[45:03] the one who made the will
[45:05] right all right but see we always
[45:08] connect
[45:11] death right to a will being read all
[45:15] right now we're going to get to that
[45:16] that's what Jesus Christ
[45:18] done through his death but the
[45:21] inheritance was first that's right your
[45:24] name written in the book L's Book of
[45:26] Life
[45:27] right predestinated on
[45:31] there predestinated by his for knowledge
[45:34] that he knew you would accepted right
[45:36] right
[45:38] amen but his word is what come
[45:40] predestinated eternally so we'll get to
[45:42] that later
[45:44] watch see Jesus never left me an
[45:46] inheritance Jesus never left you an
[45:48] inheritance he only came down and paid
[45:50] for your inheritance brought you too y
[45:53] your inheritance but your name was put
[45:55] on the L Book of Life before the
[45:57] foundation of the world God give you
[46:00] your inheritance your inheritance was
[46:05] first
[46:07] right Jesus only come and here's what
[46:10] most people believe you know like a lot
[46:13] here's the way they try to make it God
[46:15] said well there's a lot of people lost I
[46:17] don't want
[46:18] them he said be saved so I'll send Jesus
[46:22] down and perhaps maybe he'll somebody
[46:24] feel sorry and know what I've done and
[46:26] get saved oh mercy I wouldn't run my
[46:28] office like that even as poor as I
[46:31] do right flip over this continual
[46:34] reading right on there God by his for
[46:37] knowledge seen exactly who would be
[46:39] saved and who wouldn't be
[46:40] saved He sent Jesus to save those that
[46:44] he had already
[46:46] chosen didn't Paul say five verses
[46:49] behind this did he chose us in him be
[46:52] before there even was a
[46:55] world that's our inheritance right God
[46:58] chose us and let Jesus come and pay the
[47:00] price the what his shedding of his blood
[47:04] that no sin would be counted unto us
[47:08] nothing you do then he goes on to
[47:09] explain if you sin willfully explains
[47:11] what that is he goes on down and says
[47:13] they never receive the truth they
[47:15] receive the knowledge of the truth right
[47:16] see you can receive a knowledge of the
[47:18] truth that don't set you free right
[47:20] knowledge of the truth don't save you
[47:22] that's right that's exactly what the
[47:25] children of Israel had amen that's what
[47:27] Nicodemus had Etc knowledge of the truth
[47:30] but he never had the truth revealed to
[47:32] him all right so now he goes to the
[47:34] evening
[47:36] service on adoption 5:22 the evening
[47:39] service number four of
[47:42] adoption now a little further now on
[47:45] that 11th verse in whom also we have
[47:47] obtained an inheritance an inheritance
[47:49] somebody has to leave you something to
[47:51] inherit it is that right an inheritance
[47:54] what inheritance do we have what what
[47:56] inheritance did I have I didn't have any
[48:00] but God left me an inheritance when he
[48:03] put my name on the L book of life before
[48:06] the foundation of the
[48:08] world oh you say now wait a minute
[48:10] brother Jesus did that when he died for
[48:13] you no he never Jesus come to purchase
[48:19] right that inheritance for me read the
[48:22] next verse and you very next line see
[48:25] read it
[48:28] in whom we also have
[48:30] obtained apparent which is in there goes
[48:33] back he said obtained an inheritance
[48:35] being predestinated according to the
[48:37] purpose of him who worketh all things
[48:40] after the counsel of his own will see
[48:42] Jesus never come to give you an
[48:46] inheritance that's right
[48:48] Amen in this line someone had to pay the
[48:52] price or a range
[48:55] away
[48:57] to deliver the
[48:59] will to the people right now I said a
[49:02] reader the Will's
[49:03] fine the lawyer reads you the will but
[49:06] he don't have what to give law give me
[49:08] my
[49:08] money he say right here I get $10,000 I
[49:11] want it right now laer just look at you
[49:14] say hey Budd you ain't dealing with me
[49:15] you got to go deal with these people
[49:17] over here these people over here is want
[49:19] to make the arrangement and they tell
[49:20] you where the banks at they tell you who
[49:22] to go see and they'll take care of it
[49:24] but I ain't giving you a dime I'm
[49:26] charging you
[49:29] yeah right see he's just a reader of the
[49:33] will but see there's got to be somebody
[49:36] that can transmit that wheel
[49:40] down right and to do that what would it
[49:47] take all right so you say well Jesus did
[49:51] that when he died for
[49:54] you no no he never Jesus has come to
[49:57] purchase that inheritance for me read
[50:01] the next verse he come to
[50:04] deliver to
[50:06] transmit to bring it down to you right
[50:10] right he came to be the party between
[50:13] the one that wrote the
[50:15] will and the
[50:17] one that would receive the inheritance
[50:21] he there has to be a way to be able to
[50:23] do that then so then what happened
[50:30] go on reading let's just read what he
[50:35] says just continue reading because I
[50:37] like to do that which paragraph 74 God
[50:40] before the foundation of the world as
[50:42] we've took it down through the lesson
[50:44] you people see you people how we seen
[50:47] God with
[50:49] self-existence how that in him was love
[50:51] and him was God was to to be God there
[50:54] was nothing to worship him and him was
[50:56] to to be father there
[50:58] was he was by himself in him was to be
[51:01] savior nothing lost in him was to be a
[51:03] Healer that's the attributes of him
[51:06] there was nothing there so his
[51:09] ownership his own Good Counsel produced
[51:12] these things that he might through this
[51:15] one man Christ Jesus gather it all
[51:18] together again or the eyes have not seen
[51:21] and all talking about the mysterious
[51:23] wonders so watch what he said keep on
[51:25] reading part 75 look has predestinated
[51:28] us unto this
[51:30] inheritance if I'm a right inheritance
[51:33] of something if God is knocking at my
[51:36] heart and saying William brandom I
[51:38] called you a long time ago before the
[51:40] foundation of the world to preach the
[51:41] gospel I have an inheritance an
[51:44] inheritance of eternal
[51:46] life now God sent Jesus to make that
[51:49] inheritance real to me that's right
[51:52] because there was nothing I could do to
[51:54] inherit it it was blank it was valid
[51:59] there's nothing I can do see he's
[52:02] explain what we can't do anything right
[52:04] not that the will is blank not at the
[52:06] thing it's all about what we could do
[52:08] but in the fullness of time God sent in
[52:10] his own good time Jesus the lamb slain
[52:14] from the foundation of the world his
[52:15] blood was shed that I might go to my
[52:19] inheritance to be what what inheritance
[52:22] to sunship to be a Son of God right all
[52:26] right amen now see then the will was
[52:30] written first
[52:32] y
[52:34] right the will the Bible
[52:38] Etc was written and in that Bible it
[52:41] explains that Jesus Christ stood as a
[52:43] lamb slain before the foundation
[52:46] War so Redemption I the people told me
[52:49] when I come into the message you know
[52:51] there in in' 67 and uh along in that
[52:55] area of time there was preaching that
[52:57] you couldn't be saved after 63 cuz
[53:00] Redemption was over when the seals broke
[53:03] you know you couldn't get saved at
[53:05] 63 I said well I'm sorry bless him but
[53:10] along about 69 I really did argue with
[53:12] them because I said and they were still
[53:14] saying that I said you can argue all you
[53:16] want to I've got the experience that's
[53:18] it right there I don't give a hoot what
[53:19] you think that's right you can say
[53:21] redemption was over I said according to
[53:23] my Bible right and the prophet I believe
[53:26] Redemption was over before the world
[53:28] ever begun right amen and that's what I
[53:30] read on the
[53:31] scripture Redemption was over before the
[53:34] world began
[53:37] right cuz he only come to save those
[53:40] that was redeemable am amen well it's no
[53:43] problem see it's just no see I'm might a
[53:45] smart etic because of those things but
[53:48] what's wrong with being a smart etic
[53:49] about the
[53:50] truth I'd rather be a smart EIC about
[53:53] the truth than a
[53:55] dummy I tried to use it not use that
[53:57] other word cuz Josiah got on to me about
[53:59] using stupid and I don't need to use
[54:01] that I use dummy josi now maybe
[54:05] help he said it didn't sound good so out
[54:08] of the mouth of a baby I guess you learn
[54:11] wisdom but now
[54:17] listen then Jesus
[54:20] Christ never gave me an inheritance
[54:25] right all right but then let me lay down
[54:29] a what is that big old word I like in
[54:30] this modern day language is I never do
[54:32] understand I'm have to look up the
[54:33] dictionary but let let's lay down what
[54:35] is that word to use scenario which mean
[54:38] let's just lay out something in front of
[54:39] you to look at you know well let's lay
[54:41] out
[54:43] something now Jesus could
[54:47] not give us an
[54:53] inheritance he come to bring us to it
[54:56] right Amen to pay the price to do the
[54:59] things we know
[55:00] that all right now let me say it this
[55:02] way where you'll
[55:03] understand there could never be an
[55:06] eternal inheritance coming from any
[55:08] flesh
[55:10] right number one right flesh can't give
[55:13] you an eternal
[55:16] inheritance our flesh is going to be
[55:18] redeemed it is already purchased taken
[55:20] care of Etc but one day it will be
[55:24] totally redeemed all right right no even
[55:27] Jesus's body had to be redeemed not that
[55:29] it was sinful because it had a beginning
[55:30] I got to quote in
[55:32] here but I'm laying down a good case in
[55:35] front of you to look at but it's also
[55:38] Jesus could not give you an inheritance
[55:43] right now follow my
[55:45] line but God could not give you that
[55:48] inheritance
[55:50] without it being done the way he done it
[55:52] right
[55:54] right cuz he cannot is I said to
[55:56] sprinkle eternal life and every who
[55:59] happens to be under the water as it
[56:01] falls you know or whatever you want to
[56:02] call it or some form you know all these
[56:04] great preachers they make it and you you
[56:06] just feel so good in your body and you
[56:08] just Oh Glory Hallelujah I happen to be
[56:10] under the spout but I'm sorry brother
[56:13] collie you wouldn't under the spout you
[56:15] say you got saved after 63 well I'm
[56:18] sorry one brother in this message I
[56:20] don't call his name but he preached that
[56:22] real strong you know that you couldn't
[56:24] be saved after 63 but it goes back back
[56:26] to this church and I'm not making it a
[56:28] comical I'm making it a truth he
[56:30] preached it in his church well that he
[56:32] went back the next year ever sister in
[56:34] the church was either pregnant and
[56:35] already had a
[56:37] baby now I'm not joking I know the
[56:41] story well what was he going to
[56:43] do he done preach the year before nobody
[56:46] could be saved after
[56:48] then so he made him a good Doctrine
[56:51] you're saved in your parents oh my well
[56:55] that might be all right cu the ones that
[56:56] was in the parents you know that's
[56:59] comical but those that been born out of
[57:02] That's Got of
[57:03] problem but you see people always got a
[57:06] away and everybody loves that you know
[57:09] brother said something to me one time
[57:11] this brother said something and he said
[57:13] well I can see that I said I can't cuz
[57:14] it ain't in the Bible that's it right
[57:17] there well I know I'm smart e it ugly
[57:20] and hateful but can't do much about ugly
[57:23] I guess I change hateful but but now
[57:28] listen so God cannot just sprinkle down
[57:32] eternal life
[57:33] no he made a way to receive eternal life
[57:37] right if you don't want it it's not for
[57:40] you right what do you mean always was
[57:45] eternal you mean you got it without the
[57:48] death of Jesus
[57:49] Christ so he died in vain
[57:53] right so you know what I feel about that
[57:55] that's garbage kids but you know that's
[57:57] the popularity of the message something
[58:00] to make you feel so
[58:05] wonderful I feel wonderful about the
[58:07] revealed word right and I'm not throwing
[58:11] off on nobody I love to hear people that
[58:14] rejoice and make me feel good but it
[58:17] don't make me feel good for somebody to
[58:18] come along say
[58:21] all a on the camera but stay here all
[58:24] left-handed people are ser see more
[58:27] people just Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah
[58:29] all ain't that a wonderful Revelation
[58:32] but you better believe you're not
[58:35] left-handed right right I mean you back
[58:39] on that y 80y old man said we don't
[58:42] believe in have in having babies anymore
[58:44] so he's 80 years old
[58:47] you he's
[58:49] doctrines that's right but people are
[58:52] sitting there today instead of listening
[58:54] to the truth right right oh we're ready
[58:57] for the Rapture we're ready for the
[59:00] Rapture yeah all right I just try to I
[59:04] try to make it comical when I'm getting
[59:05] serious about stuff cuz you'll remember
[59:08] it longer so with other people that hear
[59:10] is it you'll remember it for a longer
[59:12] time but now
[59:15] listen Jesus came to make a
[59:19] way that I could get my inheritance
[59:22] right yep that's right everybody agree
[59:24] with that amen I don't T you amen or
[59:26] heart or whatever just you agree with it
[59:28] Jesus came to make a way cuz it couldn't
[59:30] be done right without him making a way
[59:35] right or else all is in vain of the
[59:37] Bible and all the
[59:39] things God just it out just every who
[59:42] happened to fall at the F got it you
[59:44] know no he couldn't do it that way
[59:48] right he made a way if you don't receive
[59:51] eternal life God cannot override your
[59:55] free more AG
[59:56] and make you take it that's
[1:00:02] Catholic you can do what you want to
[1:00:04] with you say well what about Paul he
[1:00:06] didn't make him receive eternal
[1:00:08] life he just slapped him off the horse
[1:00:11] where he could talk to
[1:00:13] him
[1:00:15] right he had to receive eternal life yes
[1:00:18] sir amen all right now watch
[1:00:24] then then if Jesus come to pay the
[1:00:29] price see then what he was doing was
[1:00:32] making a
[1:00:35] way that God could transmit eternal
[1:00:38] life will you go with me yes now when
[1:00:42] know for certain we don't believe in two
[1:00:44] Gods three Gods
[1:00:47] Etc so as your Prophet said it was
[1:00:51] necessary we'll read this where it be on
[1:00:53] the
[1:00:54] table go God would not send a son would
[1:00:58] you send one of your sons if a debt had
[1:01:00] to be paid you
[1:01:02] know you know somebody going to die he
[1:01:05] okay take the kids leave me alone now
[1:01:09] what kind of a daddy is that garbage kin
[1:01:13] Daddy no God didn't do it that way and
[1:01:16] he wouldn't do it that way he didn't
[1:01:19] send another he came himself right well
[1:01:22] now you're one that no
[1:01:26] sorry about
[1:01:28] that true Oneness yes right because to
[1:01:32] me Jesus was either almighty God in
[1:01:35] human flesh which meant as the prophet
[1:01:38] said in body he was a man a creation
[1:01:41] spoken into existence for the purpose of
[1:01:45] dying to be the kinsman redeemer that in
[1:01:48] body he was a man that in Soul and
[1:01:51] Spirit he was almighty God right now
[1:01:53] that's not
[1:01:54] Oneness
[1:01:57] that is not Oneness Doctrine that's
[1:02:00] right and I go on to believe cuz Oneness
[1:02:02] is like your finger and that's they say
[1:02:05] that's the last form of God I differ
[1:02:06] with you because the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ is the last form of God right so
[1:02:11] I'm not that form of Oneness I believe
[1:02:13] I'm true Oneness
[1:02:15] amen but it would be necessary then that
[1:02:18] the person that would
[1:02:21] come could not be just a man as the
[1:02:24] River Jordan people are saying amen but
[1:02:28] would be the man not the first person
[1:02:32] second person or third person cuz if
[1:02:34] he's the first person that means there
[1:02:35] could be more brother brother said he is
[1:02:37] the person right that's right so it had
[1:02:40] to be almighty
[1:02:42] God the only
[1:02:44] way that your inheritance could come to
[1:02:47] you us would have to
[1:02:51] be that that
[1:02:53] inheritance would have to now listen
[1:02:56] what I'm
[1:02:57] saying that inheritance would have to
[1:03:00] come in a human vessel right yeah so the
[1:03:03] Bible said God's in Christ reconciled in
[1:03:05] the world and himself
[1:03:08] amen so it would mean my inheritance is
[1:03:11] not up in heaven
[1:03:15] right my inheritance came to Earth
[1:03:18] because I was chosen in him or I won't
[1:03:21] be
[1:03:21] chosen right so when Jesus Christ came
[1:03:25] to Earth that was God Almighty Emmanuel
[1:03:29] right God With Us
[1:03:31] right not just a man until the River
[1:03:34] Jordan and then he becomes God
[1:03:39] Amen
[1:03:42] no the Bible said he was born Lord to
[1:03:47] Christ if he become a man I mean if he
[1:03:50] was just a man body spirit and soul and
[1:03:52] then he become God then what have you
[1:03:54] got right amen you're worse than Oneness
[1:03:56] that's Tess a got no plain language or
[1:03:59] sense that's
[1:04:01] Tess and I'll read to you some things in
[1:04:04] here in a minute that the man wrote In
[1:04:05] the book himself and he turned around
[1:04:07] later and said I wish I hadn't wrote it
[1:04:08] that way why because it's contrary to
[1:04:10] his two Lords yeah because he believes
[1:04:13] in two persons yeah I wouldn't say that
[1:04:16] if I heard him he said Jesus was a
[1:04:18] person and God was a person that's right
[1:04:20] of course I know he's got a great
[1:04:21] following that's all right I know I have
[1:04:23] no arguments I'm not trying to get his
[1:04:25] following
[1:04:26] I don't want his following you know why
[1:04:28] it take me a long time to preach out of
[1:04:30] them the junk right that he's done to
[1:04:32] put in them that's right amen is that
[1:04:35] plain enough
[1:04:36] amen that's just the way I
[1:04:39] am see because I I put up with you a
[1:04:42] long time and I hope you put up with me
[1:04:43] a long time to maybe get out of all of
[1:04:45] us what they put in us before we got
[1:04:47] here I hope Brother D you think you're
[1:04:49] something no it's exactly what I am if
[1:04:52] it's a truth tell me if it ain't coming
[1:04:54] tell me right but you better bring the
[1:04:57] prophet's message don't come to me and
[1:04:58] say oh I don't believe
[1:05:01] you you better believe that he's going
[1:05:03] to be lay in front of you that's right I
[1:05:05] started that way I'll end that way first
[1:05:08] man come in this message said we ain't
[1:05:10] got the Holy Ghost I said read the book
[1:05:13] yeah right they called me to your
[1:05:15] Theologian I said read the book there at
[1:05:17] late he said the Holy Ghost come on
[1:05:19] theusa street was the same baptism of
[1:05:22] the Holy Ghost that come in the book of
[1:05:24] Acts
[1:05:26] he finally said what do you think's
[1:05:27] wrong I said I think a lot of people
[1:05:29] don't have the Holy Ghost I'll read in a
[1:05:31] minute where the Prophet says about the
[1:05:33] New
[1:05:34] Birth cuz if you don't have the new
[1:05:36] birth forget it
[1:05:38] right instead of elel Israel right right
[1:05:42] can be now
[1:05:44] watch let's just read a little bit now
[1:05:47] look at number four when you notes GES
[1:05:49] instructions Daniel 61730 paragraph 56
[1:05:53] now we find that he was our kinsman
[1:05:54] redeemer
[1:05:57] and he took the book out of the hand of
[1:05:59] the original
[1:06:01] owner and you know that's in Revelations
[1:06:04] 5 and going on over right to break the
[1:06:06] seals okay it is a title deed to
[1:06:10] Redemption we found that you remember
[1:06:12] that study the study it's a title deed
[1:06:15] of redemption it's an abstract deed with
[1:06:19] it that God required life for death in
[1:06:23] the Garden of Eden then Jesus the
[1:06:26] righteous one died and took a title deed
[1:06:30] and was able to break the seals reveal
[1:06:33] what was in
[1:06:35] them and give the inheritance that
[1:06:38] belonged to him to his
[1:06:43] people eternal life that he inherited by
[1:06:46] doing
[1:06:49] that now if you're going to deal with
[1:06:51] the flesh by the time the Book of
[1:06:53] Revelations and revelation life his body
[1:06:56] was eternal and he was the lamb that
[1:06:59] could take the book and break the
[1:07:01] seals all right he passed his own life
[1:07:05] back at Calvary and divided it Among Us
[1:07:09] by the Holy Ghost amen no man has never
[1:07:11] been able to come and even think of that
[1:07:14] love that that was what he done
[1:07:17] amen but you
[1:07:21] see that's why we were in him when he
[1:07:23] walked the shores of Galilee right amen
[1:07:27] not as little bitty people running
[1:07:28] around in
[1:07:29] there oh it was in his blood and it
[1:07:32] dropped out on the earth messed all that
[1:07:34] up right how was we in
[1:07:40] him he had my inheritance he was
[1:07:43] bringing it to me right he was
[1:07:46] delivering amen my
[1:07:50] inheritance my inheritance is eternal
[1:07:52] life my name was written on the book
[1:07:55] which would mean that I'd come to be
[1:07:57] saved he was coming to deliver it on the
[1:08:00] day of Pentecost he delivered that right
[1:08:04] that's right right he delivered the
[1:08:07] inheritance that he had in him there was
[1:08:11] only one
[1:08:12] person that had eternal life dwelling as
[1:08:15] a human being now did you understand me
[1:08:18] human being right Adam was given eternal
[1:08:22] life right he never lost it and went to
[1:08:26] hell right amen but he never lived
[1:08:29] Eternal in body that's right right but
[1:08:32] here come one that had eternal life born
[1:08:35] with eternal
[1:08:37] life did they say well he didn't get it
[1:08:39] to the River Jordan well I differ with
[1:08:41] that I'm sorry just forget it he when to
[1:08:43] call him the Lord the
[1:08:46] Christ amen I believe in body he was a
[1:08:48] man in spirit he was God in Soul he was
[1:08:51] God and I'm quoting brother
[1:08:53] R that's what I believe and that's what
[1:08:55] what I've always tried to teach because
[1:08:57] I believe what the prophet had to say
[1:08:59] about it but look what he said what he
[1:09:02] what he had we must have cuz he come to
[1:09:06] pass it on to us amen and to do that he
[1:09:09] had to die
[1:09:12] right now God didn't die
[1:09:16] righten
[1:09:19] right the body amen is what died amen
[1:09:24] that's right so the prophet said on
[1:09:25] Calvary God
[1:09:27] ripped right out his own life so
[1:09:31] evidently his life was still left in me
[1:09:33] Calvary right and the way they teach
[1:09:35] River Jordan is life that left him in
[1:09:37] the garden and he just want to for a man
[1:09:39] yeah well see you don't even have any
[1:09:40] eternal life whatsoever doing it that
[1:09:42] way of course those people are real
[1:09:46] popular
[1:09:48] right see that's fine I don't have no
[1:09:51] problem with
[1:09:54] popularity
[1:09:57] I'm trying my best to to see me and you
[1:10:00] saved popularity don't have anything to
[1:10:03] do with this thing
[1:10:05] right cuz remember brother R said money
[1:10:07] women in popularity was the three things
[1:10:10] to get of a Preacher if they wouldn't
[1:10:12] careful well I don't have much
[1:10:14] popularity so I lost St I give away all
[1:10:16] my
[1:10:20] money I'm sure it's 71 years old don't
[1:10:22] need no
[1:10:24] women amen I said it the way I meant it
[1:10:27] when me right that's
[1:10:30] right so it ought to be all over with
[1:10:33] amen but now
[1:10:35] listen brother BR said eternal life that
[1:10:39] he inherited by doing it amen absolutely
[1:10:44] amen now Jesus
[1:10:48] inherited now
[1:10:50] listen what did he
[1:10:54] inherit
[1:10:55] he was almighty God or else he was the
[1:10:57] biggest liar in the
[1:10:59] world what did he
[1:11:01] inherit eternal life in body
[1:11:05] right right yep that's right he never
[1:11:09] inherited eternal life in Soul but
[1:11:12] dying he died to release the life that
[1:11:14] was in him God rele brought out of that
[1:11:21] body that Soul and Spirit come out of
[1:11:24] that body hanging on Calvary that's
[1:11:26] almighty God
[1:11:28] Amen but that body was still a body amen
[1:11:31] that's right I gave you one quote in
[1:11:33] your somewhere he had a
[1:11:34] beginning his body had a beginning
[1:11:37] anything's got a beginning got to have
[1:11:38] an ended to it his body had to be made
[1:11:41] Eternal he inherited
[1:11:44] right but the inheritance was inside of
[1:11:47] him amen I just don't understand that do
[1:11:50] you have eternal
[1:11:53] life you
[1:11:55] your inheritance inside of you right
[1:11:59] right right and you know what that means
[1:12:02] the body's got to follow
[1:12:04] it okay that's right now I'll say
[1:12:07] something and maybe make you want to
[1:12:08] come back this
[1:12:09] evening I believe there's a time when
[1:12:12] Time and Eternity catches up to each
[1:12:15] other and I believe that's this
[1:12:20] time time many eternity is going to come
[1:12:22] together am listen
[1:12:28] let's just read a little
[1:12:30] bit so what' he say eternal life that he
[1:12:32] had he that he inherited by doing that
[1:12:35] he passed his own life back at Calvary
[1:12:37] and divided Among Us by the Holy Ghost
[1:12:39] okay going down Choice the father 63
[1:12:43] 606 he talking about the law penalties
[1:12:46] and the thing had to be done you then
[1:12:48] you eat there you die so it had to be a
[1:12:50] law okay God could not send another
[1:12:53] person to take the place
[1:12:56] it would be unjust again for me to make
[1:13:00] this brother die for what this brother
[1:13:02] done would be wrong God had to come
[1:13:05] himself and the only way he could do it
[1:13:07] was be come in his own flesh which was
[1:13:11] his own Creative Body that he made
[1:13:13] himself that he could suffer death amen
[1:13:17] right there in the gospel in the P there
[1:13:20] is the gospel in the power I like
[1:13:23] that that's go God manifested In the
[1:13:26] Flesh Emmanuel to take away the sins of
[1:13:29] the world Y and in that blood we trust
[1:13:31] not in the BL not in the the Jew or
[1:13:34] Gentile but in the blood of God which
[1:13:37] was Jesus Christ that's the reason he
[1:13:39] said I come I and my father are one my
[1:13:42] father dwelleth in me it was the father
[1:13:44] in
[1:13:45] him that day on Calvary
[1:13:48] 19692 paragraph 56 God required it no
[1:13:52] man was worthy no man was able no man
[1:13:57] could do
[1:13:58] it now if you
[1:14:01] remember not saying there was anything
[1:14:03] wrong with Jesus like a lot of people
[1:14:04] want to preach but just remember Jesus
[1:14:06] said in the flesh there's nothing any
[1:14:08] good that's right the flesh can't give
[1:14:10] you eternal
[1:14:12] life that's why Jesus never gave you an
[1:14:14] inheritance he couldn't give it to
[1:14:17] you you had power to forgive sins he had
[1:14:20] a lot of things but he couldn't give you
[1:14:21] eternal life
[1:14:22] right he had to die to do that cuz the
[1:14:25] eternal life was in him
[1:14:29] right God could not send another person
[1:14:31] to take his place he'd be unjust again
[1:14:34] for me to make this brother die for what
[1:14:35] this brother done he said it'd be wrong
[1:14:37] so going down now that day on Calvary
[1:14:40] God had required it no man was worthy no
[1:14:42] man was able no man could do it you
[1:14:45] remember in the Book of Revelation asked
[1:14:46] for a man
[1:14:48] right why don't somebody jump up and
[1:14:50] preach some things if you're going to
[1:14:51] preach it I believe I can preach era
[1:14:52] better than most people and try to
[1:14:54] preach truth why don't you go over there
[1:14:55] and say Jesus jump up there here I
[1:14:58] am no it didn't do it
[1:15:01] right it was a lamb that jumped up and
[1:15:04] said onto it right which was Jesus
[1:15:07] that's right going to give him in the
[1:15:08] right place right God had required it no
[1:15:11] man was
[1:15:12] worthy no man could do it and God came
[1:15:15] himself and was made known and lived in
[1:15:17] a human
[1:15:19] life under human desires and was
[1:15:22] crucified at Calvary and Di when Satan
[1:15:25] thought he wouldn't do it listen he
[1:15:28] wouldn't go through with it you remember
[1:15:30] he thought he thought he wouldn't do it
[1:15:32] he went to getsy and every Temptation
[1:15:34] that any man ever stood he went to it
[1:15:36] just like all men but he paid the price
[1:15:39] that's what blacked the Earth out like
[1:15:41] an
[1:15:43] anesthestic where they say it for an
[1:15:44] operation the doctor gives you gives a
[1:15:47] man an
[1:15:49] an he first knocks him out before he can
[1:15:52] do it right and when God gave the the
[1:15:55] operation for the church the world got
[1:15:56] an anistic nature for a convulsion no
[1:15:59] wonder God in human flesh was dying
[1:16:02] that's right okay now where's your River
[1:16:05] Jordan people right it was the hour that
[1:16:07] the world had looked for yet many of
[1:16:09] them did not know it like it is today
[1:16:11] many look for these things and yet they
[1:16:13] don't recognize them they don't
[1:16:15] recognize the way out they still trying
[1:16:18] to seek pleasures and things of the
[1:16:19] world trying to find their way out
[1:16:22] Christ The Mystery of God revealed 63 3
[1:16:25] 7:28 prph
[1:16:27] 235 what is it is Christ being
[1:16:31] revealed and he is the word and the when
[1:16:34] the word is revealed it expresses itself
[1:16:37] see that's God's purpose for Jesus was
[1:16:39] to express himself to take his own laws
[1:16:43] and live by his laws come and fulfill
[1:16:46] his law by death and Christ God died in
[1:16:50] flesh in order to condemn sin in the
[1:16:53] flesh that he might bring to himself a
[1:16:55] glorious bride redeemed back that will
[1:16:58] believe only the word of God and swap
[1:17:02] not swap it like he did for intellectual
[1:17:05] conceptions of men you see it that's
[1:17:08] Christ's idea that's God's idea the new
[1:17:10] birth reveals it right so it's not
[1:17:13] revealed to me it's not revealed to you
[1:17:15] we don't have new
[1:17:17] birth right case closed
[1:17:22] amen listen now I'd like to preach on
[1:17:26] this part right here for about 2 weeks
[1:17:27] but I want spoken words Original Seed
[1:17:30] 1962 318 paragraph 124 because I'm like
[1:17:34] this you got Baptist this message you
[1:17:36] got Methodist this message you got
[1:17:38] Presbyterians you got Church of God you
[1:17:40] got congregational Holiness you got you
[1:17:42] got Pentecostal right and they're not
[1:17:44] going to change
[1:17:46] right right so don't worry about it it
[1:17:50] is going to be fear not little for
[1:17:53] right not
[1:17:55] Lula around the
[1:17:58] world that's right all right but listen
[1:18:01] to what he
[1:18:03] says that's what the matter today with
[1:18:06] Pentecostals he says they're trying to
[1:18:08] manufacture something that's what he's
[1:18:09] coming down to show you y That's what's
[1:18:11] the matter with Pentecostals today
[1:18:14] they're manufacturing
[1:18:15] some they can't wait oh God they just
[1:18:19] can't wait so they commit
[1:18:22] adultery now what's committing adultery
[1:18:24] with a Pentecostal committing
[1:18:27] adultery that's he talking about literal
[1:18:29] adultery that happens but what's he
[1:18:32] talking about spiritual adultery
[1:18:36] right lacking the new birth they don't
[1:18:38] have it to commit spiritual adultery
[1:18:40] they can't wait oh God they just can't
[1:18:42] wait so they commit adultery amen tires
[1:18:45] to manufacture
[1:18:46] something and what does it bring forth
[1:18:50] like it did the first time the first
[1:18:53] bride that couldn't wait she brought
[1:18:55] death through a bastard born child which
[1:18:58] we are all children of but God Came In
[1:19:02] the Flesh to give us another birth to
[1:19:05] bring us back to original Sons and
[1:19:07] Daughters of God see there you are the
[1:19:10] life sperm of Eve never happened now
[1:19:13] that's what I said i' like to preach her
[1:19:14] for a while cuz I've always quoted it
[1:19:15] myself always quoted and it's right but
[1:19:18] listen I've always quoted the r sperm of
[1:19:20] Eve never
[1:19:23] happened
[1:19:25] that's the way we' always quoted it you
[1:19:27] better go check
[1:19:29] it it doesn't say that the L
[1:19:34] perm see we're looking at the r firm as
[1:19:37] since she got together and I preached it
[1:19:38] that way and I'm
[1:19:40] sorry that she brought down the wrong
[1:19:45] egg see we quoted the right sperm of Eve
[1:19:48] never
[1:19:50] happened no he said the life
[1:19:53] sperm right
[1:19:57] a lot of difference in the Life sperm of
[1:19:58] Eve and the r
[1:20:00] sperm the r sperm of Eve didn't come
[1:20:02] down because there was no way for her to
[1:20:04] bring down anything right with
[1:20:08] intercourse and intercourse brings the
[1:20:11] sperm you know the you know what I'm
[1:20:13] talking about the Egg of the woman he
[1:20:14] ain't talking about the right the man's
[1:20:17] got the sperm you know what I'm talking
[1:20:19] about see the life sperm of Eve never
[1:20:22] happened why cuz she wi could
[1:20:26] never did why she mingled it kept it
[1:20:28] away instead of Adam coming to her for a
[1:20:30] bride when the time appointed would be
[1:20:34] just like Christ will would have come to
[1:20:36] the group Christ would have come to his
[1:20:38] church he promised to do it God promise
[1:20:40] to multiply them but they had to wait
[1:20:43] until God's time all
[1:20:46] right the what he goes on I'm trying to
[1:20:48] read in the hurry getting late uh
[1:20:50] Paradox 1964
[1:20:52] 418 for if I if I had the jurisdiction
[1:20:57] over you as God had over everything I'd
[1:20:59] say well I'll tell you what anybody
[1:21:02] looks at that light is going to
[1:21:04] die like take the tree and the first
[1:21:06] thing you know this brother sitting here
[1:21:09] this would look at that I feel sorry for
[1:21:13] him I don't want him to die so I have to
[1:21:15] Terry Terry so I'll have Terry here to
[1:21:20] that that wouldn't be right no well if I
[1:21:24] had my own son to to do it that wouldn't
[1:21:27] be
[1:21:27] right there's only one way I can be just
[1:21:30] and that's take his place you see I know
[1:21:33] these things okay a lot of people don't
[1:21:36] and God could not take a human's Place
[1:21:39] being his
[1:21:41] spirit all right so God didn't die right
[1:21:45] Spirit God can't die in spirit form he
[1:21:48] can't die he had to come in flesh form
[1:21:51] to be able to die to release the life
[1:21:54] that was in him which was our
[1:21:55] inheritance that's right right are you
[1:21:59] following
[1:22:02] me God could not take a human God could
[1:22:05] not take a human's Place being he is
[1:22:07] spirit so he created a blood cell which
[1:22:10] was his own son Jesus Christ and God
[1:22:13] came in and lived in there and lived
[1:22:16] identified himself in Christ that was
[1:22:18] God Emmanuel Jesus said I and my father
[1:22:21] are one my father dwells in me see God
[1:22:25] in Christ reconciled in the world Jesus
[1:22:27] was the body the Tabernacle God was the
[1:22:30] spirit that lived in him all right so we
[1:22:35] agree God in spirit form can't die no in
[1:22:40] spirit form he didn't die on Calvary he
[1:22:43] pulled that life come
[1:22:45] outen that's right had not the life left
[1:22:48] out of the body they could have cut in a
[1:22:50] million pieces it would still been
[1:22:53] living
[1:22:56] but he released the
[1:22:58] life but you know that life came back to
[1:23:00] pick up that same body then he made that
[1:23:03] body Eternal so he inherited eternal
[1:23:05] life himself in body now he's capable of
[1:23:08] being able to bring us to eternal life
[1:23:10] in body which is what Adam could not
[1:23:12] come to because of the sin right
[1:23:16] okay now I hope I'm going to refice so
[1:23:19] it's up to you this is p one 19 it's p
[1:23:23] 1920 know through in the church A's book
[1:23:26] The revelation of Jesus Christ this is
[1:23:28] the one the brother said these years are
[1:23:30] things he said he wished had and written
[1:23:33] why because it's contrary to his
[1:23:34] Doctrine y 1 Timothy 3:16 without
[1:23:38] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:23:39] godliness God was manifest in flesh
[1:23:41] justified in the spirit seen of angels
[1:23:43] preached unto the Gentiles now I'd like
[1:23:46] to spay a week on that where did he
[1:23:47] preach to the gentille he told him not
[1:23:49] to go right he's now preaching to the
[1:23:53] Gentiles he preach to the Gentiles from
[1:23:55] the church agent is coming on down
[1:23:57] because it's a gentile dispensation
[1:23:58] through his bride that's why I don't
[1:23:59] believe in Oneness I believe in true
[1:24:02] Oneness he's still manifesting himself
[1:24:05] believed on in the world received up in
[1:24:07] the glory that's what the Bible said it
[1:24:09] doesn't say a thing about a first or
[1:24:11] second or third person here it said God
[1:24:13] was manifest in flesh one God that one
[1:24:16] God was manifest in flesh that ought to
[1:24:19] settle it God came in human in a human
[1:24:22] form y that didn't make him another God
[1:24:25] he was God the same God it was a
[1:24:28] revelation then and it's Revelation now
[1:24:30] one God look back in the Bible and see
[1:24:33] what he was in the beginning according
[1:24:34] to the Revelation he gave him
[1:24:37] himself the great Jehovah appeared to
[1:24:39] Israel in a pillar of fire an angel of
[1:24:41] the Covenant he lived in that Pillar of
[1:24:42] Fire and L Israel daily at the temple he
[1:24:45] announced his coming with a great Cloud
[1:24:47] then one day he was manifested in a
[1:24:49] virgin born body that was prepared for
[1:24:53] him the god that tabernacled above the
[1:24:56] tents of Israel now took on himself a
[1:24:59] tent of Flesh and tabernacled as a man
[1:25:01] amongst men but he was the same God
[1:25:06] right the Bible teaches that God was in
[1:25:08] Christ the body was Jesus in him dwell
[1:25:11] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:25:13] nothing can be pler than that mystery
[1:25:16] yes but actual truth it can't be plainer
[1:25:19] so if he wasn't three people then he
[1:25:22] can't be three now one God and this same
[1:25:25] God was made
[1:25:27] flesh continual reading Jesus said
[1:25:31] number 10 on your note I came from God
[1:25:33] and I go back to God John 16:27 28 that
[1:25:37] is exactly what happened he disappeared
[1:25:39] from Earth by way of his death burial
[1:25:42] resurrection and Ascension then Paul met
[1:25:45] him on the road to Damascus and he spoke
[1:25:46] to Paul and
[1:25:48] said now I want to stop here and pray sa
[1:25:52] sa why persecuted th me
[1:25:56] now according to Paul and according to
[1:25:58] the Bible that was
[1:26:04] Jesus I thought Jesus was just a
[1:26:07] man I thought God just used Jesus just
[1:26:09] to dumped him somewhere TR scanned him
[1:26:13] or done something with
[1:26:15] him you know it's odd this fill our fire
[1:26:17] that I'm Jesus right whom got persecuted
[1:26:22] right then when you lete for years and I
[1:26:25] have for years on it but people ain't
[1:26:27] going to listen to you so why all saw
[1:26:30] why persecutest thou me Paul said who
[1:26:31] art thy Lord he said I am Jesus he was a
[1:26:34] pillar of fire blinding light it turned
[1:26:37] back exactly like he said he would back
[1:26:39] to the same form that he was before he
[1:26:42] took on a tabernacle of Flesh and
[1:26:44] exactly how John saw it John 1:18 no man
[1:26:48] has seen God at any time the only
[1:26:50] begotten which is in the bosom of the
[1:26:51] father he had declared him and brought
[1:26:53] him out in the opy notice where John
[1:26:56] says that Jesus is is in the bosom of
[1:26:59] the
[1:27:02] father now we read from God rich in
[1:27:04] Mercy 65119 paragraph
[1:27:07] 104 then God rich in Mercy sent forth A
[1:27:10] Savior Jesus Christ he sent forth Jesus
[1:27:12] to be both Savior and healer he said as
[1:27:15] Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the
[1:27:17] wilderness so must the son of man be
[1:27:19] lifted up for the same purpose he the
[1:27:22] atonement that's why he what we have
[1:27:25] claim upon nothing but the atonement but
[1:27:29] Jesus purchased by his blood that's what
[1:27:31] we have claims upon and the Bible said
[1:27:34] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:27:36] Bru for our iniquity the chasti of our
[1:27:38] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:27:40] were healed that's what we claim because
[1:27:42] that's what that's what the atonement
[1:27:45] that we stand for ordered for us God
[1:27:48] rich in Mercy this has to be an eternal
[1:27:50] atonement because he came himself God
[1:27:54] came himself in the form of sinful flesh
[1:27:57] to make a a a an eternal atonement and
[1:28:00] suffered in flesh and made the atonement
[1:28:03] and returned back in the form of the
[1:28:04] Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement for
[1:28:07] no bright serent and no trouble Waters
[1:28:09] could do it that's right it all pointed
[1:28:11] to that perfect atonement God rich in
[1:28:14] Mercy future home this is just to get to
[1:28:17] the point see what happened at River
[1:28:19] Jordan and here descending Out of Heaven
[1:28:22] future home paragraph 310
[1:28:24] 1964
[1:28:27] 802 and here come descending Out of
[1:28:30] Heaven the form of a dove and a voice
[1:28:31] saying this is my part of the earth that
[1:28:33] I have redeemed and from this part of
[1:28:35] the earth I'll redeem the rest of it
[1:28:37] amen for he has
[1:28:39] made my word he for he is my word made
[1:28:46] manifest the life when anybody has to
[1:28:48] know it got a little sense reading it
[1:28:49] anything has a beginning has an
[1:28:51] ending so the body of Jesus
[1:28:54] had a beginning the body of Jesus had an
[1:28:57] ending the body of Jesus had to be made
[1:28:59] Eternal at the resurrection so he
[1:29:00] inherited eternal life but in doing it
[1:29:04] he got something and in doing it I got
[1:29:06] something right cuz he made a way amen
[1:29:09] that God could come and live in you and
[1:29:12] I that's right in the new
[1:29:15] birth to release that life so Jesus
[1:29:18] never gave me an inheritance the flesh
[1:29:20] can't do
[1:29:21] it and while he had it within him
[1:29:25] he could not give eternal life to anyone
[1:29:29] right you believe that while he was on
[1:29:32] Earth Jesus walking here in flesh he
[1:29:33] couldn't give that to
[1:29:36] anyone I know come on I know the
[1:29:39] scriptures and I know what the prophet
[1:29:40] says to where he comes over breathes on
[1:29:42] them and said receive you the Holy Ghost
[1:29:45] brother said they didn't get it till the
[1:29:46] day of Pentecost that was just a promise
[1:29:49] all right so we're still in the message
[1:29:52] I like to do it that way cuz somebody
[1:29:53] sitting that there their computer
[1:29:55] clicking you know oh but this quote go
[1:29:56] this quote this quote this quote well I
[1:29:58] like quote
[1:30:01] with go it
[1:30:04] right see God the only way he could
[1:30:07] deliver our inheritance remember they
[1:30:09] had to be one between God the spirit
[1:30:13] God and the reader of the will the
[1:30:16] reader of the will is a person on Earth
[1:30:17] that tells you what's in that will he
[1:30:19] has nothing to do with the will
[1:30:21] whatsoever he's paid to read it
[1:30:25] that's the preachers that's the
[1:30:27] prophet but there had to be one in
[1:30:29] between y That's right to be able to
[1:30:32] turn around and
[1:30:34] say here it
[1:30:37] is I have the
[1:30:40] ability to lay my life
[1:30:43] down I have the ability to keep it in
[1:30:46] other words I'm not going to do it where
[1:30:49] you can have what I've got within me I'm
[1:30:52] going to die
[1:30:56] and I love that where it says we're join
[1:30:58] ours with Jesus
[1:30:59] Christ because you see he got eternal
[1:31:03] life and body
[1:31:05] y in the resurrection right amen a body
[1:31:10] that had a beginning was made Eternal am
[1:31:13] but in doing all of that he transmitted
[1:31:15] his own
[1:31:16] life down to where you and I could have
[1:31:19] eternal life now what are we
[1:31:21] doing waiting the Redemption of the body
[1:31:27] right we've read it there in Acts enough
[1:31:29] un the purchase the you know the
[1:31:33] purchase possession is done yep see all
[1:31:35] this is not finished yet right you can
[1:31:39] comb your hair different and that's what
[1:31:41] certain man done years ago way back he
[1:31:43] started letting his high grow out and
[1:31:45] boy he was doing bill and he was
[1:31:46] preaching immortality In the Flesh you
[1:31:48] know what he
[1:31:49] died right that's not a joke he died
[1:31:53] right
[1:31:55] but you don't what they probably a lot
[1:31:56] of people still preaching you know
[1:31:58] brother so and so T more immortal in
[1:32:01] Flex let's go down to his grave today
[1:32:03] and put some flowers on come we thank
[1:32:04] him for telling us
[1:32:06] this no no no he
[1:32:09] did right he evidently didn't understand
[1:32:12] it you
[1:32:14] know but you see one day Time and
[1:32:17] Eternity will meet that's right and
[1:32:20] immortality will be here right it's only
[1:32:24] because you start your eternal life by
[1:32:26] receiving the new birth
[1:32:28] right what's wrong with most of the
[1:32:30] people this message reading are not not
[1:32:32] preaching the truth they don't have the
[1:32:33] new birth that's just plain language
[1:32:35] it's can be argue with me about it
[1:32:37] that's right amen I'm not going to argue
[1:32:39] with you all I'm just going to tell you
[1:32:40] what brother R
[1:32:44] said Jesus Christ come to release that
[1:32:47] life that was in him that you might be
[1:32:49] able to receive it he was the one
[1:32:51] between God and man the man in Christ
[1:32:54] Jesus that's why he's our
[1:32:57] Advocate amen you see why we can keep on
[1:33:00] preaching too L come on
[1:33:03] Brothers you can't it's hard to preach
[1:33:06] this message not it's hard to
[1:33:09] stop it's hard to just quit you just
[1:33:11] have to quit start over again you know
[1:33:15] but thank God for the truth
[1:33:18] right you say but my God didn't die you
[1:33:23] better change your thoughts we know God
[1:33:26] didn't
[1:33:27] die but we know God In the Flesh died
[1:33:30] that's right that's
[1:33:32] it that's what your Prophet
[1:33:35] said right you better believe that body
[1:33:37] wasn't just a body brought by Mary and
[1:33:42] Joseph right and it wasn't brought by
[1:33:45] Mary and God right right it was brought
[1:33:50] by almighty God speaking the word the
[1:33:53] egg the sperm or you say those things
[1:33:55] was put together by God himself man had
[1:33:58] nothing to do with
[1:34:00] it but in that body a purpose for death
[1:34:04] was was brought into the world that he
[1:34:07] could die for us and release that life
