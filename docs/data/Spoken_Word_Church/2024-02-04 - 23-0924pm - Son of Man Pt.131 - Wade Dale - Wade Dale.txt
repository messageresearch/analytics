after the bride leaves oh what's going to happen in those hospitals and what's going to happen with those emergency room people and the equipment and all the things that they'll need for this Mass casualties and all the things that are coming but Lord you you said You' take us out of the here before that you gave us a promise that we would not see that we might see small part but we will not see the fullness we will be taken away your wife is making herself ready now and now I pray Lord Lord that we will come to that culmination that we'll go to a marriage supper that it'll be finished here for the Gentiles we'll be moved over into another dimension and Lord you can clean this Earth off father just forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make against you Lord bless your

time of need Lord the time of Separation Lord that you'll give them Comfort you're the only one cuz you're the prince of peace Father just give us the words to say today in Jesus name amen part 131 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 3 verely verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word John 16:12 says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now now this is Jesus talking to us all right he said how be it when he this person this he he don't have a problem with his gender he God is the he cuz he's our husband and we are his wife feminis by designation but when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth amen for he shall not speak of himself now watch this watch this corner that he's turning I caught this yesterday and I wanted to to bring this now for he shall not speak of himself you tell me who's going to speak to you tell me he's going to speak through he's telling you right here he's shifting he said he he the husband all right he will guide you into all truth and there's that whatever that pause semicolon whatever you're looking at there for he what is that that's what I said colon semicolon I just made just throw it out there you're a nurse not a ma not the a mathematician or electrician how about an English major for he look for he that one that's going to lead you and guide you into all truth he is not going to speak of himself now we speak of him but remember everything he's got he's right here this is this is John chapter what John chapter 16 verse2 heading into John 17 which is the the Lord praying for us how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth all right for he shall not speak of himself he has not spoken of himself for 2,000 years we speak of him as our husband but he has spoke to us as the bride and then he had in the end he put a stamp on it through a prophet that says I now call you bride not church for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever look whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak right through who through us all right and he will show you bride things to come he don't have to show himself things to come come he knows whats to come he's the one is here they coming and going and knows about tomorrow yesterday and every other day but he will show you the bride he's going to transfer all that to the bride and show you things to come I thought man that scripture if we just read it like that that'll just it'll just put all the emphasis on Jesus Christ but he's putting all the emphasis on us so let him put the emphasis on us and he has and he did and he will all right for he shall not speak of himself amen so so you know what I hear bride bride bride bride I love you you're my bride I'm going to talk to you I'm going to tell you about me but I'm going to tell you through my bride about me amen you love that I love that that's just wonderful and show you things to come so he's going to show you Revelation he's going to give you insight into [Music] tomorrow what a mighty God we serve that's that's why the Holy Ghost is that whole Center of that scripture is the Holy Ghost in you that whole Center is he it's not yeah it's him I know it's him but he has decided he's decided to give all things listen he decided to put all things in the sun did he not that's what he said I put all things the in I believe it's in John 17 he he's committed all things to the son so now where's the son of man he's in me and you right not over there right here and he's going to speak of him through you Misses Jesus Christ amen Revelations 19:6 and I heard as a word the voice of multitude is the voice of many Waters Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth in other words something happened before that Thunder we'll talk about that a little bit later on let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him now look to him but he's fixing to talk about his wife he's fixing to brag on her I I want people to brag on June I don't care if they you brag on me or not brag on her she's the one that gets all the honor she's the one that takes a lot of the load she's the one that's the the you know they saw the matriarch of the family sure we're the man we're supposed to be the manly guy and all that but we also are the bride so we should be a little bit on the feminist side knowing that the Lord is our head all right but now what did he decide to do like I said before he decided to talk about us and he didn't just decide to talk about us through him he decided to talk about us through us that's what he just said he's not going to talk of himself anymore he's put everything in his bride everything he's put into the bride for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife that's made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white that's what this statue of perfect man is doing folks is cleaning us up not in our soul if you're born again you're already clean but he's cleaning us up in our daily walk our spiritual being the spirit part of us the memory reason conscious affection and Imagination all right for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints 1 Peter 1:22 says seeing you have purified your souls now we're going to today we'll break this down we didn't get time to do it this morning I enjoyed preaching this morning if y'all didn't enjoy listening then I'm you know sorry I'm not bragging on me I want God to get something to you I want you to see something all right I want you like and and listen like the same thing as the husbandman and the wife I want God to bless you I tell me sister Regina was talking and we you know I want everybody in this building to get it that's right I know you can't get it same equal but I want you to get something I don't want to leave nobody behind I do not I like the Marine motto you know no man left behind you know what if there's one got to go get him right brother Donnie you got to go get him you're not going to get on that helicopter with somebody still there we're going to get back off head right back into the face of the enemy amen that's right amen and get that Soul get that person and bring them back that's what we should have every one of us should be all don't ever count anybody off or out want them all to come okay I do I want us all to make it together seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit now look oh we'll talk about Soul spirit and Body in just a few minutes all right all we're going to talk about Soul spirit and adoption all right we'll see that in just a minute I want to break it apart real quick so that we can see really why this statue of perfect man is so important unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible another words corruptible seed has been down through the church ages because we're going to read here just in a minute when we read this morning where Satan got into the church made it cold formal and Powerless how did he do that through preaching he took corruptable seed now look he took corruptible seed and made the congregation think it was Incorruptible righten think it was the truth right you know if you tell a lie so many times to somebody they're just going to believe it amen that was a boy we used to hunt with we talking about the other day brought back memories Tony was a little he's a he was a little bit slow but he never shot that deer he wasn't even knowwhere around we convinced that Boy by the time I'm sorry we lied to him so much so he was telling people that he shot it by the time we got to Gillsville and believed it and he never pulled the trigger so you tell somebody something enough they going to believe it if you tell it to them and make it real tantalizing you know right but that's corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God so the only way you're going to get incorrupt able seed is by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever it's a Living Word it's not a letter word it's a living word which liveth and abideth forever that word there being born again means to produce again so in other words what I'm looking at is is that God produced a bride in the first church age on the day of Pentecost there was a Bride come out a mature bride now look that bride was was mature on that day of Pentecost they had been taught by Jesus the word himself the word was made flesh he would they were taught and tutored and then all of a sudden whatever they had packed inside of them the Holy Ghost anointed that and then indwelled them and it quickened everything that they had taugh been taught okay which put them right here so see that's not a new position to be in right that's one we lack because of us amen we lack this because we've let man's Traditions we've let corruptible seed I don't say we I'm talking about the whole bride down through the church ages from the first church age to today there's been Parts as brother B said loose ends that needed to be tied up all right and as I've always told you the way I look at it is is the word of God is eternal correct the word of God is not up and down and back and forth and it's there's no broken parts of the word of God because it's Eternal so you got this great strand of Eternity big rope running down through the church ages well when they got to Nia they cut the rope father son Holy Ghost baptism well here drops the two ends they come over here and say well there's a trinitarian oh yeah he's a trinity well they cut the rope Satan did and it dropped it down it didn't do away with the word it just took and cut a section out out and that section dropped well then at the end time as God I'll read it to you just a minute brother Brown come here to do a job but even God said I will restore so that's a promise I will restore all the years 19 from from 8030 to today so what did Brother Bram said he said that Messenger will tie up all the Loose Ends so he grabbed this rope and this rope tied them back together right goes over here and he takes this rope this loose end grabs it ties it back together and makes it back into one Eternal strand of the word of God that's just the way I see it he took every bit of that all those gaps and filled them up why did he fill them up listen God w at the ignorance of people down through the church ages but when we come into this church age we are a special group of people this group of people's got to get it right because there's not another church age for us to hand it off to and say well we kind of messed it up in this age y'all can take care of it no MM we're either staying here or going up one of the two all right so that's our mandate to get out of here but you got to get out of here with a full word not with part word all right you must be born again brother ra said look said you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God all these other things doesn't change you the new birth is an experience something that takes place you've got to really look at this like an event and to me it is an event like you sisters we said many times before you you you had the baby you know when you had the baby all right right so there was an event you had to go to the hospital the doctor had to do this they had to do that this had to be done that had to be done everything had to be set up and then here comes a baby and we understand how that all happens all right so there was an event something went on and something happened and you knew about it well that's the way your new birth is you're supposed to you should not wonder where you got born again you shouldn't now you going to listen in your mind Satan right now though is he's plugging he's saying no you really don't know you you really don't need that you really this is this and this no you got to say look buddy this is that right here this is the point and you know what I can tell the same I was was reading something the other day and somebody made a profound statement if you tell the truth the first time you don't have to remember what to lie about the next time right if you tell the truth if you start with a lie you got to remember what that lie was and tell it the same way 50 different times that's why I want to tell these people about the message they say brother I'm this brother I'm that he kept his story straight the whole time right the whole time his whole life he didn't stop one day and say oh man that really didn't happen now it happened cuz he lived it right I lived being married to June cuz I was there so I can tell you about it you know what don't have to lie about it either don't have to fabricate what went on I was there so the day you got born again you better have been been there cuz it was for you he said well I believe brother Aaron got it cuz you know he did this and that and the other no the only person that knows God is him right amen cuz it's that individual what individual personal relationship with God or brother R said what Jesus Christ personally he's going to come personally into you and he's going to say you are my child I am pleased to dwell in you let's get this thing started amen been waiting on you all your life you know what God said I've been waiting on you all my life too hey if you're an if you're an eternal part of God that's what he's been waiting on the whole time he's had you in his mind the whole time never not thought of you never never was a time when he said how'd you get here no he knew where you'd be he knew how you'd get here then knew how you get him but you shall receive power hour after see the the church the first church that first church in Ephesus brother R said it was a powerful Church 12 people but they were powerful because they all had the Holy Ghost right not to say they didn't have issues but they all had the Holy Ghost they all had things common they all were in one mind and one Accord they they were they were they they forwarded trying to pick my words they forwarded the gospel in the time that they were supposed to they by with me cuz see Jesus had just died went off the scene Pentecost had just happened ad30 all right then you got Paul coming in and being a church age messenger you got Paul coming in him being the messenger and them accepting Paul's message that you're predestinated that you're adopted that you're that you're uh that you're in him you found in him before the foundation of the world Christ in you the hope of glory there was Paul that was the message of the day and they accepted that message and they were a great powerful church because the Holy Ghost worked in every one of themen pray for that pray for that to happen in this church and I do for every person to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost man if you don't then you know I'm sorry we got to make it available for everybody amen but you shall receive power after that's why the the 12 Ephesian church members had power they received power after the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and I say the the group that Paul met that have you re received the Holy Ghost since you believed I believe they became a powerful church after they all received the Holy Ghost all right that was what Cornelius was it Cornelius was it in Acts 19 we've been reading it but you know they didn't even know if they had there was anything about the Holy Ghost they were preaching the power of the word just by word right right and by baptism right John's baptism Paul comes in and Paul said that's okay but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed they said we don't know anything about the Holy Ghost In other words we have been taught and Paul said give me a minute let me talk to you about this holy ghost that I got and so what happened to them they got hands laid on they all got the Holy Ghost spoking tongues and powerful group of people I would say but we were talking this morning about the reason listen the Reason God gives Satan this permitted power I didn't cover this this morning is because of Joel two the church had to go in the ground the church had to accept false Doctrine for him to birth a church come on for him to birth a bride tree that was more powerful than the other one right if you don't understand that let me explain it to you the church was powerful in the first three Church ages then all that got eat chopped down every how you want to talk about diluted it got watered down not by the watering of the word but by the watering of the devil it got watered down so diluted made what lukewarm cold and Powerless but it was still a church right God gave Satan the power to do that because he knew listen he knew there'd be a group of people that wouldn't that would fall for this so he gave him an opportunity he gave him a choice amen pretty simple right you said no he's a respected person no he's not cuz there was a group of people that stood right here in the face of this power and withstood it right amen amen and grew that bride tree grew back up under the power of What Not the power of the man power the people power of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost got brought back into the church instead of being lukewarm cold and Powerless they brought the Holy Ghost back into the church so here's permitted power and they went out of talking about the red horse White Horse and all those the power was given to it to do these different things permitted power brother B tells us is how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless all right that's what it did but now watch he's going to restore according to Joel 2 and even Jesus stood one day and he said look I can't do you any good standing here today right I can't do you any good unless this corn of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abideth alone because I have you in me amen and I can't get you out unless I die right right so this corn of wheat's got to die it's got to fall in the ground die brother Brown said that body laid cold dead in the grave he said the word laid dead cold in the grave that word body was laying there dead now the inside guy was working he he had left the building to do his work but remember he comes back because I will restore now when he when he was when Jesus was restored now remember Jesus prec crucifixion didn't have a glorified body he didn't know all things are we good there they didn't know all things there's a lot of things he did not know amen so he had to go into the ground die to fulfill Joel and all the other scriptures and what he stood one day and said this corn of wheat's got to fall on the ground ground and die but when it comes back up there'll not just be one seed there'll be many seed so we were inside of him captured inside of a body a body of Flesh that groaned and moaned that had to eat that had to go through good days and bad days that had to uh watch where he stepped and watch what he did and what right but now when he come back up in a glorified body all that had been left and he come out what now all Heaven and Earth everything everything's in my power now I've got what I'm supposed to get I fulfilled all scripture except for one right I got to get back in my bride I'll come back as the comforter give you the Holy Ghost I read John 16 he's going to give you power right after the Holy Ghost has come upon you wasn't just an anointing it was an indwelling he could not indwell us inside of one human body with me right inside of one human body he was caught but he was caught as the prophet of God I love what he said for the purpose of death was he put in that human body but it wasn't the purpose of him dying just to die and go away the purpose was for him to die to release me and you praise the Lord to release us he released the life so that that seed wouldn't have to go back now we know in type through the church ages in the fourth Church age brother Ram types it as the seed going into the ground again almost dying but coming back out but the the very whole scripture was on what Jesus was doing folks it it depended on Jesus to go in the ground it depended on Jesus to die it depended on that seed to rot in the ground now we know his body didn't rot we know that but it's dead there was no life in it it was cold praise God it didn't corrupt amen when he picked that thing up he said hey all power in heaven and Earth's been given unto me now amen I'm ready I'm ready I got one more thing to do he said go Terry they started saying now aren't you going aren't you going to whip these Roman I thought you was comeing to set up a kingdom he's like go to Jerusalem I've taught y'all for three and a half years you ain't learned nothing they did pack it in though but he said go to Jerusalem you'll be in duded with power from on high 11 days from now just just NOP let go on over there cuz when they did what's the first thing Paul Peter said he said this is that this is that he goes back in the Old Testament says this is it well I believe the prophet gave us a message and this is it we are going to leave this place not as a defeated bride but as a bride that has already put on her garments right here amen sure there'll be rewards there'll be crowns there'll be all kind of different things when we get there but you get your white robe right here the cleanness and the righteousness of the Saints is right here it's not over there it's right here all right when you got born again you put on that robe of righteousness all right we'll talk about that in just a second if you'll give me a little give me a little time Satan crept into the church blinded the people now how how he blind them through preaching and when they were blinded it wasn't long till the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus and all the other things that they stopped doing right now watch I told you I was going to read this Revelation 2:6 says but this thou Hast that th that thou hatest look that thou hatest he's talking about the church age y'all hate them and I hate them too but it was then it was a deed it was talked about well what do you think about old brother so and so he he's what do you think about this serenus guy he's saying that Jesus wasn't really God uh he was just a kind of a piece or a part and and then he become the fullness and you know he starts preaching all this false Doctrine well yeah that was there which was a deed but watch that deed finally turned into listen santhus must have got a pull pet and he kept preaching that and preaching it and preaching it till somebody believed it amen because uh that word hate in the Bible means detest so God just detested he don't even want it nowhere around Revelations 2:14 which is a continuation of the church ages this is another church age but I have a few things against you because thou Hast them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught bailot to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to things sacrific into Idols commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine now it's not just a d it's not just somebody having a little having a little corner session I don't know about this preacher I don't know if he's telling the truth this may I think I see it this way no when it becomes a Doctrine that's when you preach it behind the pull Pit Brother Ram said every church has to have a what a Doctrine or you're not in a church so we have a Doctrine the fullness of the word that's our Doctrine uh adoption is our Doctrine um growth is our is our doctrine that we preach here in this church all right and I believe it's the truth so as thou also them that hold the doctrine of nians which thing I hate amen repent so you do have a way to get out repent or else I will come unto thee quickly now watch and will fight against them with the sword what he's going to put somebody that'll yield theirself as brother Dale different ones he'll put somebody in a pull pit that will yield to him and he'll give them the word or the sword of the truth and whack that thing out master surgeon cut that thing out praise God it's a pull pit is where it started no wonder that's the damnation of this country when Satan got in the pull pit it's the truth failing to preach the unadulterated word of God and the word of God will produce just exactly what it said it would do but we explain it all the way oh you know we uh and and I'll read you here in just a minute where brother R talks about being Tim oh we don't have to have church order really oh we're above that we we're just led by the spirit of God yeah you led by a spirit all right that's right it's not of God right cuz listen God has never been out of order God has never been dysfunctional God has never been where everything was not in order now we have but he hasn't so why don't we just yield to the guy that knows everything that never does anything wrong all right no we decide to go over here to this other guy cuz he makes it all tantalizing and happy and and you know fireworks and and beautiful colors and the Lord's just over here going just do what I right just just do what I ask ain't no flowers I ain't got a flower nothing ain't nothing here I don't have to give you patted pews which we do I don't have to give you all this stuff just believe what I said but when Satan got a hold of it in other words he broke through the walls he mared a masterpiece talking about it in the Garden of Eden we know what happened but remember I thank God there was a there was a God that could do something there there was somebody that was standing there in in his person not somebody floating around he was standing there talking to Adam and Eve he said look I know what you done I knew you were going to do it and there's going to be a division but I'm going to put that division back together I'm going to come myself I'm not goingon to listen I'm not going to trust Abraham I I'm not going to trust Adam Adam was God of the Earth but he couldn't save you you I've got to come back I'm the Savior I can save you what's inside of me comes inside of you it will save you amen if Adam could have done that you'd have just acted like Adam right that's why we act like the world when we have the world inside of us and we act like God when we got God inside of us it's just pretty simple he is God he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately to build own image of man we'll skip that we read that this morning but I like this one right here look how can any messenger sent from God believe only a part of the word and deny some of it a true prophet of God in this last day will proclaim the true Prophet the whole word denominations will hate him well there's a marker because they hated him they still hate him that's right his words may be as marer John the Baptist who called them vipers but the predestinated will hear and be ready for the Rapture amen as somebody was preaching out I think it was brother no Johnson was you know there there's a word that that there's a thunder there's word there's all kind of scenes going on in Paul's time and then we'll talk about here in just a minute about when the adoption of Jesus when he went up on the mountain there was this voice that said this is my beloved Son and and that it confused all them that were sitting there right first St Peter said says let's make a trinitarian Doctrine out of it right let's make three Tabernacles you know what God said shut up that's right cuz remember the next thing they saw was Jesus himself one person Jesus only all right the first seal when that seal open are beginning to open listen it already been open to the to the to the prophet before he preached it obviously all right he got the Revelation that day and was preaching it to the people he said now I'm going to call you bride in other words I'm going to separate he said I know where that white horse rider is what his power is and where he's at he's in the church right he's in the people that's right but we've got to see him ride away go away from us I'm going to call you bride that you'll understand the prophet tells us is we have Satan's answer we need a realize that we have Satan's answer you know what he's hid he can hide in false Doctrine that's right he can hide in unbelief but he cannot hide in the perfect word of Goden and he cannot hide in Full Faith right brother Ram says hallelujah the headship is here Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power now look the same power as on the day of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer and that was think about this but you you know you take Paul Paul was a great warrior but remember when when you write when Jesus was writing I say Jesus it was Jesus that was on the a of patmas telling John about the church ages he said you've lost your first love something's crept in after Paul has preached his heart out remember the messenger comes at the end of the age Paul came at the end of Pentecost and brought his message he wasn't there the full time that church agent was going on don't get silent on me right messenger comes at the end of the CH Church age Paul didn't come at the end of the first church age he came at the end of Pentecost all right right then he brings his message and then somebody else gets a thought from somebody beside God and he makes it what lukewarm cold and Powerless that's right but yet it's still in the church age so and Satan said I got a bunch of them second Church age irus then you got serenus and different ones boy then the Third Church age and the fourth Church age he was just having a blast when they went to NAA and he started just diluting the word of God and making a change made the word of God change that now Jesus is a light substance of God so he must be the second person of a trinity now we're going to come up with this word Trinity uh we we don't we're not going to baptize in Jesus name anymore we don't want that Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost so that's what we're going to take Satan's over there going a boy and God's going I knew this was going to happen but I got to let it happen amen I got to let it happen so that the true word will show itself and make itself known amen but now look he has a formidable opponent and it's a woman amen right it's the bride his opponent now is the bride that's right but see Satan just don't believe that God has already told us back there in John 16 I'm going to put myself in you and I ain't going to talk about me no more we going to talk about her amen listen he defeated Satan at Calvary who's going to fulfill that right here everybody raise your hand and go right here right here this is where he's going to be defeated sure he was defeated at Calvary but guess what people have died by the millions since he died on the cross to destroy death now he destroyed death at Calvary right and proved it brother R said by res resurrecting 3 days later that's right what's our problem our conquerors already conquered at all but Satan jumps right back in and starts pouring his poison in it oh you really think you going to be able to do that why did Jesus tell us to baptize in father son Holy Ghost I'll tell you what Jesus said so why he said baptize in a name not a title that's right but you know what Satan Satan listen Satan hid in the ignorance of the church cuz listen Luther was a trinitarian Luther baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost they didn't have that great Revelation but God winked to ignorance of them because they weren't a for formidable opponent they didn't have to destroy death this bride has to end their body in your flesh death has to be destroyed Body Spirit and soul not just not just Soul he's already destroying the soul that's one thing sat can't understand when you get born again he cannot understand your soul anymore he understood it the first time though cuz he was a a resident of it but once you throw that Resident out and you seal that thing in put that seal on it if he touches it brother R said like 10 million volts where he used to just walk in and go in and out your soul all he wanted to hey how you doing I love you well I love you too have another drink right right but now oh let me in no right I'll give you no I have your answer h right brother J say booil but we have his answer and listen it's not just it's not just a comedy we laugh it's but it's not a comedy we are his formidable opponent listen that dude has been around almost as long as God has I said almost so he's learned God's tactics and then hear us weak Americans or whatever you want to say say uh humans here we come on Earth and Satan's like H man I got this bunch of softies he said I can play with their emotion I can get in their mind and I can play and he did it all down through the church all down through the church ages in the new in the Old Testament he played all down through here but he come down to where he found one guy and when that guy was born he said man I don't know how to deal with this guy I can't get in a soul I I you know I can bother him but he just don't ever give in amen he's just different I hope they say that about you the devils are like go ahead have it fit but have it somewhere else amen right he can be SP over all he wants to but he can spaz somewhere else he's not spazzing on me or you anymore if you're born again right that's why listen folks we have Satan's answer because we are a for formidable opponent that means we have Satan's answer as brother R said we have his answer what everything he talks to us about we should have an answer about because listen we're not to be deceived others were deceived other Church Ages were even deceived sorry to say that Luther was deceived into believing that father son Holy Ghost was a correct baptism right but not when you come to the end time where a prophet has to restore the word back to the first church age plus amen plus listen we should be in the plus we should be in the plus Paul had a group that thought he thought they were in the plus and he started preaching to them and he said hold on a minute y'all still babies that's right I'll read it to you in just a minute Desiring the Sens of the word which look that's okay desire it they at least they desire the the word but they wanted milk but the formidable opponent is Jesus Christ in you in his fullness amen CU remember the Son of God down through the church ages Satan could reside close by amen he could deceive he could make you you know think you're right and you're not but now they wasn't a day when the Lord Jesus the son of man was walking the Earth and he said I think that guy may be right talking about the devil you know he told me he'd give me the whole world he told me if I fail that that the Angels would would would pick me up right right well now he told me that that if I was hungry I had the power no Jesus was sitting there the whole time going when you're finished when you're finished you finishing the see I'm Different I don't play I'm your formidable opponent and now where is that formidable opponent that walked in Jesus Christ it's in Me and You by the new birth and in his fullness not just in part there been churches churches Brides churches Brides brides but thank God there's got to come one and that's us in the end time one there's not a Baptist bride anymore they used to be they used to be a Methodist bride they used to be a Pentecostal Bride come on yes sir they did if they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost under their age they're just as Eternal as you are and their bride everybody with me but brother R he said there got to come one God don't have a Baptist bride anymore listen they left him the Methodist bride left their lover they left their husband and went after what cre and dogmas the devil all right they don't have Satan's answer right they don't have Satan's answer amen but you and I do there has to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it making that church live move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to just polish the hubs amen we stopped here this morning the token the blood the Covenant blood is not recognized without the token the word assures us of that promise the token is the sign the purchase has been made for us full obedience to the full word of God entitles us to that token all right the fullness of that token not just that nobody had the token till the end time now there is a quote where he said that but you know he's not saying that that there was no new birth I just told you there have been Methodist bride there was Pentecostal bride and when I say bride that means holy ghost in the soul that means a new birth bride and New Birth go together all right foolish virgin and Bri and foolish virgin and New Birth don't go together right so there's a difference anointing does not go with us we have indwelling right no other way is there that you could ever be entitled to the Token until you fully obey the word not what somebody has put into it and added to it but what God said about it Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace and of the hearer now look and grieve not the holy spirit of God now how you griev him go back up to verse 29 the corrupt communication proceeding out of your mouth amen that's right will grieve the holy spirit amen whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption of the of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger clamor evil speaking be put away from me that sounds like the statute of perfect man to me doesn't it to you and be kind one to another oh that's up every brotherly kind kindess tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you possession the enemy's Gates 1959 the holy spirit is so timid that's why there's Church order that's why there's order of a service that's why we don't let the kids run around in the in the out here and and and you know for those of you that don't know it brother Dell set this up long time ago that between Services we do have a short period of time but if you want to practice your songs you've got to 1:30 to practice right sister Esther you got to 1 at 1:30 I don't care you cut it off you be quiet service music turns on brother random comes on and you sit down there's no and I don't mind you talking around during that time because you have to have what key is that or what verse you want to sing that's fine all right but when 1:30 comes that's a designated time that we're going to pray and run the and run the sound um or the singing and then start settling down so see that's order what if one brother oh yeah you know just practice right till 2:00 that's okay don't worry about it well that's not right not according to what the prophet said so there's an order and the Holy Spirit is timid because of that order how many knows that just real timid the Holy Spirit just a little Interruption bothers him remember he would say he would say hey sit down all them Pentecostals you know they were sitting there going I want to run I want to jump I want to shout and a lot of them did get up and speak in tongues and he allowed it for a while and he finally he said hey shut up what about a man in a Pentecostal Congregation of a few thousand and they build everything on that speaking in tongues that woman jumps up starts speaking in tongues he said sh out and shut up oh my word well you know there's a bunch of Pentecostal didn't ask him back no more I'll promise you that but he said you're out of order there's an order Church order and Doctrine there's a whole big book of it in there couple of tapes so let's continue on but that's why there is order it's because the Holy Ghost is timid and you know what else too now watch the Holy Ghost is pleased with the word of God being brought in its time and season but he's not if there's not the Holy Spirit cannot stand if if listen if Jesus and the Holy Ghost and the father of the same person when we go to Revelations 14 I mean Revelations 2:14 where he says I hate that doctrine of the nicians that's the Holy Ghost talking right amen that may be Jesus but it's the Holy Ghost talking now Jesus is not standing here today in flesh he has sent back to what let's have some participation sent back to what hly GH oh so he sent back the Holy Ghost and he's very timid so he ain't going to put out with false Doctrine amen that's why brother B said if you're preach if your pastor is preaching false Doctrine what' he say do he said that's the only reason you can leave go to the brother talk to him if you want to but that's the only reason you can leave not just go brother Aaron can't s Our Sister Sarah can't play the organ here I get the whole family our Levi can't run the sound board back under I mean the video board back there you can't you leave because the word because if the Holy Ghost is timid and you're sitting there listening to false Doctrine if you got the Holy Ghost we've been through this many times before how many times have you sat in the congregation somebody preach false Doctrine there a little bell goes off something goes hey hey hey hey hey oh oh oh oh what that's the Holy Ghost in you that timid guy that said hey I hate that amen get away from it don't you amen that amen God's not going to amen false Doctrine I'll promise you that that's right just a little point so now in the church ages just for a second then we'll then we'll punch what we're wanting to punch here the bride tree was eat to a stump now we've covered all that we've covered that the the the the the bride went into the ground and all the different things the seed goes in the ground it dies it abides alone but when it comes up it brings forth much fruit that's pretty much your bride tree that was eat down and Joel said I will restore all those years that it was eat well now listen when you came to this earth in your human body and your Humanity you were pretty much Eat You Were Dying [Music] alone without god without Hope born in sin shaping iniquity spouse be mother's wom liar H but one day you were reborn your first birth killed you your second birth gives you life your second birth look where it says laid by the adult Heavenly Father the caterpillar is the feeding stage we went through that metamorphosis a little bit ago but that caterpillar was the feeding stage but look that caterpillar could do this amen but he was eating but he could just badly move and he looks up and he goes man I'd like to be up there that's where the good nectar there is but there's something inside of me and something inside of me that's at least pulling me toward that amen and to me that's in the sanctification stage cuz look when I got San when I went when I went through sanctification that's when all that junk left me it wasn't when it at the Holy Ghost it was when all the junk all the stuff I used to do that I love to do I didn't do them no more why I was feeding on the word of God I was packing in something that had not been packed in before I was eating good food solid food then something inside of me began to change amen so the pupa stage is the transition stage there's your new birth that's when you come forth you're getting ready to come forth your cells grow rapidly man this thing is good I love it everything's all right but now remember you got to come to an adult stage Go kids don't have kids amen everybody understand what I'm saying children don't beget children parents adults beget children all right so we come to the adult stage which is the reproductive stage what are we doing right now we are reproducing Jesus Christ and the only way to reproduce him is to go through that right there that's right cuz that is him that is is that man Christ Jesus that we love so much he's standing right there like we do have a picture somewhere where he's standing in that pyramid amen him being the head that controls all of it so we're looking for maturity at full restoration stage where you look like your parent where you look like Jesus Christ not only your Earthly parents Jesus Christ each stage is different serves a purpose purp at each stage and we know that for a fact justification has a purpose and a in a place sanctification has a purpose in a place the new birth and then what then the growth development then the opening of the word comes and we should we should thank God that we're in that part that we're not just coming to church like brother Andrew said are you are you just coming to church because it's because it's repetition are you coming today to hear something that you've never heard before you say I've heard you preach this sermon like Michelle steaman said she said I've heard Danny preach that 15 times but you know what wasn't for her am it was for all them young kids that was in there they' never heard it before right all right so let's break this down we know what metamorphosis is so let's start with the soul just for a few minutes bear with me in just a little bit okay when we get to the soul th this is the this is the real you the center of you that is where everything emanates as far as you you being a a human being to be a human being you have to have a soul so brother Brown said the soul is the real you there's no transmigration of souls there's no there's no uh as some would say that you know um I've got another personality I'm I'm 12 different people well we probably are but but not in your soul right cuz listen on the day of judgment that person that thinks they got 12 personalities they ain't 12 people people going to stand at the day of judgment one and they going to stand there for letting them 12 demons get in them right just to be blank amen second Peter 1 verse2 now watch here we are this is the statute of perfect man scripture so so help me here just for a second all right give me a little Grace Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord now this is Peter getting ready to tell us how to get to and through the statue of a perfect man all right according as his Divine divine power all right divine power there's only one person Divine and there's only one person with divine power right so that's God that's the Holy Ghost that's Jesus Christ in spirit form everybody with me hath given unto us H all things that pertain unto life and godliness in other words our life and how to live a Godly life through the knowledge now what through we got to go through that to understand him through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises listen just to get the new birth you get a lot of promises just get the new birth there's so many promises eternal life you're my child you get to live in the city Hallelujah all right there's all kind of promises but listen there's some more checks in that check but amen there's more chance where're B giv un us exceeding great and precious promises that by these brother R said these promises you might be what partakers possessors amen of that divine nature that's not the nature of the devil amen that's a divine nature of God we can partake of that that's right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust to me if you just stopped all scripture right there we'd be all right amen but that's not our mandate that's right right that's not all of it but that does get you in the Kingdom that does get you right here everybody look at me can you see my finger it don't get you right here that's something one brother said a little while ago he said he said he said U you add faith I said no Faith's not an ADD brother BR said you're born again at Faith that's right and then you add light went off he never been taught that before having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust in other words if you're born again today you have Escape damnation period you might have to go through hell you might I mean not that hell but hell on Earth you might have to go through a lot of things but you're not going to go to judgment you're not going to go through the tribulation and you're going to get to live in that beautiful square mile 1500 square mile city called the future home everybody with me all right so that's wonderful for the promises but you know why God don't want you to just get these and do like I said go sit in the chair and close the door and I'm a Child of God I made it no you just got started you just got started all right so now Romans 8:14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the son sons of God God calls you answered all right for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit now remember that is not that puts you in line for adoption but it doesn't adopt you because your adoption is different from your new birth all right everybody with me listen you can be born again and not be adopted but you can't be adopted and not be born again all right everybody with me but you have received the spirit of adoption in other words what you have lined yourself up in the right family because as brother Dell said years ago I like everybody quoting him that's good but he said he said Satan will not I mean God will not uh accept or adopt God's children I mean Satan's Children amen they're not his that's right they're not even in the family Satan's kids are different and they decided to be that amen all right but you have received the spirit of adoption in the line whereby you cry baby you cry daddy daddy Abby is daddy father father the spirit itself now look beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then AES what we're in the family now we get the reading of the will and it gives you something amen and join ours with Christ cuz he's one that didn't bring our inheritance he made a way to get us back to that inheritance all right join HS with Christ if so be that what that it's just a bell of roses and it's party all the time cake and ice cream your favorite nope if it so be that we what suffer with him why is this happening to me don't ever ask that if you're a Christian don't ever ask that that's right say God what's next God what's next there's something you said you'd never leave me or forsake me you said you never see there's the promises you're in the family open up hey hey amen open up the will the will says this is what you get cuz his will is is and we come on Sunday to listen to our will being read to tell us what we got and what we don't got don't you when you have a will you write down what you given your heirs right right or not for those of you that are a little little little naughty you're not going to get as much and children than HS HS of God and joy HS with Christ so whatever he got you got all right if so be that we suffer with him look that we may be glorified together all right 1 Peter 2 ver1 says wherefore laying aside all malice and all G you see there's a lot of baggage you got to get rid of just to get born again see we're talking about this this is a higher order you need to get rid of this when you're a Christian when you first get started you may fail come on you may fail you're going to fail let me put it that way you're going to fail amen wherefore laying aside all malice all G hypocrisies envies and evil speaking as newborn babes all right babies crying AB a father right desire the sincere milk of the word so if you're he today we going to get a little milk but we're going to get a little meat all right we serve a seven course meal I thought ain't that right but ye may that you may what grow grow thereby if so be you have eat you can't taste something unless you put it in your mouth oh that that's a that's a cheesecake right there buddy you like cheesecake telling you if if y'all ever get hungry before church go raid Michael's um he pays his people to come to Sunday school he pays them with cookies and crack and all kind of stuff but if you just put something like I was telling you before jun's got this we got this Hunter soap which is I mean it smells like dirt and don't look like dirt cuz it's liquid but it smells just like dirt so what am I saying I'm saying you can be fooled by what you see all right but when you taste that you'll know real quick that ain't Earth that's soap right and if it looks like cake it may not be cake but but if you taste of it say man that is the best and then whatever what it is that you taste your taste buds give you and that's same way with the gospel amen if you have tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as into a living Stone disallowed indeed of men what they hate it but chosen of God and precious brother R says why I think Pentecost fails that when a man is born again the spirit of God God gives him a checkbook all right now we're going to start with this checkbook now remember this checkbook is blank all with Jesus's name on it and he's going to give it to you right here right all right whatever heaven's got don't worry never go bankrupt whatever heaven's got whatever every promise has got Jesus has already signed his name so he said hey I'm going to back this up amen cuz you're a baby though I'm going to make sure you don't write it to the wrong person or you write it to yourself amen so I'm going to make sure that my name's on here cuz you got to come to me to see what's in there you got to come to my will you got to read my will all right God gives him a checkbook when you're born again of the spirit of God he gives you a checkbook that'll last him look all through life's journey Amen brother way I've been Christian for 50 years I ain't another check in that book no you ain't wrote enough right amen you ain't wrote enough and at the bottom of each check has got Jesus's name signed to it and you just fill it out for any Redemptive blessing it's yours already paid for now surely you're not afraid that it won't be cashed if you're afraid you're just going to hold a book in your pocket no get it out and write it remember write it for big things amen I I believe you know you and you and me probably have a checkbook with a limit or a credit card with a limit sorry brother John wherever you at there's a limit to this there's no limit right you ride it for 65 billion gazillion trillion dollars and God's like that all that all write it for big things amen cuz he has took your soul he's burned out that old nature and he now resides and happy to reside in you amen God's not happy with me he may not be happy with you in your spirit realm but he's never been a day he's not happy with you in your soul amen remember it's Faith or doubt it's not faith and doubt it's Faith or doubt one's been driven out and the other one stays one or the other everybody with me that's why I said if you'll realize your soul brother how his soul his Soul was just as young as he is right now amen cuz that molding took place at his new birth molding not molding molding of the person took place at the new birth that picture that God saw of him before time before there was even a fall brother God took a picture and he's got this album he puts it right there and he's like this is the way I look at God God says that's all I see right I can hear your voice on Earth come on brother Brown said God don't see your face he said he hears your voice to the blood that's what the prophet said all right and I can understand that because brother Mar said one second in front of God as a human you're dead that's why he was even scared to death when the angel of the Lord which wasn't God himself it was an angel sent from God he said he'd Shake amen cuz it was a spiritual being that was higher than him right okay so he looks at that picture and of course God don't have time so he said he'll be back in a minute he'll be back in a minute y'all like that song uh you know if you see somebody that's that's passing away say hey I'll see you in the morning a Christians only sleep for one night I don't care how long you've been dead in this side you've only been asleep for one night amen cuz what happens in the morning Resurrection amen so he looked at brother how he said he he couldn't didn't he sure he as brother how was going through his life he could hear him Lord Jesus forgive me Lord save my soul oh got you there you are all right you're my child just keep going oh you made a mistake okay all right what mistake that instant that instant he's forgot about it amen so now we come up to yesterday and guess what happened he sends an angel this ain't a fairy tale that's right he sends an Angel that's been with him in that other dimension all his life and he says all right you can step across over there and get him cuz he's going to meet you the body's got to stay over there cuz see it can't go through this Dimension there's a there's a gap there's a what did what did Lazarus what did um Lazarus and the Rich Young Ruler he said there's a great Gulf fixed in other words there's a place that I can't get to you and you can't get to me there's something there all right it's called a dimension or a dimensional wall but when brother Hal passed away they didn't need to have to open the door for him to get out that's right he just that quick boom and like sister Esther said uh in her uh in the what'sapp yeah God's so gracious because you don't understand you never died before you don't understand so he sends somebody brother Tatum or or your dad anybody that's that knows brother how grew up with him he said he'll send them to the river hip you AC cross when you break from that Dimension into this one and that Angel's going wait a minute I'm the death angel said wait a minute now I'm supposed to take him somewhere yeah and and and the Angel's been with him all his time he no he's right where he's supposed to be well I'm supposed to take him over here into this fifth no not that one no that one's special well you see that light around him we're going over here for a little bit and that actually that angel disappears into that sixth Dimension with brother how and with all the other Saints just disappears back into that Dimension and they're waiting there brother Mike Canada and all the different ones all the ones that's passed here they all knew each other listen if you knew if you knew them here you going to know him there brother M said look death doesn't do but one thing changes your dwelling place right does it change who you are so I'm telling all of you and I'm going to tell you just like I told somebody the other day if you have harbored feelings or if you have something you have a problem with with somebody you better get it right or you going to carry it over there and then it over there may not be where you want to go I'm telling you brother R said it changes your Dwelling Place not your person amen get rid of everything you will not carry harbored feelings in the sixth Dimension you will not carry animosity in the sixth dimension that's right you might carry it in another one you're going to go to but you're not going to carry to the sixth one amen so let's look at this real quick is everybody okay we're all right just for a minute I want to get the spirit real because now look we the soul the soul is what sealed in done finished it's going what sealed until the day of its Redemption sealed until full Redemption sealed until even though this body gets so weak I was looking at dad the other day he was he was 6'3 I mean Terence is a little bit taller his but I was you know right at 6 foot and Daddy was always you know y'all too he was this tall picked him up the other day and he was shorter than me why the TOs of Life arthritis your bones get to pushing together you get weak in your in your flesh you bend over I thought oh God that ain't the real hym that real H's 6' three right amen so we going to ask God to restore him back to 6'3 H wait a minute on this side yeah okay cuz you look at that and you see that you know how the Earth because you know what's happening sin is pulling you back into the Earth it's pulling you you got a downward pull even in this but now see your soul though is an upward pull so as soon as this as we're not going to read it tonight but as soon as this body goes there's another one waiting now really remember there's not one hanging up in a closet there's not one walking around going I hope that guy on Earth will hurry up and get here I've just waiting been waiting on him all my life no you take who you are that body that Tabernacle you're making inside of you at the moment that's right if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting where is it it's inside of you and it just goes into another dimension leaves the shell here leaves the leaves the caterpillar it all dries up goes away dies but guess what caterpillar comes out all right look now let's go to the spirit real because look second Peter 1 verse5 it would be wonderful to just stop right here and go hey this is good uh right here this is wonderful where by our given us exceeding great and precious Promises by these promises we're partakers of the divine nature of God having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust in other words you're not going to go to the to the white Throne judgment you're not going to have to be in a tribulation period that would be wonderful but wait a minute we got to get to verse five verse five says and besides this that's verse 1 2 3 4 this is verse 5 and besid this now let's go to the this right here that's called a spirit realm the person you live with besides your soul the attributes let's just put it that way the attributes cuz the soul is the nature of the spirit brother Brown said all right so now Spirit realm what is that memory reason conscious affection imagination that's kind of what you live in most of your time and you know what because of sin Satan is able to get into those five outlets and play right all right play cuz if you're a Christian he's not playing he's just there for I mean he's just playing he's just there for a second he's just playing around right but when now Satan owns your soul he's got your spirit realm too all right but that's where the Battle Is Over remember Black Dog white dog Chief why you have problem he said oh when me get born again after he said me have War me have white dog black dog well what it was it was the white dog in his soul and the black dog was out in the spirit real it wasn't both of them in there the same time fighting cuz what he does is he said well which one I feed the most the memory the reason the conscious affection the imagination I'm feeding them and I'm going to really burden what's inside of me or we're going to do what we're going to take this statue of perfect man and we're going to release all that right and besides this all right you with me giving all diligence get off the couch hold on get out of the baby pen right M [Music] mama right kind of funny but that's kind of way we are sometimes as a Christian Daddy I thought the Bible said come boldly I thought them checks was written to where you can write whatever you I mean give you where you can write whatever you want to all right but now we're going to get to a place though that now listen we're going to get to a place where God said hey I trust you I'm GNA give you the whole checkbook you got the bank and the checkbook and if you need something if I'm not if not if I'm not around if you can't find me just write just write your own name there just write your own name it'll be just as good as my name amen now he's not going to do that right here though can I Rite a check no no you cannot and that's the way we are hello somebody and that's the way we are God don't give you something looking through the but when you become mature though and God don't give you something you say Okay Lord I understand now there's something else coming better than what I asked for see the difference cuz when you was a baby when you a baby in Christ you say man I I I I need my healing I need my healing then God says you need to hang on a minute cuz I'm going use that trial as a blessing and you say Okay Lord whatever it is be it unto me according to Thy word she didn't have to she didn't have to listen to a chemist tell her how that God was going to plant a sperm and an egg in her womb and she not known a man she just had one question and finally after he answered that question he said she said be it unto me according to Thy word all right so let's get to the spirit realm just for a second sorry to go over a little bit besides this giving all diligence add to your faith so look faith is not an ad faith is the new birth all right add to your faith that's why we're going to see brother R talks about seven ads now look 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven8 you see that one two three if faith is an ad if faith is not an if it's something you have to add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even eight but now if you add to your faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 you're right in line to where you're supposed to be all right besides this giving all diligence add to your faith see it now it's become transferred it's not God's faith is yours amen huh it's not God's faith anymore sure add to your faith virtue and take virtue and add knowledge to it take knowledge and add Temperance to it Temperance patience patience godliness God brotherly kindness we've been through this whole thing but we haven't got to that charity part yet and brotherly kindness charity now hold on hold on that's the ad that's the building of the person all right everybody with me but you haven't come to full adoption yet right so now let's read what this Spirit realm will give us Ephesians 4 verse1 14 that we henceforth be no more d yall like when I do that don't you I practiced that a lot that we asked you that we henceforth be no more children look tossed to and fro amen and carried about with every wind of Doctrine well I'll go over here to this Camp cuz it looks better oh I see that a't right let me go over here oh they got a weit down on their group we're going back over here by the slide of man preachers and cunning craftiness whereby look they preachers liy and weight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ 1 Peter 2 vers1 said you also as Lively Stone see look think of these These are Lively Stones cuz what is a stone a stone is a revelation amen right a stone is a revelation listen these are Revelations of Jesus Christ nature that you've got to get that you as Lively Stones wait a minute hold on lively right yeah you as Lively Stones look are built up a spiritual house so we're building a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone which is what right here we're looking at starting our journey building the great Foundation Building to The Headstone which looks exactly the same as the corner all right everybody with me just for a minute because I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be look at that word confounded amen you won't be confused if you'll get it right listen get the right foundation unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them that which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed in other words what did the builders disallow the head amen this was rejected this wasn't because this has been this listen this is what happened in the church ages he was a Cornerstone he was the Son of God the one that resided in their soul but you had a lot of babies in this group that stayed babies that didn't grow especially the ones in here cuz he had to restore back to where brother Bram could come right here and zerubabel had to build the temple again all right unto you therefore which believe he is precious but un them which be disobedient the stone which the Builder disallowed the same is made the head down here of the corner but now look what it becomes it becomes a stone of stumbling a rock of offense offense even to them which stumble look at the word amen what being disobedient listen if you're not doing this you are disobedient even though you're born again you can be a disobedient child that's right even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereinto also they were appointed there's some people not going to make it all the way up to Statue of perfect man but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should what show live walk the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people you were scattered everywhere believing everything and whatever you wanted to and some of you didn't even believe nothing but now you've been brought into a place not just this building but into a place the message of the hour the the truth of the message of the Bible now which times past were not a people but are now the people of god wow he just put you in another group listen when God puts you in a group glorify it when man puts you in a group don't just disallow it but when God puts you in a group be happy with it he's put you in a place called bride that's right which had look which had not which had not obtained Mercy but now listen it's the merciful grace of God that you get these virtues working in your life amen but now have obtained Mercy 1 Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren we've read this before see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently Being Born Again In other words going through the sanctifying process again get remember them remember the uh the vision getting out all the trash the trash was the trash trash was coming out here not down here trash was coming out right here remember he was pouring in the water it come out trash and sticks and all that was running out of me and you being born again not of corruptible seed but have incorruptable by the word of God which liveth and biteth forever Hebrews 5:10 says called of God a high priest after the order of mzd of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing that you're dull of hearing you know you know what he's telling him he said you really don't understand this mezic person am but brother B never said that that's right you should never say that who is this mdic if you read that book or listen to that tape you'll find out who mdic is amen of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing you hadn't been taught or you either shut your mind off right for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age what up here full age even those who by reason of use have their senses memory reason conscience affection imagination have your senses exercised to discern good and evil amen fans 1:4 says now look we're still in the spirit realm we're still getting rid of all that stuff in our spirit realm the memory reason conscious affs and Imagination according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love thank God that's what he said about us having predestinated us unto the adoption so now we got in the right family we know where the will is am we we we do have a uh um um a better view of our will let's just put it that way we have a better view of our will we know even what between the lines of the will is we know what he's want to give us even though he didn't put in plain language amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ what two to himself according to the good pleasure of his will not yours adoption series brother R said look we'll stop right here I won't get into adoption because adoption we'll talk about placing we'll talk about the checkbook we'll talk about all the things about adoption what is adoption now let me get this now I don't know musicians go and come on I won't have time to get through this but I'll hit it then if there's a question you ask me a little later in the message your adoption is not your birth amen all right your adoption is your placing we've talked about being born again receiving the divine nature of God getting you into the family of God and then receiving the benefits of being in the family by the reading of the will by your senses being exercised in the right way not the wrong way but your adoption is your placing when you were born again John 1:17 I believe when we were born again of the spirit of God we are sons of God but we were predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get to for this sons of the last day us we were predestinated unto adoption so what is adoption adoption is your placing it's giv you Authority it's giv you power more power than you've ever got in your whole entire life but you know how to use it let's stand to our feet we'll talk about adoption cuz see in second Peter 1:8 we we read 2 Peter 1 verse all the way down to 7 that tells us we got the divine nature of God that we need to add these virtues and look this is the benefit I'm going to read this and then this is where we'll start next time I I preach next Sunday second Peter 1 ver8 looks for if these things be in you what if these things all right divine nature of God right receiving these virtues all right what's it going to give you what's the promise that you're going to get when you get all these virtues working in your life for if these things things be in you now this is a continuation add to your faith virtue but knowledge Temperance patience God for if things be in you and abound overflow not just a trickle Niagara Falls for if these things be in you and abound they make you I like that word make because at this time God's going to if you come to that place of adoption you're going to be made to do some things right cuz humanly you don't want to do a lot of these hello amen that's the fight but when we turn oursel completely over to God these things are going to make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see what a far Revelation cannot understand Revelation and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins let's don't be that way I don't care if you've been born again for 40 or 50 years let's don't get away from that let's don't forget where we came from wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence he says that word diligence a lot to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things what does that say you afraid of falling you want to take a promise of God even with a checkbook with Jesus's name on the bottom let's write that check right there it says if you do these things you shall never fall amen then we'll talk about this for an entrance shall be ministered unto you in other words there's an open door in this age that came by a prophet in the end time down to a five-fold Ministry to get a people ready to get us in that door that door of the Statue of perfect man for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you and abundantly into unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be NE negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things 131 sermons right right wherefor kind of like Paul wherefore I no I'm not wherefore I will not be negligent to put you off always in remembrance of these things amen though you know them and be established in this present day truth amen that's you that's me that's the promises that and from you read second Peter 1 through about whatever 12 you ought to have a you ought to have a Shou in time amen cuz it promises you'll never fall you'll have abundant Everlasting Kingdom you'll be called and elected you'll never fall you got an entrance into the Everlasting kingdom of God if you like him though you're blind and you can't see it far off forgotten when he was purged from his old sins for these things be in your bound that make you you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ let's sing a song God bless you sorry it took a little bit longer but had to get to this point anyway
