Eyes of My Heart I live foreign thank you glorious any man that's ever been spiritual and breathed the breath of any kind at all right has always wanted a theme is that right you know brother Ram said we've come into complete realization in this hour we've come face to face with him because we have the fullness of the word he's been totally identified in our midst is that right and so we appreciate that it's just a this message uh there's there's nothing that makes me happier than to be able to be with people that believe this message to be able to discuss it I never have any problems with any of you to just be open and say what I can say it's just it's just a wonderful atmosphere where there's two or three gathered together in his name and you can just talk about the message it's just a it's just we're going to be talking about it over there by the way it's not a little stop here this is this is we're going to keep having these these fun times if you would let's turn in our description I want to take off real quick my focus is going to be on the Feast of trump who wasn't here this morning somebody here now that wasn't here this morning okay brother just I'm gonna take off quick so if I lose you so I apologize okay I hope you watched that video okay well you're a good shape then so let's go to Leviticus 22 3 or 23 2 again I just want to reestablish for the people might be looking in and hear that these seven feasts were not Israel's feasts they're the Lord's feasts okay that's what I want to just re redo it the scripture Leviticus 22 3 2 speaking of the children of Israel and saying to them concerning the feasts of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim you've got to preach these you understand to be holy holy Gatherings even these are my feasts these are the feasts of the Lord even holy Gatherings convocations which ye shall preach in their season right remember Brotherhood said you had to be spiritual food in due season I can take I can take over 50 titles of the message from 63 to 65 and place them in these same seven piece right it really Brethren remember the quote once weekly he read in the book of Exodus because brother Graham a lot of what he got was out of the book of Exodus right which in itself Brethren called it a book of redemption is that right so let's bow our heads if you would dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word we thank you that you've revealed these things to us in this hour Lord there's none of us worthy Lord but you made us worthy and we give thanks to you o God be with us in this service give us a revelation there's nothing more important no higher thing even healing the greatest thing you'll know is a Salvation of your soul and how are you saved by grace are you saved through faith through a revelation greatest thing you can give us oh God and we give you thanks for the Revelation o father in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated I want to go I told the brother I wanted to go at the bottom of that page six I think it was quoting recognizing your day as message and I I just want to grab the Pentecostal Feast one more time because there was a chart I found out on the internet and this chart everybody heard of Kabbalah which is the mystical part of Judaism and that doesn't scare me things like that do you know you're the mystical body of Jesus Christ so you know when I use the word mystical it doesn't bother me you got to be careful because there's fanaticism do you know there's fanaticism in the message he said the great thing about Luther is he didn't get a fanaticism his day what you got around the message is you got people who are become fanatics they don't have a balance Fanatics don't have a balance do you understand so we need to have a balance in the word in the quotes in our everyday life we need to have balance right so we need to understand let's read this one it says uh my subject this morning is recognizing your day and its message remember that's part of the Pentecostal Feast remember counting the Omer you had to know the day you're on we see from last Sunday's lesson as we talk the Feast of the trumpets and I want to call your attention now the time of Israel in God's timepiece we are dealing today up on a Sunday school lesson that I want you to realize and recognize the times that we're living in so you as part of your Pentecostal experience you need to know what day you're living in you need to know are you 21 steps away from when he rose are you at the 50 you understand so I'm gonna I'm gonna show you by the quote of the message where we're at we're just about to run out as you see and then by this you should know the very hour and time and sign and message that you are to receive look brother man preached what Paul preached but I'm not in the days of Paul right yeah everybody understand exactly Paul polls we have received a token message at this hour and it's the message that was given by the mighty Angel does everybody agree with that like I told them down there the token for irenius day was the message that God gave irenius right and people that fell under that token are under that message they're going to come up at the Rapture because to be able to Exodus out you have to have a token so every day they had a token message it might have been Luther was only part word the judge that that's the part that God gave in that day and they stayed true to Luther's message so they're going to come up do you understand they stayed under their messenger that just didn't apply to this age that applied to every day the people in Israel coming out had to stay under Moses did they yeah they did Paul they had to stay under him in his hour you have to stay under this message in this hour is that right Glory okay let's go to that chart now that's this I went off the internet and I was looking because what they did Israel they went for the Feast of first fruits they were 50 days and then Moses got up on this mountain so they took 49 days you see this right here 49 and when he went up there they put Revelation there now I'm going to explain something you know what he got on that mountain the revelation of all right did he right see we look at the law and we think well that's the law no it was the revelation of the law before that they had no law right did they no they'd have no law did they right so on that 50th day they received they've come to the Apex God's going to give them a reason for taking them out he's going to give them a revelation you see here what this most important thing is for the Jews you see why the law had so much emphasis on them because they fell under the revelation of the law but when the revelation of Grace had come they couldn't come out of that dispensation right right they couldn't turn the corner could they they said we have Moses in our Prophet we have Abraham as our father and Moses had already warned them there's going to be one like an unto me exactly and if you don't hear him you're going to be cut off from among the brethren right everybody agree with that right so Moses went up here and he got the Revelation The Ten Commandments right does everybody agree with that right man on the 50th day now let me show you I'm going to show you and I'm going to move on real quick okay he come down when he come down the preachers had built some golden calves down at the bottom they hadn't even received the Revelation yet right without the Revelation they're down here building the calf of gold and they got the people dancing naked around it remember I told you this morning they stripped the preachers stripped them off right they didn't have a revelation you don't have a revelation you're naked you'll be dancing around a calf you understand what I'm saying just pure and simple he comes down off the mountain he hears some noise at the bottom of the mountain what's going on they've made a golden calf Moses got so mad he threw down the law and broke it before he could give the Revelation he got the Revelation but he got so mad he broke it is that right so Moses what he did was Moses said he told the people he said you know what I will atone for you yeah you know it really struck me when I was reading through Exodus that bro that stood out Moses said I will atone right Moses didn't say he's going to offer a bull a goat or nothing and he didn't go read it Moses said I will atone for you no wonder Moses said there will be a prophet like unto me that'll atone for you right does everybody see what I'm saying so what happened was after that some days later he went up on a mount God went up there and Moses said he stood in the breach did he not or God would have destroyed him did Jesus stand in a breach amen or God would have destroyed him is that right and he says I will provide an attack I will atone for you Moses went up and pleaded before God God said get away Moses I'm going to destroy the whole lot down there he said you can't take me if you're going to destroy them take me right right and brother had said I couldn't understand how a man could stand in the face of God have enough boldness is a Christ in him by the way and say I will atone for him that's I thought that was big when I read it right I will atone he didn't say a bull ago he said I will do you agree with that amen so the Lord said okay go down off the mountain I'm going to direct you to another Mountain everybody understand what I'm saying and that that amount was signing eye right man he said I'm going to direct you to another Mount which is Mount Horeb so they took another Journey over to there Moses went back on the mountain again he was given the law again does everybody understand that when he went on the mountain you know what the Lord told him I forgive them yeah so the atonement that second Mountain he went on was atonement so you have what look remember the the feast days is it was Feast of Weeks you got feast and after after he come down off the mountain when he went back up and said I will atone God started pouring plagues down one bottom of the mountain did he not what did Brother Adam say the seven feasts were plagues right right what were the plagues to do Drive Israel back to their Homeland after they refused they got into their troubled at the bottom of the mountain he broke the law the next thing Moses went up here to tone for him now God didn't accept him yet until he got on the other Mountain and he started plaguing Israel so I say you had to Feast the Pentecost where he went up to get the Revelation which they goofed up before he came down God starts sending plagues on him does everybody agree with that then he goes into the atonement a few days later when on the mountain does everybody understand that and he said you know what okay I'll I'm gonna go look at it he said I'm a God it's merciful to the fourth generation he goes on and says how merciful he is is that right so what he did he came to atonement does everybody agree with that so he came to atonement he came back down the mountain and gave the people the tablets right so the atonement was when God accepted you right it's not good enough that you have but justification saying you've got to have the atonement the atonement is when God accepts your sacrifice and Moses was put himself a Living Sacrifice I believe that's where Paul got it I believe Paul which the Old Testament and said what in the world he said he didn't offer a bull or goat he offered a Living Sacrifice Moses offered himself that's pretty you think that ain't strong right right but go look I want you I don't have time to read it I broke it down for our church and went all through it but he I I'm still amazed at that I see why brother man said I'm amazed that Moses could stand in the face of God and then tell the people I will atone for you all right that's that's big isn't it that's what happened do you agree so they had to Feast the Pentecost then they had plagues and the plagues drove them to Mount Horeb right now come on go read it it's exactly what I'm saying in the Bible okay and the feast days are the same let's go to the next let's go where we're starting on uh but I just wanted to bring you that chart now we're going to hit the Feast of atonement this is a little chart I put together and we'll come back to it maybe to sum it up if not it'll be on the internet go look at it it'll do you good okay so get it past this let's go to the first quote here we go speaking of the children of Israel saying in the seventh month in the first day of the month so you have a Sabbath a memorial the blowing of trumpets now I'm going to tell you something there's no scripture other than one scripture an entire Bible you can say it's seven trumpets if you go look at the Feast of trumpets as a chauffeur did everybody know that the Ram's Horn right right well the Feast of trumpets they blew a Ram's Horn but brother Brandon comes down in the Book of Revelation says it was seven trumpets there's only one place in the scripture and it's in Revelations that Associates the Feast of trumpets with seven trumpets only one and the scripture don't tie it back to it brother Branham does yeah that's why you've got to have a prophet or you'll never you'll never be able to get this a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word right you think you can make it without this Prophet you're kidding yourself amen you have to receive a God will reveal if he's going to reveal a secret thing he was three he'll reveal it unto his servant the prophets come on is that right brother is the only one ever anywhere go to the anywhere that ties the Feast of seven the Feast of trumpets to seven trumpets all right you agree exactly you've read it you know I'm telling you the truth okay here we go Feast of trumpets now the Feast of trumpets now this was a gathering of Israel brother have said the trumpet's whole purpose doesn't gather Israel back to their Homeland right right quote verbatim right right where they gathered together the Feast of the trumpets listen as a minister of the Gospel I can't see one thing left but the going of the bride and the bride has to be taken away before they can recognize what happened right before the Jews will recognize their atonement we got to get out of the way we're holding the whole thing up people remember I told you the these religious things are totally determined on the moon the church you see it is it's a fact okay they were bound scattered I mean they were scattered blinded and now gathered Israelis thought about what's left the bride to be taken out of the way waiting for the going of the rights so their prophets of Revelation 11 can tell it can call them to the Feast of the trumpet right it's trumpets you know what I mean but actually it's trumpet right right he's right that's not a wrong statement that doesn't say Feast of trumpets Brother Francis Feast to trumpet right right you just look at that you say no he's wrong no he's right I'll I'll prove it to you I can prove it to you in Matthew yeah there are two angels that sounded but it was one trumpet exactly do you agree does it say in Matthew 24. I got him in all these notes that I'm never going to get to so I'm going to have to just say it and you're gonna have to go read it okay let's go to the next one oh Daniel's 70 weeks oh yeah listen bring it up though you got okay here's what remember I quoted this morning now where now we're where I'm I'm gonna go wide open on it Revelation 6 1 to Revelation 19 21 is it connected with the 70 weeks you know what Revelation 6 1 is first seal right hey if if you don't get these Daniels say we sure don't get them sealed people don't understand what he said therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain why these 70 weeks because if you don't you'll miss those seals hmm isn't that what 6-1 is first seal right okay you'll miss the trumpets you'll miss the vials those plagues those three unclean spirits like frogs those three woes see when you don't get Daniel 70 weeks you miss a lot of things people like I say this morning if you don't get it take six through 19 and tear it out of your ramble for Revelations it's wasting so what do we got now we got a bunch of preachers around the message who don't even understand Revelation 6 1 to Revelation 19. that's right sad story right I feel sorry for them the casting out of the red dragon the woman in the sun you'll miss it all did he say oh yeah okay all right I've had people say well all I hear Brother Samuel say is Daniel 70 weeks you know what I'm gonna be honest with you guys if you got Spirit of adultery on you every time he preaches all you'll hear is adultery when you come to a point and you don't go any further that's all you hear God's not going to move you beyond that until you take care of that right right you get a preacher and I come out here I preach adultery you have me six months from now I preach adultery six months later I come and preach adultery you know what I got a problem with I got a problem with adultery whatever you preach your preachers all the time that's why that's why you got to preach all of it amen if I get hung up on anyone I'm hung up I'm not moving okay because if you don't okay you'll miss it all if you don't because it takes place right here in this where does it take place 90 of the preachers in a message say we got three and a half years left you can't get all that in in three and a half years I'm not too bright but I'll tell you you can't get all that's happening what he said in this verse you can't get all these things casting the Red Dragon that comes after the two prophets are killed right the seven vials comes after the two prophets are killed the prophets Minister for how long 1260 days three and a half years if you get them if you get them off at three and a half and God don't go on dealing with them how are you gonna get the rest of it in right you see what they're doing they're taking an absolutely cutting scripture out by their revelation of what they think he said that's why I say he meant what he said on his chart three and a half years of Ministry for those two witnesses and another three and a half he calls it Great Tribulation go look at his chart you guys know it so I don't have to just hold it up here in front of you so you mentioned now look because it takes place right here in the 70th week all of it right right all these things take place in the 70s week does everybody agree with that amen well anybody's got a little brain at all can understand what's those two profits are cut off the vials will start falling and see this is my mistake I always thought when brother when when you talk about plagues the vials are plagues but the seven trumpets are the seven plagues that push Israel back to her Homeland right the seven vials is what Falls after the two witnesses are dead this the vials are judgment because I'm gonna be honest with you after that there's nobody to redeem right right right let me make a statement brother bam said when the Gentile bride goes up then we got three and a half year of ministry under those two witnesses he said after the bride goes up there will not be another Gentile Save Right right do you agree amen what's those two three and a half years take place those two witnesses and the hundred and I'll I'll go and live I believe it's 144 000 arrests erected with them if they're going to show up in the Millennium like where'd they resurrect right does that kind of blow you guys away are you okay with that amen where are you going to get the hunter are they going to resurrect at the Millennium right right then you gotta Resurrection spoken there the only thing between the them dying in the streets and res is in two prophets I believe they'll follow their two just like when brother Brown goes up you'll fall right in behind him man did he say it right iridius will go up and his group will fall right in behind him it fits the message for me guys okay I don't lose no continuity with it right so you got you know where I'm at with Daniel 70 weeks I'm I agree with you on that very few people do and then why wouldn't he let me preach the seven trumpets even I was ready to announce it had the holes ready and everything to go into preach the seven trumpets and I said there's something bothering me so bad I said we kept on working and Billy and all of us trying to get ready for the air-conditioned building for this next coming week for the saving trumpets Savvy 10 days or eight days had the school he was going to preach the trumpets just like he did in seals the seals he preached seven days is that right question answers between everybody agree with that that's what he did I told Holy Spirit wouldn't let me do it for some reason exactly I'm going in and sincerely I knelt down for God to pray and he revealed to me that them seven trumpets sounded under the Sixth Seal and I've done preached it supernaturally you want to understand the seven trumpets go read The Sixth Seal exactly is that what he said all seven trumpets were revealed to me under the Sixth Seal right they were open that's what he's saying that's right is anybody okay with what I'm saying here start wagging your head and amen I'm gonna hang up here if you want to hear the rest of the story you better start doing this okay and we picked up under the Sixth ceiling all of you have that how the persecution of the Jews right the six seal what's it seven trumpets persecution of the Jews everybody good with that let's go now you see under the fifth seal we find here martyrdom and I added a quote to this somewhere I think maybe I'll find out when we get to it and under the 24-9 now he's talking about Matthew 24. does everybody understand other six seals the First Brethren brought Matthew 24 in yeah Matthew for 24 there was three questions given right it was Jews asking Jesus about the temple the signing when would the temple be restored or destroyed he said and he made it clear Titus destroyed it in 70 A.D that's finished right so he said when will the temple be restored when will be the sign of thy coming and when will be the end is that the three questions in Matthew 24. amen right we'll see he went away from the Jews he's going back so Matthew 20 I'm going to say this I don't know how Matthew 24 really applies to Israel now there's characteristics and pieces of it we use do you agree does everybody agree with that but but the fullness of Matthew 24 is really to the Jews do you agree because remember it was all about was the temple going to be rebuilt right when's Temple going to be destroyed when is the end going to be is everybody got what I'm saying so brother ran him perfectly under the Sixth Seal placed Matthew 24. and then brother Brandon preaches and shows us where the six seals show up under right Matthew 24. then he preaches Matthew in 24 out of The Sixth Seal all seven trumpets sound under the Sixth Seal exactly brother Branham is placing them perfectly for us he said the trumpets are the same thing to the Jews that the seals are to us everybody okay with that that makes a difference later on right they shall deliver you up to kill you and so forth same seal being open now six seal is the one we're coming to now Matthew 24 29. okay 6 12 through whatever oh man I'm about to Where's My Water somebody can you give me a glass somebody give me a bottle of water it says and you remember the scripture and it's he says it here so I'll just hear immediately after the tribulation of those days what days is he talking about right brother Branham brings in an amateur tribulation or pre-tribulation okay now let's read it what win this tribute this amateur tribulation they went through here see the sun shall be dark and the moon shall not give her light stars shall fall from the heaven the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man right after that right exactly okay and then shall all the tribes the Earth mourn and they shall see now who's the tribes is that us or Israel you ain't a tribe that's Israel right right 12 tribes of Israel so mostly Matthew 24 is to Israel amen but Brethren sees the the type anti-type of it and pulls it out for us right okay Where'd I get to True okay here's what I want immediately after the tribulation of those days remember it says immediately after tribulation that's exactly what it says in Matthew 24. win this tribulation that amortization they went through is here see the sunshine already read that and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven remember I preached here in 1962 those seven planets lined up that was the sign of the son of man I preached a year before sign of Aquarius right which is son of man did it happen after that the tribulation of those days what tribulation is talking about World War II the sixth trumpet and we'll get to it in a minute I'm gonna scatter it I'm gonna bring it back to you here in a bit so I see your looks okay and they shall see the son of man come in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and Glade Glory next quote now I'm going to talk about the first four trouble let's read them let's read the okay and the Seven Angels which had the seven trumpets prepared itself to sound now look this is a comment for me only place you can associate the seven Trump I misspelled it seven trumpets with the Feast of trumpets one scripture in the Bible there you go to the Old Testament put in seven trumpets you know where you'll get it when they went around the city and there were seven Trumpets on the seventh day do you agree right those said that never said seven trumpets associated with the Feast of trumpets right right we don't know how many there were until this hour right without brother Branham you'd have never known the answer to that does everybody got one is everybody with me so far go to the Old Testament and find seven trumpets under the Feast of trumpets and you can't find it that's one of the Mysteries that's been open in this hour what these trumpets really are the first okay I got that yeah first Angel sounded in their fallen hell and fire mingle with blood and they were cast upon the Earth the third part of the trees was burned up all the green grass was burnt in the second Angel sounded as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was cast in The Sea and the third part of the sea became blood third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died in the third part of the ships were destroyed and the third Angel sounded and there felt and her fellow great star from Heaven burning as a lamp and it fell upon a third Heart part of the waters upon The Fountains of the waters and the name of the star is called wormwood he's the angel over water see God's got or Angel's order he got seraphims cherubims wormwood Michael Gabriel and there's order to them right see if you don't have order you got chaos you'll have Angels tripping over Angels right God don't do that he hasn't he said Mr wormwood this is your job you're in charge of the waters right is that right so he gives every Angel a charge of something right that's their job right it's kind of the way we do it in the Work World don't we you come up do somebody else you're doing my job that's not in my job description see God's guide put a job description for these guys too fourth Angel sound third part of the son was Smith in the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars as the third part of them was darkened and the day shown not for the third part of it and the night likewise quote now this calling of the Feast of the Trump is the approaching of something notice Revelation 8 7. if you want it right there's only I went out to the message and I looked up first trumpet second trumpet third Trump a fourth trumpet there's only two quotes you'll find on those four trumpets and I'm gonna read them to you and the only trumpet he talks about is the first trumpet and there's a reason he does it and the scripture will answer why brother random did it okay okay now calling of the feasts notice that Revelation 8 7 you want to write it down we know it's the first trumpet they're scattered hell Blood Fire upon you are just exactly what the Exodus when God was calling his people out of the Exodus now the reason that these seven trumpets does not apply to this church in this age is because it is only it's the calling of the Gathering of the people so the purpose of the trumpets their plagues to gather Israel back to their Homeland now let me let me tell you something go look at the Old Testament when God moved Abraham out off that mountain down into Egypt how did it happen plague a famine hit the land right and he moved down to Egypt tried to give his wife away God all God was doing was trying to set a time right right God knew it was going to happen he just wanted to fulfill his word right God's obligated he's going to set a type for us right so what moved Abraham a plague right you agree right so he went down there and finally got back to the mountain right what moved Israel where they went into bondage for 400 years out of the land to Egypt what moved them plague what moved him out of Egypt back into the promised land right plague when God wants to move Israel he puts a plague on them oh yeah when he wants to move us he's going to let the pressure go right you're gonna get the same thing church folk right Little Eagles you've been with bunny fur in your nest too long God's fixing to turn the bunny fur out and you're gonna go you know what they are thorns underneath there and he gonna put thorns in the bottom of it he'll put you know nice bunny fur in it and you'll sit there fat dumb and happy that's what laodiceans are we're Eagles in a layout of seeing atmosphere and we're just laying there yeah we're not moving we're not doing it God's going to put the pressure on one day you're going to wake up and go you're going to have thorns you know what they do then they jump out of their nests and start flying all right brother said you want to show who you are wait till the pressure comes don't prove who you are you could say you believe this message you could say you have the fullest the word when this pressure comes you're going to prove it then buddy you better not fake it you better get the goods now because when the pressure comes out it's gonna be too late for a lot of you 600 or 200 or whatever but I said scriptures will fulfill the last hours of Jesus Christ we've come to the last hours of the Gentile dispensation God's fixing to pull the bunny hair out you better get the fullest word in you now and now there's only one insignificance in here that I want you to get to in a few minutes is where you'll see why this doesn't apply the age that we're living in the seven trumpets next quote the Gathering of Israel is the trumpets the trumpets gather Israel so we know what the brother said the trumpets are plagues and I I proved it by the Old Testament if he wanted to move me plagued them right he turned a plague on them then they'd move to where he they'd go where he wanted them to go exactly I told the church you deer hunters you got a deer and it's a cornfield he's gonna go down the easiest path to get there until you fire the first shot right first shot fired you made all fired somebody fired it next day you go out there and that deer went 10 days up and down there you said buddy when opening season comes up first day I'm gonna get this Buck you go out there nothing you know why pressure come they had to change what they were doing some of you are going to change the things you're doing when that pressure comes down I'm going to tell you again the bunny hair is coming out and you're going to start flying it's coming brother am said to get rapidly worse now brother brainer is a quote where he said the pressures now I believe I believe it gets I believe it's getting rapidly worse right right if there's going to come an hour where you're not going to be happy sitting in your little nest you're going to get weary of being in this flesh right and if Fords are going to start you're going to say I want even so Lord come quickly that the pressure is what's going to bring you to that point if the pressure draws Israel back to their Homeland the same pressure is going to draw you up you're going to get pressure just count on it okay now I want to show you something here I'm going to say something that's kind of out of my notes but you understand I just read what the four trumpets were right does everybody agree with that I just read them listen oh I don't know if they got the slide there let me read that thing all right what happened was I had all these notes nice and neat my computer crashed two weeks ago I lost them I've tried to rebuild them but I'm not preaching it so I don't I I just threw it together I'm sorry I really feel bad but you know what I was a computer guy for 34 years I told the customer back up back up back up my computer blew and I had six months of notes I lost what an idiot 34 years I appreciate that message the register wouldn't be many preachers make it they preach it can't live it I guess I'm proof of that I.T guy preached it I didn't live it so we're gonna back up that was chapter eight I read in do you agree let's go Jack chapter seven now we understand four trumpets then the fifth then the sixth then the seventh trumpet but he gives the forward is everybody agree that these four trumpets are an interruption in nature go read it right it's trees it's water does everybody agree those first four trumpets are an interruption of water of nature right totally the first four trumpets that's what they are everybody I just read it let's read these quotes go ahead let's read I can say something awful good right here but I guess I'll hold it until tomorrow night see all right and have power now he's talking about the two witnesses and that power of the waters to turn into the blood that's what it says in the first one or within trumpets do you agree I just read it smart deals with plagues as often as they will what is it what can bring these things but the word they can do nature any way they want to here it is they're the one who brings on The Sixth Seal exactly all seven trumpets sound under what seal okay they uncover and open it up it's the power of God to interrupt nature right the first trumpet through the fourth trumpet is the interruption in nature everybody agree with that right they can send earthquakes turn the moon into blood right he and I told him he would get on set you know they talking about these Blood Moons going on do you understand Jesus at the Passover when he's on the Mount of Olives he said his swellwood go read it Saint Luke 22 44. his sweat was as blood right his sweat was not blood what it was there was a blood moon and he was looking into it does everybody got that every time there's a blood moon in Israel something happened significantly in Israel does everybody agree with that we got one coming up April the 29th the pope will be there on that day did you know that there's going to be another eclipse during the day when you get a blood moon what happens is one of those they call them a Treacher while I looked it up there's a black eclipse of the Sun the next day remember Jesus's sweat was blood he was looking at the moon it was a Blood Moon the next day from that what ninth hour to do it was Darkness there was an eclipse that's exactly what's going to happen when the Pope's here now the pope ain't Jesus but God when he deals with Israel there's blood moons when Israel was sent out of Spain during Isabel and ferdinand's Rule they were they were forbidden to be in Spain they put them on ships and what the ship mashed through they'd sell out in the ocean and they told the Jews just what the Germans did pack up all your Earthly possessions they'd put them on the boat those cabins take them out kill them and steal what they had you know what Hitler did he went in and said pack all your belongings everything you want to take with you put them in luggage and come on they get to the death camp they'd take their luggage throw it over here you're going to take a shower and you'll pick it back up well they put all their money in silver and gold in there it just made them easy they didn't have to go to the apartment figure out where they hid it all right that's exactly what they did under Isabella and Ferdinand go read it those Jews died out there they pushed they they said some of them would you know Jews love money they said some of them eat their jewelry and stuff and then cabbage the ship cut them open skin them out like a fish and get the old out of them a Jew is a Jew likes their money people I'm telling you that's why God can't just go to the Jews and say get out of here you gotta drive them out because they love they idle look we'll read it in the next trumpet I'll get on it there's so much I want to get there and I'm you know so we understand it's the interruption there okay right here interval between the six and seventh and seal let's go here right here buddy now now we notice that being just one verse here we'd like to do something just a little a little bit here if you would notice we skipped the seventh chapter so he skipped the seventh chapter right that's under the seventh seal the seventh chapter of Revelations right so he's calling it an interval you agree the six seal the seven seal there's something take between the sixth and seventh chapter okay if you notice the seven chapter we know it's between the six and seven there's an interval an interval between the sixth and seventh chapter book and it's between the sixth and seventh seal right all seven trumpets sound of The Sixth Seal right everybody agree I'll keep you back there that this interval is given now we want to notice this very important that we notice this little time next quote now we notice the interval now between the six and seventh chapter now the seventh chapter Revelation here as it reveals the happening he's going to tell you what that interval is right right right scripture interprets itself it's not in here just for nothing it's putting out not between in between this for nothing it is here for a purpose it's a revelation that reveals something notice how mysterious and how mathematically it fits right into scripture exactly you believe in God's mathematics if you don't you're sure lost what most of them don't believe in God's mathematics with Daniel 70 weeks might as well just you're sure get lost in the word look at what he said I want to tell you I hear message preacher after message preacher after message feature say this and they don't even understand what they're saying right right yeah we're just saying it just quote loader exactly if you start putting a four or six or something beside just the mathematical words running in order you'll sure have in your scene a cow picking grass in the top of the tree somewhere people don't get Daniel 70 weeks are picking they're they got a cat on the tree picking grass is that what he's saying there's something in between here you need to get did Brother Madam say that the trumpets were included in the 70th week now I didn't say that I read it to you earlier did I not the woes did he say it the vials right they don't get Daniel 70 weeks are they the cow picking the grass out of the top of the tree he'll have their picture right do they that's what he's talking about right I don't know how you may think you certainly run out because God does not his whole word does not does run completely in mathematics yes sir perfect the most perfect there's no other literature written like it so perfect in math mathematics next one let's go up thanks and we're going to speak here now in the seventh chapter just a minute to kind of bridge it in between the sixth and seventh seal there's your interval right right he's still talking about your interval listen to kind of bridge it in between the six and seven seal because that's the only material that we have to go on right now is the six between the six and seventh seal is the calling out of Israel amen remember brother Anthony don't get hung up on the seal brother Brahm said the seal is the coming of the Lord it's opening of the word anybody agree with that huh he said it's the end of all things when brother babe talks to seven seal which one of those are you talking about he's talking about between the six and seven he's talking about the end of all things do you understand what I'm saying you've got to understand what brother man says seventh seal which part of that is he talking about that's why he told us even the six seals got three parts to it everybody remember the three parts six seals Redemption it's the redeemed 144 000. the foolish virgin and to purge the Earth and the trumpets are under the Sixth Seal is that what he said so six sealed all it deals with is those three people you agree okay I know you I know you did I better quit picking on you you're the good guy you don't pick one of the guys wearing a white hat okay okay now I have many fine Jehovah Witness friends sitting here it's all or have been maybe some of them let's go down to where it's highlighted I'm gonna be here all day it's not it has nothing to do with the church age at all they're absolutely Israel right now this interval between the six the seals is the calling and ceiling of 144 000 Jews called in a tribulation period after the church is gone see it has nothing to do with the church age at all oh called in perfectly in harmony with the scriptures Daniel's last three and one half years what's he talking about the 144 000 where are they sealed right in the last three and a half years of ministry right he's not talking and saying Daniel 70 weeks only has three and a half years in it there's only three and a half years of redemption in it exactly once those three and a half years are over and it was 144 000 are done and gone there's no Reser there is no Redemption for the Jew just like when we go up in the Rapture There's No Redemption for the Gentiles brother man said once we take the Rapture there will not be another Gentile saved amen they can't come all the way they might come out but they can't go into Redemption has two parts understand what it is so once those Jews get cut off that last three and a half years judgment there ain't nobody going to be saved in that last it's the wrath of God being spewed up on the earth it'll destroy the dead wood that's here if John a man said if a tree's dead cut it down and fire that what do you think God's gonna do it's dead woods they don't breathe the fruit for it right they have no purpose in being here that's tough isn't it all of them at the end of that three inch nothing but cannon fodder right oh called in perfectly in harmony with the scripture Daniel's last three and one free allotted to Daniel's people that's true there ain't gonna be it's three and a half years of redemption redemption's over do you agree the three and a half years Israel's going to start getting judgments they uh right the three and a half years of those two prophets Brethren later on 64 said it he said to them two props so I think they're gonna bring tribulation down on the Gentile once they leave tribulation is going to be rained down on everybody right right whoever's left they're gonna get it you agree a lot of dangerous people see not the Gentiles to Daniel's people and Daniel was a Jew next quote exactly or here we go now remember the first four so what we always do and even the scripture says it but you understand what it's saying we got four trumpets got fifth trumpet six trumpets I even read the fifth and sixth grade I'm going to so we you know to get to the fifth and sixth you got to get the four do you agree right right you agree right okay am I okay are your mathematics right but there's something comes up with those four that they get stopped let's read it right here so it's scripture you got to put it together and brothers said there's an interval and the intervals chapter seven is that what he said exactly look we'll get there in a minute and after these things I saw four Angels standing on four corners are holding the four waves the Earth and that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the seat or on the tree when I read the first four trumpets wasn't that plagues on the Earth interruption in nature this is what it's referenced back to okay and I saw another Angel sinning from the East right having the Seal of God does it sound like the e-course Rider remember the acorn right where he marked them is that what he did in the Old Testament right he said Mark them and don't hurt them because they'll Escape out of the city is that what it was there in Titus brother Ben brought it who is this it's the acorn writer right right it's the Holy Ghost exactly they're going to receive a holy ghost seals 144 thousand I can prove it right here right they're going to get an acorn Rider going to come through and mark them right with the Seal of God is that what Dean corn Rider does read it look voice to the Four Angels two is given to hurt the earth and the sea those angels that were overlooked could hurt the earth and the sea but there's some made them stop listen to what it was saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till right we have sealed the Servants of our God in their forehead it's an interval do you agree it's rather it says interval between the sixth and seventh seal there's an interval between the sixth and seventh trumpet this is the interval he's talking about scriptural and he says it he says Revelation chapter seven he points this right back here I know it's kind of it'll come together I promise you it will when you see my timeline you'll see it even everybody understand that right I'm gonna go here I heard the number of them which were sealed sealed so it means they got the Holy Ghost 144 of that is going to say the same Holy Ghost you got it's going to be under the son of man Ministry brother babe said proving his word it's all gathered up under the son of man everybody agree with that that Messiah week is the son of man Ministry the seven Church ages get that we on the other side of the age it receives the the Mysteries the Revelation we've come on we got to revelation we've received the the revealed word who's your maintenance I heard it brother for him say the revealed word why did he say it That Way Baptist says they believe the Bible there's one Church saying we only we just we stay with the Bible only you liar I heard another sealed never sealed 144 000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel go up to where it says Levi I think I got it underlined Maybe does everybody understand Levi wasn't in the 12 tribes they were taken out yeah these 144 000 Levi's put back in you know why this is not going to be a levitical priesthood forum that's why God ain't gonna let him build that that what they want to build to sacrifice Idols they don't need a levitical priesthood he died once for all right got it look God's taking the Levi's out of being over him and being priest he's putting them back in with the brethren so the Levi ain't nothing but like one of the other 11 tribes they're not a separated group they're going to have to seem the same message the other 11 tribes do amen and see people in the message are working I know you said it I'm not talking about you they're talking about these Levi Richmond and all these guys that's the levitical priesthood yeah they I'm going to be honest with you guys I don't believe they're going to bring the son of man Ministry it's going to be Elijah and Moses Elijah and Moses is the israelic priesthood it's showing you that the levitical priesthood's over when God goes those 144 000 he's going to be dealing with a levitical priesthood he's going to be dealing with a Melchizedek priesthood exactly that's what that's telling you there and we're monkeying around with a bunch of Levites over there thinking that now they may be a part of the 144 000 fine but God ain't going to use that levitical priesthood anymore you understand it's the truth it's gonna be 144 000 right okay go on let's go up going up okay there's another entity here uh where was it at brother anyway we understand the Jews where did the Gentiles start coming in brother where where back it up I think he's right there in it whoa whoa okay after there's three entities that's expressed in Revelation chapter 7. everybody understand what I'm saying between at six and seventh trumpet the sixth and seventh seal there's three entities that God deals with in Redemption I won't say three and let's go I know it kind of might blow your mind a little bit I'm gonna show you if I can by the quote okay listen to what says and this I'd be held a lower great multitude no man could number of all Nations kindreds and people in tongues it sounds like Gentiles don't it stood Before the Throne before the lamb clothed with white robes and Palms in her hand cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which set us upon the throne upon the lamb and all the Angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts that fell Before the Throne of their faces and worshiped God saying amen blessing and the glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving honor and power and might be under our God forever and ever amen and one of the elders answers say to him what are these which are red and white robes and with skin that he didn't recognize the Gentiles right the elders only recognized the Jews they were Jews right we didn't have any of their tribal Garb on wait oh and I said unto him sir thou knowest he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation now I'm gonna brother Bradham uses this scripture two ways and I know why he did it does the Bride come out of tribulation no the prince said we don't go in the tree did he say that we don't come out of Great Tribulation people no we don't go into tribulation exactly everybody totally agree with what I'm saying now before that it said it'll be gathering around her throne that is the bride it says Great Tribulation and brother and we use that two ways and I'm going to explain why and this scripture is a character of the church and the bride and it's mixed together if you don't know how if you don't have a revelation you'll never figure that out and brother Brandon did it for us I mean brother Wade we're sitting here today I said brother Wade who do you think this is in seven he said it's the bride brother bran said it was a church but he also said in the bride in the church age seven seal he said it was the church or the church right and in the end of the church age he said it's a bride but the characteristic the bride don't go through tribulation right right there's where you got to stop this you understand is she around the throne day and night serving him that's the characteristic of Bride so look between the six and seven see there's there's two entities that are going to come out there redeemed the the good version the wise virgin and the foolish virgin and 144 000. so brother Raymond that one passage of scripture so is the church and the bride and I have no problem with that right if you use it either way as long as you explain it if you say I go through Great Tribulation I can show you quote after quote where I don't right where if I'm gathered around the throat servant he might show you quote after quote where I am there does everybody got what I'm saying it might be different once you heard it I'm gonna read the two quotes and you'll see what I'm saying therefore they are Before the Throne of God serving day and night in this Temple they shall hunger no more never thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them shall lead them into ever to let unto living Fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all the tears from your eyes look here we go okay I'll start down here I gotta I gotta get where I'm getting going here are these why which are red and white robes and when it's coming south they this is under the seven seal by the way okay who are these which are red and white robes and which cometh they John answering now and I said it to him sir I know it's John didn't know them see all kindreds tongues and Nations and he said unto me these are he said unto me uh these are they which came out a Great Tribulation see where he puts it Great Tribulation right in other words Great Tribulation and have washed their robes made them white in the blood of the Lamb therefore they are Before the Throne of God set him day and night brother Abel is on but we know that you know by and they had set up on the throat shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither shall they thirst anymore uh let me go to that for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them shall lead them going down I'm just reading scripture now okay let's go to the next quote let's see yeah now we open to get to the seal and did you notice there first start Israel and we see the purge church not the bride right is that what he said I didn't say it he said it he says that's the church did I just read it yeah okay come over here great number of real sincere hearts that came up out of the Great Tribulation not the church it's gone on the bride there's the church he says the bride don't go through tribulation that's what he said over and over okay right you agree with what I'm saying now let's read what it says in the church age book he says God talking about the bride here do you want to see another picture of her is over in Revelation 7 4 17. right so he calls it the church up here right he's told it's a bride here there's characteristics of both of them in there that's why you you got to take the characters of the Bride out of there she's around his throne day and night those that come up under tribulation are going to be outside of the city the only ones that's going to be in that pyramid City the ones that got the Holy Ghost right they ain't going to stand before him day and night are they exactly those tribulations say he's going to stand before God day and night it's only the bride but we don't go through Great Tribulation so you got to look at this scripture and you can have a revelation what he's talking about right and he uses it both ways because it if you want to talk about the church I can use that to a portion if I'm talking about the bride I can use that to a portion right and brother Branham does that does everybody agree with me because if I would have called her the one which I want to type it with what I'm doing as The Purge Saints it goes through tribulation okay but you can use it either way I know it's been a lot of time on that but it'll confuse you if I don't explain it I don't leave him with a bunch of questions let's go let's go okay go up go up okay that's okay but it says you see the 12 tribes it mentions that you're reading down going up where it's highlighted no down down I'm sorry I'm going the wrong way down down there we go who are they these are the bride right one place he says it's the church another seven seal of the church agency says it's the bride right so you gotta say am I going to argue a quote with a quote do I look stupid don't answer that I really get disgusted with ministers that argue a quote with a globe the reason you're arguing it you don't you don't have a revelation what he said everybody got what I'm saying that's the problem we have around they don't really understand they say well he changed his mind on Daniel Saturday no he didn't he said three and a half years he's talking in the seals of the seven of the of the Messiah week if I say it a different way the son of man Ministry the Messiah week is the son of man Ministry it's a seven year Ministry it's God complete in three and a half answer me he's perfect in three he's completing seven right you three and a half is not on either of them folks so you got you got to get your types right brother I said whatever you do get your threes and sevens right right okay so they serve me to Temple they are the special care Lord they are his bride blows your weight on it go up next quote the bride goes wherever the bridegroom is she will never she will never be left by well he'll left by him she will learn never leave aside see in the portion he's taken with him he's not staying we're going through Great Tribulation he reads the scripture but he doesn't say we're going through great we're not right come on people she will never be left by him she will never leave aside she will share the throne with him she will be crowned with his glory and honor brother Ram typed it both ways how many knows he taught Noah as the people that went over tribulation and as the raptured Saints you know what brother Graham did here did he do what Noah did it's no different check it out see what he's saying okay let's go now one thing I'm gonna I'm gonna interject here remember he said under Daniel if you don't understand it you don't get three woes do you say it right you're gonna be at the seven vials you're not going to get seven trumpets did he say it I read it to you all you're not going to get them you'll never get them three woes Revelation 8 13. now I've been held and heard an Angel flying through the midst of Heaven saying with loud voice whoa whoa whoa to the inhabit reserved by reason of the other voices of The Trumpet of the Three Angels which are yet to sound right right now this is the third Angel's message to the world and you know what the third Angel's message is going forth now in this day what he said this is the flying of the third Angel message if you're a Bible read there was three woes followed it the first one happened in World War One okay second one happened in World War II right right see what we're going in now all right we're at the end of the row which is the last World War Armageddon right right we have never had a World War since World War II the battle of Armageddon is going to take the world to the Gates of Jerusalem that's going to be your third woe in your third world war does everybody understand that he said it I didn't know okay it's important you understand the woes because if you don't place them right you won't see where the trumpets are right everybody got what I'm saying okay let's go fifth angel fifth trumpet and the fifth angel sounded and I saw where am I at how long I got how long I got it's fourth or 3 30. okay the fifth angel sounding I saw a story from Heaven into the Earth and him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottom of his Pit and the rose the smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace to the sun in the air we're darkened by reason the smoke of the pit remember Brethren preach it's a dreary day it's not light or dark that's this day I want to tell you that fifth trumpet's already been opened and I'm going to prove it by the message the fifth trumpet's already sounded but the first four were stopped white there's an interval I'm not going to let you go with them four and tell my servants are sealed does everybody understand that I'm not going to let them go until you seal them boys so stop those he didn't stop the fifth sixth you understand the seventh's the end of all things just what the seven seal is right right he said the seven seal the seven Trumpets the same you agree right I see a lot of you're gonna have to explain this one I'm going quick you will he knows it already anyway listen to it listen to it and then and work with him he'll get you there I'm gonna go be here okay coming today which shall not be light or dark during this isn't that what it is when whoever this guy is that comes out of the bottomless pit it's going to be a dreary day we're going to explain who he is here in a minute what scripture does you agree there shall come out of smoke locusts upon the Earth great and to them was given power as a scorpions Earth have power remember he said he'd restore the years the the eating strip the nations of their Fellowship their leaves this is my comments when I put it in parenth is what I'm saying these locusts try to do one thing torment people on the Earth right yeah and he'll even say it he'll say it here in a minute and I'll point it out they're tormentors them locusts that are on the earth now they're here now yes that may blow your mind away they're here now right right fifth trumpet has already sounded it's been opened the first four were held but the fifth and sixth were not held right it's not the end of all things we know the seventh hadn't opened up I can place them by the two prophets they're gonna they're gonna be the seventh trumpet you realize brother I'm gonna say this seventh year seven seal was the coming Lord Revelation 10 7. what does it say today's the voice of the seventh angel right he's brother Brown is associated with the seventh seal oh yeah sure who's this message Christ is this message a mighty Angel to come down the rest of it ain't my message ain't my thinking right brother Ram's a part of the seventh seals so are you sure see it's like he said yesterday if you don't take this and make it personal to you right if every scripture in there don't talk to your heart if you don't you don't see yourself in a word like Jesus saw himself in the word he said destroy the temple I'll raise it up in three days exactly sure because he's seen songs where it said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption in three days your body starts corrupting he never seen corruption you know why he didn't see corruption because there was no sin in him God had to bring him out before he started decaying right or it would have been a leavening effect on that body just gonna be honest with you guys that's why I preached 11. okay so these scorpions come out are locust on the earth unto them was power given as the Scorpions of the Earth have power what does Scorpions on the earth do they sting you they torment you man they'll hurt you some of them will kill you come on 9-4 and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass or of the earth look the first four couldn't hurt interrupt nature could it no it it told him don't you do that right so this boy said I'm Gonna Let You Out Mr Locust but you don't hurt the grass last time I checked if it was a locust like a little fly it eats everybody seen a locust plague well you won't have grass left on the ground when they come through will you anybody ever seen them before there was one in Nebraska in the early 1900s I'd seen a picture of it man they wiped every there wasn't a green thing left on a tree there wasn't a green thing left nowhere you know what brother Brown said the leaves are that the Locust leaves off the tree do you know what he said that was these locusts that come out are eating a fellowship off the Nations there ain't no Nation can agree now we spy on it Britain they spy on us and they're our friends you don't have any Fellowship among the Nations come on who are you kidding great business Great Rentals sell you out tomorrow if it did them good since these locusts have let out they tried to form a United Nations in the early 1900s and couldn't do it and they got that stupid one set up in New York that we pay for they don't even agree then two of them can agree on anything yeah that's a jazz a facade that's a joke but what is it these locusts are coming out they've ate the fellowship you can't have Fellowship anywhere we can't Fellowship other message churches don't tell me these locals saying here eating the greens off the tree you tell them what you believe that when he fellowshift you don't like Christ they'll chew the they'll chew the leaves right off your tree waltay you know you've had I've had mine ate more than once oh yeah a committee that should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree I said read Revelation 7 1-3 what it says stop don't you interrupt nature yet right right it's going to come but I'm going to stop you first four because I got 144 000 to seal I got a purge see what I'm saying it's afterwards you know I gotta Purge the rest everybody understand okay here we go but those but only those men which have not the Seal of God in their foreheads right okay and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented they're tormentors they're tormentors that's been led up out of the bottomless pit just to be honest with you okay and to them is get tormented five months and their torment was as a torment of a scorpion right remember brother man said it'd be locusts it looked like Locust they have a stinger like a scorpion remember he said that this is where he's getting it when he strikes a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and Death Shall Not shall flee from them right the shape of the locusts were likened to horses prepared unto battle isn't that something and on their heads whereas were crowns like golden their faces where the faces of men they had hair as the hair of women and her teeth wears the teeth of lions and they had breastplates that were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of Chariots and many horses running to battle I'm going to tell you something if you ever I don't know how your church is you ever see one family or one person at church every time there's a battle they run to it they got to get involved in it there's something wrong with your spirit when you do that brother Adam said if something comes into the church you stay neutral on it right do you know brother Ram said that guys is that what he said somebody comes in here starts bad-mouthing him you're supposed to keep your mouth shut right they say you say that's what you think it ain't what I think right you're supposed to not go but if you run to that battle right then you become a part of the battle you're a part of the mass then right if you know a pastor's supposed to get between the two parties and bring them to a resolution but what people want to do in the church well I don't think brother Samuel's doing it right right they didn't put you in God did right if God don't want you he'll take you out if there's seed here and he's going to injure it God will take him out right sure God will take him home early you believe that right amen all right you go here you don't like the way you run it I don't like who he preaches I don't like the way shut up right every time something comes up at the church you're ready to take sides with it quit running the battle they had tails like little scorpions they were stings in their tails and her power was to hurt me in five months I said it's a season of Torment listen to this fella they had a key over there which is the Angel of the bottom spit who's naming the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon but in a Greek tank his name is apollyon do you know what it means Destroyer you know who was laying out of the bottle was fit under the fifth trumpet the Destroyer under the fifth throne but somebody come was released out of the bottomless pit and he was over those locusts you know what his job is to cause Discord among the brothers let's read the quotes right Revelation 9 1 or the fifth drop of 13. notice Revelation uh moved down it's often what you think now the king of this great group of two hundred thousand and now brother Branham introduces in the sixth trumpet but he's talking about the fifth trumpet okay so under the fifth trumpet this bad guy the Destroyer comes out of the bottomless pit and with him he's got locusts that are going to torment to women now brother Brad is going to Brother Brad was going to interpret this he's a Divine interpreter when I start interpreting you'll know exactly you've heard the quotes I want to tie it up for you okay okay they had a king over them and if we noticed it was a fallen story why out there falling manual Lucifer oh how Dr Smith got that so scruple up there but it's all right see was it for his hour all right was the bottomless pit their King was the king of the bottomless pit he come out I'm going to show you I can almost place the timing come out well I'm gonna show you it'll measure when you read it when you see it Revelation say 10 I wrote something down here I'm just going to read it you see here Revelation 17 8 I want to read what it says there because I don't know just how I hit how to hit the next 17A and the Beast without sauce was is not and shall Ascend on the bottom of his pit and shall go into Perdition right he's out of the bottom of this pit and he's going to go all the way to the end now the fifth trumpet was opened up in the early 1900s I'm going to prove it in a minute I can prove what I'm saying and it's not going to stop until he goes into perdition the first four trumpets have it sounded because that angel said don't do it until I seal them the acorn Rider stopped him from destroying Jerusalem until they could steal those Jews until they escaped am I telling you the truth or am I am the same thing's Happening Here God's not going to let him destroy that until it was 144 000 get sealed right if he'd let them first four trumpets go they destroyed just about everything does everybody understand what I'm saying so he's not going to let that happen until those 144 000 get sealed right everybody okay is what I'm talking about dwell upon the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life for the life from the foundation of the world whether they beheld the Beast which was which is not and which yet is right next quote and they made their first organization huh and that was the Catholic Church God's Church never was organized until Catholicism and then it was a forcing that you had to do it or they pulled them apart with ox they burned them they fed them lines they've done everything and they forced in a false Unity the locusts began to sting brother Branham is interpreting what those locusts are for us a false Unity is the sting of those locusts God help me I know people are going to see this and I'm not critical does everybody understand what I'm saying right what happened when this come in the first time can I say that under Constantine he called them all together all the ministers to come together we're going to come under the unity of the faith and it looks like a beautiful it sounds good don't it that does it sound pretty they were out there first some of them were killing each other Kirsten were killing Christians over Doctrine well that sounds familiar yeah said if you kill a man's influence killed a man exactly that happens around the message Daniel 30 weeks you're wrong bam don't listen to brother Claude shoot you in the back yeah yeah they do it yeah but they do it under the pretense it's the unity of the faith brother man said they won't prophets they should have never went there did he say it they should have never went there exactly because it was a false Unity they were going to get stung right everybody understand that some of them actually went into that and they didn't want to go into it because they went to it a lot of these preachers made it you know the number one thing they preach you need the faith do I believe in unity the faith yeah if it's with the word if it ain't with the word I'm not going to get hide under that remember unleavened bread God ain't gonna put his name on something it's got levny in it right you mean I got to have Unity of the faith the word yes that's where God's going to meet you he's not going to meet you under a false pretense or a false Unity what's going on around the message there's a false Unity going on right that thing started in the early 1900s and I'm going to prove it by history here in a minute it's too bad after the caliper got into the Pentecostal church and broke up the Brotherhood see what they do you know there's certain churches where a daughter goes over this church her days of Pastor he's a deacon over here you can't go visit her because they don't believe like I do I mean a monkey treats his babies better than that obviously I I thought we were human I thought we were the highest form a monkey won't desert their baby if you had a daughter that was over in a church at Peach two Lords would you still fell a shipper Brother Ray would you well you ought to you if you're not you're no better than a monkey I won't be I know that sounds funny but it's a monkey will leave his own they'll take care and they'll feed him bananas but we oh you don't believe it just like I do you're out I don't know it all but I will say what I know is thus saith the Lord and you're not right I'll tell you you're not right but I'm not going to draw you out you know what they tell us well I'm gonna draw you back in because I don't agree with them they get up and slam you for what you just preached they're not drawing you in they're drawing you out knucklehead let's read it Council of churches in the more modern times John Ardmore organized in 1910 does that sound familiar the fifth trumpet was open I'm going to tell you when it was over I can place it by the whoa he said if you don't get Daniel 70 weeks right you won't get the woes you won't get the plagues which are the Feast of the trumpets you won't get the vials you won't get the woes is that what he said there's a reason he said and it's part of the 70th week he didn't say the three and a half years he said the 70th week what is wrong with us organized the 19th International missionary Conference held in Edinboro well attended well attended you get it this conference fostered other movements out of its spring International missionary Council of 1921 Bishop Charles Brandon the United States returned member fired up to create the World Conference of faith it started the World Council of churches they didn't become founded until 1948 but the spirit of that Destroyer came out the fifth trumpet is beyond a doubt open oh yeah and I'm going to give you in the mouth of two or three Witnesses it'll be a stab this is one I can prove it what did Brother man say their stinger was false Unity what are they starting to bring in the early 1900s false Unity exactly how can two walk together unless they be agreed now brother we want to have Unity under the faith we can't even agree on Daniel's 70 weeks we're going to have Unity the faith and you believe it one way and I believe it or not but we're going to have Unity the faith am I stupid I feel like Tom do I have stupid road on my forehead let's wake up ministers if it's Union it's one Lord One Faith one baptism right right so you know here's the spirit launched out in 1910 everybody agree thank you 1927 I got a date there 1925 1937 19th to go up I'm not gonna read all the notes are on the internet would you guys go read them not until this day August 27th was the plan fulfilled then the World Council of churches was born in Amsterdam every one of those organizations joined into that right you go out the internet look at the World Council churches show you every church that's in it now it's a false Unity they've been stung by that Locus is that what brother man said in a quote I'm not interpreting I'm telling you what it said what he said The Sting of that Locus is a false Unity that's what one of them is okay he said there will be hideous sights upon the Earth locusts with hair like women long hair and I want thin women that cut their hair yeah they're tormentors right sister you cut your hair God will haunt you you'll follow you'll get haunted did you know that right these sisters out here that cut their hair wear makeup Flappers are haunted of God gotta let them that fifth trumpet fall on them some of them you know what what it's supposed to do drive you up oh yeah get you in the message really all right if the if the trumps are dry visual back to the Homeland right Brother Brad said those those two hundred thousand thousand under the Sixth trumpet he said there's not that many natural there's 200 million 200 000 000. 200 comma oh oh you had a thousand do it two hundred thousand Horsemen 200 million he said we ain't got that in the world he said those weren't natural horses those were spiritual horses spiritual Chargers is that what he said brother right right haunt the women teeth like lions Stingers in their tails like storms they would turn more torment men months he's telling them it not only does it torment you under false Unity you agree but also torment you if you cut your hair let me show you a time you know uh Samson had Seven Locks as long as he kept those Seven Locks didn't trim none of them off he had his power we got seven Church age Messengers you cut any one of them off you lose your power and you'll be tormented right brother man said not one messenger tolerated a woman cutting her hair did you know he said that if you cut one little lock off your head if you trim it up you're going to be tormented sister I'm warning you it's time to grow up it's time to come under your messenger get serious about this just wait till we get an opening of them plagues and seals and then seven Thunders watch what takes place oh brother you'll better get to Goshen well there's time to get to Goshen don't pay any attention to this outside does everybody understand that three of the plagues in Israel fell when the children were still in Egypt did you know that you agree the fourth one fella got them in the Goshen but he let some of them fall when they were here everybody got what I'm saying yeah next quote I'm gonna uh I'm gonna just read the highlights okay gotta hurry it'd be tormenting women be locusts come upon the Earth with long hair to torment women who cut theirs off hair like women hanging down in long teeth like a lion Stingers in their tail like a scorpion and so forth to torment men upon the Earth but within it'll be too late to do anything about it you'll get right now tormenting right go up this I looked up on the Internet okay look it said it talks about how the Bob come out how the women started bobbing their hair everybody understand that remember said a woman Bob her hair there let's read it it all started in 1915. yeah 1910 you had to start of the unity false Unity you agree that bad boy come out that false Unity started coming out that Destroyer and then the locus fold right behind him everybody agree was he over the Locust it says in the scripture was that Destroyer over the locus he's over the 200 million horses that guy is over it he hasn't gone anywhere he's here right okay it all started 950 with a debut of the castle Bob that's where they got Bob dare named after the celebrated Ballroom dancer Irene Castle while cutting your hair for convenience little would she know that she would forever be associated with triggering a revolution in 20th century hair fashion Castle Bob would be the first to enter indication of things to come three-quarter The Rage of short hair what did they start doing cutting her hair off what was those locusts supposed to do staying if there's false Unity he gets stung if you Bob your hair you get stung if you cut off any messenger you'll get stung right brother babe said I said what Paul said brother M didn't cut him off right right or he had a right for torment if you cut off any of those seven Church age Messengers message you're going to get stung you're cutting your hair because your hair is recovering is that right brother okay go up I got it highlighted ones I want or Go Down Nutrition right this was and then more warrant started does everybody understand that so the bobbing of hair the false Unity started before World War One what did Brotherhood say the first war was World War one was what the first woe did he say it remember I read the quote now the first world war one started the first woe listen the attrition rate nutrients has left you with hope that they would survive long enough to return home they found themselves inflicted with it eat drink and die and be merry for tomorrow we die there was no hope for them men in trenches one day the British ran 50 000 men into machine guns and mowed them down fifty thousand remember it said the men would have no hope yeah that's what it's talking about under that fifth trumpet they had no hope they mowed them down they would take in World War One there was nothing one the other one thing they'd get up say charge remember uh uh 50 000 and one day they'd mow down they said in one day there was like a hundred thousand artillery rounds fired where you couldn't put your hand down and hit they said they don't know how anybody survived it they would charge and they'd just mow them down so those men that were in those Treasures had no hope whatsoever they could care live or die you know I don't care anymore have anybody ever seen pictures of they say the war without hope well that's what it's taught under the go read the fifth trumpet again I know I read it fast but it says they'd have no hope right I mean you know falling them out and said I don't care I just kick me I let him shoot me I don't care I'm tired of this I've spent four years in this stupid hole hardly got enough food to eat they'll one day you charge you take that trench they'll charge and take it back World War one we didn't win one piece of real estate other than one and I preached that here the only thing they got in World War one was Jerusalem Jerusalem came out the British defeated the Ottoman Empire and pushed them out of Jerusalem the whole purpose of World War One is now we got Jerusalem in World War One into Christian hands and the British would eventually give it back to the Jews the only thing accomplished in World War one was the retaking of Israel right go see it right right go up to the next highlight and underline go here you go however they're going to get mad at me back there they've done a good job however nearly a whole generation of young men had died in the war remember the scripture says that seven women take a whole one man there's a lot of things come out of War there's there's out of that fifth trumpet there's that Destroyer that come out and people's lives are starting to change drastically after that okay however nearly a whole generation young men had died in the war leaving nearly a whole generation of young women without possible suitors sounds like a message believer most of these women in a message Church they think first guy that comes along boy if this guy don't take me out another one won't come along and want me what is wrong with you girls so the prettiest guy girls I've seen in a message Church ain't all made up they get what they're looking at they like you go out there and she's all painted up dude up and well you don't know what you're getting why is that in the world we used to joke we said you know what we call it coyote you know what a coyote he does if he gets his leg in a trap he'll chew his arm off to get away from it we call her Miss coyote sometimes you wake up beside a woman chew your arm off to get away from her what she takes all of her makeup off it's oh my Lord it ain't what I thought it was we used we used to sell you so miss coyote you're laughing but it's the truth you married a woman called got all painted up you don't know what you're getting right you know that I'm gonna tell a joke to lighten it up a little remember they lost that uh who was it the the oh the guy the mobster Jimmy Hoffa yeah they say they finally found Jimmy Hoffa underneath Tammy Faye's makeup it's about the truth isn't it you don't know what you're getting that's the point right I'm gonna read some quotes here in a minute you think this ain't funny this is a spirit that struck the land right and you'll fall into that if you're not careful sisters right the flapper let's go go up to where my highlights are go up go up here we go here we go in America flapper has always been a giddy attractive and slightly unconventional Young Thing who an H.L mention's words was a somewhat foolish girl full of wild surmisis and inclined to revolt against the precepts and admonitions of her Elders does that sound familiar people some of you don't have kids here yeah Flappers had both an image and an attitude brother hemp say if your mother's a flapper you'll be a flapper daughter will be a flapper you know he said that okay the flappers image consistently drastic to some shocking changes women's clothing and hair nearly every article of clothing was trimmed down enlightened in order to make movement easier not only did she cut her hair she started trimming her dress off yeah her sleeves off I've seen some sisters and met you raise your arms up I can see all the way through your blouse something wrong brother man said you're not supposed to be able to see your underneath clothes did you know he said that she's supposed to be modestly apparel if you don't bleach your clothesline you're not preaching the message you know we would we want to get all this Revelation when we do the little things come on people let's go go down okay Flappers always started wearing makeup oh something that had previously been only worn by loose women Rouge powder eyeliner lipstick become extremely popular quote I said how can I teach him algebra when they won't learn their ABCs you know what algebra is it's putting the algebra's uh Arabic word that means putting the pieces together how are you going to put all these Revelations together when you can't even do that you can't even dress right you can't even talk right you can't even walk right you think God's going to give you these greater Revelations you you might have it in between your ears but if it ain't made flesh it ain't become a revelation yeah I'm gonna be honest I feel that way if you don't live it you don't believe it if honestly like my past years if you've got a revelation smoking's wrong how could you ever smoke another cigarette right if you had a revelation that's wrong you'd lay them down right right wouldn't you even if it killed you you say I'm quitting this it ain't right all right okay so you see certainly how can you do it such a conglomeration to see it the mark of it shows anyone knows that pain is a heathen Drake whoops I'm a missionary heathens paint the Indians painted their faces here in Arizona before they knowed God they ever know God you don't have to tell them no more about it they'll take it off right we got people sending the message still wearing makeup I hear people that say well they make up its base it's before you put on makeup still not the real you you know right come on just like I was here one time before people say why wear clear nail polish brother Ram didn't say a color he just said polish he didn't say red he said well I don't wear red that's self-interpretation that's adultery on Christ he told you not to wear that I'd go in my own church and somebody hand me a dish and her fingernails be painted I almost hated to take the plate out of their hands you think I'm being dog Maddie no I preach a message and they're still doing that stuff brother said I go to California I preach it gets worse and worse it'll do that right here by the preaching of the word you're either getting better or worse every service you come in is that what he said some of you are getting worse and some of you will get better when you leave this you're not going to stay the same as what he said shows are at war with God if you wear a paint you're at War right Indians wore paint when they went to war if you wear a paint your own war with God I didn't say it he did when they take it off shows they're at peace with God flapper attitude let's go down there flapper attitude was characterized by Stark truthless fast living and sexual behavior that's what it everything started zero in on sex does everybody know this Obamacare the major reason it was done it's sex they want to pay for abortions they want to pay for birth control and when you buy Obamacare you're helping pay for it that's right does everybody understand that come on it's ridiculous Flappers seem to cling to youth as they were to leave them at any moment they took risks and were Reckless up down down it's opposite of what you're looking at you can read this right here I want to say this this I really like this okay listen and this is just a guy out in the world who wrote this off the internet I think it's wonderful listen when she cuts her hair look out when your wife who has had long hair since you've known her suddenly decides one day that nice shoulder length bob would flatter her more or worse comes home out of the blue one day with all of her hair hacked off and look out this is probably around the time she'll stop having sex with you I'm just reading what he's saying I'm gonna be playing to the pure all things are pure by the way you know what sometimes I wonder when I'm PR we preach serpent seed and they look around we got all these little kids it's like you know I mean it's got to be a paradox but anyway uh where are we at where are we at where do I go oh this probably around the time she stopped having sex you probably around the time she'll start mentioning breaking up a divorce at the very least you should understand that she is going through something very emotional very unpleasant and more than likely something very much related to you when a woman cuts her hair off it's not about wanting a cute new look no matter what anyone says it's about sheer emotional turmoil yeah if you don't believe it just look at what's been happening in Hollywood Nicole Kidman cut all her hair off spontaneously and then a month later divorce was announced Jennifer Aniston hacked off all over here that she was famous for immediately after waiting to Brett Pitt and later told Vanity Fair about the tremendous stress she was under during and after the wedding and how the first year of the marriage has been the hardest of her life you looked into the lives of every if you look the lives of every celebrity who had long hair for a time and then slipped it off like Kim Basinger beg Ryan among others you would find all that luxurious hair grown back as soon as the lady was fun was found as soon as the lady has found happiness with a new love the only mystery here is why more people haven't caught on to the shuttle but deadly warning sign you know what when you let your hair grow out women it shows you're in love with Jesus Christ you found a new love let's just be honest if you love Jesus sister you ain't gonna cut your hair right because you just when you do that you dishonor your husband and you dishonor Christ is that what the scripture says where did I get to right away um where where did I get to oh okay but why should this be why should a woman's hair have anything to do with their emotions cause hair for almost everyone represents femininity Beauty and sometimes therefore what she thinks of herself when you deal with these aspects of the woman emotions naturally Run High I see the documentary on the Jews the women they asked the women they had lived through the the uh the uh Holocaust they said what's the worst thing they've done to you when they cut my hair off first thing they did was shave them ball and send them right they asked him what was the worst thing that they did to you this is when they shaved my hair off it knew you had no rights at that point that you weren't your own that they had control of you yeah cut your hair it just means the devil's got control of you yeah whole house to say it that's right it's no accident the stress where unpleasant days have been due Bad Hair Days since emotions a woman feels when things aren't going well or almost as unpleasant as what she feels but you just can't get her hair to look nice or life ladder conform to the Styles she wants I've seen my wife in the mirror go nuts you know my wife's got real long hair she don't get it just right and make does you do that it's got to be just so so something about your hair it's it's IT projects something about your emotions a woman ain't emotionally right she won't get out of bed she won't comb her hair I mean if you go to the home that night brother your wife's stealing or not you know got her hair all messed up something wrong she ain't happy I'll tell you that I guarantee you won't go to Walmart that way but you're sure look at your husband that way who you trying to impress the guys at Walmart or your husband well it may sound it sounds funny but it's not funny it's serious this stuff started happening under that fifth trumpet I'm telling you hey I want to go down here in conversely you'll see confidence sexual I am bullet self-esteem more inactive seedless played than a woman who has Gorgeous Hair and knows it one of those emotions are more closely linked to her hair than any other part of her isn't that something as any woman who seeks out a wig after chemotherapy will tell you Samson the biblical figure who lost his power when does cut off his hair should have been written as a woman so what I told you the Seven Locks types of seven Church eight when he trimmed his ear off he lost his strength right right everybody understand that okay up let's go to six so everybody understand that Stinger stings women who cut their hair there's there that spirit that Destroyer brought some Spirits with him out of the regions yeah yeah everybody understand that and women started cutting her hair women started loose living right I showed you the characteristics okay now look here let's let's say one what was passed one what was passing behold there come two woes more thereafter the first one ended at the end of world war one right that's when that fifth trumpet come out right before World War One right that's what your Prophet said I'm not making this up is that you're saying amen so you agree with what I'm saying six Angels six trumpet six Angels sound I Heard a Voice from four horns at all golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth Angel which had to trumpet loose the Four Angels which are bound to greater fear of phrase and the Four Angels now these are different Angels when you read Revelation you better understand what Angel is brother Adam said Angel could be a messenger Angel could be an Angelic being now brother Branham and I'll read the quotes in a minute I'm going to say it now those four Angels let out of the river Euphrates were Eichmann Hitler Mussolini and Stalin I'm going to tell you ahead of time but I you know I can prove that by Pro by quote any of you that's read the message at all some of you are shaking your head loose the Four Angels was bound to the great river Euphrates and the Four Angels were loosed which were repaired prepared for an hour a day a month and a year for a certain amount of time these angels are going to strike the Earth everybody agree with that for to slay the third part of men does everybody understand six million Jews were killed during World War II there's only 18 million on the earth a third part of the Jews were killed off the Earth the trumpets are the Jews right yeah yeah but God's also going to use plagues to get you moving too that's what he's doing when you come to this message after that is everything just a flowery bed of ease you come home and there's roses in your bed on your pillow and everything's just really good I don't know about you some of the worst days I've ever had in this life is when I've been under in this message because president said those 200 000 are all aimed at the bride remember they're spiritual Chargers Supernatural devils now look Spirits get off on men everybody understand that you take and I did it I took the population of Russia Germany and Italy it's about 300 million do you know people had the spirit so bad some of the neighbors of those Jews had turned them in there were Spirits loud on the people and they started persecuting it might have been your next door neighbor it didn't have to have a Nazi uniform on there's many Germans that sold those Jews out they had a spirit on them do you understand that they persecuted them they did in Italy Stalin killed a bunch of Jews too folks you better go look at your history okay right you agree how many dollars for 200 000 000 and I heard the number of them that's 200 million and thus I saw the horses in division and them and sat on them having breastplates of Fire now John didn't see all these modern things we got so he described it as the best way he could in his hour okay my brother Brandon's going to interpret it I ain't Brimstone the head of the horses whereas the heads of lions out of the mouth issued fire smoke and brimstone by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouth right for their powers in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like in the serpents and had heads with them they did hurt okay well it's 9 20 the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not right the Jew the eight the other 12 million Jews that were there they haven't still haven't repented is that true they still haven't repented they're not going to be able to until they get them two witnesses right let's listen to what they did yeah not repent of the works of the hands that they should not worship devils and Idols of gold what did them Jews at the bottom of that mountain dance around a calf of gold what you know what a Jew holds on to gold silver stock money right now the scripture says all Jews are not Jews just like all message Believers ain't message believers shock huh shouldn't be right right you know that you guys been around some of you been some of you've been thrown out of churches some of you been robbed before you got thrown out you were under a black horse preacher amen now I'm just being honest it's the truth yeah a preacher all the time pulling for money he's a black horse rider brother for him said you get on T you watch this TV preacher always pulling for money that's black horse this guy gets something to pull Pullman begging for money all the time you better run for your life right the money yeah repenting all the worst of the hands they should not worship they worship them both and Idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which they never all them Jews they still didn't repent now look at this one neither repented they have their murders so those Nazis have you ever seen on film go to YouTube I challenge her anywhere where a Nazi will say yep I killed them they'll say no I was ordered two they have never repented of what they did I have yet to see one Nazi that repented a killing a Jew right has anybody here seen one I'm asking you you won't it says neither neither they repent of their sins either repented there their murders nor their sorceries or their fornication nor their thefts they looted Europe right Jews are still trying to get some of their art collections they're in New York in the New York Museum's got several million dollars worth of Jewish arts and they won't give them back to him sorry are you kidding me Feast of trumpets note in Revelation 9 Chapter 13 Verse now real close under the Sixth trumpet Revelation 9 through under the Sixth Trump I know there were two a thousand Horsemen that have been bound to river Euphrates was turned loose under the Sixth trumpet now there was not 200 000 Horsemen in the world but there was two hundred thousand Horsemen notice that I want you to jot it down so you can read it they wasn't natural horses they breathed fire and they had breastplates of Jasper and they had tails and the end of their tail looked like a serpent a snake's head on the end of its sting see it was spiritual horses spiritual Devils Chargers that had been bound and refused all those years Supernatural Devils what was it the old Roman empire being revived and who's over these that guy that was let out the bottom of his pit right I'm going to tell you what come out and I'm going to give you a name I'm gonna explain something everybody know what a heathen is what heathenism is it's a man who don't believe there's God he don't believe nothing he does anything he wants does anybody know what a pagan is he's a heathen that is religious that's what a pagan is so you know Brethren said the worst Devil is a religious devil a paganism is worse than Hedonism that's what he's really telling you so a pagan is a heathen that's religious you know what capitalism is it's when he takes him and puts them in a system brother said papillism is a system under that fifth trumpet what started where people started churches started a under the Pentecostal system 50 denominations come out of it false Unity is everybody got what I'm saying they all say underneath that Pinnacle if you speak in tongues you have the bat that ain't scripture it's a false Unity under false Doctrine it can't be true Unity if it's not bound on the word I am not going to unite with a message preacher if he's not preaching 100 of the message don't you be unequally yoked together is what the scripture says and these preachers around the message are calling for a Unity how can we have Unity if we got five different faiths right right I see Daniel 70 weeks one way you see it the other that ain't Unity the only Unity you're going to have is if you unite on the word there okay empire being Riot persecution of the Jews they had been bound for nearly two thousand years the river Euphrates came across to the promise a religious set religious Devils right they were the worst kind people that was trying to get the other side do you understand the Germans were one of the most Christian nations on the face of the earth when this happened you know why they killed the Jews what they'll tell you because the Jews killed Jesus doesn't that sound sweet now I don't know about you that sounds pretty sweet to me they did kill Jesus the Romans didn't kill them the Jews did pilate said I put him in your hands what do you want to do with him they suffered a Roman judgment but the Jews had them in their heads they could have let him go as a nation they cried out and said we reject him right is that the word exactly okay and the Germans were right Luther do you know Luther the messenger said that the Jews were Antichrist you know who most Germans were Catholics and lutherans kind of easy for him killing Jews off you know they killed our savior looks real sweet almost like this Unity the faith they're preaching now it looks good but it ain't no Unity if we're not saying the same thing better watch it a religious act that was trying to get the other side of Euphrates you know come through Eden they were close to Eden they're close to the promised land you agree but they were bound there 200 000 Devils of persecution brother Brandon's telling us what they are next quote notice what happens under that six trumpet the return loose on Jews persecute use Supernatural Devils nearly two thousand years then loosed by Stalin Hitler upon the Jews you say well that is a Rome it's the same Spirit exactly hmm they've done the same things they did to Christians in the old Pagan Roman Pagan Roman days now watch the natural Israel and the spiritual church now as we separated here turn loose on the Jews you remember the Sixth Seal how every one of those Martyrs are calling according to word of God received robes under the fifth seal that wasn't just the the Jews that were killing I mean that goes all the way back to the start of the church ages if they were blinded in part and they lived a true Jewish life they were truly Israel God put them under the because they were most of them were martyred did you know that I go show you Jews were martyred way back there they were put under six seal or fifth seal they were given robes the Bible says here under that trumpet right six trumpet hey what are you talking about right I put here my quote six trumpet fifth and sixth seal right because the fifth seal is a martyr seal did those Hunter did those six million Jews get martyred you agree now I'm gonna tell you remember that quote logo it said a pre-tribulation they also died under tribulation yeah Brother Brad is calling that the pre-tribulation everybody see what I'm saying that World War II that was a pre-tribulation the fifth and sixth trumpets been let out persecution everybody got what I'm saying loosed on the Jews and that's to drive them back to their Homeland right does everybody agree with that yeah but brother babe say it's a little amateur or pre-tribulation now I'm going to tell you the fifth and sixth Trump would have it quit sounding look they killed those Nazi soldiers you don't kill those spirits the only time a spirit is going to get killed is that the Lake of Fire right that's before the white Throne judgment when the lake of fire comes in because those Devils have already been tried those Spirits were already in hell God don't have to try them over again that'd be double jeopardy wouldn't it God already seen and found him into hell he'd already judged it right do you agree yeah so what he's going to do is throw them he said he throw the devil and his angels in the Lake of Fire the white Throne judgment will come and then he'll throw those that didn't receive eternal light them into the Lake of Fire the lake of fire comes before the white Throne judgment go read your Bible they have Jews who absolutely is against Christ and everything the reason they are is because the Bible said they are blinded and they were blinded for your sake right Bible and just God knows that they would receive it but they were made blind for your sake there's that piece of trumpet you see where he's preaching this now where were those let out where were they in the sixth trumpet where's he preaching it Feast of trump everybody agree he's preaching at the right place he said but I preach those trumpets under the Sixth Seal which was the tribulation seal those Sia trumpets were open during the time of pre-tribulation does everybody understand that but there's an interval between that Trump the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet he says there's an interval he and he shows you the intervals the seventh chapter didn't I read it what is he does he stops those four angels from interrupting nature he stops them but he lets that fifth and sixth Angel go does everybody understand that that's what I read there's that Roman Empire bound there by what the ecclesiastical Powers which Rome Pagan religious room you see what I mean paganism you remember what I said he said Heathen is religious rough Pagan room becomes people Rome right right so you got from Hedonism you go to paganism you go to papalism exactly and papalism is just nothing but a Unity of people under one organization that's what was happening when back then you agree they were kind to come over one world order a long time ago that ain't a new statement the devil tried to do it under Nimrod when he had Babylon oh yeah yeah that Spirit was hatched out in Genesis don't kid Brother Sam every Spirit was born there it was bound there in its traditions of Christian what part of Christian in the superstitions it had of Rome putting together all these worship of women yeah yeah go to go sell a rigid tool and they'll put a woman with a bikini or sell the tool all right he'll tell me we don't worship women nobody have a car wreck looking at the tool they want to buy hey what does a woman have to do with a rigid tool worship of women in this hour and all these other kind of stuff now I'm gonna get rough I told you I was in Christmas days he's talking about a feast Trump he's telling you about that papalism spirit that was launched okay and holidays and holy days and things that's been bound with that tradition that it cannot let loose because it's against Christian principles that's what he said still the same ungodly Pagan spirit and that Spirit caught into the nations of the world according to the prophets of Ezekiel and the rest of them remember romanism goes through all the toes oh yeah right right all of them right is that what it says okay let's read on and they were loosed upon a Jew who know nothing of the spirit there's your Mysteries they said under the seal there see notice it we went through it and I'll show you this trumpet here this last trumpet what takes place there they are these trumpets are let loose on the Jews don't you didn't don't you see not on the Gentiles the Gentile when them seals was open is sealed away time has ended the church ages called Next quote okay we've seen the star okay brother sister how nice it would be if each one of you if each one of us us me if each one of us could lay aside all this Christmas tinsel C quit all the swapping gifts one with another and all this nonsense in the world now I'm not saying this I'm reading it if you're gonna argue this you argue with him and just take off your pride and lay it down and stop the thing underfoot say Lord Jesus guide me to the perfect light watch something Supernatural happen the holy spirit will come in a phenomenal way yeah he said it Revelation 11 7 listen to this now I told you under the spirit of the fifth and brothers preaching this in the Feast of trumpets he knows that Spirit that's come out and I'll be quite honest with you Brethren see something under these trumpets and under the seals he hadn't seen previously I'll use the word Progressive he's progressed alone he's seen some Spirit come out and he's identifying under Feast of trumpet what these Spirits are that come out now you can you can believe it you can ignore it it's yours I'm going to read it you decide what you're going to do with it okay and when they had finished their testimony the Beast that had sent it out of the bottom of his pit see he did yeah I wasn't guessing when I said he'd come out the Destroyer abandoned apollyon she'll make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them that's those two prophets remember chapter 11. and they're dead bodies shall lie in the street in the great city which spiritually call Sodom Egypt where also our Lord was crucified and they they are the people and the killers of tongues and they shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies be put in the grave and they shall dwell upon the Earth Rejoice over them and make marriage shall send gifts one to another why not they already got the spirit am I right he said it I didn't he said swapping gifts he said let's grow up come on people it's what I'm gonna say something you clean it up okay it's Christ Mass it's a Catholic that came out of paganism Pagan Rome come into papal Rome papal Rome took that Christmas and tried to make it something special when it ain't nothing but a pagan it ain't even a Christian principle that's what he said people I didn't swapping gifts look they're going to do it there the spirit of that see what it brings forth they're going to kill two witnesses and they're going to swap gifts for it why not I said they already got Spirit on them they already got that Pagan Spirit on them see that's what was loose down the river you're afraid I'm gonna be honest with you I'm gonna just lay it out that's all I know to do look when I was a kid they'd start putting the Christmas stuff out what about December 1st now after Halloween October the 30th you start seeing Christmas trees in it it's just inundated with this paganism stuff all over the place you didn't see that in your show me Christmas in the early church I'll challenge anybody we're going to fight about the water baptism water baptism was changed under that early papal Church where do you think that stuff come from we need to get we need to get away from that stuff I'm gonna be I don't know I'm gonna preach it you we need to grow up we get we need to swallower a pride like he said step on that thing let's move up Pentecostal feasts past the big 50 days has passed over Pentecostal Feast has passed over seven sabbaths until the trumpets a type of the seven Church age you know what I said you go remember under the Sixth trumpet are you listening on the sixth trumpet the Pentecostals reject the Bible exactly exactly you tell me the sixth trumpet ain't open he says it is when they reject the Bible what he shut outside the church he said after the Pentecost did he say after that when they rejected him in 19 what is it 63 later in the year brother Ram said I indict this generation right for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ what was it they took him out of Jesus ain't in the church anymore here's a quote we say he ain't in the churches who are they worshiping it ain't worshiping Jesus because remember he stands on the outside knocking to get in that he's in the bride age he I won't say he's in the 50s the Jubilee seven sevens his church eight we're in a jubilee people right does everybody agree with what I'm saying yeah okay the sixth terms of Pentacles reject the Bible lukewarm the only Pentecost is all the rest right the church World rejects Christ and he is put on the outside and in the same truck but same seal rather when it was open just so Jesus on the outside church trying to get back in same time the trumpet sound for the Jews and the Jews recognize the atonement right okay the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2000 years but it's loosed in the evening time by the evening time message right right the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh that's the revealing of the son of man that's Saint Luke 17 30. under the Sixth Seal just before the seventh is open right we had and the only way you can make this work if you understand that free or amateur tribulation because he said it's between the six I'll read the Q I go on and I don't know how long I got it's it's 4 30. about over Oregon okay I'm gonna end it clear quick rest of the quotes okay I say between the six and seventh seal God sends a prophet right between the sixth and seventh seal God sends two witnesses between the sixth and seventh trumpet God brother in places between the sixth and seven Trump and the six and seven seal himself and the two witnesses is that right you're saying true you guys know it let's go let's go up to where it says the seventh and I'm gonna I'm gonna sum it up and we'll get out here I talked about Matthew remember see between between brother and places this interval he shows us exactly where it's at he froze those first four trumpets until those two prophets get on the scene those two prophets get on the scene that fifth and sixth trumpet is still sounding right I can prove to you by the scripture that after those two prophets are dead the second woe finishes what was let out in World War II World War II don't end until after those two die right those Spirits don't die does everybody understand that right those two hundred thousand thousand demons are still here and they take those six those arrested the Jews to the those two witnesses to the Grave come on that's what he says go look at where the woes are right uh uh is that where it says the seven trumpet yeah okay and the seventh angel silent there was great voices in heaven saying listen to what it says the kingdoms not Kingdom it's not just talking about the Jews cannot say it it's over redemption's over right the kingdom of this world have become the kingdoms of my God after those two and a half Witnesses die after the second woe the salmon seal the two prophets opened the seventh seal brother Ram said it's the coming of the Lord to Israel right even he says the seventh church had come between the sixth and seventh seal that's true Brothers here when he came there's two prophets are here when that seventh one comes and he redeems the 144 000 redemptions over for the world they'll not I'm gonna be honest after that there will not be another one saved it's over is that what the salmon seal says Brothers the kingdoms of this he didn't say Kingdom it didn't say the nation of Israel said kingdoms of this world will become the keys of our Lord and he shall reign forever and ever amen that's the end of the three and a half go up let's go I'm sorry seven vials come up after that oh yeah once those those 144 000 die of judgments gonna strike the entire Earth brother said those two witnesses call those plagues down on the Gentiles huh did he say that yeah now I'm gonna be honest with you I'm gonna say something here when they start calling them four down if there's any Jews straggling you know there's still six million Jews in America if he calls those first four do what drove Israel back to their Homeland plagues what drives them out plagues it's exactly typed in the Old Testament do you see what I'm saying God ain't gonna let none of those 144 thousand die until they got to seal all right everybody okay with what I'm saying right man that's what he's using the plagues for to move them right her great voice said to him say the same and go your ways and pour out the vials of Wrath remember they say brother I say last plagues the Feast of the trumpets is different than the last plagues the feast the trumpets as plagues going to the Jews to drive them back okay but the interval between that is dealing with he he types it as the bride he types it as the church and 104 in that irritable time they are all those three entities here aren't they I see why brother Graham could use that scripture the way he did I don't know of anybody else could put it together that perfect do you yeah so these vials go to the sixth vial sorry guys I really am I don't mean to take this long we need to start placing it right here I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth the Beast now the mouth of false prophet go down go down the quotes now uh the three unclean spiritses the three isms let me type it for you now and you'll see where it is where it started where it began there was communism Fashions Matthew they were Spirits communism is Spirit it gets on you see it's anything with ISM on it is a spirit denominationalism is a spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a spirit that gets off on you it's the Holy Spirit right okay that really is he says now he says he talks about communism he said that really isn't it he says like that but it'll be three Spirits just like that which they were kind of a forerunner go up but it's the three Spirits just like wind up in communism right right remember the three Nazism fascism wind up in communism okay look brother Brown says I'm gonna highlight Judaism on a rejecting of Christ that's another Spirit Judaism right but who kills those 144 000 Jews who killed Jesus Jews right everybody agree with what I'm saying right he said let our blood be upon us and our children let us die just like he did they will their own brother will kill them sure will what's the third one Catholicism there's your three unclean frogs right that's the sixth going up let's go to the seventh vial don't have it good go down no you're going the wrong way the other way other way we'll have to end it here I know you be seven last plague Seven Seals three woes two young clean and that comes through that there's your Daniel 70 weeks people right now how are you going to get all that in three and a half years when the other vials are bypassed that is it the truth is the Bible says that or am I not these preachers says are only three and a half years they need they don't even know their Bibles we need to grow up we need to we need to say what's set on tape does everybody agree with that okay I'm through God bless you God bless you buddy is that evening let's give our brother let's stand together we'll go right on the end of the communion
