and Lord most of all forgive our sins and make us to be clean in your side we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen Zachariah for we read this the other day but listen there's something I miss quoted it in a little bit so I'll correct that as we go through into the thought but let's reread the scripture and start with that Zachariah 4 and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what's this doubt and I said I have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps their own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one on the right side of the bowl and and the other up on the left side thereof so I answered and spake unto the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord not like I said the other day he's shown these things why would he be thinking you know about it and say well Lord what are these because he's a prophet and he knows something is going to come forth our God is dealing with him you know to bring out something so he then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said Lord no my lord the answered and spake unto me saying now he tells me what this exactly is this is the word of the Lord under unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who aren't the old great mountain before is rule that shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of the rouble have laid the foundation of this house now he's getting back to a house getting up to doing the buildings knowing what's going on right the hands of aruba will have laid the foundation of this house and his hands shall also finish it and I shall know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of the ruble with those seven there are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth okay you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I want to kind of speak tonight if I can on to get our thoughts in a line of something that as I was doing with we're reading in Scripture and it says you know he showed him these things and any asking said what are these things well why didn't he answer him back well it's the lampstand as to this as to that it's why didn't he answer him back that away because see that's not the way God deals God deals with his prophets in a special way to show him the scriptures and times and so he those and asked him again and what are these and he said now this is the word of the Lord that came unto his ruble all right now we know the whole story are the story part of Zerubbabel you go back in this is the restoration of the temple alright coming back in to manifestation wait I remember your a few years ago spoke on this line and went through it and I remember back dark in Ezra you'll find where it was starting and the the King Cyrus made a decree now that King was a hearing King he wouldn't a Christian he wouldn't you know a believer you know but God laid on his heart and what about a king now that they had defeated a country totally wiped it out kind of sounds like America in a way because you know we got that because we went over and destroyed Japan and in Germany and everything then went back and rebuild it you know so get that thought into your mind what the king was to do it the King says now I'm just gonna build a temple you go that and you take everything you need I'll supply you the money the gold everything and you go build this temple for your people know that don't you think I kind of believe that fellers gonna be in glory don't you I kind of believe God's gonna honor that man's dedicated nough Stu try to get a people to sit back to that place and he tells as Ray said now if you need anything just tell him to take it out of my bank account in other words he gives you the right to use all of the thing and he said I'll give you all of the gold the instruments the things and it lists it through Azra and going on through you know and so on how that there to to build a temple and when they got the temple built everything was to be put back in the temple that Nebuchadnezzar had taken out and cured down to Babylon and he's giving him everything now what a wonderful wonderful thought of it that you could just stop there and see how much that God he is to the basis that when he start dealing with a man's heart a man goes back there to to Abraham you know and and when he demanded was gonna fix to Mary Abraham's wife and everything you know when God says now you do that and your dad he says no Lord you know now you know that integrity of my heart Lord you know I didn't know anything about this and the Lord we know straighten it all up because that was what he was gonna do but the point is God can deal with heathen people and do things you know and take care of it and all like that well we shouldn't worry about our things you know I mean when they when when Ezra come in and that King told him said okay you know he called him in to him said I won't talk to you know and he calls him and he says I want you to do something for me and Ezra says well what do you want you know we're at your command we're your slaves we're you know here he said now you're not gonna be a slave anymore and there's a prophecy well what do you mean he said cuz I'm gonna set you to a position since you're going back over there and you're gonna rebuild that temple and said you're gonna do all these things and he says well Oh King why he said because it's just from my heart this from my heart I want to do it well if he can take an old king when I try to make it do it how much more should he do with each one of us all right now that's the point I want you to think about I want the children to think about it like this because it's kind of been in my mind that we talk about headstone cornerstone you know this or that or the other and we we talk about candlesticks and and a lot of you know what we're talking about but a lot don't because they've never been taught maybe what this is and what that is just remember one thing when you're reading these things they're that it is God working out his plan of salvation you know and what a wonderful God that he is to think of us to set aside all of these things for us and we could just rejoice in it you know and think about it and when we talk about Cornerstone headstone we'll see it's not a stone no more than what a red door that he says now what are these things you know he's showing him plan left stands he showed him candlesticks he showed him all kind of you know the two olive trees and the thing and he said well what are all of these things and he said this is the word of the Lord how about summing up all of the wonderful things that had been spoken there in Zechariah with that statement that this is the word of the Lord that has come to Zerubbabel all right now Zuba belen the natural was like a governor etc some kind of a high-ranking official with with Israel you know more than just a normal little person but he had a job to do and and he took all of these things and started doing it and all of that speaks of us when you read that Old Testament and you see a wheel in the middle of the wheel of of maybe Ezekiel you know and you'll see this happening and and you'll see that happening remember children that it's God expressing to us his plan of salvation when it comes down it's not treason and lapsed hands and those are just the things that are put there to help us and give us understanding it's really talking about you and me it's bringing us to the plan of salvation of God to us as you know as his people all right so children keep that in mind and in when we say Cornerstone remember the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the chief Cornerstone he we're built on the foundation of apostles and prophets there in Ephesians Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone well now then it's not a cornerstone like a building or this that's that's just natural things that's natural parts that are made and done to show us spiritual things the the cornerstone of a building is the part of a building where you put your anchor or start it forth we'll see our whole anchor is in Jesus Christ and that's what it's talking about cornerstone see that it's in Jesus Christ being revealed because it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to you and me all right and then when we say headstone it's just simply more of what was revealed about Jesus Christ to us see it moves from a corner to a head and since it's like in the building we talked about in the pyramids or whatever then the cornerstone would be the cornerstone of it the headstone it's the same stone it's just a way of expressing it it's still revealing that much more because the whole church is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ so - - just think about it when you say cornerstone headstone you say that's talking about Jesus Christ that's you know that's revealing Christ - you and I and bringing it out to where we can follow it and understand it and you know and it's not just say well words we hear this and we hear that but do do we really know see the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ alright see then whatever you're reading in that way so you can read the Book of Revelations and you can read those things and and see what caught me was we read the Bible we read the book but we didn't have the understanding part and when I first started reading the things the Prophet would say the Book of Revelations was that was wonderful that was you know was upgrading enlightening helping us to understand but one day he said it like this he said that's the acts of a play that the Book of Revelations is the acts of a play I thought hey that breaks it down then is you know in an acts of a play you got to have actors to act out a play and run around said one day we're on the life page you know you remember that we're on the live page well there's some things could take place I'll hit it one day we talked of a couple of two or three brothers of it the other night a little bit and we'll get down into it one of these days and speak a little bit about some of those things but it's not just our horse riding a black horse or red horse or pale horse me that's what God is looking down and seeing mankind as they look like to him you know and it's not like a King Kong beast running across you know my brother-in-law's a Baptist preacher that's that's what he thinks it is I said well ain't much deceiving in that you know I mean he ain't going to see nobody were very big the east us it's got to be something deceiving you know well see that's just symbolic orthology so the whole Bible is that away see when we say Jesus was the cornerstone well we don't mean he was just put in somewhere and made in a building part it's a revelation of Almighty God that was revealed to mankind through Jesus Christ standing on the earth right all right C then the headstone would just be more revelation or the complete revelation or the finish or whatever you want to bring it to perfection and it would it helps us then to understand these things see we can go from here in Zachariah to the Book of Revelations and and look in it and and see how that you know the things fit together but remember and that's what I was doing I got a point I figured somebody catch me and say hey wait a minute you said that wrong well I'll straight up long thing in a minute but you know see to show you the difference or the way we go a lot of times in our thinking and God does it it mentions a lampstand in Zechariah it mentions - in relation me because it just opens up to more understanding all right and see we look at those things and sometimes we get confused but just simply read backwards or forth around it you know and it's all a revelation of Jesus Christ when you're reading the Bible read that Bible as God speaking to you he's talking to you he's revealing himself to you he is the word and all of it's a word we'll get to it in a minute where the Prophet is talking about the Word of God and what it is to all of us it's God speaking to us and see we read it as like we read like the Ten Commandments and we'll get to that in a minute and mention it but we read it like that's a buckaroos well it's a revelation of the person of Jesus Christ well I just don't see how that can be cause you're reading wrong I used to mentor brother Gary Atkins he he'd always you know he had a way of coming up with things you know and he'd say now he said we read the Ten Commandments like this nor shalt not kill thou shalt not steal you know meaning and error good and hateful and said that's the way we think it say it but said if you read it a little different and read it thou shalt not kill that's not my steal it comes forth in a different understanding right do you get it it makes a different understanding of things it becomes from a hateful arrogant God that we think is saying thou shalt not kill although I'll kill you for killing them see instead of it being that away it turns out to be love revealed that's the whole word that that's been on my mind to say that part to her you know because I realize that we just a lot of times we we just run over things and we we say things and we don't clarify it enough to let the children know what's going on I thank God for the Sunday School classes where they can be exposed to these things and and talk about Jesus Christ in their lives and their ways and their doings because that's what it's all about it's about the revelation of Jesus Christ okay all right now so we've read the scripture from Zechariah all right and in reading that scripture we we did and I was actually mind running about two miles ahead of mouth and you know I thought maybe some of you would pick up the thought and come back to me to say and say well brother Dale you said that was that wouldn't write said because we know that verse seven I see is that right let me get it back this is the word of the Lord under the rubble saying not by might nor power by that spirit saith the Lord who are at our old great mountain before is ruined I shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace unto it now this is arou beable is going to bring forth the headstone all right now it's a ruble not is not God he's the prophet but that's an example now keep zerubabbel in mind as an example of the last day prophet alright and what took place in our day and has taken place and you're going to see a little something here that random save something that sounds a little bit funny it's like if he's not a he doesn't say the word exactly right but he does when you bring it down to you and me when you bring it down to her that this is arou verbal represents the end time messenger the seven churches messenger will read it in a second and showing that all right so we read here it says that he'll what he'll bring forth the headstone all right so then he's gonna have something to do with the headstone coming all right more verse 8 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Jubilees the foundation of this house his hands also shall finish it yeah he's gonna lay the foundation okay are they the whole thing because that's what he done you get the story from Ezra them so ruble is the first one mentioned in in Ezra and he is the chief and he goes and they a bunch of them goes with him he goes down and he starts doing the works and things if you'd get that message of way back about what three four years ago something like that and and it shows the the point to each one you know of do it but what I said was see now the scripture says here in verse seven verse six excuse me makes you giddy right we're going somebody on Titan to go back and listen to it verse seven says that this is aruba bull okay he shall bring forth the headstone daro shouting grace grace unto it now I like that because I like what brother Brennan said one day he said my whole makeup is great and see the hips don't ain't gonna come for counting rules and regulations it ain't gonna be cutting ironed dress and clothes and stuff you know because that ain't even the cornerstone we're gonna get to that in a minute see that ain't it's not even the cornerstone but random didn't have to come to try to tell the women how to dress your had enough sense to know how to die if you're born again Christian if you're a born again Christian York nota had to been told how to dress well it was the custom of the day when I didn't think Christianity fit into the custom of the day all right but now when the way brother Branham says this and I'm gonna read what he says so that you get to point of the reason I'm saying that I brought her I said he would not he would wrinkle it's the cornerstone but he wouldn't bring the headstone all right that was a slip of the tongue that was back on October the 28th that I made a slip of the tongue I go back and listen to my own messages two and three and four times sometimes because I want to make sure that my wording is right because I'll be responsible for that all right and I noticed it on there that I said that he would not bring the headstone well the Bible says he will all right well now I've got a quote from brother Branham says that he didn't bring the cornerstone but the Bible says he did now what we're gonna do we're gonna have to see something he's talking about because we don't we're confused all right so we'll just read what he said cuz see verse verse seven said he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings green grace grace verse nine in the hands of drew will have laid the foundation of this house so remember some things that took place did Giroux beable relay the cornerstone I'm gonna say this before I read the quote from the Prophet did he necessarily relay the cornerstone because David Wright Solomon Solomon was the one credited with starting the building right and see Solomon built the temple all right they tore it down but did Solomon come back you know I mean there's this zhirova we'll come back to the land and say okay the temple was up yonder but I think he'd be better down here now do you get that Giroux bull wasn't that way he was a prophet he was hunting exactly were to put the foundation and I believe the foundation was exactly layed on exactly the same place and not one inch out of measurement from the original by Solomon that's just my point he see because of something that brother George Smith said to me when we was in Israel and Reuben the God you know was kind of a talking and something and then he had come up and brother George spoke to me later about it and he said you know that those Jews are dependent upon Elijah to show them were to build the temple you see then I've checked it with Reuben you know and with my own understanding and listening brother branham and everything see because that building can't be something different it's got to be exactly right and see they're looking for Elijah if you understand the Old Testament people they are looking for Elijah to proceed Moses in your two witnesses see they think Elijah is going to come before Moses and Elijah would be able to tell him exactly were to put that temple and Reuben said to me one day and he said Sam he pointed to a brick and lament in the wall or blocks that had been laid into the wall you know and covered up a door he says there is no thoughts about where to put the temple he said it's right behind our they begin to understand that things are getting into the right order but they're waiting on the lives you to tell them me about this where to put it all right think about that now now let's read and then I'll show you worth it I made the mistake and I'm going to correct my own mistake so then that way you know it won't be a problem it may not mean a thing to you but it means a lot to me so I go ahead number number two brothers and let's pick it up this is from the message of grace preached in 61 827 all right we're all acquainted with the scripture that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zerubabbel was a great prince among the people now watching who laid the foundation of the building now keep it in your mind but around City laid the foundation now listen to it and now you I want you to put on your spiritual thinking or northing jacket this morning as we think this Great Prince had determined to rebuild a house of God and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone how much it and as we read on father we find out that God said the robe will has laid the foundation with his hands he also show bring forth the headstone I want you to notice what's him he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he said he'll bring forth the headstone now you got him up twice above there that he lays the foundation you got the scriptures that he laid the foundation hmm why would a prophet say now run that back down where we make sure and keep up with it the other way oh don't wait for y'all and as we read further on Giroud will laid the foundation with his hand but he also shall bring forth the headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he shall bring forth the headstone see that quote was in my mind and I crossed it between headstone corners that's all I've done and when you listen to the tape you probably won't pay that much attention to it but it is technical to me because the Bible said he laid he would bring forth the headstone but the Prophet said it didn't say he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone now what's he saying he's the Prophet what is this point okay so let's keep reading and we know that the scripture said that Jesus was the chief Cornerstone and he's also that's time now if we'll take a few minutes that the 7th church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the father's and watch him in other words rebuild the temple the church again under the power of the Spirit not much power I might but by my spirit saith the Lord not by organization not by denomination by the Holy Spirit will bring forth the church in the last days and I watch him the ruble the Prince with Joshua now that's the difference Joshua from from your Joshua of Moses and Joshua okay this is on onover okay but it is he's the name is dark but there's a different one sure over the prince was Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone and what's he he had laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation in top they took him back in top all right so now get what I'm talking about see Jesus Christ laid the cornerstone he is the cornerstone were built Ephesians were built on the foundation apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone all right he was that stone he's also the head stone but why would the prophets say now he didn't say to bring forth the cornerstone one of the cornerstone didn't have to be brought back you remember I emphasized over and over and over to you now listen I emphasize over and over that in the church ages no church age was left without the new birth so no matter how much the bug ate away and even brother Brown said he elite to life but remember you can't take away the new birth you remember that I am beside it over and over you can't take away the new birth each church age had the new birth all right what was eight away was what the bug ate of the faith of the fathers what Peter named had brought forth and they'd brought forth through got four ages that they held with that stature of a perfect man and I were Colombian with her doctor they held to that truth of the God until the field church age and then it died and went in the ground why do you see what the prophets talking about see he takes them back to the foundation and taught the rubra bull didn't as I said didn't have to go over there he had to hunt the place but once he found the place he knew the corner if he had to build in to lay it out in you were exactly where he's at so he could build that temple he could do as the scripture says then he would lay the foundation he lays the foundation all right but then he takes it back to that foundation and that's what brought around I'm done little random come to bring us the faith of the fathers he didn't have to relay the cornerstone he just took us back to the cornerstone he took us back to the word zerubabbel when once he got there he probably spent days search him you know some of them probably said okay hey we're running short on time then guys will probably come over here and take away our our good property thing we better get at it we'll just start right here he said no just leave me alone for a little bit because God had already spoke to me back here a prophet knows where the cornerstone is at the Prophet knows where the foundation is that a prophet knows how to build a building the Prophet company was all built under the prophet Moses but it was laid out in curtains and stuff like that with Moses there were no concrete foundation but when Solomon come forth and just remember Solomon was the one that rebuilt a temple but remember David was Dhara are you with me David was there for quite a while David got everything ready he laid everything out Oh Joshua had all Solomon had to do was just start putting it together right now are you listening he listened the point of what I'm saying see my thoughts was in that line and that's why I made the statement because I knew there was a statement that the Prophet had made about it and he says it in the message there he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone he didn't say that he said in other words he's going back to the foundation he relayed the foundation for what was needed and the temple was built upon that foundation I believe that foundation was to the tea and to the inch because they didn't play around over them things when you can build a pyramid in Egypt that has no shadows night or day whatever you know and it's all to the my new fraction and that pyramid in Egypt is built upon your your what is it what does it call power Squier your somebody say that word or what it is I didn't get it see PI R square is one point one form so cilantro it's it's the German measurement metrics metrics is involved when you get down to where the pyramid was built yeah and that's why it comes forth with your measurements and it's to the T that it's sitting perfectly for the world all the way around my point is why don't you think David was led of God don't you think he said I can't do it what he said Solomon you get ready to do the work I'm gonna walk this thing off for you and you put that cornerstone right here now don't move it an inch put that cornerstone it's all of them right here don't you think Solomon followed his order you understand what I'm getting at the perfection that God has that he brought through the Prophet the Prophet knew exactly were to put the temple so did is removal when he went back he knew exactly where to put that foundation but notice the Prophet said 'no said he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone why because the cornerstone is Jesus Christ you don't have to relay that that's a natural temple that they had to relay had to do everything this is a spiritual temple this is a temple that was built on the day of Pentecost in the upper room when the Holy Ghost fell and as it did then it brought mankind down through and we're built upon not a building to threaten some work that's just the accuracy of Almighty God we're built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the cornerstone and wasn't it one of those apostles that jesus said who the man say I the Son of Man and whether the issue that you don't know you know and who do you say Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and what did Jesus say back to him he said upon this rock I'll build my church that rock that stone has never been destroyed the cornerstone was never destroyed I'm talking about spiritual cornerstone I'm talking about in the Bride of Christ every age was built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone and the build on the revelation of Jesus Christ every age is built upon that when Luther come out with that just shall live by faith that was a marvelous thing because it was a starting back to work that it would bring forth the truth so you follow me that's what brother Branham see by reading the scriptures he read the scriptures that we read he read the headstone will be brought forth by zerubabbel he read that the foundation would be laid by saruba bull right he knew that but then when it fence poses over into our day or into the new testament he said he took him back in top well because they laid everything back ik perfectly the way it was when that temple was brought forth over there it was put exactly where it was supposed to be to the my new each you know because God was directing his prophet and what's more can we depend upon this these things that this prophet has brought a statue of a perfect man adoption you know who who is God and what is this and you know the redemptive plan brought by this man but just remember that when brother Branham cuz this is the point I'm trying to get you to see why the Prophet said that he says now it doesn't say he shall bring forth the cornerstone because he brother Branham never had to bring the cornerstone he had to replace it it's kind of like a brother said at my house one day and I knew his doctrine and he was sitting there trying to explain some things too and I said yeah I know y'all say that you swept off the foundation so that was their doctor they said brother Branham laid the foundation but they had to sweep it off and clean it up straighten it up some of you may remember him and they had to lay the foundation themselves and build the building I said well the hard part about it is you say you going out beyond the profit yeah cuz that's what we've done we went beyond we we swept off all we had to sweep out what the problem said cause he laid a lot of it wrong in other words that a little we flip it off okay and said we're gonna build a building I said well they ain't but one problem with that he said what is that I said well brother branham you say you go beyond brother branham yeah I said brother branham priestess in a future home don't know if you're gonna tell me anything started - future home boy he shut up cuz he knew he was proud he couldn't move nowhere go where would you go you can't go no farther than the future home that was the prophets message they couldn't say they was gonna tell her something I said tell us past a future home oh he was smart anything he said oh you the future here is a tell us about the seals I said I'll tell you nothing about anything time I said code I ain't worried about it I just know for certain you ain't got nothing cuz you can't put it in the message in other words you can't tell me something run around them didn't I say to make me better or to change my body or whatsoever because you went to the future home you understand what I'm getting at why would the Prophet say I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone tell brother branham never brought forth the cornerstone the disciples brought the cornerstone that was the foundation of Jesus Christ built upon the apostles and what they told there's your whole foundation it's what they told see Jesus is that cornerstone he didn't out to be relate all he had to do is just bring them back if the Prophet said he brought him back to it in time what does he mean by top he brought him back to it in what it was supposed to be all right so then the prophets right see because he says now zerubabbel the prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth the headstone he had laid the foundation watch him he took the people back to the foundation in top and when you're getting a type of something now somebody help me with the scriptures maybe but you should know what but anyhow when Elijah was over there and he built that altar you remember the next challenge him and he built the altar he got everything fixed and he built the altar and he said okay now you cry you cry out to your garden let's see they cried out all day long finally he said this yet and said by the way go help me said pour some water all in this little track that's around here and said just run it all over and said just pour it over the offering pour it over the wood right you remember that in the screws yeah I had a while he said now Lord let the people know now somebody catch that scripture and said let the people know what then he turned her heart back missing the Old Testament that's when it said there about Elijah he said let the people know Lord that you turned her heart back what in time in time they returned to God to walk with him with Elijah see of a type of the end time to were that we walk in the message of the hour we don't need somebody to sweep off and do this and do that and don't worry about it see because in the Old Testament you had Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph right the foundational stone right and then who built the body who who built that building the prophets the prophets built the body John being the life's one come to introduce the head am i right am I in the scripture that's the way your prophet describes it all right you can see Elijah said let it be known you got it first Kings 1837 then let it be known that their heart I believe that singular in it their heart is turned back because it comes down to one heart instead let it be known they stood back there in top of you and me because here's where we're coming back to the original that's why it took bread around them so long to come and do it so there's your your scripture did I am the servant and that I have done all these things that I word hear me O Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God and that thou has turned there heart back again then the fire fail you want the fire to fall let's just get back to the profit and the way he said it because he said things that I said sometimes he said things that sounds odd why would the man read the scripture it was a ruble and knowing in that scripture that zerubabbel was to bring forth the headstone but knowing also that he was to bring forth the foundation then the Prophet turns and says what he never said he shall bring forth the cornerstone you can do all you won't do and think how you want to the revelation of Jesus Christ is what the bride is built on that's what we've got to be built on what those apostles taught there is your foundation and there is your corner which Jesus being the chief Cornerstone there he was right in what they say and there is your cornerstone the cornerstone is supposed to have within it all the things that's made within the building is all set out and described in your cornerstone because that's where it's all got it tied to you see what brother Branham he never had to relay that he didn't go get something new he went right back when he started out he went right back to the apostles and prophets and said dyers the cornerstone there's the foundation and said now what we need to do is just build the building and see he could see that even the church ages the emember statue of a perfect man brother Brennan said this shows that the individual comes forth and he said as the individual come forth he said to church come forth the same way so of the Old Testament Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph was that foundation the prophets built the body and Jesus Christ stepped out upon their would John would it not be the same in the end time through the church ages the church started off when was doing great wonderful they were really building a good building within all at once about the fifth church age 13 Aires was called the Dark Ages of time Satan come forth and started tearing that building down right see it had never got to the place of the introducing of the headstone that's why the headstone was rejected in the church ages time you get to the fifth church age your headstone had totally been lost they didn't have any understanding of God they didn't have any understanding of the cornerstone because the cornerstone is the faith of the Father right so what was lost in the church ages 5 6 & 7 what was lost the stature of a perfect man the adoptions the things the Prophet had to come and preach to us to bring Jesus Christ back and see look what he had to do no wonder it took him 30 something years he had to literally go back to the foundation of the apostles and prophets start out from that and rebuild the church well I don't see it something wrong with you then cuz I you're part of it if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I you're part of that building what are you looking for see then as John the Baptist come to introduce Jesus Christ he introduced him as the headstone but they rejected him so he had to become the cornerstone in the temple he had to come down to the cornerstone the Prophet came that had been eaten totally down until it was back down to that original but it wasn't either way that new birth and upon this rock humour what he told Peter remember this is son of man he said who the man say I the son of man I am I'm Peter raptured back the only thing he could answer what is Peter to answering the son of man is he couldn't answer it because he didn't have the revelation so what did he say he said thou art the Christ now come on church don't belittle Peter in what he said for heaven's sake don't belittle God I stood right here years ago and asked one question did buffaloed the people in this building and a lot of you still mad at me til this day because of the statement I made some people left in things because the statement was like what what was the statement I said what was the first form of Almighty God what was the first form well first one the Prophet said of Almighty God you want to call it lo God's theophanies I would just remember what he said it was he said the lo God's theophany was the son of God the Son of God is your first form of God because there's helo gosh you theophany is the son of God if you don't believe that I'll be glad to show you throughout the message read a little bit let you see what I'm talking about because we get our ideas and our thoughts we don't want to accept truth because that just flat went over some of your heading this now I didn't say that brother branham is the one that said it I'll be glad to show you these quote he said that the son of God was the first form God ever had because the Son of God is the creator and that's what Peter said look what Peter announced him the crust wrote around them didn't say if you don't see Jesus in every verse because he knows you can't find Jesus in every verse What did he say if you don't find the Christ in every verse he said go back and read it again cause you missed it dollar the Christ Peter said Peter looked at him literally and was saying you are the create car now What did he say okay you're recognizing me as a creator I'm going to show you that I am what did he turn back to Peter and say he said Peter upon this revelation of what you say it of Who I am I'm gonna build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail the church was built on the revelation of son of God that's why your denominations could never get it right they couldn't understand brother Branham when he would talk about low gosh theophany being son of God there were so much above all of that into their great understandings they couldn't listen to him but the first form of God was the son of God which was the low cost a theophany the word I'll be glad to show you these in the message anybody on the internet if you don't have the ability to run it just run in front of God what you see that's where people think then when you make a statement like that then it blows in their face because everybody was dealing it with it he was the son of man I said don't worry about son of man do you get Son of God straight right son God is the new birth Jesus plainly was saying like I said today and Wade made that statement - I make it and believe it Jesus said to Peter Peter you didn't answer my question because I asked you who was the son of man and you answered who was the son of God but he said I'll come back and I'll declare who the son of man is that's what's so amazing to me oh you you don't know what it does to my heart to think you think I'm just throwing stones or throwing this out the other you show me where Paul ever mentioned son of man you show me where Peter ever mention other than the Matthew Mark Luke and John they're in the scriptures and they were talking of son of man all right but show me in the any of their doctrines where they ever brought forth the son of man right but are you listening to what I said he said Peter go ahead I'll build my church on that rock that you're talking about so that's a revelation of who I am for now I'm the son of God the Christ the create car I said I'll come back one day that son of man 47 is the year we start recording the profit right 47 what did it faith is the substance first title you know and all I care they may have some more now but I'm just giving you that's what looking 48th and brought around started talking about son of man get noticed that brother Branham started talking about son of man let's see you're not listening you think it's sarcasm or arrogance or hateful of me to say it we Baptist knew son of man was the resurrection sign because Jesus said I am the resurrection and under Son of Man the Son of man is the resurrection brother branham picked it up because his message is the resurrection he had to do restorations and things yes back to the foundation of the apostles and prophets but then one day he declared his own message and opened those seals this son son of God is the revealer right son of man is the one who broke the seals not brother branham now don't go how you are with me they done that in 1969 when I taught it in the first message and I told it that the bride would be the son of man I still stand was out of that and I still got the quotes if you want to read them where your prophet said it the bride would be the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the last day and she would be the son of man the Word made flesh old people just looking at me the end of a pitiful I wouldn't quite as pitiful as I thought because that was 69 and I still believe that man what the bride is the Word made flesh now when she climbs her statue a perfect man when she gets into the word that's where she comes out to be not to just say the bride is the son of man see that's you're throwing it wrong you're making me say something I didn't say I didn't say that it's just like I've taught you the new birth the new birth is not because you can quote the word the new birth is when the word is made alive to you by revelation because upon this rock I'll build my church there's a new birth the revelation of Jesus Christ when these seals and things are revealed to the bride and she finds out who she is what did the Prophet say he said when the bride realized who she is and what she here for he said she'll be an invincible army what I just don't see it's doing any good what group would you fit in the Old Testament what group with that attitude would you fit in the Old Testament you couldn't say you were following the prophets because the prophets were building the body of Jesus Christ and John being the chief Cornerstone I mean being the the John coming as the the one to introduce the head which would be the chief Cornerstone as he has to come in the ages where would your doctor and fit with that see I understand all night long and talk about that Old Testament science and how they were bringing forth Jesus Christ who was the fourth man in the fire when that old king heathyr and King looked in there he said didn't we throw forward a three and nine I said yeah he said well a foreigner and says that one is likened to the son of God Viji Scripture in other words the old man had it's no sense to know for certain that if they throwed three in there that kill the others that throw them in and here's the fourth one that just jumped in there of his own accord or was already there or something and it never bothered him at all he'd have to know that he was God and if he could see him he couldn't call him God you don't get that he called him son of God you can't see son of God son of God it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost am i with the Prophet the Holy Ghost the Prophet said let me get this one the Holy Ghost is the only revealer of the word brother Branham could not reveal one thing to you and me but we ain't gonna get it without him so he had something to do with us getting it but he couldn't give it to us you remember the statement Wade likes to make when he gets over to the the questions and answers for that I believe his questions and answers on the seals he said that's gone from you tell me you were sitting there I didn't like the statement you get so upset when he called I read he said it's gone from you and says no way for you to get it but he finishes it up you listen to there's more right there at it he finishes it up but something's gonna take place it's gonna be revealed it's gonna be revealed but you see that's where we can't keep it straight we take the 10 commandments it's a book of rules when the Prophet said it was the revelation of God come on what are we gonna get out of our baby play pins and Rattlers and get on with listening a little he said - 10 commandments What did he say I gave it to you the other day the unveiling of God they pull it up they went to number eight Moses priest and led them out of Egypt and died before the real commandments was laid down the seals was brought in God comes down before the people and prove that Moses was sent from the impact brother Allen could put the seals and the Ten Commandments together because either seals is not a book of rules all right do you want to stay for a little bit let's read let's see for you let me grab something right here in the back okay headstone will come forward crying grace grace amazing grace me now they can going over to number four if they want to because listen to what your prophet calls the Bible therefore it's not a book of man man didn't write the word somebody said it's just some old Hebrew rottens with the Hebrews write a letter that condemned themselves really it's not a book of man it's a book of God and the man who sees the vision or hears the voice of God never understood it many times themselves in many cases because the Word of God is truth there is no other truth there's no other truth can take its place it's all truth the word is God is God in letter form the Bible is not a book of systems I'm going over and just keep on going number seven it's not a book of systems nor a book nor a code of morals the Bible is not a not a book of systems so many systems and so forth no sir it's not a book of morals no sir it is not naari it's a book of history altogether I mean all together our neither is it a book of theology for us a revelation of Jesus Christ is the is the Commandments in the book is the seals in the book well it can't be a book of rules it can't be a book of morals you know what he means moral well we don't cut a higher we don't we don't painter Facebook oh we're great yeah were ordered Moses or not I don't know what you thought not Moses who it the guy that made a golden era word it Aaron get the gold to make the golden guy I'm laying out something that's gonna flop you where did he get the gold that we made them the earrings out of the women the women and men wore earrings oh no brother Dale that was in the Old Testament they didn't wire them earrings will read your Bible they took the earrings out and made the golden cave well we don't believe in wearing everything's do we why why is it wrong for us to wear earrings as they warm you hadn't never thought of that they wore earrings Leah and women why is it wrong for us go run over there and ask them people why it's wrong and they'll tell you it ain't wrong and they'll tell you that the reason I believe it ain't wrong for everybody cause they're men and women know that were worried about you can't argue they did all because of that little word brother branham used well ago where he said he took them back to the foundation in top took them back to the foundation in top right showing that the top was what you know I need to reap resit the top was the fact that God that brother branham never had to come and lay the cornerstone it was dire that was Jesus Christ when he walked out there he was speaking of a God that was real that's what called me oh man I've listened to all the preachers talk about God I had heard them all in their doings and talking and how God was so great to him and all of the things and I had seen God do things as a Baptist I'd seen God move and do things I wanted to find the God of the Bible I talked to those old Baptist preachers the one that was there when we left I asked him did he know William Brennan I had heard of him he said I've heard of him and said I won't say nothing because I see that old Baptist preacher would preach take the saddle I've heard him preach it my wife convert the kids floated too young but he preached take the saddle off with them of the horse and put it under the church if he's gonna pray for rain he was a good old Baptist that believed in the healings and signs and wonders long church but do we think that this message is a book of rules I used to quote it until it was a sister here she laughed at me about it is your wife worthy of the gospel you know there is a direct quote in that message is your life worthy the gospel that literally says your wife were the gospel that sister she lives she said brother Dale I've never heard anybody talk about is your wife worth in the gospel I said that's all everybody thinks they can get the women and straighten up quit cutting the hire quick pint in the face and they're ready for the rapture well why are we doing here 50 years life you know we got Nana's great heritage the women didn't have to worry about cutting her a lot of falling out now you want to worry about it my wife she keeps on going with her going another year or two she's gonna be having to wear a wig because he's losing a lot of her heart the older you get you don't follow okay but listen do you see what I'm talking about see we don't wear earrings because of the top and what is that time what is the top that reason we don't worry tell me a commandment to not wear a ring but the top the top is what faith cometh by hearing and hearing comes through the ear so you don't you're not a slave you're free you get it tops tops brings us to the reality of Jesus Christ now we see why children that we don't worry about why because the world does show and they're sold out to a slave master we're not sold out to slave master we serve the one true and living God what about the two tables of stone the Ten Commandments you know what according to dedication the prophet teaching it the last thing that came in the building now I'm quoting brother Branham he says when they got the building complete he says there wasn't anything in the building but furniture that's whay said with nothing in the building but furniture the last thing to enter the building with what the Ark of the Covenant what was in the Ark of the Covenant the ten commandments what was the last thing to enter the temple the Ten Commandments when they brought it in and said it down took his place what happened to proving it was right what was taking place was correct what happened the Shekinah glory fell till they couldn't even minister you see why church did I believe the way I do you see well you're a funny guy Shekinah glory taken from dedication paragraph 80 there's a kind of glory that followed those capping stone not the corner the capping stone the main thing all other stones was of none effect until them but this main stone came in the headstone and took his place positionally for its resting place for that generation the glory of God filled a house where the people were sitting and there was this Shekinah glory upon the whole building and the glory was so great to a priest couldn't even minister cause of the glory right now read number 12 go ahead you got eleven at number eleven so go to number 12 you may have rest reading this the other day questions and answers 1954 brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year or what all theologies failed to do in two thousand years you wait till they're knowing of the church really strikes home to that faithful the little remnant after the doors of the Gentiles is closed Oh God will anoint a church then he who's filthy let him be filthy still he who's righteous let him be righteous he's holy let him be holy and God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will be taking place not only that then but he's doing it now okay you remember this one that was number 11s cubed number twelve now which what shall I do with Jesus Christ sixty-three 1124 the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body your nots together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the Holy Spirit three kinds of believers sixty-three 1124 that was 1124 morning the 11:24 evening that's the reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that'll take her from the earth in a rapture in grace God promised it God promised it brother Dale you're a funny person do you believe it's gonna be a revival oh no ain't gonna be no more rod ain't no we don't more revival this revival drover I got the quote I got to learn right here on rig 1 read the other one lets you decide okay the third seal 63 320 don't think we've got revivals we haven't oh we got millions and millions and but what millions of church members but not a revival know where I don't know the bride hasn't had a revival yet see there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up he will send it he promised it now now she was was dead alright now he says it's gonna come one now let's read another one going to 15 the invisible union of the Bride of Christ priests in 6511 25 we're trying to relate people to deeper thoughts and higher objections believing that to come to the Lord Jesus is at hand we believe that much more it's 20 years closer than it was the first time I come to shriek oh oh so much has happened since that time now we're looking forward for the coming of the Lord in our generation I'm not looking for a revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation - quotes one said sobriety had a revival and take the Thunder to wake her up the other one said looking for a revival in this generation you know what he's right on both statements most statements is 1,000% right no don't go in my head brother Dale well that's just where you don't think right you don't listen brother branham never looked for a world wide sweeping revival he said the Pentecostals was the last one until the two witnesses come I'll be glad to find these for years okay the two witnesses there'll be a revival it'll cover the world the bride is waiting for a revival at 8:07 on don't honor it's not the world woke up it's the bride the world ain't gonna have a revival mm-hmm but the bride is in a revival because she's in the opening of the word now both arms ride a world wide sweeping revivals not gonna happen no he said that's the two witnesses but then he says if there's a revival to wake the bride up an outpouring of the Holy Ghost to come when the building is completed to be exactly in top like it was back there you see how prophet can say things but if they're not brought out and put together by the Holy Spirit you've got two quotes running in opposite direction you want to stay all night long and by memory see how many by memory that I can remember of the statements he says one thing one way and one thing another what he corrected he corrected what he didn't correct we better believe there's something laying there that's wonderful just like he stated and the Bible stated the rule will bring forth a hitch tongue because he's already laid the foundation then he turns around and says not that cornerstone no see now you see what he's talking about the cornerstone was never eat away the church has still been built every age was built on the foundations apostles and prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone you realize what's taken place and will take place in this day come on musician you realize that what we're saying under this messenger the church will have to be rebuilt the church had to be revealed you want me to quote you want to quote good you know that read around them says what two Methodists well the Baptist eight we're gonna get into that one of these days you realize that what to method this and all them left the Pentecostals a towei who's he talking about she ain't the bride that old Berg is still eating he said you say you've had a lot of rain he says nonsense now that's perforating the quote but it's close he said you ain't had the former yet and I'll throw this because one day they come won't get to former in the latter right brother branham in the part that the Holy Spirit told him pick up his pen and write in that message he said this messenger in the last days would plant by the messenger in the former right that's a direct quote he's now it's lighter right you don't understand this messenger had to do two times he planted for the former Ryan the seals breakin was the latter rain breaking not read he we've had a wonderful message let's stamp all right what do we got 109 Redbook standing on the promises remember to pray for these and then pray for and they traveled no promises of Christ my pearl ages lettuce praises or in the highest I will shout and say I'm standing on promises of God or body but a vanished I'm happy the maxi somebody asked me one day said how do you feel brother daddy backer 69 and saying the bride would leave it sort
