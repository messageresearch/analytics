[0:04] okay all right let's turn to Revelation
[0:08] 6 or you can just read it on the screen
[0:10] if you want
[0:12] to last Sunday's
[0:15] video got corrupted or encrypted or
[0:20] anyway it's in 513 somewhere so we're
[0:23] going to background just a little
[0:25] bit but we do have the audio for it so
[0:28] the audio is online
[0:31] not the
[0:32] video but what we've been talking about
[0:35] we're starting on a study on the seven
[0:38] seal and a few things that we've been
[0:41] talking about good to have a visitor
[0:42] with us today and U brother Joe's
[0:46] grandaughter and all the way walked all
[0:48] the way from California to get
[0:51] here
[0:53] not her first DED
[0:56] there okay all right so what we're
[1:00] talking about is the Seven Seals in the
[1:02] Bible now what did we say the seal was
[1:04] we've established that a seal is the
[1:06] Holy Ghost right you can't
[1:11] understand you can't understand the
[1:14] Bible which is the Mysteries that are
[1:16] contained in the Seven Seals it has to
[1:18] be in the Bible why I've got Bible
[1:20] written in red it always has to come out
[1:21] of the Bible okay so if the prophet got
[1:24] anything he had to get it out of the
[1:26] Bible if you and I get anything we got
[1:28] to get it out of the Bible
[1:30] uh so strange that people worry that we
[1:34] um follow a message of of of an
[1:36] individual well you know individuals all
[1:38] over uh Luther Wesley they don't talk
[1:41] about those people they started the
[1:43] movements and um and everybody talks
[1:45] about Billy Graham everybody talks about
[1:48] um met a man the other day that was a
[1:50] real staunch follower of of Jimmy
[1:53] Swagger well they have a Ministry they
[1:56] have a Ministry that people are that
[1:58] people flop to all right
[2:01] but never did never did a a a person
[2:04] have a
[2:05] message specifically where you can tie
[2:08] it back to the Bible like brother brand
[2:10] that message we can tie it back to the
[2:12] Bible so we're tying all these seals
[2:14] back to the Bible now before we get
[2:18] started I want you to realize one thing
[2:21] that there's only Seven Seals now when I
[2:23] went to the Philippines last year they
[2:26] had a doctrine that that uh you know the
[2:30] Bible says seven seals on the back side
[2:33] seal with Seven Seals he they said they
[2:35] 14 seals that brother R revealed seven
[2:37] and that we've got to reveal the other
[2:40] seven no such thing no type it's the
[2:43] same Seven Seals we just haven't
[2:45] understood it cuz I'm going to read you
[2:46] a quote in a few minutes that I think
[2:48] will really help us and get our mind to
[2:50] where we can get back
[2:52] to Revelation it's got to be revealed
[2:57] right okay it's got to be revealed it
[2:59] cannot be just probed that it's got to
[3:01] come straight from God and that
[3:03] Revelation comes straight from God so
[3:06] then we trying to back up a little bit
[3:08] from last Sunday so we took Revelations
[3:10] 5 which is what that's the breaking of
[3:12] the
[3:13] seal the lamb takes the book in his
[3:17] possession now if the lamb takes the
[3:20] book in his possession which is Jesus
[3:22] Christ and then you and I are heirs and
[3:24] Joint Heirs of Jesus Christ we get the
[3:26] same thing he
[3:27] gets right so what was he doing he was
[3:31] at he was he was receiving his body cuz
[3:36] we are the body of Christ the body of
[3:38] Believers you can't you know the head is
[3:40] the most important part of the
[3:43] body but without the
[3:46] body that is no good that's right I mean
[3:49] you can have a head rolling around all
[3:51] over the place full of brains and
[3:52] everything else but if you don't have a
[3:53] body to work through so and you say
[3:57] wellow God's nothing without us he said
[3:59] he was nothing without us I'm just
[4:01] telling you what he
[4:02] said what brother what did the Bible say
[4:05] Paul said without the
[4:07] body you know without the spiritual body
[4:09] you're dead all right and and we can be
[4:12] say wow no I'm alive no you can be the
[4:14] most dead person in the world and be
[4:17] alive that's right all these people that
[4:20] out here athletes and all these people
[4:23] that boy I'm just so alive and
[4:24] everything's they're As Dead As Dead
[4:28] could be without the baptism of the Holy
[4:30] Ghost without Jesus Christ in their life
[4:32] they are walking dead talking about
[4:36] zombies they're walking dead and but
[4:39] what the problem is they don't know it
[4:40] that's right that's the problem that's
[4:42] why I lay out of see it was blind
[4:44] wretched miserable naked and don't know
[4:46] it well how much more are they now blind
[4:50] miserable wretched naked and don't even
[4:54] know it it's like brother R said you see
[4:56] a woman walk down the street with no
[4:57] clothing you say ma'am you don't have
[4:58] any clothing you need to put clothes on
[5:01] what's it to you I've got clothes on
[5:02] well see she's so deceived and what do
[5:04] you think about now same thing with the
[5:06] women stripping their clothes on they
[5:08] don't think nothing about it no more
[5:10] even nominal Christians you know they
[5:11] just walk around with no clothes on so
[5:14] but
[5:15] anyway and I saw when the lamb opened
[5:18] one of the seals now right here is where
[5:20] we're going from Revelations 5
[5:22] Revelations 5 the prophet said was the
[5:24] most Sublime scripture in the Bible Why
[5:28] shows full Redemption
[5:30] when the lamb takes that book that's
[5:32] full Redemption the most important the
[5:35] most important scripture in the Bible is
[5:37] Daniel 9:24 what it positionally places
[5:40] us just like we showed in the Daniel 70
[5:42] weeks it positionally places us where we
[5:45] are and I didn't start this thing so we
[5:47] won have any
[5:49] audio anyway we'll get together sometime
[5:52] but uh come on in come on in hey I knew
[5:55] you were coming before you got
[5:58] here
[6:00] the police told me the police told
[6:03] me good to have you with us that is
[6:06] brother Louis's older sister
[6:10] no can't you tell can't you tell can't
[6:14] you tell her name is Sandra yes that's
[6:17] that's that's his younger sister good to
[6:20] have you with us
[6:24] today okay now and you too CHR thank you
[6:29] thank you for bringing her thank you're
[6:31] welcome okay all right so now we were at
[6:35] Revelations 5 the breaking of the seal
[6:39] that Revelations 5
[6:41] showed full Redemption when the lamb
[6:44] takes that book and it's in his
[6:48] possession now it is his it is his
[6:52] responsibility to break it and not to
[6:56] reveal anything but himself
[7:00] right right I
[7:03] mean that's what I'm saying about what
[7:05] dad's always said what I content you
[7:08] can't reveal the devil in the spiritual
[7:11] Revelation
[7:12] right you can't right you can't reveal
[7:17] the
[7:18] devil as you re as you reveal Jesus
[7:21] Christ you understand what I'm saying a
[7:23] personal relationship once God is
[7:24] revealed to you it's personal
[7:26] relationship Satan can't do
[7:28] that amen amen
[7:31] amen so what what we're dealing with now
[7:33] is is we're dealing with one thing I
[7:35] want to read you the quote before we get
[7:37] on through this let me read you this
[7:39] quote cuz it really helps me cuz look to
[7:43] be real plain and
[7:48] simple the seals have been
[7:53] opened mhm the lamb opened the book and
[7:57] through a prophet of God he delivered
[8:00] that to us in written form
[8:05] mhm you hear what I said yes I said in
[8:08] written
[8:09] form and anyone can read it that's right
[8:13] that's
[8:14] right but if you don't get a
[8:17] revelation the book's closed right I
[8:20] read a quote and I'll read it in a
[8:21] couple weeks I don't want to read it now
[8:23] but I'll I'll tease you with a little
[8:24] bit brother Brown said said Jesus close
[8:26] the book remember even in Luke in Luke 4
[8:30] he revealed who he was and then what did
[8:31] he do the Bible said he shut the book up
[8:33] and handed it back to the priest well he
[8:34] shut the book up and it's only to be
[8:36] open in the end time but it's not
[8:38] supposed it's not it's not that God
[8:40] closed the Bible and then he's going to
[8:42] open this book over here no the Bible by
[8:45] the Bible become a brand new book to the
[8:47] prophet watch this quote right
[8:51] here take a moment on my slow
[8:56] iPad my slow iPad
[8:59] all right let's go to where I was
[9:01] looking at
[9:02] today this
[9:04] morning now brother briam is preaching
[9:06] on is this the sign of the end everybody
[9:08] see that yeah MH all right now the
[9:11] mystery here is the mystery a mystery is
[9:15] scripture is a previously hidden truth
[9:19] now divinely revealed everybody got that
[9:22] divinely reveal but which is a
[9:25] supernatural element Still Remains
[9:28] despite the
[9:31] Revelation you say how in the world can
[9:33] that
[9:33] happen listen when I was 14 years old
[9:37] not bragging but when I was 14 years old
[9:40] I read the prophet's message I knew
[9:42] there was only one God and that Jesus
[9:45] was his name I knew there was no eternal
[9:48] hell I could see it in the Bible but I
[9:49] was as lost as a as a as a blind man I
[9:52] was lost I wasn't born again I was lost
[9:55] but I could understand by natural
[9:58] understanding I could understand what
[10:00] brother Randon was talking about that's
[10:01] why the Bible says that the most
[10:02] illiterate person can be able to
[10:04] understand that M right and I had no but
[10:07] see but now watch you say well the water
[10:10] baptism been revealed to me most like
[10:12] brother Dale says he said if one God is
[10:14] revealed to you then you have to be
[10:16] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:18] Christ right people say oh I know what
[10:20] one there only one God but I'm going to
[10:22] keep my father son Holy Ghost B no yet
[10:24] this hadn't really been revealed what
[10:26] happened there's a supernatural element
[10:28] that hadn't been revealed to you yet mhm
[10:30] there's something that hadn't been made
[10:31] known to you now you reason I'm reading
[10:35] this let me read it one more time the
[10:37] Mysteries here is the mystery now he's
[10:39] he's going to Revelations
[10:41] 10:7 cuz there's only one mystery right
[10:44] the Mysteries here is the mystery a
[10:47] mystery is scripture go right
[10:50] here he talk Jesus told him said right
[10:53] here because it's given to you because
[10:56] it's given to you to know the mysteries
[10:57] of the kingdom of heaven but not not to
[10:59] them but to them it is not given the
[11:02] mystery now watch what he says here is
[11:04] the mystery he breaks it down to the
[11:06] mystery the mystery is
[11:08] scripture so every mystery is to be
[11:12] revealed according to scripture MH Eat
[11:16] My Flesh and drink my blood that's
[11:18] written down on a piece of paper that's
[11:20] the Eternal Word of God now you take a
[11:23] slant on that
[11:25] and we got to find the body of Jesus and
[11:28] start eating it and we got to
[11:29] find the blood and start drinking it or
[11:31] we're not in the
[11:33] Bible if that's your
[11:36] Revelation but there's a mystery behind
[11:38] that
[11:39] revelation of taking of the
[11:42] communion that Paul came and instituted
[11:45] later and showing what there was a
[11:48] divinely revealed truth of that
[11:51] scripture Eat My Flesh and drink my
[11:53] blood cuz remember when we get into
[11:55] Matthew 24:24 or Matthew 24 and we start
[11:59] looking at the seals you're going to
[12:02] wonder well that happened so many years
[12:05] ago
[12:07] remember this is this is what I
[12:10] see God gives somebody a vision they
[12:13] write it down like John he gave John a
[12:17] vision of all that in Revelations right
[12:19] all this we're going to read well John
[12:21] writes it down now he sees it in a
[12:24] vision a television he sees it in a
[12:28] vision m
[12:29] M cuz remember I want you to understand
[12:32] something John was commissioned to write
[12:34] what he saw that's right right you know
[12:38] so he saw something it wasn't just a
[12:40] figment of his imagination right this
[12:43] comes straight from the mind of God that
[12:45] had already happened in the mind of God
[12:48] everybody all right with that you got to
[12:50] go with me here you got to go way back
[12:52] way back and find where this Revelation
[12:54] come from that's right Revelation come
[12:56] right straight from God John you just
[12:59] write it on a piece of paper and send it
[13:01] to the churches so John writes what he
[13:04] saw mystery biing mystery you've seen
[13:07] many mysteries in Revelation John no
[13:10] doubt when he come back from patmas
[13:12] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost he
[13:13] probably understood some of those things
[13:15] but some of those things were sealed up
[13:16] just like they were for Daniel they were
[13:18] sealed up until the end but now remember
[13:22] John writes
[13:24] it and then it doesn't start coming to
[13:28] pass till
[13:29] you know some of it till 1500 years
[13:31] later some of it till now 2,000 years
[13:33] later John wrote it in the ad6 ad90 so
[13:37] you know we're almost at 2,000
[13:39] years before it actually
[13:44] happened so let's bring it over here to
[13:47] where the two prophets we just covered D
[13:49] in 70 weeks the two prophets the two
[13:51] witnesses John saw those two witnesses
[13:54] wrote it down now it's going to be
[13:57] almost 2,000 years before they come on
[13:59] the scene but you and I are not going to
[14:01] even be here to see that that's right
[14:03] you see what I'm talking about there's
[14:04] layer upon layer of things but now you
[14:07] and I get the divinely revealed
[14:11] Supernatural element of those two
[14:14] witnesses We Know by
[14:17] Revelation that they're Moses and Eli
[14:20] the spirit of Moses and Elijah on two
[14:21] men they got to be Jews and the Bible
[14:25] obviously tells us they got 1260 days to
[14:27] do their job
[14:29] right and that it will be the basis of
[14:32] this
[14:33] message this Revelation is what goes to
[14:35] them so there's a divinely revealed
[14:38] truth that has a supernatural element
[14:40] that is going to naturally
[14:43] happen right but we see it
[14:47] supernaturally we back up and look at it
[14:49] and we say hey that's what's going to
[14:51] happen I was thinking the other day I
[14:53] thought you
[14:55] know Martin Luther I doubt this is my
[15:00] this is I'm going out on a limb here
[15:02] Martin Luther never in his life sat down
[15:06] and I don't believe God revealed to him
[15:08] that he was the fifth Church a
[15:17] messenger it took brother brandom to
[15:19] know who them seven Messengers
[15:22] were I'm sure Paul you know he was kind
[15:26] of on the foundation so he said
[15:27] everything's going to be based on me I'm
[15:29] sure that God told him said look Paul
[15:31] everything's going to be based because
[15:32] Paul said you'll be judged by my gospel
[15:34] if a man come from heaven and bring any
[15:36] other thing well see nobody else has
[15:38] come through in a commentary in
[15:40] scripture except Paul see irenius is not
[15:43] in the Bible that's right
[15:45] right there was no Bible when irus was
[15:48] here
[15:50] right there was no Bible when Martin was
[15:53] here what you hear what I'm saying you
[15:56] got to imagine that one day that that
[15:58] just take all our Bibles away all we
[16:01] have to go by on is what somebody else
[16:03] said there was no television there was
[16:06] no they couldn't text each other and say
[16:08] how y'all
[16:10] doing no irenius stood out on the word
[16:14] of God that he
[16:16] heard right now who gets the
[16:19] supernatural element of that though we
[16:22] do we get the Supernatural part that he
[16:25] naturally saw he was on Earth I don't
[16:28] believe Iranian stood up one day and
[16:29] said I'm the second Church age messenger
[16:31] no but he had a message from God he
[16:34] delivered that message and like brother
[16:36] Dale said and many I want you to see
[16:38] just see this but I took and got all the
[16:41] U all the deaths of the of the church
[16:44] age messenger but now remember if the
[16:47] messenger comes at the end of the
[16:49] age he can't go too far into his age
[16:52] because he cometh the end of the
[16:54] previous age right right and you're
[16:56] going to see that this will help you
[16:57] with the seals because they all overlap
[16:59] and tie together there's a supernatural
[17:01] element in these seals that's what I'm
[17:02] trying to get to Revelation 61 was a
[17:06] scene in heaven right that scene come to
[17:09] a man named William brandham and he
[17:11] opened and and cracked open that
[17:14] seal all right but there's a
[17:16] supernatural element behind
[17:19] that right because see Clarence Lin and
[17:23] some of those other oldtimers they
[17:25] brought the the Holy Ghost was not the
[17:29] white horse
[17:30] rider they said he knew it was the
[17:32] Antichrist mhm but he didn't have a
[17:35] message behind it right there wasn't a
[17:37] fully revealed message there was Loose
[17:40] Ends remember me preaching on that not
[17:42] there was loose ends that that that even
[17:45] even the old other Church age Messengers
[17:47] had except Paul in the first few but now
[17:50] Martin Luther strict trinitarian you
[17:52] couldn't sit down and talk to him about
[17:54] Jesus Christ baptism you could now but
[17:57] you can't couldn't be in cuz it wasn't
[17:59] revealed to it but Paul the the the
[18:02] messenger comes at the end of the AG so
[18:04] at the end of
[18:05] Pentecost 53 ad is when it started 170
[18:08] is when it ended Paul died in 67
[18:12] ad so he died at the end of the
[18:14] Pentecostal Church age right or
[18:16] Pentecostal age all right irenius the
[18:20] message started at in 170 to 312 he died
[18:24] in 202 he lived 30 years if you'll
[18:27] notice and I'm not to go through all of
[18:28] them you can look them up yourself
[18:29] Google
[18:32] [Music]
[18:33] it or
[18:35] Wikipedia but
[18:37] watch all these Messengers come at the
[18:40] end of the age as they matured out of
[18:43] one age into
[18:45] another except for Columba now I don't
[18:48] understand but Columba
[18:51] died
[18:53] six he died nine years before the church
[18:56] age started but his influence right
[18:58] coming out of this age of Martin to
[19:00] Columba his influence began in Martin's
[19:04] Church age Paul's influence began in the
[19:07] Pentecostal Church age or the
[19:09] Pentecostal age we don't call it a
[19:11] church age but the Pentecostal age
[19:13] Paul's influence I was reading and if
[19:15] you look in the book of Acts Paul began
[19:18] about ad 3435 few years after Jesus died
[19:21] he began to start his ministry well well
[19:24] he died in ' 67 the church age started
[19:26] in 53 ad so you see what I'm saying see
[19:29] where that overlap comes in Paul comes
[19:31] at the end of the age all the messengers
[19:33] come at the End of the Age they feel
[19:35] what's going on in that
[19:37] age they grew up in that age is what I'm
[19:40] talking about that naturally that's
[19:42] going to do spiritually naturally they
[19:44] grew up they were born in the church age
[19:46] previous they grew up and right if
[19:48] you'll notice every one of
[19:50] these even brother brand there was about
[19:52] 40 years that they
[19:54] overlap well that's the 40 Years of of
[19:58] our life and and most of them died in
[19:59] their 70s and 80s so they were mature
[20:02] 40y old men when they began to bring
[20:04] their message right their message only
[20:07] went about 40 years they died but now
[20:09] the ministry of
[20:11] those that's my point now the ministry
[20:14] of William brandom didn't stop in' 65
[20:16] when he died it continues
[20:18] on right and it's on now you see what
[20:21] I'm saying that's what happened back
[20:23] here that's why I see that's not a
[20:24] mystery anymore right it's not a mystery
[20:26] how that a messenger can come at the End
[20:28] of the Age bring his message go off the
[20:31] scene and then a bunch of people pick it
[20:34] up and carry that characteristic of that
[20:37] church age carried on until somebody
[20:39] like Luther he died in
[20:42] 1566 the start his church AE started
[20:45] 1520 so he had 46 years to preach his
[20:50] message get people to believe it and see
[20:53] it and then God took him off the scene
[20:55] and he went on and carried on same
[20:57] things happened in now brother Brandon
[20:59] brought the message brought us a
[21:01] divinely revealed
[21:04] truth but now there's a supernatural
[21:07] element on top of that that we have to
[21:10] get you don't
[21:13] [Music]
[21:16] listen the years that they were
[21:19] born you'll get it I mean really if
[21:21] you'll understand it is a real it it'll
[21:23] help you to understand how God
[21:26] works cuz God never changes his pattern
[21:29] his pattern continues on it's the
[21:32] message that does the word not the
[21:34] that's correct the word that bring the
[21:36] man has to be off the scene before the
[21:38] message can take effect you say oh no
[21:41] Jesus's message was not effective at all
[21:45] except for the healings and the things
[21:47] I'm talking about his message the
[21:49] revelation of who he
[21:51] was was not revealed until he died and
[21:55] went off the S that's right amen amen
[21:58] God himself so if that's the pattern
[22:00] then that's the pattern we got to go by
[22:02] that's why I said brother Rand might
[22:03] could have took a Rapture just today one
[22:06] problem us that's
[22:09] right we were not
[22:11] there some of y'all weren't even born in
[22:15] 1965 most of you were not born in
[22:18] 1965 how many of you were born after
[22:26] 1965
[22:29] half of you so you're the reason he had
[22:31] to go off the sink no we are really I
[22:33] mean it had to be a p but still saying
[22:35] it had to be a
[22:37] pattern God couldn't do one more for one
[22:39] than he did for another so he took the
[22:41] pattern brought the message brought the
[22:43] messenger at the end of the Pentecostal
[22:45] age and even right here you'll read on
[22:47] down where all these Mysteries I'm not
[22:48] going to read them but you know the
[22:49] Bible lists these like 12 mysteries in
[22:52] the Bible all right and he list them all
[22:54] here and is this the sign of the end sir
[22:57] now remember
[22:59] one that message preached it was
[23:00] preached in December the 30th 1962 well
[23:03] the seals what brother Ram's doing now
[23:05] he's leaving them and go into Arizona to
[23:07] get the revelation of the seals and
[23:08] March and come back and start preaching
[23:10] so he's he's two months away he knows
[23:13] something's coming cuz he's a prophet
[23:15] but he keeps telling them he keeps
[23:17] telling
[23:18] them you right
[23:20] here that's some of the Mysteries that
[23:23] this Angel he's talking about the
[23:24] seventh angel coming supposed to wind up
[23:26] all the Mysteries may I say this with
[23:28] reverence but referring to the angel of
[23:30] God serpent
[23:32] seed now see the serpent seed if you'll
[23:36] just sit down and and take common sense
[23:39] right and know that an apple could not
[23:42] have caused a fall of
[23:46] mankind okay and then now that pattern
[23:50] has to continue down but listen there's
[23:52] more to serpent seed than just that
[23:54] there was sex in the
[23:56] garden I mean we're all adults here
[23:59] we're having still having T I mean you
[24:01] understand what I'm saying it didn't do
[24:02] away with anything that's right and it
[24:04] didn't explode anything it was the
[24:07] program God had so the serpent SE now we
[24:09] realize that yes it was a natural act
[24:12] but what happened brother Brandon backs
[24:14] us up and said eve had to put it in her
[24:16] mind
[24:18] first right right cuz you get a
[24:21] revelation and you go you get you get
[24:23] that you know you see that it was a
[24:25] relationship between Eve and the Beast
[24:27] which was was the missing link that
[24:28] everybody's looking for that God did
[24:31] away with that but you look and you go
[24:32] back and and brother R takes us all the
[24:34] way back to not just the natural act he
[24:36] takes us back to where Eve gets a
[24:38] revelation her
[24:40] own Revelation and that's what caused it
[24:44] right not that this caused it this was
[24:48] just an
[24:49] effect
[24:51] right James covers it real well I may go
[24:55] back and and preach that again cuz I
[24:56] enjoyed it where lust is conceived it
[24:58] brings forth sin when sin's finished it
[25:01] brings forth death you say well lust is
[25:04] bad lust is bad but if you cut it off
[25:06] before it continues on but if you don't
[25:08] when lust is
[25:10] conceived it brings forth sin the
[25:12] product right and when that product is
[25:16] finished it brings forth death so those
[25:19] four things you got your four horse
[25:20] riders you got your four um combat Beast
[25:23] you got your four Lineo man an eagle
[25:25] that brings everything back so you see
[25:27] that four is not a bad number when you
[25:28] use it in the right way then he talks
[25:31] about an eternal burning hell you'll
[25:33] burn for millions of years but anything
[25:35] that was eternal that's common sense you
[25:37] just have to look at somebody say look
[25:39] Jesus God's the only one that has
[25:41] eternal life right if you're going to
[25:45] burn in an eternal hell God's going to
[25:46] have to be down there with
[25:48] you that's to me that you just look at
[25:50] that and you go man how do people you
[25:52] know what it's old tradition right old
[25:54] tradition that oh you're going to burn
[25:56] in hell eternally that's right right now
[25:58] there is an eternal separation yes cuz
[26:01] once you get separated from God and you
[26:03] don't reconcile and come back then
[26:05] you're eternally separated there's no
[26:06] way for you to come back and that's for
[26:09] an eternity cuz it's it's done right but
[26:12] you're not going to live for an eternity
[26:14] and and and burnning hell you it's going
[26:16] to be you're just going to go away
[26:18] that's right all right now watch this
[26:21] right here the mystery of the baptism of
[26:22] the Holy Ghost without
[26:24] sensation but the person of Christ
[26:26] performing in you the same works that he
[26:29] did got it the mystery of baptism of the
[26:32] Holy Ghost without sensation he's
[26:34] talking to Pentecostal people he's
[26:36] telling them that the
[26:38] Revelation is right there without a
[26:42] sensation that's right the mystery of
[26:45] water
[26:48] [Music]
[26:51] baptism let me there was one down here
[26:53] oh now watch right here let's get to
[26:55] this cuz this is what this is what
[26:58] happens when a messenger brings a
[27:01] message the sounding of the trumpet
[27:03] means a gospel trumpet and the sounding
[27:06] of a trumpet in the Bible means get
[27:07] ready for scriptural War are you getting
[27:10] it down scriptural
[27:12] War Paul said you going put it down 1
[27:15] Corinthians if the trumpet give an
[27:16] uncertain sound how will a man know what
[27:18] to prepare for if it doesn't have a
[27:20] scriptural sound a Vindicated the
[27:22] Vindication of the word of God made
[27:23] manifest how will we know we're at the
[27:25] end
[27:26] time
[27:28] all right then it keep coming on
[27:35] down pay attention to
[27:38] that right here notice each Church age
[27:41] had its messenger we know that Paul was
[27:42] the first messenger and when the first
[27:44] trumpet sounded and the first seal was
[27:46] torn
[27:48] loose cuz the seals kind of go with the
[27:51] with the church anges all right I said
[27:53] kind of you can't they parallel they
[27:55] don't exact match everybody got that M
[27:59] cuz if the Rapture takes place on the
[28:00] force field you don't have the bride
[28:02] here in 5 six and seven so you
[28:04] understand what I'm saying all right
[28:05] Paul was the first Messenger as we found
[28:07] and what did he do declared war on
[28:09] what the old Pentecostal Orthodox church
[28:12] church behind right we not believing the
[28:15] Messianic sign that Jesus had produced
[28:17] to them while they should have not
[28:19] it remember Paul come at the End of the
[28:22] Age all the messengers come at the end
[28:24] of the age is at the end time when these
[28:26] things are brought forth what it's in
[28:28] the end time of the previous
[28:31] message okay they had lap overs but we
[28:35] don't have lap overs right we're going
[28:38] up right now God's going to laugh it
[28:40] over to the three and A2 years to the
[28:42] Jews but we're going to come back in a
[28:44] millennium and we're going to carry this
[28:45] thing all all the way through Paul
[28:47] knowing the scriptures know Jesus was
[28:49] the Messiah he blasted those synagogues
[28:50] from place to place with the scripture
[28:52] and was put out of every one of them now
[28:54] what's he doing he's telling them about
[28:56] himself
[29:00] he's telling about himself right Paul's
[29:03] bringing a message calls a scriptural a
[29:05] war brother Bram brings a message first
[29:08] part of his message was healing signs
[29:10] and wonders 50,000 100,000 200,000
[29:13] people and then when he really began to
[29:17] with the scripture he was put out of
[29:19] every one of them brother B standing in
[29:21] 1962 he went to Arizona and nobody's
[29:24] invited him to preach and it gets worse
[29:27] as the seals opens it just gets worse
[29:29] and worse and worse right till finally
[29:32] he shook the dust off his feet turned to
[29:33] the Gentiles what was it sounding of a
[29:35] trumpet an angel messenger standing
[29:38] there with the word oh my don't you miss
[29:40] that now the word and Paul with the
[29:41] unadulterated interpretation of God's
[29:43] word blasted every one of them
[29:45] synagogues cost him his
[29:47] life how we could go down to irenius the
[29:50] one the messenger of the next Church AG
[29:51] St Martin began to get the doctrine of
[29:54] nians and they blasted that AG St Martin
[29:56] Luther he jumps over to Luther the fifth
[29:59] messenger he blasted the Catholic church
[30:00] with the word of God the just shall live
[30:02] by faith this is not the literal Body of
[30:04] Christ and he throw the communion on the
[30:06] floor and walked out and blasted the
[30:07] Catholic church that trumpet sounded
[30:10] right John Wesley raised up days of the
[30:11] angan church well there's no more reason
[30:13] to have revivals and it went to see but
[30:15] John Wesley stood up with the message of
[30:17] the second work of Grace and he blasted
[30:19] the anglian church with the gospel
[30:21] trumpet prepared for war that's right he
[30:23] did it now watch this now we're in the
[30:26] loud C and AG when they again
[30:28] denominated method Baptist prian Luther
[30:30] and Pentecostal and were looking for a
[30:32] prophet to come to blast this age and
[30:33] turn them back from their
[30:35] iniquity now if that's been the
[30:39] trend pattern yeah all the way down
[30:42] Through the Ages will God change his
[30:44] Trend in this day congregation says no
[30:46] he can't change it he has to keep the
[30:47] regular stride and remember this
[30:49] messenger was the seventh angel and he
[30:51] was to take all the Mysteries and gather
[30:53] them together notice the seventh angel
[30:55] was to blast the loud see it
[30:59] this what Brother D been talking about
[31:00] he hadn't used this scripture but he
[31:02] blast the L out of sins what he's
[31:04] blasting the
[31:05] Pentecost all right Rich Church rich
[31:08] increas with Goods have need of nothing
[31:10] he said you're miserable reged poor
[31:11] blind naked don't know it that was his
[31:13] message oh God send us to Fearless
[31:16] Prophet when thus sayith the Lord that
[31:17] the Vindicated word will move through
[31:18] and prove that he sent from God and when
[31:20] he comes he'll blast them ages sure will
[31:23] he'll set that Ley and church against
[31:26] him they were already starting to be
[31:28] against right all
[31:30] right now notice the L chch the
[31:33] Messenger will finish of the layout of
[31:35] sins the seventh angel will finish all
[31:37] the Mysteries that's been lost in the
[31:39] battles before for the truth so you see
[31:42] what's coming
[31:44] to look right here then comes the church
[31:47] age with the baptism of the spirit he's
[31:49] talking about Pentecost not what brother
[31:50] ding about but they messed it up and
[31:52] went right back into formalism like they
[31:54] did the first time all right right
[31:58] then he keep talking about the
[32:04] candlesticks L of sins came BR right the
[32:06] same mess it did in the first place
[32:08] don't you see what I mean there was a
[32:10] lot of truth lost but this seventh angel
[32:12] don't compromise on nothing he gathers
[32:14] up all the Loose Ends gathers them all
[32:16] up and at his sounding all the mystery
[32:18] he went back to one all the mystery of
[32:21] God should be finished all right oh God
[32:23] send him we know he was standing there
[32:27] but remember no one was getting this
[32:31] message that really carried it on to the
[32:33] coming of the Lord right now today 50
[32:36] years later there was sure there was
[32:39] people that got a revelation do you hear
[32:40] what I'm saying there's people that got
[32:42] a revelation they came out like brother
[32:44] Joe Green's father they asked brother
[32:47] Joe Green's father they said brother
[32:49] Henry why did Brother brandham come to a
[32:51] little old town called spendel North
[32:53] Carolina to hold a series of meetings
[32:56] and brother Henry said to get
[32:59] me to get me cuz it brought the message
[33:02] to Northern of Western North Carolina
[33:04] through brother Joe Green's father
[33:06] brother Henry green well brother Henry
[33:08] green wasn't really a sponsor of the
[33:09] meeting but he was after the meeting
[33:12] well then brother rown goes off the
[33:14] scene well who carries his message
[33:17] brother Henry
[33:18] green brother Carol some of the old old
[33:21] ones that were back in you know you
[33:23] don't know who was sitting in the
[33:24] congregation of all those messages he
[33:26] preached and somebody caught one or two
[33:28] Revelations right all right but now
[33:32] listen that carried them to their
[33:36] death natural not spiritually they were
[33:38] spiritually they were alive for the
[33:40] message they had but they're naturally
[33:42] they naturally gone on brother Henry
[33:44] some of the ones Henry green and some of
[33:46] the older ones the old Fighters that
[33:48] come out of Pentecost and really did get
[33:50] a a revelation of the message but they
[33:53] didn't get the supernatural
[33:55] element
[33:57] they got part of the mystery they didn't
[34:00] get all of it you and I when we start
[34:03] into these the this is supposed to be
[34:04] the ending up the culmination the
[34:07] supernatural element of everything that
[34:09] God said from the foundation of the
[34:11] world to today that's why brother R said
[34:13] he never worked in a more spiritual
[34:16] Supernatural realm than the seals
[34:19] open he come out and preach one seal go
[34:22] back home get the second one come back
[34:23] out and preach I mean you know seven
[34:26] days yeah eight
[34:28] sermons um Counting the questions and
[34:31] answers then going back further to
[34:34] the to the breach but you see what I'm
[34:37] talking about if these are hidden
[34:38] mysteries the man will have to be a
[34:40] prophet
[34:42] yes because the word only comes to a
[34:45] prophet all right so the prophet but the
[34:48] prophet brings the message
[34:51] right brother brandham said that the
[34:54] that the people in Israel they became at
[34:56] ease that's what we've been talking
[34:57] about you know locally us been talking
[34:59] about the squeeze and things like
[35:02] that Moses the messenger walks on the
[35:05] scene and stirs up pharaoh and says Let
[35:07] My People Go I reading it yesterday
[35:10] Pharaoh turns right around and says go
[35:13] back down there and tell them we're not
[35:15] even giving them any straw anymore and
[35:17] they've got to double produce what they
[35:19] produced
[35:20] before right
[35:23] persecution then they cried for a
[35:25] deliverer well the deliverer was was
[35:27] already in their
[35:28] midst right but now remember Moses
[35:31] didn't carry them over who was the
[35:33] deliverer in the midst the Holy Ghost
[35:36] Jesus Christ in spirit form in the Holy
[35:38] the form of the Holy Ghost was in Moses
[35:41] but he had to get into the people yes
[35:44] right we don't know we know it wasn't an
[35:46] indwelling but there had to be an
[35:48] anointing that look we're tired of
[35:50] this we need a deliverer to not only
[35:53] take us out brother randam took us out
[35:55] come out of here my people brother took
[35:57] us out of the denominational world but
[36:00] Joshua is the one that put us in the
[36:01] promised land right right amen which was
[36:05] what a type of the baptism of the Holy
[36:07] Ghost in all the
[36:08] Believers right you say how can it
[36:11] happen well John brother said John typed
[36:13] the entire bride he typed several
[36:15] million people with different
[36:17] characteristics in each Church age John
[36:19] typed that whole bride so God can type
[36:23] any way he wants to one person for a
[36:25] billion or a billion people for one
[36:27] that's right either way he wants to so
[36:29] what's he doing now to me I think he's
[36:32] bringing now the supernatural element
[36:34] yes that's been hidden for 50
[36:38] years okay and I believe that people are
[36:41] beginning to catch on and and this
[36:43] thing's going to start coming more to a
[36:45] narrow to narrow narrow narrow okay so
[36:47] that's what we're going to talk about
[36:49] next next week we'll talk about the
[36:51] first seal what is the first seal we
[36:53] know it's a white horn Rider went out
[36:56] and that brother brandom showed that
[36:58] that was the Antichrist but there was
[37:00] something there's a supernatural element
[37:02] that goes with
[37:04] that cuz you can read it listen go read
[37:08] your first deal next Sun next week he
[37:11] tells you what the Antichrist is it's
[37:13] the white horse rider and he had a bow
[37:15] with no arrows he's giving you what the
[37:18] characteristic of who that person
[37:20] is but you got to remember one thing if
[37:22] he went
[37:24] out God's already went out with the
[37:27] message Satan is only topping back
[37:30] behind that's right so really honestly
[37:32] let me let me be honest with you let me
[37:34] be honest were you going to lie was it
[37:37] going to lie I me be honest with you
[37:39] there was a white horse rider wrote out
[37:41] in the first
[37:43] church and it was the Holy
[37:47] Ghost hello it was the Holy Ghost in the
[37:50] Believers the pure word was in Paul and
[37:53] that white horse rider went out but what
[37:55] do we see we see the opposition and
[37:58] that's what we've got to see is the
[38:01] opposition this way I see he's been hid
[38:05] behind God all
[38:07] along now what do you do God's riding
[38:10] off and then Satan I mean Jesus God
[38:13] brings a message and then God comes I
[38:15] God brings a message I'm he I'm singing
[38:16] the song and then Satan comes right
[38:18] behind it and perverts it just as soon
[38:20] as he brings a message say pervers it
[38:22] you got to remember that every time you
[38:24] have a revelation remember make sure
[38:26] from God make sure it TPS every
[38:30] scripture hurry up we got to go what
[38:32] does it mean the back side of the book
[38:35] we'll get into that later then not right
[38:37] now okay we got to go got to go got to
[38:41] go
