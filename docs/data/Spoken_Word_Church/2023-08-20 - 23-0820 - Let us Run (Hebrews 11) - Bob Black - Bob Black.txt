========================================

God bless you Saints amen good to be in the house of the Lord it's brother Aaron taking this morning changed things up a little bit this morning let's go the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord and I pray Lord that you'll just bless our study as we study these things out the things that are said Lord that will be edifying to your people Lord help us to understand Lord and place ourselves into scripture granted Lord that you'll just be with brother Aaron and this morning and myself for this afternoon that you'll bless the services today Lord and be with us Lord we ask in your name amen now um all right you know we're closing in on uh there's only I think 13 chapters in Hebrews or almost to the end um I'm uh just praying and trying to seek the Lord's guidance on which way to go next I'm thinking about um maybe doing a little study on the church ages um or the book of Romans but if anybody has any suggestions let me know if you want something like a deep study on something that's just been laying on your heart let me know and we'll we'll consider that Hebrews 11 39 and 40 were just kind of wrapping up Hebrews 11 it says these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect and we were talking about what Perfection Perfection comes from Christ he's the one that's perfected so what's happening as you as you receive the word you become the word you take on his life and his characteristics and you are actually becoming um God manifested in Tabernacle in flesh and so that's the process of perfection that as you perceive the word you are you are being built into the stature of a perfect man and that completes your profession and so those that are in the ground are waiting on us to come to that place so that we will pull them out of the ground like a magnet as they as they uh the word comes to the word and then um you read in Revelation chapter four where the that last trumpet sounds and uh John heard a voice calling come up and said we are pulled up by that same word that we've heard we've become the word and it pulls the dead Saints out of the ground and we hear the word and it pulls us up in a Rapture and so it all hinges on us yielding ourselves and and uh becoming fervent and as we see in Hebrews chapter 12 when we get into that Paul just all through the book of Hebrews encourages us to not don't give up you're running a race don't give up and what is our race for the finish line is perfection the Finish Line you're you're racing you're uh going through this this process of cleansing of the process of of the the virtues being birthed into you being manifested in your life and and and until you're racing it's a it's an endurance contest to not give up and you and you know you see we see so many that kind of drop off and give up and that's what Paul is trying to get impress on us in in Hebrews chapter 12 don't give up don't just keep keep going keep moving and the statue of a perfect man brother Brown would say he said you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection excuse me and they're under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to us Perfection that when Christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller in the minority now you think about that it shouldn't shouldn't surprise us with all the messages brother Brown preached about wanted a million and how Enoch really types the Rapture church and and there was eight went over on the r but one that took a Rapture and so forth it's coming down you oh you can see all around people dropping away and people leaving and things because they're just they can't they're not running the race well like Paul said but it shouldn't be a surprise to us because Paul and brother Branham told us these things Paul the Bible says there's going to be a great Falling Away and he said it would come look what he said it's a whole lot sharper than that but just like to write that across there see a whole lot sharper than what you and I would think it's come to a needlepoint a needlepoint now now that's just not in people but that's also in doctrine that your Doctrine is going to become so razor home down where you know what you believe in you know what you're talking about you know whether how to be baptized and how to be born again and how to grow and what the son of man is and all these things keep build up building up precept upon precepted let's hone down hone down to Precision until the church and the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of a Ministry that this left because when this headstone comes back the same kind of what same kind of Life same kind of person same kind of deity and you and I God manifesting us the same way that he was manifested as he walked the shores of Galilee God In the Flesh back again so Paul in Hebrews chapter 12 says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now I've got this picture what Paul is trying to impress upon us that we've got all these people in Hebrews chapter 11 that are cheering us on and I've got a runner here that's running and he's getting like in a marathon and he's got he's he's clapping the hands of people or if you could look over the just see the ones in Hebrews 11 looking over the banistry of Heaven at us what oh they're cheering us on because they know that without us they can't be made perfect so we've got all these examples that we can look to of people that that ran the race well by looking not at their circumstances but looking straight to what God promised and so that's how you that's how you run this race ignoring all the people that have preached false Doctrine ignoring all the people that ain't living the life ignoring all the people that say things bad about you ignore it and just look straight to Christ and that's how you win let us run with patience the race that is set before us patiently you know you come to church it's Wednesday like brother Louise has preached on it's the mundane you know just you're just going through your actions of a Christian just Sunday and Wednesday Sunday and Wednesday with patience because you're running a race and and things are happening when you come to church maybe it doesn't seem like it but you're you're slowly and steadily being changed know you're not in First Corinthians 9 24 4 says Paul's talk he loves to talk about this race know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain in other words he's saying don't run haphazardly and like well I guess I guess I'm here I guess now that I'm in church it'd be a good time to take a little snooze and I hadn't had a good nap all week so now that I'm in church it's time to just rest a little bit but run like you're going to you're like you're you're involved run like you're engaged run because you you know what you're running for when we come to church we know what we're doing here we're running to for for Perfection there's a there's a reason why we're here and Paul and and so he said wherefore seeing we also are compassionate about what's so great cloud of witnesses what to say it aside every weight and the sandwich does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the racing has set before us so we're running and in First Corinthians again know ye not that they was running a race run all but one received the prize so run that you may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an Incorruptible somebody that's just running a normal race is running to just obtain a crown that you could you it might be a plastic crown that you could throw in the crack trash and it just it'll rot in the landfill but we're Racing for a crown that will never pass away I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight eye like a boxer so far not as one that beat at the air I'm not just swinging at the air and not doing nothing the series impressing on us that we know what we're doing we have there's a purpose to these things but I keep under my body and bring it under subjection into subjection unless that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway but what he's trying to say let's not run the race and then halfway through the race you're something that everybody else passes along and they they look you know in life there are shipwrecks along the way where you can look at as a lesson to yourself to say well I don't do that and so you he's saying I don't want to be one of those examples that other people can look at like that a shipwreck where you can say well don't go to those rocks over there don't do like that preacher did right there that I myself should be a Castaway but so how are you going to avoid those things Paul tells tells us in verse 2 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that will set before him endure the cross he's talking about the race now he endured the endured all these hard sufferings and things despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be weird and faint in your minds contradiction of Sinners why why would a sinner put put the sinless one on the cross why would they treat him that way that's a contradiction lest ye be weird and faint in your minds ye have not yet resisted under blood striving against sin he's telling everybody you haven't you haven't done like Jesus did you haven't walked that Via De La Rosa with with all your that your back beating up and your your kidneys showing and you hadn't got to a place like that so you're you say well boy it sure is hard coming to church and people maybe say things that I don't like and preach maybe I get pre-stone every now and then can you not endure you haven't come to a place where you're walking like Jesus did yeah you if you don't have blood dripping into your eyes and maybe maybe one of your eyes has gone blind or something because the thorn is sticking into it you hadn't come to it that's what Paul's saying don't be weary don't faint when you get to a place where you think like it's real tough and everything and and because he's saying endure what is endurance the fact or power of enduring and unpleasant or difficult process or situation without giving away ha oh you know you know the Bible even says if you put your hand in the plow and turn back you're not even worthy of the Kingdom to give up to give up that's what Paul was stressing if you give up if you if you come to church a little bit come to church and it's preached you get preached on maybe a little bit and things you know it's if sometimes you feel like you're getting priest on the the antidote for that the fix for that is keep growing a little bit until you don't feel that you're getting preached on that's what this is right here if you if you don't have these things that are on the board back here that just keep growing and then then you'll come to a place like brother Adam said until you don't feel like you're getting pre-stone anymore so when you get when you feel like you're getting something you know you just feel like your spirit's vibrating or something something's out of kilter when the word's going forth oh you got to have enduring power you got don't give up don't give up and just go home and say well I I don't like I don't like the way they talk to me or whatever you just keep keep running a race like this person that I've got a picture of here going up the mountain you got to keep going you got to keep moving don't stop the endurance is the ability to withstand the hardship or adversity now talking about shipwrecks along the way you you and I both know we we can look around and see people that have given up well I'm just going to stay home and just I'm going to listen to tapes because I can't endure that's not what God wants you to do he don't want you to separate yourself and be isolated just you just keep running the race keep pressing on Paul would say in verse 5 and ye have forgot I know this is a little bit small so y'all just I'll just read it I'll just listen ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chasing of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth and if ye endure chastening God dieth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chastes nothing not but if ye be without chastisement whereof all our partakers then are ye bastards and not Sons so that's how you know that's how you know that God cares about you is he'll put somebody behind the pulpit to correct you he'll give you people relationships in your life where people will say what you don't need to be doing that don't put your money in that do this or whatever but you got people in your life that'll tell you how how to live and how to do and that's how you know that God loves you is because he's trying to straighten you up that's that's why oh people get so bent out of shape about preachers preaching on coming to church but it's for your good because we're running a race for Perfection and how you going to get perfected outside of the word how you going to get perfected if you're not under subjection to the word if you can't and you're chastening then what does what does he say there in verse 8. if he can't endure if you can't endure chastening then you the the the calls is because you don't know who your daddy is oh see well that's why you got to be born again when you're born again then you know who your daddy is and then you can take Chad kazak because you know why it's coming you know the reason for it is for your perfecting and you want to be a better Christian and you want to walk better and do better and and act more like Jesus come on now I don't draw up on me y'all know this is true exhortation of Divine Healing brother Brown said now sometimes I would admit this that our heavenly father sometimes I apologize that's a little bit small I wouldn't expect it to be that small I was doing this late at night and uh I I usually do a better job of blowing this up so y'all forgive me y'all gonna show me some Grace yeah all right that our heavenly father sometimes chastens us with sickness that's so these are quotes on how God chastens us when we do wrong and we need to be corrected that our heavenly father sometimes chastens us with sickness permitting Satan to do it to try us sometimes to bring us back if we go out of the way then our heavenly father might let something happen to us to bring us back right so that's one way that God chases that he gets that gives us a little good whipping by letting us get real good and sick to make us realize that we need God to get things straightened up to be to to have a little old me moment oh oh I need oh God I need you on the scene you know when you get a real good case of the flu or something and you're laying there you you start thinking different don't you oh Lord I need you and the message the supernatural he said our heavenly father we come to thee on this sabbath day raining on the outside we might call it Gloom hazy rainy weather now look what he's trying to say gloomy hazy rainy weather but how could the farmer put in his crops if we didn't have much moisture this spring there'd be no food raised ground would be dry people would perish we we realize that this is like experience of a Christian sometimes we have to go through terrible chastisement chastening of the Lord many things to correct us that will be fruit bearing Christians so those gloomy hazy periods of our life where things don't seem like they're going right oh that that's what where God is molding your character I I was talking to a young person the other day about how he just could not understand how some like young young people can be mean to one another sometimes and people were talking bad about him and stuff and saying horrible things but you know you look back at those times where some maybe it may be another Christian said something mean and horrible and even what at what it is God is molding your what's he doing is he's molding your character to a place where you don't react badly anymore well maybe at first you wanted to get revenge you wanted to get back at that person but God is using that to mold your care he's using the gloomy dark times to change you for your for your better yeah and the layout of see in church age he said now he says to his own as many as I love I rebuke and chasten to rebuke is to prove to rebuke to reprove is to expose with a view to correction chasing does not mean to punish it means to discipline because the subject's amendment is in mind like a Potter making something amen and the layout of Satan Church he said here it is now set forth the love of God he desired and loved a family of his own a family of sons like himself there before him lies all mankind as one lump of clay out of that same lump he will now make vessels unto honor and unto dishonor the choosing will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of the spirit will be trained to conform to His Image in their walk so what Paul's asking us is can you endure the training when you come to church and I I don't want to be trained to be a Christian then it shows that you're not it shows that you're like Paul said to be plain a bastard he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with Nell's guard hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order that he may rebuild it exactly as he desires now that's what's painful when you get broken down when you're broken down wrestling with the angel like Jacob was wrestling at night and you're just broken down and you're tore up and there's snot all over the floor and that's where God wants to eat you sometimes but it is love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be in Revelation Chapter 3 Verse 18 it says I counsel thee divide me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness did not appear and anoint thine eyes with ourselves that thou may see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten so you know he loves you when you're getting straightened up you know he loves you when you're getting straightened up and Jesus at the door he said notice what our lord said all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution every son that cometh to God must first be tried chasten child training now that's what we don't like we don't he's going to try you to see if your character holds he's going to try you to see if you're patient if you really got patience give you put you in a little circumstance to see if you if your patience really holds put you in a circumstance to see if you're going to fly fly off the handle with a temper to see if that Temperance really hold or not he'll put you through trials and Things No Exceptions every son that cometh to God must be tried and the message Fellowship he said and many people think sometime because disaster happens to a Christian oh he got off the will of God they left the church they went out sometimes that's not right because God chastens every son that comes to him he cleanses him and purges him and tries to see if he will stand that's what he was doing in the time of job now let's look let's take a closer look at how God chastens you now chasing means to correct by punishment or suffering to put you through a really hard time now now it's one way he'll chasing you is to give you you'll you'll you'll be pricked in your heart when you do something wrong you know you've done something wrong maybe you slip up and you go you go drink some alcohol or something you know you shouldn't be doing that and boy you get away what kind of whipping you get you down on the inside something will be grieved and you just won't be able to stand it you won't be able to you won't be able to get away from that prayer closet it'll be drawing you to just get down on your knees and make things right and and that's the kind of whipping oh oh you you know that something Supernatural is taking place when you mess up and up down on the inside you just can't stand it you say something harsh to somebody and something on the inside you know I've heard people say well like almost like there's something wrong with you if you have regret when you do something wrong no no that that's right that's the good that's that's a sign that God is dealing with you that that that's almost the same one of the evidence is that that God is living in your soul is when you mess up that you feel bad about it and you want to go make it right that's a good little whipping from God that there's something on the inside that's calling you and drawing you to make things right unpleasant circumstances that God will make you that God will bring you through a path of your journey where that it's gloomy and cloudy and and uh uh everything is not going right maybe a situation at work where you're just getting pounded and of course what he's trying to get you bring you to a place where you get on your knees and you just have confidence in God that he's going to bring you through maybe maybe an unpleasant circumstance where you're looking at your kids doing wrong and you're oh God something's got to happen and you begin to put all of your confidence and all of your faith in God instead of your own abilities that's what the chastening of the Lord does it brings you to a place where you it's like you're all the juice is getting squeezed out that's why we shouldn't we rejoice in chasten and Chase oh when you look at it this way chastening is is is is such a beneficial thing for us your loss of Peace relationship fractures physical illness or even death in First Corinthians 11 30. now that's a good a good you see maybe one of your loved ones will pass away and you begin to really think about things differently maybe a young person looking at that to recognize that you're not going to be able to live in this Earth forever the way that you are you begin to see things different you begin to that's God chastening you now we can see in the cycle of Judges that God will chasten them in the Old Testament the Israelites would they would get real happy and prosper and everything would be going really well and then they start to get away from God and what would he do he'd he'd start squeezing them letting the amorites come in and beat up on him a little about a while until they started looking back to God for Faith and straightening up their life getting things getting things straight again and then God would send them a judge and they'd put their confidence in God and God would deliver them and they could they would keep repeating that over and over and over again as many times as they would repeat it God would squeeze them again Hebrews 12 verse 9 says furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own pleasure for what does that mean for their after their own pleasure you got a father in the flesh maybe he's running a business and he's like you got to get up and he'll you know yank the covers off of you or whatever time to go to work and he's chasing you for his play he wants he wants the money for the business he wants to keep the family prosperous or whatever he wants you know that kind of thing but that's not God is doing it for your Prophet he's chastening you not to make money or for anybody to be popular or all those kind of things but he's doing it he's chasing you to mold you into the character of a real Christian but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless afterwards amen it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby and I think all of us this morning that have gone through chasing and you can look back and remember the chastening in in a more positive light than when you were going through it you can look back and thank God that God took me through those times it was it was rough maybe when you were getting bullied and people were saying rough things and maybe you were sick on your bed a hospital bed or whatever but when you look back and see how God brought you through those situations and changed you for the better it's all worth it wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and it makes straight paths for your feet unless that which is lame be turned down to the way but let it rather be healed what is he saying he's saying be encouraged all these things are for your benefit so just keep like this man here going down the going down the trail just keep walking keep going because you're running a race and you've got to endure and you've got to be patient don't get discouraged follow peace with all men he's saying in verse 14. and Holiness with without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man feel of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he saw that carefully with tears and this will be a good place to stop for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they that heard and treated that the word shall not be spoken to them anymore for they commit could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart as so terrible was the the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake and we'll get on that next time but what he's talking about is the story maybe you can read this as your homework read Exodus 19 and 20 because that is the story of of Israel when God wanted to have a relationship with them and they and they turned it down and said we won't we just want you to talk through Moses and we want a lot of stuff to do it's Devin having a instead of God showing his grace to us and it's having a relationship and that's what Paul is saying here now you now in the Old Testament they had that that they were looking at but now ye are not coming to that but you are come under the promise of the Living God and we'll stop on that God bless you all right [Applause]
