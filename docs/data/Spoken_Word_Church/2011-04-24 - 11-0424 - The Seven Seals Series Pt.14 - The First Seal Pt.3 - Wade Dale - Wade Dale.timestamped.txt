[0:46] it all right Revelation chapter 6 and
[0:49] for those of you that are here for the
[0:52] first
[0:53] time bless your heart thanks for coming
[0:56] we uh we missing somebody your wife your
[1:00] wife June's coming out
[1:03] she oh wait till she gets here
[1:19] yeah yeah leave it
[1:28] down thank you all right Revelations
[1:32] chap
[1:34] 6 you're on the Lord's time now not
[1:41] mine now what we're doing down in the
[1:44] class for the past few months is we've
[1:46] been on the uh the breach and now we're
[1:48] going into the first seal and we were
[1:50] talking about last
[1:52] Sunday excuse me a few things that U
[1:55] that we need to cover I want you to keep
[1:58] in mind that there was an actual
[2:01] breaking of a
[2:02] seal then there was an actual spiritual
[2:05] application of that seal and then there
[2:08] was a part that's going to be to the
[2:10] Jews in these seals because the the two
[2:14] prophets that go to Israel are going to
[2:18] break the seals
[2:20] now especially on the six seal brother R
[2:23] said the prophets are those seals so
[2:25] they're going to be on the earth and we
[2:27] are not going to see the literal
[2:30] opening of that seal if you do you
[2:33] missed it right okay if you do you just
[2:37] missed you Miss the Rapture like brother
[2:39] Jim was talking about last night night
[2:41] before last you know these things are
[2:42] going to happen we're going to have a
[2:44] little time of tribulation for ourselves
[2:46] but these things that are that are that
[2:49] the Lord is talking about here in the
[2:51] seals are not going to happen to you and
[2:54] I we're going to be out of here because
[2:57] there's a literal opening of the seal
[2:59] all right you're going to have these
[3:01] plagues you're going to have these
[3:02] things that are going to happen you say
[3:04] what about the white horse rider well
[3:06] see we're going to have to pick through
[3:07] this and I don't for a better word say
[3:09] pick through this and I want we're going
[3:11] to really spend a lot of time on each
[3:14] seal we're going to talk about the horse
[3:16] the power um and last Sunday we were
[3:20] talking about power power was given unto
[3:24] him who given to the devil there is only
[3:27] one power and that's the power of
[3:28] almighty God
[3:30] there is a permitted power that he
[3:32] permits Satan to work in the uh Arena of
[3:36] of being
[3:38] Supernatural cuz he is a supernatural
[3:40] being Satan can pass out Supernatural
[3:42] gifts you can be just as lost as lost
[3:44] can be and have all the supernatural
[3:46] gifts because what Satan was the next
[3:49] man to God he was the worship Angel he
[3:51] knows how to
[3:52] worship he knows how to deceive more
[3:54] than anybody on the face of the Earth
[3:56] all right there's only one person he
[3:58] can't deceive and that's God and if you
[4:00] have him in your heart then you're still
[4:02] going to have a hard time cuz you this
[4:03] fell is going to have a hard time this
[4:05] one you're looking at this sticky guy
[4:07] okay but in these seals says I saw when
[4:10] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[4:12] heard as it were the noise of Thunder
[4:14] one of the four beasts saying come and
[4:15] see I saw and behold a white horse now
[4:19] remember let's go back to what we were
[4:21] talking about in the breach what is John
[4:25] doing John is a
[4:28] scribe John John is writing what he
[4:31] sees all
[4:33] right the angel told John write these
[4:37] things and send them to the church he
[4:39] didn't say interpret them he said write
[4:41] them he didn't say interpret John does
[4:44] not give an interpretation through all
[4:46] the Book of Revelations this is God
[4:49] actually telling a man what to write
[4:51] down and showing him the symbols of it
[4:53] all right that's why John was so struck
[4:56] when he got to Revelations 10 and he saw
[4:58] those Thunders open and he got started
[4:59] to write it and God said hold
[5:02] on because it wasn't for them it's for
[5:05] us it was for one special group of
[5:08] people right the bride in the end time
[5:10] oh yeah not down through the seven
[5:12] Church ages the bride in this day right
[5:14] here the day that we're in right now
[5:15] that's what you and I are living under
[5:18] is the opening of those Thunders which
[5:20] we are going to see that's the voice of
[5:22] God when God breaks the seal to you so
[5:24] the Thunders is not going to be a public
[5:26] show it's not going to be something that
[5:27] you're going to go outside and see this
[5:29] great big show of of um a worldwide
[5:33] campaign no it's just going to happen in
[5:34] your little everyday life it's going to
[5:37] help you live it's going to help you do
[5:39] things it's going to be that time that
[5:41] you need God and like brother Jim was
[5:42] talking about last night if you need a
[5:44] pork
[5:45] chop God's not going to just give you
[5:47] the pig he going to give you a pork chop
[5:49] cuz when Jesus handed out fish it wasn't
[5:50] raw fish and they had to go cook it
[5:52] that's right something brother Brown
[5:54] said boy what kind of chemical was that
[5:56] that released cuz when Jesus broke that
[5:59] fish it was already cooked and and
[6:01] seasoned and ready to eat so you know we
[6:04] can ask God for things for for animals
[6:07] and and game and stuff but hey sometimes
[6:10] we may need a one of those what they
[6:12] call them in the in the service Mr those
[6:15] meals ready to eat so they ready to eat
[6:19] we may need an M from
[6:21] God so and he'll give it to us you
[6:24] remember there was a brother that that
[6:26] that lived in Atlanta that brother
[6:28] Harris always told about
[6:30] that went to Brother Henry's church that
[6:31] he prayed one time and said said when
[6:33] they open their eyes they was porch out
[6:34] sitting on their on their on their track
[6:37] on the plate so you know brother Harris
[6:40] even leaning you know praying and saying
[6:41] God I don't have enough money I've only
[6:43] got you know $20 or $40 to pay my bills
[6:47] and my bills are $200 and the Lord told
[6:49] him just start counting and he started
[6:50] counting and the 20 started coming he
[6:52] just kept counting till he need
[6:53] $200 now God didn't give him 40 of them
[6:56] he gave him what he needed he didn't
[6:58] give him what he wanted he said he would
[7:00] Supply our needs not our wants
[7:03] okay and I saw when a lamb open one of
[7:05] the
[7:06] seals verse two and I saw and behold a
[7:09] white
[7:10] horse and he that sat on him had a bow
[7:13] and a crown was given un him a power a
[7:18] crown was given unto him because hey
[7:20] when we see a crown what's the first
[7:21] thing we think of somebody of of of
[7:25] great stature somebody that's got a
[7:27] great lineage somebody that's you know
[7:29] that some you place a crown this this
[7:31] guy you know that just got married over
[7:33] in England Prince William or one of them
[7:35] you know he hasn't wore the crown yet so
[7:36] he just Prince William but one day when
[7:38] Grandma dies he's the next one in line
[7:40] so guess what one day when they put the
[7:43] crown on top of him he becomes king
[7:45] William all right so Crown a crown was
[7:48] given to this person
[7:51] him okay so it's a
[7:54] person and brother randam you know he
[7:57] we'll go through it a little bit later
[7:58] but he says remember you you can't Crown
[7:59] a
[8:01] spirit you Crown a person
[8:04] him all
[8:07] right and he went forth
[8:10] conquering and to conquer
[8:13] now this white horse that John of course
[8:18] you got to really get in and see and
[8:20] I've been praying that the Lord help me
[8:21] to get into the vision that John saw not
[8:23] to try to be anything special but if I'm
[8:26] going to teach this I need to know
[8:27] exactly what John was you know John was
[8:29] a type of me and you remember one man
[8:32] brother BR said John typed the bride
[8:35] entire bride right from from Ephesian
[8:38] Church age to the Le ofan Church age so
[8:41] John typed all those people all the
[8:43] bride but John is sitting there and he
[8:46] is seeing a scene go across and he sees
[8:50] this man get on this horse and he's
[8:51] riding along and then they there's a
[8:53] crown appears and he sees this white
[8:55] horse ride off and he went forth
[8:58] conquering in and to conquer so John was
[9:00] not seeing this man just riding a horse
[9:04] he said conquering and to conquer so he
[9:06] was watching this guy this person he was
[9:10] watching him do something cuz if you and
[9:13] I were just sitting here and we had a TV
[9:15] screen we just saw a guy stand on a
[9:16] white horse and he just rides and gets
[9:17] to the end of the screen and rides on
[9:19] well you know you couldn't say he was
[9:21] conquering or or conquering or too
[9:23] conquer anything cuz it says conquering
[9:25] and to conquer he's conquering so what
[9:27] John saw was is this person this this
[9:31] this man on this horse riding into maybe
[9:34] a group of
[9:35] people um something because he said
[9:38] conquering and to conquer so he was
[9:40] conquering then and he was going to
[9:42] continue conquering on down Through the
[9:44] Ages all right and who was this person
[9:46] many people in the denominational realm
[9:48] believe that was God because it was a
[9:50] white horse I mean my anybody rides on a
[9:52] white horse ought to be a good guy
[9:54] usually in the in the in the in the old
[9:57] days you the old the the bad guy rode
[10:01] Black Horse and and U Long Ranger rode
[10:05] White Horse right but remember this guy
[10:08] is trying to deceive
[10:11] you I was just thinking he doesn't have
[10:13] his sword yet that's correct it starts
[10:17] as a little saying so that's how he
[10:19] started that's right he started innocent
[10:23] that was that's my next point he started
[10:25] innocent he's on this horse and
[10:26] everybody's
[10:28] going remember John saw this church saw
[10:32] it as a woman and he admired her but she
[10:34] was a
[10:36] let's be honest you prostitutes
[10:39] are not ugly they're usually very
[10:41] beautiful because it's alluring it's
[10:44] something that's trying to trap you
[10:45] something pull you in you know okay so
[10:49] that's what he's going to to Satan is
[10:51] not going to use a secondhand
[10:54] man Satan's on this horse
[10:57] himself okay but the whole the whole of
[11:00] of Christendom down through time thought
[11:02] this guy this person on this horse was
[11:05] some champion and even the prophet he
[11:07] said his he preached a mighty conqueror
[11:10] in 1957 and 1958 he preached a mighty
[11:13] conqueror again he used that scripture
[11:14] right there and said that was the holy
[11:17] ghost riding through conquering what
[11:20] this flesh guy and taking over well
[11:24] that's not
[11:25] true so brother brandham grew in Grace
[11:28] and knowledge
[11:29] he said hisself and we're going to read
[11:31] it cuz you know this brings a lot of
[11:34] people's
[11:35] eyebrows up but let's take and look in
[11:37] the first
[11:47] seal let's turn to the page one in this
[11:51] composite book
[11:54] 104 I mean 105 and it is the first page
[11:57] of the first seal paragraph number
[12:01] four now watch this book was
[12:05] sealed the Bible was sealed up even
[12:07] brother Brandon being a prophet sure he
[12:09] opened a lot of the word but there was a
[12:11] part of that word that nobody had looked
[12:13] into remember talking about last Sunday
[12:15] when he whipped that top off of the off
[12:17] of that pyramid Top Mountain and looked
[12:19] down and he saw those words that was
[12:21] never been seen by man before that's
[12:24] what we're fixing to get into okay first
[12:27] seal page four paragraph
[12:29] four and today I had something to happen
[12:32] that I haven't had for a long time I was
[12:33] studying on this on this Revelation here
[12:35] on the opening of the seal what's he
[12:37] talking about first seal years ago I run
[12:41] through it here about some 20 years ago
[12:43] I guess or something like that but
[12:44] somehow or another I never was just
[12:47] exactly satisfied seemed like there was
[12:49] something some things especially in
[12:52] those seals because those seals are the
[12:53] entire book see it's the book the whole
[12:56] book is one book seal all right now now
[12:58] let's turn over to page
[13:02] 109 actually go to paragraph 36 35 35
[13:07] paragraph 35 of the first seal all
[13:11] right and now the lamb is standing now
[13:13] tonight as we enter into this sixth
[13:15] chapter he's got the book in his hand
[13:17] and starting to reveal it and oh I would
[13:20] have absolutely today and I hope that
[13:23] people are spiritual remember what
[13:24] brother Jim's been preaching on
[13:26] spiritual right there's a spiritual
[13:29] application to
[13:32] everything I would have had a horrible
[13:35] mistake on that if it hadn't been about
[13:38] 12:00 today when the Holy Spirit came in
[13:40] the room and corrected me on something
[13:42] that I was writing
[13:43] down to say I was taking it from an old
[13:47] context he was writing down his old
[13:50] notes where he had preached that the
[13:52] that the white horse rider was the holy
[13:54] ghost riding through that first church
[13:57] age which would would have exalted Satan
[13:59] To His Highest position if brother
[14:01] brandham had have stepped out but see
[14:03] God wasn't going to let that happen God
[14:05] needed these seals to be open Pure and
[14:07] unadulterated amen all right so he was
[14:10] protecting not the man he was protecting
[14:12] his gift he was protecting the gift that
[14:15] he given the man because the man brother
[14:16] Brandon many times and I've got Circle
[14:18] it in all these he'll say I don't know I
[14:20] don't have a clue what the next heal is
[14:22] and he did when he when he come to this
[14:24] page right here and he knew right then
[14:26] that all that he had taught was not
[14:28] wrong wrong it was just in a baby
[14:31] form but that Satan had actually blinded
[14:35] his
[14:36] eye he said it himself he would have
[14:38] made a horrible mistake right if he
[14:41] would have preached it the way he
[14:42] preached it in 1957 the mighty conquer
[14:45] 1958 the mighty conquer he would have
[14:47] exalted Satan To His Highest position
[14:49] but being a word prophet he could not do
[14:51] that God was not going to allow that to
[14:53] happen so he come in the room at 12:00
[14:56] open that seal and then brother ROM knew
[14:58] right then that he was not going to be
[15:00] in the picture that whole week it was
[15:01] going to be God Butz he said if you are
[15:03] spiritual right if you people are
[15:07] spiritual you'll understand what
[15:09] happened well a lot of them that were
[15:10] sitting there thought they were and they
[15:13] weren't cuz you get on over about the uh
[15:17] the U questions and answers and he said
[15:19] this ain't even for you people it's gone
[15:22] from you there's no way for even there
[15:24] there there's no way for you to
[15:25] understand
[15:26] it but he said there'll be a group of
[15:28] people
[15:29] and this is a group of people this is
[15:31] the group that was supposed to
[15:33] understand it we were all born out of
[15:35] what do you see them just like Paul said
[15:38] just like brother R said we born out of
[15:39] due time but no we were born just right
[15:42] when we were supposed to be born because
[15:44] it took 40 something years to get all
[15:46] that old understanding out of our brain
[15:48] and get this not this new way it's the
[15:51] same old gospel that was preached 2,000
[15:53] years ago by Jesus Christ cuz Jesus
[15:56] Remember in Matthew he preached six
[15:59] seals in Matthew 24 cuz what does he say
[16:02] let's go you need to keep your marker in
[16:04] Matthew and
[16:06] Revelation Matthew
[16:11] 24 first seal is verse 5 of chapter 24
[16:15] for many shall come in my
[16:18] name saying I am Christ and shall
[16:21] deceive
[16:24] many who was that white horse rider now
[16:28] we know let's get the basic now we know
[16:31] that the
[16:33] horse was a
[16:37] symbol of
[16:39] what
[16:42] power a horse is a power a charger
[16:45] something you're right it's got power
[16:47] that's why they call the horse power yes
[16:50] all right and the man that was sitting
[16:52] on this horse something had to be given
[16:55] to him now there's nothing ever had to
[16:57] been given to God right
[16:59] nothing nothing zero God don't learn
[17:03] something new if God don't know it now
[17:06] he never knew it to start with and he's
[17:08] not God but God knew the very the very
[17:11] words I was going to choose today he
[17:13] knew that before this world was even
[17:15] created right in his mind all this was
[17:19] finished we can't comprehend that but
[17:22] that's a God that I like I like one
[17:24] that's in control that knows it's going
[17:25] to happen before it gets here all right
[17:28] and he works the Bible says he works
[17:29] things to his perfect will he'll let it
[17:31] work in permissive will but he always
[17:33] works to his perfect will right so we
[17:36] got a
[17:37] horse saw a white horse and he that sat
[17:41] on him had a
[17:44] bow all
[17:46] right got a
[17:49] bow what
[17:51] else no arrows no arrows
[17:55] sh you
[17:57] say
[17:59] I said what else I don't want
[18:01] to let me teach this
[18:09] class all right now he had a bow with no
[18:13] arrows
[18:17] surprise J when you teach a bunch of
[18:19] people it's already been taught it's
[18:20] kind of hard they know where you going
[18:24] but anyway maybe Lord bring out
[18:25] something that you really didn't know
[18:27] but anyway so he had a bow and watch a
[18:29] crown was what
[18:34] mhm
[18:38] him it was given
[18:40] him given to him power was given
[18:45] so now let's take
[18:48] the natural part of
[18:52] it this man Satan as soon as the
[18:56] resurrection happened which is today
[18:58] today all in chrisom we we uh honor the
[19:02] resurrection of Jesus Christ okay uh
[19:05] there's only one empty tomb I can't
[19:07] explain about e about Enoch and all
[19:10] those but the Bible says that as only
[19:12] one man had reached immortality right
[19:16] that means one time he was a mortal now
[19:18] he is Immortal even Lazarus was raised
[19:21] from the death from the dead out of a
[19:24] grave mortal but he was raised mortal
[19:27] and he died died right okay there's only
[19:31] one man that died a human
[19:34] death raised from that dead and he'll
[19:37] never die no more right and that body
[19:40] that he resurrected in is the same body
[19:41] he walked on the face of the Earth with
[19:43] it was just changed into a new or a
[19:46] younger State younger condition that's
[19:49] why we don't believe at this church that
[19:50] you get a new body I know people teach
[19:52] that I was at a Baptist Church one time
[19:55] when I first started coming back to the
[19:56] Lord I had a friend I was trying to
[19:58] trying to get him to understand the
[19:59] message and he said you come church with
[20:01] me I said okay so anyway the pastor gets
[20:04] finished preaching a real wonderful
[20:05] sermon about um about Samson and the U I
[20:09] just killed an
[20:10] aunt it wasn't my aunt a aunt but
[20:16] uh I he he was preaching a very
[20:18] wonderful sermon about um Samson when he
[20:20] lit those Fox's tails and let him run
[20:22] through the fields you know and it burnt
[20:23] their fields I mean buddy he was he
[20:25] kicked his shoes off he was just an old
[20:26] Baptist but when they got finished
[20:28] outside he went outside but and he lit
[20:30] up a cigarette he smoking one right
[20:32] after the other just coughing up up a
[20:34] storm and and one of the brothers say
[20:36] said Brother Don said said you better
[20:38] quit that smoking said you you know you
[20:41] could kill you you know I mean I can see
[20:43] it just now he he took a big old draw
[20:45] off that cigarette and he said it don't
[20:47] matter I'm going to get me a new body
[20:49] anyway I'm not going to have this one I
[20:51] thought yeah
[20:53] buddy it may be on fire like that is
[20:57] too
[21:00] but Jesus resurrected in the same body
[21:02] that he Resurrection is not
[21:04] replacement okay what went down come
[21:06] back that's right Redemption is not
[21:09] doing something halfway right right no
[21:12] Adam's going to raise in the body he
[21:14] lived in Abraham's going to raise in the
[21:16] body he lived in Jesus raised in the
[21:18] body he lived in it was just made or
[21:20] quickened into a younger condition same
[21:23] way with you and I I don't want a you
[21:24] body I like me okay I don't want to get
[21:27] I want to have a new one where you going
[21:29] to get it from the Bible says we all
[21:31] came out of this Earth and back before
[21:34] it
[21:35] was you know it's tilting like this now
[21:38] but back when it was straight up and
[21:39] down we were here and we were going to
[21:42] come in a perfect condition but when the
[21:44] fall happened knowing the ark and all
[21:47] those things of sin came on the
[21:49] earth you can't take this one CU they
[21:52] said flesh and blood will not inherit
[21:54] the Kingdom of Heaven well flesh and
[21:56] blood that your mom and daddy gave you
[21:57] want
[21:59] right okay but you do have a
[22:02] body and I just believe just as simple
[22:06] as I can believe that we're not going to
[22:07] go to heaven and live eternity and not
[22:12] have blood in our veins or a lungs or or
[22:15] eyes or ears I mean we're not going to
[22:16] be Spooks brother R said we're going to
[22:18] live as human beings cuz when he went
[22:21] across that curtain of time he did not
[22:23] see Casper the Friendly Ghost he saw
[22:26] human beings that he hug and not be no
[22:29] sin involved that just Thrills my
[22:33] heart that just Thrills my heart that
[22:35] you that you know you can you can hug
[22:37] your sister over there and not have a
[22:38] sensation see the only sensation we get
[22:40] is cuz Mom and Daddy bore this body
[22:42] right see that's why it's got to be
[22:44] changed it didn't say exchange it said
[22:46] changed so this body is going to be
[22:48] changed in the morning twinking of night
[22:50] how we got into that I don't have a clue
[22:52] anyway White
[22:54] Horse White Horse is a white
[22:58] righteous
[23:00] looking I mean you look at a white horse
[23:02] and you just think of Purity clean you
[23:05] know
[23:06] you perfect just yeah complete just a
[23:10] something
[23:11] beautiful and and it just brings back in
[23:13] our memory you know Long Ranger and a
[23:15] good guy and all that stuff you know
[23:17] what Satan knew that he didn't start out
[23:20] on a black horse he started out on a
[23:23] white horse he started out to conquer
[23:26] what
[23:29] me and
[23:30] you so the day that Jesus
[23:33] resurrected and ascended and come back
[23:35] on the day of Pentecost and the Holy
[23:36] Ghost the devil came right with
[23:39] him and got on this white righteous
[23:43] horse because John in first John he
[23:46] tells us he said the Antichrist is here
[23:50] and then Paul comes over in his writings
[23:53] and he said Grievious wolves are among
[23:55] you
[23:56] now people had already started
[23:59] infiltrating that church in ad.
[24:02] 60 we were 2,000
[24:05] years of Satan getting better and better
[24:09] at his
[24:10] tactic but this White Horse was the
[24:13] power the man that was on this horse had
[24:16] a
[24:17] bow now with no
[24:22] arrows brother randam was telling us
[24:26] about this and him being a hunter I'm
[24:28] sure he really thought in his mind I you
[24:31] know I wouldn't have killed that deer
[24:32] brother Jim if I had no arrows I if I
[24:35] just told Brother Jim and brother Jim's
[24:36] the one that we that Dad and I and
[24:38] brother Richard and brother Danny go out
[24:40] to be so gracious to let us not on his
[24:42] property and if I would have went
[24:44] hunting and had bought a thousand that
[24:46] bow I got Hy it's $1,000 the bow the bow
[24:51] all tricked out is $1,000 all right
[24:54] sorry I just like to have the
[24:56] best but anyway it's paid
[24:59] for but you know what if I have got up
[25:01] on that stand and and and and literally
[25:04] bought the best if I'd have spent
[25:06] $10,000 on everything I had bought the
[25:11] license bought the license and
[25:14] everything I mean the license are almost
[25:17] $400 you're spending all this money I'll
[25:20] see yall next
[25:22] week we might not make it to to the
[25:26] church but anyway I'm making a point
[25:29] here if I would have spent all that
[25:32] money and I told Brother Jim he said oh
[25:34] brother way there's a deer right I mean
[25:36] we got trail cameras and that deer just
[25:37] goes by every day and we see that same
[25:39] big buck go by every day and I go climb
[25:42] up in that b stand that we've got you
[25:44] know and brother Jim he goes out and
[25:45] pours out $100 worth of corn and we're I
[25:47] mean we just got this whole thing laid
[25:49] out and here I am standing up there you
[25:50] know and I got my bow ready and here
[25:53] comes the
[25:56] deer without that
[25:58] Arrow that's all that I spent and all
[26:01] that he done is worth zero he moving
[26:06] zero
[26:09] zero all right maybe we shouldn't have
[26:12] used that analogy let's back to tape up
[26:14] start
[26:15] over the point I'm trying to make is is
[26:18] Satan even putting himself on a
[26:22] horse getting him the best bow there
[26:25] is getting him the best anointing he can
[26:29] get he was
[26:31] worthless without those arrows right cuz
[26:35] what are you going to kill you can't
[26:37] kill nothing I mean you might could
[26:39] throw the bow and maybe hit the thing
[26:41] with it
[26:43] but like I was telling Danny brother
[26:45] Danny yesterday buying something to go
[26:47] in the back of his truck like a tun no
[26:49] cover like I got and hey if I'm going to
[26:52] get into this you get into
[26:54] it down with I told him I told him I
[26:57] said you need a bow he said well I need
[26:59] this cover this tunel cover I said well
[27:02] it's one thing for sure with a bow you
[27:04] can kill a deer I said but you might be
[27:06] able to pick that thing up and throw it
[27:07] at it but you won't think you'll hit
[27:08] anything with it I only have a $900 B so
[27:12] now you're in now you're in with
[27:15] me all right let's get back on our
[27:18] point but look at all these things that
[27:20] were given to this person you know what
[27:23] my whole point is Satan is powerless
[27:28] he has no power of himself right he
[27:31] couldn't do it alone thank you he
[27:34] couldn't do it alone next week Trudy
[27:36] will be handling
[27:39] the that's fine yes sir brother Jim
[27:42] we're kind of open here we let everybody
[27:44] talk they said what is what he say he
[27:46] went forth conquering if he didn't have
[27:48] no arrows he was a
[27:51] bluff he went forth to conqueror he was
[27:54] right and power was given to him see and
[27:57] this Crown that's what I was saying
[27:58] about a crown you know if if Prince
[28:01] William goes through life and he's just
[28:03] all nonchalant you know but one day you
[28:05] put a crown on his head everybody turns
[28:07] their
[28:09] attention see so what God had to do God
[28:12] allowed Satan to get these parts
[28:16] together but there was one thing he was
[28:18] missing and that was any power over you
[28:22] if God would have gave him the arrows he
[28:24] could not say to you it was your choice
[28:26] to do what you do
[28:28] right see God give him that's my whole
[28:30] point God give him this right here to
[28:32] work with right so who give it to
[28:40] it he gets his power from the people so
[28:45] now now you
[28:49] have a
[28:52] choice if he would have given Satan
[28:55] arrows you'd have never had a chance
[28:58] that's right he' have killed you to
[28:59] start with yeah but God allowed him not
[29:02] to have any arrows for you to make the
[29:05] choice because you're the guy that goes
[29:07] to the hardware store or to or to Bass
[29:10] Pro Shop and you don't just give him
[29:13] arrows that are crooked you buying the
[29:15] straightest $100 a dozen with a $50 fill
[29:20] point and what and we hand them to him
[29:23] we don't even let him come and get them
[29:25] we go here
[29:28] shoot him at me let mear
[29:31] right and I'm going to stand like
[29:34] this but if if God would to give him see
[29:37] God gives Satan what to work with except
[29:41] for one thing cuz if not there would be
[29:42] no choice that's what I saw when I saw
[29:45] this with no arrows that gave us a
[29:47] choice to give him the arrows or to
[29:49] reject it right and then to reject it
[29:52] then what's he going to do he's going to
[29:53] sit there and go binging going to pull
[29:55] the string back you're going to go
[29:59] the Bible says resist the devil even
[30:02] with all this right here he's sitting on
[30:04] a horse he sitting on a power which was
[30:06] given to him by the people the bow
[30:08] probably was also the
[30:11] crown we crown
[30:14] him Satan Superman remember what brother
[30:17] R called called the devil called the
[30:19] pope Satan
[30:21] Superman well we've got a Superman and
[30:23] we crown him king of kings and Lord of
[30:25] lords all right
[30:28] but he went forth and he was in symol he
[30:31] was going to try to
[30:34] be Christ y that's what he went out to
[30:38] be in that first church age because
[30:40] remember what Jesus said in Matthew he
[30:42] couldn't have done it any other way
[30:45] Matthew 25
[30:48] says there will be What fault
[30:56] Christ
[30:58] Matthew 24 for many shall come in my
[31:01] name saying I am Christ and shall
[31:05] deceive many he started in that first
[31:07] church
[31:09] age
[31:10] Conquering the
[31:13] people brother BR said remember Nick
[31:15] leoism niik was
[31:16] conquer Le was a Le so he went forth
[31:20] Conquering the people but if the people
[31:23] had a had a revelation that's why you
[31:25] and I have to we have to have the
[31:28] revelation of who he is now I'm going to
[31:30] make this statement and it's going to be
[31:32] out on the internet and I want I want to
[31:33] really thank the people that are
[31:35] listening cuz we've got a lot of hits on
[31:37] our Sunday school class which is great
[31:38] it's not me but I'm trying to get a
[31:40] point across to maybe some people that
[31:42] that um that need some teaching and it's
[31:45] hard to do people don't like teachers
[31:47] because they're so boring but to me
[31:49] brother Brown said teachers place you in
[31:50] the body so it places your mind in a
[31:52] place where you can get something from
[31:53] God all right but this was all placed
[31:57] here to deceive
[31:59] you even way back in its little
[32:02] infancy cuz like sister Trudy said as
[32:05] you see this man
[32:07] progress you're going to see he gets a
[32:10] sword now what's a sword then it's word
[32:14] right but it was given all this stuff
[32:16] was given to Satan right but right here
[32:19] you resist the devil and he'll flee from
[32:21] him even in a Christian
[32:24] condition and I'm going to make this
[32:25] statement then we'll they then we'll
[32:28] stop CU I got to go hook brother Jim up
[32:30] with
[32:31] his
[32:33] thing even a born again
[32:38] believer down through the church
[32:41] ages Satan
[32:43] conquered their
[32:47] flesh everybody understand that that's
[32:49] hard to swallow but Satan is the only
[32:51] one that can kill the outside guy
[32:53] remember God's one that can kill the
[32:55] soul Satan can't kill the soul but he or
[32:57] take your outside guy and kill him okay
[33:00] because what we give him the power to do
[33:03] that the power in the people the power
[33:05] in denominational ideas the power in cuz
[33:09] Satan people there's more I'm going to
[33:12] make this statement there's
[33:15] more Devils preaching today than they
[33:19] are true Born Again
[33:21] believer sorry if I hurt your
[33:24] feelings but there's more people in the
[33:27] because of what because of right here it
[33:30] can't be any other way we're at the end
[33:32] time there's no other Church AE to pick
[33:34] this up and take another idea there's no
[33:37] other idea this is it right we either go
[33:40] by the grave or we go to Glory one of
[33:42] the two we don't go to another church
[33:44] age messenger or to another church age
[33:46] all right for many sh many shall come in
[33:50] my name didn't Jesus say fear or not
[33:51] little flock that's right he said right
[33:54] here for many shall come in my my name
[33:57] saying I am
[33:59] Christ and shall deceive
[34:03] many many not a few many when Noah
[34:09] preached there was what eight people
[34:11] that was it he preached 120 years to
[34:15] congregations the Bible says that as it
[34:17] was in the days of Noah so it is today
[34:19] so guess what whatever was here today
[34:22] was in Noah's age you say w all this
[34:25] technology you got to remember number
[34:27] one thing the water didn't just wash
[34:30] this Earth
[34:31] off it's proven we're living off of dead
[34:34] plants and animals and people from the
[34:35] flood cuz those plates just flipped over
[34:37] and sat down and all this is way under
[34:40] the part under the Earth they're way up
[34:42] in the ice caps go to Alaska sometime
[34:44] and and they're just awesome I know
[34:45] brother Jim lived up there you see these
[34:47] big glaciers that are 500 ft deep of
[34:51] just nothing but solid ice what happened
[34:53] when the earth turned over on its axis
[34:55] it drew all that to the to the ice cap
[34:57] there's no telling what if ever all that
[34:59] melts you might find cars up there I it
[35:01] wouldn't bother me any if it did cuz the
[35:03] Bible says as it was in the days of Noah
[35:05] so shall it be when the days of the son
[35:07] of man the day we're living in right now
[35:09] okay so that's what happened to them I
[35:12] am Christ and shall deceive
[35:14] many now we're going to stay on that for
[35:16] a little while because we're the first
[35:17] seal we're going to continue on for for
[35:20] several more
[35:22] weeks but think about this one
[35:25] thing Satan
[35:27] Satan can deceive many but there's one
[35:31] person he can't deceive and that's the
[35:33] real Christ that's why if you don't have
[35:35] the Holy Ghost in your life or in your
[35:37] soul not just on your life in your soul
[35:39] if you're not a born again believer
[35:41] you're not going to understand because
[35:43] Satan's in there telling you what I yes
[35:47] sir nothing to it it's just something
[35:49] just a FNA say you know he's going to be
[35:51] sitting in there and guess who put him
[35:53] there we
[35:55] did any questions before we
[35:59] go if not next Sunday we'll start on
[36:02] stay on the same thing we'll be on the
[36:03] first seal for a while make sure you
[36:04] bring your books make sure you read that
[36:06] first
[36:25] seal
[36:27] that
[36:28] door in
[36:30] there well we boor in there you came I
[36:33] know they left that
[36:38] door called pulling and all that air
[36:40] conditioner coming
[36:50] through
