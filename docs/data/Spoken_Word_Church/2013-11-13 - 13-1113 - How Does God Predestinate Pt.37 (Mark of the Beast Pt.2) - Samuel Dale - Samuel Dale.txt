flags all right remember brother forney will be with us the lord willing on the 24th which will be a week from sunday and then brother timothy burdette will be with us on the watch night service i have never really heard brother burdette speak i've heard him testify well maybe we did maybe one of the fellowship meetings right yeah we did you know i'm sorry i was fixed and said never heard him but we didn't win the fellowship meeting but looking forward to that and what we're going to do that night now if he's not too too lengthy preaching you know we generally start at 8 00 8 30 we have the man to pull pit and let him preach as long as he wants to but if we have some time we want to have some fellowship around your testimonies it would be a good night to give a testimony something lord done for you this year you know we've done that before just a whole service you know you know so just let's get ready and we'll we'll have the testimony meeting after he gets through all right remember those things two we forgot i reckon all of us must have have forgotten about uh this past monday being veterans day and we certainly appreciate all these brothers here especially those on the internet that hear it we appreciate you as being a veteran and ladies i was reading today in the paper where they said seem like hall county had 600 and something female veterans and i said well okay you know and uh so we appreciate it you know for for the what they put forth and we appreciate a lot that's lost their lives that you and i can have the freedom we've got so we really appreciate it i had totally forgotten he went to the bank monday pull up into the bank and hey nobody here well they didn't shut it down i just forgot what day it was but we certainly do appreciate all of the veterans and things all this have done i was reading the other day where my one man said he was just a cook but you know what he he got a lot of medals he had a great big old thing full of medals and he was cooked so that was good you got to eat you know and all that but we appreciate it all right romans 8 and genesis 4. we've got part 1 part 2 part 3 of all of this that we've been trying to bring lately but uh i just get it on my mind and brother claude i certainly enjoyed this past weekend with him and to you on the internet if he didn't if you didn't get the afternoon on the live streaming or how y'all say that big old word uh you'll have to get it off of the other part because the uh internet system on their part went down not from us here and so you wouldn't allowed to to get it you know but i really appreciate brother claude i enjoyed what he had to say and putting like the first second third pull showing it in the scriptures comparing the scriptures and i really enjoyed that i thought it was a good point and and i appreciate him he's a good brother amen so romans 8 and genesis 4 father we thank you for this day and your grace and your love thank you for calvary because without that lord what good would the day be but with calvary in our mind we can be so happy of people to rejoice and realize that death has been conquered and we don't have to die all done finished and all we got to do is depend on you and lord we ask you to come with us tonight and now and just be here not as an onlooker to record our deeds but to be the preeminent one in each one of our hearts and lives that you can speak to us and guide us in your love in your grace forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you lord and just have your way we certainly do appreciate all of these veterans all of the service people that were there and spent their time because we wouldn't be free tonight if it wasn't for that so we thank you we love you and we honor your great name and guide us in jesus is that name amen and amen okay we go to where we've been reading in romans 1 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us that's a good point in it every time i'd like to preach on that a while that would be good all right let's go to to genesis you say well you've been preached on it 37 times not just 36. genesis 4 let's start reading about verse i don't know where they pulled up 11 uh or you know verse 11. because it's talking about cain and that's what we've been on on predestination and we covered the part of that we believe in predestination by foreknowledge that god foreknew and he knew what would happen in the garden he knew we would fall he knew if he made us gave us free moral agency we would fault he knew that but that didn't just leave the story blank but we're having to just cover the things that has been brought from there to here now but remember as he saw what jacob would do what he saw would do and could predestinate accordingly he saw what you and i would do he saw what they would do in the garden so he could predestinate according to what the people would do and that's all we're trying to do is see how that back there because if we keep looking back we're going to miss the whole story but if we look at ourselves and see ourselves in god's word and be able to just look right straight into the word and say lord help me not everybody else see we want to blame adam and eve brother and said you don't blame them now he said that's you and i their choices are now i can't say they caused it go see we caused it all right but look what he's saying to him he said in thou art cursed from the earth which had opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand remember he had killed him and yeah god has said where where's your brother and all of that when god tell us the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength now remember adam was over here the world was cursed with him and it said it won't be able to do well what about this is the x-tree placed upon cain now all right because already the earth is cursed instead of fugitive in a vagabond shall thou be in thy in the earth and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be head and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to price that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain venus will be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark on cain lest any finding him should kill him you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the to the reading of the word now what are we trying to cover or what have we tried to cover about it and we'll get back into this in a little bit but remember now you can read and it sounds like in the bible you can read it it sound like in the prophet and everything but did god put a mark on cain you know all right or really was it cain that marked his own self now it's like i've tried to show you the prophet said cain could have been saved if he'd done what was right god is still at the time dealing with cain all right and dealing with cain he's got to be awful why is he dealing with if he's not offering but see cain goes out you say well no the bible says the lord sent him out oh that's all well and good but get the point had he stayed in the presence of the lord look where he would have been at least he'd had an opportunity all right but if you say the we're going to read the prophet when he says that the mark that was put on cain was the mark of the beast and that mark of the beast is in your intelligence right when we get down to it where he said it's a trinitarian doctrine he said well there was no trinitarian doctrine back there well you explained why brother branham said he failed on hebrews 13 8. was it back there all right but you see my whole point that i've tried to get you to look at i believe that god didn't set a mark on cain of a different color race or a different water because that would have ended at the flood and it wouldn't work see and if blackness is a curse height blackness to be half cursed so we're high cursed you know that you can't run nothing like that the jews are where they're at and all that most of the time we are dark and we are are they cursed no they're god's people well then get it out of our minds something like that we get it out of our mind too that there's some kind of a of a mark to be put on where it says in your forehead you know it says in your hand well brother brown said we'll read it i mean he said it's not no tattoo all right you know he said that's not what it is well then there was no tattoo put on cane see cain displayed his unbelief by killing his brother he was already marked by unbelief all right but it's like i was trying to explain there to you i believe it you know i mean this is this is my belief that god didn't stamp cain with something it was cain's intelligence himself that drove him out from the presence of the lord what do you want to say god ran him out or whether he went out himself irregardless he went out all right that was the part of the display of the mark of the beast right by him going away from god displayed whatever had happened back here we know it was unbelief all right but it looked like reading that god put some kind of a mark on cain but i told you the best way i can understand that is adam should have killed cain i mean he killed his own son you ain't dealing with a new birth of trying to say well we pray for him you know no you're dealing back there is it don't you think adam thought a lot about what should i do he killed his brother he may kill us next we see he took away from adam or even at the lineage of adam to seth that would come on later when seth was said i'm due to kill my brother because he killed my brother you know all right you say well that wouldn't back there but if hebrews 13 8 was back there what about over in the scriptures you know where a brother would take an oath to kill it somebody killed his brother he went after him and you know that god didn't stop him unless it was something like he saw in jacob where he but what did he do what he saw on jacob he changed he saws thinking right and protected jacob so he changed adam's thinking to me that's what it means when he said he put a mark on him the word that nobody wouldn't kill him you know that protective mark must have lasted a good one because he went on and lived and had lineages but do you realize what if cain what if adam had killed kane i mean that's the way i think you know i'm sorry if adam had to kill cain that would have stopped the serpent seed lineage then how could god displayed his salvation or anything for anybody see then you wind up saying well what is the mark i said that about brother colley it was a great thing see that time when those brothers said well we don't know what the mark was it was put on cane and i was coming down the road and i said well brother collie i don't know what it was either and he said i know what it was that is the mark of the beast he said i just heard the prophet say it you know i might not have said it to him then but i'm just thinking well turn around go back up there and let him tell them fellers you know that i don't mean it wrong well they're they're what they're supposed to be all right but see it's the mark of the beast now what is the mark of the beast it can't be a tattoo it can't be a coloration of skin it can't be any kind of uh doings like that and the prophet said everybody in the world today either has the seal of god or the mark of the beast he said when i'm justified sanctified brother that will praise god but you're not born again so you still mark with the mark of the beast that's hard to say about our parents our kin folks our our loved ones or whatever you know maybe our children or whatever to look at them has to do it but being sympathetic with it's not going to change them you know i mean the best you can do is explain to them what thing is but explain it to him in love you remember we went through that and over where the cain said take it or leave it well i only thought the one quote was there that i wrote down 40 years ago that you know that where he said take it or leave it i've done all i'm going to do and and i didn't realize brother randle said so many times they would even relate down right to where you and i are today and he says 99 out of a hundred right you know 99 out of 100 i gave you that quote there last wednesday i guess it was it's saying just like cain i go to church i worship i do what else you want me to do i believe the message of the hour i'm you know i'm hunting fish for the prophet i i walk with the lord jesus as they'd say but see we take anything whatsoever different from a revelation where does that leave us anything i i don't care where it's you me who it is you know where does it leave us it leaves us in the same situation where cain was at and you say but the mark of the beast all right we'll get to one in a minute where brother branham you've heard him say it over and over and and i never really caught it as to be able to explain it until the other day when i was reading my notes on it and i'll read it in just a minute and uh brother branham said every doctrine there ever is come out of genesis and he said like this something i'll i'll read it i mean if i don't remember which one he said uh he said could you prove the assembly started in the garden well well see the church assemblies didn't start in the garden there was no church assemblies in the garden you know what i mean so what is he talking about when he says everyone he's talking about the spirit of the thing the spirit of those things is what was in the garden all right so then you can see then that the spirit of god was in the garden because there's two trees but the spirit of the antichrist or devil was in the garden and that's what caused them to do what they've done and that's what's causing us today to do what we're doing one spirit or the other is motivating us it's controlling us because there's only two powers right all right so then then what are we doing let's read a few because i don't want to stay so much on the mark of the beast anybody in the message has been around very long and you you you know that what it is because i i want to get down to the bot to the real part of the message but look what the prophet had to say now so we'll read a few of them e18 of the mark of the beast 61 216. we find out that the first marking of a human being started in genesis genesis 4 15 god mark cain that's where the first mark of the beast was ever put on was put on cane he's the beginning of it you say cain having the mark of the beast he said all right so he goes to explaining in that quote what the mark of the beast is look at the next one this is still off the this is e25 with the same message mark of the beasts are the seal of god uh part one and look what he explains and you'll see the difference a mark is a distinction it makes a difference it separates something but like you say you got one mark against you a mark but you never said you have one seal against you so there's a difference to mark and a seal right yeah brother branham will use them in both the same i checked it he'll use mark and seal and interrelate them that's fine but look what he's explaining but you never said you have one seal against you you've got one mark against you and a seal is a sign of ownership seal is a sign of onshore but what's tomorrow a mark is a distinction and the church is sealed by the holy gho holy spirit showing as ownership god owns the church but the mark of the beast is the wayward the outcasts that refused to take and come god's provided way cain as soon as he was marked was sent away we get that abel died and seth raised up to take his place was going on into the resurrection but think about what he's saying see today it's not just the outcast like we think i was listening to a tape the other day and brought around and said it like this he said i hope that this doesn't bother you he said i make this so strong he said until it looks like that you know that it's not religious people but he said it is i mean when you get over to jacob and esau with the thing we would have picked esau every time huh and you come down today to doing it i was thinking today what was at the chiropractor and seeing his view and his family there was i'm not saying they're no wrong or whatever i'm just saying there was pictures of his family that he says they all love the lord they're all serving the lord well amen but there are this haircut and pants and things we see they're serving but they've been taught that that's okay right i mean they wouldn't do it if they hadn't been taught it was okay maybe not somebody got it's okay to do this now you know what i'm saying but yet it's a religious society good people why would brother brown make a statement he said i'd rather have the church on the corner than a bureau joint or something you know honky tonks or something on the corner there we see we're so super religious you know i was just thinking about it the other day i'll say it see some people will say i just soon go down to walmart and walk around and go to a fellowship meeting i'll change the name to walmart to dick sporting good or cabela's or you know somewhere now you tell me that's right i mean it doesn't fit but that's our way of thinking we say well it don't make me spiritual to go no but am i happy to become spiritual right now we believe in predestination don't we amen amen what if it's predestinated as i said the other day we say well it's god's obligated to put it on the pulpit well what if that's where it's at where he's putting it i just come on i just put it that way just do what you want to and i'm not arguing with nobody whether you go or not but now when you tell me that it's the antichrist then i'm going to tell you everywhere you go saturday is antichrist that's all i'm going to say and i'm not trying to talk anybody in going to meetings and things i'm just telling you that we want to build those things like it's something but you see you say well you just turned down the word of the lord well what have you turned down you showed me going to walmart is the word of the lord come on but you see church we don't realize what's going on look at the next one e15 mark of the b seal of gods which is number two which is uh 61 216. that was 217 we've been dealing with going to the next one see i got a note today said could you prove that the assemblies of god started in in genesis i don't know about the organization but the spirit that's in the assemblies of god started in genesis now that that helped me whether it does you or not that really helped me because then i'm not looking for assemblies building in i'm looking at the spirit of things that's exactly right and all the other born-again churches started in genesis now all the other born-again churches started in genesis and all are supposed to be churches just nominal churches they started in genesis and they both was represented in the first two sons both cain and abel cain received the mark of the beast and was sent away we realized that the serpent which was the one that had deceived his mother was a beast and not a reptile he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field in genesis 14 or genesis 4 15 brother that god sent mark cain and as soon as cain was marked he went out of the presence of the lord what did you get it last night go back to the message part and listen to it what you think about it it's the spirit of things amen you know all right we we we're not i i've never claimed to be a prophet or anything like that i just claim to be a christian and try to preach all right but i don't walk by an assembly's church well i ain't going in there i'll get them bad spirits on me i don't care where it's assembled it's baptist methodist presbyterian are people in this message don't worry about going in there and getting bad spirits you've already got one and just like brother brandon we'll get to in a minute where he says the mark of the beast he said you're already marked he said the punishment comes later he says there's no middle of the road we either have the mark of the beast or we have the seal of god and if we're born again we've got the seal of god but if we're not born again we've got the mark of the beast but are we willing to admit it no i've been in church all of my life don't you tell me i got the mark of the beast more people you tell the people of this message that it's a serpent seed you know it's all mankind don't you tell me big boy don't you tell me that stuff i'm a predestinated seed just remember everything's predestinated look what he said on the true esther seal 1961 404 402 and satan's sons will be sealed in this last days satan's sons now how did he explain it i've got it in here somewhere but he said we're all born between satan and eve right i believe that's what he said we don't want to think about no i'm a i'm a i come up with my family come over on the mayflower don't you say nothing about the dales baloney stowaways probably satan's sons will be sealed in this last days there's a time now watch that the bible spoke that all that did not have the seal of god took the mark of the beast and we know the mark of the beast is what disbelief the first time where did you say the mark of the beast began in the garden of eden mark of the beast and seal of god was performed now watch both of them in the garden of eden now in the garden of eden you know as we would talk about it was revealed to abel right that it was blood right amen and if cain had took that and done what abel done he would have been all right so then cain had the mark of the beast and abel by revelation had the seal of god right right now think about it in the garden of eden mark of the beast and seal of god was performed in the garden of eden exactly it's performed through easter for the dead of abel brought forth saith the death of abel brought forth saith that's right notice cain was the son of satan he was the son of the beast which begot eve you can call it whatever you want to he was the son of satan and what did he do god put a mark on him and sent him out from the presence of god is that right and he got him a wife not out of the heritage of god but got him a wife from the land of nod another land so that's where everybody thinks there's another genealogies of people but just remember brother run said he took his sister that was the only way it could be because there were no other generations there wasn't more people created than adam and eve so he took his sister all right because they wouldn't record it in the genealogies so that's sensible he took his sister i like things to be sensible because i'm sensible thinking you know and that way i say hey that looks pretty good i believe that all right but think about it now look at the next one it says 10 virgins 144 000 1960 12 11 the morning service paragraph 3 19. and i just love him don't you yes sir oh what is the what is the seal of god holy ghost what is the mark of the beast reject it so when that pope or what he was the guy you know that the holy ghost tried to come on that brother and spoke of when he didn't receive it what did what did he do all right he rejected it and thereby prove what he was see that's the two one to see in a well there and how many was on the earth that didn't get it all that was not sealed took the mark of the beast all that all that had not the spirit of god had the mark of the beast the seal of god is the holy spirit the bible says so every place in the scripture speaks of it says it's the mark of god what the seal of god and all that did not have it was the one who rejected it and how did they reject it by by refusing to hear it think about that yeah refusing to hear it means you're already marked because you're refusing to hear it not hearing it is one situation right right but hearing it and refusing it all right think about it look at the next one just to get one or two where you could think on these things this is the the mark of the of the beast and seal of god number two um he's 75. it shall be light in the evening time that's right while evening lights are shining why don't you receive it why don't you come to it don't be sealed away don't sit dead believe on the lord jesus christ and be sealed into the kingdom what is the mark of the beast to reject the holy ghost see the borderline see after he once come to the knowledge of the truth for it is impossible for that for those which were once enlightened see coming up to the knowledge of the truth and seeing that they see the truth and see the knowledge of it see it's here see it's working see it's right and have a knowledge of the truth and then turn away again you know there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin just like cain at the beginning so will it be in the end see so we're going to say you're either sealed with christ or we have the mark of the beast now back to what i said a minute ago it's the seal of god all right but it's the mark of the beast and that's why when we get over in far enough you'll see that you have the mark in your forehead right either your hand or your forehead right but think about it now to reject the holy ghost all right off the next message is the token i think it is or the way of a true prophet to the way of the true prophet paragraph 3 3 43. and i must knew yes sir amos knew israel or ungodly lovers who would destroy them and their ungodly lovers of today will soon destroy them the very denominational creeds and things that they were there bound themselves into the pentecostals that's the thing is going to destroy you your creed and denomination it's going to destroy you yeah but i don't have it brother dale you're binding yourself right up yonder take the mark of the beast and don't even know it pulling it right over your eyes see it is a boycott what are you trying to do you belong with this or you don't belong so you just wait just get a little just a little bit longer then you say i'll get out of it then no you won't you're already in it you're already marked you're caught with a mark on you you remember in the the bible times are that like if you was in a in a city you know i forgot which way it goes but you had one year in a certain situation you had one year and and if you'd go out you could go out but if you didn't go out you smart so where are we at see i'm not preaching to somebody to say well well now what it is now uh everybody else is marked but the church at lula's in a in a gray area maybe somewhere in the no no no no you me every one of us we either got the seal of the holy spirit or we got the mark of the beast all right and don't think one of these days i'll get out of it he said you won't you're already in it see no matter esau wept bitterly when he knowed better but he went bitterly trying to find a place to repent and couldn't find it you stay there then now is the time to flee see if you're hearing it flee get out look at the next one the token prison 63 901 paragraph 232-233 and as we see the great end time signs on earth today we know that that's right that's right now look i've waited for this for a long long time for this message to you see and you've seen the end time signs and i've preached it to you and showed it to you by everything that christ said is that right congregation says amen you'll admit that amen we're at the end time i don't see nothing left you say what about the mark of the beast see they're saying what about the mark of the peace those who reject the holy spirit is already marked by the beast the punishment will come later punishment will come later you can't get out of it you're caught with it being there all right let's read one more then we'll try to pick up this is mark of the beast priest in 54 515 paragraph 233 you see what the mark of the beast is it's a mark of apostasy it's a person now here's his definition we may look it up and find apostasy here's his definition right it's a person who is just think that well i belong to church i'm just as good as the next fellow am not i belonging to this church and you realize where your church organization that you're dependent on where it come from don't you realize the bible said he's that worships the beast receives his mark or the letter of his name and watch in the forehead or hand he said that's knowledge or deed right now watch him that don't mean you've got a big tattoo on your face it don't have to be that it's not talking to the outward it's talking of spiritual now you watch him and see what he knows about the scripture listen to him and see where he goes to if any man don't have this doctrine there's no light on him the bible says watch where it goes to what's what he does because what will we do what did cain do when abel presented the truth to cain cain believed he was right and he was so right about it until he killed his brother isn't that enough i mean you know i mean i i differ with brother you know brother mark he differs me and i just take a gun shoot him let's go and i'm standing for the truth no i'm a murderer what is he going to make me yeah well bless god i'm standing for the truth no you see church where we could be we except right here in lula georgia and how the mark of the beast because it's in our forehead and our hand it's in our knowledge it says on their forehead or in the forehead what's in your forehead your intelligence your knowledge is the front part of your brain situation go look it up you know and it's that knowledge that you have why does people get upset with you when you try to tell them the truth you know i mean why but remember now let's just get that scripture up go number 10 and let's read that in revelation 13 16. because remember the scripture's got the answer and he calls us all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand are in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had to mark listen or the name of the beast now you're getting the point of here it talks about in their foreheads all right now he's saying what that no man might by ourselves say he that had the mark now where's the mark and what is it or the name of the beast the name of the beast well what do you mean it's beast does it say over on one of the church ages said you've got a name that you're living but you're dead why is it that everybody that you talk to now you you're going to say this right at least ninety percent of whatever you start talking i'm methodist i'm baptist i'm presbyterian is it not in the scripture where jesus was there in the gospels talking about how that they'll say let us take your name to take away our reproach you know approach for a woman to have a baby without having a husband that's a pretty good reproach and of course nowadays it's kind of accepted but we're not talking about that we're talking about christianity but what about these women are wanting the name of god and what would be the name of god in that age or that time or that period it wouldn't be jesus or even if it wasn't had the wrong idea about it where would it work see there's a name goes with this beast a name goes with it why because his name goes with christianity jesus so then what is his name or the number of his name now the number of his name what is the number of his name see here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 603 and six now that's his name that's his name what hundred and sixty-six well now now brother dale we we we know better than that you know well to save reading a whole lot you know the story that brother branham gave and he said 666 and they asked him a question about it and he said i've been there and seen it said over the pope and rome is written vicarius philia idea and it says instead of god he said in every pope that ever was there or whatever is saying there instead of god now that's a quote if you want all right but he said break that down in roman numerals and said what would it be now i want you to hold on to something and then we'll pull up the 666 you know just show it but remember you got the name of the beast and the number of his name so there's going to be a connection between the name and the number my name may figure out to be 666. yours might do it too but remember as we'll get to the rest of the scriptures we don't sit on seven hills and rule the world and if i don't get to it he said cincinnati sits on seven hills but he said it has no control control of anything religiously he said that's only two places he knew of was rome hitler in cincinnati ohio all right but remember the number of the beasts and i know you've done this but we'll show it to the to the internet system so go ahead brother joe and pull that up and see that vicarious philly idea means instead of god all right so here he's got it simply made out v is one i i mean v is five eyes one c is a hundred all right get back on your a's you you leave out some of that you have to go through all of that to understand it but you come back to the v and the five and you come back to i and the l and some of the letters is not counted because that's in the way they figure but it figures out to be 666. and over it is instead of the son of god like i said you can say well brother dale your name sure my name might be 666 if you want to figure it out but this person has got to be in control and the world has to come to his feet he can't buy or sell unless you got it you say well brother then what is these credit cards well that's might be part of it social security numbers that might be part of it there's going to be controlling systems there's going to be all kind of doings but the prophet of god said to this save time of reading he said that what it was was the trinitarian doctrine jump over to number 15 brother anderson the trinitarian doctrine why because it's in your forehead it's in your intelligence it's in your brain you know it's in your thinking we've been we've had it sung to us all our life until it's just normal well praise father son and holy god and we've heard it so much until this god in three persons june's mom one day and i'm throwing off an owner just like everybody else she just said it she said sound don't believe in the holy trinity well she was just saying what everybody i say it you know but go back with me of what i've tried to say at the beginning what happened to cain unbelief took over right he killed his brother a display of that unbelief an attribute he goes before god instead of in a repentant attitude and said lord i'm sorry i know i killed him or not i killed him no instead of that he's saying am i my brother's keeper in other words you you blaming me for what happened and if you probably listen to the whole story and say i said something to abel wouldn't that wouldn't that be about today you know i mean today nobody's guilty i mean they got 49 pictures of a guy blowing a man's brains out with a shotgun and his name tag on his shirt i'm not guilty you know well is that the way we are about the religious matters probably if you listen to cain you know and really what he was saying was before god he said what are you doing blaming me for it he rose up first he just wasn't there to watch it he rose up first i just killed him out of self-defense you see that's silly that's what i'm trying to make it as silly as i can because that's where we come to in ourselves well brother dale i've been in the message all of my life praise god but how long has the message been in you amen i was born and raised in this message praise god but how much of the message is in you and i right but look what he says here now we won't stay up on the top we'll run way down to the bottom because it'll save time the reading drop so run it up until we get what's marked you know all right he's talking about imperial rome and the different things of christianity but the main thing i want to come down to is this may seem far-fetched to some but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great is that control this economical move will end up with rome at the head even though the people did not envision that in vision it that way this is so because in rome in revelation 17 3-6 it is stated that the mr babylon is seated on on the beast and she is controlling the lies their fourth empowered this roman church is doing that with the world church's system under her rome will con will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to rome because rome controls the gold of the world thus all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in their head or forehead or head now you say well brother dale oh we've got it on down here so don't worry about it we'll read it where he says it ain't all here yet okay so don't jump real quick with me we're not in the stages of where they're persecuting us to death come on but listen to him this mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system which is trinitarianism and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the world church all right with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching and so forth her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb no we don't go through the persecution we don't i mean don't go through the tribulation no we don't but what is the mark of the beast and where is it at the mark of the beast is in your forehead your intelligence your thinking and see why it's so hard to preach is because of what we've been taught i don't care where you ever went in the door of a church where you ever went and joined a church or went to a church if the prophet's right and the bible's right you either got the mark of the beast or the seal of god all right it don't matter where you ever went to a church you've got the same doctrine now i know this is going out on airways and people probably hear it and one of these days can use it but still it's the truth what's the difference in trinitarianism of the catholic church or trinitarianism of the baptist church methodist or whatever you know presbyterians pentecostals whatever lula eyes right what's the difference all right but now if you believe in trinitarianism means you're going to believe in many gods right coming from rome that had many gods well then you tell me that buddha hinduism islamics all of that is not in a trinitarian form many god's doctrine picaise said over there in india they had what was it three million gods and goddesses you know so the whole world now listen you catch what i'm saying about the mark of the beast then the whole world is in a trinitarian doctrine it don't matter whether they're muslim or whatever anything contrary to the truly revealed word is antichrist right we're not throwing off on people people are people we're people but the doctrine we love our families and things nobody hates their family i'm not i've said that over a while ago and the message you know we love our people we want to help them and do the best we can but if they don't want the truth what can we do we can't make them believe it but we can pray for them and just remember they've been taught that all of their life we've been taught all of our life as their right hand right we've been talk 12 inches a foot whose foot horses measured by hands whose hands i'd hate to try to get on a horse that was if it was 14 hands for i'm just getting it for a normal horse you know 14 hours i'd sure hate to try to get on a horse that brother our line measured that man had hands like that one hand on him would be two for mine see it's what we've been taught all of our lives we've been taught that it's got to be three gods he said yeah but now we've heard the message well how many in the message is preaching the truth of one god come on i'm not against nobody love everybody but the truth will separate us right but now i said i wanted to get that part out of the way about the mark of the beast it's unbelief to disbelieve god's word we're already marked see the truth will set you free all right but now listen the amazing part is what i've tried to explain to you god has to come through the same place because the greatest battle ever fought is fought in the mind of mankind right not fault in your heart or just it's fault in your brain but see satan comes in that brain but god has to use the same brain now you you believe what the prophet would say that if we're sealed in satan sealed out you agree with that if we're sealed in by the holy ghost satan's sealed out right because that's what the seal is all right but what about us being sealed no brother dale i got the holy ghost 40 years ago blessed god you can't tell me i ain't sealed amen if you were sealed but if you wouldn't seal then that's the problem that's you got the trouble lying you reject the word don't you can't tell me the seal of god is dark god can't deny his own word so then where are we but what i want us to think about is not just the mark of the beast because come on we know the mark of the beast is unbelief it's not a stamp it's not a something like that it's the doctrines that have been talked to you and i that we swear by it come on may i quote brother branham he said i used to carry a baptist bible that's what he said and convert them to a baptist faith now you need that quote no not really random i was listening to him yesterday come find out wade was over on the other side reading anointing once the end time and i've been listening to it two days in a row and uh that anointing is the same you know it's not different from this person to that person the anointing of the holy ghost is the same it's whether or not you're born again is the difference if you're born again you're sealed in and satan is sealed out but what about the scripture there where it talks about being born again in other words after you're born again you're being born again you're being sealed in that's that's the point to me now watch what i'm getting at remember the name the mark it's a name it's a doctrine it's what somebody taught but god can only use the word as it's being taught that's the only way you can do that's why it's so important to hear the word for word that you and i can have an opportunity i at least want you to have an opportunity to be able to be saved i can't save you i wish i could we can't can't save my family my wife or whatever no but i want them to have an opportunity to at least hear the truth yes you know would you think you're the only one got it i didn't say that why are you saying it but think about now the mark of the beast and remember it's in your forehead and remember it's the number of a name all right and watch what we're getting to now let's go to revelations 20 and 14 number 16. we'll try to get through and i saw thrones they that set upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus christ and for the word of god which had not worshiped the beast neither his image now who is this who is this the bride right do you need any more because you you want to end up right down here see if you doubt that being the bride because look at it which had not which did had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years now that's the bride right now watch what she's doing she didn't receive his mark so she has don't have to worry about the works and the hands and things because she's not sealed by his doctrine she's not sealed away or marked she's going to rule and reign for him for a thousand years now watch the rest of it go on to the next we just got through reading this when we read verse 16. and cause all both small and great poor rich and poor to receive a mark in their right hand are in their foreheads now we've tried to cover that that mark is not a stamper etc it's a doctrine right it's what you believe cain believed his mama's doctrine and that's what put him out of the garden right cain believed it was blood abel believed it was fruit and he was put out because of the fact of what he believed now you know he's sealed away from god maybe i'll swap the names on that you put it where it's supposed to be okay but think about it go to revelations 14 1 and let's read something and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sign and with him 144 thousand having his father's name written in their four heads now written in their foreheads that's not a mark of the beast right right that 144 000 receive the holy ghost here right am i right now where the prophet's message come on but having his father's name remember the other guy's what his name the number of his name and right now you got it having his father's name written in their foreheads it's in their knowledge right all right let's go to ezekiel 9 and 4. and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city to the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sign cry for the abomination that be done in the midst thereof set a mark on them remember the mark of the beast is your intelligence and it's your trinitarian doctrine so remember the truth would be what the name of jesus and the revealed word right go on to 7 4 and let's read 7 3 and 4 saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads oh that's 144 000 brother dale you don't understand that they're sealed in their foreheads we're still in our heart go to sleep and i heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed 144 thousand sealed in your forehead the holy spirit's been doing something down through time that mankind never understood this prophet came with it and started bringing it to us and it's showing us the truth the new the new birth is the seal of god in your soul we believe that we believe 144 000 will receive that also all right but it won't make them bride but it does still make them they're going to be in the millennium what your prophet says but what about being sealed in our forehead now you can't start unless you seal in your soul first so don't even worry about it you know okay because you're already marked by the mark of the beast all right so think about it now let's just read a few quotes in a hurry look at number 21 resort results of decision preaching 56 1008 e38 and i said the sabbath is the holy ghost you remember he's talking to a seventh-day adventist guy he said nonsense the sabbath is a day i said it was at one time limited to a certain people but today the sabbath is the baptism of the holy ghost that's right he said oh it can't be why he said god gave the day and sealed it with a memorial that it was a day keeping what i said for our people but today ephesians 4 30 said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed until still till the day of your redemption see no day right holy ghost is the seal of god that'll be upon the forehead watch him or the knowledge in the hand what's in the hand the works of every person that's took him to the kingdom of god will be baptized with the holy ghost seal of god in this last days is a distinction a mark that will be put up on the people which we had about a week's revival on it put on the forehead on your knowledge look at the next one the oneness of unity preached in 1956 58 128 page 19. he says your prophet is taught your pastors have taught you but then he's getting down to what what's the seal of god brother branham the holy ghost you say is that scriptural absolutely many of them let me just give you one so you won't forget it ephesians 4 30 said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed till the day of your redemption there is the seal of god that's what i'm trying to tell you you've looked for the seal of god to come in the last days not on your forehead and watch him sounds like he's turning away but watch it saying it was on your forehead is your knowledge to understand but the bible said the seal of god is the baptism of the holy ghost and everybody that has it their hearts are free they're sealed by the knowledge of god in their forehead that they'll do that they do know that jesus is dead and raised again because they can see him that's what you're sealed with right look at the next one united under one headship 1958 326 e34 and what happened you can't stand neutral you got to be filled with something to survive notice you might be filled with one thing over another you say brother branham i'm kind of on the fence no you're not the bible plainly says that all that was not sealed with the holy ghost received the mark of the beast all that didn't have the seal of god in their forehead had the mark of the beast he doesn't have any problem talking about the forehead does he come on so all that didn't have the seal of god in their foreheads had to mark the beast you got to be one of it now i'd like to like to test it just a little bit and see where you're standing them the mark of the beast remember is a religious mark certainly it is and you're you might be filled with religion you can have all kind of religion that doesn't save you at all you can just be a religious fanatic if you want to touch not taste not handle not smell not that don't have one thing to do with the holy spirit holy ghost okay look at the next one i have two more will three this is taken from the ten virgins 144 thousand nineteen sixty twelve eleven paragraph 250 all right we all know that the seal of god is the holy spirit now that's found you take revelations 9 9 1 to 4. you'll find that they all that had to seal in their forehead first corinthians 1 22 paul said whereby he seals us by his holy spirit until the day of redemption ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit and that's the angel that comes forth sealing upon their forehead now that doesn't mean and you think put a spot up there your forehead is your revelation see and your hand is the thing you do about it it's a spiritual mark so you don't take a big stamp and stamp you like that oh no it sounds like he's talking about the mark of the beast doesn't it but he's not he's just told you what he's talking about the seal of god in your revelation all right one more ordination 1962 1104 in the evening's earth and remember this morning's lesson these virtues has to be in there before the capstone will ever come on it oh you might shout you might sing you might speak with tongues and dance it has nothing at all to do with it until these things scripturally proven and sealed into you the holy spirit seals you in as an individual than your son and daughter all right read adoption we could come and bring all of it but you ought to know it brother random on the statue i've got it in here when i won't read this blasphemous name he says you're sealed into this you're sealed into this you're sealed into this but but brother dale i thought i sealed with the baptism in the holy ghost that's right and then when virtue comes on that it's sealed in when knowledge comes on it it's sealed in so we're being born again we're being sealed and the lies that comes the reason i read that is what the capstone the capstone comes and seals the individual just like the ages he seals your word in your forehead right what is the headstone sealed into these things each one sealing us in until the holy ghost comes himself the headstone of it all jesus christ has sealed us into the kingdom read blasphemous names if you need a lot to understand sealed in your forehead but brother dale i thought we were sealed in our heart our soul well that's right but god's been doing something he's sealing in his people then you've got adoption you've got the head seal the headstone all of those messages adoptions and all of the things that he went through hear ye him all of the things statue of a perfect man sealing us in our forehead we read where the prophet said that's your knowledge he said that's your revelation see we're not sealed just because we're good people we're sealed because of the holy spirit that is teaching us the word and as i said while ago then we believe in when we're sealed in he's sealed out right now i want to ask you a simple question what do you think we've been around here 40-something years since the prophet was gone and he had 30-something years preaching it but what's going to bring the rapture you know the change well one of these days california is going under that don't brian amen done proved it to you we can be here after california goes under well i didn't believe that well it's all right but you realize what's happening to you and i as the word is being revealed to us a revelation is what i'm talking about see a revelation seals you in but it also seals the devil out what do you think is going to bring a rapture i've always tried to preach the statue of a perfect man maybe a little different than what a lot of people thinks about it because i had a good teacher remote 1971 it took him months to preach it but i asked him a simple question when he got through i said brother mo i believe every bit what you said i want to know how to get them virtuous because i know we got to have them it's in the statue of prayer event richard said the first time he seen it brother and i said this is a requirement why is it the rapture hasn't come it's because the people won't stand still long enough for god to see them but you're sealed by revelation right i thought the holy ghost was a revelation a new birth and that means you're sealed in but we're coming up the statue of a perfect man talking about that to bring us out to where the prophet said this what is it black feminist name urgent no yeah i'm pretty sure he said her stature perfect and blasphemous 91 he said this is the church that will be brought up through the ages to go into the rapture he said this is the individual that will be brought up through these things what do you think i've screamed and hollered and tried my best to just preach to you because you're only sealed by the word if you want to go through a lot of things and think about it go in and think about it the antichrist has a name he has a mark he has a seal the holy ghost has a mark he has a name and he has a seal his name is jesus we're sealed in by the revelation and as we're being sealed in satan's being sealed out well brother dale it don't look like it i want to know when you ever got that idea or where'd you get it from well i just don't see it well evidently you ain't got it because if you had it you would see it right come on see i don't mind talking like that i ain't gaining no friends or losing none because don't have none i'm not worried about it but is he sealing us in sister gail he's sealing satan out we just don't realize what's taking place because it's being so quiet and simple right around said god draws billions of gallons of water out of the ocean every day and takes them up and said not one sound but you see like brother claude was bringing sunday when the time comes you're going to see who sealed him and who's sealed out that's why i preached to you many many years ago i said a lot of people in this message and maybe i'm one of them will not be able to stand there and take that change so they're going to go by the grave we've seen a lot of that young and old i'm not decreasing anybody only those who know their god will be able to stand there and know that they're sealed in now satan could hinder jesus right no problem right he could hinder him and cause a lot of problems right but don't you believe he was sealed in and satan couldn't get to him unless god allowed it and he just said no satan's coming that ain't got nothing in me well you know what i wish i could say that i see a revelation is a very simple thing is god's revealed truth to you and i about himself that adoption is not god going off the scene and you and i coming on the scene that's what i've heard ever since i've been in the message it's not that away it's you and i going off the scene and god coming on the scene in you and i that's right as we yield ourself what about a prophet could make this statement he said i laid so close to god until i forced the gift to operate you want the quote what about a man that could lay so close to god you see church we've been sealed right now in our foreheads by our revelation because it's sealing those virtues into us by the opening of the word so the mark of the beast sure we all had that but then we start by the new birth and you know what the old mark of the beast is still working up through the head right come on everybody didn't get brother brown's message right but he said did he say they weren't born again come on no he said they had the new birth it only meant for a special people to catch that word and to believe it and walk into it until he can seal out satan every time he reveals something to me brother gary it sealed that old devil out of me it's just got to keep climbing you mean they could come now and convince you there's a trinity you know what they call that what's that word deprogram you you mean they could take you in right now and deprogram you well it means you didn't have it because the seal of god can't be de-programmed think on these things come ahead musicians think on these things the seal of god coming forth in our forehead as we receive the word what did the prophet say we become the word when the little bride is sealed in satan's sealed out when he's sealed out rapture can come back on these things let's stand think on these things and just let's see what do we got brother i love you yeah go ahead somebody help us sing it because we don't we can get it started maybe we can find it um voice you see why i raised my hands with that sign don't you that sign of i love you i love him don't you even if he sent us to hell we should be a happy people for god to reveal itself to us i love you and i lift anybody have a need may it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear amen sister monica how's your mother doing we're going to keep praying we're going to believe it we're going to doubt our doubts and believe the word right shut up oh my soul reach out take joy my king rachel how's your grandmother doing he's better we're going to keep believing and we're going to doubt our doubts if we have to and believe him and say thank you lord just reveal yourself unto us lord make known we're not looking for great mysteries if you're doing that then there's something wrong with you he's looking for god to reveal himself unto you and i and he promised it to his children right he promised his children he'd reveal the word what are we doing then like me i was lost but now i'm i was blind but now i see it was grace that tall right my heart think about him like what he's done for you and i no matter how sick we are or whatever we should have that praise in our heart and say love lord i love you i love you lord standing on a deer stand one day and a great things happen at this great hurt and all in around my heart just pain and running down my arms i said lord if this is the end of it then fine i'm higher up than a wood beef i was on the ground what to say i said at least i'm up off the ground so if it's a heart attack or whatever it is i just said i am i said i'll just sit here you didn't get excited brother dale no what good would it have done off in the woods by myself what god would have done i just sat down said thank you lord i love you a little bit the pain just started easing away i said well lord thank you right your destiny is remember the service is sunday pray one for another remember saturday now you'll go with us to the fellowship meeting win the battle so so you
