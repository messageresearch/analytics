[8:37] remember and pray for that the lord
[8:38] would bless him maybe we'll know pretty
[8:40] quick
[8:41] all right remember anna she's real sick
[8:44] with sinuses i called her and talked to
[8:46] her
[8:46] and the doctor gave her
[8:48] i think she said three shots and a whole
[8:50] bunch of stuff so it must have been
[8:52] in bad right
[8:54] and then two now
[8:57] you know we'll talk about mother's day
[8:58] this coming sunday
[9:01] will be mother's day
[9:02] all right in case y'all were all
[9:04] wondering about
[9:06] getting a mother's day but it will be
[9:08] this coming sunday
[9:10] and i will say it this way and no more
[9:14] uh there might be some surprises to you
[9:17] sisters
[9:20] this coming mother's day
[9:24] might be a surprise
[9:28] so you know the brothers there always
[9:30] get together at father's day and we go
[9:32] for a fishing trip and we have a good
[9:34] time but
[9:35] you know might be a surprise okay
[9:38] all right let's see all the
[9:39] announcements
[9:41] first thessalonians i was sitting there
[9:43] thinking while ago and
[9:44] and brother uh dale roberts came on my
[9:47] mind
[9:48] and uh you know they view us on the
[9:50] internet
[9:52] and uh
[9:53] i thought brother dale's sitting there
[9:55] this this afternoon grinning saying
[9:58] what is he gonna come up with next
[10:02] so
[10:02] brother dale hang on
[10:05] we might come up with something
[10:07] all right but
[10:09] you know i'm sure the internet people
[10:11] they get a kick out of it we
[10:13] which one sister used to say you know
[10:15] uh no brother dale in his ways of
[10:18] doing but uh
[10:20] i'm not quite as well known yet as
[10:22] brother forney of the wowzy wowzy woo
[10:26] you know that's that's his way of
[10:27] bringing it okay but remember these
[10:30] things pray one for another prayer the
[10:31] lord would open our understanding
[10:33] because that's our desire right first
[10:36] thessalonians 4.
[10:38] heavenly father we thank you for your
[10:40] love and your grace and your guidance
[10:42] and thank you for you lord and we just
[10:45] pray that you would just bless each
[10:46] other and everyone
[10:48] bless us here in the service lord and
[10:49] bless those who would view the services
[10:52] out there and we pray that there'd be
[10:54] some way that we could help someone
[10:55] because that's all the desire we have in
[10:58] our heart
[10:59] is to try to be a help we know we have
[11:01] an odd way of being and very
[11:04] um maybe an unusual way of being a human
[11:07] being and speaking but there's one thing
[11:10] about it the people who here know that
[11:12] we're not trying to pull something over
[11:13] on them not trying to deceive nobody but
[11:16] just trying to be honest and straight
[11:18] and lord the main thing is to try to
[11:20] serve you
[11:21] and to bring what you want us to hear
[11:24] because we believe you forgive our sins
[11:26] lead us now as we read your word you
[11:28] come and speak to our hearts
[11:30] in jesus name
[11:32] amen
[11:34] first thessalonians
[11:36] 4
[11:40] for if we believe that jesus died and
[11:43] rose again
[11:45] even so them also which sleep in jesus
[11:49] will god bring with him remember now
[11:51] what we're saying this morning
[11:54] the resurrection's got to come
[11:57] everybody wants to talk about a rapture
[12:00] that's fine
[12:01] but remember there's got to be a
[12:03] resurrection
[12:05] before there's a rapture
[12:08] that's the order
[12:09] of the events it's got to happen that
[12:11] away all right
[12:14] for this we say unto you by the word of
[12:16] the lord that we which are alive and
[12:18] remain unto the coming of the lord
[12:20] shall not hinder us he won't prevent
[12:22] them which are asleep because they're
[12:24] waiting on us
[12:26] all right
[12:27] for the lord himself shall descend from
[12:29] heaven with a shout
[12:31] with the voice of the archangel and with
[12:33] the trump of god and the dead in christ
[12:35] shall rise first now remember this
[12:37] morning we kept putting our emphasis
[12:39] upon present tense
[12:42] remember paul is prophesying
[12:45] from back there
[12:48] but if paul was here today
[12:50] he wouldn't say for the lord himself
[12:52] shall descend
[12:56] he would be saying the lord has
[12:57] descended
[12:59] all right now remember that for the lord
[13:02] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[13:03] shout the divorce of the archangel and
[13:05] with the trump of god
[13:07] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[13:10] then we which are alive and remain shall
[13:11] be caught up together
[13:13] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[13:15] in the iron so shall we ever be with the
[13:19] lord you may be seated the lord add his
[13:21] blessing
[13:22] to the reading of the word
[13:26] i said i wasn't going to announce it but
[13:28] we did change the temperature all right
[13:32] it was running 69 and everybody says
[13:34] they were freezing to death
[13:37] we've run it up to 71.
[13:39] now you're gonna have to fuss with the
[13:41] ones that
[13:42] are hot
[13:43] so
[13:46] what can we do i threatened to buy
[13:48] everybody a little bitty suit
[13:51] to put on
[13:52] with a little temperature control inside
[13:54] that you could go
[13:56] you know
[13:58] we can't do it so we've been running it
[14:00] at 69 that wasn't too cold what we think
[14:03] but
[14:04] everybody was freezing so now we're
[14:06] going to run it on 71 see what you think
[14:08] about it for a while
[14:10] and all and that you fan
[14:12] uh and new things but
[14:14] you know we we try
[14:16] we we can't have everything
[14:19] in our own way
[14:21] uh
[14:22] you know
[14:26] maybe that's one of them things that i
[14:28] say or do to get people to leave
[14:34] i'm just
[14:35] look i kid i don't want nobody to leave
[14:38] i never have
[14:39] i want everybody
[14:41] if we had to build a
[14:43] 500 capacity
[14:45] place to do we do
[14:47] but my point is if it's some silliness
[14:50] that you've got against me because i
[14:52] don't paint part my hair just right or
[14:56] or some comical thing i say
[14:59] and you want to leave well then you need
[15:00] to leave
[15:02] that's as plain as i can be that's not
[15:04] being
[15:05] hateful or nothing it's just being right
[15:08] all right
[15:09] but let's think about it now
[15:11] review just a second
[15:14] remember what we covered this morning
[15:16] from psalms 27
[15:19] that the prophet seemingly used a very
[15:21] odd scripture
[15:23] to be talking of the
[15:27] rapture
[15:28] or the catching away
[15:30] and in those scriptures there was no uh
[15:33] really emphasis light upon
[15:37] the uh point of being caught away you
[15:39] know going up or anything
[15:42] it was seemingly that he was speaking of
[15:44] things
[15:45] you know through
[15:46] the psalmist back dire that was present
[15:49] tense to him that's supposed to be
[15:51] present tense with us it's like i said
[15:54] paul if paul was here today he wouldn't
[15:57] say the lord himself shall descend from
[15:59] heaven with a shout
[16:01] he'd say wake up folks you've already
[16:04] had to shout
[16:07] the voice of the archangel
[16:09] is the lord jesus christ
[16:12] and the trumpet
[16:13] is when we will go away
[16:15] see you know
[16:17] but
[16:18] i emphasize a lot of things that i like
[16:21] for you to think about
[16:23] and then you'll see what i believe about
[16:24] a fifo ministry
[16:26] how that's their job is to break down
[16:28] things to get us to see it
[16:30] but really i would like for you to take
[16:33] the rapture message
[16:36] and sit down and explain some of the
[16:38] things brother branham taught
[16:44] he taught about a voice of an arcane i
[16:46] was talking about a
[16:47] shout voice of an archangel and trumpet
[16:51] but
[16:53] can you really read that to see what
[16:56] those things are
[17:02] because some of the things seemingly are
[17:07] past tense present tense future tense
[17:11] you know
[17:13] but seemingly that he's trying his best
[17:15] to get us to look at what's taking place
[17:17] now
[17:18] a prophet is not to bring you
[17:21] if it's a prophecy paul was speaking
[17:24] there in a prophecy of a future event
[17:28] right but to paul he saw
[17:31] that
[17:32] present tense
[17:34] we were talking about it last night
[17:36] about moses writing the book of genesis
[17:39] well you know what i believe moses saw
[17:43] he saw the literal things that took
[17:45] place in the garden of eden
[17:49] you know
[17:51] the literal act the literal beasts the
[17:53] literal things the literal changing
[17:57] from the the
[17:58] beasts to the serpent you know
[18:01] i believe he saw that
[18:03] i believe naaman saw chariots jostling
[18:06] in the streets
[18:08] running like lightning you know
[18:11] talking about torches and things but he
[18:14] was really looking down and seeing
[18:15] buicks and oldsmobile or something out
[18:17] on the highway running together with the
[18:19] headlights on
[18:21] well see moses when he said that but
[18:23] then when he started to put it into
[18:26] wording
[18:28] it would be the holy spirit would direct
[18:30] his wording
[18:33] as to hide it from the wise and prudent
[18:38] because we read now the genesis account
[18:41] right
[18:43] you know
[18:44] the believers of the message
[18:46] that really believed right around was a
[18:47] prophet and explained we read the
[18:49] genesis account and we don't see apples
[18:51] on a tree
[18:56] right
[18:57] we don't look at just that that we call
[18:59] silliness that other people looks at you
[19:02] know
[19:03] we say we know what happened
[19:07] but it's still written
[19:09] in a way
[19:10] that would hide it
[19:15] but yet they saw it
[19:17] ezekiel saw
[19:18] fire falling down out of the sky
[19:22] and what was he describing
[19:24] nuclear destructions the prophet said
[19:29] he saw
[19:30] uh
[19:33] like
[19:34] horses and and things you know running
[19:37] you know the prophet said he saw israel
[19:39] in journey
[19:42] all right
[19:43] see when a prophet sees something he
[19:45] sees what he sees
[19:47] but he cannot express that
[19:50] as he sees it if he did there wouldn't
[19:52] be no mystery to the word of god
[19:56] so i'm just asking you to read the
[19:58] rapture message and then just sit down
[20:00] and think about
[20:02] well do i really get a sensible
[20:04] understanding
[20:07] do i really get a
[20:09] well the prophet said it
[20:14] well all right it's wonderful
[20:16] but do we see it
[20:18] by revelation we'll get to that in a
[20:20] minute all right
[20:22] but you see in psalms there
[20:26] he used those scriptures it brings
[20:28] everything to a present tense
[20:31] because listen if you and i don't see
[20:34] this message
[20:35] coming to a present tense form to you
[20:38] and i personal
[20:41] then we're a moses at a burning bush
[20:43] asking for god to give us something else
[20:45] because we don't understand what's going
[20:47] on
[20:49] you remember what i said this morning
[20:50] moses said i'm not going when you tell
[20:52] me you're the god of abraham isaac and
[20:53] jacob i want something personal right
[20:57] that was to abraham that was to isaac
[20:59] that was to jacob i want a personal
[21:03] revelation
[21:04] don't you
[21:06] something that i can walk on martin
[21:08] luther
[21:10] challenged the whole world over the just
[21:13] shall live by faith
[21:15] once god revealed that to him
[21:20] until then it wasn't now you go out with
[21:23] a a carnal concept
[21:26] i've heard people explain justification
[21:29] and i thought
[21:31] that wouldn't what happened to me
[21:37] you know
[21:38] i've heard people play explain
[21:40] sanctification
[21:42] you know
[21:43] well i quit this and i quit that
[21:48] well
[21:49] i never did drink
[21:53] did that mean i was always saved
[21:56] you know
[21:57] if sanctification all you know about it
[22:00] is quitting things
[22:03] i thought it was a work of the holy
[22:05] spirit
[22:07] i thought that was the words of the
[22:08] prophet
[22:09] the justification is a work of the holy
[22:11] spirit sanctification is a work of the
[22:13] holy spirit
[22:15] but the baptism is the holy spirit
[22:17] but you know what
[22:20] john wesley taught sanctification as the
[22:23] baptism of the holy spirit you know what
[22:25] in that day it was
[22:29] in luther's day justification was the
[22:31] baptism of the holy ghost of that age
[22:33] because the holy ghost in every age
[22:36] it's not one age with the holy ghost
[22:38] another way not a holy ghost
[22:40] you're changing your god in your ways
[22:45] i'm trying to say to you and i we need
[22:48] something personal
[22:53] how many of you have ever been healed
[22:55] i'm not talking about just delivered
[22:57] over a period of time i'm talking about
[22:59] this something miraculous happened and
[23:01] you were healed
[23:07] you know
[23:08] one minute you didn't have it
[23:11] the next minute you stood there with it
[23:13] and you didn't matter what anybody else
[23:15] said
[23:18] that doctor told me to take my kneecaps
[23:20] off about 30 years ago he'd take one of
[23:22] my kneecaps off
[23:25] i looked at him with a life i said you
[23:26] won't do it he looked back in life he
[23:28] said i'll you'll be back in here
[23:30] well i still got my kneecaps
[23:34] see because i was speaking from
[23:35] something that was real
[23:38] i was not speaking from a uh well i hope
[23:41] i'm healed maybe i'm healed over but the
[23:43] prophet said i'm healed
[23:45] is that what everybody wants
[23:49] something like that
[23:51] i want something personal
[23:55] a god of william branham is fine for
[23:57] william branham
[24:00] but elisha when he said were be the god
[24:02] of elijah was not a questioning
[24:06] it was a simple statement
[24:08] it wasn't questioning where be it was a
[24:10] simple statement that if
[24:12] i come over with elijah he smote it we
[24:15] walked across on dry ground i smiled it
[24:17] we walked back across the same god
[24:21] right
[24:22] he had something personal amen
[24:26] brother branham preached the seals in
[24:29] 1957 i believe that's right now you
[24:32] remember he preached to me he took like
[24:35] not one night he took a whole bunch now
[24:38] but you know what one day
[24:41] those seals was broke
[24:45] and he preached it
[24:47] because it's something personal
[24:49] you remember the quote we were ending
[24:51] with this morning where he said have we
[24:53] heard the voice of god
[24:55] speaking to us through the opening of
[24:57] these
[24:58] seals well they broke the bread around
[25:01] them they broke the bread well that's
[25:02] wonderful
[25:04] if they hadn't broke him you and i
[25:05] wouldn't have it
[25:08] but does that make you have it because
[25:10] you can read it
[25:13] come on
[25:14] the prophet had a revelation i got a
[25:16] revelation he had a revelation
[25:19] the bible always said
[25:22] in matthew 28
[25:24] to baptize in the name of the father
[25:27] and her son in the holy ghost
[25:32] we went on over in acts and said to
[25:33] baptize the name of
[25:35] jesus christ
[25:38] we was reading the bible
[25:42] see one day that came alive right
[25:46] and you said wait a minute
[25:48] this can't be contrary one to the other
[25:53] right
[25:55] see something coming live in her heart
[25:59] all right you see him in the message
[26:01] claiming brother branham was a prophet
[26:03] fathered it for 40 years
[26:07] now they're trying to show how wrong he
[26:08] was
[26:12] now that ain't even sensible
[26:16] i mean you follow something 40 years and
[26:18] then you turn around try to prove how
[26:20] wrong the man was
[26:25] you understand i'm talking about
[26:27] something personal
[26:29] is god real to you or is he just a
[26:31] concept or a thought
[26:33] or a quote
[26:40] can you put
[26:41] into plain language what you believe
[26:46] i asked a question last night that i've
[26:48] always asked
[26:50] could god take your
[26:53] revelation
[26:54] of one god
[26:56] to israel
[27:02] if you can't your revelation is wrong
[27:07] i don't care how many quotes you guys or
[27:10] what you're talking about
[27:12] if he couldn't take what this bride
[27:14] believes and go to israel that we know
[27:18] he will take what we believe and go to
[27:20] israel not us
[27:23] he'll take this message
[27:26] which is the entire bible
[27:29] and he'll carry it to israel
[27:32] they won't get over there and quote the
[27:33] seals the plagues of ours
[27:35] they'll put it personal
[27:39] from their own revelation
[27:42] but they'll explain to them jews go into
[27:44] the seventh seal and read it they'll
[27:46] explain to them jews you missed it
[27:49] you had to write for sonship and you
[27:52] turned it down
[27:53] now you're in the tribulation because of
[27:55] that rejection
[28:01] but you know what it'll be then it'll be
[28:02] something real
[28:04] it'll be so real to them jews 144
[28:07] thousand you know what they say
[28:10] what about something so real they say
[28:12] where did you get the nail prints
[28:15] right now is jesus standing there
[28:17] physically no
[28:22] come on
[28:23] your prophet said he don't set his foot
[28:25] on the ground until the millennium
[28:28] all right
[28:30] but he's so much through those two
[28:32] witnesses
[28:38] but wouldn't it be something to take a
[28:40] two lord
[28:41] or a two soul doctrine
[28:43] are these river jordans now that jesus
[28:45] wasn't god to the river jordan
[28:47] you don't never listen to brother
[28:48] branham as i tell them last night
[28:52] brother randall said don't you tell them
[28:54] jews about that trinity he said they'll
[28:56] tell you where it come from
[28:58] you know why they studied it
[29:01] we were in israel the god that was there
[29:04] to us reuben
[29:05] said on our death in school
[29:09] is a bible
[29:12] and we teach
[29:14] our children about the jesus you talk
[29:17] about
[29:20] isn't that something
[29:21] you put a bible on the desk in america
[29:23] and they'll lock you up
[29:30] you see where we've gone to be the
[29:32] heathen
[29:35] and what we're doing
[29:38] forgive me because that just tires me
[29:39] out
[29:40] to think about
[29:42] you and i as human beings and what we've
[29:45] done
[29:46] with the greatest message
[29:48] that has ever been told
[29:50] the complete plan of redemption
[29:53] and the silliness of mankind and what
[29:55] has happened to it
[29:57] well you can't trust the prophet because
[29:59] he says this and then he says that
[30:02] and he said which one's right
[30:06] i say leave it alone you'll find out
[30:08] it'll come together
[30:11] if it didn't he corrected it if it then
[30:14] you ever noticed this quote
[30:17] he said a prophet stands before no one
[30:21] god alone
[30:25] so what'd he say
[30:28] he said leave it alone if you don't
[30:30] understand
[30:32] he said say what i said
[30:34] he said cause i'll be responsible
[30:37] i know i'm as carnal as an old shoe but
[30:40] if somebody could only hear up to 62
[30:44] with a message
[30:46] and you're brought around them
[30:47] explaining
[30:48] the things
[30:50] they would not be responsible for what
[30:52] he taught later on
[30:54] and you know what
[30:56] they could say the white horse rider
[30:59] is the holy ghost
[31:01] because that's what your prophet said
[31:04] right
[31:08] so it would be on him
[31:13] and nobody can
[31:16] nobody can argue with the prophet
[31:19] who's the dumb idiot would trot
[31:24] heard a man one time said
[31:25] me and bill decided i thought boy
[31:31] me and bill decided
[31:37] do not forgive me
[31:39] but think about it
[31:43] a prophet tries to always
[31:46] get people to see things present tense
[31:52] all right
[31:53] and that's what we should do
[31:58] what good is the god of yesterday
[32:04] well if we never find out where he's at
[32:06] we'll get to him no
[32:08] he's been here all the time
[32:13] but listen
[32:15] he used the scriptures in psalms
[32:18] that would be speaking of present tense
[32:21] and speaks of a rapture
[32:25] then he comes along from that and that's
[32:28] where we got into this morning
[32:30] let's go back read number three again i
[32:32] want you to see that one
[32:34] quote number three
[32:37] which is taken from
[32:43] it's taken from the rapture message
[32:46] he said the word rapture
[32:48] in the bible is not even used at all
[32:51] we just put that word there the bible
[32:53] says caught up
[32:54] being caught up we read here in a second
[32:56] this one which is first thessalonians
[32:58] either human being right
[33:00] or first thessalonians
[33:02] it is the order
[33:04] first thessalonians what
[33:07] it is the order of this great rapture
[33:11] that will take place in the last days
[33:15] what is the order of this great rapture
[33:20] the lord himself shall descend from
[33:22] heaven with a shout
[33:25] voice of an archangel
[33:26] and a trump
[33:29] right
[33:30] that's the order
[33:33] all right
[33:35] then we know
[33:37] and we're ended up this morning talking
[33:38] about it the shout is the message
[33:41] so the message had already went forth
[33:45] right
[33:46] right
[33:48] at least we ought to realize
[33:52] that the rapture
[33:54] is in process
[33:57] it's in stages of development whatever
[34:00] you want to use your terminologies
[34:04] it's in process
[34:08] and that's what when i saw that 40
[34:10] something years ago i've tried my best
[34:12] to explain it
[34:16] that we look at the lord descendant is
[34:19] this message
[34:23] this message was the descendant of god
[34:29] which was the prophet's message
[34:32] it wasn't the descendant of william
[34:34] branham
[34:38] the opening of the word
[34:40] are we looking for somebody else to come
[34:42] in to explain this
[34:46] or do we believe the messages already
[34:48] went forth
[34:52] you know what
[34:53] the rapture is in the process
[34:57] as i said this morning the day you got
[34:59] born again
[35:01] go read the future home
[35:03] save me the time of reading all the time
[35:07] when that holy ghost came in you
[35:09] you know what it done
[35:11] it burnt out everything and gave you the
[35:14] life of god you agree
[35:17] in the new birth
[35:18] you know what it done
[35:20] lay claimed on this old boy you're
[35:22] looking at it
[35:26] laid a claim on it
[35:28] that's why i don't believe you're going
[35:29] to get a new body
[35:32] i believe it's this body redeemed
[35:35] all right
[35:37] see because he lay claim on it why would
[35:40] he come and live in this body
[35:42] and say as the bible said
[35:44] that he's pleased to dwell in you
[35:49] oh no that was just about jesus
[35:55] oh in a way in a way you know you
[35:57] remember this morning
[35:59] the mule
[36:01] in a way you know
[36:06] if you don't believe him to be the same
[36:08] today as he's ever been
[36:10] then you've changed your god has changed
[36:12] somewhere
[36:16] yet that prophet preached and always
[36:18] preached one true and living god you
[36:19] agree
[36:21] but it was long in what 62 or right in
[36:24] there somewhere i don't know what
[36:25] exactly i gave them
[36:27] somewhere in the last of this or into
[36:29] the 60s
[36:30] when the lord showed him the rainbow
[36:32] coming down the three coming down and
[36:34] told him that the jehovah the old is the
[36:36] jesus of the new
[36:39] now what did he believe for then
[36:45] i can give you the quotes where he said
[36:46] it he said i used to think that jesus
[36:48] loved me and god hated me
[36:51] until i found out they were the same
[36:53] person
[36:54] right
[36:56] so there was a time he didn't fully
[36:58] understand
[37:01] and he said paul was the only one that
[37:03] understood it
[37:05] well the other disciple didn't believe
[37:07] in a trinity
[37:09] they just didn't believe in the depth of
[37:10] the revelation that paul had
[37:15] that's all i'm trying to get you and i
[37:16] to do read the word study the word
[37:23] you're not going to find the secret of a
[37:24] raps or anything in careers almanac or
[37:27] some newspaper
[37:29] or a playboy magazine
[37:33] or a love story
[37:36] you know
[37:40] but think about it
[37:43] what is the order of the rapture
[37:46] this great order he said he called god
[37:50] the lord himself shall descend from
[37:52] heaven with a shout
[37:54] we've done her that
[37:58] brother asked me a while ago he said
[38:00] something about where are we in that
[38:03] i said well
[38:05] you've got to remember one thing
[38:08] if somebody knew come in the message
[38:10] today
[38:13] and you could tell them the lord himself
[38:14] shall send them heaven to shout out
[38:16] voice of archangel trump they don't know
[38:17] what in the world are you talking about
[38:20] they know what you said
[38:23] but you know it takes the new birth to
[38:25] know
[38:26] that the shout
[38:28] is the message
[38:29] not a quote from a prophet
[38:32] but a revelation from god
[38:38] but you see you got people then at all
[38:40] different levels
[38:43] so some sitting here are just now
[38:44] beginning to understand
[38:47] there is now knowing that the shout is
[38:49] went forward
[38:51] but you've got others that know
[38:53] that it's a trumpet
[38:55] because this message is a gospel trumpet
[39:01] you see what i'm talking about
[39:06] but think now
[39:10] we are to be caught up
[39:12] by what
[39:15] we're to be caught up by this message
[39:19] above our reasoning our thinking that's
[39:21] true
[39:22] our old doctrines and ideas
[39:25] of what we thought it was
[39:27] and what grandma thought it was
[39:30] you know
[39:32] caught up in something real to us
[39:38] and see being caught up into it then we
[39:40] believe it
[39:42] all right
[39:44] but we believe that
[39:46] the order is
[39:48] that the resurrection has to come
[39:53] now
[39:57] who's going to call the dead from the
[39:58] grave
[40:01] amen i know a lot of doctrines and ideas
[40:06] but somebody is that's right
[40:10] that's right no matter what you think
[40:13] somebody's going to call the dead
[40:19] whether you believe return ministry
[40:20] brother brown's got to do it whether you
[40:22] believe that we are the people and
[40:24] it's going to be in us
[40:26] somebody is going to call the dead from
[40:29] the grave but we're not going out in the
[40:31] cemetery
[40:37] about 1914 you know they said the lord
[40:39] was coming he'd be with the wings and
[40:40] all they went up on the mountain up
[40:42] there and what in the tennessee's and
[40:44] sat down upon that mountain with their
[40:46] wings because he was coming
[40:49] brother branham said
[40:51] i can show you
[40:53] something happened
[40:58] come on
[40:59] but he said
[41:00] not what they thought
[41:05] i mean
[41:06] we'd all go to the graveyard this
[41:07] evening sit out there for two or three
[41:09] weeks starve to death hold him come out
[41:11] of the grave come out the grave come out
[41:12] of the grave come out the grave
[41:16] that ain't gonna bring nobody up
[41:21] but you know what i love about a prophet
[41:24] he said one day
[41:27] he said it's a great chain
[41:31] and he said one day
[41:33] adam were raised
[41:37] and he said he'll reach over touch eve
[41:40] and said the evil raise said she'll
[41:42] reach over and touch
[41:44] abel saith et cetera
[41:50] and brother branham says it whether you
[41:52] want to believe it or not
[41:54] but he says that one of these days
[41:57] those old testament saints are going to
[41:59] raise
[42:02] i believe they already raised well go
[42:03] ahead that's all right ain't going to
[42:05] argue with you
[42:06] i'm just going to quote the prophet
[42:09] he said those old testament saints will
[42:11] raise
[42:12] and we will fall right in line
[42:15] with them going up
[42:23] there's going to be a resurrection
[42:28] but it's not us going out there and
[42:30] hollering and screaming it's when the
[42:32] contact of faith is there
[42:38] when we get to believing what luther
[42:40] taught
[42:42] the truth of it not all the finest you
[42:44] know fault but what he taught the truth
[42:47] when we really believe that that's a
[42:49] connection to luther he's coming out of
[42:50] that grave
[42:54] but you see then we've got to believe it
[42:56] like wesley talk sanctification the
[42:59] truth of it
[43:01] they're coming out of the grave
[43:03] we've got to believe it like the
[43:04] pentecostals
[43:06] with the gifts
[43:08] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:09] brother around and said another great
[43:11] prophet came
[43:13] we don't want to him but he said at the
[43:15] end of the age the messenger would come
[43:18] we don't want to quote brother branham
[43:21] because it's contrary to our thoughts
[43:26] if we don't have
[43:28] the revelation they had
[43:31] who's going to bring them from the grave
[43:38] right but you see
[43:42] then we want to look at it it's like
[43:43] something that's
[43:45] a rabbit hat trick or some point that's
[43:48] coming or a pope out of the united
[43:50] states or
[43:51] you know
[43:54] are we here now
[43:57] but we're here now
[43:59] brother ran him back in the 50s did you
[44:01] watch until russia comes down after that
[44:04] oil
[44:08] they've been down there a long time
[44:12] you get a map of israel and look at it
[44:14] and see if the bible's not right when it
[44:17] says
[44:18] israel shall be compassed about of all
[44:20] nations you know what we're one of those
[44:24] nations on one side
[44:27] and russia's on the other one and
[44:28] china's on the other one everything's
[44:30] ready
[44:33] but we're looking for russia to come out
[44:34] to oil and they're already there
[44:41] come on
[44:42] they said in kuwait that we took kuwait
[44:45] because
[44:46] 50 years from then you would need a
[44:49] pipeline to bring oil to america so
[44:52] evidently it means it's going to be cut
[44:54] off somewhere else
[44:57] you don't read
[45:01] but you see church russia coming after
[45:03] that in the united states
[45:05] and don't put us in the rapture
[45:08] remember my point
[45:10] the dead has got to be raised first
[45:13] that's bible
[45:17] let's talk about the dead racing
[45:21] no i want to be i i want to be i want to
[45:23] hear about the rapture
[45:28] all right
[45:30] let's hear about a rapture
[45:33] going to number 11 brother and let's
[45:35] read it
[45:44] this is taken from the rapture message
[45:46] rs6566
[45:49] but to the church the bride
[45:52] the rapture is a revelation to her
[45:56] come on
[46:01] it's revealed to her
[46:02] that
[46:03] the revelation
[46:05] the true to bright true bride of christ
[46:07] will be waiting
[46:08] for the revelation of the rapture
[46:18] that's what he says
[46:21] now he explains a revelation
[46:28] that's a revelation for revelation is
[46:30] faith
[46:32] you cannot have a revelation without it
[46:34] being faith
[46:35] faith is revelation because it's
[46:37] something that's revealed to you faith
[46:39] is revelation
[46:40] faith is something that has been
[46:42] revealed to you
[46:43] like it was to abraham
[46:46] amen
[46:47] that could call anything contrary to
[46:50] what
[46:51] had been revealed to him now what's he
[46:53] talking about abraham
[46:54] say what the baby right
[46:58] as though it wasn't so
[47:00] now faith that's what faith is is the
[47:03] revelation of god the church is built
[47:06] upon a revelation the whole entire body
[47:13] the rapture is a revelation amen
[47:19] the bride will be waiting for the
[47:20] revelation of the rapture
[47:22] that's what he said
[47:29] would our revelation be enough
[47:31] sufficient to go to israel
[47:39] wouldn't it be something to go over
[47:40] there with the people of this message
[47:42] this doctrine
[47:44] without we we believe jesus was god
[47:47] but we don't believe he was god to the
[47:49] river jordan
[47:52] i thought you would look at you and say
[47:54] you catholic
[48:00] but you know what people swear they
[48:01] think that's
[48:03] the revelation
[48:09] will your revelation bring a rapture
[48:19] simple
[48:24] but yet that's deep in it
[48:27] what's deep about me asking a simple
[48:29] question
[48:32] the prophet said the rapture is a
[48:34] revelation to her
[48:39] he said she'd be waiting for the
[48:41] revelation of the rapture
[48:43] now
[48:47] we're supposed to take a trip
[48:50] we've talked about trying to get
[48:52] together again one of these days we took
[48:53] a trip up to jeffersonville years ago
[48:55] and i'd really love to go again with a
[48:56] lot of if you'd like to go
[48:58] you know
[48:59] and you know
[49:01] but we were getting ready to go there
[49:03] was something like 50 of us
[49:05] and we were getting ready to go
[49:08] well you know
[49:10] i cautioned the people where we were
[49:12] going to meet the bus driver
[49:16] and i told him we are not coming to your
[49:19] house
[49:23] and if you're not at park and ride at
[49:26] oakwood at a certain time
[49:29] we're leaving without you
[49:33] you know everybody thinks they're so
[49:34] important
[49:37] they won't leave me
[49:38] this is one oh boy that will
[49:42] when i tell you we're leaving at 10
[49:44] o'clock
[49:46] we're going to leave at 10 o'clock
[49:48] don't call me 45 minutes down the road
[49:51] and say
[49:52] can you wait on me
[49:55] no
[49:57] you drive
[50:00] what's the matter with that
[50:04] you know
[50:06] what's wrong with it i mean
[50:08] you're waiting for something
[50:10] you're going to take a train
[50:12] you don't go to the bus depot
[50:15] right
[50:20] now what did the prophet mean when he
[50:22] said the bride to be waiting for the
[50:23] revelation to rapture
[50:26] i remember brother moa priest a message
[50:28] 40 something years ago
[50:32] and it struck with me
[50:36] you got to come to a place to be waiting
[50:38] right
[50:42] look right there behind me on that
[50:44] drawing
[50:50] right
[50:55] no
[50:56] rapture
[50:59] in the church ages
[51:01] what your prophet said now you quote him
[51:06] where would you be waiting
[51:09] for a revelation of the rapture
[51:14] all right right there
[51:17] can you say you're waiting
[51:19] you're at the bus depot and you got your
[51:21] ticket in your hand
[51:24] well you're down here playing around in
[51:25] the garbage cans and i don't mean that
[51:27] about statue burger man i'm talking
[51:29] about being down well
[51:33] god will make a way for me
[51:36] like a brother told me one time he
[51:37] quoted brother branham you know brought
[51:39] around and said you've got a question go
[51:40] to put somebody on the pulpit that's a
[51:42] quote
[51:46] the brother said if he wants me to hear
[51:47] at my church
[51:49] he'll send somebody there
[51:51] i said but if he
[51:53] don't choose to do that you might have
[51:55] to go somewhere else
[51:58] if he instructs you to go to the bus
[52:01] depot
[52:02] you need to go to the bus depot
[52:05] right that's right
[52:08] waiting for revelation
[52:12] and you only be waiting when you're
[52:13] connected to faith
[52:18] you're prayed for right
[52:20] does god do it this way sometimes you're
[52:22] prayed for and you believe you're healed
[52:26] right
[52:27] you know sometimes he doesn't bring that
[52:29] to pass right then
[52:32] amen he waits to see whether you got the
[52:34] revelation of it or not right
[52:40] where are you going to be waiting for
[52:41] the revelation of the rapture
[52:43] well i'll go to church when i want to
[52:46] bless god you can't make me go to church
[52:48] all the time watch all this junk started
[52:50] about got to go to church every service
[52:52] we ought to go to church every day
[52:57] now you want to argue that point
[53:04] ain't got no argument so don't stand up
[53:06] and say nothing to me
[53:09] the most important thing
[53:11] is not who's going to be president
[53:18] it's whether or not the word is being
[53:20] preached
[53:21] and if i miss it
[53:23] i might
[53:25] not get it
[53:29] yeah but we got the internet we got the
[53:31] tapes yup and fire can go off and we go
[53:33] on every bit of it
[53:37] right
[53:41] there's never been a discussion in our
[53:43] family of whether we would go into
[53:44] church or not
[53:50] the only time i really remember us
[53:52] having friday saturday sunday services
[53:53] brother moak's scheduled one time and
[53:56] you know where i was at on thursday
[54:00] i was laying in the hospital
[54:04] my back was killing me
[54:08] friday i begged a doctor to let me go
[54:11] home
[54:14] he said i'll let you go home if you'll
[54:16] go home and go to bed
[54:18] i didn't lie to him
[54:20] i just didn't tell him what i was gonna
[54:21] do
[54:24] but it was already pre-planned
[54:27] i come right here with a heating pad and
[54:30] i sit down in a pew on friday night
[54:34] saturday night i had the heat and pad
[54:36] sunday i had a heating pad
[54:38] monday or tuesday tuesday one or two
[54:41] somewhere in there god delivered me
[54:46] there wasn't a choice
[54:48] now when i talk like that people say
[54:50] well you mean we're supposed to come to
[54:52] church when you're sick i thought that
[54:54] was the place we need to come to when
[54:55] we're sick
[54:57] now don't come in with a high
[54:58] temperature cause you can pass your
[54:59] diseases i ain't silly
[55:02] but we do have a back room
[55:10] where do you think he's supposed to be
[55:11] when you're sick
[55:15] but we're ready for a rapture
[55:18] i got one coming after this but right
[55:20] around says we can't have faith
[55:22] for divine healing
[55:25] let alone a rapture
[55:30] don't worry about the rapture until the
[55:32] dead's raised
[55:36] we better work on how to get the dead
[55:37] out of the ground
[55:44] what if it's connected to your
[55:45] revelation
[55:49] what if it's connected to what you
[55:51] believe
[55:54] you see why i believe around the world
[55:57] the ministry of jesus christ
[56:00] is in the bride around the world
[56:03] that don't put it all in lula georgia
[56:06] there's not going to be no more of these
[56:07] prophets come on the scene
[56:09] like brother branham was to be we don't
[56:11] believe in junk
[56:13] but there is a five-fold ministry and in
[56:16] that there is prophets apostles
[56:18] evangelist pastors teachers
[56:21] far to perfecting of the saints
[56:24] how are we supposed to get these virtues
[56:26] to be waiting
[56:31] bless god i get it myself
[56:33] good woman preacher
[56:39] do i need to explain that why don't you
[56:40] say it
[56:42] it's a good warming preacher ain't going
[56:43] to listen to him man
[56:49] i know i shouldn't say what i'm fixing
[56:51] to but it still comes our what about
[56:53] these men preachers that are warming
[56:55] preacher spirit
[56:58] he said what do you mean
[57:00] i mean
[57:02] to take eve's
[57:04] life
[57:09] he was the first woman preacher she's
[57:12] done a good job preaching to the devil
[57:14] until he out preached her
[57:19] and she got caught
[57:21] so you showed me a woman preacher
[57:23] anywhere's ever mounted anything
[57:29] but then i'll go ahead and say it
[57:30] because i don't mind saying it i'd
[57:32] rather listen to a lot of women
[57:34] talk about this message than a lot of
[57:36] preachers that's in this message
[57:40] take that and swallow it
[57:43] that's good dale isn't it
[57:45] he's sitting there laughing
[57:50] because i'd rather see
[57:53] i got a question to ask the preacher
[57:54] that said
[57:56] my wife was a best woman preacher he
[57:58] ever heard of
[58:01] i got a question to ask him
[58:03] i want to know is he being derogatory
[58:06] calling her a woman preacher
[58:10] or is he saying that she's got a greater
[58:12] revelation that most of the preachers
[58:14] has got and she needs to be preaching to
[58:16] him i want to know which one he's saying
[58:18] i will get a chance and ask that
[58:20] question
[58:23] but i do i believe she's got a greater
[58:25] revelation
[58:27] than the biggest portion of these
[58:28] preachers is
[58:31] in the message
[58:37] come on sisters
[58:40] you've got a right to have a revelation
[58:42] too
[58:46] but think about it now revelation
[58:52] going to number 12 and let's just get
[58:53] down to something the prophet's talking
[58:55] about because i quoted this this morning
[58:58] this is paragraph 129 and 130
[59:02] like 131. rapture
[59:05] from the 13th to 16th verse
[59:08] there is three things that has to happen
[59:09] before the lord himself appears
[59:16] quickly now so we can close see the
[59:19] first thing happens notice a shout out a
[59:21] voice a trumpet
[59:23] let's read it now we'll see that it's
[59:24] right the lord himself 16th verse shall
[59:26] descend from heaven with a shout and
[59:29] with the voice of the archangel and the
[59:32] trump of god
[59:34] all right three things happens a voice a
[59:37] shout out voice or trumpet
[59:39] has to happen before jesus appears
[59:46] now shout
[59:47] jesus does all three of them when he's
[59:51] he's he's he's descending
[59:57] he doesn't stutter very much does he
[59:59] wonder if he's emphasizing something
[1:00:01] right a shout what is a shout it's a
[1:00:04] message going forth first the living
[1:00:06] bread of life
[1:00:07] bringing forth the bride
[1:00:12] three things
[1:00:15] happens and he does them all three in
[1:00:17] his descending
[1:00:19] it's not minding your descending it's
[1:00:22] not minding your rapture
[1:00:25] if we get that out of the way we might
[1:00:27] be able to understand
[1:00:29] he's not coming after you and me he's
[1:00:32] coming after himself
[1:00:34] that he left in you and i
[1:00:38] right right
[1:00:43] that's why he's
[1:00:45] doing it
[1:00:46] but it's in a process from the day you
[1:00:48] got born again
[1:00:52] a growth development started
[1:00:55] of going up the statue of a perfect man
[1:01:02] right
[1:01:04] read the statue of perfect man and see
[1:01:06] brother branham said
[1:01:08] these things are a requirement
[1:01:12] now my point has always been how do we
[1:01:14] get them
[1:01:17] how do we get
[1:01:19] virtual knowledge to emphasis godliness
[1:01:21] brotherly kind of because faith is not
[1:01:26] a uh
[1:01:27] virtue faith is a birth
[1:01:33] you better go to reading if you think i
[1:01:35] can't read brother brown says there's
[1:01:37] seven ads
[1:01:44] do you need that quote
[1:01:46] he says there's seven ads i'd like for
[1:01:48] you to look behind me i hope if zero in
[1:01:50] on the screen on that and i'd like for
[1:01:52] you to count
[1:01:55] there's eight things there
[1:01:58] faith virtue knowledge tempers patience
[1:02:01] god in this brotherly kindness
[1:02:04] holy spirit love
[1:02:07] you you can even come out count nine if
[1:02:09] you want to really get into it
[1:02:11] but he says there's seven ads
[1:02:14] you don't add faith
[1:02:18] faith is a birth
[1:02:20] you add virtue
[1:02:23] knowledge temperance patience
[1:02:27] then the holy ghost is the last thing to
[1:02:29] be added
[1:02:31] which is love
[1:02:36] but you see in that then what are we
[1:02:38] looking for
[1:02:41] that to be
[1:02:43] brought into being
[1:02:48] let me just scan these and we won't have
[1:02:50] to pull them up
[1:02:51] on the message of sardis in church age
[1:02:54] page 256 but around says but you
[1:02:56] christians rejoice in your being caught
[1:02:59] up
[1:03:00] here are the words of your heavenly
[1:03:02] leader
[1:03:03] come unto me
[1:03:05] answer with one voice even so we come
[1:03:15] we know that
[1:03:19] noah
[1:03:21] represented the
[1:03:24] tribulation saints
[1:03:26] he doesn't represent the bride
[1:03:29] he rose up come over went back down to
[1:03:30] outer drunk
[1:03:32] he represents the tribulation saints
[1:03:34] that received
[1:03:35] you know life
[1:03:37] he said enoch was a type of the rapture
[1:03:41] all right
[1:03:43] enoch the top of the rapture
[1:03:47] well you know according to the
[1:03:49] scriptures
[1:03:51] enoch walked with god
[1:03:54] and i know it's 360 years or something
[1:03:56] look around says 500 years
[1:04:01] that's no problem that's not a
[1:04:03] contradiction
[1:04:05] he can't keep his numbers straight
[1:04:11] but enoch walked with god
[1:04:14] brother brown said
[1:04:16] he had rapture and faith
[1:04:21] but the raps are such a great thing it's
[1:04:23] so hard it's something we don't
[1:04:26] understand
[1:04:27] and yet enoch
[1:04:29] without the new birth
[1:04:34] walk with god and was not
[1:04:37] the bible says because god took him
[1:04:40] why did god take him
[1:04:45] why did god take enoch
[1:04:49] i guess the way part is higher or what
[1:04:51] he looked like or some great genealogy
[1:04:57] no read the bible
[1:04:59] amen
[1:05:03] said he took him because he had one
[1:05:05] testimony that he pleased god
[1:05:14] and he was caught up with me
[1:05:18] he just walked off the earth
[1:05:24] you know what enoch was doing at that
[1:05:25] time
[1:05:26] was hanging around over there where they
[1:05:27] was building the ark
[1:05:29] i mean excuse me building the
[1:05:31] the pyramid the one she opts it doesn't
[1:05:33] have a head on it you know
[1:05:38] and in that is a complete plan of
[1:05:40] redemption et cetera et cetera
[1:05:46] and enoch pleased god with rapture and
[1:05:48] faith your prophet said
[1:05:52] rapturing revelation
[1:05:56] how many gods did he believe in
[1:06:06] it was not because god took him
[1:06:09] why because he pleased god
[1:06:13] now
[1:06:14] if we come up this statue of perfect man
[1:06:16] correctly
[1:06:18] true
[1:06:20] don't you think it's going to be said of
[1:06:21] us that these
[1:06:23] these are my beloved sons i'm pleased to
[1:06:25] dwell
[1:06:28] what are you getting at brother dale i'm
[1:06:29] getting at one time
[1:06:33] it wasn't a great big thing that enoch
[1:06:36] done
[1:06:39] you know
[1:06:41] it was the fact that he could believe
[1:06:43] god
[1:06:45] and he walked with him
[1:06:48] all of his life
[1:06:52] you mean never done nothing wrong i
[1:06:54] didn't say that brother branham didn't
[1:06:56] say that
[1:07:00] it says about elijah that he was a man
[1:07:02] of like passion
[1:07:08] anymore elisha one had a little bit of a
[1:07:09] temper one in there because he cursed
[1:07:11] him
[1:07:12] kids and the she buyers ate them up
[1:07:18] remember they didn't have the holy ghost
[1:07:19] back there
[1:07:20] isn't it odd that enoch could walk off
[1:07:22] the earth without the holy ghost and we
[1:07:24] can't even live with it
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:37] what is going to be the rapture that's
[1:07:39] what we're looking at somebody's going
[1:07:41] to do this somebody's going to do that
[1:07:43] somebody's going to come and tell us
[1:07:44] this somebody's going to tell us that
[1:07:46] somebody's going to do this
[1:07:51] his brother dean was bringing out the
[1:07:53] other day
[1:07:55] you know in one scripture there in the
[1:07:56] bible if a prophet give you a sign
[1:07:59] you're supposed to believe him
[1:08:02] that's good i believe that but you know
[1:08:04] there's another scripture it says for
[1:08:05] prophet gives you a sign and the sign
[1:08:08] comes to pass
[1:08:10] but he takes you to another god you
[1:08:12] remember that in the scripture
[1:08:18] the people of this message
[1:08:20] are the most gullible group of people
[1:08:24] that i've ever been associated with
[1:08:28] what i mean by gullible somebody can
[1:08:30] come along with some kind of little gift
[1:08:32] and they just run after it
[1:08:34] you know
[1:08:38] oh this is it
[1:08:39] what we've been waiting on
[1:08:46] i'm not waiting on but one time
[1:08:52] i'm waiting on god to reveal to me
[1:08:56] what to preach next
[1:09:00] because i believe
[1:09:02] what i've preached is the truth
[1:09:09] you know that somebody one day is going
[1:09:10] to come out and say i'm already changed
[1:09:20] well you know what most people are going
[1:09:22] to say get the straight jacket the guy's
[1:09:23] gone kooky
[1:09:26] well i thought that we must
[1:09:28] confess and believe that we're healed
[1:09:30] before we can be healed
[1:09:32] that was what i understood i thought
[1:09:35] that we must confess with our mouth and
[1:09:37] believe in our heart according to romans
[1:09:39] before we can be saved
[1:09:48] remember the scripture there where it
[1:09:49] says this is that i believe it's in the
[1:09:51] book of acts right
[1:09:53] this is that
[1:09:56] you know what brother ryan said one day
[1:09:57] he said if this thing that let me keep
[1:09:59] this so that gets here because he really
[1:10:02] believed that this was that
[1:10:05] my point is can you and i see a living
[1:10:08] god
[1:10:09] right here today
[1:10:11] in 2014
[1:10:15] are we still looking for something to
[1:10:17] happen
[1:10:21] what have we found out is already taking
[1:10:23] place
[1:10:26] what have we found out the shouts
[1:10:28] already went for it
[1:10:29] what we found out divorce of the
[1:10:31] archangel
[1:10:33] is in the bride
[1:10:41] what if we found out this message has
[1:10:43] already called us up
[1:10:52] you know way i talk
[1:10:54] i'd rather go through life
[1:10:57] seeking god
[1:11:03] than to not seek him at all
[1:11:07] your prophet saw god more and more but
[1:11:10] yet one day he looked back and he said
[1:11:16] lord
[1:11:17] you've done showed me that these things
[1:11:19] is
[1:11:21] here
[1:11:22] and i'm not saying you're coming i'm
[1:11:24] saying you're here
[1:11:29] when are we going to say that
[1:11:33] well when i see when i i when i see the
[1:11:36] great signs and wonders
[1:11:39] okay
[1:11:41] we've seen the dead raised here
[1:11:46] let's move over to another church where
[1:11:47] somewhere else and find out what they've
[1:11:50] seen
[1:11:54] what if they've seen god move
[1:11:56] in healings and signs and wonders then
[1:11:59] let's move to another church and see
[1:12:01] what they believe
[1:12:06] we might be looking at something instead
[1:12:08] of far something
[1:12:10] that's all i've ever tried to get you to
[1:12:11] do
[1:12:14] a god of history will do you no good
[1:12:22] but revelation will change us
[1:12:26] right
[1:12:28] a revelation
[1:12:30] see we all go up together
[1:12:33] and even in
[1:12:37] look at my notes
[1:12:39] paul said in another place
[1:12:41] that we'll all be changed
[1:12:45] right
[1:12:47] you know the resurrection is going to
[1:12:48] come and we'll all be changed
[1:12:52] i don't believe the resurrection's going
[1:12:54] to come to them they're going to be 80
[1:12:55] years old got to be changed back to 20
[1:12:57] years old i believe their change will be
[1:12:59] them coming out of the ground
[1:13:01] all right but you and i are going to be
[1:13:03] changed
[1:13:05] in a moment a twinkling of an eye
[1:13:10] because of this message
[1:13:13] i believe that 45 years why quit now
[1:13:19] i've taught it all these years why stop
[1:13:21] now
[1:13:25] i believe jesus christ the same
[1:13:27] yesterday today and forever
[1:13:31] i believe he's here as brother branham
[1:13:32] said
[1:13:34] in every way
[1:13:37] outside of the corporal body
[1:13:40] you want that quote
[1:13:42] be glad to run back a few messages and
[1:13:44] read it to you
[1:13:48] if it's hebrews 13 8 what are we going
[1:13:50] to believe
[1:13:55] church
[1:13:57] when are we going to just settle down
[1:13:59] and say look
[1:14:03] i believe jesus christ is the same
[1:14:05] yesterday today and forever
[1:14:07] the same god that walked the shores of
[1:14:09] galilee is right here now
[1:14:14] but you see
[1:14:16] when you do that
[1:14:17] or where's the signs and the wonders
[1:14:22] well let me quote brother branham
[1:14:26] they got signs and wonders
[1:14:32] are we supposed to run after signs and
[1:14:34] wonders are we supposed to run after the
[1:14:37] word
[1:14:38] which is the way
[1:14:41] but now brother dale when you have
[1:14:43] the word you'll always have signs and
[1:14:45] wonders we've seen the dead rays how
[1:14:47] many pastors can claim that across the
[1:14:49] land in america today
[1:14:52] that we've seen the dead raised
[1:15:01] but you know what people would rather
[1:15:02] listen to some pastor that has no
[1:15:05] no
[1:15:06] doings whatsoever to tell you
[1:15:11] you know
[1:15:13] that just gets me i'm sorry
[1:15:17] it gets me to think about people
[1:15:20] that we put our whole life
[1:15:23] upon this message
[1:15:26] and now that it comes down to the end of
[1:15:28] it all
[1:15:31] do we really have everything
[1:15:33] upon this message
[1:15:36] i know people in this message
[1:15:39] their churches has got a swiss bank
[1:15:41] account
[1:15:44] why do you need a swiss bank account
[1:15:48] just in case things don't work out right
[1:15:51] you got somewhere to go
[1:15:53] right
[1:15:55] i got all my eggs and one basket
[1:15:58] don't do that financially it's not a
[1:15:59] good advice right don't you lose it all
[1:16:02] at one time
[1:16:03] but in the gospel i got it all based on
[1:16:06] one thing
[1:16:09] if this message is not right i am the
[1:16:12] most deceived person
[1:16:13] there is in the world
[1:16:18] no matter what they can say about
[1:16:20] brother branham or whatever they call
[1:16:22] him or say that he's done
[1:16:25] the message he brought has brought me
[1:16:28] to jesus christ amen
[1:16:36] the god that i saw when i was 11 years
[1:16:38] old
[1:16:41] standing in a church
[1:16:43] he's brought that god to me
[1:16:46] hallelujah
[1:16:51] by revelation
[1:16:56] what can you say
[1:17:00] that's why i don't have anything else
[1:17:01] it's not nothing else why would i want
[1:17:03] anything else
[1:17:06] he's kept us straight here in lula for
[1:17:09] 50 years why would we want to worry
[1:17:11] about anything else
[1:17:15] we never run after the two souls the two
[1:17:17] lords the seventh under virgil that
[1:17:18] proves he is the son of man's the
[1:17:22] doctrines that all these churches went
[1:17:24] after
[1:17:26] well you're just bragging
[1:17:29] will come and show me where i did father
[1:17:31] some of it
[1:17:33] i'll show you the tapes where it didn't
[1:17:35] because we still got them all from 82
[1:17:39] until now
[1:17:44] how many preachers how many pastors
[1:17:47] would let you have ten years of their
[1:17:49] sermons
[1:17:51] all you gonna do is click on internet
[1:17:52] you get everyone
[1:17:54] maybe richard like some being having him
[1:17:56] put on but you know the biggest fortune
[1:17:59] comes on the internet
[1:18:01] you can see what i preached 20 years ago
[1:18:04] you see when i preached 40 years ago
[1:18:06] almost
[1:18:09] how many preachers would do that
[1:18:14] they don't even take their sermons
[1:18:17] right
[1:18:21] but you see i've got an advantage and
[1:18:23] disadvantage
[1:18:25] because if i change somewhere you can
[1:18:27] find a change
[1:18:29] but i've had people to come to me and
[1:18:31] say brother dale you said so and so it's
[1:18:33] okay
[1:18:34] we go get the tape
[1:18:37] and we're going to find out whether i
[1:18:39] said that or not
[1:18:43] i've got that advantage
[1:18:47] that i can pull the tape and play it to
[1:18:49] you
[1:18:50] and say now you show me where i said it
[1:18:55] but people don't like you like that
[1:18:59] they want you to be wishy-washy
[1:19:04] we're in a day when everybody wants
[1:19:07] everybody to be bad
[1:19:09] right
[1:19:12] just a little bit
[1:19:14] that way nobody can't say nothing about
[1:19:16] nobody else because we all got little
[1:19:18] problems
[1:19:22] well
[1:19:23] i'll agree with you we've got plenty of
[1:19:25] them
[1:19:28] but i believe god has been honored he's
[1:19:30] honored his word and he's kept his word
[1:19:36] he's revealed himself to us
[1:19:40] to the opening of the word
[1:19:42] that's all i've ever tried to teach you
[1:19:44] it doesn't make anything out of me that
[1:19:46] makes something out of a great god
[1:19:52] well
[1:19:53] i just don't like your attitude well
[1:19:55] good i don't like yours either
[1:19:57] now what are we doing
[1:20:00] man does that solve any problems
[1:20:08] what about the word
[1:20:12] that's all i care about
[1:20:14] is the word
[1:20:18] like i've told you paul had a greater
[1:20:20] revelation
[1:20:22] than any of the rest of them
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:26] and brother branham had the greatest of
[1:20:28] all revelations
[1:20:31] that he had a greater revelation than
[1:20:32] the apostle paul
[1:20:35] i believe that
[1:20:37] but i believe the only one now
[1:20:40] that could have a greater revelation
[1:20:42] than brother branham
[1:20:44] is almighty god
[1:20:49] the bride's not going to have no greater
[1:20:51] revelation
[1:20:53] it's just going to take this revelation
[1:20:56] that has been delivered unto us
[1:21:02] rapturing faith
[1:21:05] lays in this message
[1:21:08] we quoted it as being in the tapes of
[1:21:10] books i think that's not correct that
[1:21:11] way
[1:21:13] uh
[1:21:14] brother joe's got it for you if you want
[1:21:16] it worth laying at raise
[1:21:19] in this message revealed
[1:21:24] so what do we need anything else
[1:21:28] but we need to keep digging
[1:21:31] there's wonderful nuggets laying in this
[1:21:33] message
[1:21:34] that we've only skimmed the surface off
[1:21:41] great things that are there
[1:21:44] but remember we can't get anything
[1:21:46] contrary
[1:21:48] to what the original brought
[1:21:52] and i don't care what your great
[1:21:54] revelation is
[1:21:55] and i don't care what your signs and
[1:21:58] wonders are
[1:21:59] i thought that believers
[1:22:03] didn't have to have signs
[1:22:08] i thought science followed the believer
[1:22:12] i didn't know the believer followed
[1:22:13] signs
[1:22:18] okay
[1:22:20] but a man with a great revelation
[1:22:23] what about all of the people that was
[1:22:25] there what about the great peter
[1:22:27] that opened the door to the gentiles and
[1:22:29] i mean the jews and into the gentiles
[1:22:31] all of the things happened
[1:22:36] we did a man like paul
[1:22:39] never set in the communion service with
[1:22:42] the lord jesus
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:45] right right
[1:22:49] but peter and them did why were they not
[1:22:51] chosen to explain communion
[1:23:00] you know why
[1:23:02] because they couldn't understand it
[1:23:04] they saw it
[1:23:07] they witnessed it
[1:23:11] but the apostle paul was chosen let's
[1:23:13] stand
[1:23:15] let's go into the communion
[1:23:17] paul in first corinthians 11 chapter
[1:23:19] 23rd verse
[1:23:24] for i have received of the lord that
[1:23:26] which also i delivered unto you
[1:23:28] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:23:30] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:23:34] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:23:36] it and said
[1:23:38] now paul wasn't there when this took
[1:23:40] place
[1:23:44] right
[1:23:45] but yet he's explaining it that's why i
[1:23:48] love the book of luke luke was not an
[1:23:50] original disciple
[1:23:56] not being one of the original disciples
[1:23:58] but yet he says in the beginning he said
[1:24:01] having perfect
[1:24:03] understanding
[1:24:04] that's right
[1:24:06] that's something
[1:24:08] but we ought to live draw peter ought to
[1:24:10] be the one to explain it
[1:24:14] no when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:24:17] it and said take heat this is my body
[1:24:19] which is broken for you this due in
[1:24:20] remembrance of me
[1:24:22] after the same manner also he took the
[1:24:24] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:24:26] is the new testament in my blood this
[1:24:29] due years off as you drink it in
[1:24:31] remembrance of me
[1:24:32] or as often as you eat this bread and
[1:24:34] drink this cup
[1:24:36] you do shoe of the lord's death till he
[1:24:37] come
[1:24:38] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:24:41] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:24:43] unworthily
[1:24:45] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:24:47] the lord
[1:24:48] but let a man examine himself
[1:24:51] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:24:53] drink of that cup
[1:24:54] he that eaters and drinketh unworthily
[1:24:56] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:25:00] not discerning the lord's body
[1:25:03] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:25:05] among you and many sleep
[1:25:07] for we would judge ourselves we should
[1:25:09] not be judged i love this scripture
[1:25:12] but when we are judged
[1:25:15] we're chastened to the lord
[1:25:18] why
[1:25:19] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:25:20] world
[1:25:22] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:25:23] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:25:26] and if any man in hunger
[1:25:28] let him eat at home
[1:25:30] did you come not together under
[1:25:31] condemnation
[1:25:33] the rest when i said in order
[1:25:35] when i come
[1:25:37] like wade was explaining there one time
[1:25:40] you go back there and you pick up all of
[1:25:41] those
[1:25:43] and as smart as i am i didn't know that
[1:25:50] he was explaining it one night and i sat
[1:25:51] there and i said
[1:25:53] lord i didn't ever see that
[1:25:58] that when they come through and got
[1:26:00] ready for that
[1:26:01] last meal
[1:26:03] they had a part there
[1:26:06] that when jesus come over and
[1:26:09] ate the meal with him he turned around
[1:26:13] and fulfilled what that spoke of
[1:26:16] and took the bread
[1:26:18] and blessed it and passed it out
[1:26:21] he took the wine he all he added to it
[1:26:23] was this is my body
[1:26:27] i'm the one that all of this was meant
[1:26:31] you know that always even the jews today
[1:26:34] when they have their great meals and
[1:26:36] their great things of celebration
[1:26:38] there's a cheer left
[1:26:40] for elijah
[1:26:44] they believe elijah will come and
[1:26:47] precede the coming messiah
[1:26:50] well
[1:26:52] that's wonderful
[1:26:56] that's what i told reuben i said reuben
[1:26:59] do you believe in the coming of a
[1:27:01] messiah
[1:27:03] i just believe that jesus was that
[1:27:06] messiah
[1:27:09] i said do you mind if we pray for you
[1:27:12] he's itching all over
[1:27:14] i said you mind if we pray for you then
[1:27:17] we're going to pray for you
[1:27:18] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:27:22] because we believe he was the messiah
[1:27:25] he said go ahead the next morning he
[1:27:27] come walking through the building over
[1:27:29] to the side
[1:27:30] i said reuben
[1:27:31] he said he hadn't been sleeping real
[1:27:32] good at night he'd been taking like
[1:27:34] three or four bass
[1:27:35] to stop the stinging
[1:27:37] i said reuben you sleep good last night
[1:27:42] he said all
[1:27:44] night i said god touched you he said
[1:27:47] yeah
[1:27:51] see those jews are not a bunch of idiots
[1:28:00] they know the scriptures
[1:28:03] do we know them though
[1:28:06] what are we just well there's just
[1:28:07] something happening they just finally
[1:28:09] thought about having the communion
[1:28:12] no it's already there
[1:28:19] what do we think about it
[1:28:21] the bible said they turned for a moment
[1:28:23] before they went on into the rest of it
[1:28:24] so let's just stop for a moment now
[1:28:26] silent prayer pray one for another the
[1:28:28] lord bless
[1:28:30] each and every one of us
[1:28:33] in his love
[1:28:52] father we take communion
[1:28:55] because it was commanded unto us
[1:28:58] until you come again
[1:29:01] some people have got so revelated they
[1:29:02] don't take communion anymore
[1:29:06] but yet they know you haven't fulfilled
[1:29:08] your coming
[1:29:11] just help us lord
[1:29:14] to see a reality
[1:29:16] we know this is not your body
[1:29:18] this is not your blood we understand
[1:29:20] that
[1:29:22] it's in symbol form
[1:29:25] we thank you
[1:29:27] now just let that symbol become a
[1:29:29] reality in our hearts and our lives
[1:29:32] we've seen the sick healed because of
[1:29:33] the communion that people have taken
[1:29:36] and we believe you
[1:29:38] we thank you lord
[1:29:40] just be with us now and all of us
[1:29:41] together in jesus name
[1:29:46] the bible said he took bread and he
[1:29:47] blessed it
[1:29:50] father we just ask you to bless this
[1:29:51] bread it's been made for this purpose
[1:29:53] today
[1:29:54] the purpose for us to take communion
[1:29:57] to
[1:29:59] honor
[1:30:00] you and your word and do what you say
[1:30:02] for us to do
[1:30:03] we just ask you lord to sanctify the
[1:30:05] bread and the partakers
[1:30:07] we know this is not your body it's just
[1:30:09] in a symbol
[1:30:11] but what a symbol is to us lord
[1:30:14] it's close to a reality
[1:30:17] just help us lord and goddess keep us
[1:30:20] sanctify the partakers and the bread
[1:30:23] itself lord
[1:30:24] in jesus name
[1:30:38] i always say to you that
[1:30:40] we thought we had it all figured out
[1:30:42] didn't
[1:30:44] not throwing off on no baptist that's
[1:30:45] just where i come from
[1:30:50] we used to order communion bread
[1:30:55] and we'd order a little package of it
[1:30:58] it was made from unleavened bread
[1:31:02] but then we'd take it and
[1:31:05] we'd only take communion about every
[1:31:06] three months
[1:31:08] and we'd take it and we'd
[1:31:10] freeze that bread
[1:31:14] we're too stingy to go buy another
[1:31:16] dollar's worth of bread
[1:31:20] so we take that and we'd
[1:31:21] put it in the freezer
[1:31:24] three months later we'd take that bread
[1:31:26] out and
[1:31:27] warm it up
[1:31:29] take the communion
[1:31:32] and we were so religious until we never
[1:31:34] believed in drinking wine
[1:31:36] oh no
[1:31:38] you know
[1:31:40] so we'd make it
[1:31:42] as grape juice
[1:31:45] and we'd
[1:31:47] have a little grape juice
[1:31:51] and that wasn't what jesus said
[1:31:55] father we thank you for this wine it's
[1:31:58] going through the process and lord
[1:32:01] it doesn't rot and then deteriorate
[1:32:04] it stays
[1:32:06] we believe you father and we ask you to
[1:32:08] just help us
[1:32:09] we know it's not your blood
[1:32:11] it's only in a symbol
[1:32:12] we ask you to sanctify
[1:32:15] the wine if it was the blood if it was
[1:32:17] the body why would we be asking to
[1:32:19] sanctify it lord so we ask you to
[1:32:21] sanctify these things
[1:32:23] and as we eat the little piece of bread
[1:32:25] and as we drink the little bit of wine
[1:32:28] that even tomorrow there'll be blood
[1:32:30] cells coming from that to help us to be
[1:32:33] growing in human beings
[1:32:36] we just ask you to sanctify the wine and
[1:32:38] the partakers in jesus name
[1:32:40] amen
[1:32:48] good morning
[1:32:51] i walk
[1:32:53] by the river
[1:32:56] i'll rest me
[1:32:59] the ever
[1:33:01] green tree
[1:33:05] i'll carry
[1:33:07] my cross
[1:33:09] through the midnight
[1:33:13] come morning
[1:33:15] there's glory
[1:33:18] for me
[1:33:21] sometimes i'm
[1:33:23] despised
[1:33:25] and rejected
[1:33:28] and i question
[1:33:30] oh father
[1:33:33] how long
[1:33:36] then i take one
[1:33:38] more look
[1:33:40] at mount calvary
[1:33:44] and it gives me
[1:33:46] the strength to
[1:33:48] go on that tree
[1:33:51] come morning
[1:33:53] i'll walk
[1:33:55] by the river
[1:33:58] i'll
[1:33:59] rest me
[1:34:01] the ever
[1:34:03] green tree
[1:34:06] i'll carry
[1:34:08] my cross
[1:34:11] through the midnight
[1:34:14] come morning
[1:34:16] there's glory
[1:34:19] for me
[1:34:22] just think about it church
[1:34:24] what have we been there sitting there
[1:34:29] and i'm serious to ask you peter was
[1:34:32] sitting there
[1:34:34] james
[1:34:36] john
[1:34:39] but they never explained to communion
[1:34:44] you know
[1:34:45] you know they took it you know they've
[1:34:46] done
[1:34:47] but they never explained it
[1:34:52] and paul
[1:34:54] was writing a letter you know because
[1:34:56] that's what his writings were were
[1:34:57] letters to people
[1:34:59] and somebody had probably asked him a
[1:35:01] question
[1:35:03] and said paul
[1:35:06] uh
[1:35:07] this communion
[1:35:10] you know we we'd like to know a little
[1:35:12] more about it
[1:35:15] so he sat down and he started pinning
[1:35:17] and a lot of things had been told him
[1:35:20] that it took place
[1:35:23] and he could write that down
[1:35:26] but then he could see within his own
[1:35:28] self what it really was
[1:35:30] and how that what they were doing back
[1:35:32] here
[1:35:33] would come down to here
[1:35:36] and the prophet said when we get on that
[1:35:38] other side
[1:35:39] the marriage supper
[1:35:41] said
[1:35:42] it's going to be the communion
[1:35:47] well we always thought it would be a big
[1:35:48] porterhouse steak with a
[1:35:51] this thing or that thing you know
[1:35:54] we thought it'd be some kind of
[1:35:55] something
[1:35:57] the greatest meal that could ever be
[1:35:58] thought of
[1:36:01] i told you when we were in israel
[1:36:03] i'm always the last one to kind of know
[1:36:06] things and
[1:36:07] a little dumb you know and a little
[1:36:09] backward but
[1:36:10] we had a nice meal before we left israel
[1:36:14] and uh
[1:36:16] you know they had a lot of things to eat
[1:36:18] and then they had some lamb on the shish
[1:36:21] kebabs
[1:36:23] well i thought that was the main meal
[1:36:26] so
[1:36:27] i ate all of my lamb
[1:36:30] and i don't remember but i know i looked
[1:36:32] around to brother dean and sister peggy
[1:36:34] and maybe to my wife and
[1:36:37] they didn't eat all of theirs
[1:36:38] they were smart enough to know we was
[1:36:40] going to get something else but i didn't
[1:36:42] and i didn't intend to go home hungry
[1:36:46] and and i said to them i said the bible
[1:36:48] says to eat the whole lamb
[1:36:51] you know
[1:36:52] so
[1:36:53] they faced it down and
[1:36:57] i ate all of their lamb
[1:37:00] then they brought the main meal out
[1:37:03] which was a fish about this long
[1:37:07] about that white
[1:37:10] i got it down
[1:37:14] but you see
[1:37:17] take it off
[1:37:18] let's eat all the word
[1:37:22] let's think about all the word right
[1:37:23] let's protect together
[1:37:34] you can be seated for a moment and then
[1:37:36] we'll
[1:37:41] go into the foot washing
[1:38:01] think about it
[1:38:03] what about it
[1:38:06] john 13.
[1:38:08] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:38:10] now put into the heart of judas's carrot
[1:38:12] simon's son to betray him
[1:38:16] jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:38:17] all things into his hands
[1:38:20] that he was come from god and went to
[1:38:22] god
[1:38:24] he rises from supper and laid aside his
[1:38:26] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:38:27] himself
[1:38:28] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:38:30] and began to wash the disciples feet
[1:38:33] and to wipe them with a towel wherewith
[1:38:35] he was girded
[1:38:37] then cometh he to simon peter and peter
[1:38:39] said unto him lord
[1:38:42] let's not wash my feet
[1:38:45] jesus answered and said unto him
[1:38:47] what i do thou knowest not now
[1:38:50] but thou shalt know hereafter
[1:38:53] peter saith unto him
[1:38:56] that shall never wash my feet
[1:38:59] see he didn't have an understanding of
[1:39:00] what was going on
[1:39:02] right
[1:39:06] peter said unto him thou shalt never
[1:39:07] wash my feet jesus answered him if i
[1:39:10] wash thee not now that's no part with me
[1:39:13] simon peter saith unto him lord
[1:39:15] not my feet only but also my hands and
[1:39:18] my head
[1:39:19] two dirtiest things about us right
[1:39:22] jesus saith unto him
[1:39:24] either is washed needeth not saved to
[1:39:27] wash his feet
[1:39:29] but he's clean ever wit
[1:39:31] and you're clean
[1:39:32] but not all for he knew who should
[1:39:34] betray him therefore said he
[1:39:37] you're not all clean
[1:39:38] so after he had
[1:39:40] washed their feet
[1:39:42] and had taken his garments and was set
[1:39:44] down again
[1:39:46] he said unto them
[1:39:47] no you what i've done to you
[1:39:50] you call me master
[1:39:51] and lord
[1:39:53] and you say well for so i am
[1:39:56] if i then your lord and master have
[1:39:58] washed your feet
[1:40:00] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:40:02] feet
[1:40:03] for i have given you an example
[1:40:05] that you should do as i have done to you
[1:40:07] verily verily i say unto you
[1:40:10] the servant is not greater than his lord
[1:40:13] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:40:15] that sent him
[1:40:17] if you know these things
[1:40:19] happier ye if you do them
[1:40:22] let's stand together and the sisters can
[1:40:24] be dismissed in the basement and
