back home today we pray that you would just guide each and every one of us have your way forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and just keep us by thy Grace in Jesus name amen Romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren more over whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us we don't have to worry do we all right Revelations 13 verse 8-10 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in The Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear let him here because it's a truth we believe it but now watch this too he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kth with a sword must be killed with a sword here is the patience and faith of the Saints you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been covering and was covering this past uh Wednesday and been covering for quite a while that when Paul said you know there in in Romans he said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and he said how can they hear without a preacher well that puts it in a good category because we believe God has ordained a five-fold Ministry to carry the message on that the prophet has brought unto us right now but it doesn't stop there it says how can they preach unless they be sent now do you realize what we would be doing do you realize what people do that are uh not sent of God to preach what would they preach they they can't preach the truth if they're not sin of God all right so then that's why I read that scripture it said he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity and if you kill with a sword you must be killed with a sword all right now if I take my own ideas and try to express to you my ideas know see then I will lead you into captivity and I'll go into captivity to that thought myself amen all right now if that's true then we can truly see then it that it's right that that how can they hear without a preacher but how can he preach unless he be sent all right because if he's not sin of God he'll bring his own ideas we'll read it in a minute where the Prophet says that you know talking about organization denominationalism see because every preacher that's standing in the pull pit today around the world is trying to sew a seed because that's what we're supposed to be doing all right but now if it's a hybrid seed which means anything mixed with is what you call a hybrid you know we're very familiar in our day of times of hybrid seeds you know and corn and different things cuz really you can't hardly get anything anymore that's original and even if you get the original that's not too original you know because it it's got problems and uh but yet a hybrid seed would produce a hybrid product and that's why you see then around the world you know all the different denominations right and then you see in this message how many uh swings and pulls and denominations there is you know it's man's ideas trying to speak about the word of God all right so now we ever there's there's not a preacher you wouldn't call nobody up and say you know any preacher anywhere uh are you going to se Bad Seed today oh no the Lord is telling me this well I didn't know the Lord was that vastly confused myself to where that he could just allow everybody to preach what they wanted to believe and that was what I was trying to get to point to you he brother around said stay with your pastor what come on as long as he stays with the word then what did he say do he said get away from it you know why because see if I lead into if if I do as a scripture says that and I try to lead into captivity I'll go into captivity and I'll lead you into captivity and that's where Jesus would say about the you know the Pharisees the preachers the things he said you know they stand in the door and said they won't go in and said they won't let the others go in that's right so then you're going to have to make a choice we need to make a get a clear decision in our mind you know and and get it settled to whether or not we believe see the truth if not then we need to move on that's I've never been nothing to try to get you to come to me I've always tried my best to preach the word and as I said a moment ago I've never heard a preacher yet say that he was going to get up and preach a lie have you I mean everybody's LED of the lord well that's sounds like Mass confusion but just remember what we were covering Wednesday night what the prophet said spoken words of regional seed he said the seed comes to the body The Germ he said comes to the body that's right all and he said you know talking about the angels and how they they would be you know come and tell Peter and them but it was Peter that carried the word the angel can't car the word now you're talking about there Heavenly form Angels not the word Angel using in the form of messenger Etc all right and in doing that then if the seed would to come through the body then I have a word to bring and I'm trying to preach to you the best that I can what I believe the word says and that's sewing a seed all right now it will only reproduce whatever the kind of seed that's planted right see that's why we all have to make our calling and election sure can you say well brother D I just can't find nobody I can agree with well that makes you a one person denomination right and now wait just a minute now how would you saying that well if I'm the only person that's got the truth that might be all right but I don't believe that I'm the only person that's got the truth I don't believe you're the only person that's got the truth so I we just become a denomination if we believe we have the truth and nobody else don't have it well people just don't understand me in my ways well tell me what you're saying in the Bible right amen and let's see whether it's in the word or not all right but you see then we know for assurity that Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word and how can we hear without a preacher right and how can he preach unless he be sent all right now in doing that then we believe we need Faith right true we believe we need Faith Revelation all right so then Revelation comes by hearing well no I didn't hear nobody I got this all by myself that's a one person denomination okay go ahead see because as I keep saying it to make sure you don't misunderstand me if you read the Bible that's what somebody said if you listen to The Prophet's message that's what somebody said all right so you're not getting it the Bible says everything we have we what we received all right so then it's totally dependent upon whether or not we can believe the seed of God has been sown we say we believe the prophet brought the message perfect and pure and unadulterated I agree I say that over and over but then he said the five-fold ministry was to take it and break it down to the people you know what gets me I'm just honest I'm plain and blunt all you know what gets me is when you say things like that talking about a five- full ministry you know the pro you know the ones that you have problems with preachers the ones that order to jump up and scream and say Amen you right cuz you're talking about them as preachers but instead of that it's you know down why cuz they don't believe believe you're called right they believe they're called that's all right I just say that I'm not trying to build a church I'm trying to my best to preach the gospel and doing that that I realized that I'm planting a seed and I must be very careful what I plant because if I plant my own ideas I will produce a hybrid church right right and I will become hybrid myself and that's no no problems with that all right I just try to be honest and sensible and try to get to you what I'm talking about see we know that the seed of God is the word of God right all right but we also know that if that word does not have the German of life it will not produce all right now as making a point uh we talk about hybrids won't reproduce now we know what we're talking about we know what the prophet is talking about but you can plant corn as hybrid and next year you can plant that corn that you raised off of that it won't bring up beans it'll bring up corn right but it'll be deformed or you know perverted or whatever you want to call it well then can't we see that then if the preacher brings the word all right and that leans it to an organization or how hbd it'll bring forth a life or do you think all these organizations come from or you think all the denominations come from you know that every one of them claims to be based upon the word right well did the word produce that or was it some hybrid preacher preaching it that's right okay see you better know and we all talk about it being the end you better know what you're believing what you're listening to because the crop's going to be produced all right but now then we believe that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing comes by somebody preaching it to us we said well brother random brought it I'm just staying with that well goodbye go home stay there I'm not going to fuss with you about it but see my dependency is upon the word of God that has been made known to us by way of the Prophet right and then in that my dependence is upon the five-fold ministry to break break that down as he said to where that I can understand it all right so I I believe that I'm in the right channel you know and uh but just think about it but do we really believe do we really believe that the preacher is to bring the word to us that's right amen you know do I mean do we really believe that and then do we put our whole confidence in that amen you know and we put our life upon it cuz you don't you know you realize whether you want to believe it or not your life is on the line being in the wrong ranks the prophet said at the Rapture or something paraphrasing it would be no excuse all right but see we've got to find the word and rally around the word amen amen all right now in doing that then we're in the same shape as we'll read in a minute that down Through the Ages down Through the Ages the prophet said the word was sown in each age right right but see when Martin Luther came along with the message of the just shall live by faith did the religious World believe him no but you know what don't make no difference he was right and they was wrong right when this Prophet com and brought us a message did the religious World accept it no but you know what he was right they was wrong he says you can't denominate this message why cuz you're not going to see a sign over the church it says we are the brandom Tabernacle uh denomination but he said you can organize it in the lady of sea all right when when you organize what happens you immediately die because organization is hybrid religion watch that now as we go along Faith then must come by hearing and hearing must come by somebody preaching it to us and that's word it I don't I don't have any problems I try to tell the truth that way you sisters has got something to do with it too you know right right well you got your own family your own pull pits your own kids all right and see then we can sit down and talk with one another you know we don't make the women like back in the early days that we were coming along you'd have meeting type of things and before the meeting got together you may go to a home or whatever but when they did the men went into one room the women had to go in the other room they were not allowed to mingle together well I've got a problem with that because I knew a lot of sisters there that could help those preachers if they'd listen to them you I'm honest but do you think they's going to listen no ain't no woman going to tell me well there was a few in the Bible that CED the gospel you know and see why would we worry about it so then Faith cometh by hearing you women Teach Your Kids Teach Your Kids The Gospel the truth all right then you won't have to worry about it why because what's your you're doing sisters is you're doing this like any preacher you're sewing a seed all right brothers that are not ministers you have a right to go out and talk to people about the gospel and try to help them right why because it's a part of you okay and why don't why don't we accept it that way and say thank you Lord now you just help me to make sure that I find find the word and rally around it see then that way we don't have to worry about it because you know it is the preaching of the Gospel we know that Jesus Christ the son of man was the only s of the seed see didn't brother randam wasn't the son of man he was a son of man that the son of man used to swow the seed in the end of the entire Bible so we believe it but yet what are we doing here today if it's not for trying to find a revelation right what's our purpose of gathering in a church or whatever is to hear right all right see then and realize then that the prophet said The Germ the seed comes through the body I wasn't the one that wrote the book I wasn't the one that preached the message he said the 5old Ministries for the perfecting of the Saints that's what the Bible says but how can they preach unless they be sent all right so then make sure what you're listening to right well that that that brother he's doing good but he's a little off well what in the world would you want to listen to that far then if you know he's a little off you that's right well brother D I believe you're a little off back the room is back there after the service we'll take all the time we can to sit down and talk to you about it you know but see I believe then that the gospel must be preached right but part gospel you can't get a birth of the word why is it that now come on are you with me all these churches around the world whatever they are Brites lul I who right or denominations or whatever there's a lot of churches today that will have multitudes of conversions right now do you believe they're getting the new birth I believe it's possible for them to I go that way but I believe it's very rare don't you right well now you can't preach a trinity and get a new birth you would birth a trinity that's not the gospel you see why it's so important to preach the truth amen all right and see Let It Be then the the seed that you're sewing cuz I tried to make it plain when I was saved a seed without a germ of life in it is no good all right then there can't be a germ of life in a denominational Creed right come on well if it's part truth what are you going to get you're going to get a hybrid cuz it's not the truth right amen well you think you're the only one I didn't say that I've always taught you that I believe the word is being taught around the world that's right I believe that the truth I never have believed everybody's going to say cat and the guy over in Africa says cat and one in India says cat I never believed like that but I believe the god that can reveal reveal the word to me and you can reveal it to anyone else that'll make theirself available all right see because it's the gospel the Bible says the gospel is what the power of God under salvation what now paraphrasing scriptures but close to them that believe let it believe the truth you remember how I tried to preach on that back under in the series one time about that Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free he didn't say you had to know about the truth the truth is the only thing that can give a new birth that's right part truth can't bring a new birth all right so you see where we're at in what we're thinking the gospel must be preached all right and see then it once it's preached we were listening to the tape last night and brother around said when that life member comes in he said then the lamb can leave The Mercy Seat of course everybody believed that was 63 didn't it or 77 or whatever but we're still here all right so there must have been something wrong WR there okay but think about it now if it's a gerti seed it will produce so you take a grain of corn if it's gerti put it in the ground do correctly water with it what moisture and it it'll produce right but if it's not gerti what's wrong it won't come up right so in the gospel if we are preaching the truth the truth will produce and see when it produces it will prove that it's gerti all right you see why I spent so much time with Jesus said my words are Spirit in their life he said other words you said my words are gerti now any true min any girl woman man woman whatever if you're taking the truth to somebody you can only take what's been revealed to you all right but yet you can take that and speak to others about it right and they have the ability to receive why because it's a gerti seed see Luther could preach to the people about justification why because he'd experienced it Wesley could preach of sanctification he experienced it right Pentecostal Zeus Street could preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because they had experienced it but according to the scripture if it's not God revealing it then it's not no good no matter how much we know about it what's that in a minute when we read but you see I'm trying my best to get us to see what happened and how that the prophet would say that we come here with a seed in us well I'll be glad when you get around to preach on that if I was you I wouldn't sleep you might find out one of these days I walk out here and say I'm through with that series I'm not going to preach anymore on predestination but I thought she was going to explain it to us 56 sermons explaining it right I wouldn't wait around you know if I was you I would listen and ask God to speak and see if it's the truth or not and if I don't tell you what the prophet says come tell me but don't come to me now see that's where people don't like it that's why they don't come in the office see if I leave it like that people I'm coming but then I say don't come with a little silly sugar tit ideas I believe it's like this brother Dale I don't give a hoot what you believe I hope you don't give a hoot what I believe I hope that what I'm basing is on the word and you can believe what the word says now that's what I'm wanting sir well you don't think we got a right no no we don't we're not we don't have a right to believe anything we want to that's right cuz we're sheep we buar wool you want to manufacture It Go believe what you want to all right well let's listen to the prophet talking a little bit and just remember I wouldn't wait around on a message to explain predestination I would try to comprehend what's being said let's start out on something the prophet said about these things cuz we get to it today what I want to do is ask you some questions all right and when to ask you what kind of if you say I believe I come here with a seed in me then when was it put there and what is the seed that was put there and where was it placed I think I have a right to ask that yeah but I you you just make it too complicated brother random said it and I'll read it in a little bit he said I'm not doing this to try to start a doctor and he said I'm doing this to straighten it out going ahead and pull up number one brother and let's start this is on the mark of the beast 1956 7:15 paragraph or e48 and look what he says your heart is a womb and the womb holds the seed okay typing natural showing spiritual right and the seed is the gospel now the seed alone in its heart no matter how many gas you set under are you reading no matter how many great how no matter how great your pastor is and how much you've read the Bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it okay higher higher wake them up maybe I need to do yeah okay I I'm running back here sister Gil said I need to do that at once in a while but look what he says he said it don't matter you know what what gamea what he was the greatest teacher of all right no matter if you set under him other words if you set under the prophet's message right no matter how much your pastor is how much you read the Bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it right a woman seed is a wonderful thing it's the building of a body you know the egg builds the body right that don't give it life come on go the m has to do says but it has no life it can't it's impossible it has no life to begin with so no matter no matter how much you know the Bible how well it is in your heart you're still a sinner okay now what happens okay the heart is a womb and Faith cometh by an open ear that's not not been sealed by theology okay you see why a lot of people don't get the new birth Faith cometh by hearing to hear the word comes into the mind you make up your mind about it is this right could it be right that's up here in this plane we call a head right brain thinking it over you make up your mind about it is that right could that be right well the Bible said so I believe it now what we down into the heart it goes now then it's a womb so at least we could do like the disciples the disciples finally come to a place in their mind right that they said you have the words of eternal life where can we go that's right and watch you say I believe it he says we you know down into the heart it goes then it's a womb then the male sex we are the bride the woman the seed goes into the church then the male sex which is the blood sail the blood of Christ is applied and in the blood comes a germ of life that goes into the seed and it brings forth a newborn baby crying out by father now he's not talking about a natural seed because when you take a natural seed it's already got to have the germ in it right right he's talking about the preaching of the Gospel the truth right it comes in a germ that goes into the seed and brings forth a newborn baby crying ABA father ABA father my God my God why did I ever do those things my God my God there you are see the seed then has to be planted and that's what I'm trying to do see you've read the word right but see I'm trying to stir that up to get you to see there's a life that goes for that all right right see then you say I believe it right it can go down into your heart once you say with your mind your brain that I believe it but where's our trouble act in the brain where that he said and by faith cometh by an open ear that's not been sealed by theology now come on like brother Tom one time he took back to the Methodist Church he was in and he tried to present water baptism to the pastor you know that had taught him and when the pastor finished he said brother Tom said well now what you going to do about it he said I have to stay with with the church doctrine right right see even in his human brain that he couldn't argue about the water baptism but in his human mind something had done been sealed out you see that's why I believe in speaking to Soul I don't believe in speaking to brains and bodies brains and bodies don't work too good that's why I spend all the time talking about the soul and what it is brains and bodies will argue with you all the time yeah but I believe it's it I believe it's that I believe it's it but if you can get down into the inside the prophet said souls in prison he said if you get down into that inside and get that soul to agree with it he said that soul to die why cuz is going to be reborn all right and see that's all I'm trying to do is to ignite whatever you want to call it spark within us the word that we've heard that's all I'm trying to do now look what he says in the next message Young unchangeable God 1960 328 or 3:26 E7 and Jesus said the word is a seed that a sore sold and a seed if it's gerti and it goes into the ground then that seed under the right conditions of the Sun and moisture will bring forth the life that's in the seed and so is the word of God if a person can take that word and place it in their heart and give it to right sunshine not in your head right the right temperature not Su n but s o n and right temperature of faith in there that seed and promise will live to you just like it did at the beginning to the one it was given to because it's God's word and he is the same yesterday today and forever he cannot fail now why then was they even Jesus seen a 500 Brethren after his resurrection but only 120 made the upper room at least 380 people saw him after he raised nail prints in his hands side everything right where where were they at something in their mind kept them from going with the rest of them and even we know the story of the 120 in the upper room that they were having problems about remaining there right that's right is that the way your Prophet said it and one of them said let's go I think we got it we just take it by faith amen so they wasn't sitting up there everybody as we read it in one mind and one Accord then they come along make jokes out of it and say they cross the desert in a Honda because it was all in one Accord people are going to find out that's blaspheming one of these days but you see church maybe we might find out we're blaspheming right God what are we doing with the word take that word let it go down in and then let the spirit Quicken it that's right I can't Quicken it I can only sow seed right the gospel if it's a gerti seed now look what he says can happen though when a germatize seed as I go ahead to the next as I said a moment AG go the absolute 63 127 as I said a while ago you take a hybrid corn you plant it it comes up it's pretty good I love it it's good food right love take that old car you CU it's good well you know if you take it in one respect you you're making it wrong brother asked me something this morning he's that his so I said well you got part of it right that's what I said cuz he didn't have it right all right now when brother Brown says a hybrid seed can't reproduce you better keep listening he tells you it will only produce a warped up fruit right right he's not telling you you can't plant that hybrid seed and it produ that well it'll come up but it'll look like popcorn or something well think about it what are we doing with the word now which what he says you want to see something but now how can God ever watch over his word to vindicate and the person disbelieve in that word and won't receive it in their heart how can you do it how can the sun shine upon a seed and bring it to life when it hasn't got any life in it it's got to be a germatize seed so a Creed is gerti to make more members right now are we right you thought a grain of corn what are you trying to do no I'm trying my best to explain what he's talking about right you plant that hybrid corn it will reproduce but what will it reproduce a hybrid condition right look what he says how how can you do for it's got it's got to be a gerti seat so a Creed is gerti to make more members look but the word of God is gerti to make more Saints make Believers right not make believers make us Believers right that's right and God works to perform his word he watches over it to vindicate it yes sir so then is it possible for you and I to take a seed and believe it's beautiful and then when it reproduce What happens when you hybrid something right you hybd it you you take many and you put it together right to keep coming down okay I don't know the formula I'm just saying they may have took big old corn old corn we used to eat you know and they mated it together with popcorn maybe and they come out with some beautiful corn and no but you take that and plan it it's going to try to go back to where it started from right but it can't go back it doesn't have the ability to to do it you keep planing it it'll just die why because it doesn't have the ability to go back where it come from all right so you take my ideas and your ideas upon the word of God and we pervert the word of God and it cannot produce the or seat you said well brother Dale why don't you just tell us what you're talking about okay I will you say I believe I come here with a seed in me where was it at when was it put there you know that's all the questions I'm asking well question gender Strife yeah and they generally make a nut look like one too right but listen think about it go ahead number four there's a man here that can turn on the light 63 1229 the morning service plant the wheat out there and it'll put it in the basement cover it over and it'll never bring forth anything because it can't there's no light there but as soon as the light strikes it then it it'll bring forth if it's a gerti seed that's the same thing it is in the word see the word is God and when the LI strikes it it brings it life strikes it it brings the word to life again every age has always been that oh how we appreciate these great things and how that the word being Vindicated is the light of the spoken word every age I said about Luther when he preached the he was probably preach sermons on the J you live by faith it didn't Quicken a lot of other people were talking about it too you know we want to just put it on one person whatever there was a lot of go back and study your history part of it there was a a lot of people protest in the Catholic Church before Luther ever come along right right that's right see we don't just make it one thing was no there was a lot of it why because there was things trying to spring up but they couldn't do any good why because they still had their own ideas when Luther caught that to just you live by faith that was the seat of that age it was not hybrid you said but he was a trinitarian part of baptism was wrong sure it was but that don't mean anything about the seed that he planted he planted that justification for that day pure and unadulterated amen because it was the seed of God so is every age if it's a gerti seed but now suppose at the same time Luther was preaching that just shall live by faith uh brother Donnie was talking to us yesterday said there's a big preacher on the radio and said he said the reason my church is growing I Don't Preach against sin you know what I think of I I shouldn't say what I think a lot of times but you know what I think of I think of the day brother R said prostitution went up last year he said it is is it of God that's his word you think your Prophet don't talk right but that was his words but you see church we look at that and we say that's wrong but we then defend people who are just a little bit off well that's their way of seeing it what's the difference in a little bit a whole lot most of the time the whole Lots can be helped the ones with a little bit can't because they won't admit it all right but think about it we think well we we was born with this seed in us well why was it it made alive and now they're saying that the new birth is all it is is just a a knowledge comes to you you know you you just get a knowledge that you're born again well the disciples was with Jesus three and a half years they had a pretty good knowledge of what he's talking about right but did that Quicken the word look at the next one spoken words Original Seed 62 318 paragraph 254 really 255 or 265 excuse me when it fell on those seeds Jesus said he chose them when before the foundation of the world then there were a predestinated seed now he's talking about the upper room experience right is that right congregation said amen then had here they haul themselves up into the upper room these seeds the word and the Word was laying on there without life in it go what you want to all of a sudden there came a sound from Heaven as the waters began to rush down and it actually filled all the house where and they were sitting and the seeds begin to grow it began to manifest itself the word of God being manifested right but yet he said it was laying there without life and I'll go ahead and say it this way cuz I know that the way most people preach it about the seed laying there they say the seeds laying in you dormant now I want a quote for that there's like 20 times maybe a little more of the times brother brandham uses the word dormant but you won't find him saying the seed was laying in you dormant I want to quote because people say the brother around said this I've heard it over and over brother R said you always was eternal I want a quote where it says you always was eternal I'm putting it out to you put it out on the internet put it out anywhere but yet we sympathize well well brother you just don't understand I know it I know I don't understand I'm a dummy but I'm trying to tell the truth amen if nothing else let me be the dumb donkey he told the prophet the truth did he that's right saved the prophet's life all right but think about it we'll just put it right here here's a favorite quote go ahead with number 5 a I added this in after when you hear me 4 a 5 a that means I put it in her later you know but I thought you know a lot of people say I come into this world with a seed in me and they'll say I I don't need nothing because always was eternal but just look at what the prophet is saying that's right see we're so revelated until we just put in anything we want to as I told you they used to say the soul is just the nature of the spirit there is no quote for that the quote is soul is the nature of the spirit when you say just the nature of the spirit you're just making it like a bird dog a cat or any kind of a something it's not there but yet preachers say that and it's captivated the minds of the people and they took a denominational hybrid seed that's why I warn you be careful what you listen to Just remember now if you're listening to something and that goes in that mind and drops down in it'll become part of you and you're going to have to kill it or it'll produce another two Souls doctor or whatever right yeah like one man I heard him say what you call it two Souls y to this what I believe well then he turned around and said exactly what the two Soul Doctrine was well but you see we're making it so what so let's read this of what the prophet says you always was saved I don't mind taking what the things he said CU I believe them right and and there was a day I wouldn't have D read that to you and tell you I understand cuz I didn't and there's no need of lying about it but what did he say this is taken to the Future home 64802 paragraph 232 there is your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal things it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with ET etal life with the predestinated that never did start I agree with that 100% predestinated never started it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved right well let's go home right if that's what you believe you might as well go home and forget it cuz you're wasting time money coming do it and you know that's what's preached by the biggest portion of the message now you don't believe it click on the internet you was always saved now then you don't need Jesus you don't need salvation and as I said if the new birth is what people thinks that it's just a knowledge that we're children of God then Jesus didn't have to die cuz Nicodemus heard it straight well we we've heard it straight by the prophet right so we don't need to be saved now I want you to show me a quote where he said you don't need to be saved there's a lot of difference in saying you don't need to be saved and saying you are always saved vast difference right in the statement well brother D let just one saying this way other saying now it's all the same well then you don't need salvation you don't need Jesus you spent your whole life in vain go home eat drink and be merry cuz if he always saved you don't even need to listen to The Prophet no more you done got the knowledge it always say Jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning beginning when the predestination took place you saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with he said well brother Dale that's vastly confusing to me but that's what most people believe that you had eternal life to begin with now H how many remembers in this series that I spent about four Services preaching on where the Prophet said if you have eternal life right you always was eternal right and that you cannot sin why because his seed remaineth in you and you cannot sin now he didn't say you didn't sin to start with cuz he said we was all Sinners that's right and he said we was all lost sir now go ahead you don't need a preacher to straighten that out right you got your own idea but check all the quotes we'll give you a few but check all the quotes about eternal life see I believe the eternal life that you have today always was eternal that's right but I believe there was a day we didn't have it that's right it was not a possession to you and I right it was in God's mind that's right amen so now you see where we're going with the seed if we get TI it'll be this evening where was the seed put our brother brother said put there before the foundation of the world Amen now be careful you'll go back to your Mormon doctorine see pre-existence but think about it if you are saved today which means eternal life now not just we're repented we're accepted Jesus Christ we're you know we're just kind of believing no no no no no no no talking about that okay if you truly believe you have eternal life in your soul then I can say your soul always was eternal that's by the eternal life right not because I was born with it right but somebody walk up here today and say and they really repent and want and they receive eternal life right here that person is just as Eternal in Soul as they'll ever be do you agree with that amen right well that eternal life had no beginning and I could tell the person then hey can you catch it you always was eternal but you bring somebody up here that ain't got the Holy Ghost in their heart to interpret that and you tell them they always was eternal and you watch the garbage cans that come out of it and you see them in this message right polygamy beamies hiams homosexualities perversions right in this message people oh I believe everything the prophet said won't you just be honest like a man was riding down the road I won't call his name but brother random was saying something to get something and his wife said see there brother Brown don't agree want you he just took the tape out slung it back he said ain't no man going to tell me what to believe why don't you be honest enough to do it it's like I told a man at my house one day you've heard me tell it but he said too much and I looked at him I said why don't you get out of the message or get in one you know what his wife said you're right brother tail do you think that converted him no no uhuh listen if you have eternal life go ahead let's read to it three fast all right number six taking from Ser we would see Jesus 64304 most of these are after The Seals some back and forth so you so he knew what he's talking about there he knew what he's talking about for the seal right just in case some people oh he got a revelation later you know that's what they're saying they're saying the new birth is no longer justification same Cas the baptism and the Holy Ghost brother random got a revelation later it was just a baptism right then you get upset with me for bringing out people's doctrines and think I'm against the people no I love everybody but I hate a garbage can I was drug out of it I know what it was I know what to take my own ideas and what I can do with it but also know there's a bride of Jesus Christ yes sir listen now if you were in his thinking at the beginning what if you got eternal life there's only one form of eternal life eternal life had no beginning and has no ending so if you have eternal life you were an attribute of God's thinking before there was anything but him that's how you have eternal life your form your shape and what you you're in now is just a negative right when you come up to around 20 23 the picture is taken in the certainly Tabernacle we have one already waiting what is eternal life go ahead number seven this is taken from who is this Mel chdc paragraph 48 notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him were in his thinking that doesn't say anything about us being back our little early does it before there was an angel star cherim or anything that's Eternal and if you have eternal life you always was right not your being here but the shape and form of the infinite God what are we you see you've been through these a lot brother Dale I know it let's read a couple more and then we'll quit and we'll take up this evening look at the next one wisdom versus Faith this and is 62401 cuz I believe he back there here I believe he knew what the truth was now if you have eternal life today you are in God what by God's being in you is that a sensable you're God's expressed thought we then don't listen to any reason lest your crown be taken and give to another don't take any reasons at all just believe what God Said is the truth and stay with it get the next one the voice of the sign 64 321 and there was a little woman a prostitute her her four life was up here up here was as black as it could be she was Ill famed but down in her heart she was predestinated to life he goes on explaining the things they were making fun and saying but she was saying I know when the Messiah cometh he said I'm he what did it do it cleaned out the Blackness and made it all white why there was a seed laying there a predestinated seed that was in the it was God's thought before the foundation of the world now I want to stop right there cuz this will be the thought we'll carry on this afternoon I just want to ask you simple question he said it made white it clinged out to Blackness made it all white right did she get the new birth right there is that the new birth he's talking about when Peter said by the anointing of the Holy Spirit th aren't the Christ the son of the Living God that was made alive to him wasn't it right did that give him the new birth no when the prophet spoke in the name of the Lord thousands of times of thus sayith the Lord and things were revealed to them did that give them eternal life I don't believe the little woman at the well went back to her prostitution job I'm not foolish but I do know one man that after he said th the Christ the son of the Living God that he winds up over our denying Jesus Christ and cursing while he's doing it don't look like too good of a candidate for a birth does it and I remember a little woman that was a carrier of the seed of God by saying be it unto me according to Thy word but she turns around and denies him being the Virgin birth you think she had the new birth I can quote it about her but I can also do it about Peter because Peter was one of them up in the upper room right so he had to go up there to get the new birth and he said now you women that say Mary is a mother of God he said she had to pull the upper room to get the Holy Ghost that's right not the 12 now she was then that 12 the upper room I'm talking about is the place where the Holy Ghost fell right but you see we say but but brother Dale I just believe we always was well what are you dealing with in God's thinking or in your thinking if we always was eternal we don't need eternal life poor Nicodemus he just couldn't understand all he had to do is accept what Jesus said right is that the way we preach it come on I've heard preachers preach the little woman at the well that seed Was Made Alive Heen but it didn't give her the new birth that's right now you argue the point why did she have to go to the upper room why did she have to get eternal life well she just went up there and found out she already had it that's good but that's them things that we read there a while ago of a hybrid Creeds you see if we have had come in the world with eternal life we don't need Jesus Christ that's right but brother Dale that's too simple that's just the way you do you I know it Ian you call me deep I call it simple simple things is truth if a equals b as brother hter used to say then that means b and a is of the same value right if you tell me you always was eternal then I'm going to tell you I don't believe it but if you tell me that God always was eternal I'm going to amen it it that's not a and b that's two different things well I'll just tell with what the prophet said that one poor brother told me one time he said I don't know whether I make it or not but said that Prophet said pray for my family he said I pray for his family all the time and he said I'm going to be there cuz I pray for his family I never tried to degrade that man down and and tell him that that wasn't right I I didn't do that cuz I'm I'm a human being you think I'm just constantly trying to destroy your Doctrine no I'm trying to save your soul who are you preaching to here you that just had that idea but if you always was eternal then you don't don't need anything else but if you believe you need a new birth then there's a lot in the word that's to be now some of you won't be here this evening so I'll go ahead and put in it of course you may watch it on the internet that's your business you may not so that's your business but you see I believe that we were not people before the foundation of the world right that's right not human beings not even spirits the prophet said we were only in God's mind now all I want to know is how to transmit that down to a human being you know if I transmit that down that well you always was eternal there's the quotes then you don't need Jesus all you needing far is to live in this world now see that's come on I told you 40 years ago 30 something 40 I said if you think the two Soul Doctrine is deceiving I said you wait till the day come I said they're going to get closer closer and closer and you look at it now like come on I'm honest a little bit arrogant a little bit hateful and a whole lot sarcastic but what about the word what about when Jesus said you must be born again if you're not born again you're lost that's right we quote a lot I'll end it with this come on Brothers we quote a lot of what brother R says but we think about it he said there's no such thing as a white black bird or a black white bird quote that a lot don't we but what was he saying think on these things let's Stand Together come on brother you say Brother D I just I'm listening to you I love to listen to you but you just don't make me feel right praise the Lord I didn't no feelings had anything to do with it yeah yeah but anything's not got life in it is dead if I'm staying with the word I believe that the life is in the word the only person that's going to kill is a person that don't agree with the word there is death think on these things we'll get to it this afternoon the prophet of God said that seed was put in you before the foundation of the world I agree with what he says amen but that's what I don't understand church I don't understand it I don't understand that a minister will stand up and take every quote right around and say and say come and show me bring your quotes and let's lay them down and let's talk about it to give you a quote that says you always was eternal when you're explaining that that would only could be in God's mind but yet who wants that that way no you'd rather have it twisted to make you feel like it feel like what go ahead what we got 3:20 let's sing anybody has an need your all is open i' like to stay here longer than man's a lot days and watch the fleeing changes make sure you know what you're doing make sure you know what you're listening to oh yes whether it be here or whether it be anywhere else see if it goes with the word like a man told me one day one day he said brother Dale you ain't nothing but a Baptist where I come from you wouldn't understand him unless you knew what he's talking about and I knew exactly what he's talking about brother said you better leave that Baptist alone with the word he said he'll rip you to pieces with it why cuz he dwells on that letter and the thoughts everything right in that word he just lays it in there and he can explain a lot of it that's what he told me he said you're just a Baptist you can just put it together and explain it well you know that didn't make me mad that man preached probably 10 or 15 years more here with me I throw him out cuz he thought that about me ask him one day I said brother for what do you think about me now he said well I got to admit it's a little more than just a Badness but you see he couldn't touch that word that's why when I preach I'm willing to listen to anybody oh yes but don't come and tell me I thank I want the word I want the prophet's message not my thought or your thought I want to see it come together from Genesis to Revelation godive I'm over that many of us are over that God's a lot of days and 70 years and there's a lot of us already over that right I'm believing that there's a whole lot of Heaven here to take NE there but Heaven is a revealed word Prophet said Heaven consists of the word can we believe it your dismiss pray one for another remember the service this evening Glory by I'll tell and sing Story there on high there with my dear Redeemer no more to die oh yes I live in Glory by and my want to be of service along the pilg way and lead the lost to Jesus as fervently I pray as day by day I travel I'll keep him every night and live with him forever in Glory by
