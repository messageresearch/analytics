[0:00] glam again but we will anoint the most
[0:04] holy now you know it took a profit it
[0:07] took run around to come and God tell him
[0:10] what that meant because man there's a
[0:12] lot of commentators like I said before I
[0:14] don't mind any of us doing research we
[0:18] should research okay I think you coming
[0:23] up the road today what why is 12 called
[0:25] and doesn't I don't know I'm gonna
[0:29] Google Mikey on find out though the last
[0:32] 12 tall the doesn't leave I know do you
[0:34] know you know what all your life
[0:36] somebody's told you the twelve was it
[0:38] does and then a baker's dozen is why 13
[0:40] that when you each one is still got 12
[0:42] alright so weird the doesn't come from
[0:45] that's why I'm saying about these words
[0:47] you let you google it find out pops it
[0:50] hey you know that how you know as you're
[0:52] out him hey you know what who made 12
[0:54] does is it a fact yeah obviously your
[0:59] right hand with most people are
[1:01] right-handed so God me so you're saying
[1:05] that they're writing the left hand
[1:07] people wrong
[1:09] left hands thank you it's a grouping of
[1:13] 12 that doesn't maybe one of the
[1:15] earliest primitive groupings perhaps
[1:17] because there's approximately a dozen
[1:18] cycles of the moon or months in the
[1:22] cycle of the year how about that huh how
[1:25] bad the reason i ask that was is because
[1:29] there's 12 hustle why did Jesus call 12
[1:33] why didn't he call 10 why did he have 12
[1:37] drive well must mean something besides
[1:41] just a dozen good to have our visitors
[1:45] with us today and good morning why did
[1:55] you miss the you miss the good songs
[1:56] when she sang sheep that song was not
[1:59] just a singing of a song that was a
[2:02] living of a song man bless my heart and
[2:08] my soul so what we're talking we were
[2:11] cool you got off on 12 we'll get back to
[2:13] the men but i was thinkin bout why
[2:14] didn't Jesus choose 12 people 12 tribes
[2:19] of Israel why not 13 when I hate month
[2:21] seven significance there's what I'm
[2:24] telling you about these dates and all
[2:25] there's a significance in Israel's time
[2:28] because there's not a dozen Gentile that
[2:32] were chosen yes man what a man but there
[2:35] was 12 because Jesus told him those when
[2:37] he turned in total he said you 12 will
[2:40] judge the twelve tribes of Israel so he
[2:43] chose twelve disciples so that's the 12
[2:45] problem is room now that the sample sure
[2:48] they were chosen in the Old Testament
[2:49] but they were the ones that carried over
[2:52] and brought the word to the New
[2:53] Testament I really enjoyed what Bell
[2:55] jewel was talking about this the wife's
[2:58] not service about old Ted looking at the
[3:00] old they were looking at the Old
[3:01] Testament Jesus and he came to New
[3:04] Testament Jesus and he was a young man
[3:06] he was not an old man like they saw him
[3:08] in the Old Testament he was the new it
[3:10] was a New Testament right for that
[3:12] really blessed my heart be saying well
[3:15] that's not significant well it is to me
[3:17] it is to me because it showed me one
[3:19] thing Jesus's body changed it wasn't an
[3:22] old body when
[3:23] come back out hey listen why did they
[3:26] not know him no I didn't you and he come
[3:28] among all of them in a room and he said
[3:29] hey Here I am fair night and they're
[3:31] like yeah he said touch me the only
[3:35] person that ever really knew jesus said
[3:37] 20 years old with his mother right right
[3:40] yeah and that was Mary Magdalene that
[3:42] the tourney were not married in his
[3:43] mother she didn't know him at 20 that's
[3:46] why she thought he's a little boy
[3:47] working in the garden thought he was a
[3:49] gardener I've object ID was a gardener
[3:51] yes well she but when he spoke it was
[3:54] that same voice that she had heard and
[3:57] she knew so it's in the days of the
[3:59] voice is not the vessel it's the
[4:01] voiceless right so seventy weeks are
[4:06] determined upon thy people who Jews and
[4:09] the holy city Jerusalem all right to
[4:13] finish the transgression number one to
[4:15] make an end of sins number two you make
[4:17] reconciliation for iniquity number three
[4:19] to bring in everlasting righteousness
[4:20] number for Philip division in prophecy
[4:23] number five and anoint the most holy
[4:25] number six now that has to happen inside
[4:28] of this bracket of 490 years to that
[4:35] right because that's the redemption of
[4:38] Israel seventy times seven seventy weeks
[4:42] are determined actually in the in the
[4:47] translation remember when we said weeks
[4:52] with seven so what you do is have 70 of
[4:57] sevens I don't know if I showed you that
[5:00] or not but in one commentator you did
[5:02] real good job because remember we went
[5:03] back to where Jacob full build Rachel's
[5:07] week seven years for the bottles of one
[5:11] week at seven years so 70 of sevens when
[5:15] we kiss is how long seven days
[5:17] one week to seven days naturally one
[5:20] week one week to seven days okay but one
[5:25] week equal seven years we saw what the
[5:27] Prophet showed us but he got went to the
[5:30] Bible and God because that's what Jacob
[5:32] he worked seven years he didn't work
[5:33] seven days he works seven years to
[5:36] fulfil Rachel's week okay so 70 of seven
[5:40] so seventy times seven is what 490
[5:44] alright so in 490 years God's going to
[5:49] take his role from from being a
[5:52] transgressor a center and having
[5:55] iniquity to bring it to bring in
[5:58] everlasting righteousness still at the
[6:00] vision and prophecy in an optimal
[6:01] totally that's all going to be finished
[6:03] in 490 years what the Bible says seventy
[6:10] times seven 490 right and we've showed
[6:13] according to the prophets message down
[6:14] according to the Bible according to the
[6:16] moon phase according to all history that
[6:19] this 483 years has been already
[6:22] fulfilled right because they know
[6:27] therefore and understand it from the
[6:29] going forth of the commandment to
[6:30] restore and to build jerusalem unto my
[6:34] side of the prince who that Jesus Christ
[6:37] shall be seven weeks and threescore
[6:41] what's 33 score three times two is six a
[6:45] sixty-two weeks night so you've got
[6:48] seven weeks and sixty-two weeks is how
[6:51] much 62 plus seven yep well 62 times
[6:58] seven is four and 34 sorry seven times
[7:00] seven is fourth coast seven seven weeks
[7:03] seven weeks seven of seven seven seven
[7:06] 649 then 62 of seventh is 434 so we got
[7:14] 483 years that's 49 plus 4 and 34 for 93
[7:19] years all right but what sixty-two weeks
[7:23] and seven week 69 that's not 70 a 69
[7:29] weeks
[7:31] hmm because I'm from from the restoring
[7:36] and building of Jerusalem which we we
[7:38] showed it was for 45 pieces when they
[7:40] come in finish the walls got all the
[7:44] Jerusalem together got the people
[7:45] gathered together that's right remember
[7:48] we showed that 445 be seen now for 445
[7:51] bc to ad 30 we showed that it was the
[7:55] closest we could get to 483 years ok so
[8:01] we're to this point right here when
[8:02] Jesus was killed why was he killed for
[8:06] you me and the Jew ok he died for
[8:11] everybody but he knew who would be saved
[8:13] a new would write like what the hell's
[8:15] talking about now on predestination in
[8:19] pornography the street shall be built
[8:25] again the wall even in trouble of times
[8:27] we saw that was done in 4 45 bc they
[8:29] finished the wall in 52 days we've got
[8:31] everything finished all right 445 bc 2
[8:35] 830 we show was 475 years then you
[8:39] convert it over into the 360-day
[8:41] calendar we went through all that I'm
[8:43] trying to back up a little bit for the
[8:44] Wonder here you come up to the close to
[8:48] 483 years and as we can get as human
[8:51] beings all right make on that door where
[8:55] today we're we're kind of like right
[8:58] here because like I said before the
[9:04] Israel sin was forgiven in Calvary but
[9:08] remember brother Ram said it wasn't
[9:09] apply that's why he had to preach about
[9:10] a pardon a partner's not a party unless
[9:13] it's accepted as a part right because
[9:16] the pardon when Jesus died he died two
[9:18] parties everybody everybody's ever born
[9:21] in his whole world he pardoned every one
[9:23] of them they just didn't accept that
[9:25] part okay so Israel Jesus died on the
[9:29] cross for what a Gentile bride but this
[9:33] is us this is Gentiles on here okay this
[9:35] is the gentle gentle ache
[9:43] this is Gentile this is the wild olive
[9:50] branch right wild branch so we were
[9:59] grafted in this is spoken of right here
[10:04] and after 62 weeks shall Messiah be cut
[10:11] off but not for himself the people of
[10:14] the prince that shall come little pink
[10:16] shall destroy the city on the sanctuary
[10:18] who was that Titus an 80 70 a Roman
[10:21] general Rome Gentile way in and totally
[10:26] destroy the temple coach Jesus told him
[10:28] he said there won't be one stone left on
[10:30] another one when he gets finished he's
[10:32] going to destroy it and he's gonna take
[10:33] everything back with him ok shall
[10:37] destroy the city and sanctuary and the
[10:38] end thereof shall be with the flood
[10:40] remember they circled around Jerusalem
[10:42] and killed everybody that was in the
[10:44] city blood run out the streets on the
[10:46] street all right and then the end of the
[10:48] war desolations are determined and
[10:51] that's where we're at right here right
[10:54] here see that little flap over time
[10:56] there's always a little lap over time
[10:58] even in your church agent right I don't
[11:02] just stop one and start another really
[11:04] the church age you should look like this
[11:06] on month you understand long time cuz
[11:10] brother Ralph starts with a lap over and
[11:11] that's what this is that's a lap oh
[11:13] that's why people like that's why I can
[11:16] understand people have Billy Graham FF
[11:18] bosworth people like that that really
[11:20] never accepted the message of the hour
[11:22] but they're born again believers cuz
[11:26] they're waiting the lap over they were
[11:28] coming out of one age we age was coming
[11:32] out but the people were still in this
[11:34] age remember brother brown folder one
[11:36] brother said all you you pay
[11:37] sir ok they were born in another eight
[11:40] yeah well that's why I believe that
[11:44] we're going to look in 1977 I believe
[11:46] that was what brother round was talking
[11:48] about as far as an ending of an age all
[11:51] right because 77 is the 70s Jubilee all
[11:55] right so we'll get into that but that's
[11:57] over here and get right about right here
[11:58] all right but i will keep reading he
[12:02] shall confirm the covenant with many for
[12:03] what 17 families are one year so there's
[12:11] one year left after the right to the
[12:15] church it says right there because we're
[12:17] not here when he that little he is who
[12:20] the Antichrist the Antichrist does not
[12:23] make a covenant I mean Christ does not
[12:26] make the Covenant and then break it God
[12:29] does not break the Covenant how could we
[12:32] depend on him if he broke his covenant
[12:33] but you can't depend on the devil he
[12:35] breaks covenants all the time oh I'll
[12:37] help you out I'll do come for you yeah
[12:39] you go do some fire I'll send you the
[12:41] hell but he shall confirm the covenant
[12:44] with many for one week now the property
[12:48] guy said we're not here when that
[12:49] covenants made so we're gone so it's got
[12:51] to be that we leave right here and
[12:53] there's one of sevens one of sevens left
[12:59] and in the midst of the week what's in
[13:02] the midst of the week 39 years he shall
[13:05] cause the sacrifice and the oblation
[13:06] decision for the overspreading of
[13:07] abominations he shall make it desolate
[13:09] even until the consummation and that
[13:12] determined shall be poured on this one
[13:14] we ain't got that for you now it's going
[13:16] to take a long time to piece that one
[13:17] out oh my gods grace we're gonna do it
[13:20] so right now we're at Calvary
[13:27] seventy weeks or determinable down
[13:29] people and follow policy to do six ain't
[13:31] finish the transgression where today
[13:34] transgress all right let's go and let's
[13:37] take you want to tell you what we'll do
[13:40] let's see if we can do it on here in
[13:43] that dearie arrow see party all right
[13:55] let's just read some of these things
[13:57] here that run around saying now this is
[13:59] paragraph 36 on a six-fold purpose if
[14:02] you want to read in your book now
[14:06] remember that is all that the journey of
[14:08] the Israelites will have on this earth
[14:10] joy seventy weeks are determined it's
[14:13] just determined that's always loved it
[14:15] to the Jews I pulled on people upon the
[14:19] holy city now this is the property God
[14:21] speaking therefore there's 70 weeks now
[14:23] don't miss it it will reveal from the
[14:25] time to the end of the Jews and also to
[14:28] the end of Jerusalem we're within the
[14:33] Jerusalem when Titus destroyed the city
[14:36] the city's the temple has never been
[14:39] built back since he destroyed it I spend
[14:41] two thousand years ago 80 70 right so
[14:45] it's never been built back so Jerusalem
[14:47] has never really oh sure they got
[14:48] Jerusalem Jerusalem common over there
[14:50] that's built and they have government
[14:52] and said that's not a real Jerusalem
[14:54] that's not a real Israel right that's
[14:57] not the Israel that he's speaking out
[14:59] right here right this is speaking of 144
[15:03] thousand and two but it 144,000 but
[15:09] these two prophets preached to them
[15:10] right and then he goes through I hope we
[15:16] get into it real good and deep so here
[15:18] we go let's keep on going
[15:26] number one you want to market get your
[15:29] pencil number one to finish the
[15:31] transgression that's the first thing I
[15:32] the finish the transgression of Israel
[15:35] who transgressed against God will be the
[15:38] turning away of the ungodliness
[15:40] objective now we read that this would
[15:41] stop that last Sunday all right now to
[15:45] find this let's turn to Romans we did
[15:47] that last week this is paragraph 42 in
[15:49] that book if you want to read it or you
[15:51] can read around here what's he talking
[15:55] about these time by bringing in grafting
[15:59] in man again right because what did he
[16:02] do there'll be a time that when the
[16:06] Gentiles will be cut out Israel come
[16:07] back it's talking about putting the wild
[16:09] branch in and taking that branch back
[16:11] out well what's he going to do he's
[16:13] going to take this branch interactor
[16:15] mm-hmm he's gonna take this Gentile
[16:18] branch in a rapture where's the Gentile
[16:20] branch we're going we're going to be
[16:22] taking out but we're going to be taking
[16:24] up then what's he going to do he's going
[16:27] to come right back and do the same thing
[16:29] he was going to do had they not turned
[16:30] him down he gonna start dealing with
[16:32] them again through to profits after the
[16:35] rapture takes place all right and Israel
[16:39] come back in again for now we're cut out
[16:41] of the olive tree which is wild by
[16:43] nature Gentile and we're grab contrary
[16:46] to nature we were contrary to nature
[16:48] anything even without mercy without
[16:50] going with no hope God by His mercy give
[16:53] us a chance cut off Israel because of
[16:55] their transgression we're right here cut
[16:58] them off and brought into idolatry us
[17:01] right okay everybody got that I think
[17:04] that's pretty simple that week so was
[17:05] just going guys until God is finished
[17:10] with the Gentile paragraph 43 Israel was
[17:12] blinded so for all these years right
[17:14] hair Israel has been blinded okay that
[17:20] we might be grafted in you get it so all
[17:24] Israel shall be saved now that's not all
[17:27] Israelis understand that that's not all
[17:30] Israelis that's all Israel
[17:33] looking at Israel he's looking at
[17:36] 144,000 and that's it all right God
[17:40] blinded them purposely for you and I
[17:42] they cannot see because God blending and
[17:44] all israel what true it for him shall be
[17:48] safe all right all right finish the
[17:52] transgression of Israel I've come to
[17:54] tell you there's a time when israel's
[17:56] transgression will be finished how about
[18:01] the poor miserable people over there
[18:02] let's just keep going see right here he
[18:10] will come to Mount Zion one of these
[18:11] days upon the Mount of Olives they'll
[18:13] recognize him and all Ezra won't know
[18:15] it's him what through the two prophets
[18:17] the Gentiles will be finished in
[18:19] there'll be no more Gentile saved after
[18:21] we go on a rapture okay now there'll be
[18:24] some that will be given eternal life for
[18:26] their stand of the gospel foolish virgin
[18:29] cup of water and all that but they got
[18:31] to go through the tribulation and die
[18:33] and then all right I mean that's just
[18:35] simple teaching that we've had since
[18:36] we've you know definitely coming to
[18:38] message I go away yup real quick the
[18:43] question was that's media today about
[18:45] how God looks at Israel right now and
[18:49] because he considered for example what
[18:51] you were just saying
[18:52] the current government and the Prime
[18:54] Minister and all that was still think I
[18:56] told them I said well they are in God
[18:58] that considers what he gave Moses in the
[19:01] law and the 10 my worship and all that
[19:03] stuff that's true Israel but I'm hoping
[19:06] to but I see what please he still honors
[19:09] people like Benjamin Netanyahu and some
[19:11] of those who are the leaders but if
[19:13] they're not born again at this point
[19:15] right they're sinners come on now yeah
[19:21] God's not going to save Israel as a
[19:23] nation shoulders this is what I'm trying
[19:25] to say that's a good point we'll stop
[19:27] here from any engagement night Netanyahu
[19:30] there's no way he's going to save the
[19:33] nation of Israel that's right right the
[19:37] nation of Israel is treated to me almost
[19:39] often almost like America oh yeah
[19:42] because we saw Americanize them over
[19:44] there ok so the nation of Israel is not
[19:49] going to be saved but now God will bless
[19:50] that nation that blesses him see there's
[19:53] still that Orthodox Jew there's still
[19:55] the ones that believe in one true and
[19:57] living God and God will bless them
[19:59] whether they're part of the hundred
[20:01] forty-four thousand or not okay I mean
[20:07] that's that's what that's what God to me
[20:09] is is the reason that see even God said
[20:12] well I'll bless whoever blesses Israel
[20:15] that's why he's kept the United States
[20:17] up as much as he has because we're
[20:20] helping is we're about doing one damn
[20:22] we're not doing it now but see remember
[20:24] he's got to come to a point where nobody
[20:26] stands for Israel except God himself so
[20:30] the president administration and all the
[20:33] other ones that's coming or going that
[20:35] has turned Israel down that's just it
[20:37] just puts the bombs over an hour
[20:39] o'farrell over on our soil yeah really i
[20:45] mean so because everybody when we come
[20:47] to to get to this last week where the
[20:49] value of Armageddon begins that's
[20:51] everybody against Israel everybody north
[20:55] south east and west everybody will come
[20:57] pass throughs limited and fight but the
[21:00] Bible says Michael Michael standing
[21:04] fight for Israel
[21:05] what then 144,000 have got to be
[21:08] protective until the two prophets bring
[21:11] every one of them out so for three and a
[21:14] half years they can't be killed the two
[21:19] prophets can't be kidding for three and
[21:22] a half year are for 1260 day yes par the
[21:25] 144,000 12,000 of the pure genetic line
[21:29] of those twelve sons okay I can't say
[21:34] pure genetic line cuz there is no
[21:36] Puritan any line there's hope your
[21:39] innate line there'd be no intermarrying
[21:41] between it I have a brother in bomas
[21:44] Jewish preparing my citizenship right so
[21:47] he can see how I don't know that God has
[21:51] to look at that but man you go all the
[21:52] way back to to Solomon and and what's
[21:57] her name now with almond and solvent not
[22:00] Solomon Solomon married Rahab Salman was
[22:06] an Israeli general he married a Gentile

[25:12] finish the transgression make a finish
[25:14] of it not push it back
[25:18] not moving out of the way to finish it
[25:20] all right excuse me now if we go back in
[25:23] the day again we'll find out Daniel we
[25:25] find out the 24th worse to finish
[25:26] transgression finish what to finish
[25:29] Israel transgression so this is talking
[25:31] just about Israel right what is a
[25:35] transgressed it is to go against
[25:36] something transgressed against me is to
[25:39] do a wrong to me transgress against you
[25:42] to do the wrong to you so Israel did it
[25:45] wrong to God and in this 70th week you
[25:51] should we said 70th week remember Israel
[25:58] sure their transgression was finished
[26:00] here but what a finish back here in his
[26:01] 69 week I hope everybody got that now
[26:07] sure this is the foundation building up
[26:08] to it there's no way me and you can be
[26:10] born again without the foundation of the
[26:11] word being already bad right right like
[26:15] Jewel said you made a really good point
[26:16] the seed is the word the word is where
[26:18] you go back to its the word that you
[26:20] held inside to use what was quickly all
[26:22] right yeah you didn't have it when you
[26:24] were born but the word were there in
[26:26] that form I can see that that was a
[26:28] sequel alright so that's what it is it
[26:31] still worth its being quicken right now
[26:33] it's the word is being quick you can't
[26:36] you can't understand God without
[26:38] hearings work right just as simple of
[26:42] that you can alright so well that God is
[26:48] going to finish the transgression of
[26:49] Israel in this 70th week so where's it
[26:52] got where's all the redemption going to
[26:53] happen after we're gone because remember
[26:58] they're not renamed while we're here
[27:00] they're not redeemed before we got here
[27:04] but God is building a platform why
[27:07] because what they're going to do it just
[27:09] not mean you if you're born again in
[27:12] this age right here you look all the way
[27:14] back to Calvary and see where he already
[27:18] forgive your sin right hey Calgary
[27:22] that's my brother Anson don't ever
[27:24] forget calorie Calvary it's the point
[27:26] that everybody goes back to so what is
[27:29] we're going to do
[27:29] once we get out of here in few profits
[27:31] come down what are they gonna preach
[27:32] calorie you missed it you missed it he
[27:37] came to you and you missed it right
[27:41] that's right then that's where we're
[27:43] reading maybe next Sunday of your next I
[27:45] want to get into about two or three of
[27:46] these and then we're going to turn back
[27:47] into Jeremiah and Ezekiel in some of
[27:49] those places where he said where did you
[27:51] get those scars because then I realized
[27:54] right there when it happened with the
[27:55] Calvary turning away or the gun violence
[27:57] from Jacob and then all Israel will be
[28:00] born again now look you said oh brother
[28:02] Gramps at all Israel be born again only
[28:06] 144,000 go back to the Bible you got to
[28:09] go back to the Bible the Bible will
[28:11] preach to Israel and they'll be 144,000
[28:14] safe all right not all of Israel and all
[28:18] of them will receive the Holy Spirit
[28:20] food 144,000 right so number one is
[28:23] finished a transgression where did they
[28:25] transgressed at Calvary they've been
[28:28] transmission back before but this is our
[28:30] main point right here we can stay a long
[28:32] time on that but I don't want to go to
[28:34] preaching on just want to talk to you
[28:36] instead you get into it in the sealed
[28:38] all right number to make an end of sin
[28:41] now let's read again vintage
[28:43] transgression to make an end of sin
[28:45] that's his second person purpose of
[28:48] coming now what company is he talking
[28:51] about
[28:59] smurfs coming that's where he did it all
[29:02] he needed all his first coming he's not
[29:04] coming back here physically Jesus right
[29:08] he came here to finish it that's his
[29:11] second purpose of coming now what then
[29:15] you can apply it over here because he's
[29:19] going to be coming to Israel right but
[29:22] what's this going to be remember it's
[29:24] not the reek illing of the Lamb the day
[29:29] of atonement is going to happen right
[29:31] here and they're going to look back and
[29:33] see that he had already died they
[29:36] already had killed the lamb lamb patent
[29:38] don't have to be killed again right do
[29:42] you just didn't have to get on cross to
[29:43] die for you again he died one time
[29:45] accepted what he did that's his second
[29:48] person of coming first is the finish
[29:51] Israel's transgression and make an end
[29:52] of sense where did Israel sin where did
[29:55] they do their vital sin where did they
[29:58] separate themselves from God turn to
[30:01] Matthew 24 here's what his roommate her
[30:04] fatal mistake here's where she'd done
[30:05] her last cent because remember cut off
[30:09] after that right Daniel 9 24 said mossad
[30:15] was cut off but not for himself who was
[30:18] he cut off for us in Israel all right
[30:20] here's where she done her last Sam and
[30:22] the reason she's in the condition today
[30:25] Matthew the 27 chapter of Matthew's
[30:27] Gospel 25th verse the governor answered
[30:32] and said unto them whether I the train
[30:34] will you that I'll release into you
[30:36] we'ii than I release them to you and
[30:38] they said Bareilles now remember that's
[30:41] Israel that's the Jews remember they
[30:44] bring Jesus to pilot pilot said he's
[30:48] yours right he said there's yours I
[30:51] can't make a judge you give Jeff
[30:55] caller said unto them what shall I do
[30:58] with Jesus which is called Christ listen
[31:01] to them and they said unto him let him
[31:03] be crucified so the Jews decided not to
[31:08] Romans the Romans just carried out the
[31:10] descendants remember that's their
[31:15] Messiah that David said would come
[31:17] remember this morning in the lesson he
[31:20] will be cut off not for himself not
[31:22] nothing he did so he's identifying that
[31:26] Jesus was cut off at the cross let him
[31:28] be crucified and the governor said Why
[31:31] What evil has he done he's trying to
[31:34] talk him out of it but they cried out
[31:37] the more sane let it be crucified then
[31:39] Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing
[31:41] but rather a two month was made and he
[31:44] took water and washed his hands before
[31:45] the multitude saying I am innocent of
[31:47] the blood of this person sing to it see
[31:50] to it listen here's their mistake here
[31:52] is their sin then answered the people
[31:55] which were what Jews and says his blood
[31:58] be on us and on our children his blood
[32:02] be on us and our children in other words
[32:06] the generations coming down all right
[32:08] there is where they done it he was
[32:11] making an end of sin for them how could
[32:14] he do anything that helps but forgive
[32:16] him knowing that he had to blame their
[32:17] eyes that we could come in like his own
[32:20] children calling for his blood and they
[32:22] were blinded and he know they were
[32:23] blinded that's the reason he cried for
[32:25] forgiveness for them forgive a father
[32:26] for they know not what we're doing they
[32:28] were blind for our safe they were made
[32:30] blind and they'll unbelief they did this
[32:33] but when they see him again a man
[32:36] putting in the sim what is sin I believe
[32:39] they did not believe that was on the
[32:41] side they could not see him to be
[32:44] massaged yet he does every Sunday
[32:45] Messiah was supposed to do but they
[32:47] couldn't see it they were blind so when
[32:50] you see people say I don't believe in
[32:51] divine healing I can't see it I can't
[32:53] see the baptism the Holy go don't be
[32:54] angry with their money they say I can't
[32:58] see this message of him coming I can't
[33:00] see this baptism in the Holy Spirit I
[33:01] can't see the surface eat
[33:02] can see the stuff they're blinded oh not
[33:04] just pray for them all right in their
[33:08] unbelief but when they see him when he
[33:10] comes again it will make an end of their
[33:12] unbelief what right all right coming
[33:14] again in the two prophets okay then he's
[33:18] talking about Genesis 45 all right talk
[33:26] about Joseph because remember what does
[33:28] Jonas do he's perfect time of let's just
[33:36] wait that for next Sunday because I want
[33:38] to bring that in because remember Joseph
[33:40] is a perfect type of Christ so whatever
[33:42] that model of what happens to Joseph is
[33:45] what's going to happen in the seventy
[33:47] weeks of Daniel everything he does
[33:50] happens in the 70 weeks today it's a
[33:53] tight you understand not not during the
[33:55] time of that don't get me wrong he's not
[33:57] going to come up but it's a type of
[34:00] Joseph is a type of Christ Benjamin's
[34:04] the top of the 144,000 so you got Jesus
[34:08] in the 144,000 but when does he deal
[34:11] with him over here he doesn't deal with
[34:13] him here okay he deals with him here so
[34:17] this is where brother brown brains
[34:19] Joseph in and see Joseph was so 435 same
[34:23] one jesus oh Jesus more they thought he
[34:25] was dead remember the cumin he had two
[34:27] people in the prison but will read that
[34:30] because remember Joseph is exactly when
[34:36] he comes and his brothers coming they he
[34:39] reveals himself to them they say oh
[34:42] we're dead we have we have done our
[34:45] brother wrong you know we have sold him
[34:48] he we thought you were dead same thing
[34:50] same thing when Jesus reveals himself to
[34:54] them they're gonna say old man we're
[34:57] done for and he says no it was done to
[35:00] preserve life that's what Joseph member
[35:02] jord the reason Joseph went to Egypt got
[35:05] shot him a vision they be seven years of
[35:07] plenty and seven years of
[35:09] so during that seven years of plenty he
[35:11] just stored all the he built these huge
[35:14] grain bins and stored enough grain now
[35:16] look how smart he was he stored enough
[35:19] grain in those seven years to last those
[35:22] seven years plus seven more years that's
[35:24] why Joseph is called is prosperity and
[35:27] same way with Jesus when Jesus comes
[35:29] back there's nothing but prosperity but
[35:32] they're going to realize that they
[35:33] killed him and he said no I you it was
[35:37] done for a purpose it was done number
[35:40] one to save her I Gentile bride and
[35:42] number two to save you okay so we'll get
[35:45] into that type next next Sunday but to
[35:47] finish the grant transgression to make
[35:49] an end of sin their sin was is what is
[35:52] the only once in unbelief they did not
[35:55] believe he was the Messiah but you know
[35:58] what he's going to be revealed and then
[36:01] I'm gonna realize that he's got to be
[36:04] crucified again they gonna realize he's
[36:06] already done the work and they just got
[36:10] accepted now to me that makes an insane
[36:12] that did it don't make you the end of
[36:13] your sin even in true justification if
[36:17] you're that's what I want to I want to
[36:19] warn all of you sitting in this room
[36:21] today struck me the other day I was
[36:25] thinking about something to happen and
[36:28] it's close to around here but we had
[36:31] this man that that he was he treated his
[36:35] family wrong and he was not a convicted
[36:39] child molester but he molested children
[36:42] but he gave his heart to gun
[36:47] he gave his heart to God was truly born
[36:50] again what are you gonna do that what
[36:54] are you gonna do God don't see it mom
[37:00] God don't see it from long we all been
[37:03] out in the world most of us but out in
[37:05] the world makes a lot of things we may
[37:07] have done with boys and girls or men and
[37:09] women or whenever I out in the world and
[37:10] one day on Judgment you're gonna be
[37:12] standing up there judging the whole
[37:14] world and that person is going to be
[37:15] standing there looking up at you knowing
[37:19] that you had a connection with that sim
[37:20] that was got sim that they did what's
[37:24] the difference if your sins truly
[37:27] forgiven you can't hold it against the
[37:30] people right now they certain things I
[37:32] wouldn't do if I you know a convicted
[37:34] child molester or somebody like that you
[37:36] understand two-minute i'm going to the
[37:37] extreme right come here child molester
[37:39] worse than any but but if god truly
[37:42] saved the soul changed him turned him
[37:46] into a god-fearing person and he was
[37:48] truly born again there's nothing you can
[37:50] say about you tell me why the jesus
[37:53] going to judge if Jesus going to judge
[37:55] them for all the hideous thing they did
[37:57] to him he's gonna say it was done to
[38:00] preserve you Jesus is not going to
[38:04] condemn them he's already saved on that
[38:08] much telling us all to be careful how
[38:10] they even we can't forget but we got to
[38:15] realize that if God forgave that person
[38:18] God didn't say it so you take God why
[38:20] did it y'all no way to do if he's truly
[38:24] born again that to me that's why the new
[38:26] birth programs it was most important
[38:28] thing you could have cuz once a new
[38:29] birth comes down it takes and takes
[38:31] everything away I'm telling you that's
[38:35] why this right here is very hard
[38:38] brotherly kindness is very very hard to
[38:42] have true brotherly time
[38:44] because that right there is loving that
[38:47] man that man molested your child
[38:48] whatever you aren't you on st. are you
[38:51] how are you absolutely hey listen God
[38:57] forgive them remember what growing
[38:59] around said program said if you've been
[39:01] forgiven of a sin he said I can't bring
[39:03] it on from another blood why cuz it
[39:05] ain't there he said I may know it as a
[39:08] human because under discernment he might
[39:10] be able to see things remember and God
[39:13] would tell me said don't touch that
[39:14] right why he can't bring it back out if
[39:17] it's been forgiven he said I can't see
[39:19] it he said I you know somebody may come
[39:20] and tell me that this guy's a thief but
[39:23] my brother branham would discern that
[39:25] man even see no debrie in that man if he
[39:28] was a true born again believer so
[39:29] whatever this person told him about this
[39:31] other person it don't matter when it
[39:35] comes to God you know because god don't
[39:36] say it the guy that was telling except
[39:44] solutely correct good point cuz they
[39:47] brought it out from under the black bear
[39:49] so we have to be careful about the whole
[39:51] ago you know the hold of sometimes is
[39:52] not something we think it is you notice
[39:54] it listen god don't say good people
[39:57] running that's right I don't say goodbye
[40:02] amen I know saying good people good
[40:04] people are self righteous God saved
[40:07] people that work centers and like I said
[40:11] you know even to be nothing that you've
[40:12] never done anything in your life and you
[40:14] as pure as you can be if you didn't
[40:15] believe in God you just as bad as the
[40:17] person doing other things so all right
[40:19] don't want to get into that but I one
[40:21] just kind of bring it out cuz you come
[40:23] up with things in life and you say with
[40:25] wine you better leave it alone if that
[40:28] person was born again and if that person
[40:30] really truly asks for repent you better
[40:33] leave it alone I don't know why I'm
[40:34] telling you this but I'm telling you I
[40:36] didn't charge you another time for that
[40:37] get out of here
[40:40] we'll be own number
