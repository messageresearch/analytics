[6:58] they're pushing legislation that we do
[7:00] not go into that whatever that is in
[7:01] november
[7:02] this is daylight savings time right
[7:04] coming up
[7:05] so whatever the other one is we won't
[7:07] have it anymore
[7:08] so i never did like it very much anyway
[7:12] keep the time the way it is hey
[7:15] all right so let's go to hebrews 9 11
[7:18] and we will
[7:20] just background for a few minutes i know
[7:21] you got your papers in your hand we're
[7:23] going to start
[7:24] on the dimensions now just before we get
[7:28] started um
[7:30] when you look at those charts that come
[7:32] from
[7:33] and we'll give you quotes to to back
[7:35] that up brother joe's give it to us
[7:36] brother dale preached on it several
[7:38] years ago
[7:39] and that's your seven dimensions on that
[7:43] on that
[7:44] chart there and thank god for a prophet
[7:46] because if you go online and try to find
[7:48] all them and verbatim like he
[7:51] talked about them you ain't gonna find
[7:52] them right they're gonna talk about
[7:54] different things but it's not gonna lay
[7:56] it out like brother i'm laid it out
[7:57] because the world doesn't know the fifth
[7:59] dimension
[7:59] the world doesn't know the fifth
[8:01] dimension is where the unbelievers go
[8:04] my lord in this day and time there is no
[8:06] fifth dimension
[8:08] everybody's going to heaven they said so
[8:10] but we're going to have to cover
[8:12] them a little bit now remember before
[8:14] time started
[8:16] before time started it was all in a
[8:19] state of eternity it was
[8:20] it was their youth was being renewed
[8:22] adam and eve was
[8:24] was eating off the tree of life and
[8:26] that's the way it should have been and
[8:27] they would have come to eternal life
[8:30] in their body sooner or later amen amen
[8:34] and god was able to walk through this
[8:36] dimension and not
[8:37] not worry about it so to me
[8:40] there was not any dimension until
[8:43] dimensions until
[8:47] sin happened then we're going to see
[8:50] where the prophet said time came into
[8:51] being
[8:53] after the fall all right so
[8:56] uh the first the time the light
[9:00] and the matter and then you got sea
[9:03] taste filled smelling here now
[9:04] adam and eve were putting seed taste
[9:06] filled smelling here before the fall
[9:09] to contact their earthly home because
[9:10] they could eat they could breathe they
[9:12] could talk they could see they could
[9:13] smell
[9:14] but they didn't they lived in
[9:17] perfect faith because they didn't really
[9:20] they didn't have to have faith
[9:23] like we have to have faith we have to
[9:25] have faith for healing right
[9:27] we have to have faith for the atonement
[9:29] right
[9:30] they didn't have to amen
[9:33] but now when the fall happened
[9:36] everything slowed down got put back into
[9:38] time
[9:39] god had to make these dimensions because
[9:40] all of a sudden you got abel
[9:42] being killed well abel got to go
[9:44] somewhere he can't stay here
[9:47] he can't go in the fourth dimension he
[9:49] can't go in the fifth dimension
[9:50] he can can't go in the seventh dimension
[9:52] so he's got to go somewhere
[9:54] to wait a time for all things to be
[9:57] brought back together and we'll look at
[9:59] that with our bigger chart that we got
[10:02] what where it says adam to the future
[10:04] home and they're laying around here
[10:05] somewhere so
[10:07] um i believe though that
[10:10] adam and eve lived in i believe it was
[10:13] the seventh dimension all of them were
[10:14] together
[10:16] that's just what i believe because they
[10:17] can move in and out anywhere they wanted
[10:18] to i believe they could see angels i
[10:20] believe they could see
[10:22] because there was no other dimension to
[10:23] me because god brother brown said god
[10:25] came down in the cool today and talked
[10:26] to adam and eve
[10:28] you know face to face all right now
[10:30] remember he also did
[10:32] that to moses but he didn't do it to
[10:34] moses like he did
[10:35] adam right that's right everybody got
[10:37] that
[10:38] because moses wasn't the son of god
[10:42] adam was he was looking at god was
[10:45] looking at his progeny now he was
[10:46] looking at moses as his prophet
[10:49] and abraham as his friend but not as a
[10:53] genesis 1 26 person because that had to
[10:55] be withheld
[10:57] until jesus christ came himself and
[11:00] brought that with him so
[11:01] just keep that in your mind but we're
[11:03] going to
[11:05] background just for a minute so let's go
[11:07] back to hebrews 9
[11:09] verse 11 and let's pray dear heavenly
[11:11] father thank you for this evening that
[11:12] you give us the middle of the week
[11:14] that we can be re-energized and
[11:16] recharged
[11:18] from all the daily grind that we go
[11:19] through lord
[11:22] we know you're there with us but
[11:23] sometimes it feels like the world's just
[11:25] closing in on us but father
[11:27] you said you would be there you said you
[11:30] wouldn't leave us or you wouldn't
[11:31] forsake us you'd not put on us any more
[11:33] than we can stand
[11:35] so father i pray that you would just
[11:36] open our eyes give us the eye
[11:38] salve so that we can see you lord see
[11:41] the time that we're living in
[11:42] and that we all are part of this great
[11:46] eternal plan that you thought in your
[11:48] mind before the foundation of the world
[11:50] and it has not changed since
[11:53] lord we just got to make sure that we're
[11:55] a part of it that we connect ourselves
[11:57] to the eternal plan
[11:59] father we pray lord that you'd be with
[12:00] each one that's sick brother homer
[12:02] lingard we call his name lord every
[12:04] night because he needs prayer
[12:06] lord we talked to brother claude
[12:07] yesterday he needs prayer also lord he's
[12:09] doing better
[12:10] but they're out there in 17 below zero
[12:12] weather and
[12:14] we know how that is lord it's just it's
[12:15] a horrible time for all those people we
[12:17] pray that you just protect each one
[12:20] give each one travel and mercies thank
[12:21] you for bringing our brothers back home
[12:23] lord
[12:24] safe and we pray now that you'd be with
[12:26] each one take care of us
[12:28] on the rest of the week coming up lord
[12:30] and as we come to take communion may we
[12:32] clean ourself
[12:32] up lord and sanctify ourselves for this
[12:35] journey we know we can't do it but we
[12:36] know the one that can lord you're the
[12:38] sanctifier because of the washing of the
[12:39] water of the word
[12:41] we can be sanctified father we ask lord
[12:43] that you bless our pastor keep him
[12:45] strong
[12:46] be with brother curran lord and bless
[12:48] him raise him up lord
[12:49] touch him lord as he's i'm sure watching
[12:51] in now lord i pray that you give him
[12:53] supernatural strength
[12:55] because our natural strength is not any
[12:56] good but lord when you break through it
[12:59] that sound barrier is the prophet said
[13:01] and come into this dimension lord
[13:03] there's a noise it's a noise of healing
[13:06] and the noise of your
[13:07] saints raising their hand and saying
[13:09] thank you lord for what you've given us
[13:11] father we pray that you'd be with us in
[13:13] the furthermore this service in jesus
[13:14] name we pray
[13:16] amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being
[13:20] coming high priest of good things to
[13:21] come by a greater and more perfect
[13:23] tabernacle not made with hands
[13:25] that is to say not of this building
[13:27] brother dale's been on hebrews 10
[13:29] 5 on that for a while neither by the
[13:31] blood of goats and cows
[13:33] but by his own blood he entered in once
[13:38] into the holy place having obtained
[13:40] eternal redemption
[13:43] for us you may be seated in the lord at
[13:44] his blessing to the reading of the word
[13:46] and we thank you again for
[13:50] for all prayers we praying for each
[13:51] other
[13:54] we are praying daily for each other get
[13:57] somebody on your heart call their name
[14:00] if you have to call it again god's not
[14:03] deaf but it's good repetition
[14:05] to be able to call someone call the
[14:07] brother and sister's name and
[14:09] and uh you may be the one that breaks
[14:11] through
[14:12] amen so let's go to quote number one and
[14:15] it's one we've been reading and we're
[14:16] going to keep reading it because this
[14:18] it's worthy of reading jobs the oldest
[14:21] book in the bible was supposed to be
[14:22] even be written before moses wrote
[14:24] genesis but the oldest book in the bible
[14:26] was speaking of redemption
[14:27] and yet redemption was far be way before
[14:30] that
[14:31] redemption is one of the oldest things
[14:32] in the bible did you know redemption was
[14:34] even before the plan of redemption
[14:36] was laid out before the world was ever
[14:38] formed so before the dimensions started
[14:40] before sin happened before there was an
[14:42] earth
[14:43] before there was time light and matter
[14:45] there was red
[14:46] eternal redemption there was something
[14:48] going on in the mind of god
[14:50] and he was only going to unfold it
[14:53] completely
[14:54] down here in the end time amen he let it
[14:56] out in little pieces all down during the
[14:58] church ages and all down in
[15:00] even in the old testament he was showing
[15:02] types and shadows and types and shadows
[15:04] but remember a type has to have a
[15:07] reality to it
[15:08] and a shadow has to have a reality to it
[15:11] there has to be
[15:12] a there has to be a book before they can
[15:14] be a shadow
[15:16] before you see that shadow there's got
[15:17] to be this real book so brother brown
[15:19] said that
[15:19] the old testament was types and shadows
[15:23] shadows meaning it had to have something
[15:25] real well god was the only one that at
[15:27] that time
[15:28] had eternal life in the old testament
[15:31] everybody understand that
[15:33] when when sin happened in the garden of
[15:36] eden
[15:37] adam could not produce another son of
[15:40] god or daughter of god
[15:42] the way god wanted them produced because
[15:45] the womb of their mind was messed up
[15:47] amen so god had to take that ability or
[15:50] take that book
[15:52] back from adam the title deed brother
[15:55] brown calls it what's the title deed is
[15:57] something written down it's something
[15:58] that's given to somebody
[16:00] amen so the title deed then was written
[16:02] though brother john before the
[16:04] foundation of the world this is yours
[16:07] before the foundation of the world but
[16:09] you don't know that yet
[16:10] all of it you didn't know it when you
[16:12] was out in the world of sin but you know
[16:14] what there was
[16:15] see there it was for you so god
[16:18] foreseeing
[16:20] god foreseeing always for knowledge
[16:23] and making a way of redemption now a way
[16:26] of redemption means there's we got lost
[16:29] and god had to make a way back because
[16:32] man
[16:33] can't wait make a way back we cannot
[16:34] redeem see boaz
[16:36] could redeem naomi and show a beautiful
[16:38] type but
[16:39] boaz couldn't redeem boaz boaz needed a
[16:43] redeemer
[16:45] that's why they all made sacrifices
[16:46] which covered or capoed
[16:48] their sin until christ the main
[16:50] sacrifice come
[16:52] being a high priest of good things to
[16:53] come by a greater more perfect
[16:55] tabernacle what his body
[16:57] and then inside that body of jesus
[16:58] christ was a soul a soul that not could
[17:00] just
[17:01] that could not just have to go into a
[17:03] dimension and stay there
[17:05] see that was adam's problem adam when
[17:07] adam died he went into the dimension he
[17:09] couldn't help nobody
[17:11] but god when he died as jesus christ
[17:14] when
[17:15] the body died he stepped over in another
[17:17] dimension
[17:18] went to preach to the souls in prison
[17:20] picked up the people in paradise took
[17:22] him to heaven
[17:23] come back down on the day of pentecost
[17:25] he's the only one that can do that
[17:27] he's the only commun one that can move
[17:29] between those dimensions he's the only
[17:31] one that can do that
[17:32] and he's moving through them to get to
[17:34] you
[17:36] so to me though the looking at these
[17:38] dimensions
[17:40] it's really interesting as we get a
[17:41] little bit closer
[17:43] to that sixth dimension which is where
[17:46] the believers go
[17:49] when they pass away so we'll get to that
[17:52] though maybe
[17:53] before easter we'll try to get to it
[17:57] but look for the bible plain that says
[17:59] that christ was predestinated for
[18:00] ordained
[18:01] and was the lamb of god slain before the
[18:04] foundation of the world
[18:05] according to what revelations 13 8
[18:09] kind of kind of something when it's
[18:10] revelations 13 8
[18:13] in hebrews 13 8. yeah okay
[18:16] slain before the foundational world
[18:17] that's right way before the world was
[18:19] made god had a plan
[18:21] of redemption now remember that plan
[18:24] could not change when god thought it it
[18:27] was perfect
[18:28] can't change you can't change nothing
[18:30] it's like brother dale said and i've
[18:32] always said
[18:33] you say well i can't understand this
[18:35] listen this is the only way you can
[18:37] understand god or he would have
[18:38] wrote it different right amen he'd have
[18:41] sent a different prophet
[18:42] right he'd have sent a different brother
[18:43] dale he'd have sent you another pastor
[18:46] he sent you everything you need you know
[18:48] what the problem is
[18:50] [Applause]
[18:52] i can't i just don't i don't understand
[18:56] if you got the holy ghost you got to
[18:59] understand
[19:00] that's right so if you're not
[19:02] understanding pray for the holy ghost
[19:06] don't pray for an emotion pray for the
[19:08] holy ghost
[19:11] pray for the holy ghost and he's going
[19:12] to have to lead you and guide you into
[19:14] all truth because you promised
[19:15] then you can take him when you get the
[19:17] baptism from the holy ghost you take him
[19:18] to the word
[19:19] you say god i don't understand this but
[19:21] if you're inside me you've got to
[19:23] explain
[19:24] this you've got to put some preacher
[19:26] some
[19:27] brother some sister in my way
[19:31] problem is that sometimes we get in the
[19:33] way
[19:34] when god wants to put somebody in the
[19:36] way we'll get in the way
[19:38] but i hope that's what you're seeing
[19:40] it's not just times and all these charts
[19:42] and things that we're doing
[19:43] this is redemption this is just a simple
[19:46] plan
[19:47] that was before the foundation of the
[19:48] world it's just that you and i have a
[19:51] way to navigate through it now
[19:53] and not have any like brother brown said
[19:55] not to make a new doctrine
[19:57] but to straighten out old doctrine that
[19:59] you are
[20:02] sealed if you have the baptism of the
[20:04] holy ghost you cannot be lost
[20:07] if if is a big old word
[20:12] if you have eternal life tonight that
[20:15] eternal life always
[20:17] was eternal we'll get to that titus 1
[20:19] verse 1
[20:20] says paul the servant of god an apostle
[20:22] of jesus christ according to the faith
[20:23] of god's elect
[20:25] and the acknowledging of the truth which
[20:27] is after godliness and hope of eternal
[20:28] life which god
[20:30] that cannot lie promised before the
[20:33] world began
[20:34] but hath in due times manifested his
[20:37] word through preaching
[20:39] which is committed unto me according to
[20:40] the commandment of god our savior
[20:42] we need preaching we
[20:46] need a five-fold ministry
[20:49] one man cannot fulfill that five-fold
[20:52] ministry
[20:53] now reason i said that now brother brown
[20:56] did fulfill the five-fold ministry when
[20:57] he was alive and preaching
[20:59] remember the angel said do the work of
[21:00] an evangelist he did the work as a
[21:02] pastor
[21:02] he did the work as as uh obviously he
[21:05] was a prophet
[21:07] but he wasn't that kind of prophet he
[21:08] was above that prophet he was an
[21:10] he was a seventh church age messenger
[21:12] prophet he was a prophet to bring one
[21:14] specific message
[21:16] now if we got prophets in the five-fold
[21:17] ministry now they don't bring one
[21:19] specific message
[21:20] they're for the people to help the
[21:23] people to discern
[21:25] and i believe we got them we just got to
[21:28] let them work but this was promised
[21:31] before the world began through preaching
[21:33] this is the way it's going to have to
[21:35] listen
[21:36] you can press play all you want to but
[21:37] it's going to take a prophet
[21:40] pastor teacher evangelist apostle it's
[21:43] going to take all
[21:44] those to perfect you you might listen to
[21:46] the prophet of god all your days of your
[21:48] life and die and go to hell
[21:54] didn't caiphus stand up and say we have
[21:57] moses's message in other words if it was
[21:59] a
[21:59] tape recorder of moses preaching
[22:02] caiaphas would have said we got moses
[22:03] preaching we be abraham's children
[22:07] you know what jesus looked at him and
[22:08] said the word looked at him
[22:11] the word looked at that and said you're
[22:14] dead
[22:14] right you got a different daddy
[22:18] than i do wow
[22:21] that's those two spirits
[22:25] and they'll hate you oh my goodness
[22:27] brother claude and i were talking about
[22:28] it last night you know the two spirits
[22:29] one's gonna
[22:30] one's gonna hate the other one not just
[22:32] not just like them one's gonna hate the
[22:33] other one
[22:35] so let's go to ephesians one this to me
[22:37] sums up the whole thing
[22:39] paul an apostle jesus christ by the will
[22:41] of god to the saints which are ephesus
[22:44] and lula and to the faithful in christ
[22:46] jesus grace be to you and peace from god
[22:48] our father and from the lord jesus
[22:49] christ
[22:50] blessed be the god and father sounds
[22:51] like he's trinitarian doesn't he bless
[22:53] be the god and father of our lord jesus
[22:54] christ who has blessed us with all
[22:55] spiritual blessing
[22:56] he can speak that the world can think
[22:58] that but in his mind never was a trinity
[23:01] right right but that's the way god hid
[23:03] it
[23:05] from the wise and prudent and revealed
[23:07] it to babes such as would learn like you
[23:09] and i
[23:10] according as he has chosen us in him
[23:13] before the foundational world that we
[23:15] should be holy without blame before him
[23:16] in love
[23:17] already before the foundation of the
[23:19] world having predestinated by what
[23:22] foreign knowledge having predestinated
[23:25] us into the adoption of children
[23:27] see he can predestinate down the line
[23:29] because he knows that line you're going
[23:30] down
[23:32] and not make you go down that line
[23:33] remember the prophet of god said god
[23:35] didn't put you through a little hole and
[23:36] pull you through a tube
[23:38] no it's your choice wouldn't moses stand
[23:42] up one day and he said choose you this
[23:43] day who you'll serve
[23:45] he was telling the people of god that
[23:47] right
[23:48] choose you this day who you'll serve
[23:51] all right so they had to make a choice
[23:52] so do me and you having predestinated us
[23:56] into the adoption of children
[23:58] by jesus christ to himself according to
[24:00] the good pleasure of his will
[24:02] what is his will his will is his word
[24:04] all right
[24:05] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[24:07] when he hath made us accepted in the
[24:09] beloved
[24:10] the only way we're accepted is through
[24:11] him we're not accepted in any other
[24:13] thing we're not accepted
[24:14] in our own works and our goodness and
[24:16] our own well you know i've been in the
[24:18] message 50 years
[24:19] so what in whom we have redemption
[24:22] through his blood
[24:24] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[24:26] riches of his grace
[24:27] wherein he hath abounded i like that
[24:30] word heaped
[24:31] heaped it upon us toward us in all
[24:33] wisdom and prudence
[24:35] having made known unto us the mystery of
[24:37] his will now here
[24:38] he's going to tell you he's going to
[24:39] make known to you the mystery of the
[24:41] will of god amen
[24:42] all right according to his good pleasure
[24:44] which has purposed in himself
[24:46] because remember we're working right now
[24:48] under permissive will i haven't really
[24:50] got on to that but
[24:51] we are this is permitted right
[24:54] this is permitted power that satan has
[24:57] this is a permitted life that god's
[24:59] given you because your mom and daddy
[25:00] brought it here
[25:01] totally different than god wanted you to
[25:03] come
[25:04] but he by a new birth he has brought you
[25:08] to himself
[25:10] amen chosen you in him before the
[25:12] foundation of the world
[25:14] having made known unto us what us that
[25:16] mystery
[25:17] of where we come from what we're doing
[25:19] here and where we're going
[25:21] according his good pleasure which he has
[25:22] purposed in himself what was he perfect
[25:25] why did he purpose it in himself because
[25:26] he can't
[25:27] listen he has entrusted sure he has
[25:29] entrusted me and you to take this to the
[25:31] end time
[25:32] but he didn't trust nobody when he stood
[25:33] and he said i'll do it
[25:36] remember the bible said the bible said
[25:39] when he couldn't swear by no other
[25:42] he swore by himself that he was going to
[25:45] do this
[25:46] plan of redemption and you know what if
[25:48] he's eternal and perfect and cannot
[25:53] right can i make a mistake but all we
[25:56] got to do
[25:56] brother luis is connect ourselves to
[25:58] that
[26:00] according to his good pleasure which is
[26:02] purpose in himself that in the
[26:03] dispensation of the fullness of time
[26:04] like right now
[26:06] he might gather together in one in other
[26:09] words type those loose ends
[26:13] that's what he's saying he might gather
[26:15] together what
[26:16] well if obviously if he had to gather it
[26:18] together it got pulled apart somewhere
[26:22] he's gathering it together all things in
[26:25] what
[26:25] in in in christ
[26:29] both which are in heaven and which are
[26:32] on earth even in him
[26:33] and whom also we have obtained an
[26:35] inheritance
[26:37] we weren't just come down here with a
[26:39] silver spoon in our mouth people
[26:41] i don't care what nobody says the bible
[26:44] says he's born in sin and shaping the
[26:45] iniquity
[26:46] spouse from your mother's womb a liar
[26:48] doomed and on your way to hell put about
[26:50] four scriptures together okay
[26:54] there's none good no not
[26:57] one jesus even looked at that brother
[27:00] that was talking to him and he said
[27:02] i'm not worthy i'm not good now what and
[27:04] it's in his humanity and it's in
[27:06] humanity
[27:07] sure jesus made mistakes as a human he
[27:09] didn't make mistakes when he spoke the
[27:11] word of god though because he was the
[27:12] word of god
[27:13] amen in him also we have obtained an
[27:15] inheritance
[27:16] being predestinated according to the
[27:18] purpose of him
[27:20] who foresaw who worketh all things after
[27:24] the council
[27:25] of his own will in other words he wrote
[27:27] the bible he saw what was going to
[27:29] happen he wrote the bible and then he
[27:30] sent it down to us so it can't
[27:32] it can't go wrong
[27:35] there's no way it can go wrong
[27:39] and i'm again like brother dale quit
[27:41] questioning
[27:42] why god did it this way it's the only
[27:45] way we're going to be able to understand
[27:47] how would you think
[27:48] jesus stood one day and he said why me a
[27:51] father
[27:52] if my child asks for bread give him a
[27:56] rock
[27:58] or ask for this and i give him a serpent
[28:01] so why would god send his word to
[28:03] confuse his children
[28:05] he's not going to send his word to
[28:06] confuse you that's right
[28:08] maybe you're not a child if you're
[28:10] confused
[28:13] we just got to hit let the rubber hit
[28:15] the road okay
[28:19] i feel a lot more more like brother dale
[28:20] i used to look cross-eyed at him every
[28:22] once in a while when he said i wish i
[28:23] could make you
[28:24] realize you were lost right because you
[28:26] know what if you realize your loss you
[28:28] can do something about it if you think
[28:30] you're saved
[28:31] nobody can help you except god amen
[28:35] in whom also we have obtained an
[28:36] inheritance being predestinated
[28:38] according to the purpose of him who
[28:39] worketh all things
[28:41] after the council of his own will let's
[28:43] read christ the mystery i kind of
[28:44] condensed these just a little bit so we
[28:46] could uh
[28:48] we could kind of hurry through this
[28:53] christmas mystery god now back in the
[28:55] back part of god's mind so that's where
[28:58] that's where the prophet of god went he
[28:59] went into the back part of god's mind
[29:01] how did he do that he did it by the
[29:03] opening of the seals the seals opened
[29:06] and he could see further than he'd ever
[29:10] seen remember he was a prophet he was
[29:11] the eagle
[29:12] he was the he was the one that came up
[29:14] the highest
[29:15] and he could see all four directions but
[29:17] you know what he done he didn't say
[29:19] okay you can't have this
[29:23] no even in the vision brother branham
[29:25] remember the vision where brother brown
[29:27] leaves somebody was covering it the
[29:30] other day
[29:31] he said look on this look
[29:35] stay right here and look on this in
[29:36] other words look on these 1100 tapes
[29:39] if i go away i'm going to go away but
[29:41] you look on this right here
[29:44] and you know what did they do they did
[29:46] just like the children of israel did
[29:48] they said yes brother and we'll do that
[29:50] no problem we'll do that and then when
[29:51] he died they scattered like the wind
[29:53] and never understood they never stayed
[29:55] there and looked but you know what you
[29:57] and i
[29:59] you and i were purposed to do that
[30:03] stand here and look on this what the
[30:05] full opening of the book
[30:07] in the back part of god's mind there was
[30:08] something that he was trying
[30:10] and was going to achieve and he had a
[30:12] motive in doing it
[30:14] in order to let himself be expressed in
[30:15] other words be a father to be a son to
[30:17] be a healer
[30:18] to be a savior to be a redeemer to be
[30:21] all those great attributes
[30:23] just like you and i as men and women we
[30:25] we long to have children or we long to
[30:27] have this or that or the other
[30:29] well that longing is inside of you right
[30:31] because you're you're born in the image
[30:33] of god i don't care adolf hitler was
[30:34] born in the image of god he was a human
[30:36] being
[30:38] but by choice he decided not to do that
[30:40] he decided to yield himself to that
[30:42] other spirit
[30:43] and you see what happened so now let's
[30:45] go to genesis 1 26 and we
[30:47] richard said are you not going to put
[30:48] the scripture up there i said i think i
[30:50] can quote it without putting it up there
[30:54] so god created a man in his own image in
[30:55] the image of god created him male and
[30:57] female
[30:57] created he them that's all you need to
[30:59] know so god created a being
[31:02] he brought something to the forefront
[31:04] and remember we were talking about that
[31:06] was every born-again believer
[31:11] did everybody understand that genesis 1
[31:14] 26
[31:14] is not every human being it's not moses
[31:17] it's not elijah
[31:19] it's not the great prophets in the old
[31:21] testament not even john the baptist
[31:26] you say oh no he got the holy ghost he
[31:28] might have got the holy ghost but he
[31:29] didn't get the new birth
[31:32] he might have got an anointing because
[31:33] he was a prophet
[31:36] you know why because jesus looked at him
[31:38] he said the least in the kingdom
[31:39] what is the kingdom there's your kingdom
[31:43] that the kingdom is the baptism of the
[31:46] holy ghost
[31:47] in your soul the new birth not just an
[31:51] anointing
[31:52] right amen and he looked at that
[31:55] person he said the least in the kingdom
[31:58] is greater than john the baptist
[32:00] john preached the kingdom john saw the
[32:02] kingdom standing there
[32:04] but it was not his time the the testator
[32:08] had to die you looked in john 5 i
[32:12] believe it is it says the holy ghost had
[32:13] not been given because jesus had not
[32:14] been glorified in other words jesus had
[32:16] not been put on the cross
[32:17] to release that life he couldn't release
[32:20] that life
[32:20] under blood of bulls and goats it was
[32:22] only that life of the blood of the bulls
[32:24] and goats
[32:26] i hope you understand that because it
[32:28] really will help you in in redemption
[32:30] now
[32:31] now when jesus died on the cross he put
[32:33] both hands this way new testament old
[32:35] testament
[32:36] he pulled those old testament saints in
[32:38] but they're not
[32:39] going to be in that city as bride
[32:44] bride is only those that are lost
[32:48] and then god by the baptism of the holy
[32:50] ghost takes that kookaburra
[32:52] nature out of you and puts that weak
[32:55] nature in only god can do that
[32:58] he didn't do that for moses he didn't do
[33:00] that for aaron he didn't do that for
[33:02] all the ones in the old testament they
[33:05] all had flaws
[33:07] i think today how in the world could he
[33:08] take somebody like rahab the harlot and
[33:10] bring something through it
[33:11] but he did because he's the only one who
[33:14] can clean it up
[33:15] right but there's your tops and shadows
[33:18] don't let us
[33:19] don't let us try to go marry a
[33:20] prostitute hello
[33:23] we know better we've been born again
[33:26] david would not have had his best friend
[33:28] killed if he'd have been born again
[33:29] because that nature of the old david was
[33:31] still in there
[33:32] and if the nature of god was in there
[33:34] david wouldn't do that
[33:36] same way me and you we don't do the
[33:38] things we used to do i hope
[33:40] amen so by foreign knowledge god knew
[33:44] all these things and four knowledge is
[33:45] what
[33:46] and we know that all things work
[33:47] together for good to them that love god
[33:50] to them who
[33:50] are the called according to his purpose
[33:55] many are called but few are chosen
[33:57] though a lot of people are called
[33:59] but he's talking about right here these
[34:01] are called according to his purpose
[34:04] for whom he did for no
[34:08] back part of god's mind those he
[34:11] foreknew
[34:12] he did see or predestinate
[34:16] to be conformed to the image of his son
[34:20] why because he saw what we would do and
[34:23] wrote this thing right here for us
[34:26] you'll never get born again you'll never
[34:28] be a child of god
[34:29] till you see yourself in the word if you
[34:32] can't see yourself in the word tonight
[34:33] you can't be a child of god something
[34:35] has got to resonate
[34:37] in this bible but that's me
[34:42] that's for me and i don't even if it's a
[34:45] type or a shadow
[34:47] we were all rahab right we had many
[34:50] husbands we were a woman at the well
[34:56] but he knew we would want this as
[34:59] brother brown said that man said said
[35:01] god
[35:02] if you don't give me the holy ghost
[35:03] you're going to find a pile of bones
[35:05] sitting out here and wherever it was the
[35:07] wood pile have you been that serious yet
[35:14] if not then maybe you need to start
[35:20] because like i said before the days
[35:24] there's two things you should not do in
[35:26] this church
[35:27] number one is misunderstand because
[35:30] we've been over it
[35:30] june and i were talking coming up the
[35:32] road
[35:34] and mama was saying last night at home
[35:38] she said it's i've heard this for 50
[35:40] years
[35:42] and brother dale hadn't changed and
[35:44] brother claude always tells me he said
[35:47] it is scientifically proven that you
[35:49] have to listen to something
[35:51] 14 times before you can get it into your
[35:54] brain
[35:56] 14 times so i'm on sermon number six
[36:02] brother dale's been on sometimes 90
[36:04] sermons and he reviews and reviews and
[36:07] you know why reviews
[36:08] it's like jim said well maybe she didn't
[36:11] get it this time but somebody else did
[36:16] but a good pastor doesn't leave anybody
[36:17] behind
[36:19] he knows what you need and god knows
[36:20] what you need amen
[36:22] so don't worry about if we're see i'm
[36:24] backgrounding this for six sermons
[36:26] i'm backgrounding this same identical
[36:27] thing right here but are we getting
[36:29] something a little bit extra every time
[36:30] that's
[36:31] i'm even getting something a little bit
[36:32] extra every time
[36:35] so like i said before if the plan of
[36:37] redemption doesn't isn't more clear now
[36:39] than it ever has been in your life
[36:42] you need to ask god to get you up that
[36:44] statue of a perfect man
[36:45] to where it says knowledge
[36:50] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[36:53] all the different ones
[36:54] as brother claude now we're talking
[36:56] about he's preaching on the uh
[36:59] the kinds of love which is eros and then
[37:01] the love for your
[37:02] for your husband and wife and then you
[37:05] are for your
[37:06] brother and your sister and your mom and
[37:07] your daddy and then the love for your
[37:09] wife
[37:10] and then none of those even touch that
[37:12] love that's what that love is agape love
[37:14] that agape love is way past and it's not
[37:17] that good sloppy stuff that we like you
[37:19] know huggy kissy sweetie
[37:20] uh no brother brown always said love is
[37:24] corrective
[37:25] hey man for knowledge
[37:30] everybody got foreknowledge you should
[37:33] but like i said before we're going to go
[37:34] over it again number three
[37:36] we're going to let brother brown explain
[37:37] it right here he explains stuff a lot
[37:39] better than we do
[37:40] the word predestinate that's not a good
[37:42] word to use the word for knowledge is
[37:44] better
[37:45] predestination looks back to foreign
[37:46] knowledge and foreign knowledge looks to
[37:48] destination but god not making
[37:50] set in order a little hole that you have
[37:52] to go through
[37:53] and you can't go no other way
[37:57] that's not the way he did it but
[38:00] god in order to be god he knowed the end
[38:03] from the beginning
[38:05] how about a god that even the prophet
[38:07] said he knew how many fleas
[38:09] that god would make that ever be on this
[38:11] earth and how many times it
[38:12] bat it's little bitty eye you can't even
[38:14] see a flea
[38:16] and he's got an eyeball and he's got
[38:19] tala that stuff that matter that gets
[38:21] inside of you he knows him how much that
[38:23] would
[38:25] how can we understand him but brother
[38:26] louise he he give us a way to understand
[38:28] what we need
[38:30] he gave us a way to understand i don't
[38:32] have to understand how many times the
[38:34] nat bats die but i know the guy that
[38:35] does
[38:37] hey man i know the guy that does know
[38:41] google ain't got nothing on god
[38:46] way before google ever even got started
[38:48] god was already doing it himself
[38:51] he's got all the information we need all
[38:53] we got to do is pull it up in his bible
[38:55] pull it up in the prophet's message
[38:57] number four questions and answers this
[38:59] is the one we were talking about
[39:03] and listen we're not trying to be
[39:07] different but we are different
[39:10] i know some of the ministers that are
[39:12] here
[39:14] i'm just going to say it they probably
[39:15] had a little a little problem when they
[39:18] first got here about
[39:19] because all you hear everywhere you go
[39:21] is you always was eternal you had this
[39:23] eternal seed in you all you needed to do
[39:24] was
[39:24] realize the message was right all you
[39:26] had to do is realize you know hear the
[39:28] mother eagle crying you're all
[39:29] you know that not even going through
[39:32] justification sanctification baptism
[39:33] holy ghost and and you hear that so much
[39:35] prevalent in the message and then you
[39:36] come here and we're
[39:37] you're you know we're not trying to
[39:38] disprove that i believe that but you got
[39:40] to put it in his right condition
[39:43] you got to put it in his right way if
[39:46] you are born again tonight you that i'm
[39:49] looking at
[39:49] not was not always eternal right that
[39:52] thing inside of you that you accepted
[39:55] on the day you got born again that is
[39:58] eternal
[39:59] and it's working its way out through the
[40:02] plan of redemption
[40:06] don't ever the prophet of god said i'll
[40:07] bring the quote maybe next sunday he
[40:09] said never forget
[40:10] that word right redemption
[40:15] how can i take a cuckoo burn america
[40:16] grain oh brother wait i always was wheat
[40:20] well well i'm gonna read you a quote and
[40:22] you'd argue with brother brown
[40:24] okay we've read this before i got like
[40:26] seven quotes
[40:27] on this i just picked a few how can i
[40:29] take a cuckober and make a grain of
[40:30] wheat out of it
[40:31] it's impossible for me to do it i can't
[40:34] save myself
[40:35] you can't save yourself you can't save
[40:37] your children
[40:39] but i know somebody can i know somebody
[40:42] can
[40:44] and look it's impossible for me and you
[40:47] but what did the angel say to mary he
[40:49] said with god
[40:50] all things are possible
[40:54] so i know somebody that's got a possible
[40:56] not an impossible
[40:58] you know if you ever take something to
[40:59] god says impossible he's like
[41:01] you asking the wrong guy ask the devil
[41:06] he thinks that stuff's impossible he
[41:07] said ain't nothing impossible to god
[41:10] the only way it can be is because inside
[41:13] that kuckerberg has been
[41:14] transmitted there's something going to
[41:16] happen
[41:18] something's got to break a dimension
[41:20] something's got to come down into this
[41:22] dimension and break this thing up that
[41:24] you and i are living under this time
[41:25] life and matter
[41:26] because this life that we're living down
[41:28] here is going to go away
[41:32] but eternal life has to come from
[41:33] somewhere and come inside of you
[41:36] then the bible says we're what sitting
[41:38] together in heavenly places it takes us
[41:40] right back up to that seventh dimension
[41:42] where god is we just can't see him with
[41:45] our natural eyes and we'll talk
[41:46] about that a little bit the only way it
[41:48] can be be is because inside the cuckoo
[41:50] bird
[41:51] has been transmitted from a kokober
[41:54] wheat a cockabur to a germ
[41:56] called wheat germ now that cocker burr
[41:59] always wasn't a wheat
[42:02] it wasn't the cuckoo bear not always was
[42:03] a wheat
[42:05] right plant to cook a bird without
[42:08] anything you plant a cocoa berry it
[42:09] brings up cuckoo birch
[42:11] but brother branham is talking about by
[42:12] the power
[42:15] he preached the sermon the power of
[42:17] transformation
[42:20] that transforms you from a cockapur to a
[42:23] germ called wheat life
[42:24] then you bury that kookaburra it'll
[42:26] produce what
[42:27] a grain of wheat because there has been
[42:30] a life of wheat
[42:31] put in the kuckleberg and the life of
[42:34] the kuckelberg has been taken out
[42:37] but the nature of the cocker bird is
[42:38] still sticky now brother brown i'm
[42:39] talking about that
[42:40] second realm the spirit realm memory
[42:42] reason conscious affection imagination
[42:44] everybody got that right but the nature
[42:46] of the culture
[42:47] is still sticky and it will be until
[42:48] this new life has been fully
[42:50] been let me let me quote that right and
[42:53] it will be until this new life has
[42:55] fully been developed out of the ground
[42:58] and raised up again
[42:59] when it comes forth then it's no more
[43:01] cuckolder but wheat
[43:03] but wheat but while it's here on earth
[43:05] and out of the earth and a cuckleberry
[43:07] it's still sticky
[43:09] but it's got the nature on the inside of
[43:11] it of wheat
[43:12] as long as you're in this life you're
[43:14] going to be sticking have a carnal
[43:15] nature now we know that
[43:17] but remember that thing that's inside of
[43:19] you that in that soul is not sticky
[43:22] that's god that's the genesis 1 26
[43:25] that's the seed
[43:26] of god that's the theophany
[43:30] of god
[43:35] if i just said that most churches they'd
[43:37] be shouting y'all are sleeping
[43:40] if this don't excite you ain't nothing
[43:43] we can't
[43:44] like brother now we're talking about he
[43:45] watched the preacher online he said that
[43:46] preacher
[43:47] we got them people all worked up and
[43:49] emotional and
[43:51] they weren't even listening to what he
[43:52] was saying i'd rather you sit there and
[43:54] listen and not say nothing
[43:56] but now not with your eyes closed cause
[43:59] you're not listening then
[44:01] okay but look it's going to bother you
[44:05] as long as you live we know that
[44:07] but the inside of you you're born again
[44:11] and when you're raised up you're in the
[44:13] likeness of christ and all the sin has
[44:15] gone from you
[44:16] that's the thing brother brown said
[44:19] that's the thing
[44:20] let's go to the next one now number five
[44:23] and the seed shelf was essie gates of
[44:25] the enemy 1961
[44:26] but that's what we are like we are now a
[44:29] wheat a grain of wheat and god's garner
[44:32] when we was a cocker bear
[44:36] and i'm going to say this one more time
[44:39] i know i'm a cuckoo bird
[44:42] i know where it's at i was cuckober
[44:46] through and through when i was out in
[44:47] the world
[44:48] i was born a coca bear even though come
[44:52] through godly parents it had to come
[44:53] through permissive will for me to get
[44:55] here
[44:56] and then god gives me a soul when god
[44:58] gives me a soul that soul is perfect and
[45:00] until until
[45:01] the day god starts recording my
[45:04] choices the age of accountability my
[45:08] soul is perfect
[45:09] and i will go to heaven if i die during
[45:11] that time all babies go to heaven
[45:13] brother brown said right
[45:14] because they're not judged they can't be
[45:16] judged by that but when you come up kids
[45:18] when you know right from wrong
[45:21] when you know to turn your head when you
[45:24] know not to walk in where you used to go
[45:25] like i said before you could go take a
[45:27] bath with a five-year-old two
[45:29] five-year-old man
[45:29] a boy and a girl and now you can't do
[45:32] that why because your mind starts
[45:33] thinking
[45:34] when your mind starts thinking your body
[45:36] starts reacting
[45:37] i don't know why i'm getting on this but
[45:38] i'm going to say it anyway be careful
[45:41] because you're cuckober through and
[45:43] through and listen
[45:45] when you put two cuckoo birds together
[45:52] take that any way you want to
[45:55] that's why the prophet of god and i'm
[45:56] telling you if you get the baptism of
[45:58] holy ghost though you're wheat
[46:00] you have the nature of the wheat inside
[46:02] of you
[46:03] and you have a you have a a
[46:06] more of a moral rudder you don't have i
[46:08] mean you should have a moral rudder not
[46:10] to cheat still lie and run around and
[46:11] all these things
[46:12] but you still got that bad nature but
[46:15] when you get that thing inside of you
[46:17] that's born again it will steer you in
[46:20] the right direction
[46:21] amen now most of you that's live life
[46:24] like i've lived
[46:26] you'll say amen
[46:30] but what does god do he takes that
[46:32] kunkelberg nature listen
[46:33] he doesn't kill you the person he likes
[46:35] who you are
[46:36] that's right or he wouldn't have made
[46:38] you that's the exactly
[46:40] but he knows that you'll want that new
[46:42] birth and you he'll know
[46:43] that that thing will you'll yield to it
[46:45] one day
[46:47] and he'll come in and what will it do
[46:48] not kill your old soul but
[46:50] burn that old nature off of it that
[46:52] cluckleberry
[46:54] will get burnt out and a germ of the
[46:57] life of god will be put in
[47:00] that's so simple not that it always was
[47:02] there
[47:03] it always was in god's mind it always
[47:06] was in the bible they didn't have to
[47:07] write a different bible when i got born
[47:09] again i got born again out of the same
[47:11] bible
[47:12] amen i got born to get out of the same
[47:14] bible that luther got born to get out of
[47:16] that wesley got born again columbia
[47:18] martin irenaeus
[47:20] same bible
[47:24] same word of god
[47:29] and god changed this from a cuckoo bird
[47:30] to a grain of wheat
[47:32] it makes the fruits different changing
[47:35] your own mind
[47:36] your own ideas it's the greatest miracle
[47:41] that ever happened you talk about
[47:44] miracles of
[47:45] of raising the dead what about raising
[47:48] somebody to newness of life
[47:50] what about raising somebody to a eternal
[47:53] life that satan can't ever take your
[47:54] regular life anymore
[47:56] oh yeah this one may drop off but where
[47:58] are you going to go you're going to step
[47:59] in that sixth dimension you'll step
[48:00] right back up pick that body up you're
[48:02] going to come back in
[48:02] a young kid and satan's not going to
[48:05] have nothing to do with that
[48:07] it's the greatest miracle that ever
[48:09] happened when a man or woman is born
[48:11] again of the spirit of god
[48:13] and becomes a what new
[48:17] what's new new creation
[48:21] something different
[48:24] your thinking changed
[48:28] i love that come on people goodness
[48:30] gracious
[48:31] this plan of redemption excites me
[48:33] because it's not just
[48:35] i always was this great something but
[48:36] you know what i was thinking yesterday
[48:38] though though now though if you stand in
[48:40] a place
[48:41] to where you look and you see that you
[48:43] are born again and you know that god's
[48:45] working through your life and you know
[48:46] you have a purpose on the earth
[48:48] i can now look back and sit and say
[48:49] thank you papa god that you i was in
[48:51] your mind
[48:52] i was there before the foundation of the
[48:55] world
[48:55] i was in your thinking you thought of me
[48:57] way before i thought of you
[49:00] and now i'm down here and you know what
[49:02] all he wants to do
[49:03] manifest what was up there
[49:07] real simple and then we have to look at
[49:11] representation because that's where it
[49:12] comes from because remember
[49:13] the little woman at the well had
[49:15] representation
[49:17] way down in her what in what she had the
[49:20] words she had we
[49:21] know that when messiah comes and see she
[49:24] was
[49:25] looking for this to be made flesh
[49:28] she wasn't just wandering around with a
[49:30] pot on her shoulder
[49:31] and going to husband number six and just
[49:34] no
[49:35] something down inside of her actually
[49:37] really was there
[49:42] that sounded off when the word met what
[49:45] she had read
[49:47] and she was looking for the hat
[49:51] but remember he came looking for her
[49:56] he said i must needs go by samaria
[49:59] right brother brown even tells you he
[50:01] said well the apostles probably thought
[50:03] he was going to go by just go buy some
[50:05] groceries or something why don't we need
[50:06] to go buy some area because it ain't you
[50:08] know ain't him on the way
[50:10] he said i must need to go buy some air
[50:11] why he knew by foreknowledge before the
[50:14] foundation of the world
[50:19] he knew where she'd be standing
[50:22] he knew she'd want what he had he knew
[50:26] now i'm not going to do that no more but
[50:28] she had representation
[50:30] he saw what she would do that's right he
[50:33] saw your response
[50:35] you had more than five husbands yourself
[50:39] he was married to everything in the
[50:40] world
[50:43] now if you want then i apologize
[50:46] but most of us were
[50:52] but see what i mean this eternal plan of
[50:56] redemption cannot change
[50:57] but when we attach ourselves to it it
[51:00] ought to make us shout just like job
[51:02] said
[51:02] where were you job
[51:06] what was god doing he by foreign
[51:07] knowledge in his mind it wasn't
[51:09] us his people but it was the attribute
[51:12] of somebody
[51:13] loving what he did loving and knowing
[51:16] that his children were going to come
[51:18] we're going to read it in psalms
[51:19] there's no way we couldn't come except
[51:21] by the way psalms says in continuous
[51:23] was our fashion as yet there was none of
[51:26] us
[51:30] listen god knew the children of israel
[51:34] would all die except for joshua and
[51:37] caleb and all them little people that
[51:39] grew up under
[51:40] joshua and caleb he knew the rest of
[51:41] them people was going to die
[51:44] yet he fed them every day he clothed
[51:46] them every day he'd give him a light by
[51:48] day and
[51:48] i mean a light by night and a pillow of
[51:50] cloud by day he took care of them
[51:52] he kept telling them when you get in the
[51:54] promised land this is what you're going
[51:55] to do they send 10 times
[51:57] about time seven or eight i would have
[51:58] just said forget it
[52:01] but he kept saying bro john he said when
[52:03] you get in the promised land do this
[52:06] when you get in the promised land do
[52:08] that when you get in the promised land
[52:10] he wasn't even what see god wasn't
[52:11] worried about because
[52:12] by foreign knowledge he saw he knew that
[52:14] somebody would make it to the promised
[52:17] is land all right but this woman had
[52:20] nothing to present
[52:21] she was filthy and dirty
[52:26] but she had heard the word and god knew
[52:30] that she would respond because brother
[52:31] brown said when the word
[52:32] met the word what the word down inside
[52:35] of her same way with me and you
[52:36] then she was looking for this to be made
[52:38] flesh so she had representation
[52:41] i took the other quote out but she had
[52:42] representation from predestination
[52:45] all right to me that's very simple and
[52:48] remember she didn't receive eternal life
[52:49] right then
[52:50] because there was nothing to give folks
[52:52] i won't be i hope you see that
[52:56] that only on the day of pentecost did
[52:58] god come back and release his
[53:00] life so that genesis 1 26 man
[53:03] couldn't be bottled up anymore in a man
[53:05] called jesus christ
[53:10] when that life was released when he come
[53:12] out of that
[53:13] tomb and said all power and heaven earth
[53:15] has been given unto me brother brown
[53:17] said he could have just took it right on
[53:18] back
[53:19] and not give it to nobody but he'd come
[53:21] back on the tail of pentecost and give
[53:23] it all back to the bride
[53:24] amen and that wasn't my job
[53:28] that was his it's my job to believe it
[53:32] like we're going to see in just a few
[53:34] minutes we're going to see that in these
[53:35] dimensions
[53:37] we have sea taste filled smelling here
[53:38] and brother brown says every one of
[53:40] those
[53:41] every one of them can be deceived and
[53:43] tricked
[53:45] but one cannot the sixth sense of faith
[53:49] cannot be tricked and it cannot be
[53:52] taken away from either so look here's
[53:54] this melchizedek number seven
[53:56] really quick here but i like these
[53:59] quotes because it really solidifies
[54:01] here it is 1965 brother brown has not
[54:03] changed his way of
[54:04] preaching he's just preached a future
[54:07] home on the future home he said
[54:09] thank god i've preached these three
[54:11] steps of grace from a child
[54:13] justification sanctification baptism
[54:14] holy ghost now we see
[54:16] the attributes sons of his spirit have
[54:18] not yet entered into the word formed
[54:19] body now listen
[54:21] you've got to be careful we have a word
[54:23] for body inside of us that's what's
[54:25] developing and it's forming inside
[54:27] he's talking about the people he's
[54:29] looking at
[54:31] because that body come from mom and
[54:33] daddy a germ a sperm and an egg got
[54:35] together put it in a warm place and you
[54:36] came
[54:37] but god still had to give you the soul
[54:42] so you have not yet entered into the
[54:44] word form body but a theophany
[54:46] this body is subject to the word and
[54:49] earnest waiting for the earnest change
[54:51] of the body we're all subject to the
[54:52] word if you're born again
[54:54] you're subject to the word of god but
[54:55] you know what you're also subject to the
[54:57] word if you're not born again
[55:00] because you get the condemnation part if
[55:03] you're not subject to the word of god
[55:04] inside of you tonight you're going
[55:06] to judgment and you're going to have to
[55:07] stand in front of the word
[55:09] and you're going to have to give an
[55:10] account of what you did
[55:13] not what god did
[55:16] now the difference between him and you
[55:18] as a son he was at the beginning the
[55:21] word
[55:21] he could stand and say before abraham
[55:24] was
[55:24] i am john said in the beginning was the
[55:27] word words with god
[55:28] and the word was made flesh all right
[55:30] everybody got that
[55:32] so he was worried before he was human
[55:34] flesh
[55:37] we all don't do i know that because
[55:39] brother brown talks us he talks on
[55:41] genesis 1 26
[55:42] he said that was a word body a theophany
[55:45] so he could speak
[55:47] and even the even they tell him in the
[55:48] in the new old
[55:50] well matthew martin luther and john's
[55:51] still in the old testament okay
[55:53] but in the new testament in your book
[55:56] jesus says
[55:57] somebody says well you're the creator
[55:59] god
[56:01] we know that inside of you is the guy
[56:03] that created all things
[56:06] now the difference between him and you
[56:08] as a son he was at the beginning of the
[56:10] word in a morphing
[56:11] body because remember we didn't come
[56:13] here the word
[56:14] he came here exactly the way the word
[56:17] said but remember you and i came exactly
[56:19] the words that the way the word said to
[56:20] we just came wrong
[56:24] and had to be by transforming power
[56:26] listen
[56:27] jesus didn't need a new birth why did he
[56:31] not say he
[56:31] should have walked up next demons he
[56:33] said now nicodemus me and you
[56:35] need to be born again no he looked at
[56:37] nicodemus and he said
[56:39] you need a new birth
[56:45] and i hope that's what he's saying by
[56:46] the word tonight you need a new birth
[56:51] and if there's anything inside of you if
[56:52] you've heard the word and it's quickened
[56:54] in your life
[56:55] the word meets the word and then you
[56:58] become as the woman at the well
[57:00] there you have the potential of going to
[57:04] the upper room
[57:05] and receiving the holy ghost your own
[57:07] upper room
[57:09] amen we all have to have an upper room
[57:12] experience it don't matter where you at
[57:15] right you have to have an upper room
[57:17] experience
[57:19] you didn't see the lick of fire maybe
[57:20] but if you could see in another
[57:22] dimension you could see it
[57:23] cause that thing was coming down through
[57:25] the dimension into this dimension
[57:27] and there was licks of fire oh i want to
[57:29] get on that i've been looking at sound
[57:31] barrier
[57:32] brother brown talks about them birds out
[57:34] there in arizona
[57:36] breaking the sound barrier and what
[57:39] comes with a sound barrier
[57:41] a cloud thunder
[57:45] and a cloud always comes with breaking
[57:48] the sound barrier
[57:49] and the sound barrier is moving faster
[57:53] than the speed of sound we'll get into
[57:55] that just give you a little tidbit maybe
[57:57] you'll
[57:57] stay awake another 15 minutes then later
[58:01] we never heard
[58:02] no more melchizedek because what he in
[58:05] morphed
[58:06] he immorphed from melchizedek which was
[58:09] we know that was jesus christ
[58:11] theophany jesus christ not flesh jesus
[58:15] christ
[58:16] all he done was just slow down into this
[58:18] dimension
[58:19] as brother aaron always says he just
[58:22] picked up some dust
[58:24] and just went and it just formed all
[58:26] around his body
[58:29] did it for the other two angels and they
[58:32] come walking down into this dimension
[58:34] later we never heard no more melchizedek
[58:36] because it became jesus christ
[58:38] what brother member said melchizedek
[58:39] just disappeared
[58:42] went into this dimension stepped right
[58:44] out left the dust there and just
[58:46] stepped right back into another
[58:47] dimension until one day you heard
[58:50] [Music]
[58:52] a baby was born
[58:55] now theophany was made flesh
[59:00] then later we never heard no more
[59:01] melchizedek because it became jesus
[59:03] christ melchizedek
[59:04] was the priest but he became jesus
[59:06] christ
[59:07] what the high priest
[59:11] melchizedek could not be touched by the
[59:13] feeling of your infirmity
[59:14] he never looked at abraham and said i
[59:16] know how you feel
[59:18] no he looked at abraham and he said
[59:19] you're going to have a baby
[59:22] and you're going to have it through
[59:22] sarah and you're going to have it in a
[59:25] time of life
[59:26] i'll visit you
[59:31] he was telling him prophesying of what
[59:33] was to come now you bypassed that what
[59:35] you didn't come here with eternal life
[59:37] in you yellow
[59:40] he did because he was the chosen one he
[59:43] was god himself but he came in human
[59:46] flesh
[59:49] you and i just came in human flesh right
[59:52] and got a soul that was perfect
[59:58] you bypassed that what you come around
[1:00:00] it because in that form he knowed all
[1:00:03] things and you've never been able to
[1:00:05] know that yet
[1:00:06] right oh what about a time though when
[1:00:10] we get over there
[1:00:12] what about time even in the millennium
[1:00:13] what about time even during the future
[1:00:15] home
[1:00:15] i mean not even the future home the the
[1:00:17] wedding supper
[1:00:18] brother john we're limitless
[1:00:23] we're not limited by anything this has
[1:00:25] been made eternal
[1:00:27] this has been made eternal we've already
[1:00:29] got eternal life
[1:00:31] man it just explodes
[1:00:35] and you'll know all things but you'll
[1:00:37] not remember the bad
[1:00:38] because the bible says the former things
[1:00:40] will be passed away
[1:00:42] behold all things have become new
[1:00:45] you came like adam like me
[1:00:48] you come from attribute to the flesh to
[1:00:51] be
[1:00:52] tempted but when this life is finished
[1:00:54] here if it's at the time and i can be
[1:00:55] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:00:56] that's where we go that is the word that
[1:01:00] we can look back and see
[1:01:01] what we've done then we can look back
[1:01:03] that's what we're doing now
[1:01:05] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:01:08] become in other words we haven't become
[1:01:09] all the word you understand everything
[1:01:10] the word says
[1:01:11] no you don't as human as humanity
[1:01:15] because you're right here now some of
[1:01:16] you are asleep you can't understand
[1:01:18] what's going on for your sleep
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:23] then you can look back and see what
[1:01:24] we've done
[1:01:26] and we don't understand it we never
[1:01:28] become the word
[1:01:30] we just become the flesh man not the
[1:01:32] word
[1:01:33] but look but and look clearly makes it
[1:01:36] clear
[1:01:37] you will never be the word though unless
[1:01:39] you was a thought at the beginning
[1:01:41] very simple that proves the
[1:01:44] predestination
[1:01:45] for knowledge of god see you can't be
[1:01:48] the word unless you're a thought you had
[1:01:50] to be in the thinking
[1:01:52] first but you see in order to stand
[1:01:56] temptation
[1:01:58] you had to realize you were lost you had
[1:02:01] to realize you came the wrong way
[1:02:03] you had to realize that you were doomed
[1:02:06] and on your way to hell
[1:02:09] you had to bypass the theophany you had
[1:02:12] to come down here in flesh to be tempted
[1:02:13] by sin
[1:02:14] and then if you stand all the father's
[1:02:16] giving me will come to me and i'll raise
[1:02:17] him up to the last day
[1:02:18] see you had to be first in other words
[1:02:20] you had to come here first and realize
[1:02:21] who you were
[1:02:22] you had to realize you were lost
[1:02:26] listen you didn't realize you always was
[1:02:30] eternal i hope
[1:02:31] when you first started growing up and
[1:02:33] you started doing the things that all
[1:02:35] people do
[1:02:35] you didn't just up one day and say i'm
[1:02:37] eternal
[1:02:39] but yeah but yet listen but let yet
[1:02:41] listen though
[1:02:43] god did god did
[1:02:46] and he was just waiting on a time when
[1:02:48] you would strike that image
[1:02:51] that he saw before knowledge and he's
[1:02:54] then the word didn't meet the word
[1:02:56] and you become the theophany of god
[1:02:59] not of your parents because your parents
[1:03:03] didn't give you a soul anyway
[1:03:05] god gave you soul satan didn't give you
[1:03:07] a soul
[1:03:08] that's why the two soul people are wrong
[1:03:10] a soul listen the soul is so precious
[1:03:13] it's worth how much how much brother
[1:03:17] ten thousand worlds one soul
[1:03:22] is worth ten thousand of these earths
[1:03:28] and if you're eternal you're worth way
[1:03:30] more than that
[1:03:33] and then you see he come right down the
[1:03:34] regular line from after you before the
[1:03:36] foundation of the world his name is put
[1:03:37] on the lamb's book of life
[1:03:38] then from that he becomes the word the
[1:03:39] theophany that could appear and
[1:03:41] disappear
[1:03:42] then he became flesh and returned back
[1:03:43] you know he's talking about jesus christ
[1:03:44] and his name was written on the lamb's
[1:03:45] book of life he's
[1:03:46] he was there it was him resurrected that
[1:03:49] same body in the glorifying condition
[1:03:50] but you bypass the theophany
[1:03:53] what the genesis 1 26 man
[1:03:56] that's what you bypass you did not come
[1:03:59] here as an eternal child of god
[1:04:02] you come around that to be a child of
[1:04:04] samuel and peggy dale
[1:04:06] but with a ability
[1:04:13] you know if you bypass something
[1:04:16] and go around it but remember it's still
[1:04:19] there
[1:04:21] the city is still there you got to go
[1:04:24] back and get in the city
[1:04:26] but god help me god help you to realize
[1:04:29] that we became flesh man first to be
[1:04:31] tempted by sin and then if this earthly
[1:04:33] tabernacle is dissolved now brother
[1:04:34] brown is quoting scripture
[1:04:36] we have one already waiting we have not
[1:04:38] yet the bodies
[1:04:40] but look when this body receives the
[1:04:42] spirit of god
[1:04:43] the immortal life inside of you it
[1:04:46] throws this
[1:04:47] body in subjection to god
[1:04:50] this body in subjection to god
[1:04:54] everybody all right amen all right god's
[1:04:55] power to transform keep going that's
[1:04:57] good
[1:04:57] sons and daughters was in god at the
[1:04:59] beginning amen
[1:05:01] that genesis 1 26 man now look you've
[1:05:04] got eternal life you say
[1:05:07] we believe that that we got eternal life
[1:05:09] well there is only one form of
[1:05:11] eternal life and that's god and that's
[1:05:13] the only thing that eternally is god
[1:05:16] then if you've got eternal life
[1:05:22] you're a possessor that's right if you
[1:05:24] have eternal life that life that's
[1:05:26] in you always was
[1:05:30] and you were in the loins of god before
[1:05:32] there was even a world
[1:05:34] and when the word itself jesus himself
[1:05:36] is called the word saint john 1 and
[1:05:38] beginning with the word words that god
[1:05:39] in the word was god
[1:05:40] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:05:41] among us and you were in the loins of
[1:05:44] jesus went to calvary with him
[1:05:49] you died with him that's why the bible
[1:05:52] says if you're chosen in him that's what
[1:05:54] you've already went through
[1:05:56] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:05:58] the world chosen in him
[1:06:00] then you were in the lords of jesus you
[1:06:02] went to calvary with him you died with
[1:06:03] him you raised with him and today
[1:06:05] we're sitting in heavenly places in him
[1:06:08] filled with his spirit son and daughters
[1:06:10] of god
[1:06:11] died with him raised with him sure
[1:06:14] amen psalms 139 verse 15 says my
[1:06:17] substance was not hid from thee
[1:06:19] who's who's who's he talking to
[1:06:22] who's he talking to he's talking to god
[1:06:28] david talking to god under the
[1:06:30] inspiration
[1:06:32] my substance was not hid from thee when
[1:06:35] i was made in secret
[1:06:37] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[1:06:38] parts of the earth
[1:06:41] when your mom and daddy got together
[1:06:45] you were foreign because god knew you'd
[1:06:48] be here
[1:06:50] in the lowest parts of the earth all of
[1:06:52] us came from that part we didn't come
[1:06:54] from the high part we come from the low
[1:06:55] part
[1:06:56] thine eyes did see my substance
[1:07:00] yet being unperfect
[1:07:04] he knew we were going to come here on
[1:07:05] perfect
[1:07:08] and in thy book all my members were
[1:07:12] written
[1:07:14] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:07:16] as yet there was none of them
[1:07:19] revelations 13 8
[1:07:22] written in the lamb's book of life slain
[1:07:25] from the foundation of the world your
[1:07:28] name was already written in the book
[1:07:31] and we were put here to show the devil
[1:07:35] that our names was already written in
[1:07:37] the book amen
[1:07:39] pretty simple all right so everybody got
[1:07:42] that so we're not
[1:07:43] we're not i'm listen i'm not negating
[1:07:45] that you don't have eternal life you
[1:07:47] have
[1:07:48] if you have if you have eternal life
[1:07:50] tonight that always was eternal amen
[1:07:53] i i agree 100 but i believe you had to
[1:07:56] go through a plan of redemption
[1:07:59] a plan of grace a three-step process
[1:08:02] that everyone has to go through i don't
[1:08:05] care if it's
[1:08:06] luther wesley william marion branham
[1:08:12] listen he couldn't have taught it if he
[1:08:15] didn't go through it
[1:08:18] he couldn't have thought it you and i is
[1:08:20] what i said before if you can't take
[1:08:22] your
[1:08:24] um life through those three steps
[1:08:28] you don't have the new birth i'm just
[1:08:30] going to be playing you're just not born
[1:08:32] again
[1:08:33] if you can't know you know where you
[1:08:35] were justified
[1:08:36] you know where you were sanctified and
[1:08:39] you knew when god filled you with the
[1:08:40] holy ghost now
[1:08:41] here's the whole the whole difference in
[1:08:43] the way we preach it is what everybody
[1:08:45] else preaches that doesn't get that
[1:08:46] gives you all the ability to go up that
[1:08:48] statue of perfect man but you got to be
[1:08:50] sanctified every day
[1:08:51] you got to be justified
[1:08:55] you got to keep getting filled with the
[1:08:57] holy ghost
[1:08:59] you got to keep wanting more of god you
[1:09:01] got to keep wanting to be more like god
[1:09:05] but god saw who would and who wouldn't
[1:09:08] they told brother branham they said
[1:09:10] brother brown if you teach this like
[1:09:11] you're teaching why
[1:09:12] in the world are you even preaching
[1:09:14] what'd he say
[1:09:16] he said i don't know who's saved and
[1:09:17] who's not what he said brother louise he
[1:09:20] said i throw the net out
[1:09:22] every sunday and i draw the net in
[1:09:25] he said i get spiders and snakes and
[1:09:28] and all kinds of things he says but
[1:09:30] there's some fish in there somewhere
[1:09:33] i do catch a few fish he said so that's
[1:09:35] what we're doing we're fishing
[1:09:36] didn't god tell us to be fishers of men
[1:09:38] yes man
[1:09:39] we're not fishing for fish anymore we're
[1:09:41] fishing fishing for men
[1:09:43] all right so let's go and let's look at
[1:09:45] these dimensions
[1:09:48] and i want to prove to you in the bible
[1:09:52] that when you pass from this life just
[1:09:54] to make sure because
[1:09:56] i'll bring it maybe next sunday or maybe
[1:09:59] the sunday after where brother brown
[1:10:00] says
[1:10:01] he doesn't believe in transmigration
[1:10:04] or swapping or moving of souls and i'll
[1:10:07] read the quote and i don't either
[1:10:10] i don't believe my soul can go on
[1:10:11] brother boyd and i don't believe his can
[1:10:12] go into mine i don't believe my soul can
[1:10:14] go into an animal
[1:10:16] and i don't believe my soul can go into
[1:10:18] the fifth or sixth dimension and then
[1:10:19] come back into this one
[1:10:21] not until things happen is everybody
[1:10:24] okay with that
[1:10:25] so you know if you saw your grandma
[1:10:26] walking through the through your yard i
[1:10:29] don't know
[1:10:30] i don't know i said i don't know that's
[1:10:33] what i meant i don't know
[1:10:35] because you look at these paranormal
[1:10:37] things and all these different and then
[1:10:39] then you look where brother brown says
[1:10:41] he was in tucson the other day and
[1:10:43] remember the woman hit the man
[1:10:45] throwed him up in the air he comes back
[1:10:48] down and
[1:10:49] several people witnessed it the car hit
[1:10:51] it couldn't find a man
[1:10:53] to me that's um leave it alone
[1:10:57] look but abraham said son now remember
[1:10:59] abraham's dead by the time luke's been
[1:11:01] written right
[1:11:04] and the rich young ruler has already
[1:11:05] passed away also
[1:11:07] everybody got that but abraham said son
[1:11:10] remember that in thy lifetime
[1:11:14] receivethis died good things he's
[1:11:15] abraham is in this
[1:11:17] whatever dimension abraham's in he's
[1:11:18] stuck right there he can't go anywhere
[1:11:20] because he's but he's telling that guy
[1:11:21] that's in another one
[1:11:22] he's going don't you remember what
[1:11:23] happened back over here in your in thy
[1:11:26] lifetime
[1:11:27] receiveth thou good things and likewise
[1:11:29] lazarus evil things
[1:11:31] but now he is comforted and thou are
[1:11:33] tormented
[1:11:34] and besides all this between us and you
[1:11:37] there is a great
[1:11:38] gulf fixed fixed
[1:11:43] so that they which would pass from hence
[1:11:46] to you
[1:11:47] cannot right remember the rich young
[1:11:50] rulers looking at
[1:11:51] abraham or looking at lazarus in the
[1:11:53] bosom of abraham and saying hey can you
[1:11:55] come over here and help me
[1:11:58] right and abraham is telling them
[1:12:03] you can't go so that they which would
[1:12:05] pass from hence to you cannot
[1:12:08] neither can they pass to us that would
[1:12:10] come from thence
[1:12:12] in other words there's none of this
[1:12:13] going on you're stuck in whatever
[1:12:15] dimension you're in so these dimensions
[1:12:17] are real and the bible's proven that
[1:12:20] it's real
[1:12:21] because the rich young ruler is burning
[1:12:23] in hell
[1:12:24] in in torment and he's asking for some
[1:12:28] water
[1:12:29] from abra or from lazarus who is in the
[1:12:31] bosom of abraham everybody got that
[1:12:33] then what does the rich young ruler say
[1:12:36] it shows you that you don't lose your
[1:12:38] senses
[1:12:39] your senses go with you over there
[1:12:41] because he said oh
[1:12:43] go and tell my brothers
[1:12:47] not to come to this place
[1:12:51] what about that right there in the bible
[1:12:56] but it took a profit to separate all
[1:12:58] these dimensions out
[1:12:59] right amen now let's go to the next one
[1:13:02] down here
[1:13:04] the dimensions according to brother
[1:13:05] branham are
[1:13:07] light time and matter and we look at
[1:13:09] these you look at your chart and that's
[1:13:11] what you and i live in
[1:13:12] and we were given see tasteful smelling
[1:13:14] here to contact
[1:13:16] the first three dimensions everybody got
[1:13:18] that say amen
[1:13:20] all right so what happens now
[1:13:23] is this let me read
[1:13:26] i'm going to read this right here this
[1:13:28] quote where brother brown says look
[1:13:30] they don't have it they can leave it
[1:13:31] right there yeah i'm gonna read that one
[1:13:33] that's right
[1:13:35] good job now when we come along we
[1:13:37] remember that we live here in three
[1:13:38] dimensions
[1:13:39] and i don't know whether i can name them
[1:13:41] or not one of them is light
[1:13:43] the other is matter tommy you remember
[1:13:45] what the third is someone says something
[1:13:47] huh
[1:13:47] adam no someone says time time right now
[1:13:50] light time and matter or light matter in
[1:13:53] time
[1:13:54] and our five senses contact them
[1:13:56] dimensions
[1:13:57] our sight contacts light our feeling
[1:14:00] contacts matter
[1:14:01] and so forth everybody got that now
[1:14:04] now we know one thing's for sure
[1:14:07] before there was a fall because we know
[1:14:10] and i'll bring the quote next sunday
[1:14:11] brother brown says that there was no
[1:14:13] time
[1:14:15] now remember be careful with that there
[1:14:16] was no time but yet there was already
[1:14:18] light
[1:14:21] and there was already day and night
[1:14:25] remember he caused the moon to shine in
[1:14:27] the night and the sun to shine in the
[1:14:28] day
[1:14:29] but now remember that light right there
[1:14:31] is not the sun and the moon
[1:14:32] that's that light we were talking about
[1:14:34] that just
[1:14:35] blew everything up and just c and lit
[1:14:37] everything
[1:14:38] to me the light of god but what happened
[1:14:41] was though and i'll bring you another
[1:14:42] quote where brother branham says
[1:14:44] that when adam did what he did he said
[1:14:47] his soul became dim
[1:14:50] in other words there was a cloud put
[1:14:53] over him
[1:14:53] where he couldn't see back into that
[1:14:55] other dimension
[1:14:58] and i'll read another one right here it
[1:14:59] says dimensions in which we live in that
[1:15:01] are contacted by our five senses
[1:15:03] this is a slower dimension than the
[1:15:04] others that are not seen you know why
[1:15:06] they're slower
[1:15:07] because the fourth dimension you can't
[1:15:08] see you can see
[1:15:11] tasteful smelling here you can see light
[1:15:14] you can
[1:15:15] feel matter and we definitely know we in
[1:15:18] time
[1:15:20] everybody got that but now look
[1:15:24] when we get into that fourth dimension i
[1:15:25] want you to remember though that we are
[1:15:27] influenced by that fourth dimension
[1:15:31] now the fifth dimension in sixth
[1:15:32] dimension is where people go and they're
[1:15:33] held
[1:15:35] right so we're not influenced by that
[1:15:38] we're influenced by the fourth dimension
[1:15:40] and we'll really cover that fourth
[1:15:41] dimension but look what happens when
[1:15:43] when god talks to adam and he says adam
[1:15:46] where art thou
[1:15:48] and adam's like i'm hiding i don't know
[1:15:51] if i want to be around
[1:15:52] you or not right now well now what's
[1:15:54] happening is
[1:15:55] is god is doing what he's withdrawing
[1:15:57] himself
[1:15:59] he said i'll put enmity i won't talk to
[1:16:02] you like i used to talk to you
[1:16:04] but i'm not going to leave you adam i
[1:16:06] can't come down i can't this to
[1:16:08] their sin now you got to make i got to
[1:16:11] make this sacrifice
[1:16:13] to cover or capo your blood the the
[1:16:16] blood of the animal
[1:16:17] to cover your sin but watch this
[1:16:22] let me read this right here real quick
[1:16:28] look here friends let me give you this
[1:16:29] illustration i might have done it before
[1:16:31] what color is that shirt what color is
[1:16:33] my shirt blue
[1:16:34] all right have i got that but now listen
[1:16:37] what if you ask the blind man what color
[1:16:39] my shirt is
[1:16:41] anybody in here colorblind
[1:16:45] louise is a little bit colorblind and
[1:16:48] bless your heart but there are certain
[1:16:50] colors they can't see why
[1:16:52] why because something in your eyes
[1:16:57] not something in your soul you're not
[1:17:01] it's not something wrong with you you
[1:17:03] just got a deficiency
[1:17:04] well watch this i'll show you in just a
[1:17:06] minute
[1:17:08] i might have done it before what color
[1:17:09] is this shirt it's white anyone that's
[1:17:11] got sight knows this shirt's white
[1:17:13] you have five senses of the body see
[1:17:15] taste field smelling here
[1:17:16] now none of these senses will declare
[1:17:19] god
[1:17:20] now remember though brother brown said
[1:17:22] god put adam and flesh in five senses to
[1:17:24] contact the earth
[1:17:27] but see in my belief i can't find a
[1:17:29] quote and it's not in the bible
[1:17:31] but adam was ruled by the sixth sense
[1:17:35] of faith because he can move mountains
[1:17:38] he can move trees
[1:17:39] he could change the weather he could
[1:17:41] travel through any dimension he wanted
[1:17:43] to how do you think he ruled the whole
[1:17:44] world he didn't stand in one place
[1:17:47] he was all over the place but what
[1:17:50] happened was though is when he
[1:17:51] when sin was committed what did it do it
[1:17:54] limited him
[1:17:56] to where he's at in other words this
[1:17:58] became solid
[1:18:02] time became his killer
[1:18:05] because the bible says adam lived
[1:18:07] 950-something years
[1:18:09] and he died time
[1:18:12] was not before that though god never
[1:18:14] told them he was going to die until they
[1:18:16] did what they did
[1:18:17] amen and they still had the five senses
[1:18:19] like i said before
[1:18:20] you're not going to lose your five
[1:18:22] senses
[1:18:23] ever again when you go into the other
[1:18:26] dimension
[1:18:28] you're not going to lose your seat field
[1:18:30] smelling hair
[1:18:35] i just proved that to you abraham was
[1:18:38] looking looking at the rich young ruler
[1:18:43] and said and was talking to him and said
[1:18:45] we can't go over there and you can't
[1:18:46] come over here
[1:18:50] what happened to samuel the prophet he
[1:18:52] was called up by the witch of endor what
[1:18:54] happened he still had his robe on
[1:18:55] still was prophesying still was looking
[1:18:58] the way he looked because the witch of
[1:19:00] endor said
[1:19:01] i brought samuel up wait look just like
[1:19:03] he did
[1:19:04] but now remember here's your key that
[1:19:07] was under the old testament
[1:19:09] he looked like he did when he died right
[1:19:11] he wasn't a young man
[1:19:14] why because he wasn't born again right
[1:19:16] he didn't have that gender the only
[1:19:17] thing he's going to change your body
[1:19:18] backs that genesis 1 26 man
[1:19:21] now they will get changed you understand
[1:19:22] what i'm saying we're not leaving them
[1:19:24] out
[1:19:25] but he came up the same way he died
[1:19:27] because he was
[1:19:28] in what the bosom of abraham are in
[1:19:30] paradise
[1:19:31] and we'll cover that what brother brown
[1:19:32] says about that
[1:19:34] god made man he made him in his image
[1:19:36] instead of man's
[1:19:37] and he put him in five senses to contact
[1:19:39] his earthly home
[1:19:40] not to contact god with those senses
[1:19:44] don't declare god
[1:19:49] now god uses them but who else uses them
[1:19:51] too the devil uses them too
[1:19:54] they declare why because it's you steal
[1:19:57] a cocker bear
[1:19:59] out here they declare the earthly home
[1:20:02] where the man had to contact his earthly
[1:20:04] home
[1:20:05] he had to see taste fill smell in here
[1:20:07] but faith is the substance of things
[1:20:09] hoped for
[1:20:10] the evidence of what thing's not seen
[1:20:13] you do not see it taste it feel it smell
[1:20:16] it or hear it
[1:20:17] but you believe it see what i mean you
[1:20:19] see
[1:20:20] taste feel smell
[1:20:24] and hear now let's go the statue of
[1:20:26] perfect man because i want to
[1:20:27] cover this real quick
[1:20:32] and watch what happens now we all know
[1:20:35] this
[1:20:36] it's where the prophet of god created
[1:20:40] squirrels
[1:20:41] or he called the squirrels to come into
[1:20:42] existence but but there had to something
[1:20:45] no i'm sorry i'm sorry that's not right
[1:20:48] this instant
[1:20:49] he was writing the statue of a perfect
[1:20:50] man he was writing that down on a piece
[1:20:52] of paper that he had not written before
[1:20:54] sorry but watch what happened so for
[1:20:57] days before we have the service i
[1:20:58] constantly pray go to the woods take in
[1:21:00] my pocket tell the wife i'm going
[1:21:01] squirrel hunting this morning
[1:21:03] put a pencil on the paper in my pocket
[1:21:04] as soon as it gets light enough i'm
[1:21:06] sitting against the tree somewhere
[1:21:08] hands up in the air and said lord what
[1:21:10] can i do today what will you give me for
[1:21:12] your children
[1:21:13] now remember god we know god comes into
[1:21:17] this dimension and he
[1:21:18] and he um influences us
[1:21:22] but what about his presence
[1:21:25] because there stood brother branham in a
[1:21:27] prayer line he was standing with the
[1:21:28] baptism of the holy ghost i believe a
[1:21:31] adopted son of god and he still had to
[1:21:35] wait on that presence to come there
[1:21:38] because that was a different presence
[1:21:40] that was something else working this is
[1:21:41] a different watch with this
[1:21:43] but watch watch how it got there this is
[1:21:45] my whole point watch how it got there
[1:21:47] and we'll look at how the the first
[1:21:49] three dimensions are so much slower
[1:21:51] and then we'll talk about next uh we'll
[1:21:53] close right there and we'll talk about
[1:21:55] uh
[1:21:56] um the speed of sound next sunday
[1:22:00] then when i strike something that seems
[1:22:02] to burn down comes something like
[1:22:04] when his presence gets near
[1:22:07] i began to hear something like way off
[1:22:10] in the distance something in the order
[1:22:11] now if you've heard this tape
[1:22:13] sister cleda can probably tell you
[1:22:14] exactly what he says 2
[1:22:16] times 2 equals 4. then the next time he
[1:22:20] says
[1:22:20] closer 2 times 2 equal 4. then 2 times 2
[1:22:23] equal 4 2 times
[1:22:24] he gets faster with his 2 times 2 equals
[1:22:26] 4.
[1:22:27] brother brown speaks each repeats a
[1:22:29] little faster well they told you right
[1:22:31] there
[1:22:33] but i'm sure sister clay can do
[1:22:34] something on and on and on like that
[1:22:36] it's his
[1:22:37] presence coming in it wasn't there
[1:22:41] at the time it was coming in but what
[1:22:44] was it doing
[1:22:44] it was coming faster into this dimension
[1:22:51] because when you will look next sunday
[1:22:52] when brother brown talks about the birds
[1:22:55] and the little birds and the bigger
[1:22:56] birds and the angels he said they came
[1:22:58] from
[1:22:58] eternity so fast into this dimension
[1:23:04] yield yourself and after a while you
[1:23:06] break away from yourself
[1:23:07] there comes division go to such and such
[1:23:10] place now remember
[1:23:12] visions do not come from this dimension
[1:23:19] even television you can't get it in
[1:23:22] first three dimensions
[1:23:23] it has to be a fourth dimension thing it
[1:23:26] has to break into another dimension and
[1:23:28] you can see it so the prophet of god
[1:23:31] has to wait on that thing to come out of
[1:23:33] fast out of eternity
[1:23:36] slow down enough to where he gets there
[1:23:37] where he's at and then what
[1:23:40] there comes the vision go to such and
[1:23:41] such a place such and such a thing
[1:23:43] starts off from meditating your mind on
[1:23:45] god out of the world
[1:23:47] away from the world out in the
[1:23:48] wilderness to yourself and watch and it
[1:23:51] starts coming
[1:23:52] one one and he keeps doing it one number
[1:23:54] anything just something starts gradually
[1:23:56] faintly coming in
[1:23:57] then it comes faster and faster what
[1:24:00] it's coming from a faster dimension
[1:24:02] into this one so we're in the slowest
[1:24:06] dimension listen you're the slowest
[1:24:07] dimension you'll ever be in
[1:24:10] then it comes faster faster you sit
[1:24:12] there and raise up your hands don't say
[1:24:13] a word just hold your hands in the air
[1:24:15] first thing you know your whole being is
[1:24:17] caught away then you see
[1:24:19] things that he wants you to know showing
[1:24:21] you things
[1:24:23] that is to come how about that
[1:24:28] he's standing in life and time and
[1:24:30] matter
[1:24:33] and then here comes something a presence
[1:24:35] from another dimension
[1:24:37] into this dimension slows itself down
[1:24:40] enough
[1:24:41] so he can talk to a prophet but you know
[1:24:44] what though
[1:24:46] how many times have you heard musicians
[1:24:48] come we'll stop right there how many
[1:24:50] times have you heard though
[1:24:51] that that presence would come to him
[1:24:54] and he'd say i spent all day searching
[1:24:57] the scripture
[1:24:59] because you wanted to make sure that
[1:25:01] that presence wasn't coming from
[1:25:02] somebody else
[1:25:04] because the devil i promise you the
[1:25:05] devil has got a presence also
[1:25:08] he will present himself just like god
[1:25:13] but he can't be on the word right he
[1:25:16] can't be the word of god
[1:25:17] so the first three dimensions life time
[1:25:20] and matter will start on them sunday
[1:25:22] but that's where you and i live and
[1:25:24] we're given five senses to contact
[1:25:26] our earthly home see takes phil smelling
[1:25:28] here and they can all be tricked
[1:25:31] they can all be tricked except one and
[1:25:34] that's
[1:25:34] faith faith is the substance of things
[1:25:37] hoped for
[1:25:37] the evidence of things not seen you
[1:25:38] don't have to see do you have to see
[1:25:40] your healing to get it
[1:25:42] i thought you had to believe it to see
[1:25:45] it
[1:25:45] not see it to believe it because if you
[1:25:47] see it you don't have to believe it
[1:25:50] so faith is the substance of things
[1:25:52] hoped for the evidence of things
[1:25:54] not seen bringing it into this dimension
[1:25:59] listen when you get a revelation
[1:26:02] it's not from this dimension right
[1:26:05] because satan is prevalent in this
[1:26:07] dimension to give you his revelation but
[1:26:09] when god comes why did
[1:26:10] why did he have to why'd the prophet
[1:26:11] have to explain that god the presence
[1:26:13] had to come
[1:26:14] into his dimension right
[1:26:17] but now we're going to see in just a
[1:26:19] little while though
[1:26:21] next sunday where that he was taken
[1:26:24] into another dimension
[1:26:28] remember he went in the sixth dimension
[1:26:30] he was taken
[1:26:31] into another dimension that was much
[1:26:34] faster than this one but he looked back
[1:26:36] and saw his body
[1:26:37] because his body couldn't go with him it
[1:26:39] was that one inside of him is what went
[1:26:42] his theophany was what went his body
[1:26:44] stayed down there
[1:26:46] so we'll get into it a little bit next
[1:26:47] sunday but let's stand our feet god
[1:26:49] bless you
[1:26:50] love you with love of the lord
[1:26:54] there's just a lot that we cover talking
[1:26:57] about eternal redemption and i don't
[1:26:58] want to leave anybody out or
[1:27:00] leave anybody behind but they
[1:27:04] we need to understand these things so
[1:27:05] that there's not questions in our mind
[1:27:09] but we know one thing's for sure we live
[1:27:10] in this dimension
[1:27:12] lifetime and matter but we are reacted
[1:27:15] by other dimensions remember i already
[1:27:17] told you the fourth dimension is running
[1:27:18] right through here right now and there's
[1:27:20] every
[1:27:20] every website there's every there's
[1:27:23] there's pictures of you don't want to
[1:27:25] see there's conversations of men and
[1:27:28] women and men and men that you don't
[1:27:29] want to hear going right through this
[1:27:31] room right now and you can receive it
[1:27:34] but you got to have something to receive
[1:27:36] it with you got to have a phone you got
[1:27:37] to have a
[1:27:38] ipad you got to have a what you got to
[1:27:40] have a piece of equipment
[1:27:43] and i believe god's equipped me and you
[1:27:46] to hear from him
[1:27:47] let's sing a song
[1:27:51] let's sing a song then we'll be
[1:27:52] dismissed prison chain
[1:27:58] with bleeding stride
[1:28:04] paul inside
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:08] just think about your prayer your prayer
[1:28:10] has to go into another dimension
[1:28:12] your prayer has to break those sound
[1:28:14] barriers and go into another dimension
[1:28:17] so that god can hear your prayer to sing
[1:28:23] there change worlds
[1:28:26] think about him now and they were free
[1:28:33] i bless your name
[1:28:38] i bless your name
[1:28:42] every time god spoke
[1:28:45] there was thunder but there was a voice
[1:28:48] behind that thunder
[1:28:51] because it broke the sound barrier and
[1:28:53] came from
[1:28:54] this other dimension into the dimension
[1:28:57] that you and i were in
[1:28:58] are in now and i believe that's what
[1:29:01] happened when the seals broke
[1:29:03] this dimension was broke and there was
[1:29:06] thunders
[1:29:07] that sounded was the voice of god
[1:29:10] given a message not to william branham
[1:29:13] but through william branham to the bride
[1:29:23] you're in a prayer think about it
[1:29:28] son in your mind all them demons talking
[1:29:31] to you from another dimension
[1:29:33] reach out and pray
[1:29:36] defy what they say defy
[1:29:40] stand up against it they will fall
[1:29:47] in jesus name sing it to him
[1:29:51] oh i bless your name

[1:30:24] to him again
[1:30:25] i bless your name
[1:30:29] we bless you we bless your
[1:30:33] think about it we believe because the
[1:30:36] name of jesus christ
[1:30:39] will do away with everything you need
[1:30:49] you are the light
[1:30:54] the truth lord you know where this is
[1:30:56] going you know what lord our brother
[1:30:58] needs and we pray that you bless him now
[1:30:59] in jesus name lord
[1:31:01] amen i bless your
[1:31:05] name think about him now here we are
[1:31:08] we're standing in the ocean and we
[1:31:10] understand all these things now more
[1:31:12] than anybody ever
[1:31:13] but let's not make it just head
[1:31:15] knowledge let's let it go down here
[1:31:19] where we can stand in front of the devil
[1:31:21] and say uh
[1:31:24] take your hands off of that alpha that's
[1:31:26] my child
[1:31:28] that's my husband that's my wife that's
[1:31:30] my friend that's my family
[1:31:31] satan you don't have a right to that oh
[1:31:34] you just wait and let it thunder
[1:31:36] sometime
[1:31:37] your voice your voice will be heard
[1:31:42] over everything that goes on in heaven
[1:31:45] everything god will hear you
[1:31:49] before he'll hear anything else not an
[1:31:52] angel
[1:31:53] no one else he'll hear your prayer and
[1:31:55] your voice
[1:31:57] be sincere when you pray
[1:32:00] call the name that's what i've been
