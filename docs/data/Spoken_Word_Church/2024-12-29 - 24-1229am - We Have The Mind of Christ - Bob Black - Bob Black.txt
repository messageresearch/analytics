========================================

were commenting about how that they were never able to be delivered of alcohol until they found Jesus you know you never know what you don't know what state they're in you know whether they're Justified Sanctified whatever but that one thing you know they the only thing that worked for them was God and that's what happens when God comes in he changes you well I hope you had a a good uh time with your family and uh let me see here we did we had uh yesterday was a little bit depressing our little our little Chihuahua passed and we had to burier so it was a very sad day for us well I don't know what's going on here but we'll try to make do let's uh bow our heads Lord Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word today Lord and I pray Lord that today will be a special day that you'll bless us Lord with encouragement and and help us along the way Lord I pray God that you'll guide us through these scriptures Lord as we study these things out and help us today we pray in your name amen now we're we're going through the book of Corinthians um that that is a little bit small but uh I don't I apologize yall I don't know what's going on on here we uh well if you can't read it we'll just just listen um so we're going through the book of Corinthians and we and we landed on this this verse that says we have the mind of Christ which is there at the end of the uh of the first chapter and we'll back up a little bit and exam these scriptures a little bit more but when you when you really think about the mind of Christ it's it's uh you think about the um uh you know that the Son of God is is referred to as the word of God and every that God's got all these thoughts and he expresses these thoughts and he frames it up as the word so when you're hearing the word of God it it's actually it it's just like what brother R was talking about there it it's changing you it changes you so that you you the the world starts dropping away and and God deity is actually begin to to be expressed because you hear the word of God and brother Rand I'm going to explain as I read all these quotes that what happens as you begin to hear the word of God it begins to frame up your your uh not your head thinking but your heart thinking to where you start you start looking at things differently and uh you you think that that's that's really profound how that uh you know a Christian just can't hardly get along with you know a non-Christian or something because you think different and the word actually starts making you think about things instead of looking so much of the present you're thinking about the future and and looking at things to be against one another you're looking to be for something and it starts everything starts shaping shaping up your your world view and and and and I've got this picture of the Fig Tree and that's really that's really the culmination of change shaping your mind up so that you can believe that whatever God promised no matter what the circumstances are his promises are true and you're going to believe that regardless to be able to speak like Jesus did to the Fig Tree and speak to the mountain and speak because you believe that it is God's word is true and and you don't care if what the doctor's report is and you don't care like Abraham Abraham didn't care how many years had passed as his as his uh body began to get more and more frail it it didn't matter because the word of God mattered more because of the way he was thinking about it than the circumstances so that's really getting it to the mind of Christ so if we go back in 1 Corinthians to verses 11 to 16 and just kind of read that again to set a background for what what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God and he's he's talking about we're we're not we're not just it's not just head knowledge but we're connected to the Divine because we've heard the word of God and it's it's actually shaping us so that we now can think like God and we can now tap into his spirit so because he's giving us he's giving us his Supernatural knowledge because we've got his his life living in us which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth not not a lot of Education not in lectures but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is Judge of no is judged of no man that's speaking of your perspective if you've got the Holy Ghost you looking at things different somebody that doesn't have the Holy Ghost is looking at you and wondering what's going on with you he he that is spiritual judgeth all things he can discern right and wrong he can he's looking at things from a totally different perspective than the carnal man and the carnal man is looking at him and he can't he doesn't know how to judge the person that's filled with the Holy Ghost to him it's just a peculiar Oddball person for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ now brother Brandon would say and the word became flesh he said every word in the Bible is God's thoughts laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the thing to pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be now now that's where you know living below your privileges like because we we fail sometimes to grasp that the word of God is so true and so real that if we will believe it it will open up a CH channel to deity and and it will actually manifest in your life it will change your life it'll change your family it it will do something the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and that's where brother R would say is see your your thinking is your character because the way that you think about things will manifest in the way that you treat others and the way that you act and the way that you behave because the way that you're thinking in your heart that's what you are now your thoughts if they become expression like God said let there be a world before it could be a word it had to be a thought so God and the creation created the world by his thought first then spoke it and the thought expressed became material see what I mean now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light that said let there be trees and there was trees and if that same mind that was in Christ be in you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it will be gone let the blind eyes be open and it would be so see it's your thought Jesus said verily you said that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily I say unto you if you shall say to this mountain be moved plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will will come to pass you'll have whatever things thou sayest now that seems like a a phrase that stumbles us a little bit really anything that I say you mean I can have peace in my home you mean I I can uh those those things that that are those uh that depression or that anxiety or those those pills that I have to keep taking to to to help with whatever problem I've got that I can be delivered of that whatever you'll have whatever things thou sayest now then we start framing up in our mind well I got to prove I got to I got to work real hard I strain real hard but it doesn't come like that it's just the word like a sheep eating grass you just keep eating and eating and eating and the Sheep ain't got to prove nothing it just is what it is so the more you eat the more your thinking will begin to change not your head thinking but your heart thinking where you begin to believe because you've been digesting on the word of God you've been ruminating on the word of God and not on that filth of the world that will make you think that way which is what brother Brandon was framing up in that sermon from last Sunday Christianity versus idolatry you think about the world and you're going to start thinking your your character will Express the world but you think and meditate upon the word of God and you will begin to express the characteristics of the word of God is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church and brother I just put together just a list of these things that brother random said that about about this topic from from different places and if you want the exact reference I can I'm happy to pull that but I just for to save some space I just kind of scrunched them all together here but he said remember this and never forget it and and you'll notice how many times he said about this we have the mind of Christ he said remember this over and over again like like he's trying to call out to the church this is like it's really important the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass what what's the right mental attitude like like like Jesus coming to Martha there at the grave of Lazarus and she didn't berate him or anything she just said Lord if you'd have been here and and you uh like the little woman there at Jesus's feet washing his feet she didn't care about all the the naysayers and the scoffers but she was there to Humble yourself and wash his feet the right mental attitude is Abraham saying I I don't care how many years have passed the right mental attitude is Moses I don't care if I don't have an army behind me I'm going down and I'm taking over what God has promised the right mental attitude is looking soberly and steadfastly at the word of God and ignoring anything that's contrary and saying if God said it if God promised healing for my body salvation for my children that I'm going to lay hold of that promise and ignore anything contrary to that the right mental attitude towards any promise of God he said I've seen sarcomas cancer healed by the right mental attitude toward go towards God's Divine word if you'll believe it accept it in another place he said if you'll take the right mental attitude towards anything God has promised God's under obligation to see that you get it that's right because he promised it now see that's frame up your attitude instead of saying oh well I guess I'm just going to have to walk away from it you your your thinking is changed to where you're like God promised it so I ain't backing down from this Faith goes out and grabs it and takes it and it'll stay there until you get it and won't give up because you know that if God promised he's under obligation to see that you get it and now listen to this closely any Divine promise of God see there's another place where he said listen listen to this closely any Divine promise of God the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can look at it right and believe it in that way that it's written say God is your word and take the right mental attitude towards that Divine promise it'll bring it to pass because there's no defeat faith cannot be defeated there's no defeat to Faith where's all this coming from in Mark 11 verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them see that's framing up your thinking when you pray that you're not just praying some to like just to do it but you're praying with confidence that what you speak is going to happen and you're not coming begging but you're laying your petition before God and saying I believe that you're going to answer and I believe that you're going to do it and I'm coming in faith and that will have the same result he's saying as as speaking to a mountain speaking to the figure Tre and it will the word will accomplish his purpose in Hebrews 11 Paul said without faith it is a Poss is it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so all of these things are speaking of the right mental attitude we have the mind of Christ Our thinking has been changed and brother R will say now you can take me on record as it's on tape I make this statement tonight and remember this there's another place where he's saying remember that if you will take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise that God has made it'll come to pass if you can take the right mental attitude towards any of God's Divine promises he will bring it to pass and another place he said and may I stop here just a moment to say this and I'll go on record because the recorders are going that any Divine promise in God's word if you take the right mental attitude towards any of God's Divine promises will bring it to pass regard regardless of what it is if God promised it and you show the right mental attitude God will fulfill his promise to you that promise is good to anyone who will look at it in that respect brother Bob it seems like you're belaboring this point yes I'm trying to drill it in drill it in real good that if you believe God he's going to do it right now aren't you aren't you glad we've got a god like that that didn't just uh he's not like a father that doesn't keep his promises or you know a dad beat dad or something but he he's he's a God that will keep what he promised he said now look Martha had read that story no doubt and she knew of God was in Elijah surely he would be in his son her brother was dead but she wanted to see Jesus here she goes she didn't come out to scold him she come out to worship him and she come running out she fell down at his feet and said now watch how she approaches God she fell down at his feet to worship not to scold him CU he didn't come do what she wanted to do she come right she come in the right minut mental attitude that's the way you've got to come you've got to come in to him that way in the right mental attitude now see how can how can I apply that to my own life what what what if what if something happens in my life that that I don't like something unexpected a relative passes away that dog passes away or something you come to God and you say well I don't understand and you start brating him or whatever or or or you maybe you lose your job or something that doesn't happen the way you expect it to well why don't you frame it up right with the right attitude and come to God I don't understand why these things happen but I know that you do all all you work everything for the good of those that love you and so and you begin to look at things differently and you're coming with a different kind of attitude I I I want I want whatever this circumstance is to change me and and regardless of what the circumstance is I know that you're still God and you're able to you're able to back up your word and you're able to to to meet the need that I have so if you've lost your job God God is able ble to frame it up so he'll give you another one a better one it it whatever circumstances in life God is doing it for your good so look at it look at it with the right attitude with faith and belief and he said oh watch she's at the right place before the right person sorrow heart her poor eyes was stre beautiful girl I guess and oh her eyes were stre the bread winner was gone her brother was dead he was buried been dead four days already skin worms in his body said if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now I like that even now whatever you ask God God will do it even now Lord he's dead been dead 4 days why he's stinking but even now whatever you ask God God will give it to you that's right our thinkings changed who ha known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him how can you know uh a a a a God that lives alone in the seventh Dimension that surpasses all our understanding all of our anything that we could hope to understand but but then God gives you his mind and and slowly you begin to understand the Mysteries and things that seem past understanding and and he he he shapes your thinking to look at things different look what brother R said he said when he speaks it's got to be perfect we can't alter God's word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking let the mind of Christ be in you then you'll think like he think things another place he he said so there is genuine Faith but you must come into the real channel of God to have that genuine Faith there's human Faith then there's faith of God and you must have a Godly Faith to believe now then to have Godly Faith you must have the mind of Christ in you then that's how God projects to you Visions Revelations and all these things comes by the mind of Christ Christ being in you you get it let the mind that was in Christ be in you now see when the when the mind of Christ we we're sitting around over the last week just talking about things that are happening around the message when the mind of Christ is in you that's why you have a minister go down the aisle and point at somebody and say I know what's going on in your life and it'll be true a minister on the platform turn and look at somebody playing the organ I know what's happening in your life and speak directly to the situation it's because somebody's getting in the channel where the mind of Christ is actually active in the church it's it's why you can go to somebody in your family and if the Lord is dealing with you like like he would say in the statute of a perfect man those men waited until they got a nudge from God and then they went and did because it's the mind of Christ working in you see then it becomes so you can go and talk and words of encouragement to your family or something because you're led to do that because the mind of Christ is working in you and then it's not just education and lectures and things but it's actually a something Supernatural happening where God is working in the body of Believers now that's genuine Faith to to take God's word and ignore anything contrary he said we have faith in our heart the faith of God in our heart and can see it clear it becomes a faith and then we speak it and it comes into existence the same thing because the mind of Christ is in the man that's what makes healings and so forth oh you you think if you're thinking like God's word says and you speak whatever you speak will actually Express and become reality if you need healing in your body say Lord I believe that you're going to heal me I believe you already have he said you can't have the mind of Christ and the mind of the world at the same time you can't be in your way in God's way at the same time you have to get out of your own way to let God have his way that's the only way you're ever going to do anything you got to get away from your own thoughts your own reasons don't try to reason just believe he said here is the secret the word is in the bride this is that quote we love to quote the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord then it is deratization coming in you'll be denominational pregnated but if you let the mind of Christ come into you he can't deny his own word because he's God and they say Billy you lost your mind maybe I did but I found the mind of Christ what's he talking about he's talking about the person of Jesus Christ will come and live in you and it because God is there he makes you start being magnetized to the world and and withdraw from the world he changes the way that you're looking at things and this was why Paul in in in chapter 3 he starts he starts hammering again on their baby isness that he did in the first chapter he he gets on that again he says and I Brethren I couldn't speak to you as unto spiritual but as as unto carnal you're you're looking at things the wrong way you you're not looking at things the right way even as unto babes in Christ now now look at how he frames up what a baby is I fed you with milk a not with meat for hither to you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are ye able for ye are get carnal for where is there is among you envying and strifing divisions are you not carnal and walk as men in other words they didn't have their eye on Christ but they were making all these divisions and and and saying who's who's who's better and who's this and that and and why why were they doing that because they were looking at men instead of Christ right while one saith I am of Paul and another I am of Apollos are you not carnal who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man you think you know if you really frame up what a Ministry is it's almost something to uh it's it's something to help but it's almost kind of something to just maybe this is not the right way to say it but to just be discarded you you use the minister you come to church the minister preaches to you but if you put too much emphasis on the minister like there doing then you're going down the wrong way and you know I just just kind of talking maybe this is just an observation but over the years you watch different churches and things start off and and the people in the church they'll start getting like like the mystery that like things begin to unfold to them and they'll they'll immediately think well this is the only place you can go to get it and they'll and and and and and then not realizing that all around the message the same truth is being preached and see see Paul is actually saying this is actually an Evidence of of a little carnal baby church because they're not relying on CH they're not they're not looking at their own Revelation but instead they're looking at at at a man because I I'm I'm going to tell you you know as the Mysteries begin to unfold if this if there's a group that the Seven Seals are being unfolded and you begin to understand the Capstone Mysteries and you come through the breach uh past uh past brotherly kindness until that super anointing is moved moving in your life you you're not looking at a man anymore like that but you're looking at the word and the word is what has captivated your life and see who what what Paul is saying who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man God gives to everybody ministers it's his holy ghost working through the ministers to speak to you but it's the holy ghost that is the main thing that Christ is the main thing not the man behind the pulpit that we want to have pulpit Ministries and special Ministries and things where with that that actually caus division and why does it cause division because you get instead of looking at the word you start looking at well I I believe this person I believe this person and it causes these divisions and and everybody starts labeling one another well this person goes to this church this person is of Paul this person is sephus and it creates these divisions that where if we would in stay do like they did on the day of Pentecost and look with one Accord at the word that's how they got in one Accord look at look it straight at the word of God not at all the different divisions and things why are you belaboring this brother Bob because Paul did we're just going through the scripture so don't get upset at me if I say these things but get upset at Paul so look what he's saying for while one saith I of Paul and another I am of Apollos are you not carnal who then is Paul and who is Apollos but ministers by whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man so if you want to really Digest what what he's saying here as we're about to close the Corinthians were dividing themselves based on allegiance to different leaders treating these ministers as Rivals rather than Servants of the same God so this actually was an attribute of their immature worldly mindset it was God who worked through them to bring the Corinthians to Faith and all credit honor glory belongs to him not the ministers yeah I think that kind of goes along with some of the thoughts that brother William was expressing when he was here you know you'll get you'll get praise but you got to let it roll off cuz it ain't about the minister it's about it's about what God is doing in the people that's actually in that sermon why Christ speak where brother Adam said that Satan is trying was trying to get uh he was trying to to keep the people from from realizing what they had because if the word that Moses believed was could get Out Among the people and then they could realize it's the people it's not the it's not about the minister the minister is just a a vessel that God uses to speak so Paul would continue that thought in verse 6 he said I planted Apollos watered but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything Nei neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase what's the one that plants that Paul laid that Foundation like he literally laid the foundation down through the seven churches ages but then if you add if you keep adding on to that more like if you water and keep growing it it it to so that the church and your so that your characteristics can produce your watering but still neither is anything it's the Holy Ghost so you can't make the minister anything now he that planteth and he that WTH are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor and we'll stop on this for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry husbandry ye are God's Building according to the grace of God which has given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another builth their own but let every man take heed how he builth there upon for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ it all comes back back to Jesus Christ that's the main thing God bless you Saints [Applause]
