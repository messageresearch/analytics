[0:00] right and brother Bram said I was going
[0:03] to go and shoot him or do something to
[0:05] him he said but I L him to the Lord and
[0:07] converted him and he's a Christian now
[0:11] so the
[0:13] difference the boy at 12 with no
[0:16] leadership of the Lord right and a man
[0:18] at say 40 years old with the Holy Ghost
[0:21] and coming up the statute of a perfect
[0:23] man look at the
[0:24] difference he said I prayed for his
[0:27] sinful Soul right so you see the
[0:30] difference and that's the same way we
[0:31] are all should be boy a lot of us going
[0:34] to fall off before we get started aren't
[0:35] we see then we wonder why God is not in
[0:37] his
[0:38] church cuz we don't have
[0:41] Temperance huh doing Miracles and things
[0:43] that they you that they used to do yes
[0:45] sir
[0:48] see add these things add Temperance to
[0:50] it oh Temperance how to answer in
[0:52] kindness when wrath is spoke to you now
[0:56] that gets a lot of it mhm
[1:01] somebody say you a bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:03] down there don't jump out and roll up
[1:05] your sleeves see now not that but talk
[1:08] with Godly love Temperance
[1:11] kindness is that the way you want to be
[1:13] turn says amen when you're red upon R
[1:16] not back let him be ex your example in
[1:19] other words Jesus
[1:21] Christ they say if thou be the Son of
[1:23] God turn these stones into bread he
[1:25] could have done it and show he was God
[1:27] but he had Temperance when he called him
[1:29] Bells above he said said I'll forgive
[1:30] you for this that's right they pulled
[1:32] handfuls of beard out of his face and
[1:34] spit in his face and said come down off
[1:36] the cross he said father forgive them
[1:38] they don't even know what they're doing
[1:40] when he had the gift he knowed all
[1:41] things for in him was the fullness of
[1:42] the godhead B they had seen him perform
[1:44] Miracles by telling people what was
[1:46] wrong with him and so forth like that
[1:47] they put a rag around his head around
[1:49] his
[1:51] eyes hit him in the head with a stick
[1:53] said prophesy tell us who hit you we'll
[1:55] believe you see he had Temperance now if
[1:58] you got it like that to your faith if
[2:01] you still blow up in SASS and fuss and
[2:03] stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't got
[2:06] no you can't add that cuz it won't add
[2:08] St it won't
[2:11] vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of
[2:13] rubber and vulcanize it to a piece of
[2:14] iron it just won't work that's got to be
[2:17] flexible just like the rubber is see and
[2:19] when your faith and your Temperance
[2:21] becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost
[2:23] Temperance that he had then it will
[2:25] vulcanize with him you're adding added
[2:27] to it when your virtue is like his virt
[2:30] then you add to it when your knowledge
[2:32] is like his knowledge I come to do thy
[2:34] will oh God see with the father's word
[2:35] he defeated every devil Heaven and Earth
[2:38] will pass away but the word will not see
[2:40] when you got that kind of knowledge
[2:41] it'll vulcanize with your faith you see
[2:43] what he's talking about faith is rubber
[2:47] so all these virtues are
[2:50] rubber but if you're if you don't have
[2:52] faith and you're that
[2:54] rock you know like Ezekiel says you got
[2:56] a Stony heart well a Stony heart in a
[2:58] heart of Flesh you can't vulcanize those
[3:01] together but if you got a heart of
[3:04] Flesh and you got flesh you got Rubber
[3:07] and you got rubber do you know you can
[3:09] vulcanize that rubber together and
[3:10] that's what we used to do with the old
[3:11] Tire Cube I know Danny and brother Joe
[3:13] and some of the older ones remember U
[3:16] Brother Ray brother Bob probably don't
[3:17] he never changed the tire in his life
[3:19] probably call Triple
[3:22] A we called s swd s your way
[3:26] Dale didn't we but you take that tire to
[3:29] you
[3:30] and you put some glue on it but what
[3:32] would you do you heat it you take a
[3:35] torch or even we used to take just an
[3:36] old match heat it with a match cuz that
[3:39] hey bicycles is the only way we had to
[3:40] get around and if we had a flat
[3:43] absolutely and if we had a flat tire
[3:45] that means our ride was gone so we took
[3:48] that tube off we found the hole fill it
[3:51] up put in some water and watch where the
[3:53] bubbles come up take and scratch that
[3:55] thing off real good and you could buy
[3:57] patches they were not paper patches
[4:00] they were
[4:01] not wood
[4:03] patches duct tape they were not duct
[4:06] tape duct tape will hold but it won't
[4:08] hold forever but if you those patches
[4:11] were made out of rubber right the P the
[4:14] the tube was rubber you clean that thing
[4:16] off you'd strike a masch and you'd heat
[4:18] that thing up just about as hot as you
[4:20] can get before it melted slap your a
[4:22] little glue on it when you stuck that
[4:24] patch on you couldn't get it off could
[4:26] you it actually was stronger than the
[4:29] tub around it wasn't it so that's what
[4:31] God's got if if you've
[4:33] got rubberized like brother Brown said
[4:36] vulcanized if you're Rubber and God
[4:38] brings the patch cuz every once in a
[4:41] while we do blow a
[4:42] fuse we blow a hole out of our
[4:45] tube what does God do he says well I got
[4:47] a patch but the patch is not paper and
[4:50] your rubber or he's rubber in your paper
[4:53] it's got to be the holy ghost that you
[4:56] have and you say Okay God I can't handle
[4:58] this on my own
[5:00] he said okay I may heat you up a little
[5:04] bit yeah he may heat you up a little bit
[5:07] CU you know what he's going to test what
[5:09] you got not for his business but for
[5:13] yours Moses brother B said he wanted to
[5:16] know if he had the right man well that's
[5:19] what the prophet said but I think God
[5:22] wanted Moses to know that Moses was the
[5:24] right man right so he could trust in God
[5:27] and that's why you got to doal with
[5:28] these virtues and next Sunday we'll go
[5:29] will still still be on Temperance and
[5:31] we'll start right
[5:33] here be who you
[5:35] are but if you got a change make it a
[5:39] Godly
[5:40] change
[5:43] right that God could work with and it
[5:46] wasn't just his heart part it was his
[5:48] inner
[5:50] being and I believe if David would have
[5:52] been able to be born again he would have
[5:54] been mightier than he was but it's it's
[5:59] it's actually ashamed that he lived the
[6:01] way he lived and we live the way we live
[6:02] and we've got the Holy Ghost and he
[6:04] didn't that's
[6:07] uh that's the way I see it for all the
[6:09] ones in the Old
[6:12] Testament is that we should all be
[6:14] ashamed of Our
[6:17] Lives
[6:19] amen right okay all right
[6:22] let's start
[6:25] with Temperance you got that on okay all
[6:30] right good to have each and every one of
[6:31] you here like I said remember Mom in
[6:33] prayer
[6:35] um she's probably watching in this
[6:37] morning but not feeling good in her body
[6:41] um and just by way of announcements I
[6:44] want to let you know we're going to be
[6:45] gone probably a week and a half after
[6:47] Christmas so uh and we'll also be gone
[6:51] Sunday December the 1st so brother Joe's

[7:59] can't to talk to mon yeah the fifth is
[8:02] that next Sunday I have to let get back
[8:03] to you on
[8:06] that brother Joe just be
[8:10] ready
[8:14] no maybe Brother Ray have something to
[8:16] say during that
[8:19] time maybe Ryan would have something to
[8:24] say huh brother
[8:27] R talk about Brother Ray one of those r
[8:30] r or yeah Ray or r one of the two all
[8:33] right let's go fourthly brother Brown
[8:36] talking about we'll have to hurry what
[8:38] we're now is we're on Temperance now we
[8:40] talked about knowledge a little bit last
[8:42] Sunday and spoke a few minutes about
[8:45] Temperance now remember
[8:47] knowledge knowledge remember is not
[8:50] worldly knowledge has nothing to do with
[8:54] how smart you
[8:55] are that's right now it does
[9:00] have something to do with what you can
[9:06] comprehend it does have something to do
[9:08] with what you can comprehend cuz when
[9:10] the Holy Ghost comes he brings the word
[9:12] well you're going to have to put
[9:13] yourself available you can't just say
[9:16] I'm dumb Lord you're just going to have
[9:18] to do everything now come on people
[9:19] that's that's not that's over on the
[9:21] other side I I like to be in the middle
[9:25] uh some people over here in the Stream
[9:26] you you know you got to know your Greek
[9:28] your Hebrew through and you got to know
[9:30] how to recite the Bible backwards that's
[9:33] worldly knowledge Satan has that kind of
[9:35] knowledge he can quote the Bible he was
[9:37] there when it was written he's here now
[9:39] and he he's knows it better than we do
[9:44] but then you take the people over on
[9:45] this side that says well I'm just God
[9:48] said brother R said even the most
[9:50] ignorant person can receive the Holy
[9:51] Ghost well that's exactly the
[9:53] truth but I'll promise you one thing you
[9:56] receive the true Holy Ghost and you put
[9:57] yourself available for the word you'll
[9:59] become
[10:01] smart you'll become smart in the ways of
[10:04] God right and even without the ability
[10:07] to read you know even without the
[10:09] ability to read remember that old man
[10:11] that went fishing with that boy and you
[10:13] know the little boy didn't um he went to
[10:15] the Sunday school class and they said
[10:17] well you can't see God you can't see
[10:18] this you can't see that and he asked his
[10:20] mama and his mama said go ask your daddy
[10:21] and his daddy said go ask somebody you
[10:23] know so he goes out fishing with that
[10:25] old man and he asked the old man he
[10:27] said where's God
[10:29] have you ever seen God he said Son every
[10:33] day I live I see God well now he didn't
[10:35] see him in a
[10:36] textbook he saw him in a revelation of
[10:39] the sun coming up the sun going down
[10:41] nature uh the plants the flowers the
[10:44] trees I was thinking coming from hunting
[10:47] yesterday I
[10:48] thought all these trees come from one
[10:52] place how can you not see a Divine
[10:55] Providence of a of a Creator right that
[10:59] put everything in the earth that we
[11:01] needed because there's nothing new Under
[11:02] the Sun everything we needed he put in
[11:04] this earth in the Book of Genesis this
[11:06] computer was in the Book of Genesis
[11:08] because it comes from
[11:10] plastic which is in the earth nothing
[11:13] comes from above it all comes from down
[11:15] here right everybody understand what I'm
[11:17] talking about so the Providence of God
[11:18] was I'm going remember the Bible says
[11:21] the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the
[11:23] Earth the Sea and the sky everything
[11:27] Earth sea and sky there's nothing left
[11:28] besides that
[11:30] that's all you got the Earth SE and sky
[11:31] and he said his knowledge would fill
[11:34] that up so you don't have to be a rocket
[11:35] scientist and know you know know how
[11:38] that that the U plant photosynthesizes
[11:41] in the summertime and turns it into
[11:43] chloroform and you don't have to know
[11:46] that you just look and say God you
[11:48] resurrected this plant who told that and
[11:51] that's what I was thinking yesterday
[11:52] coming I thought who told that
[11:55] plant who told that plant
[11:59] to take all of its sap and run it down
[12:01] into the
[12:03] roots so that it can survive the winter
[12:05] cuz that's what it is it survives the
[12:07] winter by having its life down here in
[12:09] the roofs now who tells it that well God
[12:12] did he said it before the when he
[12:14] created the world and it hadn't changed
[12:16] since and same way with the animals who
[12:19] who tells the the bird to fly south for
[12:22] the winter
[12:23] time well it gets cold and there's a
[12:25] chemical reaction and this happens in
[12:27] the you know same way with the deer this
[12:29] when the sunlight when the days get
[12:31] shorter the photosynth or the um um
[12:36] eyeballs the cuticles and all that
[12:38] changes in a deer well that causes it to
[12:41] start into its mating season because of
[12:43] the shortening of the days it has
[12:44] nothing to do with anything else it's
[12:46] just that the daylight sun in that
[12:48] deer's eyes changes the chemical
[12:51] reaction in its body and it becomes able
[12:53] to reproduce now you don't have to
[12:56] understand every little aspect but you
[12:58] can just look and say God
[13:00] you did all this he's the master
[13:03] architect so that's why I say about
[13:05] knowledge we don't have to have worldly
[13:07] knowledge as far as will you say well
[13:09] you're smart and I'm dumb if you both
[13:12] got the Holy Ghost it's not a dumb Holy
[13:14] Ghost and a smart Holy Ghost everybody
[13:15] understand what I'm saying and I don't
[13:17] believe the Lord is bothered with saying
[13:19] that because he puts it in you and you
[13:22] know what he does he uses that
[13:24] character just like this tree is a pine
[13:26] and this one is an oak and this one is a
[13:28] popular and this in his an Elm he uses
[13:30] you and and brother CLA brought that out
[13:33] the other day he said be who you
[13:37] are CU sometimes you say well I wish I
[13:39] could be quiet well God didn't want me
[13:44] quiet sure there's things we got to
[13:46] overcome in the Statue of a perfect man
[13:48] but there's no way I could be like
[13:49] sister barbar no I would burst my
[13:53] eyeballs would fall out I mean it
[13:56] just but see that's a characteristic
[13:59] that sometimes I wished I
[14:01] had cuz the Bible says Be Still every
[14:04] time I see her I kind of think in my
[14:05] mind be still and know that I am God cuz
[14:07] she's she's real meticulous in her
[14:09] movement and you know some of us are
[14:11] just hky jerky and run all over the
[14:13] place and poor brother Jim pinking out
[14:15] in wit he just a mess and he knows it so
[14:18] I'm not saying anything he doesn't know
[14:20] he's a when you eat around him you're in
[14:21] a splatter
[14:24] Zone when he talks you if you're sitting
[14:27] across from him no one thinks for sure
[14:29] you're going to be eating what he's
[14:30] eating but see that's just the way he is
[14:33] he likes to talk and he shovels his food
[14:34] and he just talks and he just he goes
[14:36] everywhere but that's a trait what I'm
[14:38] saying is that's a characteristic that
[14:40] that the statue of a perfect man is not
[14:41] going to take out of him that's not
[14:43] going to he's not going to One Day
[14:44] become so humble that he doesn't that's
[14:46] not it try not what I'm trying to say is
[14:48] is try not to so much say well God I'm
[14:52] I'm just a big mouth and I need to
[14:53] change well yeah you need to maybe have
[14:56] a little patience and all that watch
[14:58] what you're saying watch what you're
[14:59] doing but God wants your
[15:03] character or he wouldn't have put you
[15:06] here with that genetic
[15:10] trait black people sings very well I
[15:14] love the way they sing and the way they
[15:16] worship God loves that that's why he put
[15:19] it in you to do that you know us us
[15:22] white people we can't when we're doing
[15:23] this you're supposed to be doing that
[15:25] you know you just be way off beat and
[15:27] then black people they just
[15:29] you know and you know what they do
[15:31] though if you would have took that if
[15:34] you would have took that and used it for
[15:36] the glory of the Lord you wouldn't have
[15:37] all these rappers and all that stuff out
[15:39] here that's just that's just degrading
[15:42] the nation with their junk the black
[15:44] people and the white people but take the
[15:46] take the desire that God give that group
[15:49] of people you understand what I'm saying
[15:51] take that desire that's what we're
[15:53] talking about the statute of perfect man
[15:54] you don't have to say well I'm going to
[15:55] pick one of these virtues and then I'm
[15:57] going to really excel in that virtue now
[15:59] God wants you to be well balanced in the
[16:02] virtues but some of you are going to
[16:05] have I don't believe sister Bara would
[16:07] get mad if you went over there and just
[16:08] slapped her right in the face she
[16:10] wouldn't get mad now well she said she
[16:15] might let me put it this way there would
[16:18] be a different reaction if I slapped her
[16:20] than I slapped
[16:24] Susan now that's a
[16:27] contrast praise the Lord anyhow brother
[16:32] you know it
[16:34] brother now do you see what I mean yeah
[16:37] I believe they're both Christian women
[16:39] you understand what I'm saying I know
[16:41] better though than to slap
[16:43] Su if I had my pick I'd slap just
[16:47] Barber but I'm not going to slap either
[16:49] one of them but you understand what I'm
[16:51] saying you see why this character that
[16:52] we're building and I kind of want to
[16:54] take a few minutes today we're on number
[16:56] three 1 2 3 and we're
[16:59] I don't want us to
[17:01] become um zombies right I don't we need
[17:06] to live our life the way God intended
[17:09] now look there's things that come in
[17:11] that we don't need to have you
[17:13] understand that because the devil's
[17:14] right
[17:15] there but when what brother Dale is
[17:17] preaching now you we got to realize that
[17:19] just weaves right into the statue of a
[17:21] perfect man cuz they receive the Seal of
[17:23] God in their forehead not exactly the
[17:26] knowledge but do you know every one of
[17:27] these virtues comes right through
[17:31] here you don't get virtue from your
[17:35] hand The Virtue that you have flows
[17:38] through that hand to either shake it or
[17:40] like you said you know punch somebody or
[17:41] shake their hand right but where does
[17:44] that come from that emulates from the
[17:45] inside person but you got to get it
[17:48] right here
[17:50] first where does knowledge come from
[17:52] right here where does temperance come
[17:54] from right here because your whole
[17:56] psyche is in your is in your mental
[17:58] capacity of thinking that's why I don't
[18:00] want us to be message zombies or
[18:03] Christian zombies where we have to be
[18:06] monks if you do that I promise you one
[18:09] thing you will fail right it will drive
[18:12] you crazy right and you will be a basket
[18:16] case but you know what I like Susan
[18:19] being outgoing cuz I'm outgoing and it's
[18:21] not that I don't like sister Barber but
[18:23] I can't carry on conversation with
[18:24] sister Barber cuz she just goes
[18:30] and then if she speaks I have to be
[18:31] right up close to her to hear her cuz
[18:33] she you you understand what I'm saying
[18:34] yeah so let's don't take our and and
[18:37] totally God wants to take care of our
[18:39] character but he put a certain trait in
[18:44] you you put a certain trait in you that
[18:47] he wants to use now there's the
[18:49] thing you can use it for his honor and
[18:52] Glory or you can use it to destroy your
[18:57] character and other
[19:00] right brother said if you destroy the
[19:02] man's influence you destroyed the man or
[19:03] if you killed the man's influence so
[19:05] that means if you stay what we're trying
[19:07] to do with this statute of a perfect man
[19:09] I just want to kind of like I said we're
[19:10] up number three to knowledge now we're
[19:11] going into Temperance I want us to
[19:13] realize don't fight the
[19:16] thing now brother BR said you'll fight
[19:18] your nature brother Bram said you'll be
[19:20] sticky and that's true cuz Satan is
[19:23] right there ready to give back to you
[19:25] what you give to
[19:27] him so there is a Bible greatest battle
[19:30] ever Fs in the mind right right here so
[19:34] what you filter through today I don't
[19:36] want you from from the time now all the
[19:38] way up through even to Godliness when
[19:40] we're up to Godliness sure we're
[19:42] supposed to act like God and we're
[19:43] supposed to be Christians and people are
[19:45] supposed to realize that we are
[19:47] different but realize one
[19:50] thing black people are always going to
[19:52] be black white people always going to be
[19:54] white you're going to have that trait of
[19:55] singing and and worship stay with that
[19:59] stay with that remember what brother
[20:01] rown said he talked about Martin Luther
[20:02] King and and the white people he said
[20:05] you need to Martin Luther King needs to
[20:06] leave the people alone he said the black
[20:08] people are even he didn't say smarter he
[20:10] said but they educate their people
[20:12] better cuz you have a culture there that
[20:14] you you want to filter that culture down
[20:16] there's nothing wrong with it if you use
[20:18] it
[20:18] right so brother randam was against he
[20:21] he wasn't a
[20:24] segregation but he wanted them to keep
[20:27] separate that's right right he he never
[20:30] wanted he said you integr he said you're
[20:31] going to cause a war and it did you know
[20:33] it caused a battle there in the 60s but
[20:35] you understand what I'm saying don't
[20:37] fight who you
[20:38] are in the terms of God you made me like
[20:42] this you know what a housewife with the
[20:45] Holy Ghost is just as important as a
[20:49] preacher cuz what she does with those
[20:51] children nurturing those children is a
[20:55] foundation to get that child of
[20:57] Christianity and oh how we wish we had
[21:00] went over time to go
[21:02] over we would have done it different
[21:04] because we weren't born again when our
[21:06] children were coming up but see you know
[21:08] what that wasn't a surprise to God
[21:11] either but now we live the life that we
[21:13] hope that we can let the children see us
[21:16] and then want to become like us um
[21:19] that's why I saying about now we come
[21:20] into
[21:22] Temperance husband and wife going to
[21:24] have
[21:25] arguments children are going to hear it
[21:28] but you know what it's what happens
[21:31] afterwards it's what happens
[21:34] afterwards show
[21:37] affection do the things you're supposed
[21:39] to do as Christians there are basic
[21:42] foundational things that we're supposed
[21:43] to do supposed to love our
[21:45] wife supp to love our wife and comfort
[21:49] her right and you know what Jesus said
[21:52] he'd be a comforter to the Widow so we
[21:55] got all that everything's covered but
[21:56] you got to believe that we' got to
[21:58] believe that whatever we want to get rid
[22:00] of remember I was talking about doors
[22:02] indoors brother said God you let God
[22:06] in in the inner part of your soul right
[22:09] but there's still doors in your house
[22:12] that you keep closed and the doorknobs
[22:14] on your side
[22:16] still the Holy Ghost will absolutely
[22:18] stand
[22:20] there and not go anywhere if you don't L
[22:24] he's a gentleman my brother Brown said I
[22:26] go back to that but brother Brown didn't
[22:28] didn't just say that for for for filling
[22:31] up
[22:32] tape he said the Holy Ghost is
[22:34] timid so it's got a nature the Holy
[22:37] Ghost has got a nature itself that's the
[22:39] Holy Ghost nature but now he's not going
[22:41] to take that and just pour it out if you
[22:44] don't want it right we're back to free
[22:47] moral agency there's no I was reading
[22:48] quotes yesterday brother brand right up
[22:51] to his 1965 he never did away with free
[22:54] moral agency even after you're born
[22:56] again you are a free moral agent you can
[22:58] do whatever you want to
[23:01] do and the Holy Ghost will go remember
[23:04] how he made the illustration how the
[23:05] Holy Ghost would go back to the father
[23:07] now of course illustration we don't
[23:08] believe in three Gods but the Holy Ghost
[23:11] Jesus Jesus Christ in the form of the
[23:13] Holy Ghost or God whichever one you want
[23:15] to say in the form of the Holy Ghost
[23:16] comes into you at the new birth right
[23:19] burns out the old nature puts his nature
[23:22] in and you beg you become your you begin
[23:24] your journey as a
[23:26] Christian right but at that
[23:30] time you can
[23:32] say don't know I just that door right
[23:35] there I don't want to be messing with
[23:37] that room in my house and you know what
[23:40] God will say okay but you'll never get
[23:43] the promises that are affiliated with
[23:46] that that's the problem you won't get
[23:48] the promises that are affiliated
[23:53] brother brother
[23:55] Dale he come to a place to where we
[23:58] believe that that that God's used a man
[24:02] um I believe he's a a manifested Son of
[24:04] God I believe he he's he lives what he
[24:07] preaches and he preached what he
[24:09] lives there's no question about that
[24:12] right all right so see that standard to
[24:14] me you don't have to say well I got to
[24:16] be like brother
[24:17] Dale you can't do that right if anybody
[24:21] can I'm the closest cuz I got his
[24:23] genetic makeup me and Terence and Anna
[24:25] we be close we be close
[24:29] we be
[24:30] close we are
[24:32] close we I'm talking like you
[24:39] now but we're we're the closest to it
[24:42] because we're genetically made up like
[24:43] the man personally but you know what
[24:46] Terence and I and Anna could be just as
[24:49] rotten as rotten could be without the
[24:52] Holy
[24:54] Ghost the Holy Ghost we're rotten as we
[24:57] can be I don't care who you are Billy
[24:59] Paul Joseph Brandon family I don't care
[25:03] who it is I was reading yesterday
[25:05] brother brand said this is an individual
[25:06] Affair he said I don't care if your
[25:08] mother and father were the most Saed
[25:10] people in the
[25:13] world in the world he said he said you
[25:17] have got to make a choice all right so
[25:20] and see that's why we don't want to lean
[25:22] on you say well my Mom and Daddy was
[25:24] drunk or my mom and daddy were divorced
[25:27] or my mom
[25:29] so sure there's things that you
[25:32] carry like I said there's traits that
[25:34] you carry but let's try to use that for
[25:37] the glory of God all right try to use
[25:40] that for God and and then ask God to
[25:42] help
[25:42] you and I believe you will asking you
[25:46] shall receive seeking you shall find
[25:47] knocking it shall be open okay cut your
[25:50] hand up yeah well
[25:52] the we all go through different trials
[25:56] different Temptations so we go we grow
[25:59] differently that's correct and the other
[26:02] thing is ear on on the intelligence we
[26:06] read a quot from Brother Dale whatever
[26:10] the devil uses to catch you the same way
[26:13] that's correct
[26:14] same prop God will use contact that's
[26:18] right and is on that Maniac that not
[26:21] Maniac the guy in Oregon who wanted to
[26:24] be the guy oh yeah the big guy yeah
[26:26] couldn't be delivered because want cuz
[26:29] he liked it he he wanted that now
[26:31] brother BR cast it out but it came back
[26:34] brother Bram cast that demon out of that
[26:36] man remember the man that was going to
[26:37] kill brother brand come up to him was
[26:39] going to kill him he said he knew he
[26:40] could he cast The Demon out of him but
[26:43] if you'll look about two or three
[26:44] messages later he's referring back to it
[26:47] and and somebody must have asked him
[26:49] well did the guy get rid of it he said
[26:51] no he liked that spirit so it came back
[26:53] on it that's the same way with healing
[26:56] brother Brown say you get healed of
[26:57] cancer the cancer dies what about a man
[26:59] that could sit there and tell you what
[27:00] goes on inside your
[27:02] body with a seventh grade education but
[27:06] what did he do he used God's instrument
[27:08] of the word and the knowledge of God
[27:10] give him to say hey that cancer is a
[27:12] life and when it dies you still got the
[27:14] flesh there that flesh is going to ride
[27:16] you're going to get sicker he said if
[27:18] you don't continue believing he said
[27:20] that spirit will come back into that now
[27:23] if you want to read that in the
[27:24] scripture it's in Matthew where it says
[27:25] the unclean Spirit goes out of a man we
[27:27] we use as a new birth but you need to
[27:30] also use that as other things even this
[27:32] unclean Spirit goes out of a man W in
[27:34] dry places seeketh rest find us none
[27:37] comes back finds it swept and garnished
[27:39] in other words finds it cleaned out but
[27:42] if you don't let God in and get Godly
[27:45] Temperance Satan's going to bring that
[27:46] old temper right
[27:48] back seven times
[27:53] worse that's just the way it
[27:55] is and you're already filled with the
[27:57] Holy Ghost
[28:00] but we're not completely
[28:02] sealed in our
[28:04] forehead that's what's been going on
[28:06] that's why people have been dying when
[28:08] you get sealed in your forehead when you
[28:10] come to where that love that Capstone
[28:11] comes down so you got to be ready for it
[28:14] to come down on we're not going up to
[28:19] it Christ is coming down here right he's
[28:22] coming to get us and we're going to
[28:23] connect and we're going with him but
[28:25] he's got to come down here
[28:28] right brother Brown said the Capstone
[28:30] comes down all
[28:33] right so we we got to be ready down here
[28:36] when what I'm saying is we can't be
[28:38] ready in the Millennium right you got to
[28:40] be ready down here and the capstone's
[28:42] not going to fall on an individual that
[28:44] can't
[28:46] handle these
[28:49] virtues can I say one more sure you
[28:52] reminded said something tap
[28:56] that I do know how the rupture would be
[28:59] I was wondering how is this rupture
[29:00] going to be it's like a
[29:02] magnet big Holy Ghost if you have your
[29:05] holy GH if you do magneti that's right
[29:09] go
[29:10] up so you have to have it you have to
[29:13] have it that's correct and if you can't
[29:15] attain to all those virtues that's why
[29:17] people are dying and going by the grave
[29:20] that's why brother Del saw that I can
[29:22] say it just just plan his day we had a
[29:23] brother di yesterday brother Sammy
[29:25] kenzer just remember his family he's 59
[29:27] years old he was a pastor of the church
[29:29] in North Carolina I think Virginia and
[29:32] 59 years old went hunting with his
[29:33] grandkids fell over theread with a heart
[29:34] attack in
[29:36] woods so you never know that's right but
[29:40] God sees you come to a place and that's
[29:42] as far as you're going to go if you're a
[29:44] Christian best thing he can do is take
[29:45] you off the scene
[29:47] right won't be good for the
[29:50] family but we got to remember as
[29:52] Christians when God's finished with our
[29:54] work on Earth we don't want to be here
[29:56] anymore go back to to
[29:58] Hezekiah prayed for 15 more years watch
[30:01] brother brandham remember brother
[30:02] brandham with that we talked about the
[30:04] other day that sister Smith and he
[30:06] thought it was sister so and so shepher
[30:08] and Smith he got him mixed up and he
[30:10] went to praying for this one and this
[30:12] one died well see if he would have
[30:13] interceded for this one God knew if he
[30:16] would have interceded for this one he'd
[30:17] had to let that woman live that's how
[30:19] powerful that prophet's prayer was cuz
[30:22] the Bible said I mean the the angel said
[30:24] nothing will stand before you nothing
[30:27] not even cancer
[30:28] we'll stand before that man but you know
[30:30] what he came to a place though to where
[30:32] he had to be adopted he had to have the
[30:34] headstone message come which was the
[30:37] opening of the seventh seal which showed
[30:39] Redemption of this body so that's what
[30:42] we're trying to do we're trying to get
[30:43] to the Redemption of this body so we've
[30:47] come to a place to where now forly I
[30:50] just want to kind of give you that I
[30:51] want you to think about it I want you to
[30:53] you know chew it up digest it that don't
[30:58] try to make yourself change brother
[31:00] talks about it before this he says don't
[31:02] be a peacock I mean don't be a blackbird
[31:04] and start sticking peacock feathers in
[31:06] you somewhere along the line those
[31:08] feathers are going to fall
[31:09] out but you know it's like brother Claud
[31:12] said Sunday you know where you're at
[31:14] with God you're the only one that
[31:17] knows where you're at with God and
[31:20] brother Brown said you can know who you
[31:22] where you're at with God at any
[31:26] time what look into the the
[31:28] mirror look in the mirror that's right
[31:32] take the genetic
[31:33] code of the Holy Ghost this is genetic
[31:36] code of the Holy Ghost not all the David
[31:38] killed this one and had his best friend
[31:40] killed not that but take the life of
[31:43] Jesus Christ I know we all fall short of
[31:45] that but still we got to strive for it
[31:49] that's our
[31:50] goal if Christ is here he said he would
[31:54] make you live the life he Liv if you got
[31:57] the Holy Ghost
[31:58] and if you open yourself up to it make
[32:02] yourself available for the
[32:04] word god honored brother Brown said he's
[32:06] honor bound to keep his word all right
[32:10] so just for about five minutes let's
[32:12] talk about Temperance said fourthly
[32:14] we'll have to hurry because I'm just
[32:15] feel so good to stand here and talk
[32:16] about it Amen brother says we're
[32:18] enjoying it thank you add Temperance oh
[32:21] my we've come to Temperance now you've
[32:23] got faith first have to have that to
[32:26] begin with then you add virtue to your
[32:29] faith if it's the right kind of virtue
[32:31] do you hear that if it's the right kind
[32:32] of virtue then you add knowledge if it's
[32:35] the right kind of knowledge now you're
[32:36] going to add Temperance Temperance
[32:38] doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol cuz
[32:40] you should have done that at at Faith at
[32:44] the new birth all right that's what um
[32:47] brother Buster across the road here he
[32:48] said he said I really enjoyed that he
[32:50] said you got he said them Ain things
[32:52] those are things that the virtues are
[32:54] not things that a sinner is supposed to
[32:55] get rid
[32:56] of you should have got rid of the
[32:58] smoking the drinking the the the cussing
[33:01] the running around and all that when
[33:02] you've got the new
[33:04] birth actually if you want to be real
[33:06] honest about it in sanctification all
[33:09] that's supposed to go out the new birth
[33:12] just comes in and confirms that it is
[33:13] gone right so that kind of helped him
[33:17] and it should help all of us to see that
[33:19] that's that we're not trying to convert
[33:21] Christians up the statue of a perfect
[33:24] man we're not converting Christians up
[33:27] the statue of a perf man you understand
[33:28] what I'm saying we're getting Christians
[33:30] we're getting Sinners converted and then
[33:33] getting the Christians up the statue of
[33:34] a perfect man right all right so I like
[33:37] that that's a good quote Temperance
[33:40] doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here
[33:41] either no no Temperance doesn't mean
[33:43] alcoholic cure not in this case this is
[33:46] Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance
[33:49] that's just one of the lust of the flesh
[33:50] but we're talking about Holy Spirit
[33:52] Temperance that means how to control
[33:54] your tongue not be a toddler how to
[33:57] control your temper not fly off every
[34:00] time anybody speaks cross to you oh my
[34:03] boy a lot of us going to fall off before
[34:05] we get started aren't we see he must
[34:09] know that's a tough one cuz you know
[34:10] what you remember him he was Irish he
[34:14] said my mouth stayed
[34:15] busted the whole time I was a little kid
[34:19] he was going to kill those people those
[34:21] boys if God hadn't
[34:23] intervene at 22 he would have killed him
[34:26] cuz he was a crack shot and he was going
[34:28] to kill him cuz he pulled the trigger
[34:31] right everybody said oh well he no he
[34:33] pulled the
[34:35] trigger if you going to go kill somebody
[34:38] and you pull a trigger you going to
[34:40] expect something to go out the end of
[34:41] that barrel and it ain't going to be
[34:43] nice but God stopped every one of those
[34:45] bullets from going off remember he
[34:47] emptied the whole gun click click click
[34:49] and then he put them back in there and
[34:50] when they were all gone and when he got
[34:51] settled down and they
[34:53] just that wasn't coincidence that was
[34:57] God protect ing the gift that the man
[34:59] had right but it wasn't at that point he
[35:03] was not born
[35:06] again and he was
[35:08] mad he wasn't mad he was highly angry
[35:11] and
[35:14] murderous somebody say amen he was going
[35:17] to murder them
[35:19] boy I was God revealing himself kill him
[35:22] as well sure absolutely oh when he got
[35:24] finished he
[35:25] thought how low would you feel
[35:28] if you were 12 years old you had your
[35:30] gun and you were going to go kill
[35:31] somebody and you went click click click
[35:33] click and he was a crack shot people I
[35:34] mean he could shoot squirrels in the
[35:36] eyeball so he wasn't going to miss he
[35:38] didn't go out there to miss he went out
[35:40] there to kill them boys met him on the
[35:43] road remember he say he said I had
[35:44] intent to shoot them boy they killed his
[35:48] dog they killed his dog right yeah right
[35:51] but you know what if he' had a new birth
[35:53] he'd have done just what he said he'd do
[35:54] he'd pray for him he'd pray now will you
[35:57] remember the remember the uh the old man
[36:00] that done he was some kind of an owner
[36:02] of a business and he he poisoned one of
[36:05] his dogs
