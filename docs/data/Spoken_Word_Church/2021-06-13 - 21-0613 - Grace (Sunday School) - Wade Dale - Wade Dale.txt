========================================

good morning god bless you in the name of the lord we're going to today we're going to talk about grace i told you we're going to pick a pick a topic so this has been you know we were on prayer and now we're going to talk for a few minutes on grace um and i want to um just pick a couple of items if you pull up the the first meaning because listen there's grace graceful you can do something with grace and not even be godly a woman can walk down an aisle gracefully uh uh um someone can hit a baseball gracefully so there's there's different types of grace then there's disgrace then we've we all are familiar with the term greasy grace the brother brown brains the greasy grace we're not going to talk about greasy grace yet but we got to bring it in but we're going to talk about grace now the word grace is uh even from the hebrew lexicon there's one up above that i think in there brothers should be said the strong's number 25 80. there we go and it is favor charm favor grace elegance favor and acceptance so we're looking at favor finding favor with god and now like i said before don't think about disgrace and greasy grace let's think about grace just for a minute see that word at the bottom it says acceptance now let's go to the uh definition of grace in the webster's dictionary and we see brother branham tells us it is unmerited divine assistance so when you put that divine in there that has to be from god amen and it's not disgrace it's not gracefully walking it's not it's grace it's unmerited favor you didn't do anything to get this now this fits really good into the plan of redemption that we're preaching on the eternal plan of redemption because without this unmerited divine assistance you and i are dead because we're born in sin shape and iniquity we come to the world speaking lies doomed the prophet said and on our way to hell but look unmerited divine assistance given to humans now grace is given to human beings for their regeneration our sanctification think about that regeneration every one of us paul says follow me in the regeneration or the regening or the new birth there's a lot of people that are given grace but they're not given this kind of grace because only children of god are given divine grace amen because what happens if you don't have the new birth you're not a child of god it says this is a virtue coming from god so look like i said many times before man never developed grace it had to be developed by god right because you and i are not gracious people to a degree we're always pointing fingers it's always this one's fault it's always that one's fault but divine grace comes from god it's a virtue coming from god he knew we would need it and we need this right here very much divine assistance amen so as we go up the statue of a perfect man we need that divine assistance even after the new birth to get us to where we're going and look at this last one approval without grace we're not approved without grace we're sinners and we are sinners but saved by grace all right everybody with me on that and i want you to look we're going to look at a couple of of uh examples that are that are wonderful in the bible let's go to genesis 6 verse 8 it says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord there's only one man out of billions of people that found grace in the eyes of the lord in other words he found acceptance he failed now listen there's one thing it if we say it's unmerited divine assistance given to humans now you must accept that if it's in your regeneration if it's in your new birth or your sanctification you've got to accept it first you've got to accept grace if you don't accept grace then it's not going to do you any good because if you don't accept grace and i was reading in job if you'll read job if you read critical the critical side of job he's a pretty self-righteous guy i didn't do this i didn't do that i didn't do this i didn't do that and then the other three they're accusing him of all kind of things and then thank god elihu showed up and just kind of told them all to shut up he said stand up job we're going to talk about this thing and he presented grace to job i've come instead of god in other words he would we know that was christ and then god met him in a whirlwind and said job stand up i'm going to show you some grace because in the position that job was in he didn't look like he got a lot of grace family was gone he was probably he was a very wealthy man all of his richards are gone and he ended up sitting on the heap of ashes of his uh probably his mansion that he was living in he was sitting on the on the ash heap and then remember satan comes to god and says now i'll really make him deny you if you'll let me touch his body because remember god told him at first he said you can touch all of his possession but don't touch his body then he's come back to him he said okay you can touch his body but you can't take his life so here is uh job scraping boils off of his skin and he doesn't look like he's got a lot of grace but now watch what happens in the analogy of job like we're going to see in the analogy of boaz and ruth that we see that there was a place and i'm sure noah the same way nor found grace in the eyes of the lord look he he had to do something to get god's attention same way with god saying hey have you considered my servant job satan said well you got a hedge around him i'll make him curse you i'll make you just take that hedge away but now watch as you get to the very end of job what happened to job the grace of god comes on the scene gives him seven more children gives him double his cattle in other words if he was a billionaire he became a multi-billionaire but he had to go through the process so you and i and everything that we go through in our life we have to go through a process to me grace is a process sure it's unmerited favor but you know what it has to do with you on one end asking god to do something for you you say no that's unmerited favor god just dumps it be careful be careful that makes you self-righteous and we don't have any self-righteousness now we we are righteous because god see we're righteous because of the grace that god gave us right grace is unmerited divine assistance given to humans so it's not given to anybody else a tree doesn't need grace you and i are the only ones that need grace amen or the approval of god so in genesis 6 8 noah found approval in the eyes of the lord there was no one worthy why because he saw job i mean he saw noah he saw job david talk about grace he was the apple of god's eye and i'm reading in psalms now and you see that god loved david but he didn't love david with filial love he loved him with agape love and agape love is what grace comes from grace comes from the agape love that that david i know the integrity of your heart i know what you really want to do and that's the same thing with me and you he won't he god knows what we really want when we ask him he knows that we might want to ask a miss he knows that we might want to ask for something that's not good but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord in other words noah to me noah was praying this whole scene of noah is that he's praying to god that god you're gonna have to do something with this with this world because it's gone to pot it's it's getting worse and more evil every day so noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and it didn't change you know like i said before prayer changes things but he knew what noah that noah would be the one that would ask for grace that would ask for mercy that would ask for the approval of god and so there noah preached 120 years under grace he was trying to give grace to the billions of people that was on the earth during the time of the before the flood and that's exactly what you and i when we preach the message of the hour when we preach christ that is grace being extended to me and you because we're the only ones that need it and grace listen grace is not for the future grace is for what you've done but now to god he's covered us through eternal redemption knowing that we would need grace and the other side like i said man didn't develop grace noah didn't find grace in the eyes of the republicans and and magistrates during no he found grace in the eyes of the lord brother brown said he was a quack they didn't you know he was preaching 120 years it's going to rain and they're looking at him going staying a cloud in the sky but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and then noah found grace in the eyes of the lord to continue on to build an ark because listen i believe god extends grace to everybody remember it's unmerited but it's whether you accept it but remember the pardon the pardon is not because what is a pardon grace a pardon is grace there was grace extended to that guy that killed the person and all that the part that brother brown talks about the story about the abraham lincoln signing the pardon and he said all this is no good that was his grace that was his approval he was going to be that whole part of him being a murderer was going to be done away with but he didn't accept it same way with me and you if we don't accept grace but now remember it can't be greasy grace or disgrace it's got to be amazing grace but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord so let's go to exodus 33 verse 13. now this is a man named moses and this man named moses wanted to see god he wanted to see this man he'd been talking to for all these years because here we're at exodus 33 they're into the wilderness journey and said now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight in other words if i have found favor or approval and that's the way i want you to think about it today if you have done it's like brother brown says and i'll bring the quote later on he says when you've done all you can do stand right when you've done everything you can do stand right there because you know what grace is not that you're better than somebody else grace is not that you're worse than somebody else grace is unmerited favor but god knows in your heart what you want for a situation because this is what moses wanted for this situation he said lord if i found grace in your sight show me now thy way that i may know thee that i might find grace in thy sight or favor or acceptance and consider that this nation is thy people and the lord said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest but moses wasn't satisfied with that he just didn't want the presence listen to verse 15 and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence that's pretty bold but you know what he's doing he's taking god at his word because god said i'll take these people out by a mighty hand and i'll put them in the promised land that's what you and i got to believe for everything even all the way up to the resurrection and the rapture you've got to believe that god's already said it and then that's the place that we're going to go to amen and then what you'll find favor in the eyes of the lord to me this whole we look at grace different ways but just in a nutshell keep this in your mind in a nutshell to me grace is adoption because we found full favor and adoption we found full favor that where god knows that if you have something in your heart to ask for it it's going to be for the well-being of the people the bride of jesus christ same way with what's what's adoption being able to speak and god being able to react well now that's exactly what moses is doing moses said god if i've found favor in other words if i've done everything that i've been told to do if i found grace in your sight i want to see who you are for within shall it be known verse 16 hear that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us question mark so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth look at verse 17 and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken now there's adoption will do what you spoke because you've met the requirements of the day you've met the acceptance of the hour that we're living in that's what we've been speaking on on eternal redemption it has been on adoption it has been on coming to speaking terms and that god can honor what you say and it's really god speaking it but you and i are going to have to be the vessel that it goes through same way with moses so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that upon the face of the earth and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace or acceptance in my sight and i know thee by name now listen he knew moses before the foundation of the world it wasn't that he just realized well this is moses no he knew moses but what did moses do moses had moses had come into a position that his name implied everybody talks about new name and all these different things you know you become a christian when you become a christian that puts you in a new order that puts you in a new family that puts you in a new way of thinking amen because you find grace in the eyes of the lord and i know thee by name and he said i beseech thee show me thy glory and then we know that what did god do god walked by and showed him the back part of of his theophany and showed that it was a man all right so here we're talking about grace we're also talking about position so let's go to ruth two verse eight because i don't want grace just to be well it's unmerited favor and then throw it out there there's a lot to do with grace god thought enough he said it 160 something times in the scripture and brother branham he said my whole makeup is what grace we'll bring those quotes later on but listen to this ruth two verse eight then boaz said unto ruth hearst thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens now listen he did not know ruth personally at this time but watch this let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee thank god touched you with a denominational idea or touched you with some wrong that's what god's doing remember this is the bride in christ this is the total example of the bride in christ everybody got that and when there are a thirst now look this is the things now listen this message and this bible is not do's and don'ts but it does have a lot to do with what you do and a lot to do what you don't okay everybody got that then look but he tells her what to do in verse 9. all right don't go in another field i'll give you everything you need right here in other words i'll give you the word of god you need and drink of that which the young men have drawn verse 10 then she fell on her face and bound herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes you ever asked the lord that yeah you have you should have he said lord why me well there's a purpose behind all that why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou should take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger remember they never met but watch christ watch boaz boaz had done his homework he didn't she didn't just happen up on boaz and then he just said well i think you're a pretty girl and no he did some checking up on her right right in other words he was watching her before she knew he was watching her amen and boaz answered and said unto her it has fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband now hold on a minute the husband died in moab moab the husband had died way out there in the world yet he somehow boaz had some spies that could what has watched her the whole time wow thank god for that thank god we had a boaz to do the same thing and how thou has left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and our coming to a people which thou knewest not heretofore in other words you come into a christian realm but now watch this the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust the lord recompensed thy work because she didn't raise up and say no i don't think i want to glean here i think i want to go in somewhere else no i really don't want the water that you give me i think i'll get my own i don't want to do this and i don't want to do that no that ruth the bride should not have that attitude our attitude is is what the lord gives us that's what we should take be happy in what the lord's give us right and then what's he gonna do then you take him at his word and then he has to fulfill his word by doing what boaz says look just stay in my field you ain't got nothing to this whole story is that a strange woman comes into the field and boaz already knows who she is and he gives her grace she says how do i find grace in thine eyes that you should take knowledge of me saying i'm a stranger he said the lord recompensed thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings musicians come thou art come to what see grace works on trust and that's what we go back to adoption works on trust if he can't trust you with going forward he's not going to give it to you because he's not going to give something out there and then it returned void he said everything he had he would give and it would never return void it would accomplish and that's what boaz was saying ruth stay right here do the things you're supposed to do stay in the bible stay in the message of the hour and i christ will look over you and make sure that everything's okay you have found grace in my eyes in other words acceptance or favor and that's what you and i want to do now we want to find favor in the eyes of god so our prayer life our reading our bible the different things that we do but remember it can never be greasy grace right if it's greasy grace that's sin and that's actually iniquity that's knowing to do better and you don't do it or not doing it if you know you're supposed to amen but ruth did exactly what boaz suggested and he said well i've done seeing you i've seen you for for years i've been watching over you for years and you found grace in my eyes that's my question it will be the next couple of services have you found grace in the eyes of the lord amen musicians go ahead and play
