[14:58] [Music]
[15:02] amen I bless you like to go right into
[15:06] the word weather back to second Timothy
[15:08] the third chapter just for a quick
[15:11] review you know one of the great things
[15:17] that I look forward to when I come here
[15:19] to visit is fellowship ain't with you
[15:23] Saints but one of the greatest treasures
[15:25] in my life is to be able to spend time
[15:27] quiet time with brother Sam just sitting
[15:30] around in the morning having a cup of
[15:32] coffee and just talking about the word
[15:34] and I just want to be like a magnet when
[15:38] I when I meet somebody who's been around
[15:40] for a lot longer than I have been I'm
[15:43] talking about in the message I used to
[15:45] have a saying if that man sneeze I want
[15:48] to get a handkerchief and catch it and
[15:50] find out find out what's in there and
[15:52] brother Sam is a he's a he's a fountain
[15:56] of wisdom and balance - that's that's
[16:00] the thing I like about brother Sam and
[16:02] brother brother Branham says some people
[16:04] go wild on this side and wild on that
[16:06] side but it's that warm sane gospel that
[16:09] comes right down the middle of the
[16:11] highway and I appreciate that brother
[16:13] Sam amen
[16:14] let's bow our heads just for a moment
[16:16] before we read father we know that you
[16:21] have given us a great privilege of
[16:23] living in the closing moments of time a
[16:26] prophet of God said that when he was
[16:29] here it was three minutes to midnight
[16:30] and I wonder how many seconds to
[16:33] midnight it may be right now Lord we
[16:35] know that time is short we know that you
[16:38] promised to do a quick short work in the
[16:40] end time and when the bride fully
[16:43] realizes who she is and comes to
[16:45] maturity Lord no we're going home so
[16:48] Lord if there's some here that need to
[16:50] be a part of that quick short work the
[16:53] 11th hour workers that need to come in
[16:55] and with the promises they're going to
[16:58] receive the same same reward as those
[17:00] who've labored for a long time I pray
[17:03] Lord that you would quicken their hearts
[17:04] Lord and give them a sense of urgency we
[17:07] ask bless now the word bless the hearts
[17:10] of your people and help me to the
[17:12] get myself out of the way father we ask
[17:15] all these blessings we ask him
[17:17] confidently and your precious name our
[17:20] Lord Jesus Christ amen a second Timothy
[17:25] chapter 3 verse 1 this know also that in
[17:29] the last days perilous times shall come
[17:32] I think every believer should I mean
[17:35] just about anybody in the world could
[17:36] say amen to that
[17:38] perilous that word perilous means
[17:40] dangerous times shall come for men shall
[17:45] be lovers of their own selves covetous
[17:47] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[17:49] to parents unthankful unholy without
[17:53] natural affection trucebreakers false
[17:55] accusers incontinent that word
[17:58] incontinent it means no self-control no
[18:03] self-control fierce despisers of those
[18:07] that are good traitors heady highminded
[18:09] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[18:12] god having a form of godliness we can
[18:16] see that my youth was raised in a
[18:19] Catholic Church people having a form of
[18:22] godliness but denying the power thereof
[18:26] from such turn away for this sort are
[18:28] they which creep into houses and lead
[18:31] captive silly women laden with sins led
[18:34] away with divers lusts ever learning
[18:37] ever learning Baptist Methodist Lutheran
[18:42] Catholic Assembly of God PTL UPC on and
[18:46] on and on and on Buddhist Hindu Muslim
[18:49] ever learning but never able to come to
[18:53] the knowledge of the truth Amen god
[18:56] bless you and you can have your seats I
[19:00] want to to share with you a thought that
[19:07] brother Branham shared in that message
[19:10] the invasion of the United States and I
[19:14] think it could be a great lesson surely
[19:17] it was a lesson to me when I first read
[19:19] it because you know so many people that
[19:22] when I first came in the message they
[19:24] were trying to some of them
[19:26] make brother branham more than he was
[19:28] they were trying to make him Jesus
[19:30] Christ and I heard about people being
[19:32] baptized in his name and you know and I
[19:35] went to India and I heard these Christ
[19:36] branding people and they they believed
[19:38] that brother branham's face was in the
[19:40] man in the moon now his brother
[19:41] Brennan's faith and so there was so much
[19:43] wild things going on and brother Branham
[19:46] said in that message the invasion of the
[19:48] United States and this is his closing
[19:50] prayer and like I said brother Branham
[19:53] was the most transparent prophet that
[19:56] there ever was and like all the other
[19:59] ones we just saw little tiny cliffnotes
[20:01] never go into great detail of their home
[20:05] life domestic life financial life all
[20:08] the struggles they went through but
[20:09] brother Branham lived out in the open
[20:12] and any one of those prophets if they if
[20:15] there were social media and their day he
[20:17] you can imagine how they would have
[20:19] blasted them the same way they try to
[20:21] blast the people who are following this
[20:24] message in this day and the reason
[20:26] they're blasting it so hard is because
[20:28] it's the truth and it's the devil's just
[20:30] the devil's job is to try to thwart
[20:33] those who are following truth he hates
[20:35] truth and I want to be a truth broker I
[20:39] want to be a reality broker I want to
[20:42] deal with truth in large doses and strip
[20:44] away all the fluff and all the veneer
[20:46] and get down like brother Branham said
[20:49] to that bare-knuckle truth that's what
[20:51] the bride wants and that's the thing
[20:53] that breaks the fetters that are on
[20:56] people you know sometimes it is so
[20:58] simple it to be set free but the Satan
[21:02] makes you think is going to be so hard
[21:03] to be set free now I've watched people
[21:06] you know who have back slid who have
[21:08] walked away and maybe gone a year two
[21:11] years but when they come back instead of
[21:13] people said well you know we'll see if
[21:15] he's know we ought to be like that like
[21:18] the father of the the prodigal son we
[21:21] ought to be said welcome them just
[21:23] thanking God that he brought them back
[21:25] and Satan tries to bunt no there's no
[21:28] way you can go back and people won't
[21:30] accept you and they'll be looking at you
[21:32] and they'll be remembered no they're
[21:34] gonna if there's a roof they're the only
[21:36] ones you should care about they're gonna
[21:38] welcome you with open
[21:39] arms and so brother branham is saying
[21:42] father while the great darkness is on
[21:45] the battle and the devil invading the
[21:47] countries and invading the pulpits
[21:49] invading the churches invading the
[21:52] people invading the businesses invading
[21:54] the cities and the schools and the homes
[21:56] oh god help us to stand remember now
[21:59] this is 1954 pull the sword quickly and
[22:04] fight for God as Moses and the Levites
[22:07] did down there when sin was in the camp
[22:10] help us Lord and here's what I want to
[22:13] really you know focus on he says forgive
[22:16] us now and bless us and keep us humble
[22:18] break us up Lord Oh God you said he that
[22:22] goeth forth sewing in tears will
[22:24] doubtless return again rejoicing
[22:27] bringing with him sheaves Oh God break
[22:30] us to pieces mold us a new Lord were
[22:34] getting too much out of the way and then
[22:38] he says I am myself Lord I'm getting to
[22:43] a place where I'm thinking about how
[22:45] many will attend the meeting Oh God
[22:48] I want you to come Lord to break me up
[22:52] mold me over don't let me never get
[22:55] those things on my mind keep them from
[22:58] me so here's brother 1954 not brother
[23:03] Branham at that time he was in his forty
[23:05] you know he was not just in here here's
[23:08] a prophet of God and he's so transparent
[23:10] he said here I find myself wondering how
[23:12] many people are gonna come to the
[23:14] meeting he said take that away from me
[23:16] God don't ever let me start thinking
[23:18] about those things and it's like when
[23:21] when brother Branham was saw the works
[23:23] are going on and oru and and and all
[23:26] those people and the devil come and
[23:28] tried to tell him see God can't trust
[23:30] you with all those things that all
[23:32] Roberts and Billy Graham has got the
[23:35] devil tried to put that on him but God
[23:37] came on the scene he said what is that
[23:39] to thee thou hast me they didn't have
[23:44] him they had the buildings they had the
[23:46] money they had the finances they could
[23:49] go where they want to go dress how they
[23:50] want it went first-class air
[23:53] everywhere but brother Brandon went
[23:55] first-class in the supernatural realm
[23:57] because that angel of God travel with
[24:00] him everywhere that he went
[24:02] I know people I know people that are not
[24:05] serving the Lord they were not in the
[24:07] message but they had exposure to brother
[24:09] Branham well I was in Rock Hill South
[24:11] Carolina right after I graduated from
[24:13] Bible school I was in Assembly of God
[24:15] working as a as associate pastor and and
[24:18] then I got the revelation of one God
[24:21] baptism in jesus name in UPC so I tried
[24:24] to come back and tell some of my real
[24:26] close friends about what I was seeing in
[24:28] the word ID so now keep it to yourself
[24:30] and I'll tell you what before long it
[24:32] went to the pastor and I got the left
[24:34] foot of fellowship right out of the best
[24:37] thing that ever happened to me because
[24:40] after that happened to me right after
[24:42] that I met brother Arne go down to the
[24:44] Full Gospel business convention in
[24:46] Orlando so now I'm sin studying the
[24:50] message but there was one sister back in
[24:52] in South Carolina and she was you know
[24:55] she never cut her hair she was about 75
[24:57] years old and she was going into the
[25:00] nursing home she's 75 years old she's
[25:02] going in there she loved to sing she go
[25:04] in there and she's sing to all the
[25:05] patients a lot of them younger than her
[25:07] so I when I said that I said sister your
[25:10] eyes I've been I've been going through a
[25:12] real learning experience that have you
[25:15] ever heard about name of but my and I'm
[25:18] just kind of stumped yeah you ever heard
[25:20] of a man and I'm almost afraid to say
[25:22] but a William Branham she said William
[25:26] Branham says I was there in Houston in
[25:29] 1950 and she tells she relates the whole
[25:32] story and I didn't know anything about
[25:34] it and she's telling me Reverend best
[25:36] was there and FF Bosworth was there and
[25:39] she and and I'm just sitting there you
[25:40] know blown away the first person I ever
[25:43] met who had experienced personal
[25:46] experience with brother Branham and and
[25:48] she and I was in Lake Charles Louisiana
[25:50] it was the first time I ever heard a
[25:53] pastor and he begged the people not to
[25:55] come to church I said why he said
[25:59] because he knew all the sick people
[26:00] needed to get in the church he was
[26:02] telling the regular people don't come to
[26:04] church let the sick people
[26:06] and she said the people broke the
[26:09] windows in the side of the church
[26:11] building to get into the building that's
[26:13] how desperate they were and so and she
[26:16] said she said to just you you didn't
[26:19] have to wonder when he was there he said
[26:21] you knew when he came in the building
[26:24] just when he came in the building were
[26:27] before the people could even see him
[26:29] there was a presence that came with him
[26:31] when he was the angel of the Lord and
[26:34] the angel of the Lord I believe he's got
[26:37] a glory meter and he can turn that glory
[26:40] meter up as high as he wants to and
[26:42] brother Branham still when that and 19
[26:44] Falls like in a church service that's
[26:46] the angels walking or walking up and
[26:48] down around the aisles and so we have
[26:51] that you know we have got to we've got
[26:53] to get desensitized to this natural
[26:56] world and get sensitized to the
[26:58] supernatural world God has given us
[27:02] supernatural intelligence and and
[27:05] supernatural intelligence is a decoding
[27:08] of the mysteries that are hitting from
[27:11] the wise and the prudent and revealed
[27:13] the babes such as would believe and it's
[27:16] not anything that would that we did we
[27:19] were born with this seed inside of us we
[27:22] were predestinated before the foundation
[27:25] of the world to believe this word and
[27:28] like I said this word it's the only
[27:30] thing in the world that sounds like it's
[27:32] too good to be true and yet we cannot
[27:35] even begin to imagine what glory waits
[27:39] for those who love Him and call for his
[27:41] purpose on the other side and so as a
[27:45] supernatural see gene of God I want to
[27:49] share with you one more thought or
[27:53] actually two more that one of them is
[27:54] real short you know how brother Branham
[27:57] went when the message first started to
[28:00] be recorded the first message is faith
[28:03] is the substance as 1947 April the 12th
[28:10] and what struck me I mean I hope brother
[28:13] Branham said read between the line
[28:15] because the great mysteries you know
[28:17] they lie between the lines well I read
[28:20] the FIR
[28:20] line the first line of any message that
[28:24] was ever recorded and put into print
[28:27] brother Branham says we're getting some
[28:30] new gadgets for recording very for seven
[28:34] words the voice of the seventh angel
[28:37] were getting some new gadgets for
[28:40] recording I thought that was marvelous
[28:42] you know now that might not mean a lot
[28:44] to a lot of people but to me that's like
[28:46] an exclamation point the the seventh
[28:49] angel the one who was going to reveal
[28:52] all the mysteries he was on the scene
[28:54] and they got some gadget I believe those
[28:56] gadgets were just for recording this
[28:59] message and the way that technology has
[29:02] gone one way that the Internet is the
[29:06] modern tree of the knowledge of good and
[29:08] evil and a lot of evil on it but also
[29:12] this message is being used that take
[29:15] this gospel and spread it all around the
[29:18] world one brother that I met this
[29:20] brother he had 40 translations and he
[29:24] wanted to get them printed and a design
[29:27] translation is hard work difficult work
[29:30] at 40 of them and he wanted those that
[29:33] his work he did it because he loved his
[29:36] people and he wanted to get it into
[29:38] their language and he was told well
[29:40] maybe we can print one maybe at the most
[29:43] to this year now could you imagine how
[29:46] disheartening that would have been for a
[29:49] man to put his blood sweat and tears and
[29:51] time and effort and labor and a put all
[29:54] that into him and they told maybe we can
[29:56] print one or two but now the translators
[29:59] they can work at a feverish pace and as
[30:02] soon as that messages is finished it can
[30:05] be electronically translated and beyond
[30:07] the hub the same day and they can email
[30:10] all the people in that language they can
[30:12] say a new treasure is now available to
[30:16] you brother Branham said don't let this
[30:18] message become common to us don't let
[30:21] the fact that you have 1,100
[30:23] supernatural nuggets
[30:25] master brother branham never preached
[30:27] the message to me that was not a
[30:29] masterpiece 1100 plus masterpieces that
[30:33] are
[30:34] available to us but you know it becomes
[30:36] common it was like the manner you know
[30:38] the manner when it first came that was
[30:40] with the children wild manna Wow go out
[30:43] there just pick it up eat it
[30:44] Wow the clothes never wore out shoes
[30:47] never wore out nobody was wonderful I
[30:49] wonder how long it took them as well
[30:52] gotta get up gotta go out and get the
[30:55] man you know and it became common to
[30:57] them and then the water you know I think
[31:00] about the people talk about that water
[31:01] that came out they have a little picture
[31:04] of a little rock they have a little a
[31:06] little dribble like coming out of the
[31:08] hey that that was that rock that had had
[31:11] to give two million adults plus the
[31:14] children plus the animal it had the it
[31:16] had to give them all drink every day and
[31:20] they didn't have to have a u-haul to
[31:22] haul that thing around it travel with
[31:25] him talk about him supernatural you can
[31:29] you imagine being well here comes the
[31:32] rock maybe the rock wanted to move ahead
[31:35] you know that make ways but the rock go
[31:37] through and then every night pillar a
[31:40] fire yeah there is right up there pillar
[31:42] of cloud 808 pillar but yeah and I mean
[31:46] and how how how long did it take for
[31:49] them well that's just the way it is I
[31:52] went to Israel visited the friend of
[31:54] mine it was in the business for he told
[31:56] me if you ever get to Israel please come
[31:59] and look me up he was going back to get
[32:01] married his family they wanted the raise
[32:03] their children Israel finally went there
[32:05] went to his kibbutz and he brought me to
[32:08] Mount Carmel and he took me the back
[32:10] road where the tourists can't go because
[32:12] he was in the Special Forces so he had
[32:14] the badge so I went there and I mean you
[32:17] know just to be there and the inner
[32:19] sanctum of where Elijah called down fire
[32:22] upon those prophets and I'm saying Steve
[32:24] I was in this amazing that you can be
[32:27] here right in the middle of where so
[32:28] much supernatural took place he said
[32:31] well it's just our history book that's
[32:34] the way a Jew just our history book they
[32:37] don't think about the super they don't
[32:39] think about the magnificence of how God
[32:42] led them and delivered them and fought
[32:44] their battles they don't think about
[32:45] that
[32:47] it's it doesn't ring in their brain and
[32:50] as you go around and some people you
[32:52] know brother Sam's come to me the
[32:54] Philippines who went to Brazil and
[32:55] brother ways now going to Philippine and
[32:57] oh they been to Jamaican the Caribbean
[32:59] when you go to another culture it takes
[33:03] some time to figure out that those
[33:06] brains they are wired differently than
[33:09] our brain a French brain a German brain
[33:12] an Italian brain the things that are
[33:15] important to them you know maybe we
[33:17] don't think about them maybe we don't
[33:19] know then words I found out in the
[33:21] Philippines you know I used to use a
[33:24] word a brother branham you he brother
[33:26] Bram used the word a bum well in the
[33:29] Philip I said a bomb in him and the
[33:31] whole congregation a bum is a dirty word
[33:34] over in the Philippines and I'm just
[33:36] quoting what a prophet said but in their
[33:38] language it was a watch out for that
[33:40] brother we don't ever say bum when you
[33:42] good and so their minds are wired
[33:47] differently and the brain of a believer
[33:51] is wired so much differently than a
[33:55] unbeliever even you know even somebody
[33:58] who's a good denominational person lives
[34:02] the work walks in as much light as
[34:04] possible their mind is wired so
[34:07] differently so God has come upon the
[34:11] scene and God has given us that
[34:13] supernatural intelligence super natural
[34:17] intelligence and so so brother Branham
[34:20] said in God perfecting his church he
[34:22] says alright I trust that God will grant
[34:24] you my friend
[34:25] maybe not the courage to come I'm not a
[34:27] persuader I like how he said that I'm
[34:30] not a persuader let God do this I've
[34:33] seen hey listen I have seen so many
[34:36] pulls you know pulls from money polls
[34:38] for people who walk down the altar polls
[34:41] for people a speaking I've seen them all
[34:43] I was telling brother Sam brother
[34:45] Branham said there's three kind of
[34:47] believers believers unbelievers and make
[34:50] believers and the three kind of
[34:52] scheppers a feeder of the sheep and a
[34:55] beater of the sheep and a bleeder of the
[34:57] Sheep and I seen a lot of beaters and I
[34:59] seen a lot of bleeder
[35:01] but I'm so thankful for feeders and I'm
[35:03] so thankful that God fed me a
[35:05] supernatural diet puts real muscles on
[35:09] speak not them for the physical I'm
[35:12] talking about spiritual muscles and
[35:14] brother Brad said it put some hair on
[35:15] your chest I don't know how a sister
[35:18] feels about that but you know that's
[35:20] what brother Branham said but you know
[35:23] what he was talking about so he said now
[35:26] he said he am NOT a persuader see the
[35:28] only thing I can do if the Holy Spirit
[35:30] can get you to move my efforts are too
[35:32] poor to do it see what the father has
[35:34] struck at your heart and no man just
[35:36] think what if God wouldn't call though
[35:39] what if God had not rung your belt what
[35:43] if God had not pre-programmed you he
[35:47] said there is people in this world that
[35:50] will never receive the call that'll
[35:54] never come
[35:56] many said Jude now this is what Jude
[35:58] said in the Bible these men of old was
[36:02] foreordained to this condemnation could
[36:08] you imagine if God raised you up to be
[36:10] Pharaoh or God raised you up to be Judas
[36:14] I mean that was that was foreordained
[36:17] God knew that would happen God wants
[36:20] everybody to be saved but because of
[36:22] foreknowledge and predestination
[36:25] he knows who will receive the call and
[36:27] who won't receive the call look at this
[36:30] look at the the rich young ruler now now
[36:35] only brother only a prophet could bring
[36:37] that out the three stages of the rich
[36:40] young ruler you might be rich young and
[36:45] a ruler my talk about position talk
[36:49] about opportunity freedom do anything he
[36:52] wants to but he had the greatest
[36:55] privilege of his life was coming face to
[36:58] face with the Lord Jesus Christ that was
[37:02] his greatest treasure that he had the
[37:05] greatest opportunity that he had and
[37:07] then he had wisdom enough to ask the
[37:11] right question what must I do
[37:14] to inherit eternal life that's the right
[37:18] question that when I started mr. Expo
[37:21] that's the first thing I asked people
[37:22] where do you intend to spend eternity
[37:26] just kind of just like a little a little
[37:29] filler just to you know fertilize their
[37:31] brain get them to start thinking and I
[37:33] said what do you think heavens going to
[37:35] be like when you get to heaven how many
[37:38] gods are you gonna see and I said now
[37:41] when I was young here's what I used to
[37:43] think and I'm just is what I used to
[37:46] think that was going to be kind of like
[37:47] a grandfatherly kind of guy sitting on
[37:50] the big throne with a long beard and and
[37:53] Jesus the Sun he was gonna be on the
[37:55] right hand and we're gonna have the bird
[37:57] and the bird was gonna be eternally
[37:59] treading air over there just flapping
[38:01] around and I said that's what I thought
[38:03] I was gonna see when I was a young boy I
[38:05] said now that's surely that's not what
[38:07] you think it gets real quiet because
[38:10] they don't know what they're gonna see
[38:11] all as they know is the Trinity the
[38:14] Father the Son the Holy Ghost and these
[38:17] three are one that bothered me when I
[38:20] was a young boy I used to ask the nuns I
[38:23] can't understand that how can God be 308
[38:27] mystery we won't understand these things
[38:29] till we get on get to heaven no I never
[38:32] asked a priest every time I got a new
[38:35] person that it was a religious figure
[38:36] asked the same question got the same
[38:39] answer nobody could understand it so
[38:42] these people are for ordained to this
[38:44] condemnation and to think that God in
[38:46] His goodness tonight jesus said no man
[38:48] can come to me except my father draws
[38:50] him first and all that come will receive
[38:52] everlasting life and God is good enough
[38:55] to knock at your heart tonight and would
[38:59] you be foul enough to refuse him I don't
[39:05] want you go away it's a dangerous thing
[39:09] see oh this people this is what struck
[39:12] me I mean I will never forget this quote
[39:15] he said there is people in eternity
[39:18] tonight out in hell screaming if we
[39:23] could walk and pull open the gate I
[39:26] could just he said walk
[39:27] / and pull open the gate like this and
[39:30] let you look down in there I never have
[39:35] to make much of an altar call they'd be
[39:39] screaming and climbing over one another
[39:43] for the opportunity now forgive me for
[39:47] being a little bit dramatic but in my
[39:49] mind I picture those people just seeing
[39:53] the first crack of light that they'd
[39:55] seen in a long time and somebody just
[39:58] cracked the lid of hell and he said
[40:00] they'd be screaming and climbing over
[40:04] one another for another opportunity but
[40:09] they have passed beyond the veil and
[40:11] beyond mercy now it's too far they can
[40:14] never be redeemed they're gone forever
[40:18] they will never never never be redeemed
[40:23] they had the same opportunity that you
[40:27] have you wouldn't want to take their
[40:30] place tonight would you so why not take
[40:35] the place at the right hand of God to
[40:37] set with him in heavenly places with the
[40:41] Saints so we can't take this mess
[40:45] there's no way we can overestimate the
[40:48] Wonder and the glory and the majesty of
[40:51] what God has done and what he's revealed
[40:54] think about this you know they had a
[40:56] while ago they had some great big
[40:58] lottery one of the biggest lotteries
[41:00] that they ever had could you imagine if
[41:02] you're you know if you were dumb enough
[41:04] to go and buy a ticket first of all now
[41:07] what one brother said well if you did
[41:09] hit the lottery would you have to tithe
[41:12] on it
[41:14] and who would you pay your tithe to so
[41:17] so think about if you had if you had won
[41:20] the lottery would you well you know won
[41:23] the lottery today yeah I'm in the
[41:26] message you know I'm the bride of Jesus
[41:28] Christ you got eternal life dwelling in
[41:31] me never have to die I might I might
[41:35] just go to sleep but I'll wake up and
[41:37] I'll wake up in glory you know a
[41:38] Christian never died that that's me
[41:41] I'll hit the supernatural lottery praise
[41:43] God
[41:44] Lord again and can't say Amen can't say
[41:50] Amen you know I can understand the young
[41:53] people the young people they might as
[41:55] well you know I don't want that boy that
[41:56] I like I don't want him to think I'm a
[41:58] kook or maybe the guy I don't want that
[42:00] girl to think I'm a I have been a kook
[42:02] ever since I became a Christian I'm a
[42:05] front row I want to be at the spout
[42:08] where the glory comes out I very sick
[42:11] the only time I've ever been not on the
[42:13] front row up in my church we got a whole
[42:16] bunch of young uns they're like 10 12 14
[42:18] years old they want to sit on the front
[42:20] row and they think it's great to come in
[42:22] and get brother Ernie spot Oh
[42:25] so one of them the other he walked in
[42:27] there I walked in there and I saw his
[42:29] Bible and he just they just go when they
[42:31] plant their Bible and they go out in the
[42:33] fellowship hall so I come in there get
[42:35] that Bible and put it behind my back and
[42:37] it's just sat there the young boy come
[42:39] over there looked at his Bible cut down
[42:41] he's looking under the seat and
[42:42] everything you know I just said here's
[42:44] your Bible yeah and their mothers tell
[42:46] me he loves to be on the front row he
[42:50] loves to be down there with you and see
[42:52] there was a sign one time it said make
[42:54] sure that you get the church early or
[42:58] else there won't be any seats left in
[43:00] the back of the church and so here we
[43:10] are living in a world of and sent to ask
[43:13] you a question
[43:14] there there is something in the world
[43:17] it's just a little bit over three pounds
[43:20] and yet it is the Wonder and the
[43:24] amazement and the scorn and the
[43:27] criticism of people all over the world
[43:30] just a little over three pounds and
[43:34] people in every country of the world are
[43:37] talking about it you know what it is
[43:41] Donald Trump's brain
[43:44] that's the brainwaves just a little over
[43:47] three pounds but you think about the
[43:49] life that is in there think about the
[43:51] energy that is in there think about the
[43:53] experience that's in there think about
[43:55] the the courage that's you know all
[43:58] these things now we look at it and I
[44:01] mean I'm not concerned one bit about
[44:03] policy because I was I was in a print
[44:05] shop one time when I was going to Bible
[44:07] School down there in North Carolina I
[44:09] walked up to the counter and I'm waiting
[44:11] I look up there is a big banner white
[44:14] banner with red paint pol I - GICs
[44:19] politics and underneath that it said
[44:22] poly means many and tix means parasite
[44:25] so politics equals many parasites I said
[44:29] that that is good enough for me and then
[44:31] I remember brother Branham said I've
[44:32] never voted one time in my life all
[44:35] right I haven't either you know I felt
[44:37] pretty good about that now brother Brown
[44:39] said now yeah I'm not prep brother
[44:41] friends I'm not proud of it but that's
[44:42] just the way it is he said I voted for
[44:44] Jesus and the devil voted against me so
[44:47] he he was happy with that and you know
[44:49] so so all the stuff that's going on
[44:51] around the world its demons its demons
[44:54] that are coming to their full maturity
[44:56] and they're playing like they're playing
[44:59] they've got a violin and they're playing
[45:01] in the minds of the President and the
[45:03] Vice President and the governors and the
[45:05] mayors and the Senators and the Supreme
[45:07] Court demons friends and we we are the
[45:11] spectators supernatural spectators in
[45:14] the gallery we're getting a preview of
[45:17] what is going to be the great white
[45:19] throne judgment because we are
[45:21] eyewitnesses to the insanity that's
[45:24] going on to the problems in the troubles
[45:27] you know and it's like you know it's
[45:29] like two bulls and a range of putting
[45:31] their heads against each other and you
[45:34] wonder how much good could be could be
[45:37] done if the country had a righteous King
[45:43] brother branham's that's the only kind
[45:46] of government that'll work
[45:47] people say well I want to Republic
[45:49] listen friends it is going to be the
[45:52] religious right that finally is going to
[45:55] put the squeeze on groups law
[45:58] Gus if you don't believe in the Trinity
[46:01] my friends you are a cult
[46:04] we had personal experience we were
[46:07] renting our summer camp from a Bible
[46:09] campground nice campground eight years
[46:13] we were there so one day brother Tom
[46:15] goes there to sign the lease and the man
[46:17] says uh could you give us the mission
[46:20] statement of your church brother Tom
[46:23] civil what do you mean they said well do
[46:27] you believe in the Trinity and brother
[46:29] Tom tried to explain oh we believe you
[46:31] know in father son holy go we believe
[46:33] that that the three but there are
[46:35] different offices that God used and it
[46:37] meant no no no if you don't believe in
[46:39] the Trinity or our bylaws say that if
[46:42] you don't believe in the Trinity that
[46:44] that you're a cult and our bylaws won't
[46:47] allow us to rent our campground to you
[46:49] any longer so for a couple of years we
[46:52] had to scramble around we didn't have
[46:54] facilities very good but we made do you
[46:56] know what happened the campground came
[46:59] up for sale they couldn't afford it
[47:02] anymore and guess who bought it we
[47:05] bought it so they couldn't rent it to
[47:11] his brother dick but they could sell it
[47:13] to us and I believe God might have had a
[47:16] little bit to do with that and so we're
[47:20] looking around and you know do not get
[47:23] involved I mean do not let your emotions
[47:26] get riled up about who says what and
[47:28] this commentator says this and look at
[47:31] this and look look at the deep state
[47:33] look what's going on under don't matter
[47:35] it's demons I am NOT a cheerleader for
[47:39] the devil and his army and his amps I
[47:42] have zero interest I'm an observer but
[47:46] it doesn't bother me one way or the
[47:48] other it's all gonna fall America is
[47:51] gone she's been gone since the late 1950
[47:55] brother Brennan if she doesn't accept
[47:57] Christ this year she's gone and she's
[48:00] gone and right after that what happened
[48:03] brother Brennan said politics is a
[48:05] beauty and a popularity contest though
[48:08] here comes John Kennedy on the sea I
[48:11] mean you brother Sam he knows one
[48:13] day that would have been unthinkable for
[48:15] a Catholic to be a president of the
[48:18] United States and his dad he had the
[48:20] pull strings had to get the Mafia
[48:22] involved get the unions involved had to
[48:25] get Hollywood involved everybody and
[48:27] they stole the election and you know
[48:31] what happened people I just want to give
[48:35] you just a little insight this is
[48:36] something a treasure that you can just
[48:39] how the Catholic Church operates the
[48:43] Vatican in 1960 they had only one
[48:48] country that they considered to be a
[48:50] Christian country in Asia and that would
[48:54] be the Philippines because the
[48:55] Philippines is about seventy to eighty
[48:57] percent Catholic now we know far from a
[49:00] Christian nation but in the Pope's eyes
[49:02] that was a Christian nation and so he
[49:05] wanted to have another country in Asia
[49:08] to be a Christian nation
[49:10] now John Kennedy comes on the scene and
[49:13] so the Pope goes there and all the
[49:15] intelligentsia all of the Jesuits they
[49:18] go down there and they get this man in
[49:20] South Vietnam and they prop him up and
[49:23] they fund him and they get the
[49:25] propaganda and they make him the
[49:27] president of South Vietnam and in the
[49:31] Pope as mr. Kennedy would you mind
[49:33] sending some advisors over there to help
[49:36] them to get their nation established
[49:38] well sure they send over the advisor and
[49:42] war advisor and more advisors and then
[49:46] they assassinate the guy John Kennedy
[49:50] took that very personal and then it was
[49:53] Katie bar the doors it was like a
[49:55] full-fledged invasion over the years
[49:59] it's a book it was written by a man the
[50:04] name of the book is called Vietnam why
[50:06] did we go and he documents the documents
[50:10] and documents a date by date by date by
[50:13] date how we that's how the Vatican goes
[50:17] there and they have their coup d'etat
[50:19] see my mother sister was a nun
[50:22] and and she was the nun for 16 years
[50:25] before she left the convent to this day
[50:28] she's still alive now she's 84 years old
[50:30] to this day never has told didn't tell
[50:33] her mom or dad which would be my
[50:35] grandmother grandfather didn't tell her
[50:37] brothers her sisters nobody in our
[50:40] family's a big fan never told one person
[50:42] why she left the convent when you become
[50:47] a priest or a nun in the Catholic Church
[50:50] you have access to two passports
[50:53] you have your own passport like American
[50:55] passport and you have a Vatican passport
[50:58] and no country will refuse a Vatican
[51:01] passport and so that's how they have
[51:03] been able to go there and go down there
[51:06] and ferment you know odyssia disunity in
[51:09] the countries down in South America and
[51:12] places over in Asia they go there and
[51:14] they stir they stir things up because
[51:17] it's to their the their mode of and
[51:21] objective and intention to have an
[51:23] influence in that country believe me
[51:26] that that that dragon that beast that
[51:28] serpent he has not changed one iota from
[51:32] what he wanted in the garden he want he
[51:35] wanted to be respected he wanted honor
[51:38] he wanted glory and the only he's not a
[51:40] creator he's just a pervert err so he'd
[51:43] if he could go in there and he could
[51:44] pervert it right from the beginning look
[51:47] at how many tens of millions hundreds of
[51:50] millions even into the billions are
[51:53] worshipping him thinking that they are
[51:57] worshipping God Satan does not care how
[52:02] he gets the glory as long as he gets the
[52:06] glue he doesn't care if it's Buddhist
[52:08] glory Hindu glory Muslim glory Catholic
[52:11] lore he doesn't care what kind of glory
[52:14] as long as he can keep them from what
[52:17] you've got and what I have done that's
[52:21] his great desire our mandate is to
[52:24] establish Christ in this church in our
[52:28] life in the lives of our family we're
[52:31] given token we're giving token power to
[52:34] believe and have
[52:35] faith for those and watch them come in
[52:37] God's path that that power that token is
[52:41] so sometimes underestimated and people
[52:44] well you know I just applied the token
[52:46] it's like they got a little magic wand a
[52:48] little token huh I just you know you fly
[52:50] the token brother branham said if your
[52:54] little child was out there playing in
[52:57] the middle of a highway would you say
[52:59] well Johnny
[53:00] they'll come in out of the highway you
[53:03] might get hurt no it would be an
[53:06] emergency it would be a 9-1-1 situation
[53:10] now I'm not talking about going there
[53:12] shaking them but you know what you might
[53:13] do you might sit and sit down and do a
[53:16] long lost art write them a love letter
[53:20] dear son I love you I have always loved
[53:25] you I will always love you but I love
[53:27] your soul and I am concerned about you
[53:30] I'm concerned about your destiny I'm
[53:33] concerned because you have the truth you
[53:36] have the greatest treasure and yet
[53:38] somehow the enemy is keeping you from
[53:40] this treasure it's like the man who's
[53:43] got ten million dollars in the bank but
[53:45] he can't write a check and that's how
[53:47] our family that's how our friends are
[53:49] you know what's what's their bank
[53:52] account their bank account is that you
[53:54] are their friend you are their mother
[53:56] you are their brother you are their
[53:58] sister
[53:58] you are concerned from that you have got
[54:00] supernatural truth you are the only one
[54:03] many people that I meet I know I am the
[54:06] only person that that person may ever
[54:09] come in contact with in their entire
[54:12] life that is the son of God
[54:16] what a responsibility in that word
[54:19] responsibility if you take the word
[54:21] responsibility and break it down its
[54:24] responsibility having the ability to
[54:27] respond
[54:28] do you have responsibility are you able
[54:31] to respond to the great challenge of
[54:33] today now we don't have that power but
[54:36] God's giving us that power it's God in
[54:38] us not going after them in the flesh but
[54:42] going after them in the spirit a phone
[54:45] call you know email specifically on an
[54:48] email but

[55:30] they get a personal letter they will
[55:32] take that letter and they will read it
[55:34] at least three or four times when they

[1:01:57] treasure that has been given to me that
[1:02:00] great white said that the the the rich
[1:02:02] young ruler a great privilege asked the
[1:02:06] right question what must I do to inherit
[1:02:09] eternal life so Jesus just looked at him
[1:02:13] discerned his life he saw well money is
[1:02:16] gonna become the god of the the rich
[1:02:19] young ruler he says well if you want if
[1:02:22] you want to have eternal life here's
[1:02:24] what you got to do go rich young ruler
[1:02:28] sell everything that you have and give
[1:02:34] it to the poor and come follow me
[1:02:39] come and be my disciple the greatest
[1:02:44] invitation of all time we can look back
[1:02:47] and see it was a great invitation for
[1:02:50] the rich young ruler but how about your
[1:02:53] invitation how about when God knocked at
[1:02:56] your door rang your doorbell we know how
[1:03:00] the rich young ruler responded he walked
[1:03:03] away very sad because he had great
[1:03:07] possessions I always say the preaching
[1:03:10] of the gospel is either gonna make you
[1:03:12] mad glad or sad one or the other and for
[1:03:15] him it made him very sad and he walked
[1:03:18] away now we see a by a prophet sighs we
[1:03:21] see him later
[1:03:22] well my barns are filled I'm increased
[1:03:26] with Goods I have need of nothing I'm
[1:03:30] gonna take it easy maybe go to Palm
[1:03:33] Springs or maybe go you know somewhere
[1:03:36] warm on a beach somewhere maybe and
[1:03:39] then the word come said thou fool this
[1:03:44] day thy soul is required of thee and
[1:03:49] then we see his end he's in torment and
[1:03:53] he looks up and he sees a bur
[1:03:56] God allowed him from his place to see
[1:03:59] Abraham now Jesus you know he's seeing
[1:04:03] all this an divisional II that vision is
[1:04:06] normal for he's just looking through the
[1:04:08] tunnel of time while he's talking of
[1:04:10] giving this this lesson and he cries out
[1:04:14] father Abraham now think about this he's
[1:04:20] still trying to maintain his testimony
[1:04:22] he's in hell and he's calling father
[1:04:25] Abraham and he asked him let Lazarus
[1:04:29] come and and and drop a couple of drops
[1:04:32] of water in my top I'm paraphrasing hey
[1:04:35] bruh no no can do hey you had everything
[1:04:39] he had nothing well I used to feed him
[1:04:45] the crumbs from my table sure
[1:04:48] he said beside that there is a great
[1:04:51] gulf fixed he can't come here you can't
[1:04:56] go there so now he says well if that's
[1:05:00] the case here's my plan
[1:05:02] let there be a great evangelistic
[1:05:04] crusade be it be formed and take that
[1:05:07] crusade and go to my brothers and preach
[1:05:11] to them and warn them that they don't
[1:05:14] come to this wicked place where I am
[1:05:19] Abraham said nope they have they have
[1:05:23] the law they have Moses the prophets and
[1:05:26] if one rose from the dead they still
[1:05:32] would not believe now friends this word
[1:05:35] in our day in our lives this word has
[1:05:39] risen it's become a brand new book
[1:05:43] brother Sam would say when those seals
[1:05:45] were open we talked about it yesterday
[1:05:46] brother Brown this whole Bible became a
[1:05:49] brand new book go
[1:05:51] gave us supernatural goggles to be able
[1:05:55] to look at it be able to see brother
[1:05:57] Branham says I'm a typology and any man
[1:06:00] who truly understands the Bible will be
[1:06:03] a typology I can tell you I graduated
[1:06:05] from Bible School I didn't know what a
[1:06:07] type was I didn't know what a shadow was
[1:06:09] they taught us hermeneutics homiletics
[1:06:12] how to how to get a subject how to put a
[1:06:14] title on it how to get an introduction
[1:06:16] how to get point one point two point
[1:06:19] three have a couple illustration and
[1:06:20] then close and then pull that's what
[1:06:25] that's what all theology schools teach
[1:06:27] and so the great white throne judgment
[1:06:32] is waiting for many people and brother
[1:06:36] Branham says that when when when they
[1:06:39] are there what a picture he paints now I
[1:06:43] want to just remind you that the subject
[1:06:45] that I took this morning was invasion
[1:06:49] insanity deliverance so the world has
[1:06:53] been invaded has been invaded for a long
[1:06:56] time but when the seals were open it was
[1:06:59] a super invasion because there was a
[1:07:01] whole bunch more million demons that
[1:07:04] were unleashed these were extra demons
[1:07:07] that were not in the world before and
[1:07:09] their target is you and me that's why we
[1:07:14] have to have the whole armour of God on
[1:07:16] every day you may think well I'm nothing
[1:07:19] I'm well really we are nothing in
[1:07:21] ourselves but with God in you you have a
[1:07:25] treasure in earthen vessels you're
[1:07:28] carrying that seed you're carry eternal
[1:07:31] life got the token walking down the
[1:07:33] street got the token got the token and
[1:07:35] me got eternal life in me and you got to
[1:07:38] talk with one one time there was a
[1:07:40] fellow who talked to himself and they
[1:07:41] said why do you talk to yourself all the
[1:07:43] time he said well he had two reasons
[1:07:46] number one I like to talk to intelligent
[1:07:48] people and number two I like to hear
[1:07:51] what intelligent people have to say and
[1:07:53] so you know what I talked to myself and
[1:07:56] you know what I talk I remind myself of
[1:07:58] the scriptures I remind myself of the
[1:08:01] church age of the seals of the future
[1:08:04] home of
[1:08:05] heavenly bride and bridegroom and I also
[1:08:08] think about the great white throne
[1:08:11] judgment brother Branham says when they
[1:08:13] come there their whole life will flash
[1:08:15] before them in an instant everything
[1:08:20] they ever said everything they ever did
[1:08:24] everything they ever thought and brother
[1:08:28] Branham says you think your thoughts are
[1:08:29] private no he said every motive for
[1:08:34] everything you said or did or thought
[1:08:37] will be flashed people think television
[1:08:41] is a great thing I believe in television
[1:08:44] I believe God sent a prophet to
[1:08:46] television and he told that vision to me
[1:08:49] and it's precious to me and you know
[1:08:52] like like brother Branham was saying in
[1:08:54] that invasion he was saying Lord you
[1:08:56] know humbled me mold me break me and he
[1:08:59] people tried to make him something you
[1:09:01] know I'm your brother don't do that
[1:09:04] you're making the Antichrist so and so
[1:09:07] so here's a prophet of God here he's
[1:09:09] he's laying on his bed well if I'm ever
[1:09:11] gonna do anything for God Betty he's
[1:09:13] millions of souls have been preached the
[1:09:16] gospel untold numbers of healings
[1:09:19] I mean brother Tim Dodds a minister in
[1:09:22] our church he's just want to drop this
[1:09:23] in for you he his mom and dad were both
[1:09:26] healed and brother branham's meetings up
[1:09:27] in northern Canada he said when they are
[1:09:31] in a meeting brother Branham was there
[1:09:32] and to blind people were there and and
[1:09:36] and one was a man one was a woman
[1:09:37] brother Ram prayed for both of them told
[1:09:40] them the goal and belief the man was
[1:09:43] healed the woman was not healed later on
[1:09:47] she wrote a letter the brother branham
[1:09:49] their brother branham you know explained
[1:09:51] the whole situation was in that meeting
[1:09:53] and myself another blind man and he was
[1:09:56] healed and I wasn't healed she said why
[1:09:59] didn't I get my healing she got the
[1:10:01] letter back somebody had to read it to
[1:10:04] her and it was a believer who read it to
[1:10:06] her and a believer who shared the story
[1:10:08] brother Branham wrote back said the
[1:10:10] reason you were not healed is because
[1:10:13] you did not want to give up your blind
[1:10:16] pension and you love the
[1:10:18] tenshun you are getting for being blind
[1:10:22] let that one roll around in your mind
[1:10:25] for a moment
[1:10:26] brother Bram talks about motive
[1:10:29] objective for everything you said
[1:10:31] everything you did everything you ever
[1:10:34] thought we serve awesome God friends
[1:10:37] that got I try to talk to people about
[1:10:39] about predestination and foreigner like
[1:10:42] brother ran said well that that's a bad
[1:10:43] word in some circles I can talk to me I
[1:10:45] said do you believe God knows how many
[1:10:47] hairs are on my headset it yep
[1:10:48] do you believe God will know how many
[1:10:50] hairs I have in my head next week yeah
[1:10:53] how about next month and I just kind of
[1:10:55] I said well I said if God knows all that
[1:10:59] how can he not know what choices I'm
[1:11:01] going to make and where I'm going to be
[1:11:03] next week and where I'm going to be at
[1:11:05] the end of my life and what choices I'm
[1:11:07] going to be and what choices you're
[1:11:08] going to make so I said no your church
[1:11:13] they used to teach you know and a lot of
[1:11:15] them did teach predestined I said they
[1:11:17] used to teach they used to preach
[1:11:19] holiness so let me ask you a question
[1:11:22] did they start wrong or are they
[1:11:24] finishing wrong one of the other see
[1:11:27] sometime sometimes you got to walk
[1:11:29] around and somebody's brain walk around
[1:11:31] fertilize your brain and that's the
[1:11:33] question has to come an answer and you
[1:11:36] know what most of them have no answer oh
[1:11:38] I don't know oh I I just believe my past
[1:11:41] I just believe my church that's the
[1:11:43] defense mechanism sorry they didn't get
[1:11:48] what I got out of the Bible out of the
[1:11:51] word and so here that that that we have
[1:11:55] we've come to a point lots of us we had
[1:11:58] to be like Samson we had to be stripped
[1:12:01] down and then you know sometimes the
[1:12:03] Lord one more time just one more time I
[1:12:08] think about that story brother Wade and
[1:12:10] how those those people they found out
[1:12:13] what his his secret of his strength was
[1:12:15] and they finally cut his hair off and
[1:12:18] they had him out there in the grinding
[1:12:20] wheel and he's just running around just
[1:12:22] grinding and all all the people brother
[1:12:25] Brown said the name of Samson it used to
[1:12:27] make them fish speaking his
[1:12:29] made them tremble here's the guy little
[1:12:32] little guy took the whole gates of the
[1:12:34] city on his shoulders and so they knew
[1:12:36] that now they had him blinded rope tied
[1:12:40] down grinding and they're laughing and
[1:12:43] cheering a little more hair grow back
[1:12:46] you know what happened he grind a little
[1:12:48] bit faster they said hey our economy is
[1:12:51] gonna go up our enemy now he's grinding
[1:12:53] faster more production here
[1:12:55] so he started grinding faster and he
[1:12:57] reached back there if that was me and I
[1:13:00] was one of those Philistine kings that
[1:13:02] guy would have got he would have got his
[1:13:04] head shaved seven times a day there
[1:13:07] would not it would not have been a
[1:13:08] chance a piece of peach fuzz would ever
[1:13:10] grow up on his head but he said Lord
[1:13:13] just one more time and you know there's
[1:13:15] gonna be a lot of Samson's in this world
[1:13:18] they're gonna be at a place where they
[1:13:20] you know they they they ran after other
[1:13:22] things they were warned by God but they
[1:13:24] had to have it he had to have that
[1:13:27] Jezebel I thought what do you think he
[1:13:29] was thinking about when he was grinding
[1:13:30] here
[1:13:31] oh that that Bob heard that Jezebel why
[1:13:34] do I listen to her oh he probably had a
[1:13:36] lot of thoughts going through his mind
[1:13:39] I'm sorry July Longview Jezebel well
[1:13:42] they're probably twin sisters you know
[1:13:44] probably cut yeah same DNA so anyways
[1:13:48] you know so now one more time Lord and
[1:13:51] God used him and in the end of his life
[1:13:54] he was more productive than he ever was
[1:13:56] all through his life and I believe
[1:13:58] there's going to be people on the
[1:14:00] homestretch you're gonna be more fervent
[1:14:03] you're gonna have more of a desire
[1:14:04] you're gonna have more intensity you're
[1:14:06] gonna be more awareness you're gonna be
[1:14:08] super sensitive to the supernatural
[1:14:10] which is where we need to be we were
[1:14:14] trained for this friends it's like you

[1:18:10] gone so far beyond what we would
[1:18:13] considered crazy and yet God has God
[1:18:17] just like Satan went into the ether into
[1:18:20] the garden and deceived Eve God has
[1:18:22] snuck in the Satan's Eden and he has
[1:18:25] come and he snatched his bride in the
[1:18:27] darkest in the most wicked in the most
[1:18:30] vile in the most insane age and insanity
[1:18:33] on steroids God has brought deliverance
[1:18:37] to his bride and so now where are we now
[1:18:42] what what is God revealed to us what do
[1:18:44] we know you know you think about what's
[1:18:48] in your just try to do inventory and
[1:18:52] I've done inventory sometimes in
[1:18:53] business hard work it's tedious work
[1:18:55] sometimes try to do inventory what do
[1:18:59] you know what is God revealed to you you
[1:19:04] are a walking talking supernatural
[1:19:08] encyclopedia walking down the road
[1:19:11] and nobody know you that you just pass
[1:19:14] by people nobody know well there's a a
[1:19:17] son of God there's a daughter of God oh
[1:19:21] well I wish I knew would know yeah they
[1:19:24] don't know brother branham said when
[1:19:27] Jesus was here 1% of the people knew
[1:19:31] Jesus was here he said in our day now
[1:19:34] listen to this this base son you got to
[1:19:36] go back and search your brother sounds
[1:19:38] right here brother branham said in our
[1:19:40] day it will be 1/100 of 1% who will be
[1:19:46] able to receive the message now if that
[1:19:49] doesn't make you the elite of God by the
[1:19:52] grace of God I don't know what does and
[1:19:56] often times I think a lot of times I'm
[1:19:59] flying and I'm traveling and I'm really
[1:20:02] I'm thankful that I am able to travel
[1:20:04] again and you know God has done such a
[1:20:07] miraculous work he has done
[1:20:08] I want the 15 different medical
[1:20:11] practitioner everything from my family
[1:20:13] doctor chiropractic naturopathic
[1:20:16] acupuncture acupressure and everything
[1:20:19] and all I said well what's wrong they
[1:20:22] said well the nerves you got neuropathy
[1:20:23] neuro means nerves and pathway means
[1:20:25] sick it's sick nerves your your nerve
[1:20:27] endings are misfiring and they said we
[1:20:30] hold your feet and and I hold your feet
[1:20:33] in my head your feet are warm but your
[1:20:35] brain is telling your feet are ice-cold
[1:20:37] I woke up felt like I had two ice cubes
[1:20:39] at the end of my feet I walked I felt
[1:20:41] like I was walking on pins and needles
[1:20:42] my feet wouldn't know I couldn't feel I
[1:20:44] was tripping over myself and all the doc
[1:20:47] I was desperate friends
[1:20:48] I was desperate wanted to know of some
[1:20:50] answer wanted to find somebody who could
[1:20:52] give me you know they all said no it's
[1:20:54] impossible
[1:20:55] those nerves can't regenerate I'm sure
[1:20:58] sister Rebeka can tell you probably they
[1:21:00] told the same thing to brother Gary and
[1:21:01] thank God for brother Gary and sister
[1:21:03] Rebecca the brother Gary went to the
[1:21:05] pain clinic and he told me about the
[1:21:06] prescription today and that was the
[1:21:09] thing that gave me a little bit of
[1:21:10] relief and it helped me to have faith
[1:21:12] help me to believe every step along the
[1:21:14] way now God has totally regenerated
[1:21:17] every nerve in my feet except for my big
[1:21:19] toe
[1:21:22] and my big toes are not not healed yet
[1:21:26] and I believe that God just left them
[1:21:27] there for a while to remind me of what
[1:21:29] he's done oh what a great every time I
[1:21:31] have to look down so well I ain't I
[1:21:34] ain't what I'm want them to be
[1:21:36] I ain't what they're gonna be but I'm
[1:21:37] sure glad they ain't what they used to
[1:21:39] be so I think oftentimes what has God
[1:21:44] revealed to us you know I'm just gonna
[1:21:46] be done in just two minutes so just just
[1:21:49] hold on and I thought once I was flying
[1:21:51] in a plane and I said you know what has
[1:21:56] God revealed in the message to me that I
[1:21:59] didn't know before I came to the message
[1:22:01] and so it's like brother Branham had the
[1:22:03] things that God said pick up your pen
[1:22:04] and write so I picked up my pen on the
[1:22:06] plane and I wrote I said if this message
[1:22:09] had not come to me I would not know that
[1:22:12] it had never rained before Noah's day it
[1:22:14] was 120 years built in the ark I
[1:22:16] wouldn't know that I wouldn't know that
[1:22:18] Abraham and Sarah would change back to a
[1:22:20] young man a young I'm reading the
[1:22:22] exactly what I wrote down
[1:22:23] I wouldn't know that King Saul was saved
[1:22:25] I wouldn't know the rich young ruler
[1:22:26] ultimate end was hell
[1:22:28] I wouldn't know the Enoch built the
[1:22:30] pyramids I wouldn't know the truth about
[1:22:31] baptism and Godhead wouldn't know the
[1:22:33] initial evidence was not speaking in
[1:22:35] tongues I wouldn't know the truth about
[1:22:36] the rapture and the changing wouldn't
[1:22:38] know who the two witnesses were wouldn't
[1:22:39] know who the 144,000 wouldn't know who
[1:22:41] the souls under the altar that's the big
[1:22:43] that took me about five minutes then I
[1:22:46] would I wouldn't know the revelation of
[1:22:48] the church age of the seven seals
[1:22:50] I wouldn't know the serpent seed that
[1:22:51] Cain and Abel were twins I wouldn't be
[1:22:53] able to measure the future home of the
[1:22:55] of the heavenly bride and bridegroom
[1:22:56] I wouldn't know the Antichrist the false
[1:22:58] prophet and the beast it was just three
[1:23:00] stages of Satan's rule I wouldn't know
[1:23:02] about the the harlot the number of
[1:23:04] the Beast the name of the Beast the mark
[1:23:05] of the beast the image of the Beast I
[1:23:07] wouldn't know about the seven dimension
[1:23:09] I wouldn't know about adoption
[1:23:10] predestination statue of a perfect man
[1:23:12] marriage and divorce anointed ones at
[1:23:14] the end time Satan's Eden godless evil
[1:23:16] age as a very religious doing God a
[1:23:18] service without a being his will the
[1:23:20] supernatural and the third pull after I
[1:23:22] read that I said that's a lot
[1:23:26] and you know what you know that or if
[1:23:29] you don't know it it's available to you
[1:23:31] to know it to dig it out every one of
[1:23:35] those truths is a treasure remember we
[1:23:38] talked about a mystic a myth but the
[1:23:41] rest is the mystical bride of Jesus
[1:23:43] Christ and a mystic is one who seeks
[1:23:46] after and attains direct intercourse
[1:23:50] with God what's he gonna say to the ones
[1:23:53] that come before him depart from me you
[1:23:55] workers of iniquity I never knew you I
[1:24:00] never became intimate with you you never
[1:24:03] became pregnant with my word it's
[1:24:08] awesome awesome treasure awesome
[1:24:10] privilege that God so now I'm thinking
[1:24:13] well as a result of that what what has
[1:24:15] God made the bride this took a little
[1:24:18] bit of time only take me two minutes but
[1:24:20] as a result of that first of all we
[1:24:22] realize that we truly are new creatures
[1:24:25] in Christ not not a patched up job but a
[1:24:28] brand-new unit we are the happiest
[1:24:31] people on earth where the attributes of
[1:24:33] God thoughts of God offspring of God
[1:24:34] genes of God's sperm of God

[1:24:39] generation we are overcomers of the name
[1:24:41] the number of the mark the image the
[1:24:43] Beast

[1:24:46] the world we are a new species of a
[1:24:48] supernatural divine order we are sons
[1:24:51] and daughters of the king mystics and a
[1:24:53] mystical body the elite of God the super
[1:24:56] church the super race we are unshakable
[1:24:59] indestructible unmovable courageous bold

[1:25:17] believers aliens pilgrims and strangers
[1:25:19] we are the revival we are the prisoners
[1:25:22] of love of Christ the word and the
[1:25:25] message we're the happiest prisoners on
[1:25:27] the face of the earth
[1:25:28] we are super sensitive supernatural we
[1:25:31] are the most contagious people on the
[1:25:32] face of the earth the most spontaneous
[1:25:34] people on the face of the earth we are a
[1:25:37] product of divine supernatural engineer
[1:25:40] a product of spiritual evolution we are
[1:25:43] seated and Krait with Christ in heavenly
[1:25:46] places a part of a divine Lissa a divine
[1:25:49] spiritual supernatural aristocracy other
[1:25:54] why America is so infatuated with the so
[1:25:57] called royal family over there on the
[1:26:00] other side of the imposters
[1:26:03] impersonators on the royal family you're
[1:26:07] the royal family you're part of a divine
[1:26:10] spiritual supernatural aristocracy but
[1:26:13] her brother Bram say when the bride
[1:26:15] fully realizes who she is and comes to
[1:26:19] maturity rapture we're talking brother
[1:26:23] Sam brother Sam see God's waiting on us
[1:26:26] he's waiting on her I hope he's not
[1:26:28] waiting on me I would not want to be the
[1:26:31] one to hold up the progress I hope
[1:26:33] you're not there's gonna be those who
[1:26:36] are left behind friends they're still
[1:26:39] virgin but they're foolish virgins
[1:26:41] brother branham said that maybe the
[1:26:43] people who walked in all the light they
[1:26:45] had or maybe they never had a chance to
[1:26:47] see the message and yet they're true and
[1:26:49] heart and God knows their heart maybe
[1:26:51] they gave a cup of water to the bride
[1:26:53] maybe they were good to the bride that's
[1:26:55] in God that's in God's I can't judge
[1:26:58] anybody only god can judge those people
[1:27:00] but he will righteous judgment and in
[1:27:03] his eyes if somebody did something for
[1:27:06] you that may have been their ticket into
[1:27:08] eternity not as a bride friends we have
[1:27:12] the seed of perfect love just the last
[1:27:14] page now we have the seed of perfect
[1:27:16] faith we have God's supernatural
[1:27:18] strength and stamina in us we have
[1:27:21] received a divine blood transfusion a
[1:27:24] heart transplant a mind transplant a
[1:27:26] life transplant we have the ability to
[1:27:29] prosper and thrive in the realms of the
[1:27:31] supernatural we have a supernatural
[1:27:33] marching order we have a passion to know
[1:27:36] and serve God a magnificent obsession to
[1:27:39] know Christ and we have a supernatural
[1:27:42] Passport let's stand to our feet friends
[1:27:45] I wonder I wonder I had a while ago you
[1:27:52] know I hadn't been traveling for
[1:27:54] while and my passport expired and I had
[1:27:57] to go through the whole process go down
[1:27:59] get my picture taken take it down to the
[1:28:01] post office send away and they send me a
[1:28:03] brand new passport all ready to go
[1:28:06] I wonder how about your passport how
[1:28:10] about your supernatural passport if the
[1:28:14] rapture were to happen maybe after we go
[1:28:18] to the dedication service of the house
[1:28:21] the home have some fun if the rapture
[1:28:23] happened tonight where would you be
[1:28:28] tomorrow hopefully there would be no
[1:28:31] tomorrow for you because you'd be in
[1:28:33] another realm but how many that we rub
[1:28:36] shoulders with how many that are in the
[1:28:39] body of Christ around the world how many
[1:28:41] if the rapture happened today they would
[1:28:45] be in the tribulation and you know what
[1:28:47] they would be they would be just as
[1:28:50] desperate as those people who are in
[1:28:52] Hell crawling and screaming at each
[1:28:55] other just one another chance they want
[1:28:57] another Church of salvation the foolish
[1:28:59] virgins maybe if they knew about this
[1:29:02] message or it heard about the message
[1:29:03] but had you know maybe they were on the
[1:29:06] fence about it and they find out it was
[1:29:08] true they would be grasping if I only
[1:29:11] had one more chance to be part of God's
[1:29:15] supernatural bride don't take it for
[1:29:18] granted friends don't ever let it become
[1:29:21] common let's bow our heads father we
[1:29:28] know that a lot of people they have a
[1:29:31] lot of wise wh-why why and brother
[1:29:36] Branham preached about wise why this why
[1:29:39] that why little Bethlehem why it had to
[1:29:41] be a and the wise in this day they will
[1:29:46] understand all the wise we are wide W is
[1:29:51] e and we understand the wh-why s because
[1:29:54] the prophet has told us why it had to be
[1:29:58] shepherds why little Bethlehem and so
[1:30:02] tonight hopefully we're speaking in a
[1:30:06] language that is going
[1:30:08] to encourage you to cash in on your
[1:30:10] supernatural beneficiary policy the
[1:30:15] divine promises that are left in this
[1:30:17] word
[1:30:18] I trust that you'd be able to write your
[1:30:21] check whatever God has promised in the
[1:30:24] word whether Branham said he's a great
[1:30:26] high priest sitting at the right hand of
[1:30:30] majesty waiting to make good any one of
[1:30:35] the redemptive blessings
[1:30:37] he's waiting brother Branham says he
[1:30:40] can't even go to work on your case
[1:30:43] whether it's salvation healing to liquid
[1:30:46] he can't even go to work on your case
[1:30:49] until we confess it and literally this
[1:30:55] this is really going out on a limb
[1:30:57] friends but we literally buy our faith
[1:31:01] and buy our profession we literally put
[1:31:05] God into motion on our behalf on our
[1:31:10] need like I said that's stretching if
[1:31:12] I'm wrong brother Sam can correct me but
[1:31:15] I believe that to be true God has gone
[1:31:17] to work on my case so many - and he's
[1:31:20] able to go to work on everybody's case
[1:31:24] simultaneously around the world able to
[1:31:27] hear and answer every prayer around the
[1:31:31] world so don't ever think God is too
[1:31:33] busy to hear your prayer or to answer
[1:31:36] your prayer father we thank you for this
[1:31:40] great opportunity
[1:31:41] thank you for brother Sam and for having
[1:31:44] the confidence to have me come and speak
[1:31:46] and I know he does not take that lightly
[1:31:48] and I don't take this privilege lightly
[1:31:51] I pray father that you would take the
[1:31:53] words that were spoken that you would
[1:31:55] anoint them afresh and anew in the
[1:31:57] hearts of your children and let them
[1:31:59] walk out from this building tonight
[1:32:02] saying it was good to have been in the
[1:32:03] house of God God heard me God heard
[1:32:06] maybe maybe God answered a need that I
[1:32:08] did not even know that I had maybe I
[1:32:11] have been a little bit cold and starchy
[1:32:13] and formal maybe I have been lukewarm
[1:32:15] maybe I have not taken advantage of all
[1:32:18] the blessings that this message affords
[1:32:20] me but today
[1:32:21] starting from this time from this time
[1:32:24] on I'm going to be a son of God like
[1:32:27] I've never been before I'm gonna be a
[1:32:29] daughter of God like I've never been
[1:32:31] before I'm gonna be a wife like I've
[1:32:33] never been before gonna be a hug I'm
[1:32:35] gonna apply the token over my husband
[1:32:37] husband applied over the wife children
[1:32:39] will have the opportunity to have their
[1:32:41] parents applied the token over them to
[1:32:44] create a supernatural atmosphere they'll
[1:32:47] be able to look at mom and dad and be
[1:32:49] able to see Jesus Christ in them
[1:32:51] granite Lord we know this is a this is a
[1:32:54] long a long menu a long list of requests
[1:32:58] but we know that you love you love to
[1:33:03] take your word and respond to the
[1:33:05] promises in your word when it comes from
[1:33:08] the lips of a true child of God we thank
[1:33:11] you for this gathering like to ask you
[1:33:13] and I'm not gonna open my eyes and and
[1:33:15] you don't have to open your eyes but if
[1:33:17] you just want to say God something rang
[1:33:20] with me today some some somebody rang my
[1:33:22] bell today and I know it was the Holy
[1:33:24] Ghost and Lord I'm gonna answer it and I
[1:33:27] got both my hands up my eyes are closed
[1:33:29] and I trust that you can just between
[1:33:32] you and God and sometime brother Brown
[1:33:34] said just sometimes it lifts up your
[1:33:36] hands as an act of faith God sees that
[1:33:38] God honors that and so I'm just going to
[1:33:42] to thank God once again for this
[1:33:44] privilege we ask these blessings and
[1:33:47] we'll pray that we'll hear great reports
[1:33:50] in the future of how God is using your
