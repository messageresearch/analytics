men the women and everything and all of it it went good and everybody got cleaned up real good at the end and you've got to see some of you how that all of these things has to be done and you know to have a doing and we appreciate it appreciate all of that all of the food and there is enough food for us to eat at least plenty of chicken we had so much chicken to a brother phony I thought he might have about two or three boxes in his pocket going out the door but I don't reckon he did but we we had a good time and had a good fellowship you know all that everybody seemed to appreciate it and they thanked everybody for the you know for the work and the things that you've done in doing it amen you like turning your scriptures turn what we've been reading in 1st Peter 1 and in Revelations 1 and we'll try to pick up our thoughts to make sure that you follow what we're talking about and everything and you know and then we'll try to move on with the thought all right so it was good I see remember the Valentine banquet and February keep that in mind remember I was thinking it was this week but I think it's week from Monday or something brother Doretta names going to the Philippines to be gone for two or three months so remember them and prep the Lord would be with the whole family take care of them and Lord willing this coming weekend but Vernon will be with us from the Philippines to minister unto us this weekend so remember that all right anything else that we're missing I don't know of it okay maybe we got everything covered yeah let's just pray and go right into the word father we thank you for your grace in your love and to us Lord we thank you for you and we ask you to just bless each one of us Father in understanding because that's what we desire more than anything open our eyes to that word Lord we sing it unto the ever service and Lord we believe that the the fact that in the times of the Bible that they sent two singers first so Lord we've sung about you of open her eyes she'll now come on the scene and fill our hearts with your loving grace forgive our sins and lead us by that understanding bless each one remember the sick among us remember releases our Lord and just the different ones Lord that are sick we pray that you would just got each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen 1st Peter 1 we'll start reading let's just go ahead in verse about 13 to save reading you know so much time we read this over and over and over and how it's coming down to to how that everything spoke of this day all the prophets and their lives the things they've done spoke of this day alright and then when it is this word for gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ okay now let's go over to revelations 1 verse 12 verse 11 John is told 11 and I'll told to write what he sees and send it to the churches and all name in each one and then after this voice had told him all of these things see then we start our point and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle and he's hid in his hair was white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the Sun Shine ahthe in his strength now he's describing this one that's being seen then look what happens and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead he laid his right hand on me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and death the prophets said this is not even a prophet this is Almighty God speaking here in the scripture so you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word no I've spent quite a time on trying to get us to see the background or the layout you know laying things down getting it in order to understand the writing of the Bible number one and how that that Bible is still being manifested because it's unveiling its opening up and really it's being written you know it's already been paying I don't misunderstand my statements that's why I review a lot and recap like what I say because I don't want you to misunderstand my point you know God's not riding down the Bible was written the world alright that's in God come down to mankind and then it was started to be pinned and coming down and John he pins the life's part to bring it to us of the book of Revelation alright so then in doing that as I've tried to cover it because I want to point in your mind definite to think on that the Bible is a wonderful book because it shows the past the present and the future right now but listen to what I'm saying God doesn't live in the past he does not live in the future he lives in the present tense because that's what he told Moses at the bush when he said who do I tell him sent me he said tell him I am that I am I am means ever-present right for eternity ever-present there is no future in God now he knows the future his omniscience and all of the understanding knows those things but he's not there that's the one thing that really thrilled my soul to read when the Prophet I begin to read this message and then one day said it like this he said even though man sinned and there in the garden he said God just come right down to live with man and there's never been a time since he descended there in the garden that he was never here present with the believers all right he's never left us he says he's asking so why don't we believe it but do we think about it as that I've got a little cult now that I'm telling you this is a more or less a few minutes to kind of make sure you understand then I got a little thought I want to express to you that I believe will help us about an ever prayer God and see that's the way I believe it I don't believe he's in the future I don't believe he's in the past I believe he's in the present tense right now now if he moved over ten million years if you could click a switch and ten million years would appear you know he'd still be present right come on or you right in with me if he stepped over ten million years and it clicked and that pice was gone he'd still be ever present that's the point I'm trying to get you to see about the Bible and you'll see that it was written about what happened like Moses and almost three thousand years from the time that Moses comes on the scene to peein Genesis right because you got to thousands of flood then you got maybe have however long it takes to get over to Moses and his riding no to me that's wonderful and he could sit back there and write all the way to the future everything to an end of all things all right but yet still he's never present a God of the future is no good and you don't misunderstand my terms I don't have enough of Education to express myself I just use plain old Georgia language there's no Pais there's no present with God everything I mean no future no past and no future everything is present tense well when are we gonna start believing it that way when we're gonna start believing it that way you know if we ever do believe that he's ever present it'll take away the one little word that is the most horrible thing to all mankind and even affects Christians is the word called fear it'll take away that why let me ask you to cuz this is what I want to get to in a minute over here but I'm gonna bring the baguette why should a Christian fear what is there to fear well I'm afraid of this I'm afraid of that what we'll get to that in a minute but I want to cover the point make sure you understand when John writes the Book of Revelations is coming into view and we went through showing that brother Branham who said that God told John I want you to know who I am before we go into anything all right so he revealed a Godhead we went through that covered the point okay then he says now all right said that's not all the story John write the things that you see and send it to the seven churches that is to come all right now when he comes to that he says John write what you see and he turned to see the voice and being turned he saw seven golden candlesticks that was where God m-more feed or changed his form and on the day of Pentecost he came in to the bride of Jesus Christ at Pentecost that's where he changed his form now he's showing you a reflection of himself in the believers all right and he's he does he said there's one lakh under the son of man he said gird about the powder all right can't veal can't be a woman I mean it you know can't be a man got to be a woman because it's showing where it's going since the bride so I said okay now I want you to know who I am now I want you to know where I went or where he goes to in stage 2 or whatever you want to call it so he goes to the born-again believer on the day of Pentecost all right then you got the book of Acts all right then you start the church ages and the time coming down but he says John before you go any further now you see Who I am that should be settled right in our thoughts and month he showed who he was I'm the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end all right that's why I said to brother I said this is not even a prophet he said this is the Lord Himself so then he turns and he says all right now John I want you to write what you see and send it to the seven churches all right now I hope you was listening and been listening and we'll listen he goes immediately to describe the position that he moves over into whatever you want to call it he amorphous he changed his form and he's talking to 12 when he turned to see the voice and brother and said I gave you those quotes over and over he said it's not a not a man he said cause of the paps all right and he said he shows here himself revealed in his bride all right and said that shows where he went - in other words all right now was he following that point then and listening see he shows a wonderful situation I want to make sure you don't miss this one on it he shows where he's at he showed who he was he said now you got that right now John now won't you right now and sin to the church ages what you see he didn't start back over on the Godhead come on are you listening verse 1 2 & 3 he says I want you to see who I am verse 4 crew 9 and 10 he's showing who he is alright he doesn't stop because that's where you won that's messed up see your oneness will come up to that one but they won't move on in - oh yeah they talk about it now listen they talk about the new birth they talk about God in his doings but they stop short I watched that in the Philippines not the Philippines in Jamaica when I preached in that oneness convention I saw where our problem is we can follow up to a certain spot within when we do it just stops me I told you the only thing they followed me I went step by step because I asked the pastor what you want me to do he said my people in the daytime preach your heart out he said at nighttime he said remember you're preaching to people that know nothing about the message nothing like that he said so kind of take it easy at night well that kind of easing along you know but I got to getting a little stronger at night and those people followed me you're to talk to oneness people and they know those scriptures and you look at your songs one of them now yeah you got all kind of songs it was written by a lot of those people that were oneness we see that oneness he stops with Jesus being the life form of God now listen it didn't mean they stopped talking about Jesus or anything like that or talk to you about the Holy Ghost or or what it does or whatever the book of Acts now it just means their their advancement of understand the revelation ended at that point and the only thing they backed off I mean I went through the Scriptures called you know you've heard me tell the story some people had been there and kind of put a bad taste in the mouth about the believers of the message so brother Reed wanted me to kind of just you know go in and and that was so hard to take an old guy like me you know this film I didn't come through Pentecost but I saw what they were the thing they backed up is when I hit Melchizedek I mean they never backed up a stitch on anything about one God Almighty God Jesus being God you can just preach your heart out to the oneness and they lay a menu and go right along with you but then when I hit melchester dick it was just kind of yeah you know I mean you got to know me to know I'm doing me I can tell whether or not you're following what I'm talking about right you know why cause you go to and you won't talk about it you'll just stop and you won't advance so then I know you don't know so I'll back up and I'll come back through okay and then back up and I come back through but to get to point how many in this building is still oneness see now get get me listen you could preach all you want to about the Holy Ghost being in in the church and the Holy Ghost doing this and the healings and the signs and the wonders they would shout their heels off that's you about it but they never saw that that was worth goddamn or feed in to the believers they still want to hold it Jesus only but are you listening you don't mean they don't read the Bible you get me it don't mean that they don't talk about the you go down to the Baptist's today talk to them about the baptism of the Holy Ghost they'll talk we like everything until you strike that one guard just a little bit too close or you hit the water baptism or something and then they just back up on you because the Baptist doctrine is one God I come from there it's one God but it's explained by the Baptist is God in three persons Blessed Trinity but they'll holler you like Amen on one God but then when you say it's not three persons then they just they'll go seeing you know that they're not getting what you're talking about it stops well see then you have to divert around and come back another way go further on said hold that point until people get he said didn't move on he said brother Daly are you calling me a oneness if you don't see the necessity are the importance are the greatest thing that could ever happen in the world to think about that Almighty God never just come to stand down here with us and walk with us and talk with us and guide us and take care of us and protect us he come to live in his people and it took all of those that's why we kept reading in Peter it took all of what those prophets done we're brother Branham would say they built the body the prophets then the body would step out and I would be would be Jesus Christ and he say a body that has retired me see then you know we get hooked on something we we do that one this point we stop and we don't see the future point all right now so one truth like eight or nine ten God is showing who he is all right twelve first way of you know turns to show what he has done all right and John turns to seeing them ever I emphasize it so much John knew who was talking to him he didn't have to turn around he could have said Jesus that's wonderful where you're out cuz he knew who that was but the amazing thing was when he turned what he saw remember what he saw was the bride of Jesus Christ what God in another form they were in no way trying to make the bride greater than the bridegroom right but the bridegroom without the bride is nothing than the bride without the groom is nothing so alright but see the point now he goes I'll show you who I am alright then he turns and he says alright here's where I want you to see my in more fee by changing form and I've made myself known and then he's ever-present there's not a place anywhere if he was ever present with Moses to tell him I am how much more is he ever present with his bride see you're not preaching about when I'm preaching about this chapter I mean you know showing the bride in morphe I'm talking about him in morphe I'm not talking about me and you and Moorthy know we're were here more fees Adam we are the part where he changes from being the one true and living God dwelling as we'd call it won't alone now he's in a mini membered broad not to just the first church age now here's the whole point so get it and then we'll get on to her thought he shows all of the seven churches all right he shows John that and then John sees so much he falls down at his feet you realize that John to the point had got to work he couldn't separate between what he saw and who he was talking about because he seemed goddamn more feet to another stage of the journey and to come forth in bride form alright are you following that C and not back up to wait a minute now I seem in Jesus I just can't see and here's where we are here's the message with I can see them in Jesus I'd see them brother branham oh yeah I tell y'all about right around them and all the healings and signs and wonders and the greater praise God you realize that don't save nobody now you show me where it does tell me worth knowing about wrote around saves you knowing about the Lord Jesus don't save you knowing what I'm talking about and I'm finally telling you five sermons to get you to go from the point of seeing God and were he who is over to the basis of seeing where he and more fit into his bride under their Pentecost and told John to write this and so how perfect the church is before he ever pinned one word in the church ages before he ever pin one word in the church ages he's already told a bride how perfect she is before she ever done one time will get over into the church ages and will see it so if you will read them and just keep reading them cuz you see there will be things in there you know this is good and that's a bad and then I hate this and I hate that you hate to me within the license always ones that what what is the last thing that ever to change to him that overcometh now how do we overcome not in ourselves we have to be in Jesus Christ to be an overcomer we're not an overcomer by ourselves I don't care what we think we are we're not we're that grouping that said that setting her seeing another stage we can't get to it we know that it's talking about something we Baptist talked about a god of glory that was eternal and lived upon earth within when somebody comes along and says hey what about this no we don't quite see that well we Baptist we'd take pastors and we take evangelists and everyone's why we kind of deal with the teachers now but that apostles the Prophet never was mentioned and I was there 10 15 years and the Baptist Deacon so I happen to know a little bit about their doctrine and you see it goes so far and then stop all right kind of like it more said one day he said Java witness or no not Jehovah Witness Mormon he said if you just understood about prophets meaning you could talk let's break down I said let's just do a little talking I think I understand a little bit about prophets what I meant was I think I understand a little more than you do you know that was really what I was telling him but I didn't want to blast him with you so I said okay now we talk about prophets you know all right but listen do you following me God shows who is then he shows where he and more fees to his second stage and when he had more feed into that second stage now here's the points or listen get it he showed the church how perfect she was before she ever started so you're getting into pre-existence I'm getting into pre existence of God I've always believed in the pre existence of God don't you and that's who I'm talking about in morphing Jesus Christ and morphing into his church it is not you and me the church ages is not in you its Christ in me in you right it's Christ in you the hope of glory uh-huh so you get what I'm talking about then then as he shows him one standing in the midst of seven golden Kenneth a lock under the Son of man see not the son of man because that physical part don't show up now you got to remember this is the church age this is the writing of John and Shawn you got to remember what we've been trying to bring when Jesus said who the man say i the son of man am Peter couldn't answer his question but he answered what God revealed thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God Jesus in other words said I didn't ask you that I asked you who was the son of man but I know you can't follow it he's seen him stop right he knew he couldn't progress so he said all right we take this about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then I'll describe to you what you look like because you are Animorph II of God on the earth that's the Bride of Christ and said you'll be like what Son of Man : look come on listen what is it page 12 it's a rise in the Sunna I know it's in the Reiser's huh but Ron said who is this son of man he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God who is this if you're seeing here God in another form called the bride uh-huh now he shows her then how perfect now come on we're gonna we're gonna top some scriptures in a minute that I hope follows is because I've waited and waited till I get a thought in honor I thought your Bible said that those who he had justified want he has already what glorified now we're we're glorified by this glorified nothing you see in 90% of my actions has nothing to do with glorification but what was the thing we gave the quote they were on the internet so you don't have to tell them but you know what would it little Ron said that talking about the bride he said that was him standing there glorified where is God glorified in his church you realize before what I'm trying to say before he ever started anything he tells him how perfect they are we never brother Dale I'm not perfect I'll agree we ain't no it's perfect we'd like to worry about it all right but it's what he says he says those he justified he's already glorified we see we won't student was standing and truthful right cuz we're human we're standing here boy I'll be glad when he days when this body is glorified in God it's already done he's done Satan it that's what I'm trying to get you the same he's done showing you how perfect you are that's the spaces of five sermons this is number is to hit the point of showing that in the bride God is glorified already as far as he's concerned we're already changed we're already eternal we're already that as far as God is concerned sure we've gotta wait but what does that got to do with it now I'm going to say something that I hope goes over the right everybody's looking for this to happen that to have this out brother dad what are you looking for the thing that I've always looked for when I first started in the message is to find a group of people that would believe what a prophet said Oh the Prophet said yes like I said about the madness we would talk you can talk to the believers oh yes the message is here we've got the message and everything we need is here three months later they're gone and and destroying the message and everything could ever be thought of right one because they got so far and they couldn't see no further if you can't see no further you're in dangerous I warn you any time you come to a block state be careful because you can jump on the other side and get on the wrong time are you gonna back up to saying well I don't believe nothing's going on I don't see nothing I know just remember if you say you don't believe there's anything going on then you're denying God's Word because God said he never would leave us but run said there's never been an age that's looking at that this morning never been an age that God didn't live and abide in that age and have a believer for that period of time but listen do you get it then that maybe we can hit the point he shows and he says the sound of many waters you can go into explaining all the whole thing coming down which is the ministers bringing the message and the things you can go through all of that but I'm trying to just save time to get you to a thought chapter one is showing Almighty God and showing the church ages before they ever transpire all right showing how perfect the church is but do we believe it they were really building it no off a rope won't self a note and then don't read my notes Mary and Micah and the baby landed in the Philippines safely so we thank God for that everywhere they have Japan Japan all right there's our they don't matter what country I call it they're there all right I wrote that hand work and then don't even read my own notes okay but now listen why would brother branham make statements like this he said when Titus come into Jerusalem weight quoted to tell the day when Titus come into Jerusalem all those Jews run back into the temple right because they believed that God would fight for brother Branham said not one and I can't find a wording so you can help me with he's either Christian or believer he said not one Christian was in the walls of Jerusalem somebody's shaking your head so you know it's right okay I believe it don't you then why because God had told them when you see these things Jesus speaking of taking place and this happens and you see the mosque of Omar you see that every time yeah but that's got me no no when you see this happening this way said get out and birthday left but around said not one true believer was left in the walls of Jerusalem and not a wonderful thing to think about God thinking so much of the people till he wouldn't even leave them there not one true believer was left in Jerusalem they all left listen Church showing that that Roman bug coming home down no matter why they ain't gonna be no true believers left in the wrong place okay now here we're gonna try to get a thought then I'll quit cuz do you understand that do you understand John is seeing future everything and what he's - right - and who is to do one and when it is if showing Jesus Christ as he lives the church ages is not going to show because now listen do you have a red-letter additional Bible then chapter one I mean chapter one is basically red letter code is talking about who that is chapter 2 and chapter 3 is totally there's like two words in chapter 2 or 3 that is not read letter meaning that's what Jesus said right is that the point we're supposed to be getting when that words the ad he's in his bride so in the book here that we read and we see that it comes down John says and he looks and front-run said this ain't a prophet listen he said this is god john falls down here to worship cuz this is almighty god so you can't put and say well brother branham was in chapter 1 no he wasn't no now you get over to when we get over to 17 18 19 we're gonna start picking up something alright and we'll see some times but don't do it with chapter 1 because chapter 1 totally reveals who this is it's Almighty God him morphing into his church and showing her how perfect she is now listen get this and earn this Inc Ankara didn't be showing her before anything ever starts how perfect God sees her right yeah I was thinking about something the other day just meditating on the scriptures and things and I got to thinking about o people you know and life and you know we're wonderfully blessed people I mean even the worst that we have were wonderfully blessed it don't even pictures don't even show some of these situations in these foreign countries and things like that their living conditions and their things and I was thinking about that and I was praying I said Lord them the poor little kids demo dog some people living in those shacks look at under conditioners you know almost inhuman conditions to look at no running water no bathroom no nothing's and you know I'll you've never raised in the point to where when it rained we had to move the pots now you're the one knows what I mean because the roof leaks so much you had to put apart underneath that spot you had to move the bed over in the middle of the night because he didn't he was gonna get wet we lived under some of those things but they were still not doing but I was taking about Lord how great it is to be here you know we have our problems but those poor people especially that they don't have nothing hardly indictor mercy they're at the mercy of the elements living in conditions that are beyond any thought and you know subject to to the weather subject to animals and all kind of things I said Lord could you just help them you know could you just help them a little bit and all at once the answer came the answer was very simple and he said I said I'm with them they don't look like it but you can't argue a him and I thought about them little kids and even the teenagers and things you know and just living off of what they could grab a heat and steal in Jamaica we've set in aeterna you could see a light up in a tree and and I said what did that brother read he said that's a candle and he says there they're getting the apples off that apple tree well they had a stick and the candles sticking out on that thing and I had a knife blade fixed and had a little bag that ingeniously forever I you say the word they had figured out this thing they had a little bucket and they just run that up and that candle they could see the awful and they just - then it would fall in that little thing and they'd take him out the next day on side of the road and sell him I've seen things like that but the main thing I was thinking about was like animals and times at the mercy you know snakes and all like that it you know and it just come to me said I'm tired yeah okay I got to thinking then about the the way the prophet described things and the way the Bible talked about it and you know in the book of Job Satan asked to try to get to job and what a God release and now you can do this - that you don't touch him but anyhow what do you say to start with what if Satan say now this is not a born-again believer okay job's not a born-again believer but what did he say to him Satan says you got a hage build around him and said there's no way I can get to him we here brother branham talk about sickness cannot come upon us without God permitting it but yet we run our human brains runs hog wild and our thinking see God wasn't there protecting job from bad cold sinus problems now come on I'm trying to be honest and straight with you to get it right through all the way through the Bible where we can say what we need to say did brother Branham was he sick oh yeah yeah well now was the Lord Jesus sick they've run around city grown with a headache after raising it was he subject to sicknesses so when it says that you know he had a hedge around job did that hedge mean that there was no way for him to stop his tow and tire the end off of it and it be hurt him no was it any kind of a small little effect of something of life that he ate the wrong thing and wound up with diarrhea and or something you know see we get it all in the wrong direction that's what he was trying to show me we think what we're Christians we're not supposed to have any time no problems to a Christian well what do you mean brother Dale you got sinus problems yeah come on I face them in with these questions years ago you know that a lot of your Pentecostal didn't agree with brother Branham you know why be Cosi went to the doctor right we had one brother you sit up here he said if you see me and I get cut - - he said you leave me alone he said don't you take me to the doctor I said brother you're dumb I'm just as clear as clear as I could make him trying to explain to him I said that's wrong and this other brother used to come here I mean I face these and talk to him okay this brother he said I ain't gonna take no medicine for nothing well after a while I asked him I said you're taking me Ashley well yeah oh I thought you didn't believe in taking medicine but that's not medicine that's that's I said a dog goes out in the yard and gets sick he goes out in the yard and he's grass he vomits he gets better I said what'd he do he took medicine right I said you're trying to say take no medicine you're not in the Bible with it that's what the Lord Jesus was sick I said brother Brandon went to the doctors and I said that's where your Pentecostals a lot of them didn't agree I've talked with two brothers are used to sit here that it's wired to the fact that they that was why I hurt them about brother Branham that he went to the doctor see there was so spiritual today they'd believe in taking no medication but you know what it's life when I own little with those people I kind of watched them you know and they take him aspirin next thing they take of this next thing you take their night a while they his own medicine it's like all the rest of us I didn't make no light of them I'm not making light of them now they were sincere people honest and great but that brother when I'm told us it if you see me laying I cut having to don't take me to no doctor they'd leave me alone because they were so spiritual but we laugh at him but don't laugh at him because they were sincere in their thinking is it wrong to go to the doctors can I quote you the Prophet what he said one day he said your first duty is to go to the doctor no no I'm sure I'm to pray he said your first time he said in other words I'm paraphrasing it but it's close enough he said in other words I shouldn't even pray for you until you go to the doctor that's perforated but it's close enough you said you wouldn't but you're trying to make it no I'm trying to make him what he was and I'm trying to make it like it is we wind up with sinus problem you realize that if you base it upon what we think as to the basis of our Christianity would be based upon the point of whether we went to the doctors or not you realize that everybody in this building including me would be lost because if you take herbs if you take any medication and take anything that's medicine so you try to justify no that's not medicine that's that's natural thing well I get a headache and naturally reach for a bottle take a pill take a aspirin that's natural to me what do you do I go on with a headache no you don't come on we're not against anything we're trying to tell the truth but tell it like it is because you have a headache doesn't mean you're lost it doesn't mean the wrath of God has been poured out on you it doesn't mean that's got that Satan had talked God into allowing him to give you a headache because those are natural life now we're gonna place it over into something else in a minute so watch what you're agreeing with are different with it you think about what I'm saying because it mean it's a very serious matter it's not wrong to be sick if it is then what are you gonna do with one of these attributes I am the lord that healeth all of our diseases take it away you take it away if you don't agree with it well brother tell you I'm just telling the truth the best that I can it's not wrong to go to the doctor it's wrong to take the doctors word against God's Word now are we right now come on you follow me it's wrong to take the doctors word against God's Word but I see most of you and I've been down myself and most everybody out dwelt with they like you know they can come up you take somebody that'll wind up with cancer or some disease and and they'll come and they'll say by stripes I'm healed I'm healed let's God you can't tell me I heal I'm healed about a year later would you mind praying for me I'm having problems with this you see them start breaking down two or three years later they're dying with cancer we get all of that time they screamed and hollered that by His stripes we were healed who lied what went wrong could it be that most of our confessions is confessions without a possession about it yeah I've seen those things I saw a man one time that he had I guess you call the gangrene there what it was in his foot oh brother mark he's passed on now and he wouldn't take no medication but he was a diabetic man he ate sugar like going out of style I always told him and trouble but anyhow he was laying up in the hospital they're begging him to take his leg off at least his foot because it had already started turning colors and gangrene was sitting I was there and saw him I looked down at his foot and went sick because you could see ever ligament everything in his foot there was no meat on the foot it had already been eaten away I was looking down to just tendons or what you call them strip sometimes with a little meat around it and it ring it in his leg already turning and already getting in the doctor says we've gotta take you no please talk him into taking that off he said I walked in here with it and I'll walk out of here with it I'm honest I begged him that's to take it I'm gonna do you faith he said I said it and I'll stand by it you know what he walked out of that Hospital on that leg and that bullet the day he died he had no more trouble with that foot well our faith there's situations that is true faith it takes over and I believe it now I believe in healing yes but I believe also that a lot we blame this we're blaming God for it because then we question why am I sick Lord what have I done I thought we believed that sometimes he things were put on us to make us think and that would be God releasing Satan to where he could work on us but get my point so we move on because you got us sniffling bad cold don't mean God has put ever allowed ever devil to jump on to you it just means you're sick right because we don't you gonna have all of it going you know every little situation you come up with it's not sicknesses it's a part of the environment that we live in that were subject to sickness many are the afflictions of the righteous he said well you start off pretty good a minute ago but you're killing me now well maybe we need killing come on just get this simple to the point then I'll move on to though because you have a sniffling cold don't mean that God has returned the devil loose onto you it just means you're in the world because who turned it loose on Jesus then brother Branham had sicknesses right because I remember talking with a brother about it's in the message of Jehovah Jireh in California I'm pretty sure at 62 we're brother Branham he was seeing the sick healed of all forms and signs and wonders I don't remember the day it might have been raised and all in those meeting he's going doctor every day by the stomach he said well I was that was the devil let loose that's okay are we I'm just gonna tell you we're a subject to being sick but what's the first thing we do when something goes wrong Lord what did I do right Lord what have I done that this has come on me why not say it this way God thank you for allowing this to come on to me to bring me to him is that any problem we're saying it like that that I can take them the things that affect me and I can come closer to the Lord in that and stay just as sick what's wrong why can't we he said well what's your thought I'm talking about a never president eternal God now if he's ever present he's he with you when you're well and gone when you're sick no he's with us more than were sick because he's displaying his attributes as healer and all kind of thing if we just think that away we cared wait up to the doctor one time and oh man he'd run temperature back that days I mean we talked about a hundred and two nouns running off the scale waited to have 105 because of his tonsils just swelled out and all that finally had to take him out but you know so he was sick one time and that's about all the time ever miss Church I guess and we we stayed there with him brother tied him them was mr. Tatem stayed with us and we prayed for him I all day and he just got worse and worse so he finally said okay let's go to the doctor so we go to the doctor we walk into the doctor's office and the doctor meets us in his office was a nice guy you know he opened up and let us in and just about the time Wade walked inside the door and got in the building they could have done it before then but he didn't die he just walked in the door and about that time he just covered that place up and vomited all over everything you know what the doctor said this is what I said he said take him on back home hit me hard he said I'll give him some medicine to help him in thanks but said he's alright now that's a doctor can I play for them you know this can we help you clean though he said no we got a cleaner for that he just is nice he said but just take him on back home well you know what we just put him in the car we got it my better than ever they char all right but you see we don't think God is with us on everything you know and we're getting a listen trying to explain something hard to do we get a sniffling cold and then after a while we finally realize well hey this is not a major disastrous thing and we just stopped praying you ever do that here we get sick and you get about halfway over it here's the worst thing here's the worst thing of any of us is when we get sick and then we get about halfway well and we stop praying you know what happens it'll come back instead of us keep on praying all right that's what I'm asking you your thoughts are we immune to sickness no but neither is it because that I'm sick you know we'll say and how many people has even said it and you think about it you say well this is on me for the glory of the Lord and maybe you know he can if I die now if I die with it maybe he and some medical science can take this to help other people now in that nice that we didn't help God ain't that wonderful that we can happen run the show you said what I said that well that's that's what I'm talking about all of us has said those things because we're wick were messed up warped up twisted up in our thinking about sicknesses in life families children are born you know deformed does that mean that God is against that family you ain't careful you're gonna have a lot of problems because you're gonna have families where things are born well I I just don't see how they could ever be saved because there's some reason it was brought down like that on that child God don't need no help and don't worry about it the devil don't either he don't need our help but you say what's he talking about I got to thinking you know how the Prophet said it I got him here if you want he said only the redeemed have angels he said now it's not said for sinners but there's another quote where he says everybody has an angel there's a quote to that but then this quote C is showing you where he's laying it in order he said only the redeemed of angels right what is the redeems angel is it necessarily a personal situation or is it and I can show you what the Prophet says it's the baptism in the Holy Ghost is your personal angel now we start dire and then we can go on to the point of having angels but we got to start with the fact that it's the Holy Ghost and then we can go to ministering spirits that are ministering unto the people of God do you realize one thought I mean do you need to quote anybody need it but you believe brother Allen said only the redeemed have angels the only redeemed now the baptism the Holy Ghost so that baptism of the Holy Ghost is your angel that doesn't do away with angels that God gills though the Bible said and I love it to where it says it the Bible does not say the angels of God are encamped about those who theory now you go hunting the scripture you gonna say it doesn't say that it says the angel singular it never says angels it says the angel of God which is the Holy Ghost himself but then there's ministering spirits in the situation of helping each one of us but now here's the story let's see if we can tie something together because our point of the Book of Revelations was what first God shows who he is second he shows where he amorphous and the third part of our thought as to what to see that John in his writings shows God showing John how perfect the bride already is not it she's going to have to be made perfect as far as God is concerned she's already finished she's perfect so those he justified he's already glorified no one asked you a simple question if you are now get the point I'm staying with the Prophet I'll give you quotes for things but then my quote is straight of what only the redeemed have angels so when brother Brown says everybody has an angel now and then he turns around and he says only the redeemed have angels okay I didn't give him this but this is the message the resurrection of Lazarus yeah he's got angels Gabriel minor angels comes yes you see angels everyone has a guardian angel according to the scripture jesus said they're angels always behold my father's faith which is in heaven now he says but then he goes on to what questions and answers in 64 and he said it isn't promised that sinners have angels has angels it's only the redeemed have angels all right now he's explaining itself you know they show the picture of the angels and the little children I'm honest until that child becomes to an age of accountability I believe God gives protection to little ones that's what I was thinking about I think about them little babies laying up in there more buildings over there and jungles and snakes crawling all over the place and biting them and you know I got to thinking well you know what ain't a snake the world over gonna touch a child if it ain't your little God isn't her ain't gonna do it trying to get you to see fear needs to be going out the door of the church cause as long as fears with us we're not going anywhere but see little babies you could think about but he says sinners now the same prophet explained it says sinners don't have angels only the redeemed so only the redeemed have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is your angel but that doesn't do away with your own personal angel called run run said you have a personal angel like I've always told you when I get there I'm will have to apologize to mine because I'll keep him busy I can't believe I got to I don't mean that was a joke I just mean it at a point Oh straightness the life that I've been and where I've been and walked I believe he might be I've done of him hanging around me and I thank God for him what have you ever been to a place that everybody was afraid but you you just stand there not afraid to speak and everybody else is scared you've been mad away yeah harm going wrong all around Unitas well because there's something happened all right the only the redeemed now how the angel well not less here's the question won't ask you if we believe in predestination maybe one day I'll get back to that if we really believe in predestination do you realize then the prophets right if you take it correctly that you were born with a seed in you I believe in that they just don't believe it the way the people of the message try to explain it because it explains it as dissenters and everybody else's God it's just mm-hmm but if you're ever going to receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost as the new birth now already listening if you ever are going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the new prayer does God have to wait till there for an angel to be assigned to you to take care of you the come on you ought to think about in your life sometimes what has happened in your life and thinking how the things just changed if you just just just think about it if you're ever going to receive eternal life as far as God is concerned you already have it cuz they leave justified it already clarified there's the way the Prophet explained if you have eternal life you always was eternal what eternal life always was eternal not to you as a human person because you're not eternal now I'm talking about fleshly thing but Jesus said I'll be with you always he didn't say always I emphasize scripture to the point of what it say he's done with you all in other words he says I'm there when you need me that's the best way I can define that as from between always and always always would mean he would never in any way leave from me and I believe that that he does but I believe it like this sometimes he withdraws his presence and allows things to take place so that we'll learn to love him not a sniffling bad cold I went through that I hope enough to where that you say I failed in a I broke a leg well I tell you what I'm glad God is with me cause Hatton I broke both of them I like what brother monks had one to help he said somebody was saying you know said I've got an arm off for the glory of the Lord well you know brother mode anybody knew him he he liked me I guess that's where I learned to be Frank he said okay let's just cut both arms off we'll give him double glory well that don't fit does it no we want to take it for what we won't you know I stand here and preached a lot of times when my left leg is just burning like fire everybody says put brother Dick's here we had it we talked to the hot off we'd only mean I'm just that stubborn he said why don't you set out I wouldn't hurt her thankfully so I'm stubborn I fight it I'm this human but does it mean I'm not saved does it mean that that God has withdrawn his presence because it I've got a sickness no it just means I've said it probably needs I'm stubborn well I've part out my wife gone anybody realized she does cuz you know I don't tell you when I'm sick I don't tell her what I'm saying doesn't you know needs going around and talking about you sickness if I need to go doctor and it's bad enough I'll go you know but why tell everybody I'm sick bro from EMC and we all sick we all just in the same shape we're all ain't nothing ain't none of us this Christians cuz we're all sick now you just got out of the word now you say woman within when brother branham wouldn't was sick he would be taken out and when the Lord Jesus had a headache he'd be taken out so now you see what you were saying with it now why don't we live life like it is and say thank you that's why I said the other day why do we have to wait to get sick before we ask God to take care of us to not let sickness come on us why can't we pray before well brother John Martin I remember that years ago he said you don't have to wait to get sick to be praying for praying for 6:00 and pray for it before you get it the point it struck into me and that's what I do every day I thank him for healing me saving me keeping me forgiving me plain common sense too and a lot of things see I was thinking about it I'm thinking about God was so great to those Christians till he took every one of them out of Jerusalem before he would allow Tidus to come in and those little children laying there and snakes and things to know and yet they just for some reason those things turn away could it be that your angel is taking care of you I mean was that bull afraid of brother branham our wizard what was any or what was standing there which one was it that animal knew what was standing in front of it you know how I've made it I've made it to the point that I believe it see there for a moment nature saw its master in a man called William Brennan Hornets all of those things I think about him sometimes he said the other day he said Darrell Ward's apart they're mountains he said seventy miles from any human no advise me I'd cut it down to 50 you know at least but he said 70 miles from any civilization whatever hardly and he wasn't afraid what was he depending on he just build up the fire lay down at night and go what was he depending on now brother vesicles when the talking so it's up to him he said him and brother Anand was out hunting one day and city they had to fire and he said you go ahead and go to sleep and said how long no wait a minute he said I'll go to sleep brother rent him and you you set up then I'll take over after a while I believe that's where it goes and he he said he woke him up and or he got up you know and he said brother branham went over to lay down and said he sat down he said oppressors just hidden Gulf that place or the Prophet had been I believe that I believe that code us a witness to him being there to when you're not afraid when you have no fear fear is gone what are we gonna get to that when we're gonna get to the bases here we're not oh but I'm getting older well what do you think is supposed to happen to you I mean are we supposed to be getting older but look at our body that's getting younger you kind of put things ahead of time that's supposed to happen what these days but it ain't like we it ain't no vitamin we can take it ain't no something we can do to keep ourselves to that we're all subject to sicknesses and troubles and heartaches but it doesn't mean God has turned against us it could mean that he's allowing that to happen even to see how you will react what about it he said well that's kind of funny of you then but see I was thinking of this message how perfect God shows the church to be before he ever starts writing one word about her you know actually he shows how perfect she is in chapter 1 chapter 2 he starts telling them about their troubles and what they are and their problems you got the deeds of the Nicolaitans among you one of them was saying you hate that and I hate it too right while he say you got these things right but he's already told how perfect we are you realize when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're as perfect in your soul as you will ever be in life even when you get a change of the body all of the things it won't make that soul no more eternal well then how can why would I doubt him taking care of me yeah but brother Dale you're 78 years old you don't not be going down to deer hunting land 80 miles away go back in them woods and said I am I have a good time and I'm serious I love for people to hunt with me I do I'll Danny and Richard waited on him and all I got but you know what when I'm down there by myself I got a bit worried about nobody well aren't you afraid you if I'll get hurt so what I'm sitting upon a deer standing one day about 15 feet off the ground and The Stand fell out from under me it just splitting with heart and as it did I had already flipped the governor why because I felt it moved I just flipped the gun to get rid of it and I went like that and when I did it was just perfect I grabbed a limb on that tree and just swung all the way around that tree brother for and he'd get that done I went all the way around that tree you know where my feet landed on the nail that had drove in the tree I walked down I went down and got my gun you said did you go home no the day wasn't over I was hunting I went down to the next stand and I jumped up down on it and made sure it's all right now didn't go home Terence was with me one day and I stood my xxx out 6 you've heard me tell it suited up against a tree that's like that hooked up my Stan he was over in another place and 60-month and it's so shielded the sound from that he didn't hardly even hear the gun go off with that gun went off that barrel that closed I'm telling the end of the burro I had lid and spark in my head and I couldn't hear period I couldn't hear he said what did you go get Terence and run to the house no I didn't want to mess up his huntin excited ok I was so dumb I couldn't feel I'm truthfully you know what I done I said well some way I'm still here in some ways I know code I see when I said I better check to see where all the parts is that so I done my hand like this and I looked and had blood on the hand but I had enough knowledge that I knew if I had was blowed off if my hand was shrunk down any all right I'm standing against the tree thinking these things over and I go well thank you lord ain't nothing blown away and it's got a little bar and they was that piece of the metal when it hit that tree come why are you gonna be afraid no I mean why are you gonna be afraid I sitting up on the deer stand there one day in about the town you know hear what my heart write in everything in here started hurting my left arm just started killing me it's just going down I said well Lord that signs of a heart attack but I said you know what Lord if I die here they they know where I'm at they'll find my body but I said I'd be closer to you you're dying then it would be fights on the crime so I ain't getting down I just sit down understand let you sector well light a while all the hurting went away know all the things you come on tell you out no because she's put me in the hospital will you get what I'm talking about well I be afraid thinking your life with the things you've been through and something happened the car wreck thinking about Anna back there Zach's girlfriend you ought to see the picture that car I wish we could get it and put it on the screen really let them see it the whole front end is tore off the car it's spun totally around the whole back end is tore off the car even the truck that run over it it's all back up under the front end of the truck and she walked away asked Yas about it when the day he pulled some stupid tricks he tried to outrun a car and get in front and the car spun out with him and slapped up against the tree yeah he gets a help there's a car right behind you as a matter of fact they were the people that he's passing and they jump out and they said you all right he's he yeah yeah your mom said where'd that another guy Josh said they ain't no other guy said there was another guy in that car with you the Intel about he said there wasn't nobody in that car the guy the people said we saw him walk away well then we news in that car right I believe in guardian angels I believe the angel of God hasn't kept about it but start with the Holy Spirit being your angel let him be your angel and then he has ministering spirits a sign for whatever we have need of and then we shouldn't be afraid fear hath torment I'll be afraid this standard check the situation like I said a hundred to see if all the parts with our I didn't get all excited and all scared ok I just check to see if the parts was not ok they've got it this is the front end of it it's all poor out here's the front end of it that things fun all the way around here's the back end and then it was towed into a ditch everything if you look at in a correct way everything's tore off except right where she's sitting no damaged about where she said you say well I don't know well I believe I believe God is with us everywhere you ever wake up in the night you know why I'll get up walk from time because I need him I walk around say thank you I Love You Lord bleeding in God go crawl back in the bed and go sleep I believe he's tired he said well have you ever had yeah I've told you the three experiences I had when an angel or something was standing in the doorway looking at me and I grabbed a 357 pistol and went after it that's how real it was he said yeah it scared me to death but then after I realized the house was in how it was laid out there's no way he could get out and I went hunting for him I didn't find nobody second time a little easier it's still nervous little easier about it because he realized something's taking place that's supernatural come on musicians I'm sorry I was going to just preach us five minutes on getting you to think about what I'm saying and then maybe tell a little thought but our little thought is one time God is there with you to take care of you if you just believe it why don't you talk to it I walk around in the store that's what gets me I walk around in the store and there's a guy comes walking by and he's just talking away and I want to say yes or he won't he's got a big old thing stuck in his earring he's on the phone right but he's talking to somebody why don't we talk to God when I talk to him all the time when I tell him every minute every day how much you love him well not tell him how you're sorry for your life and things
