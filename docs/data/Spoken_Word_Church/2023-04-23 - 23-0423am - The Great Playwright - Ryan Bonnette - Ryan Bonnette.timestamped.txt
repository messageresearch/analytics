[0:00] in Jesus name amen
[0:02] you be seated
[0:04] also a quick announcement here the
[0:07] Memorial Day meetings for the Christian
[0:09] Assembly of Ohatchee that's on May 26th
[0:12] 27th at 7 pm and May 28th at 10 A.M I'll
[0:16] leave this paper up here for anyone who
[0:17] wants to refer to that and the nursing
[0:20] home meeting for brother Hal Thomas is
[0:22] at The Landings of Gainesville 2030
[0:23] Windward Lane would be this coming this
[0:26] coming Saturday right yeah and uh on the
[0:30] 29th at 2PM
[0:32] just remember that
[0:39] okay and we have a little lesson here
[0:41] for you all this morning
[0:42] brother Bob had asked me to teach
[0:44] because he was going to be out of town
[0:45] but then he wound up being here but he
[0:47] told me to go and teach anyway so
[1:00] okay
[1:04] so we're going to teach a lesson here on
[1:06] the great playwright
[1:08] and y'all know who I'm referring to her
[1:09] by the picture and the fact that it's
[1:11] the great is the great playwright so for
[1:14] a definition if you don't know what a
[1:15] playwright is it's a person who writes
[1:17] plays
[1:19] I don't know if anybody here did not
[1:21] know that
[1:22] person runs plays
[1:24] okay
[1:26] so a drama is a play for theater radio
[1:29] or television and exciting emotional or
[1:32] unexpected series of events or set of
[1:34] circumstances
[1:36] and part of God's character is dramatic
[1:40] I want to give a few disclaimers here
[1:41] right up front there's a few things I'm
[1:43] not saying in this lesson I'm not
[1:44] talking about God being dramatic in that
[1:46] like he likes to strip drama for no
[1:48] purpose like some instigator in your
[1:50] family everybody's got this person in
[1:52] their family that likes to trouble and
[1:53] cause that kind of drama I don't talk
[1:55] about that kind of drama talking about
[1:56] the type of drama that has purpose that
[1:59] has a part in revealing the character of
[2:02] God
[2:02] so part of his character is dramatic he
[2:04] loves to write and act out plays in the
[2:07] lives of people this is evident in the
[2:09] lives of Bible characters as well as in
[2:11] our lives today
[2:13] we are not there's more disclaimers here
[2:15] I don't want anybody walk away with the
[2:16] wrong wrong idea we are not puppets in
[2:18] this play God gives us free choice has
[2:20] been thoroughly covered recently by
[2:22] Brother Wade and brother Bob on his last
[2:24] Sunday school lesson and both Chris long
[2:26] we've heard it mentioned I think
[2:27] everybody here agrees with that I I
[2:29] agree with it full heart wholeheartedly
[2:31] I don't believe we're puppets and that
[2:33] God's a puppeteer making things happen
[2:34] this play took place in his mind before
[2:37] the world but it's based on his
[2:39] foreknowledge of our free choice and
[2:41] what we choose here so I want to say
[2:43] this to you up front before I forget you
[2:45] don't have to wonder if you're
[2:46] predestinated you don't have to sit and
[2:48] wonder am I Born Again am I
[2:50] predestinated just opened a Bible and
[2:52] find out okay because you're you're
[2:54] showing that today if you choose Christ
[2:56] today every day several times a day
[2:59] every time you open the Bible every time
[3:01] you spend time with God you are proving
[3:04] your predestination because it's based
[3:06] on his knowledge before of your choice
[3:08] now so now is the day of salvation now
[3:11] is the day the time to choose that it
[3:13] does not make evil happen but permissive
[3:15] for a purpose like in the fall I'm going
[3:17] to talk about the fall here in a moment
[3:19] uh he didn't make it happen but he knew
[3:21] given the circumstances the opportunity
[3:22] it would and it would take part in this
[3:25] great drama
[3:26] God's great plan brings his word or seed
[3:29] predestined eternally from God at the
[3:30] right time in our lives
[3:32] I have a whole lot to say so if I could
[3:34] get really fast here I apologize but God
[3:37] loves poetry music art and plays these
[3:40] things all show some part of the
[3:41] character of Christ if it's done right I
[3:44] believe God is even in math and science
[3:45] those things at one time I believe are
[3:47] used to prove God not to try to disprove
[3:49] him but brother Banner said God is in
[3:51] music God is in art he's in nature and
[3:54] in the universe he's in all those things
[3:56] he's really everywhere you look if you
[3:57] know what to look for but that includes
[4:00] these dramas
[4:02] and uh
[4:04] so
[4:07] let's just take a look at all of time
[4:10] for a moment from the beginning
[4:12] to Future home that's not per se what
[4:14] the future home will look like that's
[4:15] just a picture I got it looks good but
[4:17] just to give you a visual here so from
[4:19] the beginning all the way to the end you
[4:21] have this great big drama and if you
[4:23] look at it as a high level not a lot of
[4:25] little details but just the broad
[4:27] overview it makes a great big story okay
[4:29] from the beginning to end this huge
[4:32] story that includes all kind of
[4:34] characters all kind of people and
[4:35] overall kind of times and events and and
[4:38] circumstances but it's a big drama and
[4:40] it all took place in the mind of God
[4:42] before the world and we're seeing it
[4:43] lived out today
[4:45] now you get a little bit on the lower
[4:47] level you can get down into the lives of
[4:49] individual characters say just in the
[4:51] Bible for example get down to the
[4:53] nitty-gritty of their lives their
[4:54] individual lives were a drama in this
[4:56] big drama and he'd get down on a lower
[4:58] level
[4:59] the events that happen in their life
[5:00] were little bitty mini dramas inside of
[5:02] the drama of their own life so they're
[5:04] just layers and layers of this that's
[5:06] just it's uh just these plays these
[5:08] dramas stories whatever you want to call
[5:10] it that all manifests some part of the
[5:12] character of Christ
[5:14] so in any drama there's these certain
[5:16] elements and I'm not an expert on drama
[5:19] just Google some of this to see which
[5:20] ones compare one's definitely there
[5:23] there's an antagonist there's got to be
[5:25] that antagonist which is the bad guy the
[5:27] enemy so
[5:29] let's take a look at Genesis for a
[5:31] minute in the beginning let's look at
[5:33] where these start to come into the
[5:34] picture so you have first just like a
[5:36] novel or story or a movie or whatever
[5:38] you have this beautiful scene you have a
[5:40] happy family and then you know you kind
[5:42] of fast forward to the end and they all
[5:44] live happily ever after at the beginning
[5:45] they seem to be happy but somewhere in
[5:47] the middle there's got to be this
[5:48] element of the antagonist the conflict
[5:51] the conflict resolution all those things
[5:52] for to draw you into the story but in
[5:55] this case that's not it's not just to
[5:58] draw you into the story it's more like
[6:00] to manifest the character of Christ
[6:02] because in the beginning was this
[6:04] beautiful scene okay uh of Adam and Eve
[6:07] they walked with the Lord and she wasn't
[6:09] she wasn't even the time she was Adam's
[6:11] wife the woman but they had Fellowship
[6:13] communion they walked together and Gabby
[6:16] and I've often just as husband and wife
[6:18] kind of pondered suppose that maybe the
[6:20] Lord I'm not saying he did but maybe
[6:22] just speculating maybe he would have
[6:24] been walking them along in the garden
[6:25] and saying consider the Lily consider
[6:27] like he did with the disciples sometime
[6:28] later on like he did in the gospels
[6:30] consider the Lily and and talk about the
[6:33] Lily how it manifest part of his
[6:34] character and then the Rock and the
[6:36] river and the mountain and all those
[6:37] type of things because everything
[6:38] portrays something about the character
[6:40] of Christ maybe one day he came up on a
[6:43] rock and he said now Adam you eat my
[6:44] children this represents my uh my
[6:47] Revelation I'm sharing with you a
[6:49] revelation of me I'm sharing you with
[6:51] you my character so you know what I am
[6:52] you're fortified and you're safe behind
[6:54] that rock and it's solid they might have
[6:56] handled it said yeah Lord It's solid
[6:58] it's it's firm but then he might have
[7:00] said something like but it also
[7:02] represents salvation and they might have
[7:04] said what do you mean salvation because
[7:07] they had no way to know so he might have
[7:09] said well you know hold that thought
[7:10] just wait just a little while you'll
[7:12] find out because that's part of the
[7:14] story and in Comes This antagonist
[7:17] the serpent okay well really the devil
[7:19] and the serpent now as he comes into the
[7:21] stage here uh there's this conflict
[7:24] right off the bat right at the very
[7:25] beginning of the story there's this
[7:26] great conflict called the fall
[7:28] and then just hitting high level here
[7:30] not getting in too much detail uh after
[7:32] that is the protagonist uh brings in
[7:35] which is Christ okay
[7:37] the devil and Christ are throughout the
[7:40] entire story in different forms wearing
[7:42] different masks they appear all
[7:44] throughout this great story and uh in
[7:46] different people you know brother Banner
[7:47] said God takes his man but not his
[7:49] Spirit the devil takes his map not his
[7:51] spirit so they're acting throughout this
[7:52] whole entire drama wearing different
[7:54] masks the antagonists took on the form
[7:56] there of the serpent but there's uh but
[7:59] then here comes the protagonist Christ
[8:00] and he says I'll put enmity between the
[8:02] seat of the servancy of the woman and he
[8:04] fulfills that at Calvary so Calvary was
[8:06] the ultimate conflict resolution it
[8:08] solved everything every problem caused
[8:10] by the fall and then and of course the
[8:13] battle and then the guy gets the girl
[8:14] rides off into the future home so just
[8:16] be Christ and the bride and it's a
[8:19] beautiful happy ever after for all those
[8:20] that are affected by Redemption because
[8:22] like by the way he's been talking about
[8:23] Redemption doesn't affect just Christ in
[8:25] the bride it's it's not just the bride
[8:27] it's all these other groups involved in
[8:30] this great big drama beautiful story
[8:32] such a beautiful story and we're all a
[8:34] part of it in Genesis it doesn't ever
[8:37] refer to this creation as being perfect
[8:40] though it's without flaw that we're no
[8:42] flaws because God made it but it keeps
[8:45] referring to over and over again that
[8:46] God saw the light that it was good God
[8:48] saw this and that it was good over and
[8:49] over again it mentions good but again
[8:51] it's like perfect now there's a
[8:53] difference there and the strongest
[8:54] concordance good means Pleasant or
[8:56] agreeable this is what brother Bob got
[8:57] into Wednesday night
[8:59] um perfect though is having reaches in
[9:01] complete in other words completing all
[9:04] its parts full grown full age full
[9:05] maturity and that kind of thing so when
[9:08] God does anything including his creation
[9:10] here it was good but there had to be
[9:12] this conflict in order to bring
[9:14] perfection in time over time over the
[9:16] space of this period that we've entered
[9:19] into called time
[9:21] so it all had a purpose in there every
[9:23] good gift and every perfect gift is from
[9:26] above and cometh down from the Father of
[9:28] Lights with him there's no variableness
[9:29] neither side of turning of his own will
[9:31] be God he us with the word of truth that
[9:33] we should be a kind of first fruits of
[9:34] his creature there is good and perfect
[9:37] differentiated there in that verse James
[9:39] one good is of good Constitution or
[9:42] nature useful salutary good Pleasant
[9:44] agreeable think about it's your new
[9:45] birth you're coming to a position where
[9:47] you're agreeable the spirit of you
[9:49] agrees with the word so you keep on
[9:51] going you're good but you're not perfect
[9:52] you're not complete you still have to
[9:54] keep going on to completion so many
[9:56] people stop it good but let's keep going
[9:58] on to completion perfection
[10:00] perfect means brought to its end
[10:02] finished wanting nothing necessary to
[10:03] complete this completeness consummate
[10:06] human integrity and virtue of men full
[10:08] grown adult of full age mature okay
[10:13] so the people in the Bible likely did
[10:16] not know that God was making their life
[10:18] a part of his great drama
[10:20] could he be making our lives a part of
[10:21] his drama as well
[10:24] let's consider that elements of a drama
[10:26] or play that you have settings you have
[10:28] character plot protagonist antagonist
[10:30] that's the good guy bad guy you have the
[10:32] dialogue the acts and scenes
[10:35] think of the Bible you have conflict or
[10:37] tension and then there's a climax
[10:39] there's a conflict resolution or I don't
[10:42] have to look up that we're gonna say it
[10:43] I had to wrote down here the day Newman
[10:46] I never I never knew that word day
[10:48] Newman I think it's how it's pronounced
[10:50] so a resolution okay is reached Jeremiah
[10:54] 29 for I know the thoughts that I think
[10:56] towards you say the Lord thoughts of
[10:58] peace and not have evil to give you an
[11:00] expected in your script
[11:02] personally catered to you was written in
[11:05] the mind of God before the world he had
[11:07] it in his mind it's your part of you
[11:10] know his eternal life he had that for
[11:12] you laid out okay he has a journey for
[11:14] you to go through a drama for you to go
[11:15] through and it's all based on your free
[11:18] choice here so what you're choosing now
[11:21] okay is is what that's based on he has
[11:24] your script in his mind you just attach
[11:26] yourself to it in the New Birth Journey
[11:28] okay
[11:29] this is our own brother Bob Wednesday
[11:31] night he started your Revelation this is
[11:33] his quote okay this is what he said not
[11:35] brother Brown okay I'm just saying this
[11:37] is what he said it was profound he
[11:39] started your Revelation he's going to
[11:41] finish it he's going to bring it to an
[11:42] end he started it and finishes it he
[11:45] started the whole thing he's going to
[11:46] finish it he said the first was Reuben
[11:48] the last was Benjamin the birth
[11:49] birthstone of Reuben was Jasper the
[11:51] birthstone of Benjamin was sardine he
[11:53] was to look upon his Reuben and Benjamin
[11:55] first and last he that was which is and
[11:57] shall come he's Alpha in the Greek
[11:58] alphabet Omega in the Greek alphabet he
[12:00] was the first and last he was from
[12:02] Benjamin Rubin Ruben to Benjamin what is
[12:05] it speaking of that he is the author of
[12:08] your faith and he's your finisher he's
[12:09] the same voice the whole time I remember
[12:11] him talking Wednesday night about a
[12:12] voice
[12:13] same voice you hear through your whole
[12:14] journey and the one that started the
[12:17] work is able to finish it he's the one
[12:19] for moving to Benjamin Jasper's hardest
[12:20] it's a journey a process that God has
[12:23] been dealing with you as he takes you on
[12:25] a journey like he took Abraham on Ruth
[12:28] on an Israel on all these stories dramas
[12:31] stories in the Bible David and Abraham
[12:34] and Moses every one of them you can go
[12:36] back and see that they started from
[12:38] somewhere and God took him to a place of
[12:40] completion
[12:41] I'm talking about that your life this is
[12:43] later in that Wednesday night I'm
[12:44] talking about your life that has to be
[12:45] Vindicated your life has to be proven
[12:47] scripturally that matches up with the
[12:48] Bible that's the kind of person God is
[12:50] going to take in body change that's why
[12:52] you know as we're studying these things
[12:53] out these sermons The brother and a
[12:55] priests the little stories are just kind
[12:58] of woven in here for a purpose to build
[12:59] up our faith to give us revelation of
[13:01] something that maybe was previously
[13:03] hidden
[13:04] from who is this Melchizedek and after
[13:06] you recognize the very word of God was
[13:07] Eagle food you left the other thing you
[13:09] have been formed in the living image of
[13:11] the Living God you heard from your
[13:12] theophany
[13:14] okay
[13:16] Hebrews 11 contains which is what we're
[13:18] on in Sunday school brother Bob's been
[13:20] on Hebrews 11. contains examples of
[13:22] plays written in the lives of real
[13:23] people in the Bible these were not
[13:25] fiction none of this is fiction it's all
[13:27] real the word of God is so real it's so
[13:29] alive it's a living thing I hate to say
[13:31] thing but it's God in letter form that
[13:33] logos that condescended out of Elohim to
[13:36] be revealed they show different parts
[13:38] about the character of Christ many
[13:40] people in the Bible acted the character
[13:42] and purpose of Christ without knowing it
[13:44] their last were examples to us
[13:47] God's kind of seems from out from Elohim
[13:49] to flesh it went from his thought to
[13:52] word or logos to flesh and his brother
[13:54] why he's been preaching from John 1 1
[13:56] and begin with his word with God and
[13:58] Word was God word is my flesh built
[14:00] among us we're part of that okay he's
[14:02] coming being made alive in our flesh
[14:04] we're part of that Revelation God's
[14:06] character was brought back brought into
[14:08] flesh and Jesus then in US it produces
[14:10] his life in us and causes his dramas to
[14:12] unfold reflecting his own character
[14:15] word includes stories drama whole
[14:18] written Bibles songs and Psalms all from
[14:21] the Garden of Eden until Revelation is a
[14:23] drama made up of people and their
[14:25] stories from the unveiling of God
[14:28] I'm trying to skip on down and just skip
[14:30] a halfway down Christ in you how
[14:32] beautiful how wonderful to think God
[14:34] pouring yourself to the human being as a
[14:36] Believer pour out it was a part of his
[14:38] drama to do so God had all the fullness
[14:41] of the god and Body in his person Jesus
[14:43] Christ okay
[14:45] second Corinthians 3 you are our
[14:47] Epistles written and read written in our
[14:49] hearts gone read of all men for as much
[14:51] as you're manifest manifested declared
[14:53] to be the Epistle of Christ ministered
[14:55] by us not written with ink but with the
[14:57] spirit of the Living God not entails of
[14:58] storm but in flesh the tales of the
[14:59] heart
[15:01] okay God uses and think about well I'm
[15:03] going to get on names here in a minute
[15:04] if I have time think about the name Zoe
[15:06] that's become a popular name now I know
[15:08] we have it so we
[15:10] um well two's always anyway it's always
[15:11] a popular name it means the life of God
[15:13] I think
[15:14] um there's a lot of a lot about names
[15:16] we're going to get into here just want
[15:18] to mention that while I was thinking God
[15:19] uses drama to reveal his character and
[15:22] attributes the elements of drama are
[15:24] very effective in achieving this
[15:25] especially through the law of opposition
[15:27] and we wouldn't appreciate day if it
[15:29] wasn't for night we wouldn't appreciate
[15:30] Health if it wasn't for being sick every
[15:32] now and then the conflict and subsequent
[15:35] resolution make known as mighty power
[15:36] it's all part of his great love letter
[15:38] to make himself known
[15:40] okay the trial that we face in our
[15:43] spiritual journey as part of the drama
[15:45] all right so the benefits are like
[15:47] confidence that God is with you when you
[15:49] start seeing what I'm fixing to talk
[15:50] about you'll see you'll have confidence
[15:51] in the Lord here's those examples I want
[15:53] to get to these as quick as I can
[15:56] okay so brother Branham he was preaching
[15:59] on this day as a scripture fulfilled and
[16:01] y'all I'm sure y'all probably remember
[16:03] what happened there there was two pages
[16:04] stuck together in his Bible stuck
[16:06] perfectly together think of the drama
[16:08] this is one of those dramas I'm talking
[16:09] about as an example
[16:10] two pages stuck perfectly together and I
[16:12] was reading from the 17th chapter
[16:14] instead of the 16th well I said it's all
[16:16] finest for some cause and just as plain
[16:18] as you could hear any voice The Voice
[16:19] came to me and said he entered into
[16:21] Nazareth what he was brought up at and
[16:23] went to the synagogue and it was his cut
[16:24] as was his custom and the priest gave
[16:26] him the scripture talking about Jesus
[16:28] now
[16:28] to read and read Isaiah 61 and when he
[16:31] read the scripture he sat down handed
[16:33] the priests back the Bible the Bookman
[16:34] sat down all the odds of Congress were
[16:36] upon Him precious word proceeded from
[16:38] his mouth and he said this day is the
[16:39] scripture fulfilled that actually
[16:41] happened again and here on this uh 1965
[16:45] brother banham there was a a pre uh what
[16:48] he called a priest Catholic priest on
[16:50] platform I think behind him brother
[16:52] balance paid his stuff together and this
[16:54] Catholic priest came up and hand in the
[16:56] Bible and he read it from him from that
[16:57] from his Bible and you know it's just
[16:59] one of those little dramas that's
[17:00] vindicating brother bannon's Ministry
[17:02] and vindicating I think I was still here
[17:04] doing these things living them out in
[17:05] our lives
[17:08] this is the type of thing I want you to
[17:10] look for in your life though this
[17:11] doesn't help you to see these things
[17:13] that I see in my life it's for my
[17:14] comfort and confidence in the Lord know
[17:16] that he's been there with me but a lot
[17:18] of you know I drive a chicken truck
[17:19] which is depicted there on the left and
[17:22] um I realized the years after doing this
[17:24] I go in at night I drive till you know
[17:27] 10 at night 11 o'clock at night all up
[17:28] to about noon the next day so drive all
[17:30] night part of the next day
[17:32] and while I'm driving at night I'm
[17:33] thinking about the Lord meditating on
[17:35] his word that's my prayer closet you
[17:36] know that's where I meet the Lord
[17:38] and while I'm there I was sometime back
[17:40] a while back I was thinking brother bam
[17:42] told that story of the drama of the
[17:45] testimony in the sea and the disciples
[17:46] were out at Sea as they fished at night
[17:48] I don't know if they always did but they
[17:50] did some fish at night
[17:52] and they'll drag this net along as they
[17:54] catch their fish and talk about the Lord
[17:56] and talk about his mighty works and
[17:57] that's what I'm doing a chicken truck
[17:58] I'm dragging a net big old metal net
[18:00] with same type of animals dumb brute
[18:03] animals with no mind totally mindless
[18:06] animals taking them to the market so to
[18:08] speak to sell them make living for my
[18:09] family while I think of the Lord so I'm
[18:11] living the life of a disciple in 2014. I
[18:14] no sorry that was another year 2023 I
[18:17] realized it back several years ago
[18:18] anyway
[18:19] a little quick story about mining I have
[18:21] his first meeting there was a lot of
[18:23] symbology and remember brother Bob
[18:25] talking the wall back about symbols in
[18:26] the Bible God still uses symbols there's
[18:28] lost symbols in our life and things that
[18:30] mean things our names mean things and a
[18:33] lot of times these symbols in our life
[18:34] are meaningful before Gavin and I met we
[18:37] both wanted a marriage that had Christ a
[18:39] christ-centered marriage whereas a holy
[18:42] matrimony where you put Christ in the
[18:44] marriage by reading the Bible and
[18:45] praying as a couple
[18:46] and then when you have kids do it with
[18:48] your kids likewise that's what we wanted
[18:50] and then the day I met her at Monticello
[18:53] camp in Kentucky
[18:55] um that was she was sitting on a rock
[18:57] between two trees which was symbolic of
[18:58] it I didn't realize this till years
[19:00] after we got married this is where
[19:02] meditation comes in when you go back and
[19:03] review these things in your life that
[19:05] are kind of like captured in time it's
[19:07] past it's over with but you still have
[19:09] memory of it you can go back and review
[19:10] your spiritual journey your natural
[19:12] journey and the word of God and meditate
[19:15] on all those things and begin to see
[19:16] God's been there the whole time it
[19:19] wasn't just by chance you married that
[19:21] certain person it wasn't just by chance
[19:22] you got that job it wasn't just by
[19:24] chance you wanna put your tear you know
[19:26] there's so many things that God ordained
[19:28] in the life of a Believer if you're in
[19:30] Christ he's leading you believe me he's
[19:32] leading you all the way
[19:33] so there was a rock representing Christ
[19:35] and two trees representing mine and
[19:37] Gary's lives consecrated to Christ okay
[19:39] I didn't say Whoopi I got to marry that
[19:41] girl no I just said good to meet you God
[19:43] bless you would you come in and
[19:45] fellowship that's all I went to meet her
[19:46] for because we were there's all these
[19:47] clicks you know how clicks form and I
[19:49] was in a clip with sister Joyce and some
[19:51] other people and I saw her sitting
[19:53] myself and I just went to invite her in
[19:54] and that was it just walked away didn't
[19:57] think anything of her but there was
[19:58] those symbologies there the Lord had my
[20:01] wife set on a rock between two trees
[20:02] symbolizing what marriage we would form
[20:04] later and our Rings she picked them they
[20:07] had uh she liked the crosses on but they
[20:10] have again that same thing diamonds in
[20:12] the Middle with crosses rocks lacrosses
[20:14] on either side another thing the story
[20:17] the brother Branham that he told about
[20:19] the Army packing boy he went to meet
[20:21] this certain girl he was I'm not going
[20:23] to go over the whole story it's really
[20:24] long but basically the guy owns the
[20:26] Armory Packing Company his son wanted to
[20:28] get married went out west to a ranch guy
[20:31] there had some daughters he went to me
[20:33] them and he was interested in getting
[20:35] married meeting a wife getting married
[20:37] they were all forward and flirty so went
[20:39] on the back porch and met this other
[20:41] girl that was an orphan and backward and
[20:44] bashful and kind of ragged dress but
[20:47] modest and all that so he went looking
[20:50] for character he went on that porch
[20:51] found the one he wanted to marry when I
[20:53] went to Kentucky that camp I was at the
[20:56] moment on the back side of the camp like
[20:58] the boy trying to get away from a Flirty
[21:00] Girl like the boy some of y'all know her
[21:02] okay she's not that way anymore she's
[21:04] married happy and grown up but she was a
[21:06] flirty little girl at the time this
[21:07] other certain person I was trying to get
[21:09] away from her
[21:10] that's when I met my wife just like the
[21:12] boy in the story I was about the same
[21:13] age as the boy in the story and
[21:16] um when over there and met her didn't
[21:18] think anything of it and but we met on
[21:20] the back side of that camp and here's
[21:21] this girl like the girl in the story
[21:23] orphan she was a life a cousin to a life
[21:26] of servitude just like the girl in the
[21:27] story not real fancy dress but modest
[21:30] everything I was looking for a Godly
[21:31] Christian girl that would be willing to
[21:33] put Christ in marriage and backward and
[21:36] blushy because that's what I was looking
[21:37] for God knows my heart after we met
[21:41] the youth that camp put on a play that
[21:44] was based on that story after it just
[21:46] happened in the middle of the camp in
[21:48] front of everybody this little drama of
[21:50] us meeting just like the boy and the
[21:51] girl in that story those kids put on
[21:53] that play
[21:55] on the camp I didn't understand that
[21:57] story at the time I didn't know the song
[21:58] the promise from the Kaufman family but
[22:00] they played that song and acted that
[22:02] drama out really weird
[22:05] and it was years into our marriage until
[22:07] I realized that that's why I was saying
[22:08] don't forget these things that happened
[22:09] and meditate on when Ava was born she
[22:12] almost died at three days old our trial
[22:14] that whole trial was according to Mark
[22:15] chapter four it was just very synonymous
[22:18] with the disciples at Sea and not many
[22:21] of you have faced this type of thing
[22:22] where you're in a trial of life and
[22:24] Jesus is asleep on the pillow waiting to
[22:26] see what you will do if you'll believe
[22:27] him or not if you'll believe he's in
[22:29] control even when he doesn't seem to be
[22:30] there he didn't seem to be there I said
[22:32] Lord
[22:33] my baby is dying basically what I pray
[22:35] was something like where you at Lord
[22:37] that's all I said where are you at Lord
[22:38] we're leaving to go to the Bible study
[22:39] that night she was fixing to die so
[22:41] where you at and then later on that that
[22:44] same night uh I got my rebuke you know
[22:47] he in the story he rebuked the disciples
[22:49] for their unbelief and then the winds
[22:50] and the waves he rebuked the wins the
[22:52] waves and They seized
[22:53] so I got my rebuke that night when I
[22:56] read first John 4 it said he who fear is
[22:58] not me perfect in love that was my
[22:59] review right off that the doctor said
[23:01] your baby is stable
[23:03] she had been declining and declining and
[23:06] declining up until that time and then
[23:07] she said your baby's stable so there was
[23:09] the calm
[23:11] and it tied in perfectly and at that
[23:12] same time we were overlapping dramas
[23:14] here because there was that Mark IV and
[23:17] then here's Psalm 23 we're walking down
[23:18] the middle of that one because he
[23:20] prepared that table before me I set my
[23:22] Bible on a coffee table after I just
[23:24] read that verse that spiritual food and
[23:26] due season and I realized something was
[23:27] happening that was fear and death
[23:30] okay just like David and Sam the other
[23:32] walked through the valley of the shadow
[23:33] of death I will fear no evil David had
[23:35] natural enemies but he had those things
[23:37] spiritual enemy we face so as I sat down
[23:39] my Bible opened it up that was symbols
[23:42] but then there was also something
[23:43] spiritual to happen a lot a lot more
[23:45] than that story
[23:46] how do you attach yourself to your
[23:49] script God's predestinary plan for your
[23:51] life read the bomb pray every day
[23:53] and meditate spend time with God
[23:55] anything that goes under that broad
[23:57] category of you spending time with the
[23:59] Lord there's a lot of more things to
[24:01] that meditation is powerful it's mostly
[24:04] an untimed resource Food For Thought
[24:06] first of all think about the word of God
[24:07] that's been revealed to you the things
[24:09] you already understand they're simple
[24:10] just think about what you already know
[24:12] and then let's see if God will bring
[24:13] more and then the names of meanings of
[24:16] names and so forth that's significant
[24:18] spiritual journey where you've come from
[24:20] how did you get where you're at now
[24:21] spiritually and naturally
[24:24] another man taught about the names Elvis
[24:25] and Ricky it's the name for this day it
[24:27] goes with this it means something you
[24:28] say a name means nothing then why did he
[24:30] change Abram's name to Abraham and
[24:32] musicians I'll go and come why'd he
[24:35] change Jacob to Israel they're meaning
[24:37] to names this requires perseverance and
[24:39] a permanent change I'm not talking about
[24:41] try for 90 days I'm saying for the rest
[24:43] of your life from now on read the bomb
[24:45] private and listen to the word of God
[24:46] like anything in life it requires
[24:48] commitment single-mindedness tenacity
[24:51] patience like by the way I've been
[24:52] talking about patience we are crock pot
[24:55] Christians not microwave Christians It's
[24:57] Not Easy Bake Oven sort of a life this
[24:59] is a Daily Grind
[25:01] that's all I have God bless you
[25:03] [Applause]
[25:24] [Music]
[25:52] um
