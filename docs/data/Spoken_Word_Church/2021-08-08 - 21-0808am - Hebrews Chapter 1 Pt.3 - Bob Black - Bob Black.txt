========================================

god bless you this morning it's good to be in the house of lord we had a real fine time at uh bible study last night we always enjoy on the way home thinking about all the things that are said the comments are made and everything um if the brothers in the back could go ahead and pull up hebrews 1 and they they told me last time that the audio didn't pick up on the recording so i'll kind of go back a little bit and summarize sorry about that i don't know if we know what happened but anyway um hebrews 1. that's all right i'll just i'll talk for a few minutes while y'all get it up um so you know last time we were kind of talking about how paul and the book of hebrews is is trying to he he he kind of lays out that um who we're who we have faith in and and that this is not just an ordinary man it's not just an angel or or something like that or or a minister uh this is this is actually god ex that full expression of god revealed in flesh and and you know through the book of hebrews he just builds up builds up he begins to tell you about how the uh you enter into the sabbath rest and and and showing that this is that same man that walked came to abraham and showed himself and building building up until in hebrews 11 he says everybody else has has has uh has been successful in their in their walk by believing and that's the way that you're going to be successful by believing not now you know who to believe in that you believe in the son of god who's been who's expressed himself in flesh and and that's that's who we have confidence in that we have a high priest who could be touched by the feelings of our infirmity somebody that that entered in once for all of our sins that that we don't have to keep coming back and offering a sacrifice year after year and so now brother branham said about hebrews 1 he said what is paul trying to do he's trying to show that god purposed all things in christ and christ was the express image of god the entire rest of the chapter deals with how that he was higher than angels higher than all powers angels worshipped him paul was trying to magnify him he's trying to magnify him so we'll have an understanding of this of who this person is and i kind of think about um you know how brother random talked about how uh john the baptist when he was introducing the son of man and again brother branham and this day introducing it's like eliezer kind of painting a picture so that you would know and that's kind of what paul is doing here when you read the bible you begin to get a picture of who jesus is and who it is we serve so even though you haven't actually met him in the flesh that the picture begins to be painted out so much that you know you begin to understand his deity and what his name is and all the all the characteristics about him that that and it builds up your faith where you begin to realize that if i i i i can have confidence that if i come to him according to the prescription that that he's there to to to fulfill his word in my life so let's just kind of summarize i think we made it to about verse four the the last two lessons so just kind of summarize again god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spaking time past unto the fathers by the prophets and paul's laying out that yeah he spoke it this is this this man that we're talking about is the one who was doing the speaking in the old testament but now now he actually manifested himself in flesh and now that's who we're hearing now in this in this last day hath in these last days spaking unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things and bill o'brien explains that he was you know he was predestinated for that purpose he was appointed heir of all things he came he came to the earth to fulfill his appointment to die on the cross that we might have have a way to to enter into fellowship with him by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person in other words he fully expresses everything there all the characteristics all the attributes of god were fully expressed in this person he was the brightness of his glory and upholding all things by the word of his power in other words he's he's trying to stress so much that this this man is the one that spoke all things with is into existence everything that you can see is actually uphold the sun and the moon and the stars and everything is upheld by the word of his power when he had him by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high now this is where hebrews kind of gets a little bit weighty he starts to he starts to quote david and talking about how the the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand until i until i i make all the enemies that footstool and those kind of things that we'll get into that a little bit more later on and you know you you got to the more i really study on this you've got to have an understanding of these kind of things so that you get in your in your mind the right picture when you begin to get over in the book of revelation that talks about one sitting on the throne sitting on the father strolling what does that mean where where is he sitting and and kind of begin to picture so you get the picture right when you begin to read the book of revelation and he comes off of the throne and it says now brother brown said now i don't talking about sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high let's let's just kind of think sit down you you can begin to think that there's there's like two people that that jesus is sitting down at the right hand of the father like sitting sitting next to him and then you got in your mind two people but that's not that's not what he's trying to express here now brother ram said no i don't mean god's got a right hand god's a spirit but at the right hand means in power and authority of god that in that name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it everything in earth is named after it and subject to a name above all names so he's sitting he's sitting at the right hand which means in power and authority of god now i'm gonna kind of breeze past that and we're gonna hit it again later on because let's go on to hebrews 1 4. it says being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they so he's got he can't he inherited in other words he it was it was when he came when he was born in the manger yet the name that was given to him was the same name that the father had which is not a different person but the same person he's now expressing himself in a different office now he's in flesh but he's come with it he's inherited the name now now now you know brother branham really nailed down in his sermons how important that name a name is the name is actually it's it's actually so this name is more is more excellent than all the angels more excellent than any other preacher any any other more excellent why why is it where is that so it's because that name that he inherited is actually the name of god and in that name conveys all the characteristics and all the attributes of who god is that he's a redeemer and a savior and a deliverer he's he's he's the one that was that was there to deliver the israelites out of egypt he's all those characteristics are bundled up in that name so when you when you hear the name of jesus it it can that's what it conveys and so so so brother adam said in god's chosen place of worship he said he is god's chosen place of worship and god's name is given to him he is god's place of worship and god's name is given to him he is the word of god and he is the name of god he is both the word of god and the name of god he was the word made flesh he was the word of god lamb of god name of god and was god that's what he was the chosen and only place of worship to god yeah that's a fantastic sermon to listen to god's uh chosen place of worship because in that sermon he's talking about where you've got to uh he's reading the scripture and old in deuteronomy talking about how that god will the place where god puts his name and if that's where that's where you can the only place that's that's honored to worship goddess is where he puts his name so if you can find the place where god's name is and worship him in that way then you're worshiping god in the correct way and and and in that sermon he explains that the where god puts his name was in christ so if you can get in christ you can you can enter into correct worship with god so so we know that so he came he came in the father's name and that's what he said in john chapter 5 verse 43 i come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him you will receive so he came in his father's neck what's the father's name the father's name is jesus christ the father's name is jesus so you know uh you might ask somebody well you know uh you begin you're talking about the correct way to baptize and and those kind of things baptize jesus said in matthew 28 and 19 to be baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost now of course you you would so the question is how what what is the name of the father son and holiness the name is jesus so you know if somebody were to write i i heard some uh i was listening to somebody talking about a plane trip that they were on a pentecostal won this preacher and he was on a plane trip and he began to talk to the person in the seat next to him and they got into a discussion about this and he said about the name of god and he said he asked the person sitting next to him he said if if you were going to write a check you would put your name on it right you wouldn't put father or son or or holy or you know something like that father or son you would actually put your name on it and that's the same thing it is in the gospel if you're gonna if you were gonna get a check from god how would god put what would god put there in this slot for his name he would put jesus he wouldn't put father or son or holy ghost or anything like that he would put his name so you begin to see how paul's paul as we go through hebrews is laying out he begins to unfold the revelation of who who jesus is and he begin to understand how to have fellowship with him because you're you understand his attributes and understand his name and and um let me read this you know what even when jesus when jesus was coming into jerusalem they they began and they were laying palm fronds and at his feet and they they said the bible says they went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord cometh in the name of the lord so they were actually testifying that this man riding in is coming in the name of the lord blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest now brother i'm in the philadelphian church age he said and what is the name of god he was god with us or emmanuel but that was not his given name thou shalt call his name jesus jesus said i came in my father's name and you received me not therefore the name of god is jesus for that is the name he came in he is lord jesus christ and what name does a woman take when she marries the man she takes his name it will be his name that is given unto the bride when he takes her to himself now you see the name is actually what the thing is maybe you go back to the garden of eden when adam began to name all the animals and he would give the name of the of a parrot to a parrot because it it would repeat after things and and so he by by the spirit of god that was in him he was able to say that is a parent and and so then from then on whenever you would look at a parrot you would say that's a parrot because the name is actually what it is now you see that that carries on over when you become a christian and you've got the name of jesus that then that actually carries with it you've got you're called a christian because you're displaying the attributes of christ you're called you're called that because you're actually displaying it's it's showing forth what it is a name the name is what it is and that's why brother branham put so much stress into don't call your don't don't name your kids like elvis or don't name them ricky or something because the name actually conveys what that thing is you wouldn't call your child elvis because the elvis actually uh it's the label for the characteristics of of that rock and roll star that would twist himself and move and had all that perverted spirit and the perverted nature and that kind of thing so if you call your child elvis then you're trying to lay put that label on them and say i want my child to be to be displaying those kind of characteristics it'd be the same thing as like you hear sometimes people will name their their kids that uh i've even heard them they'll name their kids like cain or something like that or or or pick a pick up like a bad name from the bible and you wonder why would you do that because a name actually has a meaning and you put a name on on a child or something like that and it it carries with it the characteristics of of that thing and so brother ram and modern events are made clear by prophecy he's he said that's that's the reason i say don't ever call your child ricky or elvis for something elvis means cat ricky's a rat see when you say that's exactly right don't you never call one of your children that if it is change it right quickly people don't you if you believe me to be god's servant don't tack that name on that poor child see he's trying to convey to the people that a name actually has a meaning the name jesus has a meaning the name the the christian has a meaning there's a meaning to it because it shows what is under under it it shows what you are your characteristics it it remember when david when david came to goliath he said in the bible in first samuel 17 it said then then said david to the philistine then thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts in other words he was coming as a representative of everything that that name represented that everything that that name stood for and brother brahman once more he said what have we got the pentecostal people today he said you never heard that in other days it's a word it's a name for this day it goes with this it means something you say a name means nothing then why did he change abram's name to abraham why did he change saul's name to paul simon's name to peter why did he change his own name why did he change jacob to israel not until he wrestled with the lord not until he ever and and he's just stressing that a name means something so we know the name of god we know that that his name and we can enter into worship with him because because we've come we've we've become part of him and programming and in that sermon that i was i was quoting uh where he talks about the pla worshiping god and and where his name is he talks about how we're baptized into that one body and that's how we get into the end of the name and first corinthians 12 13 it says for by one spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit so we get into that name by being baptized by one spirit and then we can correctly pray in his name because we're part of that name and part of everything that it represents and and and that's why colossians 3 17 says whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus so everything that we do as christians everything that we do in our life is is in the name of jesus because we're part of that one body part of him by one spirit we're all we're all wrapped up in him now let's go back to hebrews 1. let's keep that pulled up hebrews 1 verse 5. so we know we know the name of god we know that that that this man that paul's talking about is the express image of the father the express image of his person the brightness of his glory and now we know the name he said he came that he the name that he came with was was the name of the father it's what he's laying out and he said for unto which of the angels in verse five for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him so he's saying now now this is you've heard a lot from all the angels and and but which of the angels did he say i will be to him a father and he shall beat me a son and this day have i begotten thee so we know we know that he's laying out that he's the only verse five yeah go by to verse five just leave it there for a second but he's the only begotten now you you begin to think in your mind what does only begotten mean so brother brown said in god's power to transform he said now this great creator had placed his created son now adam was his first created son jesus was his only begotten son see he was begotten by a woman now he see here again he's expressed he's showing that that this man that was that the expressed image of the father was begotten by a woman and and born in flesh born by a virgin birth and now he's the only begotten and in other words he's a one of a kind he's a the only one that was ever to come that way the only the only one that was ever to be the full expression of god birthed in a woman come forth without any sin and and so and and uh he said jesus was his only begotten son and see he was begotten by a woman but adam was right straight from the hand of the god of god and the creation so adam was like spoken and spoken into existence but jesus actually was begotten he was birthed by a woman and and the actual expression of god himself and brother ram in the message thirst he said and just leave that up for a minute we'll just kind of so we can kind of meditate on those words he said in the message thirst god himself become one of us no man has seen the father any time the only begotten of the son of the father has declared him that's god became a man so he could fellowship you as a man see and now you are flesh and he is flesh god is made flesh among us in the person of his son jesus christ and in him was god he was god nothing short of god he was god god manifested in the son jesus christ so he was manifest he came that way so that he could have fellowship with you and and go through the same sufferings and have headaches and trials and tribulations and those kind of things he was the only begotten that way so that he could he could he could be touched by the feelings of infirmities and know the things that you that you go through and and be your brother that yeah and so when you pray you can have confidence that you know he he went through a lot of the same things that you go through and john 1 14 and says and the word was made fleshed and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and john 3 16 we've got that great promise in john 3 16 that for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and in first john 4 9 it says and this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him you think about that that god that god expressed in flesh the fullness of his deity and then they took that man in flesh and crucified him and hung hung him on a cross he went through all those things that all the journeys of life going out in the wilderness and being tempted and and suffering and things so that so that we could have a more full fellowship with him now now the begotten that word begotten the only begotten in the in the greek it comes from uh and i'll just read a few more things and then we'll we'll end up here it's actually the word monogenes which means it's like mono genes in other words it's one of a kind there's nobody else like it one of a kind one and only the only begotten and you know interestingly in in hebrews that same word is used to describe isaac because isaac was a type of that one and only the only begotten and isaac in the old testament was a type that that that abraham took him up on on the mountain and and was going to sacrifice him and was ready to get ready to kill him all in a type of what jesus went through that jesus gave his life for us on the cross that fully yielded himself to the father monogenes monogenes of one of a kind the only begotten now in the resurrection of lazarus brotherhood said again but now in the beginning of jesus ministry he's such a great person there never was no no one ever on the earth like him and there never will be anyone like him he was the only begotten son of almighty god we are sons by adoption through him but he is god's only begotten son he's god's only begotten and you see paul's expressing this so much that or reiterating through chapter one because it's so important that this is not this is not just a good man or a good prophet or uh somebody that a good philosopher but it's actually god expressing himself in flesh and and we we're so just thank god so much to to be able to look into the scripture and and have an understanding of all how he expressed all of these attributes and how we can know the name of god and all these things about him now let's read uh let's let's start on hebrews 1 7 we'll just read this and then we'll close on this and it says of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire of the angels he saith who maketh his angel spirits and his ministers of flame of fire now now you know see see paul is beginning to bridge the the from the earthly to the supernatural we believe we believe that this is a supernatural gospel we believe in angels that angels angels appear to people in the old testament that they appeared to to um to daniel and appeared in many different situations and you see it's not a strange thing for a man to have seen an angel and now paul we knew that we know that paul uh angels were present in his ministry and even when he was shipwrecked he he talked about how an angel appeared to him and you see it's not straining it's not a strange thing to be listening to a man a prophet of god talk about how an angel appeared to him and told him things and vindicated his ministry and the musicians can go ahead and come on up and we'll we'll close on this because we believe in a supernatural gospel where angels are present and we'll next time we'll talk about what brother branham said these angels that paul were talking about really are that minister the gospel and we'll close on that god bless you
