[40:32] three blessed be the God and father of
[40:35] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[40:37] with all spiritual blessing in Heavenly
[40:40] places in Christ according he as he has
[40:44] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[40:47] of the world that's right that we should
[40:48] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[40:50] love having predestinated us unto the
[40:54] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[40:56] himself according to the good pleasure
[40:58] of his will through the praise of the
[41:01] glory of his grace wherein he hath made
[41:03] us accepted in the Beloved in whom we
[41:06] have Redemption through his blood the
[41:08] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[41:10] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[41:13] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[41:15] Prudence having made known unto us the
[41:18] mystery of his will according to his
[41:20] good pleasure which he ha purposed in
[41:22] himself that in the dispensation of the
[41:25] fullness of time he might gather
[41:27] together in one all things in Christ
[41:31] both which are in heaven and which are
[41:33] on earth even in
[41:35] him in whom also we've have obtained an
[41:39] inheritance being predestinated
[41:41] according to the purpose of him who
[41:43] worketh all things after the counsel of
[41:45] his own will that we should be to the
[41:47] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[41:51] Christ you may be seated the Lord at his
[41:53] Blessing to the reading of the word we
[41:56] like got a lot of quotes a lot of things
[41:59] to bring
[42:02] out
[42:05] and we're going to be talking for it'll
[42:08] be quite a while I'm sure but we're
[42:11] going to uh make a topic out of it and
[42:14] go into kind of a series of things and
[42:17] it'll be on
[42:20] predestination
[42:22] predestination brother B said it's a
[42:24] hard word or a bad word to use on times
[42:26] in untrained congregations but after all
[42:29] of the years of being
[42:32] here and the things that we preached on
[42:36] these things it shouldn't be any problem
[42:39] with uh you know the word predestination
[42:42] with us but
[42:45] now forgive me but now for those that
[42:49] will be listening and all and what we
[42:52] will do and make sure here too that we
[42:55] uh wind up you know getting uh as much
[43:00] understanding as we can and put out as
[43:01] much information as we can on the
[43:04] subject of what the prophet has said and
[43:07] then that way um some hearing maybe that
[43:11] hasn't never heard a thought or a point
[43:13] on predestination you know how I am
[43:15] anyway I just always start at the bottom
[43:17] of something and just build a slow basis
[43:21] of gradually uh coming upward until I I
[43:25] can get to a place to say what I want to
[43:27] now this afternoon we're going to do
[43:29] something very different
[43:31] odd that we've never done before I don't
[43:34] think maybe we have played it one time
[43:36] over the 35 years that I've been Pastor
[43:40] uh maybe we've played one tape I'm not
[43:43] certain uh but anyhow we're going to
[43:45] play the tape on communion this
[43:47] afternoon and we want you to listen to
[43:50] it and follow along and brother Joe and
[43:53] Richard and him got up here last night
[43:55] and rigged up system to where that
[43:57] you'll be able to actually read it as
[44:00] brother brandom is preaching on it so we
[44:02] we want to do that now it's not just
[44:04] about but I want you to get the point
[44:06] now in the thoughts in your mind of what
[44:09] he would be saying about communion who
[44:12] qualifies uh what would disqualify you
[44:15] um the things but I want you to go on
[44:18] and maybe keep this message in mind and
[44:22] if you do like I do sometimes uh
[44:24] repetitive things is easier to remember
[44:27] now we found out last night a lot about
[44:29] people here that you got to keep telling
[44:31] them over and over because they kept
[44:34] losing last night in a little game we
[44:36] were playing which you know the right or
[44:39] the left and uh we wound up seeing that
[44:42] a lot of people doesn't know which is
[44:44] their right hand and their left hand and
[44:47] you know it gets all confusing sometimes
[44:49] but it was a lot of good fun and
[44:52] everything of doing it uh but it is good
[44:55] to be repetive itive uh you know keep
[44:57] repeating something until you get it
[44:59] brother R said hold up a point till the
[45:01] people get it then move on know it
[45:03] doesn't bother me to to preach long
[45:05] lengthy uh serieses uh I don't intend to
[45:10] but I want to cover everything to the
[45:13] detail to where that it won't be
[45:15] somebody will come along and say well
[45:17] you left this out you know what about
[45:19] this well if we can cover it we will try
[45:22] our best to cover it all right now to
[45:27] me whether it be thank you brother
[45:30] whether it be
[45:32] predestination whether it be
[45:35] um well as a matter of fact
[45:38] anything anything
[45:40] whatsoever uh you know that you would be
[45:43] thinking
[45:44] on uh to me the basis of all the Bible
[45:49] and understanding is based upon one
[45:53] thing first that God God is
[45:58] real he is not just the thoughts of your
[46:01] mind we've been through that through the
[46:04] series as we just finished talking about
[46:06] it and this may surprise you where we
[46:09] will will be going with this series so I
[46:13] would uh pay attention and if you miss
[46:15] any of them you know I know sometimes
[46:17] you have to miss services but we have it
[46:19] a wonderful situation to where that you
[46:22] can uh go in and pull them down on your
[46:25] computer
[46:26] and if not you can get the services
[46:28] downstairs off of the the CDs MP3s Etc
[46:33] cuz we don't want you to lose you think
[46:35] well I'll just catch up I myy for
[46:37] services brother brother Dale just keeps
[46:38] reviewing so much well I keep reviewing
[46:41] to where that will'll get it but you
[46:43] might miss something in that service and
[46:45] not do so I ask you to please listen and
[46:49] it may uh take away a lot of questions
[46:52] before uh the questions come up okay all
[46:55] but but I believe that the basis of of
[46:57] the Bible and all things is to believe
[46:59] First that God is real right amen he is
[47:03] not just a thought of your mind he's not
[47:05] a good thought and the devil's a bad
[47:07] thought you know this doing and that
[47:10] doing it's not that way it's whether or
[47:12] not God is
[47:13] real all right and see believing whether
[47:16] or not he's real will tie into to the
[47:20] point that we'll be dealing
[47:22] with does God know all things
[47:26] yes now does God know all things now see
[47:31] I I try to cover everything where there
[47:32] won't be a loophole cuz see in the
[47:34] series I just finished we were talking
[47:36] about that uh um you know sometimes God
[47:39] forgets because what's under the blood
[47:41] he can't remember but remember he put it
[47:44] under there it's not that he don't
[47:47] know you know he's the one that that uh
[47:52] devides the way to be able to get to
[47:55] where he doesn't
[47:56] remember all right so don't go that way
[47:58] and don't say well we got you now you
[48:00] you now you no no we just cover
[48:02] everything that way you have no problem
[48:04] see you know we keep it all in a
[48:06] straight line I believe that God knows
[48:09] everything amen you've heard the prophet
[48:12] many times say he knows every
[48:15] nap that would ever be in the world yeah
[48:18] and he said how many times that natat
[48:20] would bat its eye that's right and how
[48:23] much Toler I didn't know Nat's made
[48:25] Tyler but that's what he said and how
[48:28] much Tyler that that they make you know
[48:31] and uh you know so then being
[48:36] infinite see then he knows all things so
[48:39] don't think you're going to pull
[48:40] anything over on him right amen like I
[48:42] told you about my daddy with
[48:44] predestination my mother was talking to
[48:46] him one day about it and and she said
[48:48] well you know uh God knows everything
[48:51] and he predestinate he said well uh you
[48:54] know like that to him he he said does he
[48:56] God know I want to pick that bowl of
[48:57] cotton she said well yes he does he said
[48:59] well good I'll go around it won't pick
[49:00] it well see that's our foolishness we'll
[49:03] get to in a minute on our thoughts of
[49:06] predestination where brother R calls it
[49:08] foolishness you know our thoughts about
[49:11] something like that you know in the line
[49:14] of the truth becomes foolishness you
[49:17] know to God because as I said even
[49:20] though he would forgive our
[49:23] sins it's not that he would not know
[49:27] about
[49:29] that because if he didn't know about
[49:31] that to start with then you wouldn't
[49:32] have any sin right see because that's
[49:35] why the law came into existence not for
[49:37] the sole purpose but because it was the
[49:40] word of God but it bring comes into
[49:42] existence to bring a knowledge of sin
[49:45] right to where that you know a record
[49:47] was made under the
[49:48] law well you know if it's that way under
[49:51] the law it's not any different under
[49:53] grace we we don't just play around and
[49:55] say well bless God I'm a Christian so it
[49:57] don't matter what I do hey that way you
[49:59] prove you're not a Christian I mean that
[50:01] solves a problem you know brother Dale's
[50:04] tough and mean I know when he says
[50:06] things but why not say it like that I
[50:08] mean if I live like the devil I am the
[50:10] devil and if I say that something like
[50:14] that then I'm I'm lost all right we'll
[50:15] get out of those thoughts in a minute
[50:18] but
[50:18] now what do you think about
[50:21] it do you believe God knows everything
[50:24] yes that's right
[50:27] what kind of a god do you
[50:30] have you know is he like us that it's
[50:34] peanut brain that you know doesn't
[50:38] know what about it what do you think
[50:40] about
[50:43] him does he know
[50:46] everything I say if he doesn't know
[50:49] everything then why worry about it
[50:52] that's
[50:53] right right right
[50:56] just go live like you want to if that's
[50:59] what you
[51:00] believe because God don't know
[51:03] it y well he's up in heaven up in there
[51:07] you know the
[51:09] work as we covered in the last series he
[51:12] even sent down investigating
[51:15] angels to make sure that everything that
[51:18] he knew was right and would be able to
[51:21] have a witness you know in the Bible you
[51:23] got to have two witnesses two or three
[51:25] so you got to have two so God knows what
[51:29] people will
[51:30] do and then he sends down investigating
[51:33] things right and then he'll use me and
[51:36] you against each other that's right
[51:38] right why because I see you do it you
[51:41] see me do it so we wind up being a
[51:44] witness against each other but see does
[51:46] he know all things that's the basis of
[51:49] everything we talk about predestination
[51:51] there's garbage K's teaching in the
[51:53] denominations about it and also in this
[51:56] message of
[51:59] predestination but how does God that's
[52:01] the point I want to ask you the question
[52:03] today and we just put a subtitle how
[52:06] does he know
[52:07] it how does God know it does he have to
[52:13] wait until we do
[52:17] something and you're missing it see then
[52:19] he would be in trouble because you would
[52:21] have Jacob and Esau right CU Jacob and
[52:25] Esau shows you the perfect example
[52:28] before Esau ever done
[52:31] it God knew right so you see we're going
[52:34] to go back before the foundation of the
[52:36] world as we get to it and we're going to
[52:39] go back there in a way by way of the
[52:41] Prophet messenger that will be able I
[52:44] believe to help us understand all of
[52:46] these doctrines that are in the message
[52:50] and thanks to see that uh some of it
[52:52] doesn't line up too good but now what is
[52:55] your thoughts about
[53:01] predestination what do what do you think
[53:03] about
[53:08] it okay but the main point now as I said
[53:12] keep it on I'm bring it I'll probably
[53:13] bring this in every service to begin
[53:16] with is to believe that God knows all
[53:20] things and he knew it before we'd ever
[53:23] do it right or else he's not God right
[53:29] see he's not God now what he chooses to
[53:33] not remember will be his choice that's
[53:36] right but we'll get to it where the
[53:38] scripture says the thing form can't say
[53:40] why did you form me this
[53:42] away am we get down into a lot of it and
[53:44] just be real slow and it doesn't matter
[53:47] I wanted to preach a couple of messages
[53:49] before having reason I postpone to
[53:51] communion until this week because I was
[53:53] thinking I'd be able to get through uh
[53:56] Sunday morning in the last week and and
[53:59] I could preach Sunday evening on what I
[54:01] wanted to say and then bring out a
[54:03] little something before we would listen
[54:05] to what brother randam would say on the
[54:07] communion message about predestination
[54:11] but we're not going to be able to do it
[54:12] so I saw it and so I just said well okay
[54:14] Wade You Preach Wednesday cuz I'll just
[54:16] take it real slow okay all right let's
[54:18] go now with the thought in mind that God
[54:22] knows all
[54:24] things now I love the way brother
[54:26] brandom makes everything because he L
[54:28] leaves no loophole that's
[54:30] right because remember now brother
[54:33] brandom is having to preach to people
[54:35] around the world and he's preaching to
[54:38] theologians you know that are sitting
[54:42] there waiting just you know for him to
[54:45] make some
[54:47] little verb out of place y right some
[54:51] little something you know that they can
[54:53] attack and and then they can you know
[54:56] come up and say well here's this here's
[54:58] that now he was human he made mistakes
[55:01] now I appreciate the theologians for
[55:03] being that way I'm talking about all
[55:05] over the land because they did
[55:07] understand that he'd make mistakes and
[55:09] they couldn't use his mistakes cuz
[55:11] that'd be very easy for him and other
[55:13] people to say well that was a mistake I
[55:15] made you ought have been smart enough to
[55:17] realize that cuz you make them
[55:20] too and that's you know that's the way
[55:22] smart people are you you you got to talk
[55:25] to them on the Smart Level because
[55:28] they'll they'll try to trap you into
[55:30] anything now that people ain't going to
[55:31] believe it anyway right we get down to
[55:34] it where the Prophet said if you're not
[55:36] predestinated to see predestination you
[55:38] w never see it that's righten that's
[55:40] right you'll never see it that's right
[55:43] you'll have your own idea concept and
[55:45] thought it don't matter what said y or
[55:48] what's
[55:49] read you know talking to a man on the
[55:51] phone one day and he said well so I said
[55:53] well brother said so and so he I don't
[55:55] know whether he said it or not I said
[55:57] you give me a minute to go get my
[55:58] computer running and let me get it cuz I
[56:00] can't you know I can give it to you in a
[56:01] hurry off a bit no see he knew better he
[56:05] knew if I was going to say it that I
[56:07] could back it up right but see then he
[56:10] didn't believe it anyway it didn't
[56:11] change anything in other words he was
[56:13] telling me I don't care if you read it
[56:14] that's right it ain't going to change me
[56:16] oh we believe everything brother random
[56:19] says until it comes down to something we
[56:21] don't want to believe that's right you
[56:23] know oh yes the message is perfectly all
[56:25] right except one thing well see then
[56:29] people by doing that you don't realize
[56:31] that you're making yourself greater than
[56:33] the prophet was cuz if you can
[56:35] straighten out a prophet we're supposed
[56:36] to worship you cuz the only step up from
[56:39] the prophet is God right all right he's
[56:42] so close Dar you got to be careful on
[56:44] that but then the next step up would be
[56:46] almighty God Amen so if you can
[56:48] straighten the right and straighten out
[56:49] brother brandom then that would make us
[56:51] God get your shoes off a kiss you toe
[56:54] that's not nice
[56:56] I don't mean it is a joke I mean it's
[56:59] God's honest
[57:01] truth I'm serious about it my life is at
[57:03] stake on these things but look what he
[57:06] says spiritual inspiration 19561 128 get
[57:10] all this down to where we'll know he's
[57:12] talking about God God knows all things
[57:15] and making predestination for it God
[57:17] knows all things he's an
[57:20] omnipotent he's
[57:23] omnipresent he's om
[57:25] ient he knows all
[57:28] things when the world before there was a
[57:31] star in the heavens before there ever
[57:34] was a light in the firmament God knew
[57:36] every Prophet that ever lived or
[57:40] everything that men and women would ever
[57:44] do he's
[57:46] infinite see all right he wants us to
[57:49] get ready now look what he says and who
[57:51] is this mzc
[57:53] 1965
[57:55] because when brother random starts
[57:56] making
[57:57] statements as I said people are waiting
[58:00] for him to make a
[58:02] statement and then they can show how
[58:05] really smart they are to correct
[58:08] him all now the next statement is is
[58:12] he's a
[58:15] being and he's not just all over the
[58:19] world like we
[58:21] think oh brother Rand I got you because
[58:24] you said he was
[58:27] omnipresent all right we let him Express
[58:30] see because how could one being be
[58:34] omnipresent right okay so we let him say
[58:38] it who is this meled 1965 220
[58:43] uh there they are get the
[58:50] glasses 1965 221 the evening all right
[58:54] right down to the middle paragraph God
[58:57] has to be infinite we're finite he's
[59:01] infinite and he was
[59:04] omnipresent
[59:06] omniscient and
[59:09] omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be
[59:13] God knows all things all places because
[59:17] of his
[59:21] omnipresence right now in the second
[59:23] we'll read these
[59:25] being so now you got a problem with
[59:29] omnipresence to believe in a being so
[59:31] we'll let him answer it he says
[59:34] omniscience makes him
[59:36] omnipresent
[59:38] right how is God omnipresent in the fact
[59:42] that he's omniscient right he knows
[59:45] where he needs to be that's right his
[59:48] omniscience makes him
[59:50] omnipresent he's not on the moon today
[59:52] if there's nobody on the moon right he
[59:55] doesn't need to be there but when
[59:57] someone goes there he's can go there
[1:00:00] with him you know all right do you
[1:00:03] understand the OM omniscience knowing
[1:00:06] all
[1:00:07] things then that way him being a
[1:00:11] being he doesn't have to be like the
[1:00:13] wind that just floats around that we
[1:00:16] think see now he's a being cuz let's
[1:00:18] read it
[1:00:20] amen omniscience makes him omnipresent
[1:00:24] he is a being he's not like the wind
[1:00:26] he's a being he dwells in a house but
[1:00:28] being omniscient knowing all things
[1:00:32] makes him
[1:00:34] omnipresent because he knows everything
[1:00:36] that's going on there can't be a flee B
[1:00:40] is eye but what he noted and he knowed
[1:00:43] it before there was a world and how many
[1:00:46] time it B its eye and how much Tor it
[1:00:48] had in it but before there ever was a
[1:00:52] world that's infinite
[1:00:55] we can't comprehend it with our mind but
[1:00:58] that's God God infinite right all right
[1:01:02] so now
[1:01:03] he's omniscient knowing all things so if
[1:01:06] he needs to be anywhere he can be there
[1:01:08] that would make him
[1:01:10] omnipresent see now but yet he's a
[1:01:15] being he's a person see all right now in
[1:01:20] doing that now that's the basis of what
[1:01:22] we're talking about
[1:01:29] predestination predestination according
[1:01:32] to
[1:01:35] Webster is the act of
[1:01:57] predestined
[1:01:59] predestined all right is to like a
[1:02:02] doctorine of things you know see for
[1:02:05] your point it's to to Destin in
[1:02:10] advance right
[1:02:14] right for
[1:02:16] ordaining are
[1:02:19] predetermined that's
[1:02:21] predestined all right now brother
[1:02:24] brandom used that one time is all I can
[1:02:27] find that he used the word
[1:02:30] predestine and then one time he used the
[1:02:33] word predestines plural so we'll read it
[1:02:38] in other words a message called Jesus
[1:02:39] arose 1956 405 paragraph in other words
[1:02:44] E5 in in St it's strange in Reading
[1:02:47] taking his word how that God way back
[1:02:50] before the world ever begun and I begin
[1:02:52] to see the thing unfold and know that
[1:02:55] God didn't make a choice then right and
[1:02:58] listen to these things now Mark them I
[1:03:01] underline all those but you mark out I I
[1:03:03] would suggest because if you'll notice a
[1:03:05] lot of times what I do I have a little
[1:03:07] highlighter and if you saw my notes uh
[1:03:10] it looks like the flag more already uh
[1:03:14] you know I use many different
[1:03:17] colors that means this one is more or
[1:03:20] less a purplish looking that means that
[1:03:23] that's a quote
[1:03:25] uh this one is yellow that means
[1:03:28] emphasize a little on that you know the
[1:03:32] blue means make sure you explain that
[1:03:35] okay so if I was you I'd bring me a
[1:03:38] thing along sometimes and I would sit
[1:03:40] down and when I'm reading these things
[1:03:41] or take your pencil and you know while
[1:03:45] you reading put little quotations around
[1:03:47] it to where you can remember that right
[1:03:50] all right so watch what he's saying
[1:03:52] now God did didn't make a choice
[1:03:56] then God could could not say the word of
[1:04:02] predestinate the word predestinate as I
[1:04:05] always said is not a good word to use to
[1:04:08] the public right because predestinate
[1:04:12] means perhaps to to to predestine
[1:04:16] something to
[1:04:20] happen but God could predestinate by
[1:04:23] four
[1:04:26] he knew what would
[1:04:29] be not willing that any should
[1:04:33] perish
[1:04:35] okay but that all would come to
[1:04:39] repentance but being infinite in God he
[1:04:42] could
[1:04:43] predestinate and foretell by forn
[1:04:46] knowledge right okay
[1:04:50] now lot covered in that little paragraph
[1:04:52] right amen right
[1:04:56] all right so brother Bram uses the word
[1:04:59] predestine right and tells you what
[1:05:02] predestined
[1:05:04] means it means something to
[1:05:10] happen okay now we read in there that
[1:05:13] God doesn't choose like we think
[1:05:20] right but then how does he
[1:05:23] predestinate
[1:05:25] okay not willing that any should perish
[1:05:29] that's
[1:05:30] scripture amen so it could predestinate
[1:05:34] by for
[1:05:35] knowledge oh brother Dale he's still
[1:05:39] about for knowledge we're so far up here
[1:05:44] until we sailed out into the great vast
[1:05:48] ways of the message and we're out into
[1:05:52] the infinite place
[1:05:55] and y'all are still talking about four
[1:05:58] nights now you tell me how you can get
[1:06:00] to where you're
[1:06:02] at I mean I know that they take an
[1:06:05] airplane they I know they make a a
[1:06:07] rocket and they can just go and they can
[1:06:10] sell out there and they can land on the
[1:06:12] moon I know
[1:06:14] that but you know how they got
[1:06:19] started because they call it the same
[1:06:22] horsepower but means the force of thrust
[1:06:26] is what you're
[1:06:27] using but they still say that they take
[1:06:30] so much
[1:06:31] horsepower to push that rocket to outer
[1:06:34] space and to bring it
[1:06:36] back and you know that started from a
[1:06:39] horse you know the power of a horse the
[1:06:42] thrust of a horse the ability to pull a
[1:06:45] a wagon or a
[1:06:47] buggy you know and and and to make it
[1:06:51] work and make it go the cars are called
[1:06:56] horsepower because that means the thrust
[1:06:59] point of what you're doing now I'm not a
[1:07:03] mechanic I'm I'm just using my own terms
[1:07:05] okay you put yours there but it just
[1:07:08] simply means a Thrust or a force or a
[1:07:10] push of doing that's why I told you the
[1:07:13] whole time you don't believe it but a
[1:07:15] horse pushes a wagon it don't pull it I
[1:07:18] tried my best to explain that to you
[1:07:20] from the beginning I'm an old Farmer
[1:07:22] Boy he pushes the collar the collar
[1:07:25] pushes the gears the gears by chains
[1:07:28] pulls the wagon okay so it's thrust
[1:07:31] thrust Force push all right now
[1:07:38] so God
[1:07:42] then he does it in a
[1:07:45] way that it can never be brought up
[1:07:47] against him that is
[1:07:49] wrong right okay amen so he say he says
[1:07:55] we'll get to it in a little while he
[1:07:57] says how can the thing
[1:08:00] formed say why did you form me thus amen
[1:08:04] right he's very specific in saying it he
[1:08:08] said I make vessels of
[1:08:11] honor and I make vessels of
[1:08:14] Dishonor right we get down to some of
[1:08:17] these where brother Brandon said uh like
[1:08:19] what is it over in Jude it says brute
[1:08:22] Beast made to be
[1:08:27] destroyed Atomic F right plain
[1:08:33] language but then truly if he didn't
[1:08:35] give everybody a choice then he's not
[1:08:40] right so you'll find out that he's
[1:08:43] dealing with your choice
[1:08:46] right yes but that's I just want to I I
[1:08:49] just want to know what I am I want to
[1:08:51] know you don't thrill me brother brother
[1:08:54] Dale you make me
[1:08:56] think and I get all confused in my brain
[1:08:59] no no no no you don't get confused cuz I
[1:09:02] say it I just expose your confusion
[1:09:06] right but you see would tell us all
[1:09:08] about how great we are how you going to
[1:09:10] know that this is the greatest thing
[1:09:12] there is to me is to know how God done
[1:09:15] something and you know then I can depend
[1:09:17] on it always right cuz if you ever done
[1:09:20] something one time is that the way of
[1:09:22] the Prophet if he ever does it one time
[1:09:23] he's got to always do it amen he can't
[1:09:26] change see he said I'm God and I change
[1:09:28] not all right look at the next one
[1:09:30] baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958
[1:09:33] 928 we believe that God's church is that
[1:09:36] seed that's mixed down through this
[1:09:37] realm down through here and it come in
[1:09:41] by what we spoke of last night and we'll
[1:09:43] further discuss it
[1:09:47] predestination not that God
[1:09:49] predestines predestines the plural of
[1:09:53] predestin
[1:09:55] anything to be but by for knowledge he
[1:09:59] can predestinate for he know all things
[1:10:03] and we found out last night that there's
[1:10:05] nobody ever got saved like tonight and
[1:10:08] had their name wrote on the Lambe book
[1:10:10] of life that didn't work your name was
[1:10:12] either put on the Lambe book of life
[1:10:14] before the world began or it never was
[1:10:17] there and never will be there and we
[1:10:20] find out when God slay the lamb before
[1:10:22] the foundation of the world you were
[1:10:24] slain with your lamb okay amen so
[1:10:29] now we come down to understanding one
[1:10:34] thing we'll get to it in a
[1:10:38] minute let's
[1:10:40] see yep let's go to number four on your
[1:10:44] notes then we'll get the backs side of
[1:10:46] that one just in a second let go to
[1:10:48] number four on your
[1:10:51] notes Jehovah gy part two 1962 706 now
[1:10:57] there's a doctrine of predestination
[1:10:59] which is
[1:11:01] rotten
[1:11:04] nonsense there is a doctrine of
[1:11:07] predestination which is rotten nonsense
[1:11:11] right
[1:11:13] now as I said when Daddy said does God
[1:11:16] know if I'm going to pick that bow theot
[1:11:18] and the mom said yes he said well let
[1:11:21] I'll just fool him I won't pick it
[1:11:24] now that's their stupidity of her
[1:11:27] mind right that's the rotten
[1:11:31] nonsense that man has the
[1:11:34] idea yeah all right so we'll get back to
[1:11:37] that in a second the next one we'll come
[1:11:38] on down on some more but look at the one
[1:11:41] that doesn't have any notes on it I want
[1:11:42] to bring out a little point to
[1:11:46] you
[1:11:48] see we
[1:11:50] say uh God God this is organizational
[1:11:57] teachings well if God
[1:12:01] predestines and it doesn't matter to
[1:12:03] them if you call it for knowledge they
[1:12:05] ain't going to worry about it they ain't
[1:12:06] going to change them but if you say
[1:12:09] well you know
[1:12:12] predestination well that means
[1:12:15] god for ordained everything before the
[1:12:19] world you got to say
[1:12:22] yes or else it wouldn't God right
[1:12:26] right God for knew all things you got to
[1:12:29] agree yes right well then you say well I
[1:12:32] don't have a
[1:12:36] choice I don't have a
[1:12:40] choice and see in the message they're
[1:12:42] saying now that it's not whosoever
[1:12:46] will so that's for the
[1:12:48] organizations
[1:12:51] see you know you can go into a lot of
[1:12:53] thing brother dick knows the doctrine of
[1:12:55] the Presbyterian they have it like this
[1:12:57] well it's predestinated I step off of
[1:12:59] this thing so I might as well go ahead
[1:13:00] and step off get it done that's just
[1:13:03] their thoughts you know you know but see
[1:13:06] they call it
[1:13:08] predestination and they think well you
[1:13:10] know it's just if God said I'm going to
[1:13:13] be saved I make no difference I'm going
[1:13:16] to be
[1:13:17] saved CU God says I'm going to be lost
[1:13:20] don't make no difference I'm going to be
[1:13:21] lost well there's a lot truth to that
[1:13:24] but it's not all lined up amen that's
[1:13:26] right all right that's right so there's
[1:13:28] a lot of nonsense in the doctrines of
[1:13:31] predestination as a matter of fact most
[1:13:33] Baptists never known anything about it
[1:13:35] but the Baptist Church was totally split
[1:13:38] back there many many years back in the
[1:13:40] beginnings over two brothers arguing on
[1:13:43] predestination but
[1:13:47] see what about you and I what do we
[1:13:49] think
[1:13:52] about we say well we don't have a
[1:14:00] choice do we believe that like they're
[1:14:02] teaching in the message now that says we
[1:14:04] don't have a
[1:14:05] choice do we believe organizational
[1:14:07] point of what do we don't have a
[1:14:10] choice cuz if it's already stamped
[1:14:12] sealed finished then you
[1:14:15] know we don't have a choice all right
[1:14:19] among the message they're saying we
[1:14:21] don't we don't want that part of
[1:14:24] whosoever
[1:14:26] will we don't want
[1:14:28] that the choice is for
[1:14:32] others how was eternal before the world
[1:14:36] always was and you can't tell me I
[1:14:38] wouldn't always
[1:14:40] Eternal well I'm not going to try to cuz
[1:14:43] it ain't going to do no
[1:14:44] good but listen to what your Prophet had
[1:14:47] to say
[1:14:48] about whosoever
[1:14:51] will looking at the Unseen
[1:14:54] 19594 and he's bringing down whosoever
[1:14:57] will he said all that's willing to
[1:15:00] come and anybody
[1:15:03] whosoever I'd rather he'd said whosoever
[1:15:06] than to say William Brandon
[1:15:09] amen there might be more William
[1:15:13] Brams but when he said whosoever I know
[1:15:16] he meant me and that gives me a change
[1:15:20] whosoever may come and drink of the
[1:15:22] Waters of life
[1:15:23] God coming in whosoever
[1:15:28] will so he said there might be more
[1:15:30] William
[1:15:32] Brams but when it said whosoever
[1:15:36] will see I want to keep that don't
[1:15:40] you
[1:15:42] conference with
[1:15:44] God tiffon Georgia 1960
[1:15:48] 108 it's a very familiar old scripture
[1:15:52] text and just thought on it as I come
[1:15:54] down today and was thinking of that is a
[1:15:58] striking thing when God the creator of
[1:16:00] heavens and earth would invite his
[1:16:02] creation mankind to
[1:16:04] come reason with him now there's another
[1:16:09] one we don't reason
[1:16:12] brother well the Bible says come reason
[1:16:17] right that doesn't mean you're
[1:16:20] reasoning that's right it means you lay
[1:16:23] down your reasoning and you sit down and
[1:16:25] listen to God and then when it's all
[1:16:28] finished what God Said is the only thing
[1:16:30] that's reasonable
[1:16:32] right we see that's the way people
[1:16:35] are become reason with him what an honor
[1:16:38] to have God to invite an invit to give
[1:16:41] an invitation you know he didn't have to
[1:16:44] do that but he did it and he invited
[1:16:47] whosoever will may come he just didn't
[1:16:51] select a certain person or a certain
[1:16:53] group or a certain denomination or a
[1:16:55] certain color he said whosoever will let
[1:16:58] him
[1:16:58] come and then I'm sure that that means
[1:17:01] every one of us has a
[1:17:04] right that does me better
[1:17:08] tonight to know that then it would have
[1:17:12] been if the scripture said let William
[1:17:15] brandom come because there might be more
[1:17:17] than one William Brown but when he said
[1:17:19] whosoever will I know that it includes
[1:17:22] me and it includes you and we all have a
[1:17:25] right to the Tree of Life
[1:17:27] am all right one
[1:17:30] more paragraph 46 Revelation chap
[1:17:34] 1 1960 1204 he's talking about the
[1:17:38] little church has always been in the
[1:17:40] majority like the Pentecostal church and
[1:17:42] Pentecost is not an organization
[1:17:44] Pentecost is an experience that goes to
[1:17:46] whosoever will right Catholic Jew
[1:17:50] proelite Methodist Baptist who whoever
[1:17:53] will let him come it's an experience
[1:17:55] that the
[1:17:57] individual God doesn't deal with a
[1:18:00] denomination neither does he deal into
[1:18:02] Gentiles as a a race or a people he
[1:18:06] deals with individuals whosoever will
[1:18:09] let him be white black yellow brown
[1:18:11] Methodist Baptist
[1:18:15] president what Protestant catholic
[1:18:18] whatever he is let him come
[1:18:21] whosoever I'm so glad GL he made it that
[1:18:24] way I'm like the fell said once I'd
[1:18:27] rather he'd say that than to call my
[1:18:30] name William brandham come because there
[1:18:33] might be more than one William brandham
[1:18:35] but when he said whosoever will I know
[1:18:38] that took me so that's the way we can
[1:18:41] all feel whosoever will let him
[1:18:45] come
[1:18:46] now so that does away
[1:18:50] with our own thoughts as I said
[1:18:53] that
[1:18:55] we we think
[1:18:58] about you know
[1:19:02] predestination well that that means
[1:19:05] Destiny determined beforehand because
[1:19:09] predestination is the past tense of
[1:19:12] predestinate or you know and
[1:19:15] predestinated would go in between the
[1:19:18] predestinate and predestinated and then
[1:19:20] predestination goes all the way to show
[1:19:22] you that it's totally done right right
[1:19:27] the predestinated can be back here to
[1:19:31] discuss the point predestination can be
[1:19:33] what you can argue predestinate can be
[1:19:35] what you can argue about but when you
[1:19:37] say predestination that's why the
[1:19:39] prophet said it's a bad word to use
[1:19:42] before an untrained
[1:19:45] congregation because predestination
[1:19:47] literally means
[1:19:50] Destiny
[1:19:51] determined beforehand right right but
[1:19:56] see do we believe that do we believe
[1:19:57] predestination do we believe what it can
[1:19:59] be see or do we just want to be you know
[1:20:02] like the ones as we read about here all
[1:20:05] right but let's read some things brother
[1:20:06] Bram
[1:20:08] said so go back to number four when you
[1:20:10] notes Jehovah Gyra part 2
[1:20:13] 6276 there's a doctrine of
[1:20:15] predestination which is rotten nonsense
[1:20:18] but there really is a true
[1:20:21] predestination God by for knowledge
[1:20:23] could
[1:20:24] predestinate because he has for
[1:20:26] knowledge now watch it God's not willing
[1:20:30] that any should
[1:20:33] perish but being the infinite God knew
[1:20:37] that who would perish and who would not
[1:20:40] right that's the reason he said before
[1:20:43] Isa or before Jacob or Esau was born he
[1:20:48] hated Esau and loved Jacob his forn
[1:20:50] knowledge let him know that Esau was was
[1:20:52] a
[1:20:54] Shyer and he let and he let him know
[1:20:58] that Jacob represented that or respected
[1:21:01] excuse me that Birthright regardless of
[1:21:03] how he got it he wanted it now both boys
[1:21:06] see in the message they say well one
[1:21:08] didn't have no choice the other one
[1:21:10] didn't have no choice and other one CA
[1:21:12] in the seed you know now I like this but
[1:21:15] both boys twins born from the same holy
[1:21:18] mother and
[1:21:20] father but one was a renegade and the
[1:21:23] other uh was a Believer and God by his
[1:21:26] for knowledge knew that y all right so
[1:21:29] how does God
[1:21:31] predestinate by for
[1:21:35] knowledge if he's
[1:21:37] infinite
[1:21:39] see then he would
[1:21:42] predestinate according to his forn
[1:21:46] knowledge see of the thing right and
[1:21:50] then that way as we'll get to back in in
[1:21:52] a minute then the thing for him can't
[1:21:57] say see because I believe that you that
[1:22:01] God predestines according to your
[1:22:03] desires right not according to
[1:22:09] his we'll read that in a minute he
[1:22:11] predestines according to your
[1:22:14] desires
[1:22:16] okay
[1:22:18] right he it's basing upon what you want
[1:22:22] well that sure makes L that makes a
[1:22:25] wonderful great
[1:22:28] God that he's got trillions of trillions
[1:22:32] of all times upon the Earth of
[1:22:36] people that one day he's going to have
[1:22:39] to condemn
[1:22:43] some glorify
[1:22:45] some uh all kind of things you going to
[1:22:48] have to
[1:22:50] do and yet he knows all all about it
[1:22:56] right to me now to realize
[1:22:59] predestination is based
[1:23:02] upon what I
[1:23:05] desire more than it's based upon what he
[1:23:08] desires right that brings me to a place
[1:23:12] of a
[1:23:14] Consciousness within my own
[1:23:17] being that I do have something to do
[1:23:19] with
[1:23:20] this right
[1:23:24] and then that his
[1:23:26] choosing is not that he just I choose
[1:23:29] this one reject that I just
[1:23:33] just but yet it's based upon what you
[1:23:37] desire see that but it also goes when we
[1:23:40] have a
[1:23:41] choice it goes to another
[1:23:44] point that at
[1:23:47] judgment our thoughts our choices will
[1:23:50] be brought forth that's right amen if we
[1:23:53] have to stand before a
[1:23:58] judgment all right and even if we don't
[1:24:02] even if we do make it in the
[1:24:04] bride there are two judgments there's a
[1:24:07] judgment whether or not you're deciding
[1:24:09] to have eternal life you know to go into
[1:24:11] it uh you know and to be lost or there
[1:24:14] is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the
[1:24:16] body whether good or bad and we're all
[1:24:18] going to have to give an account right
[1:24:20] so it's still based upon our choice
[1:24:23] right we're not hiding anything you can
[1:24:25] get by with it with me you can get by
[1:24:26] with everybody you know like I've always
[1:24:29] said what's the problem that makes
[1:24:30] Crooks get caught what what gets a
[1:24:33] murderer caught more than anything in
[1:24:34] the world he's Perfect Crime
[1:24:36] everything's covered no fingerprints no
[1:24:38] nothing nothing can connect him to it
[1:24:40] what happens he gets drunk he gets
[1:24:43] lonely he gets so down and out you know
[1:24:47] and he starts confessing to somebody cuz
[1:24:50] he wants somebody down in the boat with
[1:24:52] with him you
[1:24:54] know because he knows and realizes that
[1:24:57] everybody's not no too good anyway so he
[1:24:59] wants you to say well that's all right
[1:25:01] brother I thought about killing a couple
[1:25:03] of people myself he wants somebody to
[1:25:06] sympathize with him so he gets caught by
[1:25:08] running his mouth
[1:25:10] amen because that's the consciousness of
[1:25:14] man the part of you being a
[1:25:18] soul animal can go out and kill and just
[1:25:20] come on back he don't worry about it he
[1:25:21] don't have to explain to nobody later
[1:25:23] about it right he goes out and does it
[1:25:26] again see but yet we have a soul which
[1:25:30] makes us a conscious am all right now
[1:25:33] I'm trying to hit everything see the
[1:25:34] word that we want you know and then I
[1:25:36] hit a few things because up before I
[1:25:39] read them because I know what a lot of
[1:25:41] people do when they're turning we can
[1:25:43] tell how many is listening as Wade was
[1:25:45] said the other day we can tell how many
[1:25:47] is connecting on but we don't know how
[1:25:48] long they listen so you know what s a
[1:25:50] lot of us done today when I said pre
[1:25:52] predestination said for knowledge and I
[1:25:54] said that about Choice a lot of the
[1:25:56] computers went flat and they ain't
[1:25:57] listening so I try to put a little in on
[1:26:00] down here that if that judgment day
[1:26:02] it'll be brought back that's right so
[1:26:04] you remember what that man said that
[1:26:06] brother brand said that he didn't
[1:26:08] predestinate according to his
[1:26:10] desire well I don't know that won't be
[1:26:14] no good at
[1:26:16] judgment you can tell me all you want to
[1:26:18] that you don't know brother BR said some
[1:26:20] things and I'm going to say well why you
[1:26:22] you getting upset cuz I said it you know
[1:26:25] you read it I just don't have the
[1:26:26] ability like brother randam to be able
[1:26:28] to go back and tell you the DAT you read
[1:26:29] it I'm glad of that am I don't want that
[1:26:33] I want to be what I am all right see I'm
[1:26:35] just trying to make it into a line
[1:26:37] that'll help us all to understand look
[1:26:39] at the message number five of you notes
[1:26:42] of Queen of Sheba
[1:26:43] 1958 uh
[1:26:50] 125 he's talking about people that were
[1:26:53] ordained to that condemnation that's the
[1:26:55] book of
[1:26:57] Jude all right that's the scriptures if
[1:27:00] you're a Believer tonight you should bow
[1:27:03] your head in reverence and humbleness to
[1:27:05] thank God that he chose you in Christ
[1:27:08] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:10] because no man can come to me Jesus said
[1:27:14] except my father draws him and God by
[1:27:17] for knowledge not willing that any
[1:27:20] should perish but by for knowledge knew
[1:27:23] who would so he could predestinate from
[1:27:26] the beginning all things Jesus come to
[1:27:29] save those who the father saw before the
[1:27:32] foundation of the world that would be
[1:27:34] saved going down to the next Super sign
[1:27:39] 63129 God knowed the end from the
[1:27:42] beginning therefore he could plan
[1:27:44] everything that it would work out just
[1:27:46] to his glory that gives us courage to
[1:27:49] know that no matter what comes or goes
[1:27:52] God is making everything the clock is
[1:27:55] ticking just exactly on time sometimes
[1:27:58] we get weary upset we get hly we think
[1:28:01] oh we must do this or do
[1:28:06] that but remember God's clock will be
[1:28:09] just exactly on time all these things
[1:28:12] has to be this way it has to all be done
[1:28:16] according to his great for knowledge his
[1:28:19] for knowledge for by for knowledge he
[1:28:22] could
[1:28:23] predestinate not by his desires but by
[1:28:26] his forn knowledge God doesn't
[1:28:28] predestinate by his
[1:28:31] desire now that's as plain as can be
[1:28:34] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:28:36] but by for knowledge he knew who would
[1:28:38] accepted and who would not therefore he
[1:28:40] could make everything work according to
[1:28:42] his big time clock that's ticking away
[1:28:45] for he could for tell the end from the
[1:28:47] beginning therefore he knew that we'd
[1:28:50] live in this day
[1:28:53] he knew that this would be our day he
[1:28:57] had had plans for this day he had plans
[1:29:00] for every day and never has one of his
[1:29:03] plans ever fail that's right he's always
[1:29:06] on
[1:29:10] time how does God
[1:29:14] predestinate by his for
[1:29:17] knowledge now according to brother
[1:29:20] Maloney that was telling me about the
[1:29:22] Greek word for that years
[1:29:24] ago and uh you know I I don't know no
[1:29:27] Greek anyway but it made a good
[1:29:29] point but he said really the definition
[1:29:32] of for
[1:29:34] knowledge you know and things like that
[1:29:36] it is simple in uh Greek or Hebrew
[1:29:40] terminologies it means that you're
[1:29:42] standing
[1:29:44] looking with totally unlimited
[1:29:49] eyesight you know well now you know what
[1:29:53] Einstein said you'll see
[1:29:55] right Einstein says if you're looking
[1:29:58] out
[1:29:59] totally with unlimited
[1:30:02] eyesight that you're looking at the back
[1:30:04] of your head he said because everything
[1:30:07] is in a circle
[1:30:09] right it comes right around you see the
[1:30:11] back of your head because everything is
[1:30:13] in a circle there's no such thing as all
[1:30:15] of these things as we think about it
[1:30:17] everything is in a circle we're moving
[1:30:19] in a circle we're not it's not you know
[1:30:21] and and see but see now the word then
[1:30:24] meaning
[1:30:28] unlimited see to see that God before the
[1:30:33] world would ever even begin before there
[1:30:36] was anything whatsoever in any air space
[1:30:40] or anything that we can calculate of
[1:30:42] what we call this
[1:30:45] realm that God in his for
[1:30:48] knowledge could look all the way down
[1:30:51] through time
[1:30:53] and not make you and I do anything
[1:30:56] that's
[1:30:59] right but know what to do to contact us
[1:31:04] and I know what the organization say
[1:31:06] about that and I wonder about the people
[1:31:07] the message argum it see they said well
[1:31:10] look at Paul said God knocked him down
[1:31:12] to make him no no he just knocked him
[1:31:14] off the horse to get his
[1:31:16] attention he knew that's what it take
[1:31:18] what it take to get
[1:31:20] yours
[1:31:24] amen right a man at dille wanted to
[1:31:27] change and be on the night shift because
[1:31:29] his daughter
[1:31:30] was um having problems and things and
[1:31:36] you know invalid style and I changed
[1:31:38] with him for 30
[1:31:40] days and you know what I ran up into a
[1:31:43] fell that you
[1:31:46] know he was looking for some
[1:31:49] answers and then one day I got an
[1:31:51] inspector ction and we wound up later
[1:31:53] getting back together again you know
[1:31:55] well you know I guess that was just an
[1:31:59] accident you
[1:32:01] know I've always told you I'm the baby
[1:32:03] of 13 my daddy was 65 years old when I
[1:32:06] was born my mother was 42 there's 13 of
[1:32:09] us and if you don't believe in
[1:32:11] predestination you got a
[1:32:14] problem I'm just glad they saved the
[1:32:17] best of
[1:32:18] last that's the only thing I can say
[1:32:20] about Dad
[1:32:22] all right but now think
[1:32:26] about God's forn
[1:32:30] knowledge now can he think of
[1:32:35] something can God think of something and
[1:32:38] then change
[1:32:44] that now he can add to his understanding
[1:32:47] we know that as he would reveal it when
[1:32:50] he would show first church a in the
[1:32:52] second Church age third fourth fifth he
[1:32:54] can keep adding to but it's not adding
[1:32:58] to anything it's just unfolding what you
[1:33:02] see amen but can he have a
[1:33:06] thought and then have another thought
[1:33:09] contrary to
[1:33:10] that
[1:33:12] well I I I I was going to
[1:33:16] save Danny Fountain
[1:33:20] but I just decided I didn't want
[1:33:25] to now that's the way we
[1:33:29] think right right but then too you'll
[1:33:33] find out that God doesn't put it on how
[1:33:35] good you are right cuz he doesn't deal
[1:33:38] in that type of
[1:33:41] business ain't none of us nothing but
[1:33:44] garbage canins right that's all we was
[1:33:47] all we'll ever be in human life right
[1:33:50] nothing good about
[1:33:53] us he didn't choose because of something
[1:33:59] good he chose he chose because he knew
[1:34:02] what you'd choose right that's for
[1:34:07] knowledge
[1:34:08] right well what about this great pre
[1:34:11] brother tell that just I want to know
[1:34:13] about this Hang
[1:34:15] on we're going to get down one of these
[1:34:17] days until a question I ask you and I
[1:34:19] don't know how long it'll take but we'll
[1:34:20] get there
[1:34:22] I asked you a question I said how many
[1:34:24] times can you find the soul of God in
[1:34:25] the Old
[1:34:31] Testament you can find a lot of other
[1:34:33] things but can you see it made manifest
[1:34:35] back there well yeah I can see it in it
[1:34:38] I'm not saying that I'm
[1:34:40] saying there wouldn't no children of God
[1:34:43] until the New
[1:34:45] Testament
[1:34:47] okay right they didn't have the Born
[1:34:49] Again experience in the Old Testament no
[1:34:51] way all right so then it might encourage
[1:34:53] you to listen to what I'm saying but if
[1:34:55] we don't get this out of the way when
[1:34:57] you come up to that you'll
[1:35:00] say you know I just don't understand
[1:35:02] because look what's
[1:35:05] happened
[1:35:07] yeah look how brother randam said it one
[1:35:10] day like this he said he had to mix this
[1:35:12] with this and this with this and that
[1:35:13] with this and this with this to get you
[1:35:16] here y that's right you ever noticed
[1:35:19] that quote Amen to get you here that's
[1:35:23] right how do you wind up Mama and
[1:35:26] Daddy's blackheaded Grandma and Grandpa
[1:35:28] on both Sid blackheaded you
[1:35:32] know and you got a blunt-headed
[1:35:34] child I think something went
[1:35:37] wrong we go get your a DNA and find
[1:35:41] out but then you go back through the
[1:35:43] lineage and you find out somewh way back
[1:35:48] there great great great grandma y was
[1:35:52] blune
[1:35:53] headed they come all the way
[1:35:55] down see God knows what he's
[1:35:58] doing don't worry about it and
[1:36:01] everything's right on
[1:36:03] time don't worry about
[1:36:06] it just be on time yourself right and
[1:36:11] and and try to understand what's right
[1:36:13] all right so now he never
[1:36:17] desired anybody to be
[1:36:20] lost
[1:36:24] he want I want to read these because
[1:36:25] people say when I you know you just
[1:36:28] preaching your own
[1:36:29] Doctrine well so we read what number
[1:36:36] six all right let's go over to to number
[1:36:39] seven doesn't look like a seven that's
[1:36:42] what it's supposed to be but any it's
[1:36:43] Harvest Time 1964 12 12 I Chang these
[1:36:46] things so many times until you know I
[1:36:49] have to move my numbers around I want to
[1:36:52] keep you in line all right but what did
[1:36:55] he
[1:36:56] say now he's talking about the word for
[1:36:58] the
[1:36:59] age and he said God scattered his word
[1:37:02] out now we're not going to go into this
[1:37:04] we're still on for
[1:37:06] knowledge okay we're not going to go
[1:37:09] into the word part and all like that
[1:37:11] right now we're going to prove
[1:37:12] predestination by full knowledge right
[1:37:16] okay now he said he's infinite and he
[1:37:20] he's omnipresent in omniscient therefore
[1:37:23] he knows all
[1:37:25] things he can't be present everywhere
[1:37:28] but by be by being omniscient knowing
[1:37:31] all things then he can be present
[1:37:33] everywhere so that goes back to the
[1:37:36] other one what too right because that's
[1:37:38] the way he predestines By Us by for
[1:37:41] knowledge not because he desired that
[1:37:44] this person should be saved and this one
[1:37:46] lost but he knew who who would be lost
[1:37:49] and who would be saved see therefore by
[1:37:51] his for knowledge he can predestinate
[1:37:53] amen and he makes everything work to his
[1:37:56] glory that's what his attributes are
[1:37:58] doing displaying to his displaying to
[1:38:02] his glory one vessel of Honor One Of
[1:38:04] Dishonor but is it God that maketh it
[1:38:08] not him that
[1:38:09] willth or that runneth but God that
[1:38:12] showeth Mercy all right
[1:38:15] now I thought I'd get away on
[1:38:20] over let's go down to the next one where
[1:38:23] Pentecost
[1:38:25] failed not where I think Pentecost
[1:38:27] failed 55
[1:38:29] 1111 now the word is used in here in the
[1:38:31] fifth chapter he talking about in
[1:38:33] Ephesians predestination predestinated
[1:38:36] it's not a very good word for an
[1:38:37] evangelist or a minister to use because
[1:38:39] it kind of confuses people when you say
[1:38:42] predestinate predestination speaks no
[1:38:45] what looks back to for
[1:38:48] knowledge for knowledge looks to Destin
[1:38:53] destination predestination goes back to
[1:38:55] forn knowledge forn knowledge goes to
[1:38:57] destination I got a couple of these but
[1:38:59] I'm not going to get into that okay cuz
[1:39:02] I'm holding the point to try to get you
[1:39:04] to see for knowledge
[1:39:07] right then we'll go back and see it is
[1:39:09] really true in other words God didn't
[1:39:11] say now God didn't say this now I'll
[1:39:14] make this man be this and I'll make this
[1:39:16] man be that but in order to be God he
[1:39:19] had to know the end from the beginning
[1:39:20] so order to forn knowledge that he order
[1:39:23] to forn knowledge that he knew he could
[1:39:26] say this would happen and that would
[1:39:28] happen because he was God and knowed
[1:39:31] where everything would be placed and
[1:39:33] therefore he could ordain certain things
[1:39:35] for certain ages you believe that amen
[1:39:38] that's truly
[1:39:39] scriptural now one of these days we're
[1:39:42] going to get down to a very familiar
[1:39:44] scripture that people don't
[1:39:46] like and that's
[1:39:49] Ephesians you know
[1:39:51] where it says that he gave some Apostles
[1:39:54] and some prophets and evangelists and
[1:39:56] pastors and teachers
[1:39:59] right and brother Brown said he
[1:40:01] predestined
[1:40:03] that yep right see we don't think about
[1:40:07] the fivefold ministry being predestined
[1:40:09] we think of the prophets being
[1:40:13] predestined
[1:40:15] right okay we're going
[1:40:19] somewhere
[1:40:21] see in other words God didn't say now
[1:40:24] I'll make this man be this and I'll make
[1:40:25] this man to be that but in order to be
[1:40:28] God he had to know the end from the
[1:40:29] beginning so in order to forn knowledge
[1:40:31] that he knew he could say this would
[1:40:34] happen and that would happen because he
[1:40:36] was God and know where everything would
[1:40:39] be placed and therefore he could ordain
[1:40:42] certain things for certain ages you
[1:40:44] believe that that's truly scriptural put
[1:40:46] on to the next e19 faith of Abraham 55
[1:40:51] uh
[1:40:52] 11:18 and predestination is a hard word
[1:40:55] among a Congregation of people because
[1:40:57] predestination really forn knowledge is
[1:40:59] a better word and predestination looks
[1:41:02] back to forn knowledge and for knowledge
[1:41:05] looks on to Destiny that God being an
[1:41:08] infinite now he's explaining these
[1:41:11] things in the beginning knew the end
[1:41:13] from the beginning therefore he knew
[1:41:16] what God what people would do so he
[1:41:18] could foretell what would take place for
[1:41:21] he knew what would be therefore he
[1:41:24] before Esau or Jacob either one was born
[1:41:27] God could God could say Esau I've hated
[1:41:31] and Jacob I've Loved because he forew
[1:41:34] what they could be he never made Esau
[1:41:37] the way he was he wasn't willing that
[1:41:39] Esau would be that way but Esau by
[1:41:42] choice God knew what would take what new
[1:41:47] would take that
[1:41:48] way so that's how he knows knows us
[1:41:51] today he knows your heart and if you
[1:41:54] might be able to fool your neighbor you
[1:41:56] might be able to fool your pastor but
[1:41:58] you'll never be able to fool God cuz he
[1:42:00] knows your heart all right but now we'll
[1:42:03] get back to that where he's talking
[1:42:06] about
[1:42:07] predestination looking back to forn
[1:42:10] knowledge for knowledge looking to
[1:42:12] Destin Destiny we'll get back to that so
[1:42:14] don't get tied up in it now just stay
[1:42:16] with me on what I'm trying to prove I'm
[1:42:17] trying to prove to one point what
[1:42:21] God's covenant with Abraham
[1:42:24] 56-23 he said now Jesus didn't come to
[1:42:27] Calvary just for a halfhazard
[1:42:30] thought amen are you reading y see now
[1:42:35] this is what my brother says my brother
[1:42:37] says that he believes that certain
[1:42:39] places that there were certain prophets
[1:42:41] certain people Jesus being pre-ordained
[1:42:44] to be here he said he believed it that
[1:42:46] way but everything else was just on any
[1:42:48] other point but see he believes that
[1:42:53] Jesus come and says well you know God
[1:42:55] sent down you know have the denomination
[1:42:56] TR God sent down his
[1:42:59] son you know to where that he could die
[1:43:03] that maybe some people would feel sorry
[1:43:05] for him and get
[1:43:07] saved now that's what he's a pres he's a
[1:43:10] Methodist Theologian and that's
[1:43:12] evidently probably what they taught him
[1:43:14] in college see that he just does it
[1:43:18] hophazardly well listen to your prophet
[1:43:21] now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just
[1:43:22] for a h Hazard thought well I'll die up
[1:43:25] there perhaps maybe some somebody will
[1:43:28] feel sorry for me and come down and get
[1:43:33] saved so no no God don't run his office
[1:43:36] like that you don't run your office like
[1:43:38] that Jesus come for one specific purpose
[1:43:41] that was to redeem those that God fornew
[1:43:45] right would be redeemed see now God's
[1:43:48] not willing that any should perish but
[1:43:51] that all would come to repentance but in
[1:43:53] order to be God he had to know now the
[1:43:56] word predestinate as is used in
[1:43:59] Ephesians 1:5 predestinate there isn't a
[1:44:02] good word it means in speaking of
[1:44:05] predestination to the people sometimes
[1:44:07] leads them to think that God just
[1:44:09] predestinated you to push you through a
[1:44:12] little pipe or something that's not
[1:44:14] right predestination looks back to forn
[1:44:17] knowledge and forn knowledge looks to
[1:44:18] Destiny I said I won't try to Express
[1:44:21] that point but I will say this
[1:44:23] much you do have something to do with
[1:44:25] your predestination that quote just
[1:44:27] proves it amen cuz God don't put you in
[1:44:30] a pot and push you through the other
[1:44:34] end all right we'll come back to that
[1:44:36] quote later but he don't do that he
[1:44:38] don't put you in there and just push you
[1:44:40] to that's the way it's got to
[1:44:43] be
[1:44:44] no you got a
[1:44:47] choice why would it be say said to
[1:44:50] Brother
[1:44:51] brandham by the U was it the tongues and
[1:44:55] interpretation of Danny Henry which one
[1:44:56] was it because of the choice that you
[1:44:58] have made a great portion of Heaven
[1:45:00] awaits you that's it what a choice that
[1:45:02] he
[1:45:04] make right brother Adam is not one to
[1:45:08] bypass anything he's going to be just
[1:45:09] like you and I he's going to be judged
[1:45:11] according to his desires
[1:45:14] right and if he didn't correct those
[1:45:16] things he's got a problem
[1:45:19] right I trouble saying those things
[1:45:21] because that's the way all human beings
[1:45:24] are we're all going to give an account
[1:45:27] right of the reason why we had that idea
[1:45:31] well I just don't like brother
[1:45:33] Dale course that's what all of you say
[1:45:35] when you come here you say well we was
[1:45:37] all talk you know sister was saying it
[1:45:39] last night you know we was we know we in
[1:45:41] other words you heard so much about
[1:45:42] brother Dale you you you thought he was
[1:45:44] so messed up till you just didn't want
[1:45:45] to fool with him well you know people's
[1:45:47] going to have to give an account for
[1:45:48] that one day amen that's right I mean
[1:45:50] they'll have to answer that point but
[1:45:52] that's their business that ain't mine I
[1:45:54] still love them I still fellowship with
[1:45:57] them you know and I don't have no
[1:45:59] problems
[1:46:01] why cuz I'm I want Christ to be made
[1:46:05] manifest not Samuel Dale or some
[1:46:07] Doctrine
[1:46:09] right the church has got to have a
[1:46:11] Doctrine sure but you don't have to put
[1:46:13] it in the wrong way right and
[1:46:18] listen he said he didn't God do it that
[1:46:21] way so here's another one God keeps his
[1:46:22] word
[1:46:23] 5747 and Jesus never come to Earth just
[1:46:26] to say I'll have preachers go out and
[1:46:28] preach some tell them about what I done
[1:46:32] and maybe somebody will feel sorry for
[1:46:34] me and get saved God don't run his
[1:46:36] office like that there God at the
[1:46:39] beginning
[1:46:40] know exactly who would be saved Jesus
[1:46:43] come to save those that God knew would
[1:46:46] be saved he wasn't willing that they'd
[1:46:49] be lost but but to be God he knowed who
[1:46:51] would be lost and who would be saved
[1:46:53] therefore he could
[1:46:55] predestinate not predestinate this he he
[1:46:58] he for by for knowledge he could set in
[1:47:02] order to make everything work to his
[1:47:04] glory because that's now I like this one
[1:47:08] now the devil isn't omnipresent nor
[1:47:12] omnipotent neither does he know the end
[1:47:14] from the
[1:47:16] beginning see we give the devil credit
[1:47:18] of knowing a lot of things and I do too
[1:47:19] a lot of times about it but you know
[1:47:21] come find out he doesn't know as much as
[1:47:23] we think he knows that's right see all
[1:47:26] right
[1:47:27] amen God Only God Alone knows it he
[1:47:31] doesn't know the end from the beginning
[1:47:34] God Alone knows it you know what we do
[1:47:35] that's why brother brother said if I
[1:47:36] keep something within my heart and don't
[1:47:38] tell nobody about it he said devil can't
[1:47:40] bother
[1:47:41] me but he said if I go tell somebody he
[1:47:43] said devil will beat me there that's
[1:47:45] right in another words cuz he know
[1:47:47] something fixing to happen right now I
[1:47:49] I've always like liked it like this I
[1:47:51] believe that he knows when that angel
[1:47:53] that's with you I believe he knows about
[1:47:56] him all about everything and your own
[1:47:57] personal angel that when he's coming
[1:48:00] towards you and something's being done
[1:48:02] Satan will automatically try to hinder
[1:48:04] that so that's why sometimes he makes us
[1:48:07] sick sometimes he makes us of problems
[1:48:10] and all and I don't glory in sicknesses
[1:48:13] but if we take our sickness in the right
[1:48:15] direction and let it be for God's honor
[1:48:18] and glory to be healed not honor and
[1:48:21] glory to be sick honor and glory to be
[1:48:24] healed delivered as a witness then it's
[1:48:27] a wonderful thing to be sick
[1:48:31] right but we look at it as a you know as
[1:48:35] a problem and I do too first thing
[1:48:38] happens when I get sick what did I say
[1:48:40] what did I do wrong I'm a human I'm just
[1:48:42] like you I said Lord what did I do wrong
[1:48:45] all I'm doing is studying your word
[1:48:47] trying my best to preach and screaming
[1:48:49] and the people and and here I am telling
[1:48:54] them about healing and you you letting
[1:48:56] me be
[1:48:57] sick
[1:48:59] well we don't have nothing to do with
[1:49:01] that right but we got something to do
[1:49:03] with believing right right if we believe
[1:49:07] it God can release it all
[1:49:10] right
[1:49:13] okay five Junctions of time
[1:49:16] 56 122 did you ever read over there in
[1:49:20] Romans 9 how did he said before either
[1:49:22] boy was born Esau and Jacob said I hate
[1:49:24] one and love the other how can he be
[1:49:27] just and do
[1:49:29] that now that around is asking you a
[1:49:32] simple question how can God be just
[1:49:36] and condemn
[1:49:38] Esau and love
[1:49:44] Jacob he's asking you a simple question
[1:49:46] do you know him I hate one I love the
[1:49:49] other how can he be just and do that by
[1:49:53] for knowledge he knew what a rascal Esau
[1:49:56] was see and he could
[1:49:59] predestinate not just say say that the
[1:50:03] word predestinate is not a good word to
[1:50:05] use it's for knowledge because he
[1:50:08] wouldn't just
[1:50:10] listen at deliberately turn you
[1:50:15] away can't you see him dealing with
[1:50:17] Judas when his for knowledge to let him
[1:50:20] know exactly what Judas would wind up
[1:50:23] being can't you see his for knowledge
[1:50:25] and he would know exactly what Cain
[1:50:27] would do but yet he's still dealing with
[1:50:30] Cain and saying if you'd have made the
[1:50:32] right choice like your brother even if
[1:50:34] you'd go do right
[1:50:37] now that's why we blame Judas and we say
[1:50:39] Judas was this that of the other well
[1:50:41] what are we right he said all Judas was
[1:50:43] just a rascal Peter was worse Rascal cuz
[1:50:46] Judas never did deny Jesus he told him
[1:50:49] who he was
[1:50:50] right he led him to him right
[1:50:55] right Peter was one tonight even cing
[1:50:58] doing
[1:51:00] it yeah we want to make one so great
[1:51:04] yeah
[1:51:05] okay but
[1:51:07] listen just that deliberately turn you
[1:51:10] away because it's because you have there
[1:51:13] another words in other words you've done
[1:51:14] something you you know he wants you in
[1:51:17] other words just listen you you you got
[1:51:20] to read brother Brandon but you got to
[1:51:21] know what he's saying go read that next
[1:51:24] part you're saying right there just read
[1:51:25] it without understanding because because
[1:51:28] you have he wants you to go away yeah
[1:51:32] right now that's not what brother around
[1:51:34] and say well what do you mean I word for
[1:51:37] word yeah yeah but that's know what he's
[1:51:39] saying
[1:51:41] right he's not saying he wants you to
[1:51:44] go he's telling you because because you
[1:51:46] have other
[1:51:48] words he don't want you to go away he
[1:51:52] wants you saved that's right amen but we
[1:51:55] think he wants us to go
[1:51:59] away Satan's the one who wants us to go
[1:52:01] away he's not willing that any of you
[1:52:03] should perish but by full knowledge he
[1:52:05] know that they'll do even before you
[1:52:08] that what you'll do even before you come
[1:52:10] on Earth sure for knowledge okay I got
[1:52:12] to read fast let
[1:52:15] me Christ The Mystery of God reveal 63
[1:52:18] 7:28 God never just said I'll choose
[1:52:22] this one and I'll choose that one but he
[1:52:24] knew by his reason he could predestinate
[1:52:27] is because he's infinite and he he knows
[1:52:30] he's infinite so therefore he know
[1:52:32] everything he know the end he could tell
[1:52:34] the end from the beginning he's God If
[1:52:37] he if he can't do that he's not God now
[1:52:40] that's plain as could be around blunt I
[1:52:43] like to be that away but listen I don't
[1:52:46] have time to read all the rest of these
[1:52:48] but you read the rest of them all right
[1:52:50] me fast run it through in case people
[1:52:52] miss it well you just go ahead we'll get
[1:52:55] back to these and I'll bring them and
[1:52:56] we'll reread them for knowledge brother
[1:52:59] brandom says Jehovah Gyra 581 127 first
[1:53:03] forn knowledge allows him to
[1:53:05] predestinate all things to work to his
[1:53:08] glory you see what I'm talking about now
[1:53:10] what is how does God predestinate by his
[1:53:13] for
[1:53:15] knowled well brother D I thought it was
[1:53:17] all this seed that was in us and all all
[1:53:19] of these things like that see that's
[1:53:22] where your thinking is messed
[1:53:25] up he doesn't predestinate according to
[1:53:28] his
[1:53:30] desires cuz if he does the thing formed
[1:53:32] could say you made me this way and you
[1:53:35] can't judge me my brother says that he
[1:53:38] said God made me a sinner and he cannot
[1:53:40] condemn me for being a sinner I said
[1:53:42] you're wrong you made yourself a sinner
[1:53:46] God did not make you one right you made
[1:53:49] a choice We were put in the pawn shop oh
[1:53:51] that look like God told us in the pawn
[1:53:53] shop we put oursel in the pawn shop we
[1:53:55] had a choice when we come to the free
[1:53:57] moral agency we could have accepted
[1:54:00] Jesus Christ or rejected him we could
[1:54:03] have went on but instead we rejected him
[1:54:05] we went out into the world we put oursel
[1:54:07] in the pawn shop we put oursel in the
[1:54:10] Devil's
[1:54:11] Hole and then blame God for putting us
[1:54:13] there sure God knew by four knowledge
[1:54:16] that we would go there right right and
[1:54:18] he would do whatever he could would I
[1:54:20] can stand here and talk all this
[1:54:22] afternoon where down through my life
[1:54:23] I've told you about I go out and do
[1:54:25] wrong and and I'd come back home and cry
[1:54:27] about it Butz I didn't want to do it but
[1:54:30] yet I was a human mortal and in my body
[1:54:32] I wanted to do
[1:54:34] things but even as a lost and I was
[1:54:37] totally lost but yet still I had a
[1:54:40] recognition of a
[1:54:44] god see brother Brown explains it like
[1:54:47] this and you'll see where I'm going he's
[1:54:48] talking about Moses BN born with this
[1:54:50] great
[1:54:52] gift oh we can look at that in really
[1:54:54] Glory can't we do you know what he said
[1:54:57] he said every person in the world was
[1:54:59] born with that
[1:55:04] gift so whatever you give Moses give it
[1:55:07] to
[1:55:08] everybody or whatever you give to
[1:55:10] everybody give it to Moses right you got
[1:55:13] to understand what's going on but how
[1:55:16] does God predestinate by his for
[1:55:18] knowledge
[1:55:20] he could look down through time before
[1:55:22] the world ever begun and he could see
[1:55:26] everything that we would do every
[1:55:27] thought you and I would have here
[1:55:29] today God knew that before the
[1:55:32] world but you know what he didn't make
[1:55:34] you think
[1:55:38] it he didn't make you think that the
[1:55:40] devil makes you think a lot of things
[1:55:42] but God Don't Make Us
[1:55:46] thing God gives us a
[1:55:48] choice
[1:55:50] we can accept him or we can reject him
[1:55:53] that's right and by his forn knowledge
[1:55:55] he knew what it would
[1:55:57] be well I thought predes you know there
[1:56:00] great big mystery of of a seed and you
[1:56:03] can't understand a seed until you know
[1:56:05] what a seed is right what kind of seed
[1:56:08] you talking about right come on brother
[1:56:11] that's right what kind of a seed you
[1:56:13] talking about beans potatoes
[1:56:17] corn well I was born BL god with this
[1:56:20] seed in me then it was in there by for
[1:56:22] knowledge
[1:56:26] y
[1:56:28] amen amen right we've got read on those
[1:56:32] quotes I'll bring them back when I
[1:56:34] preach Wednesday bring the you know
[1:56:35] again just bring you quotes there we
[1:56:37] play the tape this afternoon but
[1:56:39] Wednesday we'll get brother Brown says
[1:56:41] you're saved by
[1:56:43] predestination
[1:56:46] amen I thought I saved by grace through
[1:56:49] faith that's what predestination is
[1:56:51] Grace through faith amen amen see it's
[1:56:55] all right when we get it
[1:56:58] together but see that way the thing form
[1:57:01] can't
[1:57:02] say God you didn't give me a
[1:57:06] choice you see where the condemnation is
[1:57:08] going to be though because you and I
[1:57:10] have heard this message and we have
[1:57:13] heard the prophet explain it and the
[1:57:16] it'll be a condemnation upon us because
[1:57:20] we have no rights whatsoever here in
[1:57:22] Lula to argue the point of whether or
[1:57:25] not I well I don't know whether I was a
[1:57:27] seed or whether I wasn't a seed or I
[1:57:30] just can't figure this out we've been
[1:57:32] over this for 40
[1:57:34] years right sure we still have things
[1:57:38] that we wonder about but for 40 years
[1:57:41] we've been through these things how many
[1:57:43] times how many series have I preached on
[1:57:46] predestination that's
[1:57:48] right brother raay pulling them down and
[1:57:50] putting them fixing some of them now
