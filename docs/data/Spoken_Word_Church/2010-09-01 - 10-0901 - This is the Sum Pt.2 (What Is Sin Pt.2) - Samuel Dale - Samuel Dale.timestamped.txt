[30:42] name amen and
[30:44] amen now remember we'll get to it in a
[30:47] minute to say that but I want to make
[30:50] sure to cover this each time Paul after
[30:54] summing up seven
[30:56] chapters finishing the seventh chapter
[31:00] speaking of the great
[31:02] mdic you know and bringing out the
[31:04] things that was never understood by
[31:07] mankind you know even till uh you know
[31:12] probably a lot of the disciples brother
[31:14] brandom said that Paul understood
[31:16] Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new now
[31:19] what do the others understand Jehovah
[31:20] the old was Jesus of the new but they
[31:21] didn't understand it in the language or
[31:24] the depth or height or understanding
[31:26] that Paul had all right now but after he
[31:30] gets through with seven chapters verse
[31:33] one says now of the things which we have
[31:37] spoken listen this is the
[31:40] S now here is the Su cuz that's what
[31:42] we're talking about this is the son what
[31:45] is the son we have such an high priest
[31:47] who is set on the right hand of the
[31:49] Throne of the Majesty in the heavens all
[31:53] right so now he says after he got
[31:55] through what he was to saying there
[31:57] here's the some of
[31:59] it other words what all he's brought to
[32:01] a p to pass
[32:04] Ecclesiastes 12 is after he gets through
[32:08] with the great Ecclesiastes the preacher
[32:11] you know after he gets through preaching
[32:13] his sermon and bringing everything down
[32:15] he gets down to uh verse 13 of the 12th
[32:21] chapter and he says let us hear the
[32:24] conclusion of the whole matter in other
[32:27] words what I've said to you throughout
[32:29] all of this
[32:31] Ecclesiastes now here is the
[32:35] conclusion what is it fear God and keep
[32:39] his Commandments for this is the whole
[32:41] duty of man you may be seated the Lord
[32:44] at his Blessing to the reading of the
[32:48] word now I don't generally do this but
[32:53] it was asked about it so I won't put the
[32:55] names or anything to it but when the
[32:58] person receives the tape they'll
[33:00] understand it Wade done a marvelous job
[33:03] covering the other day about uh there in
[33:06] Genesis where that it was talking about
[33:10] uh you
[33:11] know and let God said let there be
[33:14] light all right and uh then you go on
[33:19] over
[33:21] later you know and you got even the
[33:23] dividing of day and night there that
[33:26] part and then you go on over and the Sun
[33:28] and the Moon is created all right and
[33:31] see that seems to be something uh
[33:34] contrary but as Wade was bringing out
[33:38] and we'll get the other but even um
[33:43] Einstein when they were asking the
[33:45] question or teaching that in school he
[33:49] proved to them that actually darkness is
[33:53] not a creation
[33:56] right it's an
[33:58] absence of light amen that's right all
[34:02] right now darkness is not a creation
[34:04] right it's an absence of light so you
[34:07] can take a room that is so
[34:10] dark you cannot make that room dark
[34:13] enough to put out one small minute
[34:17] candle that's right right amen see
[34:20] darkness is not a creation then it's an
[34:24] absence that's of light all right but
[34:28] see you could take one little candle and
[34:29] no matter I mean you could keep burying
[34:32] burying I think about those uh guys down
[34:34] in the uh M out there you know that's
[34:36] been buried for so many days and what if
[34:39] every one of them light went out how
[34:42] dark would it be down in
[34:45] that you know so many thousands of feet
[34:49] down in the earth we were in a cave one
[34:51] time with Josh with the um ra boys here
[34:55] or not uh Boy Scout Boy Scouts years ago
[34:58] and and I knew that God was going to do
[35:00] something so he made us all turn off our
[35:03] our uh little lights we had and we were
[35:06] way down underground and uh probably I
[35:09] don't know 7 or 800 ft at least cuz we
[35:11] had to go down and
[35:14] anyhow so in a minute he cut off his
[35:18] light well it was so dark in
[35:20] there to Bud you could feel how dark it
[35:25] was you know but in a minute he told a
[35:28] story of course he meant for to do that
[35:29] and he scared us all by not the story as
[35:32] much but immediately had a light that to
[35:35] go like that and that room was just all
[35:38] just totally lit up all at one time you
[35:40] know it wasn't have slow gradual but you
[35:42] know it's dark my point is what I'm
[35:45] saying that you can't not you cannot
[35:48] create a Darkness to put out light right
[35:51] right so darkness is not a creation so
[35:54] when it says there let there be light
[35:58] you know all right and the light
[36:01] appeared now Scofield says that the way
[36:05] brought it out the meaning there is
[36:08] basically that the light
[36:11] appeared all right and I was just
[36:14] thinking about it a minute ago and I
[36:16] thought you know well we could put it on
[36:17] here and then the person can get it and
[36:19] it won't be answering questions it'll
[36:21] just be a statement
[36:23] truth suppose back there you were
[36:25] standing with God Now everywhere he's
[36:28] ever been is light amen would you
[36:32] agree see the Bible says in him is no
[36:35] Darkness all right now there's no
[36:38] darkness in God all right that's right
[36:40] now he didn't have to create a light to
[36:42] make a light for it to be light see he
[36:46] was he was light amen all right but now
[36:50] out way from him would have been
[36:56] what so we need created the angels and
[36:59] the angels was around him I don't know
[37:01] how close I'm just making a
[37:04] point but so far out was light right
[37:08] those angels could worship him cuz they
[37:11] were not in darkness they were in light
[37:14] all right but then he said let there be
[37:17] light in other words bring light into
[37:19] the whole
[37:22] universe so he lit up the whole universe
[37:25] with his presence that's it amen
[37:28] right and then later he created the moon
[37:30] and and the star right see to control
[37:34] with but see in his presence is
[37:38] light all right
[37:41] now see like I said
[37:43] now light was just
[37:47] appeared it just appeared out there the
[37:50] question the person asked was was that
[37:54] Darkness was that Satan because of his
[37:56] fall
[37:58] you know you know I know he's the the
[38:00] god of the darkness I know all of that
[38:02] that's but still remember darkness is
[38:05] not a creation right and see Satan
[38:08] couldn't create Darkness amen you take
[38:11] and shut this room down as dark as could
[38:13] be but you take one little light and
[38:15] turn it
[38:16] on it expels all of that
[38:20] Darkness cuz there not it's not
[38:23] something it's not something that exists
[38:25] it's an absence right
[38:28] so then you just think about it when he
[38:30] said uh you know let there be
[38:33] light in other words let my existence
[38:36] move out far enough into the
[38:39] universe amen that there would be light
[38:42] amen then in his creation of the moon
[38:46] and the stars and the things like that
[38:48] you know the sun would be on over
[38:51] later as you know a a creation but just
[38:55] remember it's absence of light amen is
[38:57] what darkness really is
[39:00] okay maybe we found a way
[39:02] to answer questions we without answering
[39:05] them I get tickled sometimes I'm
[39:08] smart I'm such a dummy that I'm dummy
[39:11] but sometimes I think of good things all
[39:14] right now let's get into the point as I
[39:17] said and tried to cover there our Sunday
[39:20] morning
[39:22] that Paul in all of what he
[39:26] said of bringing it down to seeing Mel
[39:30] chdc and saying I things that I can't
[39:33] talk to you about you know right and
[39:36] then he says now here's the sum of
[39:41] this all right so what did he say now
[39:44] the sum of it was what what was the sum
[39:47] of all he had
[39:50] said what was
[39:52] it we have such an high priest who is
[39:56] set on the right hand of the Throne of
[39:59] the Majesty in the
[40:02] heavens now that's a great
[40:05] thing right see then Ecclesiastes he's
[40:08] bringing it up and he's summing up
[40:10] everything he said and concluding it
[40:12] right and he's saying
[40:15] what fear God and keep his Commandments
[40:19] for this is the whole duty of man all
[40:21] right now then I told you we would be
[40:24] reading these two and talking of the
[40:27] these things first I don't know how long
[40:30] because uh it's just a thought to put a
[40:33] a title and then we'll have a subtitle
[40:36] and so I
[40:38] said in the Bible and in the prophet's
[40:41] message and things and you know
[40:44] everybody said oh the prophet's message
[40:45] it's a Bible it's I I see the Bible and
[40:48] I see the prophet's message as an
[40:52] expounding uh understanding to be given
[40:55] to us that you can call all the Bible
[40:58] but it's not the Bible you know it's not
[41:00] we don't take the books and say we got
[41:03] two Bibles yeah Bible of the prophet and
[41:06] Bible of the Bible no no no that's
[41:09] that's not exactly my understanding I I
[41:12] I look at it like that the prophet was
[41:15] sent to give us the
[41:17] interpretation of the word of God all
[41:19] right and in doing that then if we
[41:22] consult the Bible and we consult the
[41:26] prophet
[41:27] then we've got to be close somewhere to
[41:31] understanding all right then but at then
[41:34] at that point it is still not Revelation
[41:37] just because we can bring together the
[41:40] two
[41:42] things see Paul was after he had spent a
[41:46] lot of time in bringing the Revelation
[41:48] then he says now here's the sum of
[41:50] it you know the sum of what he was
[41:54] saying we have a great high priest see
[41:56] that was a Revelation to him not a an
[41:58] intellectual conception that's right see
[42:02] an intellectual conception is wonderful
[42:04] CU we must have those before God can
[42:06] reveal anything to us but just remember
[42:09] because you can take this and put it
[42:12] together with this and come over and
[42:13] talk about it doesn't mean that it's
[42:16] necessarily a revelation right all right
[42:20] and it will show up after a
[42:22] while it may take quite a while but
[42:25] it'll show up and that's the way you
[42:28] check things you just give a man a
[42:30] change let him you know what was brother
[42:32] R said that that his mama said just give
[42:34] a cow enough rope she'll hang herself
[42:37] well that's what you do with people
[42:39] right you just give them enough rope and
[42:42] let them hang
[42:43] theel especially with preachers cuz
[42:46] after a while they will tie a knot and
[42:47] hang their own self you don't have to
[42:50] worry about it cuz at a while you'll see
[42:53] them you know and they'll start well
[42:55] brother brandham was wrong
[42:58] M well we
[43:00] know and you know Jesus was even
[43:03] wrong see now you done hung yourself
[43:06] right
[43:07] amen cuz you haven't let the thing come
[43:10] together as a conclusion right you
[43:13] haven't summed it up in a way to bring
[43:16] forth what is supposed to be brought
[43:18] right all right now I I I don't want to
[43:22] keep repea but I will repeat a lot of
[43:24] this in each one of the services because
[43:26] that's what I believe
[43:28] I believe the things brother brandom
[43:29] said sometimes are they do look contrary
[43:32] one to the other I I mean I agree you
[43:35] know like I said you give me any topic
[43:37] that you want to name a topic and I can
[43:41] by memory bring a quote from Brother
[43:43] random out of text of what he said and
[43:46] show you either
[43:47] side well that's been argued all the way
[43:50] down through time you know be therefore
[43:53] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[43:55] perfect none good know not one now both
[43:59] quoting
[44:01] scriptures but I believe both of them
[44:03] are right
[44:07] amen I believe both of them are right
[44:10] amen but it's got to be brought
[44:14] together to see the conclusion of the
[44:17] matter and then we would be able to
[44:19] understand and brother brandham he'll
[44:21] bring out things and then you know seem
[44:23] like here he'll bring out something and
[44:25] here he'll bring out something now I
[44:27] believe in progressive revelation amen
[44:30] right I told you that I believe brother
[44:32] brandom had to grow in Grace and
[44:34] knowledge I believe that because you
[44:37] know that would be true and he would say
[44:39] something here and he'd grow in Grace
[44:41] and
[44:42] knowledge but be careful because what he
[44:45] said was under the eyes of a
[44:48] prophet back when he said that and then
[44:51] when it would
[44:52] unfold that's my point I want you to see
[44:56] that I believe everything thing in the
[44:57] Bible the prophet's message and all goes
[44:59] from a partial realization of something
[45:03] you know beginning to see it to a
[45:05] perfect realization and is not that the
[45:08] way that we we are um you know we we get
[45:12] in our car and we say how much
[45:14] horsepower you to
[45:16] have well I got a 300 horsepower engine
[45:20] well you
[45:22] know you know why they call it
[45:24] horsepower it's rated according to much
[45:27] pull is there that's I mean that's I
[45:29] know it's carnal but it still pushes it
[45:32] down the road right I've always tried to
[45:34] tell you that the MU pushed the plow he
[45:36] didn't pull it but you won't believe it
[45:37] anyway
[45:38] so but see that
[45:42] car and all the way it's set up is to
[45:45] push that object right well then they
[45:47] just put more horsepower in it pushes a
[45:49] rocket pushes an airplane P it's just
[45:51] more horsepower because it comes from
[45:53] the fact of what one horse down here
[45:55] with one wagon
[45:58] and and doing that see I better say
[46:02] something cuz people think I sure am
[46:03] dumb but you better remember that when
[46:05] you put the gears on the horse the horse
[46:08] pushes the collar the collar pushes the
[46:10] gears the gears are hooked to the chain
[46:12] back to pull the wagon so it is pushing
[46:15] the
[46:16] wagon somebody hear that and they say
[46:18] are you stupid well that's all right I
[46:20] PL enough or know but listen to what I'm
[46:24] trying to say
[46:27] I believe
[46:29] everything unless it was something
[46:31] brother R said he was wrong
[46:34] about now when he said he was wrong amen
[46:38] we take the correction right
[46:41] right you know white horse
[46:45] rider on the things that he said when he
[46:48] said he was wrong we take the
[46:50] correction but if he didn't say it was
[46:53] wrong we better watch us trying to
[46:55] correct it right amen because we're not
[46:58] the prophet see that's right you
[47:02] know God gave a man a message and if he
[47:05] can't keep it straight what kind of a
[47:08] god do we have that's right you know I
[47:11] mean but now sometimes it looks so
[47:13] contrary one to the other but you'll
[47:15] find a wonderful Revelation a lot of
[47:17] time lays within the fact that you see
[47:19] two things looking totally contrary but
[47:21] after a while you see them come together
[47:23] they're so perfect right and you'll find
[47:26] out that was right here and he was right
[47:30] here so it goes from partial to perfect
[47:33] realization all right now so we're going
[47:35] to be taking some
[47:36] things uh like
[47:39] righteousness you know just some some
[47:41] topics and just going from the smallest
[47:45] that we can find of what the prophet
[47:47] would say about something to bring it up
[47:49] to you know the perfect realization of
[47:52] the day you remember how we gave it
[47:54] there Sunday that that uh brother
[47:57] Brandon was saying on glorified Jesus
[47:59] he's covered he said now when you get
[48:02] born again the Bible becomes a new book
[48:06] amen
[48:10] right I got this L here for you if you
[48:12] want to read
[48:13] it that was in
[48:15] 1955
[48:17] 225 then comes along a little bit later
[48:20] in contending for the faith and he said
[48:23] you can't right understand the Bible
[48:25] until you go over and see some of the
[48:29] Eastern Customs right I know he didn't
[48:33] never go to Israel but he went close
[48:34] enough to understand the Customs he went
[48:36] close enough to see the Sheep he went
[48:38] close enough to see the donkeys he went
[48:40] close enough to see the campal all right
[48:42] but he says you can't understand the B
[48:44] he said because under the Eastern
[48:46] understanding it becomes a new book
[48:50] right
[48:52] well and we know those are
[48:55] true see but then he comes along in 64
[48:58] on uh God's power to transform and he
[49:01] says after the opening of The Seven
[49:03] Seals the Bible become a brand new book
[49:07] right now he didn't change did he right
[49:12] cuz you got to have the new birth get
[49:14] any understanding other than
[49:16] intellect and it really helps to see
[49:19] because we went there and saw as I told
[49:21] you in the Bible we read of a fig tree
[49:24] and we look around here and we see a
[49:26] bush it's never never know more than you
[49:28] know at the most 18 20 no more than 18
[49:31] or 15 ft high and it's just a bush just
[49:34] all kind of Limbs going Every Which Way
[49:35] growing up from the ground but over
[49:36] there it's a tree right big tree 30 40
[49:40] foot high thig
[49:42] tree so then we can understand but that
[49:46] was what I wanted you to
[49:47] see see getting those things and
[49:50] comparing what the prophet has said in
[49:54] his early Ministry
[49:56] now see a lot of people today say
[49:58] brother Brown changed about the New
[49:59] Birth well now we'll get to that I can
[50:01] show you where brother brownon said that
[50:03] I Tau three processes from the beginning
[50:05] and hadn't changed since amen that's
[50:08] right soever what he Tau was three
[50:12] processes every what you think he taught
[50:14] was three processes
[50:17] right see now that way the message is
[50:20] Will unfold so the will the
[50:24] Bible see then we can understand why
[50:27] things are said cuzz it needed to be
[50:29] said that there's none good no not
[50:32] one right cuz I agree with that 100%
[50:35] amen
[50:37] right but see then it needs to be said
[50:39] that we're perfect right amen I agree
[50:42] with that well how can you be no good
[50:45] and perfect well may but one way and
[50:47] that's in God Amen all right but see
[50:50] then we went down now to try not to
[50:52] spend much time but we went into the
[50:55] topic of what is
[50:59] sin and brother R
[51:02] said that there's no other sin but
[51:06] unbelief that was the invisible
[51:10] Union page
[51:12] 38 E36 or the Inner Man 531 1212 there's
[51:18] no other sin but
[51:23] unbelief all right then the Bible says
[51:26] in John 3:18 he that believeth not is
[51:29] condemned
[51:31] already okay and Hebrews 10:26 says if
[51:36] we sin willfully after receiving the
[51:38] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[51:39] no more
[51:41] sacrifice you know all that's right
[51:44] right
[51:45] amen
[51:47] okay but then we ask the
[51:50] question there is no sin but
[51:53] unbelief we asked brother brandham the
[51:55] question
[51:57] and took his
[51:59] answer brother brandom do we ask
[52:02] Christians do we
[52:05] sin he said Christian is the only one
[52:08] that they sin right cuz the sinner is
[52:11] condemned on a higher level right that's
[52:14] positioned in Christ 196
[52:16] 522 you know paragraph 58 also in the
[52:20] same message and position in Christ he's
[52:22] talking about he said why it is each day
[52:25] we make mistakes each day we do wrong
[52:28] but if you're a born again man or woman
[52:30] as soon as you make the mistake God
[52:32] knows you're sorry for it you can't you
[52:34] can stand in the presence of President
[52:37] Roosevelt or anybody else and say God
[52:38] I'm wrong all right do you notice that
[52:41] it says s i ns a sinner is a sinner he
[52:46] does not commit sins but the church
[52:49] commits
[52:50] sins sin excuse me sin Singler does
[52:54] wrong gets a wrong thought wrong
[52:56] impression make Scruples wobbles like a
[53:00] little child walking trying to learn how
[53:02] to
[53:05] walk
[53:07] now so only Christians can sin because a
[53:10] sinner he just condemned as a sinner
[53:13] that's right he's not going to hell
[53:15] because he drinks and smokes and gamble
[53:17] see that's what we've all been taught
[53:19] all of our life in other words you say
[53:20] what is sin sin is always the thing you
[53:24] want to use against somebody else
[53:28] that's right you smoke you'll take the
[53:31] whole category of sin drank and gambling
[53:34] running around with women but you'll
[53:35] never mention that
[53:39] smoking all right but if you drink you
[53:42] won't mention
[53:44] that right so it's according what you
[53:47] want to gauge other people with but now
[53:49] the point I want you to
[53:52] get brother R says you sin every day and
[53:54] he said yes sir that's right paragraph
[53:57] 209 Hebrews chapter 6 all
[54:01] right do we sin all of us sin there is
[54:06] none without
[54:09] sin E6 contended for the faith
[54:12] 56 20 that what it is 2 20 I think every
[54:17] day you sin Paul said I covered his
[54:20] heart the other day he said I have to
[54:22] Die
[54:23] daily amen
[54:27] you said but now now brother Dale
[54:31] uh then are we all
[54:38] unbelievers
[54:40] now get the point of what we're talking
[54:42] about cuz I want to try to sum up this
[54:45] more than I did uh Sunday CU I just run
[54:48] up and run out of
[54:52] time then what is
[54:55] sin there's a only one
[54:57] sin and that's
[54:59] unbelief that's
[55:02] right
[55:05] now but was brother brandom an
[55:09] unbeliever when he said he sinned every
[55:12] day was Paul an unbeliever when he was a
[55:15] saying
[55:16] that he died daily that's a simple
[55:18] question to ask
[55:21] you when they said they did
[55:25] Sin now what about it what is your
[55:28] conclusion to the matter
[55:31] amen what are you going to sum it all up
[55:34] with and bring out a
[55:36] statement from those
[55:39] things where are you going and what are
[55:41] you going to
[55:44] do turn over and we'll read and then
[55:46] just stay there and we'll read a little
[55:48] bit more read look over in John and
[55:50] let's read Little John
[55:52] now first
[55:54] John you know the Little John over next
[55:57] to the Book of
[56:02] Revelation you say well let's just sin
[56:05] and then we try to explain
[56:07] now you hear a little bit of it now but
[56:11] I know it was used in the Presbyterian I
[56:13] talked brother Dick and him about it cuz
[56:14] they used to say things and and I know
[56:17] it wasn't the
[56:18] Baptist and people had what they call
[56:21] the sin of what was it omission and
[56:23] commission is that how the two words
[56:26] right and the definition of it was was
[56:28] one of them was the fact that you sinned
[56:31] and
[56:33] noted all right the other one was the
[56:37] fact that you sinned and didn't know you
[56:39] sinned you know well I never could
[56:43] understand it
[56:45] because all the sin I ever committed I
[56:47] know have done it
[56:49] right well see what it was was a sneaky
[56:53] way to
[56:55] justify some of the things that we've
[56:58] done you know oh I didn't know that was
[57:02] wrong I never read in the Bible as
[57:05] brother Mo said one day I never read in
[57:07] the Bible it says Thou shalt not steal
[57:13] chickens I read about
[57:15] horses
[57:17] cattle sheep but I never read about
[57:21] chickens well see it then you can say
[57:24] well it's all right me steal chickens
[57:28] right I didn't know it was wrong to do
[57:30] that now you ly through your teeth you
[57:32] knew all about it so get away from some
[57:35] kind of a propped up
[57:38] definition and try to come down to a
[57:40] sensible
[57:42] answer all right give an answer of the
[57:45] reason of the hope that is within you
[57:47] that's what the scripture says all right
[57:50] first
[57:52] John 1 18 well let's start in seven
[57:57] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[57:59] the light now that's that light he's
[58:01] talking about that's not
[58:02] daylight that's that light I was talking
[58:05] about to start with where he said let
[58:07] there be
[58:08] light called it's reveal word but if we
[58:11] walk in the light as he is in the light
[58:12] we have Fellowship one with another and
[58:14] the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[58:16] cleanses us from all
[58:20] sin oh that's good the blood of Jesus
[58:23] Christ CL you know cleanses us from all
[58:27] sin yeah verse
[58:30] eight if we say that we have no
[58:37] sin it didn't say if we say we have not
[58:41] or done what you know is no what did it
[58:43] say if we say we have no
[58:46] sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
[58:50] is not in
[58:54] US words I say if you sin today what'
[58:58] brother brand say yes we sin every
[59:03] day did you
[59:06] disbelieve no we've got to get a little
[59:09] better answer
[59:11] somewhere look at the next if we confess
[59:14] our sins he is faithful and just to
[59:15] forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[59:17] from all unrighteousness John look like
[59:20] he's saying over here you okay over here
[59:23] you ain't okay
[59:27] right verse seven covers but verse eight
[59:31] says we say we have no verse S said this
[59:34] blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us from
[59:36] all sin and he says we have we say we
[59:39] have no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[59:42] truth is not in us
[59:44] right so we're just
[59:46] sinners now verse 9 what and if we
[59:49] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[59:51] to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[59:53] from all unrighteousness right
[59:57] now if we sin we confess our
[1:00:03] sins and what if we say that we have not
[1:00:09] sinned that wouldn't mean that just that
[1:00:14] devil P the buck you remember the
[1:00:17] prophet in the garden you know and the
[1:00:20] the the the white woman you gave me you
[1:00:22] know the the animal done it you know
[1:00:24] pass the B get away some away but what
[1:00:26] does it say if we say that we have not
[1:00:27] sinned you talk to people in this
[1:00:30] message they say I always was eternal
[1:00:33] you can't call me a sinner well now if
[1:00:36] you always was eternal like that then
[1:00:38] there's no you can't condemn anybody
[1:00:41] right can you condemn God right sure on
[1:00:45] but you better be careful cuz God never
[1:00:47] was a sinner right
[1:00:51] amen God never had no sin that's
[1:00:54] right and all he done couldn't have been
[1:00:58] sin cuz he had no sin right he knew no
[1:01:02] sin the scriptures
[1:01:03] am if we say that we have not sinned we
[1:01:06] make him a liar and his word is not in
[1:01:15] us read the next verse chapter 2 right
[1:01:19] my love children these things right unto
[1:01:21] you that you sin
[1:01:24] not and if any man sin we have an
[1:01:28] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[1:01:31] the righteous and he is the perpetuation
[1:01:34] for our sins and not for ours only but
[1:01:36] also for the sins of the whole world
[1:01:40] am so now we come up to what the bumper
[1:01:43] blood let the blood of bulls and goats
[1:01:46] covered cuz Adam in the garden as quick
[1:01:49] as he went wrong God killed the animals
[1:01:51] and the blood become an atonement and
[1:01:54] then all of those animal Bloods was
[1:01:55] pushed send
[1:01:57] forward blood
[1:02:00] atonement but the point I'm wanting us
[1:02:02] to get to make sure we understand is
[1:02:07] that not to make it that we've got some
[1:02:10] kind of a gimmick to get out of
[1:02:12] something
[1:02:13] right just be
[1:02:16] honest right brother Brandon do you sin
[1:02:20] he said every
[1:02:23] day but he could turn around back around
[1:02:26] and he'd say show me where I've ever
[1:02:29] disbelieved God's word right
[1:02:34] right why you sin didn't you you must
[1:02:37] have been a
[1:02:40] disbeliever now you going to argue with
[1:02:42] those
[1:02:44] things because remember an argument is
[1:02:46] only to try to prove your
[1:02:48] point right an argument has never been
[1:02:51] worth anything you're only trying to
[1:02:53] prove your point you and an argument
[1:02:57] right to just be honest and say hey look
[1:03:00] you know what you're looking at a sinner
[1:03:02] saved by grace you know what I'm looking
[1:03:05] like out that there sinner saved by
[1:03:07] grace that's
[1:03:09] right see God had to make a way to save
[1:03:13] me but for me to say that I've never
[1:03:16] sinned right that wouldn't mean now that
[1:03:20] was the
[1:03:22] devil
[1:03:24] no it was me
[1:03:26] I don't blame the devil for everything
[1:03:28] goes on in
[1:03:29] Me Maybe you do that's all right that's
[1:03:33] your business that's right we'll find
[1:03:35] out when we get on the other side about
[1:03:36] a lot of these things that's
[1:03:38] right but now
[1:03:44] what one will say one thing but the same
[1:03:47] man
[1:03:49] say one after the
[1:03:52] other right yeah
[1:03:58] see
[1:04:01] God has made a
[1:04:04] way all right but now his way is not for
[1:04:09] us to deny what we've
[1:04:12] done that's right
[1:04:14] amen you know prop it up with some
[1:04:18] reason the devil made me do
[1:04:22] it
[1:04:24] no you got some truth but not all
[1:04:31] truth but you
[1:04:35] see there's got to be something that we
[1:04:38] can get it right
[1:04:41] in so Paul to me sumed it up in Hebrews
[1:04:45] 8:1 there he said we've got a high
[1:04:48] priest now if you didn't have sin why do
[1:04:51] you need a high priest
[1:04:54] right remember the High priest's
[1:04:58] purpose was for
[1:05:01] what to atone for the
[1:05:07] people I'm sure he could go behind the
[1:05:09] veil and he could come back out and
[1:05:11] maybe tell you a lot of things but what
[1:05:13] was the high priest's
[1:05:16] purpose to atone for
[1:05:20] sin now there in John you find somewhere
[1:05:22] rather un close where we're
[1:05:24] at he says we have an
[1:05:32] advocate Jesus Christ the righteous an
[1:05:36] advocate now what do you need an
[1:05:37] advocate for if you not if you have it
[1:05:40] done wrong and are not going to do
[1:05:44] wrong well today I got born again now
[1:05:49] that ended sin for me
[1:05:58] from what we read from what the prophet
[1:06:00] said the day you got born again is when
[1:06:03] you really started sinning
[1:06:07] right now you you want to read it again
[1:06:10] only Christian sin CU that's why it says
[1:06:13] that's i ns
[1:06:19] right only Christians
[1:06:22] sin CU a sinner's condemned
[1:06:29] but my point is is to try to get us away
[1:06:32] from propping up our problems and
[1:06:38] things and trying in some way
[1:06:41] to
[1:06:44] justify something you know instead of
[1:06:47] just looking at it straight out
[1:06:49] right now if you got a high
[1:06:52] priest that means you need him
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:59] right you need him to make an atonement
[1:07:02] for you that's right you got an advocate
[1:07:05] that means somebody that stands in your
[1:07:07] place
[1:07:10] amen all right so you need
[1:07:14] that for us to say we're not
[1:07:19] guilty or have not sinned we're Liars
[1:07:23] right
[1:07:25] to say that we don't sin every day we're
[1:07:30] Liars well you sure don't have a good
[1:07:32] way presenting something I'm
[1:07:35] sorry I would to God I could find better
[1:07:38] words but there's one thing about it and
[1:07:40] I get through you'll be thinking about
[1:07:41] it right right because you won't wind up
[1:07:45] with something there and say well I know
[1:07:47] what it was all the
[1:07:48] time no at least you'll think about
[1:07:50] what's being said
[1:07:54] right cuz you see folks whether you like
[1:07:57] it or not we're just Sinners that are
[1:07:59] saved by
[1:08:01] grace an
[1:08:05] unbeliever he's not a
[1:08:09] sinner he's just a human
[1:08:14] amen hey just a human being and that's
[1:08:17] where we were Paul said we were had our
[1:08:19] conversation and the that's where we
[1:08:21] were we were just human beings that
[1:08:23] followed after the world
[1:08:27] right and you know when you was in the
[1:08:30] world was you going around saying now
[1:08:34] you that drank and stuff like that and
[1:08:35] everything but did you go around back
[1:08:37] then saying
[1:08:41] well brother colie ask you that question
[1:08:44] okay when you was out
[1:08:47] there did you say well the devil made me
[1:08:50] do
[1:08:52] it and he says no
[1:08:56] well then why would we I'm not mean
[1:08:57] about you brother collie I'm just
[1:09:00] using why would we come up under
[1:09:03] Christianity then and try to blame the
[1:09:05] devil for what we
[1:09:09] do
[1:09:10] when that we were Sinners we we didn't
[1:09:13] even blame the devil that was your buddy
[1:09:18] you we were in his
[1:09:21] domain doing the things that he would do
[1:09:25] right right had no thoughts of
[1:09:28] sin
[1:09:31] right but then after becoming Christian
[1:09:34] sin enters the
[1:09:38] picture well brother d i I know though
[1:09:42] you're going to bring it down to it and
[1:09:44] but see the new birth is what takes care
[1:09:45] of it all right I agree with
[1:09:50] you the new birth makes you a Christian
[1:09:58] right and it does a way of all of your
[1:10:01] past
[1:10:06] sins
[1:10:08] now we've got a little negative that
[1:10:10] falls in
[1:10:13] here because the new birth does away
[1:10:16] with all of your P
[1:10:21] sins but it doesn't cleanse your
[1:10:23] marriage and divorce situation that you
[1:10:26] was
[1:10:28] right it doesn't do it see that's where
[1:10:30] people teach that it does where you
[1:10:32] going to get it from why brother around
[1:10:33] have to preach marriage and divorce for
[1:10:35] why didn't you just tell us the new bird
[1:10:36] took care of
[1:10:37] everything well you say this and you say
[1:10:41] that you're just confusing me no no I'm
[1:10:43] sorry you was already confused you got
[1:10:46] here that way right you blaming me for
[1:10:49] the point no
[1:10:51] uh-uh I'm giving you scripture
[1:10:58] the new birth does do away with sin
[1:11:02] right it chops off your past sins
[1:11:05] justification does that amen
[1:11:08] sanctification Works upon your nature of
[1:11:10] your being and your person then the
[1:11:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:11:14] lives within you and then now you can go
[1:11:16] to John
[1:11:20] 1:3
[1:11:21] all you can go to John 1:3 that says
[1:11:24] what
[1:11:26] whosoever is born of
[1:11:29] God does not commit
[1:11:32] sin for his seed remaineth in
[1:11:35] him and he cannot sin because he is born
[1:11:39] of
[1:11:43] God in this the children of God are
[1:11:46] manifest in what and the children of the
[1:11:50] devil the children of God and Children
[1:11:52] of the devil is Manifest in what
[1:11:54] whosoever doth not righteousness is not
[1:11:56] of God neither he that loveth not his
[1:12:00] brother right but
[1:12:05] now so we read that scripture whosoever
[1:12:08] is born of God does not commit
[1:12:12] sin so we went through the Baptist
[1:12:15] Presbyterian all of them days and trying
[1:12:17] to find out what the word commit me and
[1:12:19] we thought it meant this and we thought
[1:12:20] it meant that we we come up with the
[1:12:22] conclusion that that was just not a
[1:12:24] constant prac ice it was just a problem
[1:12:27] and you know and all this that and the
[1:12:28] other well that's all well and good but
[1:12:31] why not just be
[1:12:35] sensible if I can prove the point by the
[1:12:37] Bible and the prophet's message then you
[1:12:38] ought to be able to listen to it
[1:12:41] that once you're born
[1:12:44] again it's the seed that remaineth in
[1:12:47] you that doesn't sin amen that's right
[1:12:50] right that's what we just read right the
[1:12:54] seed don't
[1:13:00] sin it doesn't say that
[1:13:03] the person don't
[1:13:05] sin right say for his seed remaineth in
[1:13:09] you and you cannot
[1:13:12] sin now don't be too far off though
[1:13:15] let's remember keep it right just
[1:13:17] remember the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:18] doesn't atone for sin amen thank Lord
[1:13:22] cuz we're not going to die and go to
[1:13:23] hell if you're a sin if you're a
[1:13:27] Christian you could not sin enough to be
[1:13:29] able to be lost that's
[1:13:33] right there's no way if you're ever
[1:13:36] truly born again but if you're ever
[1:13:38] truly born again how would you want to
[1:13:39] do
[1:13:40] that why would you want to do things
[1:13:42] that are wrong what would be the thing
[1:13:45] that would be in your mind to make you
[1:13:46] think about
[1:13:49] it well I can do this and get by with it
[1:13:51] because I got a lovely father just
[1:13:54] remember
[1:13:56] we'll get on over here in a minute if we
[1:13:57] got
[1:13:58] time and we'll continue that positive to
[1:14:01] perfect we'll continue that looking like
[1:14:04] you know partial to perfect realization
[1:14:06] that part of looking like this one
[1:14:08] saying this and this is saying that
[1:14:09] we'll get on something else in a minute
[1:14:10] so just hold on I just want to make sure
[1:14:13] you understand
[1:14:15] me see it's the seed of God that cannot
[1:14:19] sin right it is not the product that is
[1:14:23] you're looking at right amen because you
[1:14:26] can't see the seat of
[1:14:28] God the seat of God is a new
[1:14:32] birth right that's within me and you
[1:14:35] can't see that so you can see me and my
[1:14:40] problems all right and here's the main
[1:14:43] point I want you to see please write
[1:14:45] this down just remember because you're
[1:14:47] born
[1:14:49] again it don't give you a right to sin
[1:14:52] but you're going to do it that's right
[1:14:55] because you're a
[1:15:00] human you're a human right the spirit
[1:15:04] and the body of a person is not born
[1:15:06] again right amen you're a human you're
[1:15:10] going to make
[1:15:11] mistakes you're going to do
[1:15:19] wrong anybody wants to say they went
[1:15:21] through the whole day today without sin
[1:15:23] you sure I'll just forg get mine out of
[1:15:24] the way but them behind me because I
[1:15:26] wouldn't want my hand
[1:15:29] up you know why I believe it that way no
[1:15:33] I don't think I got it wrote in your
[1:15:34] brain the Bible said anything that is
[1:15:37] not a
[1:15:38] faith is sin that's
[1:15:43] right anything that's not a faith the
[1:15:45] Bible said is
[1:15:47] sin so anything you and I
[1:15:52] do that's not connected with the
[1:15:54] Christian realm of
[1:15:57] Revelation is
[1:16:02] sin when we get over where brother
[1:16:04] random says it like this
[1:16:08] that at the Judgment
[1:16:10] seat you hear those Heathen
[1:16:14] screaming because you didn't y help them
[1:16:18] y
[1:16:25] we're not going to the white Throne I
[1:16:26] didn't say white
[1:16:29] Throne neither did the prophet say white
[1:16:35] throne but now
[1:16:37] listen anything you and I do as a human
[1:16:42] being that is not connected to the
[1:16:44] spiritually revealed word and the
[1:16:47] revelation of God's word is
[1:16:51] sin you know it's sin to eat too much
[1:16:59] but you know what you can make it a sin
[1:17:01] and not eat enough
[1:17:05] right that's what I was asking Richard
[1:17:07] the day he was talking about some of
[1:17:09] nutritional things and how they were
[1:17:11] little bitty I said why in the world
[1:17:13] can't us human beings find a middle of
[1:17:14] the road that's right we're either
[1:17:16] overweight or
[1:17:18] underweight and you never see a fat slob
[1:17:22] running down the road
[1:17:25] always skin
[1:17:27] right you go to the workout place it's
[1:17:31] not the fat men are women that are in
[1:17:33] there working
[1:17:35] out no it's the skinny
[1:17:42] ones why can't we find the middle of the
[1:17:46] road but the Bible says and the prophet
[1:17:49] says we're Sinners but then the Bible
[1:17:51] and the prophet both says we're not
[1:17:53] sinners now what are we going to do
[1:17:56] do let's draw a conclusion what are we
[1:17:59] going to
[1:18:03] do let's finalize this point of
[1:18:07] something that maybe will help
[1:18:11] us I mentioned it
[1:18:13] Sunday 1 John 5:116 And1
[1:18:18] 17 says there is a sin unto
[1:18:22] death but there's a sin that is not
[1:18:24] under death
[1:18:27] right now are you going to
[1:18:29] categorize sin as total
[1:18:35] unbelief it's easy to say that if it's
[1:18:38] if you're just going to have one
[1:18:39] conclusion of sin that it's unbelief you
[1:18:42] know
[1:18:43] just like that then you're going to have
[1:18:45] to send all of us to
[1:18:48] hell because we'd all admit we're
[1:18:50] sinners
[1:18:54] but you know in the Old Testament as I
[1:18:56] was bringing out Sunday you know that
[1:18:58] that the children of Israel sinned 10
[1:19:00] times before they got to Cades
[1:19:02] Baria right and you know they was on
[1:19:05] their way to the promised land oh they
[1:19:07] got weapons for doing it but they was on
[1:19:09] the way to the promised land right when
[1:19:11] they got to Cades
[1:19:13] Baria and would not believe the two
[1:19:16] spies that brought the truth back right
[1:19:18] and a bunch of grapes they took two to
[1:19:22] carry and you know I don't believe the
[1:19:24] other 10 guys is carrying that I I just
[1:19:25] kind of believe that Joshua and Caleb
[1:19:27] was the two guys carrying Them Grapes
[1:19:28] you know cuz the others didn't want to
[1:19:30] bring back a good report some of them
[1:19:33] probably had little screen up dried up
[1:19:35] prunes carried them around you know
[1:19:39] no what all
[1:19:41] right but when they said God we can't do
[1:19:45] it
[1:19:47] right he said
[1:19:49] okay that's the unbelief that I'm not
[1:19:52] going to do that's one under
[1:19:57] death you sin now under death and you
[1:20:01] will die in the
[1:20:03] wilderness and the Bible says they were
[1:20:05] everyone
[1:20:07] dead that's right Jesus said our F they
[1:20:10] said unto the Jesus our fathers a man he
[1:20:13] said in there everyone dead which means
[1:20:16] eternally separated from God Amen now
[1:20:20] was everybody in the Old Testament
[1:20:22] eternally separated from God no no oh no
[1:20:25] no only those that the unbelief existed
[1:20:30] in so there must be something about Sin
[1:20:34] that we can talk about it in a a degree
[1:20:36] of understanding that it's not it's flat
[1:20:40] out killed
[1:20:43] us but there's a sin that is let's read
[1:20:45] that first what is it 1 John 5:16 right
[1:20:49] I want to read the whole thing
[1:20:57] verse 16 if a man see his brother sin a
[1:21:00] sin which is not unto
[1:21:05] death
[1:21:06] what so there's got to be a sin that's
[1:21:08] not under
[1:21:10] death so there must be a sin that is not
[1:21:13] un
[1:21:15] unbeliever because if it was not he
[1:21:17] couldn't have said that
[1:21:20] right are you
[1:21:22] listening don't you ever ask analyze
[1:21:25] anything as you try to read
[1:21:29] it I like what brother hter said he said
[1:21:32] if a equals
[1:21:33] B it's a good sign that b and a is the
[1:21:36] same thing I said hey that's a good
[1:21:39] point I remember
[1:21:43] that but look if any man see his brother
[1:21:46] s a sin which is not under death he
[1:21:49] shall ask and he shall give him
[1:21:52] life oh
[1:21:54] for them that sin not under death there
[1:21:58] is a sin under
[1:22:01] death I do not say that he shall pray
[1:22:05] for
[1:22:06] it all right unrighteousness is sin and
[1:22:09] there is a sin unto death now what's the
[1:22:14] next verse we know that whosoever is
[1:22:16] born of God sinth
[1:22:18] not but he is he that is B of God
[1:22:21] keepeth himself and that Wicked one
[1:22:23] touches him not MH all right
[1:22:26] now what is the sin unto
[1:22:32] death
[1:22:34] right now it's an
[1:22:37] unbeliever cuz he's condemned
[1:22:41] already all right now bring it on down a
[1:22:45] little closer what is the sin unto death
[1:22:46] brother
[1:22:47] Dale it is blaspheming the Holy Ghost
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:54] blaspheming the Holy Ghost is a sin
[1:22:55] under
[1:22:57] death cuz you dis believe
[1:23:00] God brother R said you be careful about
[1:23:02] what you see people doing and things
[1:23:04] that might be the Holy Spirit on them
[1:23:07] and he said you make a lot of it he said
[1:23:08] you can seal your
[1:23:13] doom you say well well brother Dale I
[1:23:16] remember when our life when somebody was
[1:23:18] doing so and so well ask God what you
[1:23:21] done wrong then ask him is he holding
[1:23:23] against you
[1:23:25] well I didn't know I needed to ask him
[1:23:26] what you do
[1:23:29] now ask him as he holding against
[1:23:33] you and don't be like Tammy Fay Baker
[1:23:36] that asked him was it all right to wear
[1:23:39] makeup she said he didn't answer me so I
[1:23:42] guess it was all
[1:23:44] right check out your life examine
[1:23:47] yourself to see whether you're in the
[1:23:48] faith or
[1:23:52] not you might lie to
[1:23:55] somebody and then really be in the Holy
[1:23:57] Ghost you can see you're done that's
[1:23:58] right am but I love this part of it
[1:24:01] because that's the next verse we just
[1:24:04] read
[1:24:07] what that where is
[1:24:11] it and we know that the Son of God
[1:24:13] excuse me where it where s is not okay
[1:24:16] Verse 18 we know that whosoever is born
[1:24:18] of God sent us not all right now if you
[1:24:20] got to baptism of the Holy Ghost you
[1:24:22] can't blashe the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:24:25] so you see why the prophet would say the
[1:24:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most
[1:24:28] important thing that could ever be in
[1:24:30] life am all right if you're wondering
[1:24:32] about whether or not you sealed your
[1:24:33] doom on some things you done why don't
[1:24:35] you just seek the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:37] Ghost right right
[1:24:39] y well what do you
[1:24:42] mean I've had it 40
[1:24:48] years I'm not going to argue with
[1:24:52] you I'm just going to ask you to same
[1:24:54] question again have you asked God to
[1:24:56] forgive you
[1:25:00] right have you just really ask God to
[1:25:03] forgive you of the things you done in
[1:25:04] your life well I thought when I got born
[1:25:06] again and took care of
[1:25:10] everything well you might find out one
[1:25:14] of these days we are just all Sinners
[1:25:15] saved by
[1:25:18] grace what's the difference between you
[1:25:20] and me and anybody
[1:25:22] else yep the New Birth the only
[1:25:27] difference amen that there
[1:25:30] is all
[1:25:32] right see what are we what are you
[1:25:34] trying to get to then brother Dale
[1:25:36] there's a sin unto
[1:25:38] death
[1:25:40] now here's one that's real
[1:25:43] close that you can pray for the person
[1:25:46] that is just a sinner is that right you
[1:25:49] see your brother s a sin that's not
[1:25:50] under death you pray for him in other
[1:25:51] words you see somebody do something
[1:25:53] wrong he's not laughing making fun of
[1:25:55] God he's out done something wrong he's
[1:25:57] backslid he's went off done this out or
[1:25:59] the other will you pray for him
[1:26:03] amen but if he's out there lifing and
[1:26:05] making fun of the word of
[1:26:10] God you're not supposed to pray for him
[1:26:13] because right he's
[1:26:18] blaspheming well now he doesn't know it
[1:26:20] well now the ones that does
[1:26:22] know we going on that route okay but you
[1:26:26] see if this church prays for
[1:26:29] somebody you know if something goes
[1:26:31] wrong and we've had to do it to where we
[1:26:33] commit somebody in other words we lose
[1:26:35] them from the
[1:26:38] church see if you lose somebody from the
[1:26:41] church you can't pray for that person
[1:26:43] anymore right that's right and you leave
[1:26:46] it up to God whether or not they've done
[1:26:50] wrong if they're a Christian they'll
[1:26:52] straighten up and come back cuz the
[1:26:54] devil to go after them but if they're
[1:26:56] not a Christian you'll find out they've
[1:26:59] already blasphemed
[1:27:03] right he said brother Dale you put
[1:27:05] limits upon what we no no don't put no
[1:27:08] limits I put
[1:27:11] Bible that's why I try to tell you over
[1:27:14] and over about your families your
[1:27:16] children husband wife Etc you commit
[1:27:19] them to you say all right I want to
[1:27:21] commit them to the Lord cuz we don't
[1:27:23] believe in committing to the devil we
[1:27:25] believe in committing to the Lord the
[1:27:26] prophet said and then he commits them to
[1:27:28] the devil so we're not turning somebody
[1:27:30] over to the devil that's not you know
[1:27:33] you turn him over to God and God turned
[1:27:35] him
[1:27:36] loose and then you see the person
[1:27:38] starting getting sicker and sicker oh
[1:27:40] Lord I didn't mean
[1:27:42] that now you just interrupted God's plan
[1:27:45] right leave it
[1:27:47] alone that's right yes but that's my
[1:27:49] child
[1:27:56] but what are we going to do go contrary
[1:27:57] to the word because it's your
[1:28:01] child you could do it for somebody else
[1:28:03] but you couldn't do it for your
[1:28:04] own you see folks I stand in a horrible
[1:28:08] place it's like I've always told
[1:28:11] you so you can sit back there and you
[1:28:13] can say well brother or sister so and so
[1:28:15] done so and so who's got the first stone
[1:28:17] throw it well then hand the stone cuz
[1:28:18] I'm the guy that has to throw the stone
[1:28:21] I can't help
[1:28:22] it cuz I'm going one in
[1:28:27] charge because I got to follow what the
[1:28:29] word says right I know that ain't what
[1:28:32] we're talking about
[1:28:34] okay do we do things because we're
[1:28:38] unbelievers or is it the fact that
[1:28:41] because of seeing that there is a sin
[1:28:43] under death and a sin not under death
[1:28:45] and seeing those things is it the fact
[1:28:47] that we can look at it with a basis of
[1:28:49] thinking well all right God doesn't kill
[1:28:53] us for all the things we do
[1:28:58] right and we're covered by the blood to
[1:29:01] keep him from destroying us because we
[1:29:03] done one thing
[1:29:07] wrong without the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:09] we'd be stoned to death from
[1:29:16] heaven so then it must be things in our
[1:29:19] lives that that we can talk about then
[1:29:21] that are are not what would be called a
[1:29:23] sin un
[1:29:26] death but just remember
[1:29:29] now oh youall found it Romans 14 and 23
[1:29:32] says whatsoever is not a faith is
[1:29:37] sin that's Romans
[1:29:43] 14:23 in the Old Testament it was the
[1:29:46] blood that covered their sins
[1:29:54] Adam didn't kill the animal God did and
[1:29:58] made a blood
[1:30:00] atonement got a lot of quotes down
[1:30:02] through here where that the blood of
[1:30:03] Jesus
[1:30:05] Christ is a bumper blood to cover you
[1:30:08] and
[1:30:12] I I I'm under that bumper of blood where
[1:30:14] would we
[1:30:16] be now remember the bumper blood is the
[1:30:19] blood of Jesus Christ the life of Jesus
[1:30:21] Christ Living In You and I by the new
[1:30:23] birth all right right you understand it
[1:30:26] the life living in Us by the new
[1:30:28] birth but everybody in the world is
[1:30:31] under the bumper blood to the basis that
[1:30:33] he's not
[1:30:36] destroying it'll be when it's all
[1:30:38] finished brother Bram says paragraph 264
[1:30:42] the proving his word
[1:30:44] 64
[1:30:46] 716 said God don't see
[1:30:49] me he just hears my
[1:30:52] voice through the blood of Jes Jesus
[1:30:56] Christ so what is the difference between
[1:30:58] you and I and The
[1:31:03] Sinner we're all under the
[1:31:07] bumper all
[1:31:09] protected see what's going to happen one
[1:31:11] of these days the reason the wrath of
[1:31:13] God is going to be poured out in the
[1:31:15] tribulation that the bride does not go
[1:31:16] through the tribulation the wrath of God
[1:31:18] will be poured out why because
[1:31:20] when the bride goes the Holy Ghost goes
[1:31:23] right amen the blood atonement is gone
[1:31:26] that's it the mercy seed in the Old
[1:31:28] Testament when the blood left the mercy
[1:31:30] seed it was become a judgment seat so is
[1:31:34] it when we leave out of
[1:31:36] here but now
[1:31:39] watch see these are things that people
[1:31:42] don't like to
[1:31:44] cover but you
[1:31:46] know all sin must be accounted for
[1:31:55] now whether it be a little sin that is
[1:31:58] not under death a big sin that is under
[1:32:03] death one day there's going to be an
[1:32:07] answering
[1:32:09] day all
[1:32:12] right
[1:32:14] now there will be a white thrown
[1:32:17] judgment one
[1:32:19] day that the sinner will have to stand
[1:32:21] before
[1:32:24] foolish
[1:32:25] virgins
[1:32:28] Etc will have to stand before the white
[1:32:30] Throne
[1:32:31] judgment to give an
[1:32:36] account but you see to be a Christian
[1:32:40] don't give you a license to
[1:32:42] steal right because just remember we
[1:32:46] gave it the other day where the Prophet
[1:32:48] said you sin a sin as a Christian you
[1:32:51] will reap a washtub full
[1:32:55] and you know what's the biggest Warr
[1:32:58] that I've ever had poured on me or been
[1:33:02] in is for me to allow
[1:33:05] Satan to come within me in enough to
[1:33:09] speak to me through my body and my
[1:33:11] spirit to be able to get me to think
[1:33:14] wrong to act wrong right to do
[1:33:21] wrong you don't ever do wrong
[1:33:26] I
[1:33:28] wouldn't you see I I believe we got to
[1:33:31] have an
[1:33:33] atonement
[1:33:36] sir to cover our
[1:33:39] sins but you see the bride
[1:33:42] now be glad to give you
[1:33:46] these brother brand them on the
[1:33:50] U 225 Church age book
[1:33:55] he said that won't be the bride sitting
[1:33:57] there you know before the Judgment he
[1:34:01] said she'll be sitting on the throne
[1:34:03] with him right
[1:34:06] amen he goes over to 278 of the same
[1:34:09] book and he says where it says there're
[1:34:12] as sheep you remember in ROM I mean in
[1:34:14] Matthew 25 I think it's talking about
[1:34:16] the white Throne judgment it says as
[1:34:19] sheeps and goats he said see that's not
[1:34:21] sheep cuz it says as sheep right see the
[1:34:24] as sheep is the foolish
[1:34:26] virgins right that claim it but they
[1:34:28] don't have a total possession they're
[1:34:30] not
[1:34:31] sheep but they're as
[1:34:33] sheep see the foolish virgins and the
[1:34:36] people like that in the center will have
[1:34:37] to stand at the watch thr own judgment
[1:34:39] but we're going to set on that judgment
[1:34:41] with him cuz brother Brandon you know I
[1:34:43] I've tried to give you the the the
[1:34:45] things that we like paragraph uh 970 of
[1:34:49] the questions and answers 19 in conduct
[1:34:51] order Doctrine 64 823
[1:34:53] brother Rand would explain what this is
[1:34:55] going to be and what this is going to be
[1:34:57] and what this is going to be and this is
[1:34:58] going to be I love that all right now
[1:35:01] here you got the Bri she goes up in the
[1:35:02] Rapture
[1:35:04] right the tribulation comes after we go
[1:35:07] up in the Rapture we're already made
[1:35:10] Eternal Body Spirit and
[1:35:14] soul so we don't go through the
[1:35:16] tribulation we miss all of that and he
[1:35:18] tells about the Millennium that we go
[1:35:20] through the millennial Reign and then we
[1:35:23] go up on out of Realms of the earth
[1:35:25] while Satan is being annihilated Etc and
[1:35:28] things is happening then there'll be a
[1:35:30] white Throne
[1:35:31] judgment and we'll sit on the throne
[1:35:33] with him judging the
[1:35:36] world Bible says you'll even judge
[1:35:39] Angels that's a born again
[1:35:42] believer not that we chose maybe to do
[1:35:45] it but he chose
[1:35:47] it right but see then there'll be a
[1:35:49] future home you know but my point is now
[1:35:54] we're going to
[1:35:59] have and not we're not going to be at
[1:36:01] that before the white Throne because we
[1:36:04] done been Eternal for over a thousand
[1:36:06] years of Earthly
[1:36:08] time the bride don't sit on don't stand
[1:36:11] before the
[1:36:14] Judgment but now what about these
[1:36:16] scriptures look in Romans 14
[1:36:24] 14:
[1:36:34] 10 but why Dost thou judge thy brother
[1:36:38] or why does thou set it not which means
[1:36:40] to despise why do you despise my
[1:36:43] brother for we shall all stand before
[1:36:47] the
[1:36:48] Judgment seed of Christ
[1:36:55] yeah where's
[1:36:57] that drop over to Second
[1:37:00] Corinthians 5 and
[1:37:11] 10 for we must all appear before the
[1:37:14] Judgment seat of
[1:37:17] Christ that everyone may receive the
[1:37:20] things done in his body according to
[1:37:23] that he hath done whether it be good or
[1:37:30] bad even Scofield says that this is not
[1:37:33] the white Throne judgment because it's
[1:37:35] not the believer's works it's the
[1:37:37] believer's works but not the sin of the
[1:37:40] believer that's in
[1:37:42] question and he knew that by the Greek
[1:37:44] and the things from studying it cuz one
[1:37:48] is the be a judgment and I forgot what
[1:37:49] the other one is there's two judgments
[1:37:52] in the Bible of judgment seat of
[1:37:54] Christ one is the white Throne judgment
[1:37:57] but we don't set go before the white
[1:37:58] Throne judgment we set on the white
[1:38:00] throne with him that's right judging the
[1:38:04] world but there is a judgment of the
[1:38:06] Deeds Done in the body whether good or
[1:38:12] bad so every sin that you and I do as a
[1:38:15] human sinner Christian we must give an
[1:38:20] account why else would you want to plead
[1:38:22] some fact that you think you're
[1:38:28] okay and I'm born again it don't matter
[1:38:32] what I do now you're on once saved
[1:38:34] always saved Baptist
[1:38:39] Doctrine cuz that's what they
[1:38:42] believe like Steven Wilson said one day
[1:38:45] stepen I said he said you know they
[1:38:47] going to have to do away with hell cuz
[1:38:48] there ain't going to be nobody there cuz
[1:38:50] everybody's going to heaven cuz don't
[1:38:52] matter how mean a guy is the preacher
[1:38:54] that's up in the pool pit he'll say
[1:38:57] brother so and so is up in heaven now
[1:38:59] rejoicing with his
[1:39:02] family
[1:39:04] you you say well how do you know well he
[1:39:07] paved the parking lot one time see his
[1:39:09] name on that
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:12] Pew you
[1:39:14] know let's don't be that way okay am
[1:39:18] let's be straight and
[1:39:20] honest and just face the fact of one
[1:39:22] thing
[1:39:24] that we're all Sinners saved by grace
[1:39:26] and everything that we do in this world
[1:39:28] that's not a faith is
[1:39:35] sin and just face it up to the front of
[1:39:38] knowing I want to be clean I'm like
[1:39:40] brother brand said about the old black
[1:39:42] brother he said I just don't want no
[1:39:44] trouble when it comes down to the river
[1:39:47] that's
[1:39:48] right I told you that while ago if
[1:39:51] you're a born again Christian there's no
[1:39:53] way
[1:39:53] that a born again Christian can sin
[1:39:55] enough to be able to be lost and die and
[1:39:57] go to hell you can't do it but your life
[1:39:59] could be short what about the man on the
[1:40:01] Hebrew Book the preacher that got some
[1:40:03] beer and got drunk went out two weeks
[1:40:05] later he's
[1:40:06] dead brother around said God will not
[1:40:09] let his child Mar his
[1:40:14] name did you
[1:40:17] see we'll all stand before the Judgment
[1:40:19] seat of
[1:40:20] Christ that's not the white Throne
[1:40:22] judgment
[1:40:25] but it's a
[1:40:26] judgment of the Deeds Done in the bodies
[1:40:29] that we
[1:40:30] read whether they're good or
[1:40:33] bad it's fine to think about the rewards
[1:40:36] of what good we
[1:40:37] do cuz you know on that same quote that
[1:40:40] brother brandham I had it in there
[1:40:41] somewhere the same quote where he says
[1:40:45] that he would hear at the what at the at
[1:40:48] the Judgment seat of Christ we would
[1:40:49] hear those heer screaming out but right
[1:40:52] down below it he says but just think
[1:40:55] you're the people that give the money
[1:40:56] for me to go he said you'll be rewarded
[1:40:59] for
[1:41:00] that it's whether it's good or
[1:41:05] bad if we don't confess our sins
[1:41:09] here
[1:41:10] then
[1:41:13] somewh the question will be asked us
[1:41:17] what about the time you done so and
[1:41:20] so and didn't straighten up
[1:41:25] it's like I told you people believe it's
[1:41:28] been preached here by Brother one time
[1:41:29] years ago that he believe the new
[1:41:32] birth took care of all your sins even
[1:41:35] your marriage and
[1:41:36] divorce I said I can't go that
[1:41:40] way New Birth finished in a Rapture
[1:41:43] maybe that's what he's talking about I
[1:41:45] don't
[1:41:47] know but just because you say you're
[1:41:49] born again the prophet had to preach
[1:41:52] marriage and divorce that's right amen
[1:41:54] if not you could have not received the
[1:41:57] grace and it's a whole lot more you know
[1:41:59] how I preach it it's a whole lot more
[1:42:01] than just what you've done in your body
[1:42:03] you can sit right there and say I virgin
[1:42:06] born and all this that and the other and
[1:42:09] that's
[1:42:12] wonderful but it goes into the spiritual
[1:42:15] too what about spiritual
[1:42:17] fornication have we ever asked him to
[1:42:20] for to forgive us of the things we
[1:42:21] believed as the Trinity that we used to
[1:42:24] believe
[1:42:26] in as the things we used to believe have
[1:42:29] we asked him to forgive
[1:42:33] us so then there'll be a judgment
[1:42:37] seat don't ask me where it's at and when
[1:42:40] it takes place cuz I don't
[1:42:43] know you say well it's here well if it's
[1:42:46] here we better start confessing
[1:42:48] everything we do wrong instead of
[1:42:50] letting it pass the Bible said don't let
[1:42:52] the s the sun go down on your
[1:42:56] wrath that's why every night when your
[1:42:58] head hits the pillow the last thing you
[1:43:00] should say is Father forgive
[1:43:03] me that's the way I
[1:43:05] pray I pray thank you Lord for all that
[1:43:09] you've given me the understanding of
[1:43:11] your word and the healings and signs and
[1:43:13] wonders and the
[1:43:15] things and Lord I love you forgive me of
[1:43:19] my
[1:43:20] sins cuz I don't want nothing see if you
[1:43:23] say forgive
[1:43:25] me I can even show you where brother
[1:43:27] Brown says it like
[1:43:29] this he said God knows your heart and
[1:43:33] you didn't mean to do that and he said
[1:43:35] it wouldn't even
[1:43:40] counted you said well cuz he he knows
[1:43:43] her
[1:43:46] heart he knows our heart amen but see
[1:43:50] sin has to be dealt with amen
[1:43:55] right that's why we're going to St go by
[1:43:58] the grave why because we won't face up
[1:44:01] to who we are and what's going
[1:44:04] on we try to think about all of the
[1:44:07] things that that is this that or the
[1:44:09] other I was thinking today about
[1:44:13] it you know people say
[1:44:16] well brother D I don't believe you're at
[1:44:19] adoption I've never said where I at
[1:44:20] never have said nothing about it some
[1:44:23] say brother Dale you're
[1:44:25] adopted some says brother Dale we don't
[1:44:27] believe you are well if you don't
[1:44:29] believe I am and I'm not saying whether
[1:44:31] I'm not CU don't
[1:44:33] know if you're not if you're saying I'm
[1:44:35] not then what are you gauging it
[1:44:39] by you must be gaging it by your
[1:44:46] life
[1:44:49] okay it goes into the wrong thing folks
[1:44:52] why why don't we want to judge anyway
[1:44:54] why don't we all want to have
[1:44:57] Grace and believe for
[1:44:59] everybody and pray for everybody other
[1:45:02] than what the scripture says don't
[1:45:07] pray but if we done all of her praying
[1:45:10] rightly there probably wouldn't be much
[1:45:12] if we couldn't pray
[1:45:17] for when you read that scripture that
[1:45:19] said if a brother see a brother s a sin
[1:45:22] you ask and it'll be
[1:45:24] given
[1:45:27] what it's like that
[1:45:30] scripture call for the elders last see
[1:45:33] quot call lay hands on the sick right
[1:45:36] and if they've committed any sin right
[1:45:38] it shall be forgiven them that's right
[1:45:42] you mean because you prayed for them
[1:45:45] well that's what the Bible says right
[1:45:48] amen you can pray for the sins of the
[1:45:50] people
[1:45:54] but do you understand what the
[1:45:55] conclusion I'm trying to make trying to
[1:45:57] draw it to a
[1:45:59] conclusion that Judgment of the deeds in
[1:46:03] the body
[1:46:04] somewhere we're going to have to answer
[1:46:06] for what we didn't confess here right
[1:46:11] you said well
[1:46:12] then I don't understand it because you
[1:46:14] say that
[1:46:16] perfect I'm
[1:46:18] perfect when I'm standing in him
[1:46:25] and when my sins are
[1:46:26] confessed I'm standing
[1:46:29] perfect about two minutes later you got
[1:46:32] other things to deal
[1:46:34] with
[1:46:36] right would you agree with
[1:46:39] it you can stand there one time and be
[1:46:41] so perfect until the god of Glory can
[1:46:44] come down into your
[1:46:46] presence and in the next minute you
[1:46:48] wouldn't want God to come for nothing
[1:46:50] that's right
[1:46:55] but J I'm just trying to get you to
[1:46:59] see partial realization perfect
[1:47:05] realization brings us to an
[1:47:07] understanding that sure we're all
[1:47:10] Sinners today but we have an
[1:47:14] atonement which is the blood of Jesus
[1:47:16] Christ we have his own life dwelling
[1:47:19] within us by the new birth that's right
[1:47:22] amen and we plead that blood and that
[1:47:24] day said God forgive
[1:47:29] me sister used to go to church here
[1:47:31] years
[1:47:32] ago she said brother Dale this is way
[1:47:35] back when we was preaching he said the
[1:47:36] way you and brother M are preaching how
[1:47:38] perfect we are this is exactly what we
[1:47:40] was preaching she said who did I pray
[1:47:45] to I said sister you've missed the whole
[1:47:49] point see she didn't realize that she
[1:47:52] was a sinner
[1:47:54] I realize I'm a sinner I don't know what
[1:47:56] you think I'm a sinner that's saved by
[1:48:01] grace I can't be lost because God can't
[1:48:04] be lost and the seed of God cannot sin
[1:48:07] that remains in me but my body and my
[1:48:10] spirit can always do wrong and until
[1:48:12] that is made Eternal I have a
[1:48:17] problem to dealing every day in my
[1:48:21] life that's why you you say Brother D I
[1:48:23] don't understand how sometimes you can
[1:48:25] put up with things cuz listen
[1:48:28] folks I remember one
[1:48:31] thing every how I look down on you
[1:48:35] that's the way my God is looking down on
[1:48:38] me but yes I got to tell us the truth I
[1:48:42] got to say truth like truth and call it
[1:48:44] truth that's
[1:48:45] right but just remember it's from my
[1:48:49] heart of
[1:48:51] love I preach because I love you not to
[1:48:54] be saved I don't have to preach to be
[1:48:57] saved I preach because I love you and
[1:48:59] want you to see the truth but I want you
[1:49:02] to see it as
[1:49:06] truth I want you to look at things in
[1:49:08] the
[1:49:10] Bible to where that you can look at it
[1:49:13] and say
[1:49:15] listen what God Said is right he said
[1:49:19] we're all Sinners then he says we're all
[1:49:21] Saints
[1:49:28] y he said they nothing good know I one
[1:49:31] then he
[1:49:32] says you're as perfect as your father
[1:49:35] is well now there ain't but one way that
[1:49:37] can be done it has to be what he done
[1:49:41] right
[1:49:43] amen it has to be what he's
[1:49:47] doing cuz I thought we believed that the
[1:49:50] headstone would be coming crying what
[1:49:53] Grace
[1:49:54] Grace unto it what is hollering Grace to
[1:49:58] us we hollering Grace
[1:50:01] back save by grace through
[1:50:07] faith and none of your
[1:50:11] own salvation is of the
[1:50:15] Lord so you just make it look like no
[1:50:19] just remember we're the ones that's
[1:50:21] doing what I'm talking about now you
[1:50:22] can't get it get this point you see if I
[1:50:26] do something
[1:50:27] wrong and I know what I'm doing is wrong
[1:50:30] and I want to admit that is wrong and
[1:50:32] ask God to forgive me then he's going to
[1:50:34] hold that against
[1:50:37] me he has a right
[1:50:41] right because he offered me a little
[1:50:44] simple
[1:50:46] explanation just say I'm
[1:50:49] sorry like I told you about the brother
[1:50:51] though years ago he bought me two $50
[1:50:54] shirts this is back in the 80 two $50
[1:50:58] shirts to give to me only had to do say
[1:51:01] I was
[1:51:03] wrong I'm
[1:51:05] sorry me never would say I'm
[1:51:13] sorry have you ever really just said I'm
[1:51:17] sorry youve ever said
[1:51:19] Lord I'm sorry Lord
[1:51:24] I'm sorry for being the way I've
[1:51:27] been
[1:51:29] amen have you ever said
[1:51:35] it but you know
[1:51:37] what God will keep his promise no matter
[1:51:40] what we
[1:51:42] do he promised it I'm glad of that stand
[1:51:46] for let's Stand
[1:51:50] Together see is sin or we just a bunch
[1:51:53] of
[1:51:54] unbelievers no that seed remaineth in
[1:51:57] you that that that was inside of you
[1:51:59] can't blasing the Holy
[1:52:02] Ghost cuz that's what a sin under death
[1:52:04] is is to blasing the Holy Ghost you
[1:52:05] can't do
[1:52:07] that but you can have
[1:52:11] problems and you know what our problems
[1:52:13] do then are you going to blame God for
[1:52:15] us being
[1:52:19] sick come on we're human we're under the
[1:52:22] curse right but you know what we done it
[1:52:24] this
[1:52:25] way you know I mean when I
[1:52:30] was somewhere in the
[1:52:34] 40s I drank so many Dr Peppers helping
[1:52:38] terance do his house up there 10 and
[1:52:40] something degrees up in that roof and
[1:52:42] just I just down Dr Peppers just one
[1:52:44] right after another and you know what I
[1:52:46] run my elevation of the sugar
[1:52:48] up to not to the sugar but it wound up
[1:52:51] with being high blood pressure
[1:52:56] you know
[1:52:57] what if we eat too much at the wrong
[1:53:00] time are we not bringing those things
[1:53:03] upon
[1:53:04] us and way it is now what can you eat I
[1:53:08] mean come on honestly what can you eat
[1:53:10] cardboard probably be better than
[1:53:13] anything you know what would be more
[1:53:15] healthier than
[1:53:17] anything to go down to the store and buy
[1:53:20] some dog food
[1:53:23] there's more inspection of dog food than
[1:53:26] there is human
[1:53:28] food they put better stuff in dog food
[1:53:32] than what they put in the human
[1:53:37] stuff it would be better eat dog food
[1:53:39] maybe we're swapping the wrong
[1:53:41] place but I know I still love to
[1:53:44] eat you know I just pray God sanctify
[1:53:48] this and help me but like a brother said
[1:53:50] one time he said how can can I wind up
[1:53:53] being wrong if I ask God to
[1:53:55] sanctify you got a
[1:53:57] point but he told
[1:54:00] you you eat too much pork and you will
[1:54:04] have high blood
[1:54:06] pressure now how now how high blood
[1:54:09] pleasure would me asking God to sanctify
[1:54:14] it that might be one of them little sins
[1:54:16] we
[1:54:17] have
[1:54:20] right cuz we know better to do
[1:54:25] it we know better than to eat sweets too
[1:54:28] much
[1:54:32] right we know better than to eat too
[1:54:35] much red
[1:54:39] meat
[1:54:41] why cuz it's contrary to the body so
[1:54:45] balance it
