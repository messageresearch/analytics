[16:09] a few days ago about 15 minutes after
[16:11] she left work a shell landed near the
[16:13] school and damaged the building
[16:15] then she was riding in a bus these
[16:17] people were working while there's a war
[16:19] going on
[16:20] then she was riding in a bus on her way
[16:22] home from the city
[16:23] center of the city and suddenly without
[16:25] realizing what she had done she just got
[16:27] off the bus
[16:29] sometimes we would call that alzheimer's
[16:31] but
[16:32] that was god
[16:35] she didn't know why she got off well you
[16:37] will in just a minute she didn't
[16:39] understand why but she waited for the
[16:40] next bus and drove to her destination
[16:42] when she arrived she saw people running
[16:44] in panic it turned out that a shell had
[16:46] exploded near the bus stop where she
[16:48] would have been
[16:50] where she had to wait to transfer to the
[16:52] next bus she praises god
[16:54] who had preserved her
[16:56] she's a believer there in the ukraine
[16:58] all right next
[17:00] that's what you're looking at there
[17:03] it's just devastation
[17:05] next
[17:07] everybody say i don't know if you can
[17:08] see this picture or not but
[17:10] that's that's brother
[17:12] this is his house and you see what that
[17:13] is
[17:15] i don't know if you can see that or not

[17:29] and it didn't go off
[17:31] that big rocket that big is blow that
[17:34] building up you see how big that thing
[17:35] is
[17:37] we got a miracle working god
[17:39] amen
[17:41] all right next
[17:44] this is some of the believers
[17:46] over in the ukraine
[17:48] they're just like us folks common people
[17:51] work
[17:52] have children
[17:54] and serve the lord
[17:56] amen go ahead next
[17:58] that's one of the buildings that's been
[18:00] bombed out over there in the side of
[18:03] all right next
[18:06] they just do the best they can with that
[18:07] little heater right in front of the
[18:08] children
[18:09] there and it probably looks like a bomb
[18:11] shelter
[18:13] next
[18:15] all right today

[18:27] grenades either
[18:29] those are big old bombs
[18:30] and they didn't explode

[18:34] so next
[18:36] there's
[18:37] the believers hunker down into
[18:39] their home
[18:41] and i believe they're still having
[18:42] church service is what one of the
[18:45] one of the uh
[18:46] reports were so
[18:48] all right next
[18:50] they're in the shelter
[18:53] we just need to keep praying for them
[18:54] folks
[18:55] next
[18:57] and that's back to the
[18:59] to the lady that uh
[19:01] i've always said you know we rush in
[19:02] russian russia and try to get somewhere
[19:04] and and i'm guilty
[19:07] i'm guilty
[19:09] i want to get somewhere real fast
[19:11] right
[19:12] everybody knows that i get it everybody
[19:14] knows that but you know what and i get
[19:15] real aggravated when i don't get there
[19:17] five minutes ahead of time but
[19:19] if something happens and you don't
[19:22] then you find out something a whole
[19:24] bus station blew up
[19:34] patience
[19:36] have some patience brother brown said
[19:38] have patience with god what if we if we
[19:41] if she had not had patience or if she'd
[19:43] just not got off that
[19:44] bus when she did and
[19:47] i know some how many of y'all done that
[19:48] you pull up somewhere and you go what am
[19:50] i doing here
[19:52] you never know
[19:53] you will know though
[19:55] when the time comes i believe when we
[19:57] get across the curtain of time and we
[19:59] get into eternity god will let us know
[20:02] how much more he was with us than we
[20:04] thought
[20:05] he was with us amen
[20:08] so let's get started we'll we'll get on
[20:10] to the uh
[20:11] to some of the placing
[20:13] uh this morning we were talking about
[20:15] the book of ephesians
[20:16] we'll go through that again but let's
[20:18] read romans 8. verse 18.
[20:22] for i reckon that the suffering of the
[20:23] present time there we go
[20:26] are not worthy to be compared with the
[20:27] glory which shall be revealed in us
[20:31] so where where's the conduit where is it
[20:32] going to be revealed it's going to be
[20:34] revealed in us
[20:35] through us
[20:37] for the earnest expectation of the
[20:39] creature our creation waiteth
[20:42] for the manifestation
[20:44] of god in human flesh
[20:48] god back in human flesh like he was when
[20:51] he walked the shores of galilee now
[20:52] though he's in a many-membered body not
[20:55] just one body
[20:57] for the creation was made subject to
[20:59] vanity what what happened in the garden
[21:01] of eden there was a fall
[21:02] all right the creature was made subject
[21:04] to vanity not willingly listen
[21:06] the animals in the world didn't
[21:08] willingly fall who fell man
[21:11] man willingly
[21:13] sorry she didn't know what she was doing
[21:14] but adam sure did
[21:16] he knew what he was doing he was selling
[21:18] the human race out
[21:20] but he knew i believe he knew being a
[21:22] son of god he knew that god was going to
[21:24] have to bring it back
[21:27] amen because the creature itself shall
[21:30] all also shall be delivered
[21:33] all right so here we are
[21:36] we it's been bound
[21:38] now it's going to be delivered from the
[21:39] bondage of corruption and to the
[21:41] glorious liberty of the children of god
[21:43] for we know that the whole creation
[21:46] groaneth and travails in pain together
[21:49] until now
[21:51] the whole world
[21:53] every volcano every tornado every
[21:55] earthquake is all because this world is
[21:58] trying to get back to where it's
[21:59] supposed to be
[22:00] because it's wobbling it's a big ball
[22:02] that's not supposed to be wobbling
[22:03] everything's out of cater now like where
[22:05] it was not out of cater when it was in
[22:07] the garden of eden amen and that's what
[22:09] we're going back to
[22:11] god's going to write this thing back up
[22:13] and we're going to be able to live on it
[22:14] there won't be any groaning or
[22:15] travailing there won't be any sorrow or
[22:17] pain
[22:18] no agony
[22:21] it's going to be all
[22:23] glorious time
[22:26] for the whole
[22:27] we know see look i want you to see all
[22:30] this we went through this this today and
[22:32] we're going to go through it again where
[22:32] it talks about us and we
[22:35] go to your bible and look at all the
[22:36] times that god has talked about us and
[22:38] we and look at verse 22 for we know now
[22:41] this that's paul telling us almost 2 000
[22:44] years ago he said you're gonna know
[22:47] for we know that the whole creation
[22:49] growth now if we know that it's groaning
[22:52] and travailing
[22:54] if we know that
[22:56] then i believe god's obligated to let us
[22:58] know how to get it back
[23:00] how to put it back and he's going to do
[23:02] it through human beings he's going to do
[23:03] it to a fivefold ministry he's going to
[23:05] do it through us being what being
[23:07] subjected to him or to be
[23:10] give him the
[23:12] prominent
[23:13] will
[23:15] and we are predestinated that
[23:17] we're not predestinated to justification
[23:21] we're not predestinated the
[23:22] sanctification
[23:24] we're not predestinated just to the
[23:25] baptism of the holy ghost
[23:27] we're predestinated to adoption and if
[23:29] brother brown said your adoption and
[23:30] your new birth is two different things
[23:32] that we're predestinated beyond
[23:35] the baptism of the holy ghost
[23:38] may i say beyond
[23:40] because it's beyond the just the baby
[23:42] it's the baby that's growing up to the
[23:44] teenager that's growing up to the to the
[23:46] grown man to be able to god can speak to
[23:48] us and that's what our problems been
[23:51] listen the power has been here
[23:54] god the word of god has never lost its
[23:57] power
[23:59] the power in god's word is laying there
[24:03] what's been the problem
[24:04] man
[24:06] me and you
[24:07] brother brown said god's waiting on you
[24:09] and i adoption time when god can pour in
[24:11] his fullness that's the direct quote
[24:13] we'll get to maybe a couple of weeks but
[24:15] he's going to pour it into us he wants
[24:17] to do it he's waiting on us though to
[24:19] come to a place that we will not wreck
[24:22] the car
[24:24] car's there
[24:25] gas is in it
[24:28] keys in the hand
[24:30] but you got to come to a place to where
[24:32] you're able to drive the car
[24:34] and god's going to help us to get to the
[24:36] place that we're going to be able to
[24:38] drive this vehicle
[24:39] where we have not been able to listen
[24:41] pentecost were babies they didn't know
[24:43] how to drive the car god was not god
[24:44] give him a little bit he gave him gifts
[24:47] never took gifts out we've got gifts
[24:50] of speaking in tongues and healing and
[24:51] all the different things we we don't use
[24:53] them a lot
[24:54] but we have them and that's our whose
[24:56] fault is that
[24:58] that's our fault it's not god's fault
[25:00] because i don't want you to get locked
[25:02] in your mind that that god that by the
[25:04] way you're just telling us we we we're
[25:06] preda and adoption is all we got no
[25:09] listen martin luther didn't just preach
[25:11] to just y'all left by faith every sermon
[25:14] noah didn't preach it's gonna rain for
[25:16] 120 years and that was his whole topic
[25:20] luther's either but he he got that part
[25:23] and that part was quickened to martin
[25:25] luther so that he could take it to a
[25:27] group of people and it could be
[25:29] quickened to that group of people
[25:31] in the time frame that they're in
[25:34] wesley the same way pentecost the same
[25:36] way then you've got brother branham
[25:38] coming and calling those pentecostals
[25:40] out to something higher
[25:42] something more
[25:44] old pentecost you're looking for
[25:46] something that's already passed
[25:48] you know what he said you're looking for
[25:49] this great something that's already here
[25:52] they were looking for a prophet they
[25:53] were looking for somebody to
[25:55] turn the turn the um i guess you say
[25:58] denominational world upside down but
[25:59] what happened
[26:01] they denominated
[26:02] and they died
[26:04] and when they denominated and died god's
[26:06] not gonna stand still he just moved
[26:07] right on and he had a predetermined
[26:09] predestinated group of people
[26:11] that's going to be able to take this
[26:14] and take it to the coming of the lord we
[26:16] were talking this morning about
[26:17] predestination we we talk about that a
[26:19] lot and
[26:20] i we've been taught here for years and
[26:22] years and years
[26:24] the correct way i believe a
[26:25] predestination
[26:27] is not that god pulled you through a
[26:28] tube and made you come here today made
[26:30] you get saved
[26:32] no
[26:33] he saw that you'd want it so he had it
[26:35] here for you when you got here
[26:36] by what by foreign knowledge those he
[26:38] foreign knew
[26:39] he did predestinate
[26:42] all right and i've told you before
[26:43] predestination is the journey that's
[26:45] what god saw he saw the journey of every
[26:47] man
[26:48] what a mighty god we serve where sister
[26:50] johnny at
[26:51] but a god that could see down through
[26:54] time he's standing in eternity see down
[26:56] through time and he knows what you will
[26:58] do when you got here
[27:00] ever how long it was to go
[27:02] what you would do and what you would do
[27:04] even if you didn't take this path
[27:07] if you took another path
[27:09] he knew that
[27:11] there's 7 billion people on the earth
[27:13] today i was thinking yesterday i don't
[27:15] know how many people have died since the
[27:16] beginning of time but there's probably
[27:18] more people dead than they are alive
[27:20] since the beginning of time
[27:23] god knew every one of them
[27:25] can you ever one of them he knew sharon
[27:27] rose would be a baby but when brother
[27:29] brown went across the curtain of time
[27:31] she was a young teenage girl
[27:33] that was in the mind of god that's what
[27:35] god saw so what about this god we think
[27:37] we can fool him
[27:40] we think we can fool the god that before
[27:42] the beginning of time he predestinated a
[27:45] journey
[27:46] and predestinated a group of people that
[27:47] he saw would take it and take it and
[27:49] sweep it to the coming of the lord or to
[27:51] stop
[27:53] or to stop
[27:55] pentecost stopped
[27:57] they stopped at cadence barnea brother
[27:58] brown said that's where you know that
[28:00] you come to the judgment seat katis
[28:01] bernie they come to ocadis barnea and
[28:03] what they do they turn the word down
[28:06] they believe those 10 lion preachers and
[28:08] didn't take the two preachers but guess
[28:10] what them two preachers didn't do they
[28:12] didn't quit the message
[28:14] come on brother they didn't quit the
[28:16] message
[28:17] no they stayed 40 years
[28:20] listening to that junk going on in the
[28:22] wilderness but you know the whole time
[28:24] you know what they were doing
[28:26] joshua was a warrior
[28:29] and god knew he was going to use him at
[28:30] the end and he was going to fight his
[28:32] way
[28:33] caleb same way they were fighters
[28:36] and they sat there and they what they
[28:37] trained they come to church every sunday
[28:40] they come to church they come they
[28:42] studied
[28:43] they did up for 40 years bro john 40
[28:45] years
[28:47] they basically kept silent
[28:50] there was no uprising between them two
[28:52] there was not there was not they didn't
[28:53] have an insurrection and said well we're
[28:55] going to get no they waited why they
[28:57] waded to a position
[28:59] they waited to a time that
[29:02] there the promised land was moses takes
[29:05] joshua up on the mountain and he said
[29:07] joshua
[29:08] you're going to lead them over i can't
[29:10] take them i'm going to have to stay here
[29:11] i'm going to have to pass away
[29:13] but i can see the promised land i can
[29:15] tell you about it but you're the one
[29:16] that's going to take the promised land
[29:18] and then what a consolation that in the
[29:20] first book of joshua and i didn't bring
[29:22] it with me today but
[29:24] it'd maybe for next time
[29:26] joshua
[29:28] he looks and he
[29:30] goes to this place and
[29:31] moses said
[29:33] you're going to take over i'm leaving
[29:36] and then joshua immediately meets god
[29:40] and said joshua you saw everything moses
[29:42] did didn't you because he was pretty
[29:44] much there the whole time
[29:46] joshua said yeah i saw everything he did
[29:49] he said you're going to do the same
[29:50] thing
[29:51] he said i'm going to be with you just
[29:52] like i was with joshua i mean with moses
[29:55] wherever your feet are that's your
[29:56] possession whatever you say that's
[29:58] what's going to happen and you'll never
[30:00] lose a battle listen we'll never lose a
[30:02] battle until sin comes into the camp
[30:05] amen
[30:07] i think we kind of touched on that the
[30:08] other day you know brother brown said
[30:10] and i'll read it here in just a few
[30:11] minutes where brother brown said give me
[30:13] a church you know get everybody in order
[30:16] get everybody in position he said
[30:18] there's no telling what will happen
[30:20] think about what brother branham did
[30:22] bless his heart he would go to a place
[30:24] and there'd be there'd be um
[30:27] all kind of demons and all kind of
[30:28] denominations and everything
[30:31] whirling around in the in the room and
[30:33] and it didn't bother him one bit because
[30:36] you know what he had a position he knew
[30:37] where he stood
[30:38] god gave him a commission just like he
[30:40] gave moses a commission
[30:44] get the people to believe you and
[30:46] nothing will stand in your way
[30:48] joshua get the people to believe you and
[30:50] nothing's going to stand in your way
[30:53] well they believed him all but one guy
[30:54] aiken thought he could just take a
[30:56] little bit of extra
[30:57] and keep it for himself
[30:59] a little monetary because it wasn't just
[31:01] a
[31:02] rock
[31:03] it was a golden wedge
[31:05] had some value to it had some monetary
[31:07] value always money women in popularity
[31:09] that's what would kill us
[31:11] but predestination is a journey
[31:12] president predestination it's the
[31:14] journey predestinated is the promise now
[31:16] that's where me and you fit in
[31:18] so let's look at this what we were
[31:19] talking about this morning let's go to
[31:21] ephesians
[31:22] 1 and go through that real quick
[31:25] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[31:27] will of god
[31:28] to the saints
[31:29] which are at ephesus
[31:31] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[31:32] that's me and you
[31:34] grace be unto you and peace from god our
[31:35] father and from the lord jesus christ
[31:37] now look this is in the mind of god
[31:38] before time blessed be the god and
[31:40] father my lord jesus christ who had
[31:42] blessed
[31:44] that was horrible blessed
[31:47] if your favorite team would have scored
[31:49] a touchdown it'd have been a lot more
[31:50] than that
[31:52] who has blessed us with all spiritual
[31:55] blessings where in heavenly places in
[31:57] christ started in heaven come down here
[32:00] according us yes what chosen us in him
[32:02] before what so here we go we're up
[32:04] before the foundation of the world in
[32:06] the mind of god absolutely you were a
[32:08] seed absolutely you were set apart god
[32:11] knew where you where he was going to
[32:13] land
[32:14] but he alone held the seed
[32:19] you didn't hold it i didn't hold it
[32:21] because we were on this side of the fall
[32:25] we're on this side of the fall we didn't
[32:27] we lost that opportunity
[32:31] adam lost the opportunity to speak and
[32:33] somebody come into existence
[32:36] oh he can move trees he could move
[32:38] mountains he could move he could name
[32:39] animals but when that fall happened it
[32:42] separated him from god so much
[32:44] to where god wasn't going to use him
[32:46] anymore to bring sons and daughters of
[32:47] god on the earth
[32:49] but yeah genesis 1 26 was before that
[32:52] thank god
[32:54] that was before that and he made himself
[32:57] a promise
[32:58] i'm going to have children
[32:59] genesis 1 26 and what
[33:02] let us make man in our own image
[33:06] created he them and bring all that stuff
[33:08] down together god was going to have a
[33:10] group of children he was going to have
[33:13] sons and daughters of god
[33:15] didn't matter what
[33:16] knowing what abraham what abraham was
[33:19] going to do knowing what adam was going
[33:21] to do he knew what everybody was going
[33:22] to do
[33:24] i mean my what about a god that said
[33:26] moses you're going to bring those people
[33:28] out with a mighty hand you would think
[33:30] those and they shouted and they praised
[33:32] the lord they ate manna their clothes
[33:34] didn't fall off their body they had
[33:36] water beside them all the time
[33:38] they had all the all the pleasures of
[33:40] god
[33:41] right there among the camp
[33:43] and not a one of them made it
[33:46] two people
[33:47] but god just did just like he did me and
[33:50] you when we were in the world of sin he
[33:51] was just waiting
[33:54] he knew the predestination of each one
[33:57] of us
[33:58] so therefore he could
[34:00] set up destiny for me and you
[34:03] and give us a promise that when we got
[34:05] to the end of it this is what it's going
[34:06] to be
[34:07] same way the children of israel i'm
[34:08] going to promise you a promised land
[34:10] now
[34:11] they could have all made it
[34:14] they could all mate if they had to come
[34:15] catus bernie and those other 10 lion
[34:17] preachers didn't get out of the message
[34:22] they saw something different from
[34:24] everybody else
[34:26] ten of them
[34:28] god never is and uh he
[34:30] i say odd
[34:31] god is never an odds
[34:34] person
[34:36] everybody got that
[34:38] you know vegas and all these people they
[34:40] got odds just you know 47 percent you're
[34:42] gonna do this and twenty percent you're
[34:43] gonna god never has he never hasn't even
[34:45] watched for that he'll take one man and
[34:47] destroy the world with it
[34:49] he'll state one man moses and destroy a
[34:51] nation just like the united states of
[34:53] america
[34:54] odds doesn't bother him a bit
[34:57] a thousand people i've always wondered
[34:59] how
[35:00] samson i know he was brother brown said
[35:02] he wasn't now an arnold schwarzenegger
[35:05] he wasn't this great big muscular guy he
[35:07] called him a little a little uh what was
[35:10] it a seven lock
[35:11] a mama's boy
[35:14] a pretty boy is what he was because he
[35:15] got all the girls but he had those
[35:17] little seven locks and he wasn't no
[35:18] great big because they wondered why why
[35:20] were you getting their strength from
[35:22] well it wouldn't have been very bad if
[35:24] it had been somebody like arnold
[35:25] schwarzenegger that could lift a
[35:26] thousand pounds
[35:28] it wouldn't be a mystery but somebody
[35:29] like
[35:30] you know like me or
[35:32] or some of y'all that's skinny and you
[35:37] what are you laughing for
[35:40] but he walks out there and he takes a
[35:41] jawbone of an animal
[35:43] and kills a thousand
[35:45] veteran warriors
[35:47] they weren't just people they picked up
[35:49] on the side of the road no these were
[35:51] philistines that probably fought since
[35:52] they were a little kid what god got a
[35:54] hold of him
[35:56] what are you talking about brother let
[35:57] god get a hold of you
[35:59] when you get in your position listen
[36:01] samson knew who he was as long brother
[36:03] brown said as long as he could reach
[36:05] back here oh come on somebody
[36:08] as long as he could reach back here and
[36:10] feel those locks he knew god was with
[36:12] him
[36:13] because remember the first thing when he
[36:14] woke up when delilah shaved his head he
[36:16] reached back
[36:18] and they weren't there
[36:20] he had lost all of his strength what he
[36:22] had come out from under the promise
[36:24] he came out from the promise of god and
[36:26] god
[36:27] let him put his eyes out but guess what
[36:29] he got the victory at the end
[36:32] but this all being in the mind of god
[36:34] according to his chosen us and him i'll
[36:37] read that because you all don't have to
[36:39] say us because
[36:40] somebody already asleep
[36:42] according as he has chosen us i'll do it
[36:44] for you in him before the foundation of
[36:46] the world that we should be holy and
[36:48] without blame look what he saw
[36:51] this is what god saw that you would be
[36:54] holy and without blame we blame
[36:56] ourselves all day long
[36:58] god never blames you at all
[37:02] well i'm pointing up there point by here
[37:05] that we should be holy and without blame
[37:07] before him in love what because he
[37:09] predestinated us
[37:12] saul what we would do saw that if we did
[37:14] do something wrong i was reading
[37:15] yesterday brother brown said the
[37:17] difference in a sinner and a christian a
[37:19] christian has sins
[37:22] a sinner's just a sinner
[37:24] but christians has multiple sins
[37:27] he said but god knows as soon as you do
[37:28] it you're going to ask forgiveness
[37:30] and he will forgive you
[37:32] amen now he's not a dodeo granddaddy
[37:35] he's not going to let you get by with it
[37:36] a bunch of times don't start that
[37:38] business with me
[37:40] hey man
[37:43] child training
[37:45] if you keep hitting your finger if you
[37:47] keep hitting your fingernail with a
[37:48] hammer do what move your finger
[37:52] really simple
[37:54] like i said this morning i i want you to
[37:56] see that
[37:59] we cause our own trouble
[38:01] i had somebody tell me the other day he
[38:04] said um
[38:06] oh i talked to greg salyer about you the
[38:07] other day i apologize
[38:09] so
[38:12] he was at the honey store but anyway
[38:14] what was i going to say oh there was
[38:16] somebody said i was talking to somebody
[38:18] and said say well they've ruined my
[38:20] career they've run my political career
[38:22] they've ruined my something and i
[38:24] thought no there is not a man ruined
[38:27] this ruin that somebody else has ruined
[38:29] me
[38:31] no man has ruined me
[38:34] who ruined me
[38:35] me
[38:36] who ruined you you
[38:38] you said why if that preacher would
[38:40] preach something different
[38:41] why don't you start praying differently
[38:46] why don't you start praying different
[38:48] but you don't run you don't ruin people
[38:51] people ruin their self
[38:53] that's our problem we blame the pastor
[38:55] blame brother branham for this and
[38:57] blame this for we even blame the devil
[38:59] for a lot of stuff like what daddy
[39:01] always tell us
[39:02] it ain't always the devil's fault
[39:04] it's yours
[39:06] the devil made me do it who was that
[39:08] said that um
[39:10] oh what was that guy's name
[39:12] flit wilson yeah the devil made me do it
[39:14] no the devil didn't make him do a lot of
[39:15] that
[39:16] because he didn't have god is the reason
[39:18] he did a lot of that that's the same way
[39:20] with me and you even going up the statue
[39:21] of perfect man we're going to get to a
[39:22] little bit later because see at the new
[39:24] birth as we were talking about this
[39:25] morning
[39:26] look how wide that is
[39:29] god gives you some leeway when you're
[39:31] first born again and you're a baby
[39:33] he gives you a wide base to work off of
[39:36] but watch what happens as it goes higher
[39:40] what he stuff starts being shaved off
[39:43] it's not a box
[39:45] it don't just keep going like this
[39:48] it's honed
[39:50] with it
[39:51] you're gonna need a lot more faith but
[39:53] you're gonna need some brotherly
[39:54] kindness too
[39:55] where god is going to what hone you
[39:58] and shape you if you'll let him
[40:01] if you don't let him brother brown said
[40:03] just like he said he's a child as a
[40:04] child
[40:05] when you're born again you're a child
[40:07] you can misbehave but you know what you
[40:09] remember the uh
[40:10] story of the what was it brother ramsay
[40:12] that brother brown met
[40:14] but he told brother branham he said i'm
[40:16] not preaching no more i'm done i'm
[40:17] finished he went and got some beer and
[40:19] started drinking and six months later
[40:21] the prophet of god said
[40:22] he died he said god took his servant
[40:25] home so he wouldn't marry his name
[40:28] amen
[40:31] god's not gonna
[40:34] god's not gonna let that happen
[40:36] he'll let it happen a time or two but
[40:38] you keep misbehaving you're going off
[40:40] the scene
[40:42] if you're a child of god if you're not
[40:43] he's not he's not obligated to but he's
[40:46] obligated to his children so once you
[40:48] are a child of god he does have some
[40:49] obligation
[40:51] you and i have obligation to our kids
[40:52] even though they may be you know
[40:55] 50 years old donny don't look at me
[40:58] accordingly he has chosen us in him
[41:00] before the foundation of the world that
[41:02] we should be holding without blame
[41:03] before him in love having predestinated
[41:05] us what look at the journey saw what we
[41:08] wanted saw where we were going to be
[41:10] having predestinated us unto the
[41:13] adoption of children by jesus christ
[41:14] what to himself
[41:16] according to the good pleasure of his
[41:18] will and his will is his word to the
[41:20] praise of the glory of his grace when he
[41:21] has made us accepted and the beloved who
[41:24] is the beloved jesus christ
[41:26] remember we talked about heirs and joint
[41:28] heirs all right now we got to come down
[41:30] here the earth to see the redemption we
[41:32] know that it was in heaven we know that
[41:34] it was the mind of god listen we didn't
[41:36] know anything about a mind of god how
[41:37] many people have you heard talk about
[41:39] the mind of god
[41:41] in the denominational world or even
[41:43] most a lot of message believers
[41:46] brother brown said let's let's go back
[41:49] into the back part of god's mind
[41:52] let's go back he was opening up what the
[41:54] seals were open yes when he preached
[41:56] across the mystery guard reveal the
[41:58] seals were open and when he opened the
[41:59] seals he opened up the mind of god there
[42:01] was a portal open where he could walk
[42:03] into the end of the mind of god and
[42:05] understand why god did this and why god
[42:07] did that
[42:09] so will me and you
[42:11] that's why the seals are so important
[42:13] folks people get scared of them things
[42:14] i'm not scared of them
[42:17] i'm not scared of them because you know
[42:19] what they're to me
[42:21] that's my promise that's my
[42:22] predestinated promise that's my
[42:24] inheritance
[42:25] and that's my inheritance here
[42:28] we know we're going to get an
[42:29] inheritance there but i want my
[42:31] inheritance now
[42:34] we which are alive and remain shall not
[42:36] what prevent or hinder those which are
[42:37] asleep for the trumpet of god shall sign
[42:40] then christ your rights first
[42:42] and we which are alive and remain shall
[42:44] be called up we
[42:46] which are alive
[42:48] and remain
[42:50] can you believe that
[42:52] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[42:54] when he hath made us accepted in the
[42:55] beloved all right so now we've got to
[42:57] get to earth redemption in whom we have
[42:58] redemption through his blood he had to
[43:00] die down here
[43:02] on a cross the forgiveness of sins
[43:04] according to the riches of his grace
[43:06] wherein he has abounded i like that word
[43:09] abounded heaped on toward us in all
[43:11] wisdom and prudence now that's to me
[43:13] that's going up the statue of a perfect
[43:14] man
[43:15] a kid doesn't have wisdom and prudence
[43:20] no but an adult does
[43:23] well some
[43:24] some
[43:25] haven't made a known to us but look what
[43:28] he's doing he's not just bringing us
[43:29] somewhere he's given us something
[43:33] having made known unto us the mystery of
[43:36] his will
[43:38] according to his good pleasure which he
[43:39] had purposed in himself that in the
[43:41] dispensation what we were talking about
[43:43] dispensations the other week in the
[43:45] dispensation of the fullness of times
[43:47] this is the time when it all comes
[43:49] together
[43:51] this is the time when for the gentile
[43:53] church this is the time when it all
[43:55] comes together paul had his part arenas
[43:57] martin columba luther wesley pentecost
[44:01] but now in this end time this is the
[44:04] fullness of times because we can look
[44:05] back and see everything the seals are
[44:07] open books open mysteries have been
[44:09] revealed
[44:11] and what are we doing with it
[44:14] that's my question what are we doing
[44:15] with it
[44:16] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[44:18] of times he might gather together in one
[44:22] not in four
[44:24] or 20 different doctrines
[44:28] everybody gets quiet when you start
[44:29] talking about doctrine
[44:31] but i'm reading you right here that he
[44:33] might gather together in one
[44:38] amen
[44:40] all things in christ
[44:42] both which are in heaven
[44:44] and which are on earth
[44:46] even in him in whom also we have
[44:48] obtained an inheritance you're going to
[44:50] fight for every inch of this one
[44:52] you're going to fight for every inch
[44:54] because you know what it's holding time
[44:55] it's time that god's going to hone you
[44:56] off and what sharpens steel steel
[45:01] steel sharpened
[45:02] steel two-edged sword and whom we also
[45:05] have obtained an inheritance why what
[45:08] our inheritance being predestinated
[45:10] according to the purpose of him who
[45:11] worketh all things after the council of
[45:13] his own will
[45:14] that would be his word that we should be
[45:16] to the praise of his glory who first
[45:17] trusted in christ and whom you also
[45:19] trusted after
[45:22] you heard the word of truth
[45:24] the gospel of your salvation
[45:27] and him also
[45:28] after
[45:29] that you believed
[45:31] how you gonna receive something if you
[45:32] don't believe you got it or it's there
[45:34] for you
[45:37] every promise in the book is mine
[45:39] every chapter every verse every line
[45:42] right
[45:44] and whom also that you
[45:46] after you believed you were sealed with
[45:48] that holy spirit of promise
[45:50] all right so now that's your journey on
[45:52] earth
[45:54] and look which is the earnest now we
[45:56] know the promise we we look at the
[45:57] earnest of our inheritance and what is
[46:00] the earnest prophet of god tells us it's
[46:01] a down payment
[46:03] you go buy a car you go buy a house
[46:06] now you go buy a tank of gas
[46:11] you know you see that on facebook the
[46:13] other day the guy said said praise the
[46:15] lord i got my loan i can get a full tank
[46:17] of gas now
[46:20] but that's a down payment
[46:22] but now if you if you if you keep
[46:26] with the paperwork
[46:29] yeah if you stay with the paperwork
[46:32] that down payment's gonna turn into you
[46:34] on the net
[46:36] come on somebody
[46:41] you got an earnest
[46:43] but inside of here lays your full
[46:45] redemption but what are you going to do
[46:46] about it if you keep the book closed
[46:51] it's like a puzzle
[46:53] it's like a puzzle
[46:54] you got this over here you got this part
[46:56] over here and remember brother brian
[46:58] said it's like a puzzle he said but the
[47:00] problem with some people is they've got
[47:02] the puzzle but they've got the cow up in
[47:04] the top of the tree
[47:06] eating grass when he should be down on
[47:08] the grass eating grass they got the
[47:10] right picture
[47:11] they got the right pieces
[47:13] and if you like if you've ever watched
[47:15] my daddy put together a puzzle if it
[47:16] don't fit he gets his knife out
[47:21] it'll fit now
[47:22] but it ain't supposed to go there but
[47:24] it'll fit
[47:26] but that's not the way god is he's got a
[47:28] picture
[47:29] and that picture is for me and you to
[47:31] what that picture before the foundation
[47:34] of the world that's what we got to match
[47:35] to
[47:36] hey man
[47:38] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[47:40] until the redemption of the purchased
[47:42] possession
[47:43] what was the purchase of possession
[47:44] remember at calvary the prophet of god
[47:46] at calvary jesus paid the whole price
[47:51] he even redeemed your body
[47:54] at calvary
[47:56] when his blood dropped on the earth
[47:57] where was your body your body was in
[48:00] this earth
[48:02] where do you think your body come from
[48:03] 16 elements of the ground potash
[48:07] calcium and all those different minerals
[48:09] your body was it brother brown said god
[48:12] paid the price
[48:14] claimed your body
[48:17] but remember it's not been applied yet
[48:20] see even even even claimed israel
[48:23] he claimed everybody at calvary but it
[48:25] hasn't been applied yet because
[48:27] it won't be applied to the jews until
[48:29] what their dispensation starts
[48:31] after we leave out of here but we're in
[48:33] the dispensation now puzzle gentiles
[48:35] we're in that dispensation last church
[48:38] age
[48:39] last church age we're in that
[48:40] dispensation
[48:42] we're getting preached the message not
[48:44] just to get born again it's going
[48:46] further than that that's our
[48:48] dispensation we've got a earnest of our
[48:51] inheritance which is the new birth if
[48:52] you're sitting here today that new birth
[48:54] is turning
[48:56] that new birth is turning brother brown
[48:58] said it's like a button
[49:01] man like a button when you receive the
[49:03] new birth he says like a button he said
[49:04] it goes in you
[49:06] and it grows
[49:09] it grows
[49:11] it doesn't stay baby
[49:13] it
[49:14] grows so the future what and i say
[49:17] future
[49:18] it should be now
[49:20] we've got the earnest
[49:22] and we're looking and preaching now all
[49:24] of us are trying to get us to see the
[49:25] purchased possession that he's already
[49:27] purchased
[49:28] it satan is just trying to get you to
[49:31] believe it it's not you
[49:33] amen he's trying to get you to believe
[49:35] right now that it's not you you're not
[49:37] worthy of it
[49:39] well you know what
[49:42] you're not in the human state you're in
[49:44] but i thought we were looking back to
[49:46] what god had already chosen before the
[49:47] foundation of the world
[49:50] before the foundation of the world
[49:53] swallowed you know you
[49:54] we had a man walk among us that knew
[49:56] some stuff when brother dale walked up
[49:59] there in jeffersonville and they were
[50:01] talking about redemption being over
[50:03] in 1963 when the seals opened this was
[50:05] about 1968 or 69 when we come into
[50:07] message we go to jeffersonville a couple
[50:09] times a year
[50:12] and they were talking about redemption
[50:13] being over
[50:15] after the seals were preached and there
[50:16] was no need to
[50:18] you know seek salvation because
[50:20] redemption was already over the lamb was
[50:22] off the mercy seat and brother brown
[50:23] quotes that
[50:26] but it didn't happen right then
[50:28] we know that it happens when everybody's
[50:30] in that's what he tells us
[50:34] but brother dale told him said well
[50:35] y'all fighting over where it was over in
[50:37] 1963's and my bible says redemption was
[50:39] over before the foundation of the world
[50:41] what are you all arguing about
[50:47] thank god for some wisdom
[50:50] but that was the kind of silly stuff
[50:51] that you you don't have to fight it you
[50:53] just give them a quote say look it was
[50:54] done before the foundation of the world
[50:55] well you worried about what time it was
[50:56] in 1963 or whenever
[50:58] i know it wasn't because about 90
[51:03] about 99 of y'all
[51:07] well about 80 of you all weren't even
[51:09] born
[51:10] in 1963
[51:12] and the rest of us were doing other
[51:14] things that we shouldn't have been doing
[51:16] amen
[51:18] so he wasn't talking redemption wasn't
[51:19] over for us so we just need to all go
[51:20] the house
[51:22] none of you saved y'all lost
[51:25] maybe maybe sister cleveland
[51:30] and daddy maybe
[51:32] but the rest of us are just lost can you
[51:34] see how silly that is why the world
[51:36] would you even have church
[51:38] why struggle
[51:39] why struggle to do anything if
[51:41] everything's over with and done because
[51:43] i thought that's what's going to happen
[51:44] when everything's over and done
[51:46] no struggling no strife
[51:49] we don't we don't have to when we get in
[51:51] the millennium you're not going to have
[51:52] to struggle
[51:53] my it's all be over
[51:57] well i thought that'd have stirred you
[51:58] up a little bit but some of y'all don't
[52:00] know if it's over or not i don't know
[52:02] when you go to the land of nod
[52:06] that's where cain was
[52:08] amen thank you brother
[52:10] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[52:12] until the redemption of the purchase
[52:14] possession of the praise
[52:15] of whose glory
[52:17] his glory
[52:18] all right galatians four verse one
[52:21] we're still talking about this there
[52:22] because we do have something now i say
[52:25] that the heir as long as he's a child
[52:26] different nothing from a servant though
[52:27] it'd be lord of all
[52:30] god a possession
[52:31] everybody with me got a possession
[52:33] though he be lord of all though he's
[52:35] going to clean the toilets in the
[52:36] bathroom
[52:38] because you got to learn somewhere
[52:41] amen
[52:42] but he's under tutors and governors
[52:43] until the time appointed of the father
[52:46] that's why we've been here 57 58 60
[52:48] years since the prophet left the scene
[52:51] we haven't been listening to our tutors
[52:53] and governors
[52:54] but there is somebody going to listen to
[52:56] him
[52:57] there is going to be a star student
[53:01] some of y'all used to hate them people
[53:04] because you never was one
[53:07] star student nobody liked them why they
[53:09] were different
[53:11] they were different they acted different
[53:13] they had a different mentality
[53:15] they were smart
[53:17] they made some other left too
[53:20] but as under tutors and governors of the
[53:21] time appointed to the father
[53:23] let's continue on number one we talk
[53:25] about now
[53:26] teaching i want to
[53:28] we harp on this a lot but
[53:31] do we not want to know positionally
[53:32] where we are
[53:33] and then i read your quote the other day
[53:35] where a church is settled if they have
[53:36] good teaching why in the world wouldn't
[53:38] you want to have something settled
[53:40] especially in this world why because you
[53:42] know what teaching does teaching is
[53:45] prophetic
[53:47] teaching is prophetic it tells you all
[53:49] right it tells you it puts everything in
[53:51] place right here knowing that whatever
[53:53] is going to happen over here you know it
[53:56] already here
[53:57] you already know the battle is this
[54:00] going to go this way if you have good
[54:02] teaching
[54:03] so you don't have to worry about this
[54:05] over here on this side because you've
[54:07] already been taught it over here
[54:08] amen got like calculus if you've been
[54:11] taught calculus it's whatever grade they
[54:13] start and calculus now probably third
[54:15] grade but not when i was going to school
[54:17] but uh
[54:19] why would you be feared of taking a
[54:21] calculus
[54:22] uh course in college if you'd had
[54:24] calculus for the 12 years you was in
[54:25] school
[54:27] you've been taught right so don't worry
[54:29] about the calculus that you're going to
[54:30] take in college it's just a little more
[54:32] you may have to study a little more
[54:35] but teaching places a man positionally
[54:37] what he is and we can never rightly be
[54:40] able to have faith
[54:42] oh i'm sorry everybody believe brother
[54:44] brown was the prophet
[54:45] amen we believe what he said all right
[54:48] we can never rightly be able to have
[54:50] faith until positionally we know what we
[54:53] are
[54:56] i want to know who i am do you want to
[54:58] know who you are
[55:00] good or bad
[55:02] because once you know who you are
[55:04] you can do something about it one way or
[55:06] the other
[55:07] good or bad
[55:11] deception
[55:12] is going to kill a lot of people
[55:15] satan's going to tell you you're all
[55:16] right everything's fine you go to church
[55:19] you believe
[55:22] so did judas
[55:24] judas actually preached
[55:26] you know we see these people falling
[55:28] away from the message
[55:29] it's really not it shouldn't surprise us
[55:33] judas
[55:35] betrayed jesus and he stood right there
[55:37] and cast out devils
[55:39] he did mighty works in the name of the
[55:40] lord
[55:41] and he betrayed jesus sitting right
[55:44] there with him that night and jesus even
[55:46] washed his feet at the supper at the
[55:48] last supper
[55:50] knowing who he was
[55:53] that was the son of man folks
[55:55] that was the son of man being displayed
[55:57] and that's what about me and you
[55:59] same thing
[56:00] adoption series 1960. the prophet who
[56:03] said you said your adoption
[56:05] is not your birth your adoption is your
[56:07] placing
[56:08] so that what we're going to talk about
[56:09] next uh two sundays from now is the
[56:11] place and we'll get to it look down at
[56:13] the very bottom adoption is placing a
[56:16] sun it's not
[56:18] saving a sun
[56:20] it's not putting the sun in the body
[56:22] it's not making any mares and joint
[56:24] hairs
[56:26] he got that at his birth
[56:28] when he got born into the body you can't
[56:29] take him out of the body
[56:31] he's got to stay in the body good or bad
[56:34] prodigal son was a son
[56:39] adoption is placing
[56:41] of a son
[56:43] all right let's continue on now look at
[56:44] the three stages we were talking about
[56:45] this morning
[56:47] the first stage of adoption is the birth
[56:48] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[56:50] god they are the sons of god
[56:53] it's hard for us to see though
[56:57] it's hard for people to see that once
[56:59] you get born again that just begins your
[57:02] journey
[57:04] that just begins your life in christ
[57:08] because but as human beings though what
[57:10] do we do
[57:12] we get to the finish line
[57:14] and what do you p you see runners it's
[57:16] running 25 and 30 miles what's the first
[57:18] thing they do when you get to the finish
[57:19] line they don't keep on running
[57:21] they fall down on the ground
[57:23] they're exhausted
[57:25] that's not with god when you get to the
[57:26] finish line and get the new birth you've
[57:28] got another race to go
[57:31] now you can lay there if you want to
[57:34] and the devil will run all over you
[57:36] but you can get up and run the next race
[57:38] which is an option which is the placing
[57:40] which is putting you in position of god
[57:44] that's what god wants
[57:46] god's not seen that
[57:47] except a few times on his face of this
[57:49] earth
[57:50] that people were
[57:51] people were positionally placed where
[57:53] they're supposed to be
[57:54] with the full power and authority of god
[57:56] it happened in jesus it happened in
[57:58] william branham and it happened in adam
[58:01] to a degree
[58:03] three people
[58:06] and then seven billion people in the
[58:07] world now
[58:09] how many of us are in that position
[58:11] that's why we're still here
[58:14] but we've seen it in part
[58:17] several times
[58:19] listen let's don't wait till we need it
[58:21] to get it
[58:24] let's don't wait till we need it to get
[58:26] it
[58:27] we need to get it before we need it
[58:30] amen
[58:31] that's what we're trying to do now for
[58:32] as many are led by the spirit of god
[58:34] they are the sons of god for you have
[58:35] not received the spirit of bondage again
[58:37] to fear but you have received the spirit
[58:39] of adoption whereby we cry
[58:41] have a father the spirit itself bearing
[58:43] witness with our spirit what that we're
[58:45] going to be
[58:51] they don't say that
[58:53] that we are
[58:54] the children of god
[58:56] and if a child then heirs and heirs of
[58:58] god join heirs with christ if beast
[59:00] though we suffer with him that women may
[59:01] be also glorified
[59:03] together
[59:04] all right read ii peter simon peter
[59:06] servant apostle of jesus christ to them
[59:08] that have what have obtained
[59:10] like precious faith with us through the
[59:12] righteousness of god and our savior
[59:14] jesus christ
[59:15] and then look we go down to verse five
[59:17] it says besides this what beside
[59:19] receiving the divine nature beside being
[59:22] put into the family of god give all
[59:24] diligence to add
[59:27] add to your faith virtue and your virtue
[59:30] knowledge and all this temperament ah
[59:31] these are added
[59:33] if we would have just read that
[59:35] in the scripture we wouldn't have needed
[59:36] a prophet to tell us we needed adam
[59:41] sorry it was already in black and white
[59:43] in the bible
[59:44] hidden in there
[59:46] it took a prophet though to shine the
[59:48] light on it
[59:50] and say these are required it says add
[59:53] it didn't say you already got
[59:57] then peter said to them repent every one
[1:00:00] of you and be baptized in the name of
[1:00:02] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:00:04] have we done that
[1:00:07] if we hadn't you you're you're falling
[1:00:09] behind
[1:00:11] right
[1:00:12] you falling behind peter said repent
[1:00:15] and be baptized everywhere in the name
[1:00:16] of jesus christ for the remission of
[1:00:17] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:00:20] the holy ghost
[1:00:21] for the promise what's the promise
[1:00:23] you'll receive the holy ghost
[1:00:25] isn't to you and to your children and
[1:00:26] all that are far off even as many as the
[1:00:28] lord our god shall
[1:00:30] call that's me and you
[1:00:32] are we good
[1:00:35] let's go to number three
[1:00:38] questions and answers
[1:00:40] he's talking about the this morning
[1:00:42] through luther and wesley let's read the
[1:00:44] red the promise is the baptism of the
[1:00:46] spirit which is promised all through the
[1:00:48] old testament do you all know what was
[1:00:49] promised to the old testament to
[1:00:52] the new birth is promised through the
[1:00:53] old testament but it never was applied
[1:00:57] until the day of pentecost
[1:00:59] there was no new birth in the old
[1:01:00] testament
[1:01:02] there's no bride in the old testament
[1:01:03] there was a bride potential bride but
[1:01:06] she went
[1:01:07] she went horn and god had to put her
[1:01:09] away now is that right
[1:01:11] israel israel was supposed to be god's
[1:01:13] first bride
[1:01:14] i know some of you got that furrowed
[1:01:15] look again
[1:01:18] that's okay
[1:01:19] you're thinking at least you're not
[1:01:26] i'm hoping to fly one day
[1:01:30] the promises of baptism of the holy
[1:01:32] spirit which is promised all to the old
[1:01:34] testament listen what did jesus christ
[1:01:35] walk out on
[1:01:37] the promises of the old testament
[1:01:40] if you can't see christ in every verse
[1:01:42] go and read it again brother didn't say
[1:01:44] that was new testament
[1:01:46] if you can't see christ in every verse
[1:01:48] what we're talking about the children of
[1:01:49] israel that is the walk of a christian
[1:01:53] circumcision by joshua this morning that
[1:01:56] was the new birth that spoke of
[1:01:59] getting rid of the old man getting rid
[1:02:01] of the foreskin
[1:02:04] so that god could be made known
[1:02:06] the promise is the baptism of the holy
[1:02:07] spirit which is promised all through the
[1:02:09] old testament and new too
[1:02:13] now i want you to understand one more
[1:02:14] time before we get go to this
[1:02:17] that in the old testament
[1:02:19] they were covered under bulls and goats
[1:02:21] right
[1:02:22] the blood of jesus christ takes away sin
[1:02:26] blood of bulls and goats only covers
[1:02:30] capo covers your sin so there's no way
[1:02:32] you can get the new birth in the old
[1:02:34] testament
[1:02:35] the new birth is the life of god
[1:02:39] inside of you like we talked about this
[1:02:41] morning the vulcanizing to getting rid
[1:02:42] of the old person moses couldn't get rid
[1:02:45] of the old guy
[1:02:47] david couldn't get rid of the old guy
[1:02:48] david didn't have the new birth he
[1:02:50] killed the guy committed adultery with
[1:02:52] his wife
[1:02:54] pretty rotten
[1:02:57] but he'll be saved
[1:03:00] see there's a difference in being saved
[1:03:01] and having a new birth
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:05] you ought to know that already you've
[1:03:07] been taught long enough
[1:03:09] the promise behold i'll send the promise
[1:03:11] of my father upon you peter said on the
[1:03:13] day of pentecost that is the promise the
[1:03:15] promised land
[1:03:17] is to
[1:03:18] live in this land of the holy spirit
[1:03:20] that's god's promise to the church is to
[1:03:22] live in the power of the spirit
[1:03:24] it's another world
[1:03:26] it's another land
[1:03:28] you have to come out of the conditions
[1:03:30] you've been in
[1:03:31] i pray today that we pray today
[1:03:34] that we get out of the conditions that
[1:03:35] we're in you say brother wait i've been
[1:03:37] in the message for 40 years
[1:03:38] well it's kind of like the guy
[1:03:40] was talking to another man the man
[1:03:42] walked up and said brother said how long
[1:03:44] you been in how long you been a
[1:03:45] christian
[1:03:46] and that brother said oh brother said
[1:03:47] i've been in the way about 40 years that
[1:03:50] man said that's your problem brother
[1:03:51] you've been in the way
[1:03:55] y'all get it sometime tomorrow maybe
[1:03:59] you have to be careful what you say
[1:04:00] about the way
[1:04:01] you can get in the way or you can get in
[1:04:04] the way
[1:04:05] okay
[1:04:06] you have to come out of the conditions
[1:04:08] that you've been in how many people are
[1:04:10] satisfied with where they at right now
[1:04:12] why mine i just did it for illustration
[1:04:14] purposes i'm not
[1:04:17] okay then what's our problem
[1:04:24] that's why that's why there's a call in
[1:04:26] the end time for the ministry to preach
[1:04:29] or teach to people how to get out of all
[1:04:31] that stuff how to change their condition
[1:04:34] how to get a what a new birth
[1:04:37] from according to malachi 4.
[1:04:42] to come out to live in this promised
[1:04:45] land to receive
[1:04:47] the promise let's continue on number
[1:04:48] four
[1:04:50] adoption series brother ryan said look
[1:04:52] now remember god predestinated you by
[1:04:54] foreknowledge
[1:04:56] that you were coming to this what he saw
[1:05:00] for knowledge he saw you coming
[1:05:04] to this everybody understand that raise
[1:05:06] their hand see god by foreknowledge
[1:05:09] predestinated you to come to the
[1:05:10] promised land what is the promised land
[1:05:12] for the christian today just raise up
[1:05:14] your hand if you know the promise is
[1:05:16] what unto you you chill what's the
[1:05:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:19] all right let's go to genesis 17. this
[1:05:21] is where he was at this morning
[1:05:23] talking about circumcision and he that
[1:05:25] is eight days old shall be circumcised
[1:05:27] you know jesus was even circumcised
[1:05:29] on the eighth day
[1:05:32] eight why why not the seventh
[1:05:34] why not the six
[1:05:36] eighth day
[1:05:37] showing that it's in eternity when you
[1:05:39] get into the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:41] when you receive the new birth you step
[1:05:43] over into eternity that's why i said it
[1:05:44] we don't really realize when we get the
[1:05:46] new birth what all we get
[1:05:50] we just want an emotion we just want to
[1:05:51] shout we just want to uh uh like i said
[1:05:54] a laundry list of things well well i
[1:05:56] shouted i spoke in tongues i quit doing
[1:05:57] this you should have done that it's
[1:05:59] sanctification
[1:06:02] i'm sorry the unclean spirit goes out of
[1:06:04] sanctification it don't go after the new
[1:06:05] birth
[1:06:08] if you let it back in it probably needs
[1:06:10] to go out to the new birth but
[1:06:12] you don't need to quit you need we need
[1:06:13] to quit that stuff and i did
[1:06:16] i quit that stuff at sanctification i
[1:06:18] didn't wait till i was born again
[1:06:21] i went through those stages just like
[1:06:24] the prophet tells us
[1:06:25] justified by faith
[1:06:28] went got baptized
[1:06:33] did a lot of bad things
[1:06:36] but remember justification
[1:06:39] you still got the unclean spirit
[1:06:43] all it does is chop off your past sins
[1:06:45] it puts all that in the sea of god's
[1:06:46] forgetfulness so that he don't remember
[1:06:48] it no more and he can start cleaning you
[1:06:49] up
[1:06:51] and then the unclean spirit goes out of
[1:06:52] a man in sanctification walks in dry
[1:06:54] places seeks rest finds none comes back
[1:06:56] sees what sees you in church sees you
[1:07:00] reading message books instead of what
[1:07:02] brother brown called two-story books i
[1:07:04] don't think they make them anymore
[1:07:06] all them things will the aliens marry
[1:07:07] people and have babies and all of them
[1:07:09] what is that isis i don't know what it
[1:07:11] is some
[1:07:13] magazine that you didn't read anymore
[1:07:15] after you got born again right right
[1:07:18] that's my point
[1:07:20] that's what changed you that was
[1:07:21] sanctification that was not the new
[1:07:23] birth
[1:07:24] the reason i knew i got the new birth is
[1:07:26] is when god started putting the word
[1:07:28] together for me
[1:07:31] because satan can't put the word
[1:07:33] together
[1:07:34] he will make it one word off every time
[1:07:38] he'll try to get you to believe so far
[1:07:41] oh surely you won't die
[1:07:45] you'll be his gods
[1:07:47] knowing good and evil well she was
[1:07:49] already a god she should have said i'm
[1:07:50] already a god what i need you for
[1:07:54] is that right yes
[1:07:59] he that is eight days old shall be
[1:08:00] circumcised among you every man child in
[1:08:02] your generation he that is born in a
[1:08:04] house or bought with money of any
[1:08:05] stranger which is not
[1:08:07] of thy seed
[1:08:08] then we go to joshua 5 verse 1.
[1:08:14] and it came to pass when the kings of
[1:08:15] the amorites
[1:08:17] all their mites
[1:08:20] that's what we got to get rid of all
[1:08:21] these eyes
[1:08:23] right
[1:08:25] jb sites highlights amorites websites
[1:08:28] and all the mother signs
[1:08:35] that's old
[1:08:37] that's all i heard that in the youth
[1:08:38] camp 10 years 20 years ago
[1:08:40] so anyway and that wasn't much for the
[1:08:42] internet now my internet now it's just
[1:08:46] there's nothing you can't find
[1:08:49] junit listen to this i just want to tell
[1:08:51] you how how connected how how much we
[1:08:53] think we're protected and and nobody
[1:08:56] knows where we are
[1:09:00] jen and i were looking at
[1:09:02] number one we were talking about going
[1:09:03] to alaska so we looked up one or two
[1:09:06] places about vacations in alaska
[1:09:09] then we were gonna buy a camper
[1:09:12] to go take to illinois where we hunted
[1:09:14] and we looked into several of those
[1:09:16] sites
[1:09:17] you can't get out my
[1:09:18] phone every time i turn my phone on
[1:09:21] there's a rv for sale
[1:09:24] or there's a new
[1:09:26] vacation in
[1:09:28] alaska
[1:09:30] it says learn more you just punch that
[1:09:32] and guess what
[1:09:35] they listening
[1:09:36] they watching i know all you computers
[1:09:38] know the algorithms and stuff what you
[1:09:40] put in what you look up online there's
[1:09:42] certain things that if you keep punching
[1:09:44] that same
[1:09:45] word or phrase you're going to get all
[1:09:48] you know we're beekeepers so we do the
[1:09:49] same thing when we first started
[1:09:50] beekeeping we never got an ad for
[1:09:52] beekeeping
[1:09:54] anything
[1:09:55] when we first started beekeeping started
[1:09:56] looking up beekeeping stuff
[1:09:58] we got ads from man lake and all the
[1:10:01] different beekeeping supply places we
[1:10:02] never contacted in our life
[1:10:05] they're watching
[1:10:07] so don't think you're gonna don't think
[1:10:09] you're gonna outsmart
[1:10:11] the only thing that's gonna outsmart
[1:10:12] this world is god
[1:10:15] the only pavilion like brother colley
[1:10:17] would talk about this morning on in
[1:10:18] psalms you get in his pavilion you don't
[1:10:21] have to worry about it
[1:10:22] you stay out here man's pavilion
[1:10:25] oh listen they know where we at
[1:10:28] so you're gonna be able to hide you can
[1:10:30] prep all you want to
[1:10:32] may i speak a second
[1:10:34] you can prep all you want to it ain't
[1:10:35] bad to put up food
[1:10:37] we got food we put up in the 60s we
[1:10:39] can't even find
[1:10:41] or shells gun shells but that's because
[1:10:44] we thought then
[1:10:46] it was going to happen that way we were
[1:10:47] going to be and we could be run down and
[1:10:50] and not be able to buy stuff but you
[1:10:51] listen
[1:10:53] three places in the bible
[1:10:55] they were getting ready to kill jesus
[1:10:57] before his time
[1:11:00] one they were going to run him off a
[1:11:01] cliff they had him at the back of a
[1:11:02] cliff and they were going to push him
[1:11:03] off the cliff
[1:11:04] the bible says he
[1:11:06] walked through the crowd
[1:11:11] second one they were going to stone him
[1:11:14] he walked through the crowd and i think
[1:11:16] the third one they were going to stone
[1:11:17] him again they hated the son of man do
[1:11:19] you think they're going to like you
[1:11:22] even his own friends
[1:11:24] listen he stood up one day and he said i
[1:11:26] can't heal nobody in this town
[1:11:28] he had to take them outside the town
[1:11:32] jesus christ god himself
[1:11:35] because of their unbelief had to take
[1:11:37] them out of the situation they were in
[1:11:40] spiritualize that a little bit would you
[1:11:42] maybe god can't do anything to you
[1:11:44] he takes you out of the city you're
[1:11:45] living in
[1:11:47] i ain't talking about physical
[1:11:52] just saying
[1:11:56] but listen
[1:11:58] it came to pass when all the kings of
[1:12:00] the amorites which were on the side of
[1:12:01] jordan westward and all the kings of the
[1:12:02] canaanites but you know what happened
[1:12:04] what jesus did he just changed their
[1:12:06] eyesight
[1:12:07] see that was the son of man
[1:12:09] that was adoption
[1:12:12] what happened to elisha and gaheza same
[1:12:14] thing
[1:12:15] gaze's eyes were shut elisha said we got
[1:12:18] chariots all the way around us
[1:12:20] gaza said um i don't know if there's
[1:12:23] there's only two of us and there's ten
[1:12:25] thousand of them what did elisha say god
[1:12:27] he was looking
[1:12:30] he didn't say god
[1:12:31] open his blinded eyes he said god open
[1:12:34] his eyes so we can see these angels
[1:12:36] hanging around though every tree limb
[1:12:39] more for us than they are against us
[1:12:41] that's what we're looking for with
[1:12:42] adoption folks we will never take a body
[1:12:45] change without being adopted
[1:12:51] then we can walk through and change the
[1:12:53] eyesight of a crowd
[1:12:56] that's trying to kill you
[1:13:00] i'm just telling you folks the son of
[1:13:02] man
[1:13:03] read matthew mark luke and john
[1:13:06] that's the characteristics of the son of
[1:13:08] man
[1:13:09] that's if he's back in power now again
[1:13:11] that's the way we're going to have to
[1:13:12] act
[1:13:15] sorry
[1:13:16] what i'm trying to get you to see i'm
[1:13:17] trying to get you to get all the doubt
[1:13:19] out
[1:13:20] get all that away from what that i can't
[1:13:22] do this and i've got a night that i
[1:13:24] can't get no
[1:13:25] you can get rid of those eyes because
[1:13:27] watch
[1:13:29] when they just heard that the lord had
[1:13:31] dried up the jordan
[1:13:33] before the children of israel until we
[1:13:35] were passed over that their heart melted
[1:13:38] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[1:13:40] because of the children of israel
[1:13:42] wow
[1:13:44] look at verse two
[1:13:47] and at that time
[1:13:49] which was that this morning at that time
[1:13:51] the lord said unto joshua make these
[1:13:52] sharp knives and circumcise again the
[1:13:54] children of israel the second time
[1:14:05] i'm gonna let that sink in for a minute
[1:14:10] do you ever ask god to
[1:14:12] circumcise you again
[1:14:19] because remember it's the furtheman of
[1:14:20] the journey
[1:14:22] it was a requirement
[1:14:25] why do you think there's a holy ghost
[1:14:27] right up there
[1:14:28] holy spirit right there what
[1:14:31] it's circumcising all this right here
[1:14:35] because that dick didn't circumcise when
[1:14:37] you got the new birth
[1:14:39] that circumcised the old man that killed
[1:14:42] the old man and put god inside of you
[1:14:44] then you need a circumcision of the what
[1:14:48] to put them things in you
[1:14:51] cut out some more of me lord kill more
[1:14:53] of me
[1:14:55] kill more of me
[1:14:57] we made sharp stones and circumcised the
[1:15:00] children of israel the second time and
[1:15:01] joshua made sharp knives and circumcised
[1:15:03] the children of israel to heal the
[1:15:04] foreskin and this is cause
[1:15:07] why joshua did this all the people that
[1:15:09] came out of egypt they were males even
[1:15:11] all the men of war died in the
[1:15:12] wilderness by the way
[1:15:14] they were in the way
[1:15:16] after they came out of egypt
[1:15:18] now all the people that came out were
[1:15:20] circumcised but all the people that were
[1:15:21] born in the wilderness by the way as
[1:15:23] they came forth out of egypt then they
[1:15:25] had not circumcised what they had not
[1:15:26] heard the full word of god
[1:15:29] they were only 20 years old they didn't
[1:15:31] they had only heard
[1:15:33] of what happened in egypt
[1:15:37] you can hear it on a tape all you want
[1:15:39] to folk
[1:15:41] but you got to live it
[1:15:43] it's great to have all those sermons but
[1:15:45] if we don't live it they're worthless
[1:15:49] but they're not worthless because god
[1:15:50] will not return void
[1:15:52] everything he says is going to be
[1:15:54] accomplished somebody's going to take
[1:15:55] this message and move it forward
[1:15:58] move it forward we're going to move it
[1:16:00] forward
[1:16:01] amen we're going to run this race
[1:16:04] to the people that were men of war which
[1:16:06] came out of egypt were consumed what
[1:16:07] they all had to die
[1:16:09] because they obeyed not the voice of the
[1:16:12] lord
[1:16:15] unto whom the lord swear that he would
[1:16:16] not show them the land
[1:16:19] which the lord swear unto their fathers
[1:16:20] that he wouldn't cease for he would give
[1:16:22] them
[1:16:23] but he didn't give it to them because
[1:16:24] they were disobedient
[1:16:27] what we read full obedience to the word
[1:16:29] of god
[1:16:30] entitles you to the token
[1:16:33] which the lord swearing to their fathers
[1:16:34] that he would give us a land that
[1:16:36] floweth with milk and honey and their
[1:16:38] children whom he raised up in their
[1:16:40] stead
[1:16:42] children so they were getting ready to
[1:16:43] cross
[1:16:46] them joshua circumcised for they were
[1:16:48] uncircumcised because they had not
[1:16:49] circumcised them
[1:16:51] by the way
[1:16:52] and it came to pass
[1:16:54] when they had done circumcising all the
[1:16:55] people listen that whole time they lived
[1:16:57] 20 years old they supposed to been
[1:16:58] circumcised when they were eight days
[1:17:00] old
[1:17:02] that was a requirement
[1:17:04] moses got in trouble because he didn't
[1:17:07] come on folks moses got in trouble
[1:17:10] sephora had to circumcise one of his
[1:17:12] kids that he forgot to circumcise
[1:17:14] and she got mad at him throw the
[1:17:16] foreskin at him and say they are the
[1:17:17] bloody husband
[1:17:19] because god would have killed moses
[1:17:20] because of the
[1:17:23] what i just told you in numbers
[1:17:25] but they've been 20 years
[1:17:28] they've been in the message for 20 years
[1:17:29] and they just hadn't heard the right
[1:17:30] message yeah
[1:17:35] they didn't have any good teaching
[1:17:37] to tell them where they were and what
[1:17:38] they was going to do but they had joshua
[1:17:40] came on the scene and when he did he
[1:17:42] said we're going to have to circumcise
[1:17:44] before we go any further
[1:17:47] that's why it cuts it cuts for people to
[1:17:49] preach like bob did wednesday night it
[1:17:51] cuts
[1:17:53] but that's okay
[1:17:56] it's cutting off the what excess skin
[1:17:59] the excess thoughts and ideas that we
[1:18:01] have and came to pass when they had done
[1:18:03] circumcising all the people that they
[1:18:05] have bowed in their place in the camp
[1:18:07] until they were whole
[1:18:09] in other words like i said they walked
[1:18:10] different and the lord said unto joshua
[1:18:12] this day have i rolled away look
[1:18:14] of the reproach of egypt
[1:18:17] i didn't get to that this morning
[1:18:20] today
[1:18:23] they were already crossed over jordan
[1:18:25] they still had some egypt inside of them
[1:18:32] that's in big print you'll be able to
[1:18:33] read that
[1:18:35] for all you older people
[1:18:37] and it's really it's really nice i like
[1:18:39] that
[1:18:41] but today
[1:18:43] you still had some of egypt inside of
[1:18:45] you when you crossed over the jordan
[1:18:52] trash
[1:18:54] sister shepherd's dream
[1:18:56] trash was being poured out of that
[1:18:58] pyramid where was it coming from it was
[1:19:01] her trash
[1:19:03] it was the trash it was inside today
[1:19:06] though
[1:19:07] i've circumcised you did what i said to
[1:19:09] do in the land you're supposed to be in
[1:19:12] the position that we're fixing to take
[1:19:15] there's no way we can get away from it
[1:19:19] we got to go this way
[1:19:20] this day have i rolled away the reproach
[1:19:22] of egypt from all few wherefore the name
[1:19:25] of this place is called gilgal until
[1:19:27] this day and the children of israel
[1:19:29] camped in gilgal and kept the passover
[1:19:31] in the 14th day of the month even in
[1:19:32] plains jericho
[1:19:34] and they did eat of the old corn of the
[1:19:36] land
[1:19:37] on the moral after the passover
[1:19:39] unleavened cakes and parts corn and the
[1:19:41] self-same day everybody understand what
[1:19:43] happened they were eating manna
[1:19:46] and now they ceased eating manna and
[1:19:48] they started eating the old corn of the
[1:19:50] land in other words they started eating
[1:19:52] something
[1:19:54] from the land
[1:19:57] they started listening to some good
[1:19:59] sermons
[1:20:03] they got some good food now manna was
[1:20:05] okay but you know what they load that
[1:20:06] stuff we hate this stuff they say we eat
[1:20:09] it every day three days three times a
[1:20:11] day
[1:20:13] pops wouldn't be bad three times a day
[1:20:15] though with it brother john
[1:20:17] popeye's chicken
[1:20:18] anyway
[1:20:19] but you see what but now look at that
[1:20:21] we're typing all this they eat the old
[1:20:23] corn of the land what it was already
[1:20:25] growing in the promised land god's not
[1:20:27] going to put something in there he's
[1:20:28] already got it there
[1:20:31] he actually let the world plant that
[1:20:33] stuff
[1:20:37] god's going to use everything
[1:20:40] to his advantage
[1:20:42] so he had the heathens
[1:20:44] plant corn knowing that they weren't
[1:20:46] going to eat it
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:50] there's technology now that there wasn't
[1:20:52] before
[1:20:54] so that we can eat better
[1:20:56] but it was probably invented by healing
[1:21:00] the devil said i'm gonna get them people
[1:21:03] i'm gonna give them wireless
[1:21:05] i'm gonna i'm gonna unhook them where
[1:21:07] they can go anywhere
[1:21:09] and they can get all my songs
[1:21:11] and all my evil stuff
[1:21:14] all this pornography i i i can just i
[1:21:16] can get into
[1:21:18] and and god's going
[1:21:20] that's old technology
[1:21:22] god said i've been using wireless since
[1:21:24] the foundation of the world
[1:21:26] i didn't need anything to talk to my
[1:21:27] people i just spoke to them
[1:21:30] didn't have to be connected with no wire
[1:21:33] and so god said okay i'm going to let
[1:21:34] y'all go and plant all that because i
[1:21:36] know you're not going to eat it
[1:21:38] but my bride is going to be able to put
[1:21:40] 1100 sermons
[1:21:42] in a little old thing it ain't much
[1:21:44] bigger than you watch
[1:21:46] where we used to have that whole wall
[1:21:48] honestly folks that whole wall right
[1:21:50] there
[1:21:51] that the door wasn't there well that
[1:21:52] whole wall right there had a shelf like
[1:21:55] store shelves
[1:21:56] from top to bottom am i telling a lie
[1:21:59] from top to bottom eight inch reels as
[1:22:02] many as you can pack in there
[1:22:04] and if you needed to check out four
[1:22:06] sermons you had four
[1:22:10] things about this big four of them about
[1:22:11] that thick four of them this high four
[1:22:16] now you can put 400 in your pocket
[1:22:21] don't tell me god didn't use some of
[1:22:24] those eyes
[1:22:28] but they eat the whole corner of the
[1:22:29] land they god knew we would want to
[1:22:31] listen
[1:22:32] and not have to be connected
[1:22:35] man everywhere we went can you imagine
[1:22:37] even though the reels being this big
[1:22:41] the thing to play it on was as big as a
[1:22:43] refrigerator almost
[1:22:48] right i mean it was it big as a suitcase
[1:22:50] the biggest suitcase so you got this big
[1:22:52] thing sitting in the middle of the floor
[1:22:54] you're getting a lesson here
[1:22:58] you ought to see one of these things
[1:23:00] but it's this big
[1:23:02] and it's got two eight-inch reels on it
[1:23:04] and you play it one to the other and and
[1:23:06] you're you're listening to the whole
[1:23:08] tape
[1:23:09] and then all of a sudden it goes
[1:23:12] it breaks
[1:23:14] so you have to put it back together or
[1:23:16] run the tape back around and then all of
[1:23:18] a sudden the belt inside of it gets bad
[1:23:21] so it starts going
[1:23:25] [Music]
[1:23:28] so you have to do like daddy the other
[1:23:29] one of the brothers did they stuck a
[1:23:30] pencil in the
[1:23:32] stuck a pencil in the reel
[1:23:34] and played it just like this
[1:23:37] they did everything he could do back
[1:23:38] then
[1:23:39] they just got into the promised land
[1:23:42] now we get into the promised land now
[1:23:44] and we got
[1:23:45] well it's not just press play
[1:23:47] but
[1:23:48] we press play anytime we want to
[1:23:51] amen
[1:23:53] somebody don't have to tell me to press
[1:23:54] play
[1:23:55] i can press it anytime i want to but i
[1:23:58] got to have a five-fold ministry to get
[1:23:59] out of here hey man
[1:24:02] yeah i'll do the same thing
[1:24:05] and they did eat of the old corn of the
[1:24:07] land
[1:24:08] on the moral after the passover
[1:24:11] unleavened cakes and parts corn in the
[1:24:12] self same
[1:24:14] day
[1:24:15] so now
[1:24:16] the children of israel
[1:24:18] and type of the new birth is in the
[1:24:20] promised land they've crossed jordan
[1:24:22] they're starting to eat different food
[1:24:27] am i okay with that
[1:24:29] different food
[1:24:30] something you'd never heard before
[1:24:32] what do you know what about this like
[1:24:35] like uh where's richard
[1:24:36] he's in the back
[1:24:38] okay
[1:24:39] richard come to church here and i'm not
[1:24:40] going to tell you where he came from but
[1:24:42] richard my brother-in-law that man my
[1:24:43] sweet sister
[1:24:45] that plays
[1:24:47] whatever this thing he plays over here
[1:24:48] plays the bass
[1:24:52] he starts hearing about the statue of a
[1:24:53] perfect man
[1:24:55] now richard back there he'll tell you
[1:24:58] he said i didn't know anything about
[1:25:00] that statue of perfect man now he'd been
[1:25:02] going church since white and since he
[1:25:03] was a kid
[1:25:04] in this certain message church
[1:25:07] him and aaron bowl well aaron was there
[1:25:08] too
[1:25:10] and richard said
[1:25:13] i didn't know they were required
[1:25:16] brother that was preaching on me i
[1:25:17] didn't know that was required
[1:25:20] but they'll say yeah they're required
[1:25:23] brother around a priest that's your
[1:25:24] perfect man and said we needed these
[1:25:27] things and the bible tells you that if
[1:25:29] you don't have them it says i had
[1:25:32] and if you don't have them you're blind
[1:25:36] he said i didn't know it was a
[1:25:37] requirement you know what that was good
[1:25:39] teaching is what it took richard it made
[1:25:41] him in a position where he knew he had
[1:25:43] to have the virtues
[1:25:45] to get out of here
[1:25:48] thank god
[1:25:51] it's not bad being wrong
[1:25:55] it's bad to stay wrong
[1:25:58] because if you stay wrong that comes
[1:26:00] inequity and iniquity don't make it into
[1:26:02] the kingdom
[1:26:03] all right you can have your own idea all
[1:26:05] you want to
[1:26:07] there's only one
[1:26:09] truth
[1:26:13] okay okay
[1:26:15] let's get
[1:26:16] a part of this
[1:26:18] second stage if that's all right because
[1:26:19] we moved into the second stage for i
[1:26:21] reckon that the suffering of the present
[1:26:23] time are not worthy to be compared with
[1:26:25] the glory which shall be what
[1:26:27] revealed enough so
[1:26:29] what we're going to talk about next time
[1:26:31] is the placing but once the placing's
[1:26:34] there you got to have a manifestation
[1:26:37] you can't just say i'm in the land
[1:26:40] i got the old corn
[1:26:42] i got the
[1:26:44] um
[1:26:45] honey and whatever it was um milk
[1:26:48] i've never seen milk flow
[1:26:51] but it says flowing with milk and honey
[1:26:53] but in other words it was a great place
[1:26:55] to be
[1:26:56] right
[1:26:58] so we got to get
[1:27:00] there to know where we're going
[1:27:03] and then we're going to be able to find
[1:27:04] when we when we get there find out what
[1:27:06] we where there's where's it at right
[1:27:09] i know where honey is in a honey hive
[1:27:12] then a beehive
[1:27:14] but if you don't know where the beehive
[1:27:15] is
[1:27:17] it'll do you no good
[1:27:19] watch
[1:27:22] for the earnest expectation here we are
[1:27:24] of the creation or the creature
[1:27:26] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:27:29] sons of god now how is that going to be
[1:27:31] it's going to be in human flesh
[1:27:34] it's not going to be a spirit floating
[1:27:36] around it's not going to be and listen
[1:27:38] don't get me wrong
[1:27:39] it's not going to be a light comes in
[1:27:41] the room
[1:27:44] i read you all quote a couple of sundays
[1:27:45] ago where brother brown said that light
[1:27:47] was not the son of man
[1:27:52] that light had a form to heal it was
[1:27:54] jesus christ there's no doubt
[1:27:57] but he was there to heal the people and
[1:28:00] save them
[1:28:02] but positionally place somebody you got
[1:28:04] to have god in human flesh here
[1:28:06] you've got to have god speaking through
[1:28:08] human flesh to have to come to adoption
[1:28:12] this is my beloved son whom i'm pleased
[1:28:14] to dwell
[1:28:14] hear ye him
[1:28:17] everybody all right with that you got a
[1:28:19] little bit of silence there but that's
[1:28:20] okay
[1:28:21] think about it
[1:28:23] i don't think we've got i don't think
[1:28:24] we've grasped what we got
[1:28:27] and what we need and what we're going to
[1:28:29] and what we're heading for
[1:28:32] but somebody is going to get it
[1:28:36] for the creature was made subject to
[1:28:37] vanity
[1:28:38] not willingly in other words to fall
[1:28:41] but by reason of him who i subjected the
[1:28:43] same
[1:28:44] in hope genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity in
[1:28:46] other words god said i'm going to put
[1:28:47] this thing back together i'm not going
[1:28:49] to i'm not going to depend on adam
[1:28:51] anymore
[1:28:53] surely not going to depend on eve
[1:28:54] anymore but i'm going to depend on
[1:28:57] myself
[1:28:59] same way with abraham remember he got an
[1:29:01] unconditional covenant who made the
[1:29:03] covenant god
[1:29:04] he swore by who his
[1:29:08] self he's going to have a bride that's
[1:29:11] going to speak in the end time
[1:29:14] you just got to decide whether you want
[1:29:15] to be a part of it
[1:29:18] or do you want to stay down there and go
[1:29:19] back and eat manna
[1:29:25] because the creature itself
[1:29:27] also shall be delivered thank god
[1:29:31] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:29:33] corruption
[1:29:34] and to the glorious liberty of the
[1:29:36] children of god we're heading toward a
[1:29:37] body change folks
[1:29:39] that's heading toward a body change
[1:29:42] because where is the corruption if you
[1:29:43] have the new birth the corruption is not
[1:29:45] in your soul
[1:29:48] where's your corruption
[1:29:53] for we know
[1:29:55] do we
[1:29:58] that the whole creation growneth and
[1:29:59] travails in pain together
[1:30:02] until
[1:30:03] right now
[1:30:06] now
[1:30:07] now let's read a couple of these and
[1:30:09] then we'll close
[1:30:10] let's go to number five
[1:30:15] i keep looking over here they want me to
[1:30:16] look up here because the way the screen
[1:30:18] is in the back so i'm gonna look here
[1:30:19] now in the spiritual sense after we were
[1:30:22] born into christ we become children of
[1:30:24] god
[1:30:26] lord now watch but then see
[1:30:29] god knows
[1:30:32] best now in the spiritual sense after
[1:30:35] we're born into christ we become
[1:30:36] children of god period
[1:30:38] but
[1:30:40] there must be more
[1:30:41] but then see god knows best
[1:30:46] because watch now here's where i say
[1:30:47] reverently disagree with my letter
[1:30:49] letter ray and brethren you think i'm
[1:30:51] persecuting the church no my dear
[1:30:53] brother no now this boy after he got a
[1:30:56] certain age he had to be adopted into
[1:30:58] that same family he was born into
[1:31:01] any minister knows that's the placing of
[1:31:03] a son he had to be adopted into the
[1:31:06] family that he was born into could you
[1:31:08] imagine that but that's the old
[1:31:11] testament teaching paul's referring to
[1:31:12] it here in the book of
[1:31:14] ephesus he brings it to ephesians
[1:31:16] because what did brother ram say
[1:31:18] ephesians parallels what joshua
[1:31:20] joshua was the placing i believe
[1:31:22] ephesians where we've been reading it
[1:31:23] that's the placing of us too
[1:31:26] all right let's go to number six
[1:31:30] and now this epistle the letter to the
[1:31:32] ephesians was written to believers not
[1:31:34] to the outside world we talked about
[1:31:35] that
[1:31:36] this is to believers this is believers
[1:31:39] that's why i thought this afternoon
[1:31:40] watch this right here
[1:31:42] that hurts some feelings right there
[1:31:44] that's why i thought this afternoon
[1:31:46] first i'd test and see if there's a
[1:31:47] group of unbelievers and sinners
[1:31:50] then i wouldn't speak this here couldn't
[1:31:51] speak this here
[1:31:53] but now seeing that it is for believers
[1:31:55] and the believers are present i thought
[1:31:56] it'd be good if we let the believer see
[1:31:58] where he was
[1:32:01] now try hard christians to understand
[1:32:03] that this day listen try hard christians
[1:32:07] to understand that this day that the
[1:32:09] message has been placing the believer in
[1:32:12] positionally placed
[1:32:15] wow
[1:32:15] if every believer in here was in their
[1:32:18] place
[1:32:20] well i'm so thankful that where the
[1:32:22] whole row of wheelchairs set there's
[1:32:24] only about two or three left in here
[1:32:26] if every believer knew their place as
[1:32:29] the lady on the cot and the man was
[1:32:30] crutches
[1:32:31] there would not be a feeble person in
[1:32:34] this building in the next 20 minutes
[1:32:37] that's right
[1:32:38] if every man could simply find his place
[1:32:42] his or her place so you sister same
[1:32:45] thing in christ what a difference it
[1:32:48] would make
[1:32:49] now i know filled your mind rolling fast
[1:32:51] he was discerning somebody was saying
[1:32:53] now brother branham i know where i'm at
[1:32:55] you think you do
[1:32:57] see that's it
[1:32:59] if you did it'd be
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:06] different if you did it would be
[1:33:09] different
[1:33:10] wow number seven
[1:33:14] now after this childhood becomes of age
[1:33:16] now he's still a child
[1:33:17] but if a child was reckless and never
[1:33:19] paid any attention and wasn't so
[1:33:20] interested in the father's work that
[1:33:22] child never became adopted into the
[1:33:24] family but if he was a correct child a
[1:33:26] good child and loved the work of his
[1:33:28] father and was interested
[1:33:32] you all want to try that sometimes
[1:33:34] interested and tried to do all he could
[1:33:36] do to progress his father's work look
[1:33:39] and try he wanted to he wanted to see
[1:33:42] his father's work progress
[1:33:45] he wanted to see his father's work
[1:33:47] successful is that not what you and i
[1:33:49] are doing here
[1:33:51] i want to see my father made manifest
[1:33:53] through me i want to see my father made
[1:33:56] manifest through you
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:33:58] what else are we here for
[1:34:00] well brother wait we're here to
[1:34:03] make a big powerful church with a lot of
[1:34:05] money and a lot of people and a lot
[1:34:09] god can do more with 15 cents than you
[1:34:11] can do with 15 million
[1:34:15] he can do more with 10 than we do with
[1:34:17] 90. we struggle with 90 and he don't
[1:34:18] struggle none with 10 of what we got
[1:34:22] so let's don't worry about that
[1:34:25] he loved the work of his father and was
[1:34:27] interested and tried to do all he could
[1:34:29] to progress his father's work then the
[1:34:32] tudor brought that word to the father
[1:34:34] and there was what's called the placing
[1:34:36] of the son or paul gives it in galatians
[1:34:38] the adoption that we was predestinated
[1:34:41] into the adoption of children by jesus
[1:34:43] christ the adoption now the same son
[1:34:46] that was born into a family could be
[1:34:47] adopted into the same family or placed
[1:34:50] in the same family or give a position in
[1:34:52] the family
[1:34:53] that he was born into
[1:34:56] and i do believe
[1:34:57] that that is the work of the holy spirit
[1:34:59] today among the church
[1:35:02] the joshua
[1:35:04] placing
[1:35:07] is trying to place the church
[1:35:08] positionally apostles teachers prophets
[1:35:10] and so forth as we've seen many false
[1:35:12] alarms and so forth moving amongst the
[1:35:14] people which only indicates that the
[1:35:16] real genuine adoption
[1:35:18] was at hand i believe it god has to
[1:35:20] place into the church that's the
[1:35:22] business of god not man
[1:35:26] all we got to do is what be submissive
[1:35:28] to it
[1:35:29] all right number eight let's read this
[1:35:30] one
[1:35:33] let's read the the red part
[1:35:36] now if that son proved to be a right
[1:35:38] kind of son loved the father's business
[1:35:40] stayed right with his instruction what
[1:35:41] is the father's instructions
[1:35:44] the bible the word the will
[1:35:49] the father then on a certain day took
[1:35:51] that son out before the public set him
[1:35:53] on a high place clothed him in a
[1:35:55] beautiful garment and he had what they
[1:35:56] call the adoption of a son or placing a
[1:35:58] son positionally what he was they had a
[1:36:00] ceremony then the father says this is my
[1:36:03] son
[1:36:04] i adopt him or place him look this is my
[1:36:06] son
[1:36:08] he's already born into the family but
[1:36:11] now i'm going to adopt him or place him
[1:36:13] where he needs to go in my family or in
[1:36:15] my body
[1:36:17] and if they had checks in those days
[1:36:18] that son's name on a check was just as
[1:36:20] good as his father's name was because he
[1:36:23] was placed and the son could fire who he
[1:36:25] wanted to he could hire who he wanted to
[1:36:27] he was in full possession of all
[1:36:30] that the father
[1:36:32] had let's go to number nine
[1:36:38] we'll stop right here
[1:36:40] placing of a son take him out in a
[1:36:42] certain place have a ceremony before
[1:36:43] angels
[1:36:45] that's why i really believe folks in
[1:36:46] 1963 that's why brother brown went out
[1:36:48] to tucson
[1:36:51] took him up on a mountain
[1:36:53] and adopted him
[1:36:55] put a robe around him give those seven
[1:36:57] angels look at that
[1:36:59] give him all kind of sign
[1:37:02] positionally placed him and said if
[1:37:03] you're gonna hear from god
[1:37:05] you're going to hear from that man right
[1:37:06] there
[1:37:08] i'm going to open the seals but i'm
[1:37:09] going to open them through the voice of
[1:37:10] that man right there
[1:37:12] and he positionally placed him
[1:37:15] that that was his job
[1:37:17] you say oh no brother brown's job was 46
[1:37:19] listen brother brown was born a prophet
[1:37:23] so what's what god said he's born a
[1:37:24] prophet but he come 47-63 he said that
[1:37:28] was what to get the people back
[1:37:30] the healing campaign was to get the
[1:37:32] attention he even says not in the
[1:37:33] healing campaign but when he begins to
[1:37:35] bring his message so in 1963 he brought
[1:37:38] the message he was supposed to bring
[1:37:40] that malachi 4 had already been pre
[1:37:42] produced but luke 17 30 revelations 10 7
[1:37:46] had to be produced in the opening of the
[1:37:48] seals the mighty book with the book open
[1:37:50] all right
[1:37:52] now watch this place him positionally
[1:37:53] what he is in the body of christ then
[1:37:55] that person has the authority
[1:37:59] but power without character satanic
[1:38:03] god's not going to give you the
[1:38:04] authority because look
[1:38:05] if he gives you authority he's not going
[1:38:06] to take it away from you
[1:38:09] not an indian giver
[1:38:10] so if he gives you the authority he's
[1:38:12] going to know that you've made it to the
[1:38:14] right place
[1:38:16] all right
[1:38:17] let me say this if you count me a
[1:38:19] fanatic from this night on that very
[1:38:20] same thing that i'm speaking of will
[1:38:23] be
[1:38:24] done
[1:38:26] there'll be a power put into the church
[1:38:28] and now is coming in that the holy
[1:38:30] spirit was so anoint to people
[1:38:32] so they'll speak the word and it'll
[1:38:34] create itself
[1:38:35] right there
[1:38:38] we haven't seen powers like that coming
[1:38:40] into the church now i know it for a fact
[1:38:43] say unto this mountain be moved don't
[1:38:44] doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:38:46] what you've said will come to pass you
[1:38:47] can have what you've said
[1:38:49] the placing of the church in position
[1:38:52] where the fullness of the power of the
[1:38:53] holy ghost comes into the church
[1:38:56] but wait a minute bro wait we already
[1:38:58] got the holy ghost yeah
[1:39:00] and you can sit there like a bump on a
[1:39:02] pickle
[1:39:05] i thought i'd use that i hadn't used it
[1:39:07] in a long time is that like a bump on a
[1:39:09] pickle
[1:39:10] that's a um claude why singer quote but
[1:39:14] you can you can sit there and just and
[1:39:16] die
[1:39:17] being a son
[1:39:19] you can just sit there and say well
[1:39:20] that's right i'm doing nothing else i'm
[1:39:23] not gonna raise my hands because letting
[1:39:24] it beside me ain't raising their hands
[1:39:26] this one over here ain't doing this
[1:39:28] you know what
[1:39:29] you'll be left right here
[1:39:31] the placing of the church in position
[1:39:33] where the fullness of the power of the
[1:39:34] holy ghost comes into the church then
[1:39:36] critic's mouth will be shut it'll be a
[1:39:38] short time jesus came right off the
[1:39:40] mountain went straight to calvary
[1:39:42] um
[1:39:43] notice it won't last long but it'll be
[1:39:45] here brother branham
[1:39:47] if he was adopted in 1963 i say for you
[1:39:49] not for me in 1963 well he was he had he
[1:39:52] died in 1965.
[1:39:55] in december he didn't last long after
[1:39:57] that why short quick powerful message
[1:40:00] same way with me and you it won't last
[1:40:02] long but it
[1:40:03] will
[1:40:04] be
[1:40:05] here
[1:40:07] you can get on the bus
[1:40:10] or you cannot
[1:40:13] you can decide whether you want to go on
[1:40:15] with god
[1:40:16] or not
[1:40:18] a couple of sundays from now we'll get
[1:40:19] in to really get into where the
[1:40:21] uh the ladies when they
[1:40:24] when they had these
[1:40:25] the 12 tribes are the 12 men
[1:40:27] that was the children of israel that
[1:40:30] started the nation of israel
[1:40:32] the prophet of god said whatever they
[1:40:34] screamed their name that they screamed
[1:40:36] at their birth
[1:40:38] that's what positionally placed them but
[1:40:40] now remember it took 400 and something
[1:40:42] years for that to happen
[1:40:45] remember they were born and then
[1:40:47] they were told you'll be in captivity
[1:40:49] for 400 years and god will bring you out
[1:40:51] with a mighty hand and then you're going
[1:40:52] to go 40 or more years in the wilderness
[1:40:54] then god's going to place you so it's
[1:40:56] not going to be an instant thing this is
[1:40:57] not listen this gospel is not a
[1:41:00] microwave gospel
[1:41:03] everybody know what i'm talking about
[1:41:05] this is a crock-pot gospel
[1:41:08] you turn it on and slowly it cooks
[1:41:12] how do you cook a frog
[1:41:15] how do you cook a live frog
[1:41:17] you're supposed to cook them live right
[1:41:19] you don't put them in boiling water
[1:41:22] who's going to eat a frog
[1:41:24] you put them
[1:41:25] you don't put me boiling water you put
[1:41:26] them in warm water
[1:41:28] let them get cozy in about every five
[1:41:30] minutes you keep turning it up about 20
[1:41:32] degrees at a time it'll cook that frog
[1:41:35] but he won't know anything about it
[1:41:37] satan's the same way we're going to cook
[1:41:38] satan
[1:41:40] he can do whatever he wants to do but
[1:41:42] look the church
[1:41:44] the power of god will be here
[1:41:47] i promise you
[1:41:50] that's our mandate that we bring it here
[1:41:54] it's here already it's just got to step
[1:41:56] into human flesh and start producing
[1:41:58] itself let's stand to our feet
[1:42:00] brother boyd's class and young adults
[1:42:02] practice after second service don't
[1:42:03] forget that
[1:42:08] uh you know
[1:42:09] sometimes the devil does get on you and
[1:42:11] he says well these people are getting
[1:42:12] bored listen if you if you're bored with
[1:42:14] just reading scripture you need a new
[1:42:15] birth
[1:42:19] i mean if you're bored with just reading
[1:42:20] scripture
[1:42:23] because i thought it was a live word
[1:42:25] i just want it to be made in in me and
[1:42:27] you
[1:42:30] i want to be able to see it
[1:42:32] brother dale wants to be able to see it
[1:42:34] brother bob all the different ministers
[1:42:35] wants brother louise there and want to
[1:42:37] be able to see it come alive
[1:42:41] what have we always told you at
[1:42:42] christmas time it don't matter you can
[1:42:43] get brother dale the taj mahal
[1:42:48] okay everybody who don't know that is
[1:42:49] google it
[1:42:51] it'll be on one of them channels or one
[1:42:53] of my places
[1:42:57] but the taj mahal is probably you can't
[1:42:59] buy it but anyway you could give him the
[1:43:00] taj mahal
[1:43:02] but he'd have he want one thing
[1:43:05] for you to produce what he's preached
[1:43:06] for 50 years
[1:43:09] and he's clapping
[1:43:11] that's what he wants he wants you to
[1:43:13] produce what he's been preaching
[1:43:15] because that's the only thing we do as
[1:43:16] ministers we want you to produce what
[1:43:18] we're preaching
[1:43:21] pretty
[1:43:23] but it's
[1:43:24] it's our mandate it's what we're going
[1:43:26] to have to do
[1:43:27] we've got to come to adoption we've got
[1:43:29] to come to where listen
[1:43:32] we'll talk about a little bit later on
[1:43:33] but even even these testimonies that
[1:43:35] people give
[1:43:36] to me that's positionally placed in this
[1:43:38] because what's it doing it's giving you
[1:43:39] more confidence
[1:43:42] in god and what he's doing in your life
[1:43:44] and even the little things that he's
[1:43:45] doing
[1:43:46] not so not the great big things the
[1:43:48] little things
[1:43:49] that he's doing in our life that's
[1:43:51] positionally placing us that's helping
[1:43:53] us to what grow
[1:43:54] to where if this next situation comes
[1:43:57] it's not going to be a tragedy anymore
[1:44:01] it's going to be a bump in the road
[1:44:04] then that then that bump in the road is
[1:44:06] going to be just a pebble
[1:44:08] then that pebble is going to be a grain
[1:44:10] of sand
[1:44:11] then then it ain't going to be where you
[1:44:12] don't even have to worry about that
[1:44:14] anymore to me that's growth
[1:44:16] not growth is just one time you come in
[1:44:18] here and then the power of god hits you
[1:44:20] and you prophesy and tell everybody what
[1:44:21] the problem is and and what's going on
[1:44:23] and all this stuff and
[1:44:25] that's okay
[1:44:27] but then brother brown said it was a
[1:44:29] life lived
[1:44:31] the life lived is the bottom line
[1:44:34] in how you handle god in your life or
[1:44:37] how god handles you in your life
[1:44:40] is the whole that's the whole thing you
[1:44:41] know what that is folks that's god in
[1:44:42] human flesh
[1:44:45] with the preeminence as brother brown
[1:44:47] was talking about it in christ in
[1:44:48] mystery gardenville with him having the
[1:44:50] preeminence in your life
[1:44:52] let's sing a song god bless you
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:45:04] [Applause]
[1:45:09] you have been true
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:29] i will see you in
[1:45:32] the rapture
[1:45:34] some sweet days
[1:45:37] sing it to him
[1:45:42] [Applause]
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:50] it's not going to be a day on the
[1:45:52] calendar we got to get ready
[1:45:55] [Music]
[1:45:57] [Applause]
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:09] forever
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:31] [Applause]
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:43] [Music]
[1:46:45] [Applause]
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:47:03] oh
[1:47:06] [Applause]
[1:47:09] i'll see you in the rapture
[1:47:14] i'll see you at
[1:47:17] that meeting
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:21] [Applause]
[1:47:21] [Music]
[1:47:26] [Applause]
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:34] i'll
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:42] you know when brother branham used that
[1:47:44] story about the armored meat packing boy
[1:47:46] that
[1:47:47] they saw the little girl not the three
[1:47:49] little denominational kids that he said
[1:47:51] they saw
[1:47:53] but that one girl the watch girl the one
[1:47:55] that was playing
[1:47:57] but you know when that
[1:48:00] armor meat packing boy
[1:48:02] he said i want to marry you
[1:48:05] and i'll come back in a year and i'm
[1:48:07] going to pick you up from this day i'm
[1:48:08] going to pick you up in one year

[1:48:19] well he said he's coming back
[1:48:22] he said he's coming to get me
[1:48:24] and he'll be back in a year so i'm just
[1:48:26] going to sit here and wait on him
[1:48:29] no if she did not
[1:48:32] the story goes she was standing on the
[1:48:34] porch
[1:48:37] fully clothed
[1:48:38] in her bridal gown
[1:48:40] because she believed not so much
[1:48:43] that he was just gonna might come she
[1:48:46] was expecting him to come
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:50] his wife
[1:48:51] made herself ready
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:53] his future wife was standing there with
[1:48:56] everything she didn't have dish water on
[1:48:58] her hands she done moved up a little bit
[1:49:01] in her position
[1:49:03] i don't believe she was back there doing
[1:49:05] that today that he was coming no she got
[1:49:07] cleaned up she put on the white garment
[1:49:10] she put everything on and she wasn't
[1:49:12] dirty
[1:49:13] she was ready to go though
[1:49:16] because he had told her a year ago

[1:49:23] wait
[1:49:25] just be ready

[1:49:37] using it because manifestation means to
[1:49:39] let it go or to tell
[1:49:40] or to what make known

[1:50:07] we know where he's talking we know where
[1:50:09] to meet him at we know what he requires
[1:50:14] and we know the promise that he's
