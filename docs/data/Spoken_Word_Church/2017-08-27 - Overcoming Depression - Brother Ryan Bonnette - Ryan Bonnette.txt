TRANSCRIPT
========================================
y'all wanna sit down for a minute please if you don't mind I thought to make it as quick as I can but it's come to our attention that there's a couple people gabbing I know that are struggling with depression and it's a spirit that she and I both dealt with when we were teenagers back before we met before we knew one another and so I want to testify to help those folks and let y'all know that we're standing here with you and fighting the battle but it's ultimately your demon to overcome if you're struggling with depression and it's not just for those that we know of it's also for these teenagers because I know that teenagers are very susceptible to that spirit and if you haven't faced it already you likely will some day lust and depression those things the devil tends to attack especially young people with someone tell you how overcame I testified at the Alabama camp of 2006 don't know if I ever testified here but at any rate I went through it during the age from 17 to 21 and especially in the latter part of that the last few months was very tough I thought about suicide often and it didn't even seem like suicide would do justice to it I was like job I curse the day that I was even conceived I wish I'd never been born that's how bad off I was but there's different reasons that people go through depression lots of different I call them triggers and for Gabby it was because she was an orphan girl from age 8 to age 16 she was sort of what you called downtrodden outcast every home that took her in as a foster kid they eventually kicked her out and she always just wanted a family that's what she begged called for she cried she she wasn't a Christian but she believed in God and she asked God for a family and ultimately age 15 she saw she probably gonna get adopted so she started trying to kill herself and she was very very uh upset very depressed well the Lord heard a prayer and gave her a family and they adopted her message believed in family so they introduced her to the message she came to know Christ she gave her heart to the Lord and believed the message and the Lord took away the depression and now she has family and Kentucky family here also Church family here in church family in Kentucky so God gave her the desire of a heart he's got family all around and no depression she's been free from depression for years and so of I so we're a testimony that you can live without depression you won't have it the rest of your life if you'll just fight it part of the reason that you succumb to that spirit is because you don't resist it okay if you embrace that spirit lust or depression or anything the devil tempts you with when you embrace it in other words you dwell on the thought it will you know you will succumb to that spirit so you resist the devil not once but constantly you never stop resisting the devil okay it's not just a one-time thing then it's over with it's an overcoming just like Christianity itself is not a one-time decision it's your whole life long every day you decided I'm gonna do right every single day I'm gonna resist the devil and I'll show you how I did that what depression is if you don't know it's an oppressive spirit this is a known definition from my experience an oppressive spirit that causes one to lose your drive or your motivation your desire you don't want to get up in the morning you don't want to go to bed at night you don't wanna go to work you don't wanna go to church you don't want to go to school you don't wanna do anything nothing makes sense there's just no purpose and you don't feel useful to anybody that was to me what depression was here's some of the lies the devil told me he said Ron you're not a Christian you must not be because you're struggling with depression I count brother branham as a Christian brother branham wanted to kill himself he tried a couple times and I believe I read in a message the other day where he had an oppressive spirit come on him every 7 years in his life I don't know if y'all remember that some nervousness or something whatever it was if you're struggling with depression it don't mean you're abnormal it don't mean that there's something wrong with you it doesn't mean you're not a Christian you just keep pressing the battle and don't stop never stop but they'll always tells us you know don't don't give up don't don't sit down don't stop don't what you call plateau you just keep going I mean whether you think you're born again or not you just keep pressing the battle okay and never stop that's been my theme for twenty years as a Christian is never stop and also Jesus was tempted to cast himself down the devil took him up to a pinnacle of a high place told him cast yourself down so order sounds like suicide but anyway God himself and flesh was being tempted you know when he faced things that we would face - and then the only difference between a Christian a depressed Christian and a depressed sinner is that the Christian has hope and as a sinner if a sinner struggled with depression I say get Jesus that be step one you know good case of salvation but the Christian has hope and your hope is the Word of God Jesus overcame by the Word of God and so do we every temptation he faced he found a scripture that was in opposition to that spirit and he withheld that was resisting the devil okay and I'll show you scriptures y'all go and put the Scriptures up there please you may not have a lot of word reveal to you but your hope it's the Word of God you'll find some promise in the Bible and hold on to that and you don't you can't do that if you don't read the Bible everyday read the Bible and pray every single day never forsake the assembly ourselves together be in fellowship read listen to sermons read sermons and you don't feel like doing that if you're depressed but I set and read through my crocodile tears having allows you y'see whew what was me time I said there were tears streaming on my face I read my Bible and pray and Satan saying why are you doing that I'd say well I don't know but I'm going to keep doing it anyway I'm not stopping I faced a lust demon I'm not gonna know the details of that but you know during the time I was facing a lust Eamon I turn around read my Bible and pray and you say we're on your hypocrite I'm not have been but I didn't stop you know you just don't ever stop here's a couple of Scripture this one I came across the other day this is not one that I used but I think it would be useful proverbs 10:28 the hope of the righteous shall be gladness that's your hope gladness not depression be glad next scripture please this is one of the ones that I use fun you can find many times at the Bible where it says rejoice this today was water made let's rejoice and be glad in it next one right rejoice evermore next okay Philippians 4:8 this is my what I count to be my new birth scripture but it's finally breathing you've heard the scripture what's everything true and you read through all those things says thank on these things okay next one this is what so the bowel tells us what to think about likewise it says what not to think about casting down imaginations every high thing that is all self against no one for God bring the captivity every thought to there be a surprised depression is not in obedience to Christ those thoughts you cast down you think on these things and then I'm trying to just be as quick as I can perseverance y'all remember brother Branham preached about perseverance listen that sermon read it look up the word tenacity I just recently look that word up it means to take a hold of something and grab it and hold it with all your might and never let go tenacity okay perseverance those two go hand in hand that's what a Christian has to be to overcome a Christian soldier okay you don't reason why you do or die every day you read the Word of God and pray don't care if you feel like it or not and then of course just good old-fashioned patience you wait on God because this took years I went through this spirit for years okay and kept reading my Bible and praying every day and crying and wanting to die all right scroll down I think there might be one more scripture I don't recall I guess that's it so my deliverance came after years of this struggling my deliverance Isis that came one day in 2006 I was praying and just really fed up sick and tired of being sick and tired I went as I often did just threw myself before the Lord threw myself on my floor in my bedroom and cried to God he finally spoke to me and he said you speak so I got up and I turned my prayer to the devil and I said Satan leave and that was when I was lifted from me and it's never been back since and then there was one of the voices that I heard there in that prayer and I can't explain this but it sounded like not one but multiple demons that I could hear within me crying and screaming as they were being cast down in fear it was very real and I've never been depressed since we're here with y'all we're praying with praying with y'all okay [Applause]
