========================================

my heart openly to my heart I want to see I want to see open the eyes of my heart openly as am i I want to say I want to see to see [Music] pour out your power [Music] shining in the pour out your power and we say [Music] holy Oh I wanted to see [Music] amen praise the Lord Jesus a man are you happy to be in the house of God this afternoon amen first and foremost I just want to apologize I'm not wearing a tie I completely slipped my my mind so I do apologize but I have a I have a blazer so uh you forgive me for that and [Laughter] but uh sometimes you know you just get so caught up with what you're gonna preach and then you just kind of forget some of the simple things they meant so so also uh Saints I just wanted to to mention to you all and if you all don't know real quick I wanted to to share with you I don't know if y'all are aware about the podcast that we've been doing lately it's called 10,000 worlds I'm currently about on episode 9 and what a podcast is if you don't know it's kind of like a radio program but it's real it's pre-recorded and it goes directly to your phone to your tablet or to your computer wherever wherever wherever you listen and what what the purpose of the podcast that we're trying to do is we're trying to interview you know Saints get in their testimonies or what God's doing in their lives trying to target our young people even trying to get young people involved to where they can share what God is doing in their lives and last episode that we had we had brother Ron and sister Gabby's testimony and so it was where it was wonderful to sit there in their living room with them and there's just them share about their battle with depression and their battle with suicide and just things like that that they went through and so we have we have a couple of things more lined up with it so if you don't know how to how to deal or work with the podcast I know not everybody knows how to tune in and listen to it you can get with me and I can share that with you so uh I think that'll be a blessing and you just pray for that because I wanna I want us to hear what God is doing in our day amongst people we got so many Christians and so many believers around the world that God is doing great things among and we have no idea what God is doing so that and I think that'll be an encouragement to each and every one of us you know it was great to hear what God did 40 50 years ago that's wonderful we still need those things but what is God doing now amen what is God doing in your life because he's still the same yesterday today and forever amen so while you pray for us as we as we doing this endeavor a minute praise the Lord Jesus let's just borrow our heads tonight our gracious Lord as we come before you right now father God we wanna just commit ourselves into your hands Lord and asking you dear Lord Jesus that you would just come on our on the scene this evening Lord God father god we've done what we could Lord is as a minister

just be with him during this time Lord God may you just bless them now bless our time now we made ourselves into your hands now in Jesus Christ name we pray amen praise the Lord Jesus amen if you want to turn with me and the brothers can pull it up in second Timothy chapter 3 second Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 through 17 hmm the Bible says all Scripture is given by inspiration of God do you believe that amen and it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen and then if we want to turn to 1st Corinthians chapter 10 first Corinthians chapter 10 verses 1 through 5 the Bible says here moreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and that all eat the same spiritual meat and it all drink the same spiritual drink notice they all part of this for they drank of the spiritual rock of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness amen if I want to give this a title tonight I just want to call it a neglected thirst a neglected thirst a man you may be seated this evening praise the Lord Saints brother brother Joe or whoever's in the back can can you cue up that that that uh that's I want you all to listen to this brought this prayer that brother Branham made in this message it was at the end of this message but the message and entitled Corinthians book of Corrections I just want you to pay attention and I want you to consider this and just listen here for just a moment I think you if you wanna if you wanna forward it forward it to timestamp 104 an hour [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] God looks down into my heart pumps are my seven look into my heart as the heart of the people here this morning and examine us Lord if there be something that takes the place of Christ Oh God take it away if it's laziness it's insufficient see if it's whatever it might be I don't know but God take it from us oh we don't want to be overthrown right here at this time of the battles over thrilled by God and be an enemy to him Oh God look into our hearts examine us for the Holy Spirit and let us see this morning if there's any evil thing in it if there is take it away father we now lay it on the altar to walk away and leave it there if it's idleness if it's temper if it's in difference if it's neglecting if it's whatever it may be if it's hatred if it's malice if it's sighs if it's whatever it may be Oh God take it from us and think and this coming revival may we be just so full of your charm Lord until many will come in and be saved the little community here where we tried so hard the first revival nineteen years that I've else now I pray that you'll give us that real real spirit in our heart and may it answer there for eternity granted Lord make us examine ourselves we married people by the way we treat our wives how true we are or how true our lives is to us and maybe we just get in our hearts this morning how we would think of something like that happen in our home and then may we turn our affections towards you say old God be merciful to me Oh if if the wife were just about every once a month just come by and put her hand on yours and say dear I love you and walk on oh how it would seem she was neglecting me how it would seem that something was wrong and God would maybe once a month or once when we go to church we offer a little prayer oh you are our love our communion all the time our thoughts and our intensive our heart will be stayed on being granted Lord Oh keep our heart so said only that the things of the world would become blind and sowing the difference granted Lord here is now I'm blessed in the further part of these services we asked in Christ's name Amen amen there's the Lord I thought that that prayer was such a sincere prayer now I believe that every true Christian Amen that would be the prayer of every true Christian amen the God amen to change our hearts amen and to look to look deep down and what it is Amen that is that is uh causing us and hindering our walk with God amen praise the Lord Jesus so I want us to in light of that Saints I just want us to to read first Timothy second Timothy chapter 3 again in verse 16 the Bible says here as we read but I'm gonna read it from the God's word translation and it says here every scripture passage is inspired by God all of them are useful for teaching pointing out errors correcting people and training them for a life that has God's approval I thoroughly believe Saints that the Word of God amen every passage of the Bible they met wasn't just put there just to be put there there's a purpose behind it amen and that's the reason Saints why we as ministers amen we need to consider about preaching the whole counsel of God amen now just take one little part because we feel comfortable with just this one part amen but you see Saints that we have needs in our in and our congregations we have needs and our within our families we have needs that need to be that need to be addressed and yet sometimes we we for neglect as ministers to find the mind of God to look and say Lord where is it that but people need what is it that the people want what is it that the people what current needs are they have and yet we give them something else and they're they're bleeding and they're there they're there they're hurting and we give something else amen praise the Lord we shouldn't be picky with the Word of God you shouldn't say well I'm gonna take this but not take this no we take the whole Word of God amen because it's the Word of God it's it's it's profitable every scripture passage is inspired by God all of them are useful for teaching pointing out errors correcting people well but we shouldn't correct people I beg your pardon the book the Word of God says different amen the Word of God says that we need to correct people they man because if we don't correct your if you don't correct your child Saints that would be they'll be they'll just those run rampant amen praise the Lord and training them for a life that has God's approval amen do you want your life to have God's approval I want God to look down at me and smile and say and say oh oh son you're doing good and say and say daughter you're doing you're doing good you're trying to do everything you can out of what with what you've got amen to live for me amen I want I want I want that so it's absolutely vital Saints that we a man as ministers amen we we we we we reach out and man and we speak to the families man we we reach out to the children we reach out to the older ones we reach out to the to each and every one because we are all in different levels and we all have different needs in our heart I mean my daughter Bella she's an she's almost 13 years old she has certain needs that I don't have amen she's at an age amen that's critical and if I'm not there to minister to those needs I'm doing her a disservice as a parent you see at that moment a man that's wonderful and I'm the this is no this is no slam against the minister here but at that moment what will Daniel seventy weeks do me when they're hurting no no no I'm not gonna disrespect brother brother wait but at that moment what will what will that do good to me when they're hurting when something's going wrong amen you need they meant to go in and look deeper into the into the into the root cause of things and I'm afraid Saints that a lot of times they meant we fail to do that and we wonder why our church goes a certain direction we wonder why our families go certain direction why why why the why the church amen in the hole is not prospering in the in the in the in in in the Word of God because we neglect amen I'm neglecting that's why I titled this a neglected thirst I neglect to me to to to to address those needs amen that my family may have sure I may be a provider sure I provide food for them sure I put food on the table but that's not enough you as a parent amen if you don't spend time with your children if you don't if you don't if you don't look and see that that that they need they need you they don't need your money they don't need your they don't need your the food they need those things but what they really crave and want is you I'm speaking of the parents now and most of us here probably have had children they want is you I heard his story one time with somebody that was in a in a in a grocery store and he had his little three-year-old boy son with him and and he was walking in the grocery store with him and he said and in the man a man stopped him and he said son sir is that your son and he said yes yes sir he said he said he told him he said you know what love that boy you know what love you know I love that boy he said you know how you spell love TI m ii think about that time and if you we don't spend time with our children if we neglect amen to look at the things that really matter amen because we're so busy caught up with everything else even if it's for the good god has given us people directly under our roof amen that we need to to to to spend time with into and to nurture and to care for amen you'll be responsible and you're the one who's to answer for that amen later on here we're gonna read a story amen that's that that of somebody that that that exact same thing happened to in the bible they match so in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 Paul Paul's here he's speaking to Gentiles amen and he says moreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how they all our fathers say men were under the cloud he meant all the Israelites back then they they went under the cloud they came out of Egypt and I'm just going to try to move as quick as possible they came out of Egypt they were baptized they've crossed over the Red Sea they did all these things under Moses they all per talk of it and yet only two were made it to the promised land out of all those people only two of them made it to the promised land yet they had the message of the hour you see that was the message of the hour they were all baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so you know they were all they all had these things amen only two were able to make it a man so you could you could be here and you can have all the mysteries and you can have all the doctrine and you can you can you can have everything down to the tee but if you don't have love Paul said you're nothing you could you can you can have every date and you can have everything amen down to the tee but if you don't have love in your heart for one another you're nothing Paul said you're only a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal and you can't you if you can't really truly from your heart say I love you brother forgive me brother forgive me sister forgive me and you know that you need to something's wrong with you I don't think the love of God is dwelling there and you know what the love of God is when you're born again filled with the Holy Spirit the baptism the Holy Ghost has come upon your soul your that that means that you have full eternal life in your soul that means that you should have all of God in you including love and God is love the Bible says God is truth God is peace I am the way the truth and the life you should have all these things and if that love is not being expressed as we'll read here in just a moment that agape love that love of God and something's wrong you need to reconsider am I really born again do I really I'm not trying to bring doubt saint's I'm just trying to I'm trying to to encourage you because some of us were just walking walking in this life maybe thinking that we have something when in reality we may not just because you go to this church doesn't mean that you're born again just because you can explain Daniel 70 weeks in the seals and all the mysteries down to the T doesn't mean that you're born again you can have it all up here and not have God and you miss God by 10,000 miles when you don't know how to act among among around one another and disrespect one another you you you you make fun of people even from the pulpit calling people names when they disagree with you that's wrong that's not the love of God and they'd all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them see with many of them God was not well pleased and they were all going through these motions they were all doing everything that Moses told him to do and they were they were obeying the message and God was not well pleased with all of them now verse six of that of that same of 1st Corinthians chapter 10 says now these things were our examples to the intent for the purpose that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted that's why these things were written in the word amen not just for historical facts and figures amen but there it they were written for us for our example so that we can look and say wow I don't want to do that I don't want to be like that I don't want to make that decision and then and then have to pay for it later thanks God cares about you God cares about your soul whether you're old whether you're young whether you're middle-aged it doesn't matter God is concerned about your life God is concerned where you are right now don't think that God is not he is he loves you and he has a specific word to minister to your specific need at this very moment no matter what age you are praise the Lord if we skip down to verse 11 Paul says here now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition you see the purpose why those things were written for our admonition for us to look and say wow I don't want to do that I don't want to be like that Amen on upon whom the ends of the world come wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall sometimes we think with it we just we feel such a security on us because we come to this church and we throw our Lulla security blanket on us because brother Dale he preaches the word and brother Wade preaches the word and the minister here preaches at work comfortable I know Daniel 70 weeks I got it down to the tea and I get and you don't know how to love your brother that's security blanket no it's not doing you any good you don't know how to treat each other you don't know how you disrespect each other you you you amen I I'll be the one to say I've done that I've been there done that but I want to change I want to change I want i want saints and if the change is going to happen with me so that the rest of the church can change amen then so be it i want that i want to get out of here amen because we fail sometimes to to to to address things at the root level amen and we find ourselves in positions that we shouldn't be a corinthians book of correction brother Branham says here every one of them went into the wilderness jesus said not all that Seth Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven it isn't what you say you could preach the gospel and still be lost certainly this is not just little kids stuff brother Branham says this is absolutely it's deep we we need we need the the major doctrines of the Bible we need those things I'm not discrediting now I'm not I'm not that's not what I'm trying to do we need those things we appreciate the things that we that we hear in our church but but the brown said I hear these things live in a good Christian life living a Christian life and knowing how to treat one another that's deep and it's much smoked some some of us we don't know how to do that and yet we've been in the message for 40 years you don't you don't know how to treat each other I don't know maybe I'm overstepping my boundaries I hope not I'm just trying to encourage you Saints and Christianity is not just to be just a little light fabulous thing like well I'll go over to church and I know it's just it's my duty to go that's not Christianity just because you're here and you're warming up you that's not Christianity that's not it's something that God has done see you can't do it God has to do it God has chosen you in Christ and presented you as a love gift to Christ and if God's calling election and if we have the opportunity to become that type of person and turn it down for little old things of the world Brandon continues in that same message but brother it's a lot more than intellectuals we need good teaching again don't get me wrong we need teaching we need we need the fivefold ministry but just because you can explain the things of the Bible doesn't mean you're born again you could just have a security blanket on you it goes to a genuine birth not just a mental conception or an emotional work but but a birth and experience something that goes plumb down deep into the heart and change in the inter inner most seeing that prayer that brother Branham was talking about constantly mentioned in the heart the heart Lord changed my heart amen because Saints we can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul but we still that's the reason why we need the the statue of a perfect man because we still wrestle with our spirit amen we still wrestle with with with with a the five senses the five senses of the of the spirit realm come to me again by the way memory reason conscious affection and imagination the the new birth in your soul doesn't change those those things that's the reason why we need a man the statute statue of a perfect man amen serene so it's a constant battle day by day in the Notre for and if and if we are working in the spirit man then it's gonna manifest in the in the flesh man amen Jesus said whatever is in your heart that's what you're going to portray a man out of the abundance of the heart speaks the mouth don't tell me that you're Christian amen don't tell me that you're a Christian and you're talking dirty all the time yeah that just tells me one thing that's what you feed on don't tell me that you're a Christian and you're constantly looking at people hating hateful resentful bitter that's what you feed on a man that makes you do things that you would not have done other words otherwise it makes you love those who are unlovable makes you act different than you ever thought that you would act and when situations arise it's your anchor Amen no matter what it is in the home in the church no matter what situation it is if it arises Amen if you have that Amen in your and your innermost in your soul Amen that expresses through the spirit man and out through the flesh man and man that's your anchor that's this love amen that's the reason why if you have love in your soul which is God is love right the scripture says that then it should be reflecting amen showing forth through your spirit man and out your it's your flesh man but if it's not then what are we supposed to conclude think about that Saints you could just be in a justification or sanctification a state and you can explain all these mysteries and yet died this tonight without the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul if we go back and read 1st Corinthians chapter or this is this is a new scripture 1st Corinthians chapter 13 let's read from verses 1 through 3 I want to read from the good news translation because it has more impact they men and all of you are know this scripture I may be able to speak the languages of human beings and even of angels but if I have no love my speech is no more than a noisy gong or a clanging Bell I may have the gift of inspired preaching I may have all knowledge all knowledge and understand all secrets whether in life or in the word I may have all the faith needed to move mountains but if I have no love Paul says I am nothing that's pretty strong because see sometimes we base our life and we base we base our experience that that we on the externals that because we do this or we know this or or we come to lula we we've got it that doesn't mean that a man I'm a give away everything I have and even give up my body to be burned but if I have no love this does me no good and when you go back and look at what that word love there that's the word agape that's not a filial love that Paul was talking about that's the love of God so if you have no love the love of God in you and you can explain Daniel so many weeks everything every every everything and you can explain the seven seals and you can just you can explain everything down to the T and there's no love in your heart either means one of two one of three things you're either in a justified state or in a sanctified state or you don't have anything at all you're an unbeliever or you just have it up here but it hasn't come down here that you can mean that's the only three things that that can mean think on this thing Saints where are you brother Brandon preach the message called amen thinking on your ways you know something on that line as I thought on my way think on your think on your life am I here at church just because just because it's a tradition because I'm supposed to come by man well what is the purpose of me living a Christian life well am i impacting other people spiritually what what are you doing that's impacting people spiritually and sometimes we get criticized amen for doing something for God and doing something - for God and I'll ask you what are you doing what are you doing for God that's impacting your children that's impacting your your husband your wife your your pastor your your church amen you the people are here what do they see or do they see just formality and in tradition that's no different in a Catholic Church we may not have statues here but we sure make we can make this a Catholic Church a denomination word can't be denominated this message can't be demand mated but in your heart and your mind it can be by the way you look at it first Corinthians chapter 13 verse 4 3:11 continues here love is patient and then the good news translation love is patient it is not jealous or conceited or proud ah love is not ill-mannered or selfish or irritable love does not keep a record of wrongs love is not happy with evil but is happy with the truth I want the truth amen give me I want the truth let me do whatever I can to get to the truth amen love never gives up and it's faith hope and patience never fail love is eternal because this is the love of God right there are inspired messages but they are temporary there are gifts of speaking in strange tongues but they will cease there is knowledge but it will pass and skip down to verse 11 when I was a child my speech feelings and thinking were all those of a child now that I am an adult I have no more use for childish ways some of us here adults and still act like children spiritually I put myself in there as well we should be we should be eating the heavy things of God and letting those heavy things of God to strong meat amen changing us from the inside out but sometimes some of us are even still questioning to this day whether you have the Holy Ghost or not and you've been coming to this church for 40 years and you've been you you listen to the message for 40 50 years and you still don't know if you've got the Holy Ghost I'm challenging you Saints it's a late hour for us to just be playing church amen this is maybe not not what you came to hear amen ah but it's the Word of God am I not preaching the Word of God is the word you get mad at the word don't get mad at me Amen praise the Lord so I'm just gonna skip down some of these things amen I mean so if your own soul hasn't been sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I meant in order to display this love what does it matter that you know all these mysteries what what does it matter amen we you know and we say phrases like people in this message the people in this message they they're you know what you're doing when you do that you're throwing seeds of dissension in people's minds because I believe people out there want the same heaven that you and I do they may not be in the same place where you are they may not be in the same spot or or have the same revelation that you are are but they're striving I would rather be at a place where it's full of love then than to have no love whatsoever and yet know all these mysteries down to a team why do we do that that that's not the love that Paul was talking about we're doing the congregation of the service amen thanks it's it's it's it's it's like brother branham's talked about when he talked about that eagle the eagles nest amen and he made it and he made it and the eagle made it all comfortable and and in in in all all of the eaglets there were all comfortable but it came a time Saints they came a time that they needed to go fly they needed to go fly on their own you need their car has to come a point in time that you need to know these things for your own amen there's not enough that the ministry knows that amen you do how are these things you know them and how are they impacting you are they changing you from the inside out and are they causing change in other people affecting other people I mean because I'm saying we need we need to say these things we need to say these things sometimes because sometimes we like our comfort zones I didn't come here to make you comfortable tonight I didn't come here I'm not gonna be silent to make you comfortable get on that security blanket again cozy no something-something the mother ego at one point in time lips that that skin off the nest and say it's not for you bow to all to fly that's what I'm saying to you tonight Saints it's time for us to fly amen it's time for us to get out of here praise God little things a man come off amen and we're all childish about it it's time for us to fly because Saints you know when it came time to rebuke bad behavior Paul rebuked bad behavior and he gave a reason for it when it came time to deal with the husband and it came time to deal with the wife Paul dealt with those things Paul dealt with children no with the children part dealt with the home life Paul dealt with with the with ministry Paul dealt with all these items a man in the Bible and so did brother branham praise God amen and if if we ministers amen if if we choose Amen to be silent about these things and our silent our silences is the bullet that that's gonna kill the congregation No praise God and sometimes we're afraid Amen to to to look at these things because we don't like conflict we don't like we don't like a conflict we like things so easy and we like we like things just a microwave fix and move on then don't tell me that's not how things are and you know what that's gonna cause you problems in the long run you know what that's called that's called sweeping things under the rug problems keep coming up same problem sweeping it under the rug before you know it that thing is gonna be piled up over here and everything that you had on there there is what's causing in your houses is gonna cave in you're tripping over the rug because you fail to - they'll deal with things at the root level do you want to hear about a story about somebody in the Bible that then deal with things in the root level and what it caused them it's in the Bible and there's quite a few examples in the Bible but this is the this one right here is the one that catches my attention more and I want all parents to listen listen to this because this was a father a father who neglected amen his his family his his who was a king we're talking about David here he had all he had six sons the first six sons that he had one of them being Absalon he was the third one the first one was aim aim and Mammon or something like that can't remember I'll go back in here in just a moment so you you read that he had these sons in First Samuel Chapter First Samuel Chapter three and he had these six sons and then there's no mention again of these sons until Samuel chapter 13 and all this time David was busy being your king he was busy building the city fighting wars busy with with with the responsibilities of being a king and forgetting that he had wives and concubines and children at his house that needed him they he was he was busy and sometimes Saint says his parents we're just too busy that's why I said earlier today Oh Waldo we're just too busy to do the things amen spend time with our children to spend time with our wives to spend time with our husbands amen to do those little thing you say myself it doesn't matter you know they'll be fun oh I beg your pardon it matters a lot whole lot some of you probably have experienced that it and you see the effects of not doing that and you know if you want if you want a book of if you want to read soap operas or drama just read the books of first samuel second samuel first king second kings that right there is the most soap operas that you can have you don't need days of our lives you don't need nothing i don't know what soap operas are out there now but you don't need know that you think you just read those lives if you want you want to see stories of raping and and and and in murder and deceit and all these things you just we go back and read those books it's there but remember what paul said they're there for our example they're not just so to inform ourselves they men they're there for us to look and say wow i i don't want that in my life i want that in my life amen so david's time was was spread so thin amen because of of his multiple wives and concubines and children amen but david even though he was a wonderful king did what he was supposed to do and love god we know he's and we know that we love we see that he loved god yeah he was an absent father through all of his sons but especially to Absalon and sometimes we we don't we felt in the we neglect amen how do we balance the life work in our lives you know but there's got to be a balance god gave you those children for you to just constantly be working all the time constantly be working out of town and neglecting those children amen that's that's a disservice to them they need you amen because children's needs as I said earlier they they go way beyond were you providing food at the table they they go way beyond that just because you provide for them food on table or give them some money from time to time or whatever that does not mean that they have your heart that you have yet that you have their heart I want my children's heart I want my daughter's heart amen first of all want their God to have their heart amen but I want them to be so comfortable with me I want them to to be able to come to me whenever they have issues come to my wife whenever they have the first people they come to is to come come to us they can they can be so comfortable coming to you because they know that you're not going to treat send them away they know that you're not going to just kick them out the door and just amen I want that for my children and I don't know of any parent that doesn't I don't know of any parent that doesn't and so and so Saints the little things that we neglect become bigger things we keep sweeping things under the rug because we think in our mind that it's not important you're gonna realize one day that you've made a mountain out of something that you could have stopped there's a nursery rhyme that that I found then you you've all may have may have heard it if the brothers can bring it up for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost for want of a horse the rider was lost for want of a writer the message was lost for want of a message the battle was lost for want of a battle the kingdom was lost and Oh for the want of a horseshoe now just let that sink in all because you've you failed to fix the little things that came up in your life oh it's not important it's okay time will heal things now time doesn't heal things and we keep that mentality up we're not gonna get anywhere people are hurting people people people need closure and yet we still keep that mentality in our hearts that's gonna be the downfall of your family is gonna be the downfall of this church it's gonna be the downfall of anybody that keeps that mentality in their heart but David's inconsistent life amen and Absalon he experienced his dad's neglect well everybody was praising him and everybody was saying oh how great David was he killed his his mighty man all these all these great things look at the great big cities that he that he built and all these wonderful things that he said about that the people were saying about David and yet they didn't know what was going on behind David's family life and Absalon saw this this whole time watching his dad my dad doesn't want to play ball with me okay next day comes dad can we sit down and pray son go ahead go ahead and pray on your own I'll do it with you tomorrow I'll read you that story tomorrow okay 10 years later dad can you come let's do this together let's go hunting together son I've got I've got I've got this war I got a fight I got this battle I've got a I've got a you know I can't do it today okay dad can we go do this that or the other I see that you're not doing anything you're just up on the roof what are you doing up on the roof looking at what not known at that moment David was sinning what are you doing and all this Absalon had in his heart in his mind and probably all his other children too I'm challenging parents life it can get in the way but there's something that we can stop it right now you don't have to go that you don't have you are responsible for your children unto a certain point at that point a man that then you just give him over to God but where are their Holy Ghost up to a certain point I like one thing that brother Joe told me one time he said I am NOT going to fail I'm not going to fail to do the things and do things that with my children that are that will benefit them amen and one day they go and tell me dad you didn't do nothing with me you didn't you need to do this amen that that stayed with me as we criticize amen because we were out too much doing things for the young people and in camps and things like that you know what Saints you do not know that a seed can be planted at that particular camp that will have give them the new birth at it but at some point in time the Word of God is being preached other people probably saying oh I'm so on you're so lucky you have your dad as the as the king and so lucky that your dad and Absalom is probably you know what yeah but you just don't know I my dad may be your king but he's not my dad remember what we're talking about the neglected thirst so I don't know Saints if you all have gone through experiences of maybe finding that your maybe your parents living double lives and things like that I'd you know I thank God I never had to go through something like that but you know what Absalon had to go through that they found out that his dad was was living a double life committing adultery with Bathsheba what do you think how do you think he felt what do you think went through his mind you see and and since there is nothing that's gonna persuade your children more than the life that you live before them if what comes out of your mouth is what you do that is going to persuade them more than any money that you can give them here you go through some money you go on ahead now it's okay here's some candy that's gonna that's gonna persuade them more then any anything here's some food here's some food son hey hey look you know there's gonna cause me more reaction from them to be want to be I want what mom and dad have then just Patchen kind of things up and here you go here here's a tablet here is the iPhone are you even thinking that you might be doing damage to your children by doing those things does they even go through your head that you might be doing that and then when your children are out in the world and and and come home with things you never thought they would come home with then you wonder wonder feel is my fault as we see it same children that grew up in church I'm not gonna say here and say guarantee that my children won't go and do things that they're not supposed to do I'll be the first one to say that but I sure am gonna do everything I can to cause it to right now to cause to make sure they don't go those ways and to sow something then in their heart they men they will make them think on their ways when they're getting ready to do something they're not supposed to do but sometimes what we do is just give them a phone or give them a tablet we go do our own thing I like it that it's quiet because you're listening to me and I hope that you're thinking on your ways amen when a child sees that they're serving and giving and forgiveness and reconciling and worshiping in the home and hospitality amen they're gonna pick up those things and they're gonna learn and grow up amen with those things but when a child sees fighting cheating lying no self-control hypocrisy jealousy that's what do you think your child is gonna learn it's the simple law of reaping what you sow don't get upset at your child because he's acting just like you so later on after when we see when we see that Absalon he was he was mentioned in in fir in 2nd samuel chapter 3 and then it's not he's not mentioned again until 2nd samuel chapter 13 and it was in that story where am ninh david's oldest son raped his half-sister as horrible as that looks and as horrible as it is it's written in the Bible it says it's in the Bible that's the reason why I started off with the scripture that all Scripture is given to us for examples for correction for us to look at and learn from so here is is and I'm not gonna go through all the details of that you can read it in second Samuel chapter 13 but at the end amen I want I want I want to read this the brothers can pull up second Samuel 13 verses 19 through 22 Tamar is David's a daughter and damar put ashes on her head after the the incident had happened after a man had raped her her own half-brother and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying and Absalon her brother said unto her have em ninh die brother been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing in other words let's keep peaceful about this just just for a little bit so tame are remain desolate in her brother absalon's house where she was a a wretched woman in absalon's house because her her virtue had been taken away by her own family member but when King David heard all these things he was very wroth in other words he was very angry in other versions of the Bible the Bible says that he was very angry but did not punish em then we don't see anywhere in the Bible where he punishes Amnon for what he did that's a terrible sin don't you think that's horrible but David being the king who had power to say and to decree and things as such does not do anything about it so guess what happens Absalon starts built in a complex and starts building the hate towards his father first of all to M Ninh his brother because of his of what he did to his his sister and then towards his dad because his dad didn't do anything about it I want us to look at our our family life Saints are we correcting our children are we telling them you're wrong you're wrong for doing that or we just kind of just sweeping it under the rug just because they're our own children we don't want the public to see and we don't want the church to know that our children did such-and-such do you know what you know what happens when you do that and you lie and you try to cover up things in your life and stuff like that you're losing you're damaging your own integrity you're damaging your own integrity if the ministry does that in a church we're damaging their integrity here if you as a family man as a husband as a wife if you do that covering up for your children and things like that and not acknowledging that you are wrong and you're and you're and you did it and you and and and and try to make things right then you're losing integrity goes a long way now nobody can trust you anymore David got to this point with his children and absalon's eyes because in those days in those days if you rape the woman and think you were supposed to provide for her you see or else you were gonna get killed so what was the reason why David didn't do what didn't didn't punish his own son whether in private or in public maybe maybe he was thinking about his his his is that M Ninh was his firstborn so he was next in line to be a king I needn't want to do anything to damage that dynasty that he was trying to build maybe the was the purpose I don't know but was it right was it right that his sister that that his own daughter was was violated by his own son and nothing was said about it oh I got it mad about it that's not doing anything about it that's not going in and and pulling out the scabs and going into that cancerous area and and cleaning that that infection that that that does nothing going down deep into the root of the matter why because I don't have time I don't have time to deal with it I don't want conflict I don't want to why are we so neglectful the men are as leaders of our home as parents absolutely we as leaders of the church we need to tell the truth whether it hurts you or not God knows if you didn't or not God one day will will will be the one - and your children are watching and listening whatever goes around comes around and some of us have probably already experienced those things I have sometimes sometimes my my daughter's maybe act in a certain way or did something or doing something on my window where did they get that from oh they saw me doing that just a few years ago I allowed that in my home I allowed that music in my home I allowed that thing in my home and you can't get mad at them now you have to go in and fix the thing at the root level and tell them why listen sweetheart listen baby I'm we don't allow this in our home this is the reason why I know that you saw me doing it I know that you saw this that or the other I'm sorry and I should not have done it we don't allow it in our home for this this this reason be willing to get down and humble yourself and say I'm sorry but as parents we don't want to do that we're too proud the moment that you start covering up and telling lies your integrity goes down the toilet amen so David didn't do anything in order to preserve his kingdom but that choice was what started the process of destroying what he wanted to preserve so we we keep going and uh if actually if the brothers could bring bring up how to raise a delinquent I found this online how to raise a delinquent now remember brother branham said that it's not child delinquency as parent delinquency he said that a lot of time began in infancy to give your child whatever he or she wants then they will believe they were - owes them a living step1 step2 when they pick up Boulder words laugh at them this will make them think they are cute step3 how to raise a delinquent never give your child spiritual training wait until they are 21 then let them decide for themselves step 4 we're getting there we'll have a full-fledged little delinquent here in just just any moment now avoid the use of the words wrong or sin these words may cause them to develop a guilt complex this will condition your child to believe later when he or she is arrested that society is against them and they are being persecuted step 5 we almost got him defend your child against neighbors teachers police officer or any authority and bail them out out of any problem they get into with the law they're all against your child you know and that's how you build how you raise a delinquent ask yourself is that what I'm doing so we see that david here he was an absent father he led an inconsistent life right he was a neglectful disciplinarian didn't discipline it when he needed to and finally he caused an incomplete reconciliation in other words he just brushed it under the rug and said and Absalon is is here a boiling cauldron of bitterness and he's not seen none of that in his son and so what happens is in in second samuel chapter 13 verse 22 dan Absalon spake unto his brother and then neither good nor bad in other words from that day forward he didn't want to speak to his brother anymore david should have caught on that now believe if David would have done something about what Ammon did they wouldn't have led Epsilon to come to this point for Absalon hated Emin because he had forced his sister Tamar so guess what happens Absalon takes matters into his own hands so he kills he has Amnon killed and then flees and we read in the Bible that David is crying for his son Adnan rightly so he's cry for his son Amnon but then he gets over a man and he's crying for his son Absalom because his son epsilon is gone from his presence for three years doesn't know anything about about him and all because of a choice that he made that David me amen but Absalom fled and went to tell my the son of mu king of Gesher and David mourn for his son every day so Absalom fled and went to get sure and went there three years and the soul of King David longed to go forth unto Absalon for he was comforted concerning Amnon seeing he was dead Dave David longed to see his son Absalom amen because you see saints David was the one responsible a meant to to start that reconciliation process he was the king he was the father he was the one who would to initiate that process but he didn't do anything about it and what and we as the parents say man we don't want to need if we are we're the ones that have been given Authority we're the ones that have been given more maturity than R then R than our children and then we're the ones who are responsible they meant to start that process of reconciliation if your son and daughter did something or if you or if somebody did something to you it meant you be the mature one to go start that reconciliation process oh no I'm gonna wait till they come to me that's not what this Bible says so jesus said himself if you've done oh if you have out against somebody a man go make that right but if you also know that there's up in that person's heart towards you you going to that person isn't that what the Bible says and why do we sit around waiting and our church is dying and things are happening and we're wondering what in the world is going on in our in our in our family's life in our social life and in the church everything and you could be the root cause I heard brother Branham tell a story of the other day he had a little boy come to him and on a prayer line he was he was being possessed and the boy was telling him was : brother the same brother branham you have it you have it william branham you have nothing against me it was the demons talking through him and brother Brown said come to find out what it was it was something that his dad had done that that was the reason why that boy was like that so sometimes it's not just your children's fault your children are looking at you and building complexes in their life and looking ends okay mom has this or dad has this oh okay well this is what I'm gonna do and then you blame them for their actions and you blame them for their misbehavior when you were the one guilty of it well that sounds hard but it's the truth you're the one that has to begin the process of fixing problems whether it's in the family or whether it's in church you're the one you're the leader you're the one to initiate has to initiate those things why why do people come to you you go to them so we can get that cancer out of the church so we can get that root that root out of the out of the family get that out of way so that we can move on and go with God and grow but you think we can grow when we have things still unresolved closure not being not being given about things that have happened we can't move on with God and that rug is just keeps getting higher and higher even if you think that you're going to be rejected go to the person anyhow make that right because you're you you it's a thing between you and God it's your relationship between you and God we're not going to heaven with bitterness in our heart I'll tell you that right now we're not going we're not going in glory with with things unresolved amongst us and things people are still holding things from years that have happened and nothing is said it's just we swept under the rug and time proves that that had time doesn't heal tom has not healed those things because they still keep coming up amen so we read later on then in in in second Samuel where David he's convinced that he should have absolute in Jerusalem Absalom comes back in Jerusalem three years that he's been he's been away from his father that bitterness still building and bubbling in him and that cancers thing and so he has Absalom back but we don't read anywhere in fret 2nd Samuel where where he has Absalom back and he and and David gets down talking business with him we don't the whole Absalon is back in Jerusalem great but David doesn't go and initially its son We Need to Talk son I'm so sorry son I did this What's Wrong son no none of that we don't read none of that in the Bible what happens is that when when thought when when when epsilon comes to David you know what happens all David does is give him a kiss in 2nd samuel 14 33 so drive came to the king and told him and when he had called for apps on he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed Absalom and that's all he and David's eyes he wanted a quick fix a kiss a pat in the back you go on brother everything will be fine and Absalon still hurting for what happened to his to his sister and david's lack of rebuke and what needed to be rebuked it was just superficial reconciliation amen no no talk about mending their their pasts no talk about going in and and cleaning out the wound note no talk about I'm wrong no no none of that I'll just give you a silly kiss or a pat on the back or a hug we don't like that I don't know why I grew up a man talking about things and resolving things right away why do we don't do that problems come up take care of them right away before they fester before they grow am I wrong amen you know what if you what if your spouse ain't meant but has there's been cheating on you and sleeping with other men or other women or whatever and they and they get caught and they just come and they just don't say well don't worry about it you just let's just move on come on just don't worry about it let's just move on what do you think that wife or that husband to think about about that how should they react towards that and yeah that's what we do with our children that's what we do in the church that's what we do with all these issues that come up we just sweep them off and don't get to the root of the problem don't get to the heart of the issue because it's just too much work you know saying I'd rather have truth I'd rather have truth Amen I'd rather be out there pulling the weeds and taking everything out that needs to be done and what's left if you do that it's true but we don't like that we like easy quick fix microwave solutions because because we don't want to go through the pain of deep healing the the consequences of David's silence towards eminence in against Tamar caused epsilon to grow roots of bitterness amen so epsilon he this whole time was resentful he was revengeful he was constantly reminded of the situation in one place in the scripture where it says that he gave birth to two he had some kids one of the children's name was Tamar one of his daughter's name was Tama he named them after his own sister he was reminded of what happened and then we over react so we got this bitterness in us we have this this bitterness and this and this hate in this things that are unresolved in us and we start acting in unseemly ways you know sometimes when when when maybe our wife or maybe our bender or our children they're acting in a certain way and they're giving you a certain attitude and you and the first thing you want to do is is launch at why are you acting like that what in the world what's wrong with you but then you but if you step back and say what is causing that in them so maybe maybe something is bothering them that's causing them to act like that and you step back and you see and you see what is it son what is it daughter what is it what's going on this talk and then you find out that it wasn't the superficial reason it wasn't for a superficial reason it was something deeper than that but because you find out if you take time when you don't take time and you want easy microwave quick fix solutions and you won't find out what the root of the problems are so and so and so this rebellion and all these things that this this hatred was in in an Absalon heart and in one place he he sets Joe abbs field on fire Joe I being one of one of David's uh captains or helpers I can't remember exact what he was and he because he's building all this hate and all this stuff like that he goes in and sets Joab fields on fire and then in another verse you'll find that Absalom was up there in the roof sleeping with with with David's concubines just trying to take it all that hate and all that bitterness taking it out on other people and other they're not at fault whatsoever why again because it wasn't resolved from the beginning it's just getting grow a bit growing bigger and bigger we think that time is going to heal it no and not in this case who are we a man to be different than what happened to epsilon but what happened to David all because David failed to act at a very crucial time instead of sweeping it under the rug second samuel 1414 you know what Saints I like what this verse says it says for we must need to die and there is water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither does God respect any person yet that he devised means that his banished be not expelled from him this is the person that came to David to convince him to let Absalom come back to Jerusalem and this is what he told him he said even God tries to do what he can to restore to restore and to have relationship with that person and man we read in Isaiah chapter one of the brothers career very familiar verse to us Isaiah chapter one God is concerned God wants your relationship with if I've always heard this if your relationships if your horizontal relationships are right then your vertical relationships will be right they say that again if your horizontal relationship is right your vertical relationships will be right the one with God but if your horizontal relationships are down the toilet how in the world you're gonna say that you have a relationship with God you can't wash this is God speaking through Isaiah wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgment seek righteous judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow come now and let us reason together I don't see it where God says come and let's just sweep it under the rug and let's move on come and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow God is already God is already well and what he's ready to forgive but you need to come to him you need to make that thing right be as scarlet they shall be as let us note though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land but if you refuse and rebel like Absalon ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it God is ready he's a merciful God he's more merciful and more gracious than you think why would he not want to restore that relationship with you when you've done everything you can to restore the relationship with others God's not gonna hear your prayer if you've got bitterness in your heart God will not hear your prayer if you have not made things right with the people that you know that you hurt oh they you lied to see because what and we're about to close religion is what man does to try to get close to God see that's what religion is is what what I can do to peas God but Christianity is what God has done amen to get closer to you and see God is the God is the one that advocates talking about things restoration going up and pulling out roots of bitterness and going down to the root matter of the issues he's the one that initiate that and why don't we do it and we're supposed to have the love of God why don't we do it that's the problem I'm gonna finish with this Saints the brothers could bring this up and you know Saints late later on we see that Absalon he rebels against his own father tri stic tries to to dethrone him and take over the connector kingdom and then you know the story and then Absalom gets killed by his own device Absalon dies all because david failed to do something at the beginning Absalon dies and Absalon and in david a man almost loses his kingdom causes more more problems in his family and in bitterness and all kinds of things all because he failed at the beginning to correct something he should have were corrected no matter what the people would have said and this is where I got this this title Amen I neglected thirst LeBron says I want you to see another great danger just before we close if you're not if you're not guilty of any of these things that I've mentioned and that is the danger of neglecting a thirst see you say I have a holy thirst but I'm not guilty brother or just go on joining church and things like this but see to neglect a thirst if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food you will die alright and if you neglect that thirst in you for God you will spiritually die all right you call for revivals you wait for your church to have a revival well that ain't that ain't over the revival for you the revival ought to begin right in you all right take these things and apply them to what we've been talking about when you begin to thirst for God there might be another member of the church way wanting that revival it breaks out in you it will break out other places see but see you neglect that thirst you neglect to do what you're supposed to do you neglect to milk the cow when the cow is the utter is full of milk and if you let that cow stay like that she'll go dry that's exactly right if you neglect to take a drink of water say I just ain't got to drink anymore you'll die you neglect to eat food you'll die so if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the Word of God you'll die because the Holy Spirit can't feed on nothing but the word amen maybe this isn't what you wanted to hear tonight maybe maybe somebody will take it and it might change their lives I'm tired of not dealing with things at the root level I'm tired of just living life and just sweeping things under the rug why why extend to our feet Lord Jesus as we come before you father God we thank you Lord once again for your mercy and your grace and your love thank you lord because father God we see these things we see these examples in the Bible we see father God the hurt and the pain and the suffering father God because of a failure father God of someone father to do something that they needed to do father neglecting father a neglected thirst Lord father God you forgive us Lord this our Lord cleanse us Lord Jesus father God because that's not what we want Lord and

Jesus father God we humble ourselves to you Lord Jesus father God we'll just give ourselves to you Lord you have your will in your way Lord I I just I had to I had to preach so I was on my heart father God enacted and so Lord Jesus you just do father God with your word Florida as you as you see fit Lord take it father gun and let it be rooted father God in the heart that needs to receive it Lord Jesus and change his father God his brother branham said in that prayer earlier Lord changes from the inside out Lord lettuce father God be willing Lord God to hit father God where things need to be hit Lord for the ultimate and go Lord God and that's to us to be right but God of mine help us O Lord are the God it's not easy Lord the Father God it's the best thing in the long run Lord Jesus you forgive me father if I've said something that I shouldn't have said Lord I don't want any any bad attitudes I don't want anything Lord God and father God I just plead the blood right now for each one of us here Lord and Lord asked father God that you revealed to us Lord God if there's something that is hindering father got our walk with God and and in the progress of this church Lord and and the progress of our homes spiritually Lord God then reveal it to us and show it to us and help us to be humble enough father God to make things right Lord Oh Lord Jesus I pray O God we love you yes that you'd be with the people now as they go home and we commit ourselves into your hands now Jesus Christ name Amen think sing something brother boy I don't know what you have praise the Lord create

thou that committed the sin there caused a lot of pain and a lot of suffering there but you know what since he still had to he still had to face the consequences of those things even though he was repented in his heart and he was and so be prepared to face consequences if you're engaged in constant wrong and you don't make things right then prepare for the consequences but there's grace there there's mercy there Christ is full of it Christ wants to give you that peace in your heart that you desire but you're still gonna you're still gonna face consequences ramifications of your actions
