punching okay father we thank you for this day the opportunity that we have Lord to just take a little time and sit down for a little bit and just talk about you and your great marvelous work and understanding and what you're doing in the last days among us we ask you to forgive our sins because we want to be covered by the blood and kept covered by it so just let that be there for all of us and bless each one you know the needs of the sick you you promised as you said you sense your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction and so just remember all of these that are sick among us have you weigh Lord and that's your light shine in our hearts Lord just let the understanding that we have need of because we need that more than anything else we have the word we can read it things but we need it revealed to us and we asked you to just have your way Lord and open our eyes to it guide us in Jesus name we'll start reading on verse 32 but before you do that I'll just read this one verse 13 now remember Hebrews 11 is the Old Testament Saints now you can enter relate to the last few verses and pick up God in this and that and bring in but that's fine that's that's no problem to bring in you know the New Testament part to it but mainly it's the Old Testament all right so then being in the Old Testament then we want to keep our thoughts into that line all right then it'll do so I'll read this one then we'll go into where we're going verse 11 excuse me verse 13 of chapter 11 says these all died in faith now we reread this one I didn't know where they were going to get that okay not having received the promises now all of these Old Testament Saints died in faith not having received the promises okay but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth now we'll go to verse 32 and start our reading for today what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon barak samson jephthah david also and samuel and the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed violent and fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised up raised to life again were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others at trial of cruel mockings and engorge NGA moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens in caves of the earth now here is almost a repeat of the one we read verse 13 now once and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise okay remember verse 13 see they they didn't get to promise all right these all died in faith not having received the promises well now what are you talking about see now watch them God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect you may be seen in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now what I want to do is because we preached on this not too long ago you know we're always doing that but I want you to lay into the thought of thinking about they without us cannot be made perfect so they're waiting on you and I all right now our thought for today is this God is waiting on you and I now see we're trying to pick it up to a higher order because we're gonna have to come through the Old Testament Saints and cover that right and come into that part and coming through the church ages and all to tie together all together but when we finish in the the ending of the message I'm saying that were that when you come to that you'll see what I'm talking about that God is waiting on us yeah but now now we're always waiting on him well well he might be waiting on us okay so let's take that thought in our mind but let's keep it together as understanding now that what we want to do remember as I said the Old Testament it says they could not be made perfect now we know that doesn't mean sinless perfection that is not what it's talking about it's talking about like Matthew 5:48 or B therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it means complete something is not complete alright we look back at those Old Testament Saints and we see that great things took place in great happenings and wonderful things and all like that and like I've always said we talked about we have the new birth and go look back at what they'd done without a new birth you know look at the things where they lived and what they'd done doing it by faith and then one of these days we will finally realize what and it says and the Prophet in fascitis so much that Abraham is the father of faith see then we'll see that there was something about it and I've always tried to express it this way Abraham was a man just like we are he was not no supernatural thing he didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost sure he could be anointed right that's fine and was and things happen and all I can't but yet still Abraham was just like a human being we know this thing didn't start was supernatural who who law faith are you following me this did not start that away because it had it started that away our women maybe was God started it that way but yet it fell away from his original plan but yet still his plan is coming forth and to be made manifested here and completed all right but my point of what I'm talking about see faith we look at faith and we try to figure out this and try to do that and all I can but just remember faith has to start by believing God just simply believing it doesn't start in a supernatural realm that's what I want you to get it comes into a supernatural room by the fact of starting in a natural realm and environment and time and people and things you know and looking back at them and saying look what they done without the baptism of the Holy Ghost well then you'll see why the Prophet would emphasize it like that he said if they could do that like that what about you and me with the baptism with the Holy Ghost all right but my point is one thing I've always emphasized this when I speak about Abraham Abraham was a man just like we are not a super-duper guy he just believed God God spoke to him one day said take your wife and he family get up and leave well there he was making a living probably was a real good living you know he was probably was doing great and he goes into his wife and he says honey packed a dud season wife said we're leaving there where we're going don't know well that would put her on the opposite side right because I see a tow I mean he'd have told her they were going down here going down here she might have had some ideas but she had no idea what he was talking about whatsoever and really in essence he didn't either because he's the one who said is he he left just believe in God get up and leave where would I go I'll tell you later that's the best answer that he could have got out of the whole thing right you get up and you start walking I'll let you know when you get to where you're supposed to be I'll tell you alright that's what we call faith that to me is what is faith see we look at faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for five faith we've we want to put faith as some great thing and it is don't misunderstand but it starts in simply believing okay now if you don't get nothing out of the message today you get that that brother Dale believes in Abraham was not a born-again believer he didn't have a super-duper faith to start with his faith increased as he went on his journey and one day he even had so much faith in God till he took Isaac up and was gonna kill him I can't remember what he said in other words he plainly said said I got him from the dead and if I have to kill him I'll get him back he knew that see that was his faith all right see we we want to look for something big some outstanding miracle of style of form of what we call faith well that's all right I'm no problem is it I'm just saying that to me that's not the way it starts it starts by you simply believing and accepting what God says and walking forward all right and walk yourself into it or if the Prophet said confess yourself into it all right now those Old Testament Saints as I said look at him out of all the things I want to emphasize this part right here because it is an odd situation to say that for without us they could not be made perfect now we know there's I said the answer to that it is not sinless perfection it's not speaking of that he's talking about they were not complete there was something about those Old Testament Saints that was never brought into completion all right now first off they never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it was promised yeah this was promised that was promised but they never received it all right they were looking forward to it but never received that all right so they were not complete are you in it it's not saying that wasn't perfect see that's what we want to lay on to that point but no it's not complete they didn't finish the thing that it was set out for them to do so they were not complete all right now follow that point and get that emphases in mind but get it in mind this way this is what I want to drive it they get it into the point that they without us cannot be made complete but look back at what they done and what happened there right and you just keep reading Hebrews 11 how does this and that and this than that and no and then you know we've got over the r32 and he says now what could I say more of this one and that one and this one remember if they're waiting on you and I then we must have the goods to produce if we don't come forth with that then the Old Testament does not come forth I know you can go back and ice all right you you get into what you want to about this and out of the other oven you know just get in mind what I'm talking about if it's so marvelous of the things that they could do with simple faith what's the problem with us in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll just believe in God and just saying thank you and just walk right on my healing I get I get by confessing it and walk it into it the Lord has touched me and brought a lot of this out of the way of the congestion 'z and the things and all this at the other they wanted to whack here they want to cut tire they were the only we're still all just forget it but my point is one thing it's always been that way with me and I want you to do that confess your healing when you're totally sick when you're just into beyond all things of the mind or comprehension of thinking about being well see then we put that owner well now it would be faith now if I seen it work well now that's James and Paul arguing with each other right you understand what I mean James and Paul when one of them looks like it's this way and the other one looks like it's that way and the prophet of God said both of them said the same thing Paul saying it's by faith James said it's by works he didn't say it that way the works his faith expressed all right now are you following my point C then Paul could make a confession but his confession must be the same confession that James made it's just lack of understanding all right now so they both saying the same thing all right so now to say they without us cannot be made perfect now I'm gonna throw a cog in the wheel right here in a hurry now cause I'm gonna reverse it they without us could not be made perfect right us without them cannot be made perfect now maybe you'll get the meaning of the word complete okay come on we're gonna read in a little bit where the Prophet says the Old Testament spoke of the new the new spoke of the old alright now you're listening and falling with me on the thought the then they without us cannot be made perfect it will not come to a completion without us all right now us without them cannot attain unto the completion the Bible is speaking off so we've all emphasized and we keep their facade colors gray of putting the dependence of Israel in the Old Testament nothing like a as to be upon us in the new birth that we have and that's great but now maybe you ought to think a little bit about the point what that we can't be complete without them so it's not just something that we're looking at it in the wrong direction that's why I emphasize what I always do with book of Hebrews you can take the book of Hebrews the eleventh chapter you read it down and all of it at Old Testament to open them you can get the last few verses you can interrelate a little bit into the New Testament but just remember either way right because now remember they without us cannot be made perfect all right those down to the seven Church ages are in the grave waiting on you and I right so they without us cannot be made perfect or complete right see if they're waiting this is wealth so everything is dependent upon you and I too as brethren we'll read a minute to not fail god it's dependent upon you and I to come to a position of confessing and walking into it we know for a certainty what through the Old Testament they did not have the new birth so they did not have a glorified body so they didn't have those type of things back in that situation alright but they must come to a place some day they tell how to be raised it had to be brought forth but the New Testament Saints with the morning again experience they have the new BIR but what are they liking the same thing the Old Testament likes in the basis that the Old Testament needed a change of the body we need a change in the body right see that's the point that we need that's what those that are down Paul Peter James John anyone you know there in the grave waiting on you and I to bring them out of that grave and for them to be made complete because the New Testament is not complete until you come to a total glorified condition body spirit and soul then everything there there's nothing in completion it's waiting and that's the emphasis I wanted to put see to where that we don't get our minds build up oh it's waiting on us you know get some glorified point that we think about no because just remember we'll read these over and over when we're getting I know angle and get through today so I'm sorry I'll get it next week but just remember God's waiting on no no no God's not waiting on us now he can just do anything he wants to he can't go contrary to his word he can't change his mind so if he says he's waiting on us then he's waiting on us alright see that is putting more back into the right line of us instead of making it could be something oh boy look look how we are all that's waiting on us man man we're something now we just plain old starting off like we started with Abraham we just starting off by simple of faith simple point of faith to believe God faith just to believe God see then remember these as we go along will try to read it in background it to put it in but just remember my whole point God's waiting on you and I will quote it after a wild with the prophets you know we're God's waiting on you and I adoption time winning pouring its fullness and do this I come on we ain't lost off of them the message so don't get old you know shaky fide when I say something's a lot of times people don't understand it they get a little bit and you know you get to jitters so don't get to chitters I try to put the end of it on to start with so they won't get to jitters I'm not meaning what your mind is portraying in your thoughts that God is waiting on us well if he says yes why don't we believe why don't we take it to me then see now those Old Testament Saints look what they went through not even having the new birth then come on in to the new testament in looking at the new testament people and the things that have transpired in the new testament form by the warriors of faith in the new birth and see that still that new birth didn't make them totally complete so the Bible's right everybody's waiting on somebody right then after we settle the whole thing God's waiting on us now that that order make you think a little bit of trying to decide what we're here for worth of ones that the Bible said the end of all things has come upon us right right on down in Hebrews 12 or what it right through that we're getting about by such a great a cloud of witnesses those Old Testament Saints are waiting those New Testament Saints are waiting we're gathered about by so great a cloud of witnesses waiting on us no wonder the Bible says how long how long come on when are we gonna start realizing who we are what's taking place I've thoroughly enjoyed the last ministries of you know this come forth here too because they've all been into a basics of more back to the bride and getting to the bride to realize who she is and what we're here for and what's going on I've thoroughly enjoyed that because that thrills my soul I don't listen seed a lot of people listen and they missed the whole thing luckily he said so I wonder what he man he said cell phone what do you mean what do you mean oh I'm scared he might confuse me just sat down and listened and if he says something wrong said poop there goes the seat this makes her run run said be careful it is received but you understand what I mean I'm not worried about getting deceived I have never been worried about getting deceived I'm worried about being to see telling that's the difference in there so you can be deceived and be right in the middle of everything and walking in the light of the love of God but just missing it just enough the word that it can be a problem I have no fear about somebody coming in and getting in here and spreading some doctrine I don't fear that I fear what the problem is is what doctors we got that's why you ever notice I'll say it you know we're not this one and we're not Loula eyes you know so just be careful only my eyes they always got in trouble all right but listen we know for a certainty what we're looking for so I so make sure you follow the line and then we'll go through it we have the new birth you know the point again experience eternal life in your soul and your soul can never be lost can never be and it cannot be deceived it can be hindered hampered etc but cannot be deceived one because it's God living in you but yet still here today we're lacking lacking everything like in his life and lacking is I don't have it all right we're don't have it at the situation a lot of time right season what is it that we don't have but simple we don't have eternal life in these human vessels is that any problem if you think you have eternal life in your vessel now I ain't talking about born-again experience of the soul we explain that now I'm talking about your body if you think your body's already eternal and boy the devil don't bother me I've got he whooped you you already gone you ain't looking to be deceived you deceive to start with right now in doing that then those Old Testament people was looking for the new birth right because he didn't have it come on I'm dropping back pick up drop back pick up they didn't have the new birth so they were looking for the new birth the promise that is in Hebrews of the things that we said are that they fail to get that promise that promise was the new birth it was promised to Abraham to come forth and brat that would eventually come forth into reality right but they would come to a new birth because that was the very point of God coming to die to release his life to give up and to come into us all right see then they never received a new birth till they're waiting all right no seed not get over into the new testament we pick up the point is we're emphasizing a minute ago we now have the new birth in a soul but we're still not complete we're still not complete because we're not finished we need eternal life in this spirit room that we're in we need eternal I've in this natural human body room that we're in by the new birth we have eternal life in our soul and will not never be lost or anything but yet we're just not complete yet so now look at the Old Testament site children that were not complete look at you and I were standing here today not complete so we're still dependent upon something to take place right to take us to a glorified state in body and spirit to match our soul as to that point so we're waiting we're waiting we're in that position we're I don't know what would be called a hold position or what but you know we've tried to explain this for years about the dimensions and things and and you know you got your life lot in matter then you got your fourth dimension there's like TV and things like that fifth dimension is the center did and I never have understood that one because five is a good number you know these days I'm gonna ask a guard about that because that five number looks good but yet that's the center dated no is in the fifth dimension the sixth dimension according to the Prophet is the dimension - where you going beyond the curtain of time etc and he went beyond the curtain of time and saw peoples are in that dimension and in that dimension would cover all of those who would ever receive eternal life because they're put in a place of hold all right you realize that if you read revelations were in the five read revelations five some time with real clarity of your mind and thinking and think about the you'll see then that even though they are sitting there as the 24 elders gathered around the throne they're still not complete that's 12 apostles 12 patriarchs that's the Old Testament that's the Nifty Testament that's all you want to do here and it's still not complete and what was it when brought around and went beyond the curtain of time he said must I go back there he didn't want to go that away right but those that had been there for a while we're longing to go back that's maybe hard we're thinking but is it true see brother Branham wanted to stay there he said do I have to go back he had reached a position that was really glorious to him but to those that was there they were saying how long how long in other words get something done and get us back over there we want to go back to our bodies so then just think of think with me about the point I'm trying to emphasize why would it be late relating always to say they without us brother dick always liked it this way he said Here I am today y'all perforates it but Here I am today really dick Addison he says well you know and I'm here they're waiting on us but if I die I'm waiting on them that's the point I see if I go on Python I'm waiting on you so get on with it that's the only thing that I've ever tried to say about anything that's all I've ever tried to preach always tried to preach one time hey let's get on with this thing let's don't fail is that what the prophets said about it he said God wanted this bride to realize that she wouldn't fall like Eve fell and that's something but I've got to point to you I hope we can get that back now later we'll do it next Sunday but for you to think about we can kind of comprehend the old testament waiting because they don't have the understand they're not a complete supposition new testament is not a complete position so there is a point their way but the hardest part is whatever reason I come to this point a few weeks ago and I wrote my notes and shut it down then I got to get to that because I've always emphasized and we've always said those things which you really think about how that God's waiting on you and I he's waiting on you and I then what's he waiting list to do some big supernatural thing some great big doing that's reason of enjoying these series waiters are doing about the revival because that's the way I've always believed it I've always believed that I've been in a revival ever since I come into this message no I've always been in a revival I've never had a position or a thought to worth it I was so down and out about the word now I have been down and out about you I've been down and out about me and all those things but I've never been down and out about the word never because as long as that word keeps on faith on unveiling I will never get tired of it right you talk about well I read this and I read that and one day I read it and it just jumped up off the page we'll see I believe the whole Bible is laying there like the haps you know I believe the whole message is laying there that away see I've never been down and out about the way things are going and in the world because now you know just be honest God always kept me and posted on to the future because you can argue what you want about it but he did because it's the I the first message I preached in this message was that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man in the last days and that's what your prophet said so you can argue him now it's not a part of phrases and already it's directly the bride will be the son of man the Word made flesh so then what if I what what could I be down and out about anything the joy is to see somebody asked me one time said what how does it make you feel when you stood back there that was 1969 and you stood back there and said the bride would leave these on I said it doesn't build me up and great glorious hallelujahs and all this ever you know I've never reached that when we wrote a recommend spoken words original CDs in one of these quotes he said now I got a big hallelujah right there you know maybe I've never reached that point myself to get a great big hallelujah but at least I can get a few amens in my own self you know to believe in the word all right but listen Church to realize that God is depending upon us I don't worry about we got to know here we're brother Branham says he didn't complete what he came here for right he is left for the bride to complete it it's in the notes so keep the notes if you don't read them you have it but listen these they're depending now let's just drop back start over roof low and let's just see and we'll read what the prophet has to say to make sure this you you'll follow it so we'll have a number one brothers and we'll start this to pulling up some things and reading them this is taken from Elle Cheshire dick the great French sand King when we rallied our with Abraham no who's just on them when we rally there in other words we gather we rally we gather around you know with Abraham Isaac and Jacob those who were heirs of the promise right but now look looking forward to us not to fail for without us they cannot be made perfect just take that without analyzing without running your mind and trying to get all this figured out and gonna just take what I've just read and think about it just read it some were we're gonna rally together connect whatever you want to call the wordings are with Abraham Isaac and Jacob I think we already don't already had a good connection because of that we are the heirs of faith according to Abraham's faith I meant I brought that in while ago right and said looking forward they're looking forward to us not to fail well no okay for without us they cannot be made perfect and how they're depending on us this morning let's not fail keep your anchor in Christ now those Old Testament son they're waiting on you and I now don't flop your mind and get over drunk cause I've been through this and it's been priests and we've got it well I believe it's correct way and if you don't believe it that's all right see you say well some of the Old Testament Saints well I'll just put the Quietus to the whole thing you say the Old Testament Saints raised you be careful because he didn't always I'm in the Bible for you at because the Bible said all of them didn't rise right so I'm with the Bible so now where you at you say yeah but some of these raise here well I'd remind you of one thing you get over in the book of Acts I think it is and it's speaking there says in David's suppli Chur never how you pronounce to put told or ever you got a big words or grave grave right David's grave is with us till today now that's the book of Acts well surely I think David would been one of them that raised wouldn't you you know raised with the Lord Jesus but it says he's in the grave waiting on us let's see we don't read the Bible that away we want to read it as to what brother so-and-so said and that brother so-and-so go ahead and say what he wants to me I'm studying the Bible my parts just come out of that let's see that that's why people say well we want we want to get her let's get away from the quote in the profit let's get with a Bible come on I enjoy I enjoy the Bible and a big man standing up in front of a bunch of ministers one day and he said I can take the Bible and tire you to pieces I said well you said you wanted the Bible so come on I said we'll meet you anywhere you want to be met I wouldn't bragging trying to be nice I was just telling the truth it was on marriage and divorce and I said we're gonna take the Bible and see what it says well you know what we never made a meeting okay I'm not bragging just telling it truth and you throw it back in somebody's face and they say well give me this I won't the Bible so okay that's what I want now you got them at a disadvantage okay but now listen they're depending on us this morning let's not fail those Old Testament signs they're waiting on us let's don't fail that okay go ahead number two this is taken from glorified Jesus how that those Old Testament Saints are looking now without us they are not perfect so they're depending on us to believe God's Word now they're too us to believe God's Word now I'm gonna say it in the hard way but if it's true that a revival is a revival of the word and not the great signs and wonders and everybody's looked for a revival to be all right and I believe that's true okay well then wouldn't it be that the Bible would be the revelation of Jesus Christ given to us with the new birth to be able to connect to those Old Testament Saints and in some way have to do with their resurrection are you thinking those Old Testament signs they're not gonna raise without us oh Jesus done that no we'll get in the Bible is gonna say Jesus done when Jesus raised the Bible says many of them right but it didn't say all of them and brother Branham emphasizing in the way that he'll bring it out he'll bring Abraham and all of them as the Old Testament Saints we just got through reading that now follow it go ahead to the next one perfection which would be number three perfection wonderful shadows of the faith not talking about the Old Testament people the heroes hero he of faith how by faith they did such and such a thing and how without us they could not be made perfect because they are of the shadow of this to come there are the shadow shadow is not a reality the things they done in the Old Testament is covered in types and shadows speaking of us right so then what's it saying they could not be made complete because they were living in the shadow and that's why Paul said that they died in the faith for not receiving the promise they never got the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in an Old Testament people I know see I I bring that out and I I realize that some to some people that's a new thought but you think about it Jesus Christ had not died back there and you can't how the death though you can't have the Testament without the death of the testator I'm quoting scripture so I'm not throwing off on those people and put them in the right position they're waiting on you and I because they are of the shadow the shadows not a reality okay go to number four make a new clock of Aaron I can even tell time then okay what was the Holy Ghost giving same holy spirit that saved the Lutheran's they sanctified the method Methodist that baptized the Pentecostal is now sitting in order to coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is far as resurrect now watch him what is the Holy Ghost Lucy you say well it's this a you're not listening to what he's saying he's putting his point back here that's what the Holy Ghost was far there will be a resurrection the his relation is back up here you're just relating what is the Holy Ghost without us without now may I see it what is the whole ego without someone with the Holy Ghost those prior who lived in another day and lived under that day they cannot come forth oh come on brother Dale God just go out into the grave said God was right no no he can't do that I'm sorry and the reason he can't do that is cause he said he wouldn't do it right I mean it's not that he can't because he can but he says it and then when he said that his word is binding him to the point that it has to come a certain way so what's it saying as I said to one there'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is far the Holy Ghost is the resurrection it's the life of Jesus Christ is eternal life oh now watch him what is the Holy Ghost without us they could not be made perfect without the Holy Ghost that's in you there's the New Testament bride coming forth with the Holy Spirit dwelling within her without that Holy Spirit dwelling in that New Testament bride those Old Testament Saints can't come forward because they don't have the Holy Ghost to match it right said don't don't just emphasize a point to where you say well God can do what he wants to he can't break his word he can't change his mind about his word when he said it that's the way it's going to be when when that first get many years ago 40 years ago my brother ran him on the adoption Siri said the whole world was waiting on the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God I had a future to look forward to but you see I've never believed brother Branham was looking to the future like most thing he was looking to the present tense I've always appreciated a way and that's where I believe it a born-again believer is not looking to the future they're looking at present tense looking to the future is fine that's alright we'll get there one each day but see that's a Baptist one day when we get to heaven we go have eternal life you wouldn't in the Baptist Church so you wouldn't the you said well what didn't I I never did understand what they were talking about because I thought they were talking about did I get eternal life but see there's it always somewheres else out under by the way we wouldn't run around them come forth he never spoke of a past I'm sure he did because he told what happened he never spoke of a future sure he did because there is prophecies but brother Browns whole message is present tense maybe you never thought it in that room its present tense to him it was right dark I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here is that a quote that what he said he said then we get into trouble looking at the pies we get into trouble looking at the future he said we fail to see what's taking place see that's what I'm hoping and praying because I've prayed for that ever since I've been in the message for people to get the revival that the revivals me could have always believed in a revival always have always believed I was in a revival do you say well I don't care it doesn't make nothing out of me I'm just saying what it is I've always looked it's something taking place and see that's why I couldn't get to the baptism of the Holy Ghost because I couldn't find it in the basis of it happening that one day brother Modi said stop what you're doing he said look to the promise that he said it and you believe it there it was that's all it took because he I found something positive there's no such thing as negative ISM in the gospel everything is positive oh we look back we look forward yes but what did the prophets say that that was our problem looking back or looking forward instead of looking at present tense now listen so what do you say they lived in one day okay excuse me where's that one number four we're still on it called I read part of it didn't you go back to number four yeah what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day under that we live in another day when the enemy comes in like a flood all the Spirit of God will raise up a standard again see they lived in another day as we keep looking back see then we're going to die and not achieve what God has purposed for us to do I don't mean to be sarcastic I don't mean to be hateful but I mean to tell the truth when God showed me that years ago and you know its own type for 40 years I've made this statement that God showed me that the biggest portion of people this message would die and go by the grave and I had no reference then none today of it being any problem against the fact except one thing they will not accept what the word says about him that's all I was referencing that's all God but he showed me said they won't be able to attain unto it bodily change you can argue what you want to you can say what he didn't tell you no problem I tell you I saw God not 11 years old you do what you want it ain't no argument i neva arguing nobody about it house there and see if we stay in another day then why can we expect God to move it at least move whatever we're doing move have some joy about it you know I mean if you think it's going to be this certain way have a joy about it being that way I am I'm happy about it going like it's going you know I've always been crazy too you know when they were saying well Hilary is gonna make it to profit I don't care if they put Hilary and another woman in there and he ain't got nothin to do with me but I'm happy about what God has revealed to me over the years that he's kept it to the basis that nobody hasn't been able to come in here and tear it down now if you show me in a sea well we've had a couple left though they didn't didn't like you we had one to leave to you still today got a letter ain't nothing against the doctors or nothing I'm just gonna find me a note pastor okay okay make your mind up and do what you want to do let's see we've tried to do one thing to stay with the word well let's see if I can get I still want to go so far okay let's get this and for certain number five the stature of a perfect man you get it these people who died in here now he's coming up to the New Testament okay it's reading I'm wanting to bring this up then we went through the Old Testament given the quote star of it how others laying in there and all if you want them but now we're gonna pick up to the New Testament form cuz listen to it you get it these people who died in here statue a perfect man or depending and waiting on us okay so this church has got to come to perfection completion finished in order to bring the resurrection and they're under sold under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when Christ does come go ahead how much the church now it's come up to a needle point until the church in the minority has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of a ministry that this left because when this headstone comes back it's got a little pocket life here where it's going to sit right in there on the regular fare meze on it's just isn't a count right on that sits across the top it's a little flat and it's got to sit on there and cause it sheds the water and when it comes this church has got to be honed all these rest the stones in the pyramid laying so perfectly until you can't run a razor blade up through here what appear mid-cap dusk when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be honed not only just some creed or doctrine or something other we come through it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together see then will come the rapture they're going home you say well what a brother Dale if you always look for that right there I've always looked for one thing for the people of this message to become alive in what they are hearing and what's transpiring and then it'll start a revival not moving not us going over here and running and doing I believe in that too that's good I love it but what is it a revival of the opening of God's Word do you see where I can stand and say 1969 when everybody else was saying this out of the other I said the brown of Jesus Christ according to the prophet will be the Son of Man the Son of Man is the Word made flesh not in one person its intent into our body me I don't mean this in disrespect I mean in truth so you say well we're waiting on that all right when we got to get that here then how do we do it I'm not sarcastic I'm telling it the best way I can tell it if you're saying there's got to be this or this person or that thing to happen then let's get on with getting that here well how you can do that pray and study your Bible is that the only way the Prophet said we can get anything quit looking at the Pais and don't look at the future would look at what's taking place well I don't see that there's for the part I don't see nothing if you're standing here in the book of Acts you wouldn't say you'd say that I don't see nothing because I've made a challenge to people it's kind of funny to think about take the book of Acts and write down how many miracles happen in the book of Acts and take this church over the 50 years of the book of Acts those are somewhere in our 40 something years right that you have to count calculate so far back here of say 30 years we'll just put 30 years and we can write off miracles that took place as many you understand now see it's not looking in the wrong read when brother Branham made that statement he says there's more miracles in one service than his written in the book of Acts or maybe he said in the Bible oh no you put that in number I think you spoke about some about his own ministry right one service more than in the book of Acts twenty thirty thousand outstanding miracles twenty thirty thousand conversions in one altar call the book of Acts don't even stand a chance I don't mean that wrong I mean it in the right side I was telling you to what you're looking at you read the book of Acts you read you hear the Prophet about these great things all right wonderful but just look around sometime just calculate I wish little brother Gary Atkins were still here because he would intended to do that one day he was intended to write down all of the outstanding things that had taken place and and we'd have them you know just a little church we've seen the dead raised to see he'll we've seen everything but blinded eyes open we've seen them to a point but we've seen everything that you could speak of in the book of Acts healings and signs and wonders right here in among us just a little group here do we believe that well you know I'm tickled to death when I get healed I don't know how you feel when I'm sick and things are going wrong and God comes on the scene I don't care I don't care who does the praying I just want somebody to contact God right we've got a woman a preacher down there work that you know I mean God here priors Rai didn't care to go tell her I say now we've got some problem in the church we've got a couple of people too sick would you pray for I didn't bother me you mean you'd go to a woman preacher and ask her to pray yes siree I'd go to the Pope of Rome and ask him to pray because I believe he could be anointed and touch God that's just how dumb I guess I am I believe that we're living in a day when the greatest of all things has ever taken place is here it's not coming is here I believe that we're a present tense in the greatest revival that has ever been the only said making make you mad at me I've been looking for this 40 years praying about it for 40 years or more talking about a revival because I've always had that in my heart a revival of God's Word they don't revive you for God to to speak to you about his you you know and tell you something from the Bible yeah these little kids can tell you sometimes ask them sometimes some of them might be able to tell us some things about healing come on musician I'll pick it up next week we'll try to go on from there but just remember what we've covered now we've covered the Old Testament trying to bring that up and seeing it will back up review and then we'll go to the New Testament but then where I want to get to that point that God is waiting on you and I so that'll show you exactly where I've hated where I've been headed for 50 years where I've been that pastor in a church here 40-something years and been looking for one thing not a world wide sweeping revival never looked for a world wide thought I could read your prophet said that's not what it is but a word revival a revival in our hearts about what God has revealed to us that don't get that don't make you feel good within to realize and know that God has placed within you and I the greatest opportunity because everything from your back is waiting on us and I'm gonna say at the best way that I can understand it and if God's waiting on us then he ain't back there I'm gonna say it right so you'll understand when I was referencing the God waiting on you and I he's not back under waiting on you and I he's out there waiting on you and I work now he's right here he's not out there he's not back there he's right here waiting on you and I to realize who we are and what we're here for is that anything contrary much time go over that reach out and touch snow that he passes you'll find he's not too busy here you see by the small your need to breathe down [Music] you might have an aide just remember what we believe he's here with us now he's not have died he died back there he's right here [Music] [Applause] if you wouldn't concerned I'm making care [Music] right Jimena somatic we've guarded the human element unity break in the morgue [Music] and then you went right back up here to [Applause] just keep praying [Music] pray pray yes [Music] it's lost you that insurance prior we thank you we know you're alright he just needs to weigh whether we thank you it's all finished [Music] in Jesus Amen anybody else's happily Beach and touchdown [Music] say that menu I want to give me that first off the enemy that's on that person we believe it because we've got to work in the name of Jesus it is asleep anybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] wait [Music] here that's what he's right now he's waiting on you and I to realize what's going on say thank you thank you Lord if we're looking out there we're looking back there mm-hmm look right straight it what you're doing if you're sick look right straight to God and say bye stripes I'm healed don't make no difference in you see what I ain't got no better I didn't know that had anything to do with it well when I get healed I'll confess I'm healed you're a liar cause you can't do it that away you're trying to prop up something Abraham don't fit nowhere and die abraham believed God and just walked out on what he said wouldn't it be something if you go home and walk in the house and tell you why I say pack the duds we're leaving where we're going I don't know who we're leaving and I wouldn't blame any of you sisters for saying hey at least you could find out the destination well we could pack clothes for it either winter or summer or whatever you know no just walk out and say thank you we'll see you it's hard to put your confidence in a something like that when you ask God about something asking believing believing in and they say thank you I thank you Lord for my healing thank you for my deliverance for this just remember we prayed our Wednesday night with brother directing them about traveling I'm sure it must be this week cuz they didn't leave so they're leaving going on their trip when this job be going probably almost two months or something so just pray for him the Lord would bless from God Father we thank you for this day and the opportunity that we've had we pray the things that we've said it has been according to you if not then you correct us we'll take care of it Lord we believe you we believe that you're right here now with us you're manifesting yourself among the little bride around the world and all we got to do is just believe it help us to be at least like Abraham that could take it against our hope and believe that it packs from hope into revelation and then we're all in a reality goddess nad will go either natural me or bring us back together and you were lovey and think in Jesus name you dismiss soon and very soon we are going to see you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
