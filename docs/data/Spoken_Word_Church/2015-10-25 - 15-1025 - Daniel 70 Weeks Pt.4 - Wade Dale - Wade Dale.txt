see they ceased altogether Brian heard her voice end of a woman in travail and the anguish that the burn that bringing forth our first shot the voice of the daughter of time that can you a little bit cell that spread their hands saying was he now for my soul is weary of murderers yep that's us so we see now just because reasonable reading Jeremiah I want you to see how how much Jeremiah music that is will have fallen away because remember 72 wins are to bring them back are are seventy times seven point so we see that Jeremiah we're going to go back into azran near mine just a few minutes but let's um let's Glenn get start a few minutes earlier pretty much everybody's here now let's start a daniel 9 read daniel 9 and yeah a lot of people are walking out on if you don't have one we go home so if I need one and these are all new ones they're not like the old book all right so if you got the one that's fine if you don't that's three up here and we'll keep two in reserve just in case but look don't give another one and you already got one just so if you forget one you got on here don't do that but if you forget one you can hit hard one of these alright so now paragraph 70 mi gotta say man the borrowed Ryan paid for these books or whatever he whatever he I tell you best night dude just put a couple of dollars in the collection plate America's we buy things hit church so that's what I always do if i use something or do something or you something out here like some paper we were using some paper loaded then we run out we come got something put ten dollars in the collection plate because it all just kind of and you don't have to just took ten dollars in the collection plate don't worry about it i mean you that's no big deal you're standing from church you're in trouble a look hey foreplay oh absolutely from the church i drive please pay I Drive all right now paragraphs NBA now what we're going to do is I'm talking two lambs and I get excited I like this brother Graham said he I've reading it last night he said on paragraph 89 he says oh I love to know what I'm talking about and people thought he was so wrong in the day of the week ok so a lot now let's get our dates let's start on our dates I'm gonna be slow and if I don't finish we're going to back up next Sunday and do it all over again alright because you gotta get this but I want you to do like I did hey i sat down for two hours last night and study put all these things together make sure my numbers were right make sure my scriptures is right do you do the same thing a couple outflow paragraph 78 not that works is now now we are told from the going forth of commandment now we are told from the going forth of commandment to rebuild the city two aside and Messiah was who Christ of course shall be seven weeks and threescore in two weeks making 69 weeks + 7 x 69 is 483 years if I got that same am now you getting it down if you want me to run over it again I'll be glad to do it now we are told from the going forth of commandment to rebuild the city to the massage Shelby 77 that's the first right here I believe he's pointing right here because remember that chart you got withdrawn on a blackboard behind him at the tabernacle so he's referring to the chart all right chubby 7 that's the first first right here seven weeks and threescore two weeks make 62 and seven is 6069 week 7 x 69 would make 483 years therefore until them aside now we're coming to this part now until the Messiah there's got to be 483 years I make up thats a man or an 83 years that's what's promised according to nail the Jews are restoring by temple worship build the walls build the streets and then Jesus is going to come on the scene and then he's going to be cut off that's what happens in this 483 year their makeup that all right now now let's back up just for a second because this is where it gets confusing to most people back up two paragraphs 72 same book just look over another page or paragraph 72 thanks night thanks 90 in your in your booklet all right got it gonna take a slow thanks hang out 72 now if there was seven look there's exactly 49 days he corrects that 49 years rather in the time of the building of the temple are seven prophetic prophetic wigs they're the key seven weeks because there was seven weeks determined to the temple to rebuild the temple and it was built in exactly twenty nine years now stop right there we got a problem you want to watch see what the problem is huh alright let's go to John to John chapter 2 now watch what's going to happen John chapter 2 and the Thursday that was American Cana in Galilee the mother of Jesus from them both Jesus was called in and disciples to the marriage when they wanted wine as mother jesus said to him well this again remember this is the this is Kanan all right he tasted the wine and and all that verse 11 keep going now verse 15 he may have scored your small cords and drove them all out of the temple this is the temple that's been restored during this 483 years okay and the temple was built in 49 years what says them what is my place we fixin have a problem we'll have to deal with because Jesus tells them that verse 17 is disciples remembered that it was written to the old I'm out that eating me up then answer the jesus said to him what sign shorts down to us Jews always have done something seeing that I'm doing these things Jesus answering said to destroy this temple and I in three days and in three days I will raise it up they say the Jews don't you think they know how long we took the bill that temple then just said the Jews 40 and six years was this temple Bell and will and well 46 years was his temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days but we know you're speaking of the his body right but now the Jews are saying it 46 years dance and we sit at 49 no very simple they started that they started building Jerusalem then they stopped then they started again so it took him 46 working years to build jerusalem but it took a 49 actual years let's go to let's go down Ezra in bill oven let's fill in yes all right well let's go to Ezra Ezreal tell you exactly what it is I'm going to use my Bible cuz I've got notes in my mouth Ezra one so if you got your Bible let's go to Ezra this is where a lot of people have problems with what brother Ron I'm saying so if we don't get done we just gonna start all over again now that is run chapter 1 i'll put it up here but because now watch Ezra and Nehemiah if you have a Scofield Bible look in your middle notes it says bc 536 now remember it could be off because most ninety-nine percent of the historians I don't know about us or how he got this but I've been going back there's a there's a website called endtime pilgrim it has nothing to do with a message this kind of the denominational Jewish denominational commentator and he's got it down better than ninety percent ninety-nine percent of the message people did all right Ezra one now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah will not be fulfilled what Jeremiah said 70 weeks you're going to be in captivity right but you're going out after those 70 years nobody understand that that was a literal happening 70 years happen back under of the literal time got it of what Jeremiah was saying but remember scripture has two meanings dual meaning alright same way would I am 70 weeks it's to the Jews but it has implications for us that the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled award stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia science of the Gentile he's not jus for he made a proclamation throughout all this kingdom and put it also in writing sayin the stash Cyrus king of Persia the Lord God of heaven have given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has charged me to build him in a house at Jerusalem all right we're getting close here we'll get started but he's not gonna finish it who is there among you of all his people he's got to be with him and let him go up because remember Cyrus is over enemies and purging he's over in Persia okay Jerusalem so far off but the Lord stirred him up because Jeremiah's prophecy stirred him up and this is the edit that most people go to our the commandment what who's there ammonia of his people here's God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem that Gentile knew he couldn't build that temple Gentiles can't build Jewish temple the Jews will not allow that to happen alright which is in judo and build the house of the work out of Israel he is the God which is in Jerusalem and whosoever romance in any place where he sojourned let the man men of his place help him with silver room with gold and the goods and the Beast beside the free will offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem they rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah Benjamin and the priests and to leave I see they're all out of their country you remember extra okay Esther is before this okay textures in 551 bc so she's before left remember the numbers go down as you get closer to Jesus this time so in 551 bc Esther and the king of Persia gets married and they allow the Jews to defend herself but they don't go rebuild the city they just scatter everywhere never I got there that's the hit they're scattered so this is cyrus now the next king probably in line he comes up and he's telling the people priestly vows with all them whose spirit God hath raised to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem everybody got that and then he's going to give them all this stuff and all this is going to happen so what happens is this is during the time of hoop Ezra right look Ezra this is ezra got it Ezra not near life Ezra alright got it daddy now let's turn to Ezra three we may just get this and stop that way it won't confuse you but you read next week read Ezra and Nehemiah that's too little bitty books but it's very important teresa has run in near my verse 10 and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord they set the priests and their peril with trumpets in the Levites the sons of ASAP with symbols to praise the Lord after the ordinance of King I'm David king of Israel all right and they sang together by course in praising you've been dancing to the Lord because he is good for his mercy and do it forever toward Israel Knohl people shouted with a great shout when they praise the Lord because the foundation was laid ok not finishing it but getting ready to get started alright got it the me recently live t fathers who were an ancient man that has seemed the first time when the foundation this house was laid before their eyes wet up with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy everybody got that so many of them they're rejoicing now watch chapter 4 now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple and says Lord God of Israel then they can to Zerubbabel rememberable was the first one to build this to start building on the temple and to the chief of the fathers and Senators they let us fill with you they look their adversaries they're not they're not kinfolk their adversaries let us help you build this temple for we seek your God as you do you're right and we do sacrifice unto him since the day the beasts are having king of a store which brought us up hither but it's a ruble and there's a man named Joshua and the rest of the chief of the followers of innocent of them you have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God unto our God but we ourselves together will be Lord God of Israel as King Cyrus king of Persia half commanded us now what happened is the devil he's right there then the people of the land Gentile weakened the hands of the people of Judah and judah and troubled them in building so they won't help them to start with yeah it's getting close to the troubles town but that's part of the trouble is time because that's the part of the city that's being built temple okay and hired counselors against them to frustrate the purpose all the days so what happened they just went in there and just started what anything and all these things you know started talking around all right now what happened and let's go to verse 24 let's skip all the other because here are you going to get your 46 years versus 49 verse 24 there's a another decree sent out and this stevo had my insurrection against kings and that rebellion seditions have been made there in other words he's getting frustrated I want to do this for sake of time he's getting frustrated all right now when the coffee let's go 23 now when the copy of King Artaxerxes letter was read before ramen sense i'll describe and their companions they went up in hastings original into the jews and made them to cease by force and power then cease the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem so it's east under the second year of the reign of darius king of persia so they stopped okay so let's make a long story short they stopped but it only took 46 years got it to build the temple let's just say we're going to build a house and me and Jim starts on the house would say we're going to get it done in the year okay all right our we're going to get done in 49 years like that we'd be old for 30 years and stop for a year we build for you know 15 more years and stop for a couple of years that's exactly what they were doing what happened was it's the people in the kingdom we just bother them trouble this time instead of them we're going to see that they built the wall with a with a trial in one hand and a sword the other why all these people here Jerusalem all these people started coming here maybe when God is fixing to do something you don't think the devil is right there so all those other princes and people that said they were going to do what they were going to do are now circling Jerusalem just like they're going to do in the end time ok now let's go to chapter 5 likes it read azra now here's another Prophet Haggai and Zechariah we followed the prophets home today prophesied under the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem and the name of the God of Israel even unto them then rose up Zerubbabel the sunshield hell and Joshua the sun's over there and began to build a house of dr. hill here they start again and then with him where the prophets of God helping them the problems just didn't set up on the hill they went down help all right now let's go to verse 16 I'm skipping through but it's going to give you something i'll give you a whole commentary in just a minute verse 16 then came to San shot spot just bizarre and laid the foundation of the house is hydrogen through them and since that time and even till now had there been building yeah it is not finished alright so they started building they stop they started building they stopped okay so there was your decree somebody comes back says we need to finish this thing to start building it again so there's your 49 they say 46 now that's final 46 actual years because you remember the Tuesday right down the day they start they write down the day they stop they write down the day they start you write down the next are and then in tradition down through the years they say well that took 46 years to build this temple and it did take 46 actual years but it was within that 49 years so now let me give you a little teaser here for next week now remember Ezra is a profit right brother I'm calling a blushing profit what happened was let's go to just read verse 9 for save time Goodwin don't have time read verse 9 what Ezra's telling them said look you've gone after strange women God's trying to bring you together right verse 1 now these things were done the princess came to me saying the people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people and doing according to their own abomination for their taken birth two of their daughters for themselves and their son so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands so Ezra is bringing them back together to quit building watching begin verse 9 for we were boiling yet our God have not forsaken us in our london but had extended mercy unto us in the side of the king of Persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god no if you got your Scofield Bible this is BC 457 that's a long time from when they first started and to repair the desolation thereof and to give us a wall remember you got a wall involved here but look Ezra has nothing to do with the building of the law as you keep Ezra only was given a proclamation to get them to start building that temple but the Bible says in Daniel 9 that it's the Jerusalem the streets and the wall if I got that all right now near my just for about two minutes read the book of Nehemiah if you look at your commentary the Scofield row 14 years after return of Ezra to Jerusalem do you lie to let up a captive species 444 so we're going to get into one more day which is going to make this all pattern out right because 538 BC will not fit anything it's in the damn 70 weeks brother branham told us and I were reading next sunny that somebody did use 538 pc he didn't say it verbatim but if you'll read between the lines and came out the 1919 he said well something did happen in 1919 he said but it's not what they said was going to happen cuz they use this day because remember that anything when they start when they get that wall finish that's the restoration okay and that happened in 445 bc if I got that so that's where we're going to start next Sunday Nehemiah and for 44 BC he comes up he's out somewhere whipped king with a king art disease see our artaxerxes if you read it read it you'll see verse chapter 1 verse no chapter 2 first one near my comes and pleads with the King to let him go and help them finish so they're up there just goofing off still they're marrying wise and then doing this and the Levites are not doing what you're supposed to do they're not a city there's buildings there but to remember the people or the city got it all right Sonia my is the one that builds a wall we got to go is the one that builds a wall and that's where we'll start next Sunday read Ezra and Nehemiah if you do that you'll find out all the secrets is coming up you give it a
