[20:48] to you in the name of Jesus Christ we
[20:50] pray
[20:51] amen amen Exodus chapter
[20:55] 23 and this is called in his favor
[20:59] and uh Exodus 23: 20
[21:02] says behold I send an angel before thee
[21:05] to keep thee in the way and to bring
[21:06] thee into the place which I have
[21:08] prepared beware of him and obey his
[21:11] voice provoke him not for he will not
[21:13] pardon your transgressions for my name
[21:15] is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey
[21:19] his voice and do all that I speak then I
[21:22] will be an enemy unto thine enemies and
[21:25] an adversary unto thine adversaries for
[21:28] mine Angel shall go before thee and
[21:30] bring thee in unto the amorites and the
[21:33] Hittites and the perizzites and the
[21:35] Canaanites and the hivites and the
[21:37] jebusites and I will cut them
[21:41] off amen so we're just and then we'll go
[21:44] to Proverbs 16 and verse 15 one one
[21:48] reading the scripture there it says in
[21:50] the light of the king's countenance is
[21:53] life and his and his favor is as a cloud
[21:57] of the latter rain amen God bless you
[21:59] you may be seated this evening and uh I
[22:02] just want to look at this thought
[22:04] tonight in his
[22:05] favor
[22:08] and the word favor has
[22:15] many
[22:17] means uh approval it means support it
[22:22] means or or liking for someone or
[22:25] something it means to Delight or take
[22:28] pleasure in in an act of kindness Beyond
[22:31] which which what is due or
[22:34] usual so favor and I want to look at a
[22:38] few things tonight and um the in the
[22:43] scripture you know when we begin to read
[22:46] um we'll see how uh the word grace and
[22:49] favor are used kind of interchangeably
[22:52] and um even even when we speak of favor
[22:57] you know we we see as uh as a uh
[23:01] interchangeable word you know we know
[23:04] that the word Grace means unmar favor
[23:06] unmerited favor of God and you know and
[23:09] brother bram's uh there in
[23:14] uh um invisible Union I believe it is
[23:18] where he talks about you know before the
[23:20] foundation of the world he gave us the
[23:22] wedding band of unmar Grace and you know
[23:25] talking about all the things but um if
[23:28] you've been reading in the uh in the
[23:31] church age book I know brother Wade's
[23:32] been going through this and um where
[23:36] where a kind of got this idea from is
[23:39] from the this morning church age brother
[23:42] Brandon was speaking he says he that
[23:44] hath an near let him hear what the
[23:45] spirit say to the churches of each age
[23:48] he said in every age it was the same cry
[23:51] hear what the spirit says he said if you
[23:53] are a Christian you will get back to
[23:55] what the spirit is teaching he said that
[23:58] is the word of this age he said every
[24:01] Messenger to every age will preach that
[24:04] word he said every fresh and true
[24:07] Revival will be because men have gotten
[24:10] back to the word for their age he said
[24:13] the Cry of every age is the rebuke you
[24:16] have left the word of God repent and
[24:18] come back to the word he said from the
[24:21] first book of the Bible Genesis to the
[24:23] last book Revelation there is only one
[24:26] reason for God's displeasure leaving the
[24:29] word and there is only one remedy to
[24:31] regain his favor back to the
[24:35] word so I want to I want to look at this
[24:38] tonight being in his favor and you know
[24:41] we look at the word grace and you know
[24:44] when we see the word Grace
[24:47] Grace brother Ram said Grace is what God
[24:50] did for us and you know you you look at
[24:54] this um and we won't look at a few
[24:56] things but you know Grace is what brings
[24:59] you to a place it's the grace of God
[25:03] that through you know because he said we
[25:05] are saved by grace through faith we're
[25:08] saved not of Works lest anyone should
[25:11] boast we know that it's Grace that
[25:13] brings us to a place because it's just
[25:16] like when you are brought to
[25:19] a brought it's God calling you into
[25:23] salvation calling you into the kingdom
[25:25] of God it's his grace that reaches out
[25:27] to you
[25:29] and brother bham said you know Grace is
[25:30] what he did for you but he said its
[25:32] works is what you do in
[25:35] appreciation so when we look about Grace
[25:38] but see having God's
[25:41] favor is something a little bit
[25:43] different well we kind of use it a
[25:44] little interchangeably but I want to
[25:46] look at this tonight because when you
[25:48] see
[25:50] this and you look at the even in the
[25:53] like the children of Israel when you
[25:55] look at you look at the life of the
[25:56] children of Israel just because they got
[25:59] out of the plan of God didn't mean that
[26:01] they weren't God's people God still
[26:04] didn't didn't mean that God done away
[26:07] with the plan and the purpose that he
[26:09] had for them the the mission that he had
[26:11] for them the commission that was given
[26:13] to them but they were out of fellowship
[26:16] and they had and they had to face
[26:17] consequences because they were out of
[26:20] their position so so the um the it would
[26:25] be um Grace is what brings you to a
[26:29] place so it's just like bringing you in
[26:32] into the kingdom as sons and daughters
[26:34] but favor is the condition of the
[26:37] relationship that you're
[26:39] in because even even as you know being
[26:43] parents we have uh we're we're parents
[26:47] and we have children well you know what
[26:49] just because they do wrong that don't
[26:52] mean that they're not our children even
[26:54] when we do God even do wrong that
[26:57] doesn't mean we're not not children of
[26:59] God God doesn't do away with us but he
[27:01] said because we we do wrong because we
[27:04] get out of the plan of God we do the
[27:06] things that are that are not pleasing to
[27:07] him then but then we face the
[27:10] consequences of it then we're chastised
[27:13] so we Face these things but see um you
[27:17] see the these things so it has to do
[27:18] with the condition of the relationship
[27:21] that you're that you're
[27:23] in and this is from this is from the the
[27:26] message of Grace and brother B speaking
[27:28] of love and
[27:30] grace and he said he said think of it
[27:33] love and grace is sisters twin sisters
[27:35] he said you can't have Grace without
[27:37] having love they're twin sisters he said
[27:40] that's exactly right he said before you
[27:41] can have Grace you have to have love he
[27:45] said before you can actually show
[27:47] somebody a favor you love them right or
[27:50] wrong you have to love them anyhow or
[27:53] you
[27:54] can't so if you're going to if you're
[27:56] going to show favor to them if you're
[27:58] going to do that see then you have to
[28:00] have Grace to cover
[28:02] them whether whether you're going to do
[28:04] that because he said love but you have
[28:06] to love them to have that Grace for them
[28:09] and he said if you can't have that then
[28:10] you can't you can't show Grace to people
[28:14] and that's what that because he said God
[28:15] so loved the world that he gave his only
[28:18] begotten son so that's what was given to
[28:21] us he said we can't he said we can't see
[28:24] one without the
[28:25] other he said love and grace is the same
[28:29] thing he said God so loved the world
[28:31] that he gave his only begotten son he
[28:33] shed his grace abroad in our hearts
[28:36] through the Holy Ghost see there's
[28:38] nothing you can do without working one
[28:41] with the other Grace the grace of God
[28:44] this is what saves us so here we are
[28:48] when we're talking about God's grace to
[28:51] us is bringing us in but when we have
[28:53] this Fellowship when we have this
[28:55] relationship then what do we do and
[28:58] appreciation or how do how do we handle
[29:00] that uh relationship is it shows how
[29:04] where we are and how how we plan to grow
[29:08] and how we plan to
[29:09] change because you know it's just like
[29:12] you know you uh you you do everything
[29:15] for your
[29:16] children and you you
[29:20] you to the young people tonight and you
[29:23] know I mean you have children and and
[29:25] you want the best for them and you try
[29:27] to get them everything that that you can
[29:30] and you try to tell them ahead of time
[29:31] of what's going to take place and what
[29:33] they need to do and the and the pitfalls
[29:35] and all the things but you know what
[29:37] they have to they have to experience
[29:39] that for themselves you have you have to
[29:41] let them go and you know what you can't
[29:43] I mean sometimes you know you you want
[29:45] to light a fire under them to get them
[29:48] to move but sometimes you know the
[29:50] problem is is you can't tie them
[29:53] down because in certain areas of their
[29:56] life they won't do nothing right and in
[29:59] other ways you got them where they're
[30:01] doing too much or they're they're
[30:02] getting into other areas and it's like
[30:04] you know you're trying to re them back
[30:05] on this because you know because they
[30:08] they're getting because they're into
[30:10] this time in their life where they're
[30:12] wanting to go out and they're wanting to
[30:14] experience things and they want to have
[30:15] they want to they want to know it for
[30:17] themselves well the problem is is you
[30:19] got to be careful about how you approach
[30:21] things because Satan will get in the
[30:23] details and next thing you know you get
[30:25] into certain situations that you don't
[30:27] want to ever being and you then you're
[30:30] allowing the Devil to start working in
[30:32] situations and all you can do is tell
[30:34] them and pray and and apply the token
[30:37] over them that they will walk the right
[30:39] way that God will show them because
[30:41] that's what it takes but you can you
[30:43] know when they're younger you can
[30:44] correct them and do different things but
[30:46] when they get a little bit older you
[30:48] know
[30:50] um you don't know what to do
[30:56] sometimes I mean I got I got two boys I
[30:59] love to death
[31:02] but
[31:04] sometimes but you know the thing is is
[31:07] what what
[31:09] what
[31:11] what what was that are y'all talking
[31:13] about something
[31:15] okay they're joking over here about
[31:18] stuff
[31:19] same yeah
[31:23] okay yes we uh I tell I'll tell a little
[31:27] story I tell I tell tell stories except
[31:28] on me uh Richard Richard said I like
[31:31] tell stories on everybody else but I
[31:32] don't like to tell stories on myself and
[31:33] I told Richard like I've told Richard
[31:35] before if you ever preach you can talk
[31:36] you can tell stories on me
[31:39] but until then you know what you'll just
[31:41] have to tell people in
[31:44] person but you know we we used to go we
[31:47] used to go eat at Cracker Barrel with uh
[31:50] Donnie and Susan and uh they used they
[31:53] used to say that uh brother Donnie was
[31:56] uh one of the other kids hand to watch
[31:58] out for too
[32:00] cuz we don't we don't we don't know if
[32:02] he was getting dragged Along by the kids
[32:03] or he was D dragging the boys
[32:08] along Susan would have to get on to him
[32:10] think more than we had to get on the
[32:13] boys but they had but they had a good
[32:15] time you
[32:17] know but you know all of the things but
[32:20] you you look at things in your life and
[32:21] you see the things that you've went
[32:23] through and you see the struggles and
[32:24] you've seen the heartaches that You'
[32:25] faced and all you do is you try to tell
[32:28] somebody that you don't want them to go
[32:30] through those same things you try you
[32:33] try to stop them and you know I really
[32:36] appreciate somebody that can stand up
[32:37] here like brother Wade was talking about
[32:39] brother John coming up here and and
[32:42] giving his testimony and showing all the
[32:44] struggles that he's been through him and
[32:46] sister Alicia and all the things that
[32:48] they've had to face and all the
[32:49] heartaches you know it's been a real
[32:51] struggle but you know what God has
[32:52] brought them through I mean that's a
[32:55] real blessing to see what God has done
[32:57] for them and it's like well you know I I
[32:59] struggle with this and I struggle with
[33:01] that but you know what you I've never
[33:03] ever ever in my
[33:06] life and all the things I've been
[33:08] through I have yet to find a time when
[33:12] I'm looking and I'm searching I get down
[33:15] and you know I I can't tell you any time
[33:17] in my life where I hadn't seen a witness
[33:19] where God has come through and brought
[33:21] people through the exact same
[33:26] thing and you know because you know if
[33:29] God because God wants you to know that
[33:32] there's some if he's real then there's
[33:34] always been somebody that he's brought
[33:35] through the exact same well I'm I'm out
[33:38] here on an island by myself and I I'm
[33:40] facing this and and you know what and
[33:42] there's people that's come the same road
[33:44] that you have has faced the same Devils
[33:47] that you have fought and you know what
[33:49] and they have
[33:53] overcome you know even even ones that
[33:55] people think is just uh just you know
[33:59] amazing and and if if you don't mind I I
[34:02] want to share this and I was thinking
[34:05] about this the other day and you know
[34:08] this woman his sister she had she had
[34:12] these children and her husband had run
[34:13] off and and left her and left her left
[34:17] her with all these kids and she trying
[34:18] to figure out and she just you know
[34:20] struggling and scraping by just trying
[34:22] to make a
[34:23] living but you know what she was
[34:25] faithful to the house of God she was
[34:28] faithful to the
[34:29] word now now now God don't wouldn't I
[34:32] mean God's not going to do this for
[34:35] everybody I mean because you know the SI
[34:39] situations that happened but you know
[34:41] she went she she struggled she went
[34:43] through all this went through all the
[34:44] heartache trying to raise kids and
[34:45] everything like that and you know after
[34:47] she went through all of that you know
[34:50] God took her husband off the
[34:54] scene but you know what she didn't she
[34:56] didn't try to get out of her place or do
[34:58] anything like that she just tried she
[34:59] just tried to live the best Christian
[35:01] Life that she could and and all of a
[35:02] sudden God brought her a husband that
[35:04] helped her with the children was able to
[35:06] support her she had a great home life
[35:09] and all this kind of stuff and you know
[35:11] what but she didn't give up on God she
[35:13] didn't know how things were going to
[35:15] take place but you know what she just
[35:16] kept on going because you know what God
[35:18] said that he would always be her
[35:20] provider but you know what you know and
[35:22] it's not going then that won't happen
[35:24] for everybody but the thing is that she
[35:26] made up her mind the first thing she
[35:28] made up her mind that she was going to
[35:29] seek the kingdom of God in his
[35:31] righteousness and all of the other
[35:33] things would be added unto her she
[35:35] wouldn't worry about those things
[35:36] because you know what she knew that God
[35:38] would be her husband God would be her
[35:40] provider and you know all she had to do
[35:42] was put her trust in that now there was
[35:43] a lot of times that she went through a
[35:45] lot of heartaches and a lot of
[35:47] loneliness but you know what she could
[35:48] stand up and say God brought me
[35:51] through and so there's so many how many
[35:53] people have have been at at death's door
[35:56] and we we see how many people that God
[35:58] is touching they say well you know I
[36:00] struggle with this and and I have this
[36:02] problem and you know this is rare or
[36:03] whatever but you know what God
[36:06] Specializes in things thought
[36:08] impossible when it gets to the place
[36:10] where you think well I I'm not ever
[36:12] going to be able to get over this I'm
[36:13] not going to be because you know there's
[36:15] only a few cases of this disease in all
[36:17] of the
[36:18] world well then guess what God is the
[36:21] one that came and spoke everything into
[36:25] existence and then you know what he said
[36:27] every everything in motion and every
[36:29] devil in hell is bound by his power he
[36:33] he only permits these things to take
[36:35] place everything works according to his
[36:38] will everything works according to his
[36:40] word so if there's only two or three
[36:43] then guess what then you're the one that
[36:45] has the opportunity has the power to
[36:47] overcome it to show that the devil
[36:50] because you have the power right to
[36:53] cause the healing to take place in your
[36:55] body
[36:58] you know brother Brown was I was
[36:59] listening to brother Brown the other day
[37:00] and he was and he was talking about the
[37:01] prayer lines and you know he said you
[37:03] know and talking about Jesus said and
[37:05] and and uh the scripture he said you
[37:07] know that he said the son can do nothing
[37:09] of himself except what he seeth the
[37:10] father do that doeth the son likewise so
[37:13] he was only showing what God was seeing
[37:15] that God showed him that's what he done
[37:18] and he was talking about being in the
[37:19] prayer lines you know what God shows him
[37:21] he said I can only tell you but anything
[37:23] else he said I can just tell you what
[37:24] the word says but if he shows me
[37:26] something I'll tell you what what he
[37:27] showed
[37:29] me because he said he said if you're
[37:31] healed and I see that you're well then
[37:33] guess what you're well but I I Ain come
[37:35] up here and pray for you but I can't
[37:37] heal
[37:38] you but he said you have the same
[37:40] opportunity when you come in the prayer
[37:42] line and you stand there he said you had
[37:44] the same opportunity just like the woman
[37:47] with the issue of blood did when she
[37:49] came up there and she didn't have no
[37:51] scripture she didn't have anything but
[37:53] she had in purposed in her heart she had
[37:55] the thought she had she came to this
[37:58] place that she said if I can but Touch
[38:00] the Hem of His Garment I'll be made
[38:02] whole and that's exactly what she done
[38:04] and he said if you come up here and
[38:06] believe see that's all you got to do
[38:07] when you come up here then if you come
[38:09] up here to get prayed for then all you
[38:12] got to do is
[38:14] believe then you know what then all
[38:16] these other people have come through
[38:17] there and God has healed all of
[38:19] them and look at all the Miracles that's
[38:21] taking place when you come up there you
[38:23] got the same
[38:25] opportunity he's right here to meet your
[38:28] need
[38:29] am and he said you know you don't need
[38:32] me to do
[38:35] that God placed the gift in my life
[38:37] brother Brandon said you God placed the
[38:39] gift in my life but you know what I've
[38:41] got to get you to believe if you will
[38:43] believe because he said Jesus Christ is
[38:46] the Healer so if you can believe what he
[38:49] said he's the one that has the answer
[38:52] he's the one that's the deliverer if you
[38:54] will put your trust in him and believe
[38:56] what he said
[38:58] then you can have whatever you have need
[39:04] of I just want to I here I want to read
[39:07] these scriptures right quick just got a
[39:08] couple of them Psalms 11:27 it says he
[39:12] that diligently seeketh good procureth
[39:15] favor but he that seeketh Mischief it
[39:18] shall come unto
[39:20] him so if you diligently seek good you
[39:24] procureth favor so as you seek good if
[39:27] what is good the word if you're seeking
[39:30] God if you're diligent because he said
[39:31] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[39:33] seek him so if you you must believe that
[39:36] he is and he is a rewarder of them that
[39:38] diligently seek him so if you're seeking
[39:40] God then you know what you procureth
[39:41] favor from God then you receive the
[39:44] favor of God Psalms 12:2 says a good man
[39:48] obtaineth favor of the Lord but a wicked
[39:51] but a man of wicked devices will he
[39:55] condemn so you see that if you do a
[39:59] certain thing then you gain the favor of
[40:02] the Lord then there's a positive that
[40:04] comes out of it but if you don't then
[40:06] there's a negative that comes out of it
[40:09] so there's something that takes place
[40:10] because that is what we
[40:12] do then it's based on what we do in
[40:16] Proverbs
[40:19] 3 verse
[40:21] 1-4 it says my son forget not my law but
[40:25] let th thine heart keep my Commandments
[40:28] for length of days and long life and
[40:30] peace shall they add to thee let not
[40:33] mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them
[40:35] about thy neck write them upon the table
[40:37] of thine heart so shalt thou found favor
[40:40] and good understanding in the sight of
[40:42] God in man so these different scriptures
[40:46] that we can read in the scripture
[40:47] because it tells us if we want the favor
[40:49] of God if we want to be in his favor
[40:51] then there's things that we can do to be
[40:53] that to get in that and he was saying
[40:55] see the word is if you will get into the
[40:58] word and you will follow the word then
[41:00] these things will take
[41:01] place and this is from the this is from
[41:04] the message testimony brother R speaking
[41:06] and he's and he's getting ready to pray
[41:08] and there I believe he's getting ready
[41:09] to do the the prayer line and he was and
[41:11] he says and he
[41:12] said and May in speaking May great signs
[41:15] and wonders Break Forth and may this
[41:18] whole audience Break Forth forth for
[41:21] that Living Water springing up like
[41:23] geysers out of the soul lord that you
[41:26] told this Samaritan woman about and may
[41:29] we lay our tired weary Souls at your
[41:33] feet tonight and drink until we P bathe
[41:36] in the beauty of God until we forget all
[41:40] about this sense bound existence and
[41:43] move out yonder into a place where the
[41:46] Spheres beyond the stars where we can
[41:48] find favor with God find healing for our
[41:51] bodies and rest for our souls so there's
[41:55] a place that we can go to because all
[41:57] we've got to do is press into him and
[42:00] because he's here tonight and if we
[42:02] gathered here tonight then whatever you
[42:04] have need of then he's here to meet your
[42:05] need tonight so he's here and he said
[42:08] see then we can come in and we can drink
[42:11] and and bathe in this in the beauty of
[42:13] God that we can and and just as as
[42:16] brother Wade was speaking the the other
[42:18] day and he was talking about you know
[42:19] what he said I come out here and he said
[42:21] the whole place look milky well you know
[42:23] if if that happened once you know then
[42:26] then why can't it happen again that that
[42:28] the whole place just becomes so full of
[42:29] faith that it looks so you see the
[42:32] presence of God moving in the place that
[42:34] he becomes visible among us see that
[42:37] that is not just something that happens
[42:38] one time and you're like oh that was
[42:40] wonderful you know what we can have that
[42:42] all the time you can see that more often
[42:46] instead of just having it happen one
[42:47] time see but if we come in here and it's
[42:49] like well let let's just get Beyond
[42:51] brother ra says get beyond our sense
[42:53] bound existence why because you know we
[42:56] come in it's like well it's just going
[42:57] to be brother Aon up here and he's just
[42:59] going to he's just going to read some
[43:00] quotes and he's just going to say a few
[43:02] things or whatever but you know if it's
[43:04] just that then you know what then you'll
[43:05] walk out of here defeated you'll come
[43:08] out of here just sad you'll just go
[43:10] right back out the same way you came in
[43:12] but you know if we ever come in the door
[43:14] and we say you know what I'm going to
[43:15] meet with the with the God of all
[43:17] creation with with Elohim with with the
[43:19] one that created all things and and put
[43:21] everything into existence and he's the
[43:24] one that came and spoke to me in my
[43:26] lowest point in the darkest dungeon of
[43:29] sin he come and called me out and
[43:31] brought me into Marvelous Light and he's
[43:33] brought me to this place and he's
[43:35] delivered me and you know what if he's
[43:37] brought me to this place and guess what
[43:39] he will continue to lead me and if he's
[43:41] done it one time then praise God he's
[43:43] got more for
[43:45] you amen and it doesn't it doesn't
[43:49] matter who the you know who the person
[43:51] is that's preaching you know it's we got
[43:54] to get Beyond just human uh you know or
[43:57] just you know personalities and things
[43:59] like that because you know we'll allow
[44:01] those things to get in our way and it'll
[44:03] hinder our growth it'll hinder our
[44:05] experience with God and we wonder why we
[44:08] can't go beyond a certain point while
[44:10] we're while we stay at a certain and get
[44:11] in a certain rad because we've allowed
[44:14] things that the devil to play
[44:17] in you know it's so it's so it's it's
[44:21] terrible to see you know some well you
[44:22] know I I you know I don't want to
[44:24] fellowship with that person and you know
[44:26] I don't listen to that person or
[44:28] anything like that and it's like you
[44:30] know maybe just
[44:33] maybe if we get beyond the point and I'm
[44:37] not I'm not speaking to anybody here or
[44:39] anything like that but you know there
[44:40] there's times you see people uh you know
[44:43] people they go to
[44:45] church and and y'all know I'm just I'm
[44:47] just I'm just telling what I'm just
[44:48] telling the truth I ain't pointing no
[44:49] fingers nothing but you know there's
[44:52] people that go to church and they go to
[44:53] churches and you know what and they want
[44:55] they walk out a different door than some
[44:57] somebody else cuz they don't want to
[44:58] have to shake their
[45:03] hand but we you know we're we're ready
[45:05] to go into
[45:11] Rapture and what kind what kind of what
[45:14] kind of spirit is that and we wonder we
[45:17] wonder why the the why the church can't
[45:19] grow why the church can't
[45:21] advance and it's like you know just like
[45:24] brother randam said you know they said
[45:25] well brother R teach teach these great
[45:27] spiritual gifts and let let's let's
[45:29] preach on these great wonderful things
[45:30] and let's open the doctrines and and let
[45:32] let's preach these things where and he's
[45:34] like well how can I preach these things
[45:36] to people he said if they won't learn
[45:37] their
[45:39] ABCs he said if you can't if you can't
[45:41] love one another he said he said how you
[45:44] know if you can't how you love God if
[45:45] you can't love your brother how can you
[45:47] love him that you've not seen if you
[45:48] can't love the one that you have
[45:52] seen amen if we can't love one another
[45:55] with all our faults and failures and
[45:57] realize you know what I got faults and
[45:58] figures
[45:59] too and you know what I want you to make
[46:02] it and I want you to overcome what
[46:04] you've got but you know I don't want to
[46:06] stand in your way and if I stand in your
[46:08] way and if I'm your hindrance then you
[46:10] let me know
[46:12] amen then I'll come and apologize to you
[46:15] I'll apologize up here it don't matter
[46:17] to
[46:19] me if I get out of line then I don't
[46:22] mind doing
[46:24] that and I have before
[46:30] and you know but why because it's if if
[46:32] if I if I have this test if it if it's
[46:35] in my heart then you know what I'm I
[46:37] want everybody to know Hey listen I've
[46:39] got a
[46:40] problem and I don't mind I don't mind
[46:42] standing up here and being corrected by
[46:46] it because you know some people will
[46:48] stand up and and they don't mind
[46:49] pointing the finger at people but if you
[46:51] say anything to them then you know they
[46:53] get all upset and get been out of shape
[46:55] about things right
[46:57] and you know what then the church and
[46:59] the church can't grow the church can't
[47:00] be productive the church is is not going
[47:03] to get to the place that it needs to be
[47:05] because it'll you're hindering
[47:09] it but see the thing is is do we want do
[47:12] we want God's
[47:17] favor see brother BR says here he says
[47:20] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[47:22] righteousness he said then these other
[47:25] things will be added he said I'm happy
[47:26] for that he said we all want to find all
[47:30] the favor with God that we can find
[47:32] because we need all the grace that he
[47:34] can bestow upon
[47:36] us we need all that we can get from God
[47:40] I want all of his I want all of his
[47:43] favor I want everything that he can get
[47:45] but I want to go in the direction that
[47:47] God calls me to
[47:49] go and you know here in the in the
[47:52] scripture we we see you know brother
[47:54] Brown was speaking and uh several
[47:57] different different places he covers
[47:59] this but he was talking about Cain and
[48:01] Abel when they come out of the garden
[48:04] and you know here they are they come out
[48:05] of the the garden and they they know
[48:07] that they they can't go back into the
[48:09] garden because they've been cast out and
[48:11] you know there's a way and they have a
[48:13] desire to go back and because they they
[48:15] know that they want brother said they
[48:17] wanted God's favor because they wanted
[48:19] to go back to where they came from
[48:22] because there was a there was a because
[48:24] there was a Chasm between them and God
[48:26] you know and he said he said because
[48:28] they knew that where they were at and he
[48:30] said he said they knew that they were
[48:31] mortal and they were dying and and they
[48:33] were under this burden he said they
[48:35] desired to go back to God and they were
[48:37] working their way back to that and he
[48:40] said you know and because they knew
[48:42] where they came from he said they wanted
[48:43] to worship God because they knew that
[48:45] they had to get back to God and that's
[48:47] how they could get back to God was to
[48:48] worship
[48:50] him and so you know they had this desire
[48:52] and here they go back to worship God and
[48:55] you know here they they go in there and
[48:57] they want to set up the Altar and
[48:59] worship God and and make their
[49:01] sacrifices and everything and you know
[49:03] brother Bram said that Kan wasn't an
[49:06] Infidel you know he was a real
[49:09] believer he had he was a Believer you
[49:11] know he just didn't come in there and
[49:12] say well I'm just going to do this no he
[49:15] really had it in his heart brother R
[49:17] said that they wanted to go to God and
[49:19] he really wanted to get to that place
[49:22] and you know but see he he wanted to do
[49:24] that he wanted to find Grace and he
[49:25] built his Altar and and he came to
[49:27] worship and all these things and he done
[49:29] all but the problem was he did not have
[49:31] a revelation and we know that Abel had a
[49:35] revelation and you know that he what
[49:38] what to do God give him that revelation
[49:40] of what to do and that's what Abel done
[49:44] he went in there and done those things
[49:46] and began to
[49:47] worship see brother says he said I
[49:50] believe Kain come with a full heart
[49:53] thinking he was doing right he said he
[49:56] see he was trying to find favor with God
[49:59] he was trying to find life again he was
[50:01] trying to get back to the Garden of Eden
[50:03] where the cherubims was see he said all
[50:06] he said I'm going to find favor with God
[50:08] he said I believe God he said I want to
[50:10] find favor with God so he was doing all
[50:12] these things but without a revelation
[50:14] the only thing that he could see was
[50:16] bringing the best that his uh labors
[50:19] would bring all of his tools all the
[50:22] things that he knew how to do that's all
[50:23] he knew how to bring to God but you God
[50:27] told him said no that won't be
[50:29] accepted but you know he gave Abel a
[50:32] revelation because Abel was by election
[50:35] Abel was selected and he give him the
[50:37] Revelation that it was going to take
[50:40] blood and so he brought he brought the
[50:43] uh lamb up there bring dragging this
[50:46] lamb up there and here he is bringing
[50:49] this lamb and comes up there and and you
[50:52] know no doubt Cain is standing there
[50:54] trying to figure out what in the world
[50:55] are you doing
[50:58] and so here he is he's bringing this
[50:59] lamb and and he's taking this knife or
[51:02] rock or whatever it is and you know he's
[51:04] up there and he's you know going at this
[51:07] Lamb's neck and he's trying to kill it
[51:09] and and cutting it and just continually
[51:11] just pounding on this thing and you can
[51:13] imagine him just standing there trying
[51:15] to cut that Lamb's neck trying to get
[51:17] that the blood out of that thing and
[51:19] he's just pounding away just why because
[51:23] he wanted to get to the he knew what God
[51:25] required and he was going to do that and
[51:28] Cain standing there looking at it trying
[51:30] to figure out what in the world are you
[51:31] doing that don't make sense at all but
[51:35] you know what Abel went through with
[51:36] that and no doubt Abel and Cain talked I
[51:39] mean I don't think it was just like that
[51:40] they you know coming right out of the
[51:43] blue but it still it never could it
[51:45] never could get in in Cain's mind he
[51:49] never could comprehend
[51:51] that but you know he went out there and
[51:53] Abel slew that lamb and you know made
[51:55] the sacrifice and he went out there and
[51:57] he began to worship God and you know he
[51:59] wanted God's favor and you know he
[52:00] wanted to re get back in in fellowship
[52:03] with God and he wanted to do what God
[52:04] wanted him to do and and Cain standing
[52:07] there and in that whole midst of all
[52:09] that and he was standing there and
[52:10] couldn't figure out why all that was
[52:12] going on but you know God told Cain he
[52:16] came to Cain and he told him he said
[52:17] listen he said if you will go and do
[52:19] those
[52:21] things he said if you will go and do the
[52:24] exact same thing as your brother
[52:26] he said that's all you have to
[52:30] do he said brother Ram says he said now
[52:33] the only way that that boy could have
[52:35] ever done that talking about C uh Abel
[52:38] see he knew that he was the right
[52:40] sacrifice it had to be a spiritual
[52:42] Revelation from
[52:43] God he said it's it's been every since
[52:46] spirit it's been every since spiritual
[52:49] TR revealed truth right how God in his
[52:52] Mercy through the operation of the Holy
[52:54] Spirit reveals spiritual truth the word
[52:57] itself he said if you're trying to read
[52:59] it from some educational standpoint you
[53:02] just read it like you're trying to re
[53:03] figure out mathematically something but
[53:06] if you read it after but if you read it
[53:09] after you received Christ in your heart
[53:11] it's a brand new book again it's a love
[53:14] story God writing to you it's
[53:16] spiritually revealed amen he said God's
[53:19] church is absolutely a spiritual
[53:20] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[53:24] said and no man can receive it by his
[53:25] own desire
[53:27] no man can come to me except my father
[53:29] draws him first see it takes the Holy
[53:31] Spirit to bring you to that place and he
[53:34] said he said he that comes to God by the
[53:37] Holy Spirit draw Jesus said I will in no
[53:40] wise cast
[53:41] out see you have to follow what God has
[53:46] led you to
[53:49] amen you know here's here's Abel he
[53:52] didn't have anybody verbally speak to
[53:55] him
[53:57] but
[53:58] obviously Abel probably did speak to him
[54:01] but we know that you know he heard what
[54:03] God had told him he by the Revelation
[54:05] that God had given Abel done what God
[54:07] wanted him to do but here he is when he
[54:09] sees this taking place and he realizes
[54:11] that God has accepted Abel's sacrifice
[54:14] and God comes and tells Cain listen all
[54:17] you've got to do is like your brother
[54:19] and you can be accepted too he made the
[54:22] he give him the
[54:23] opportunity he's looking for the favor
[54:25] of God and there's the opportunity for
[54:27] him to do that but because he wouldn't
[54:29] do
[54:30] that well you know I don't I don't want
[54:33] to I don't want to do
[54:35] that I I just don't see that being
[54:39] necessary I I I I I assume I feel that
[54:42] my uh sacrifice should be accepted I
[54:46] think this
[54:48] suffice but that's not what God told him
[54:50] God told him said listen you need to do
[54:52] this right and you've seen it take place
[54:55] and you've seen you've seen the favor
[54:58] that God that God gave Abel you've seen
[55:01] what's taking place all you got to do
[55:03] the same thing and he wouldn't do
[55:05] it and brother BR says he said he said
[55:08] so you you say that you're in Jesus he
[55:11] said and then you deny the word he said
[55:14] something's wrong he said he says he
[55:18] always says Amen to his own word amen he
[55:21] said you know that right
[55:23] right so just like just like Cain when
[55:26] he had his own ideas of what was going
[55:28] to take place and what should take place
[55:30] and it should be like this and I don't
[55:31] understand why God don't want it to be
[55:34] the way he want that that you know that
[55:38] that horrible mess over there that's
[55:39] what God
[55:45] wants you mean I got to go get a lamb
[55:48] and drag it up
[55:51] here and then I got to take that rock
[55:54] and I got to you know because what
[55:55] happens is you know you you get all that
[55:58] blood all over
[56:00] you you get involved in that why because
[56:03] you become one with that lamb
[56:07] amen because you're up there and you you
[56:10] realize hey this lamb is taking my place
[56:13] that's right and you see the bleeding of
[56:15] that lamb and the blood that's flowing
[56:19] and you realize hey this Lamb's taking
[56:21] my
[56:22] place and you realize where you're at
[56:25] and see if you understand that and see
[56:28] that then it's like well but I don't I
[56:30] don't want to do that that that that's
[56:31] too hard that's too messy you
[56:34] know but you know you have to deny
[56:36] yourself amen right and do what God
[56:39] wants you to do see you if you want to
[56:41] come into fellowship with God then
[56:43] you've got to follow the way that God
[56:45] has it laid out for us see God God says
[56:49] you know if you understand if you gather
[56:52] with in the plan of God and he said you
[56:54] know the the things that you have to
[56:56] have have he said for
[56:58] fellowship and with god brother BR says
[57:01] you know there's joy there's Peace of
[57:03] Mind Faith he said longsuffering
[57:07] patience
[57:09] gentleness see if you go with in the
[57:12] faith of God that all these things come
[57:14] your
[57:15] way so if you if you he said what what
[57:17] kind of Faith he said he said the faith
[57:21] to fight the
[57:23] conflict he said not some kind of faith
[57:25] for some Theory or some reasoning or
[57:27] anything but it's faith in God's
[57:29] word it's the real word god coming he
[57:33] said he said because that you have to
[57:34] take it by the word amen yes and it's
[57:38] not just some kind of he said isn't it
[57:40] reasonable that the most you know most
[57:41] of the people come to this church isn't
[57:44] this the big
[57:46] church it's like well obviously you know
[57:48] because they have the more have more
[57:49] people obviously they have to be the
[57:53] truth you know because you know because
[57:55] we want to look at people want to look
[57:57] at it by their own sight right right
[58:01] well you
[58:02] know well that was all of that's in the
[58:04] Old Testament
[58:06] brother we're living in we're living in
[58:08] a realm of Grace you know it's all the
[58:11] whole Bible is nothing but Grace
[58:15] now and you and you tell me that if if
[58:18] God came because if if God comes and
[58:20] takes up residence in you according to
[58:22] the scripture that's what he does when
[58:24] he saves you he said I'll take up we
[58:26] will take up our Abode in you and if the
[58:29] spirit of God dwells in you then you
[58:31] tell me that the spirit of God lives
[58:33] like a carbage
[58:37] can then the that the that you know
[58:40] because you look at people and they well
[58:41] you know uh you know they just they just
[58:43] love the Lord and they you know they
[58:45] they just they're just so full of stuff
[58:47] and you know and the problem is is
[58:49] they're full so so full of
[58:54] devils and you know and yeah well you
[58:56] know I I just I just love the Lord until
[58:59] you until you well you know what the
[59:00] Lord wrote the Bible the spirit of the
[59:03] Lord moved upon those men all the way
[59:06] through the the Old Testament all the
[59:08] way down through time and the Lord was
[59:10] the one that spoke to them to write the
[59:13] scripture the the word was anointed you
[59:15] know they didn't come up with their own
[59:17] idea and write it in
[59:19] books it was it was it was the thoughts
[59:22] of God that was written in in in the
[59:25] languages
[59:27] and ju and just to say this you know
[59:29] people want to say well you know it's
[59:31] not written in the original because
[59:32] we're reading in the English and it's
[59:34] not written in in Arabic or Hebrew or
[59:37] whatever because it's you know because
[59:39] we we need to have we need to have the
[59:40] original and we all need to have you all
[59:43] be Scholars so we'll understand
[59:46] it and I was listening to brother Aaron
[59:48] McGary sometime back and and brother
[59:50] Aaron was talking about how uh the these
[59:53] group of Scholars got together and they
[59:55] were disc discussing the Lord's
[59:58] Prayer and they were discussing all the
[1:00:00] things that are written in the Lord's
[1:00:01] Prayer and all these great Scholars got
[1:00:03] together and you know the only two words
[1:00:05] in the whole prayer that they could
[1:00:07] agree on is our
[1:00:11] father they couldn't agree on anything
[1:00:13] else that's written
[1:00:16] there so what what does it take it takes
[1:00:19] it takes more than just human ideas and
[1:00:22] and scholarship and and great learning
[1:00:25] it takes the whole Holy
[1:00:27] Spirit Well if the if the holy spirit is
[1:00:29] the one that wrote the book If he if he
[1:00:32] give if he give men the ideas that came
[1:00:35] down and he showed them the visions and
[1:00:38] and they wrote down what God showed them
[1:00:40] and they took up and just like we see
[1:00:42] one giving giving this message and the
[1:00:44] other one picking up the exact same
[1:00:46] prophecy that came before just like
[1:00:49] Daniel going back and look what Jeremiah
[1:00:51] had to say and he picked up the exact
[1:00:53] same thought and continued on and God
[1:00:55] was showing him the exact same thing
[1:00:56] because it run in continuity because the
[1:00:59] word dovetails together then when it
[1:01:01] comes together and you see all of that
[1:01:03] then you know what if God done all of
[1:01:05] that and brought it all the way through
[1:01:08] then guess what if it changes from
[1:01:11] whatever language from Hebrew and Greek
[1:01:13] and it becomes to the Latin and
[1:01:15] everything else and when it got to the
[1:01:16] English then guess what it's the exact
[1:01:18] same meaning has the same power it has
[1:01:21] the same purpose it'll do the exact same
[1:01:23] thing that it did when God thought it
[1:01:26] and Isaiah wrote it down well it's the
[1:01:28] same power and it's it's the same it's
[1:01:31] just as alive as when God thought it and
[1:01:33] Moses spoke it and Moses wrote it down
[1:01:37] and it doesn't matter why because all I
[1:01:39] got to do is have faith in what God Said
[1:01:41] and you know what that I can see all
[1:01:43] because all of the Devils that have been
[1:01:45] defeated and all of the things that have
[1:01:47] taken place because what God has said in
[1:01:49] his word and we've seen it take place
[1:01:51] and that's what shows that this Bible's
[1:01:54] right
[1:01:57] am even when you take the things that
[1:01:59] that has taken place in science and and
[1:02:01] science breaks in and you see these
[1:02:03] things take place and you see these
[1:02:06] things and how the the scripture lines
[1:02:09] up ahead of time and and and they say
[1:02:11] well look science science figured this
[1:02:13] out science figured that out and all of
[1:02:16] a sudden you
[1:02:18] know
[1:02:20] Matthew uh Matthew Mor I believe is his
[1:02:22] name and uh he's he's known as the
[1:02:24] father of oceanography
[1:02:27] and I believe in the Scripture it says
[1:02:29] that he said that he will lead us in the
[1:02:31] paths of the
[1:02:32] Seas see either in Psalms or job there
[1:02:35] and he talks about that and you know
[1:02:36] this
[1:02:38] Matthew Fontaine Mari he uh was a uh
[1:02:43] United States naval officer and then he
[1:02:45] was a confederate naval officer and he
[1:02:48] was over the US Naval Observatory had
[1:02:51] ship logs thousands and thousands of
[1:02:53] ship logs new every path how long it
[1:02:57] took them to travel across the oceans
[1:02:59] and he sat in there one day and he said
[1:03:01] well he said if that's true he said then
[1:03:04] I can prove that there's paths in the
[1:03:08] sea and he sat down and he started
[1:03:10] marking every one of those ships and
[1:03:12] every position that they were in and how
[1:03:15] long it took them to cross the
[1:03:17] Seas and all and he started mapping all
[1:03:19] of the all of the weather conditions all
[1:03:21] these things he started writing down and
[1:03:23] this man wrote a book and he is known as
[1:03:26] the father of oceanography and even the
[1:03:28] books that are written today on o
[1:03:29] oceanography are still based on his
[1:03:32] works and he got and he got the
[1:03:34] inspiration to write that book because
[1:03:37] that's what the Bible says and even
[1:03:39] today when they look at photo um
[1:03:43] satellite photos and all that of the
[1:03:45] oceans and everything Matthew fonte
[1:03:47] Mor's work is still
[1:03:52] correct and what and here
[1:03:54] was thousands and thousands of years ago
[1:03:58] the inspiration hits somebody to write
[1:04:01] that and then it's 100,000 years later
[1:04:05] whenever it was then all of a sudden
[1:04:07] here's this man catches that
[1:04:09] inspiration and all of a sudden he's
[1:04:11] writing and and we have that information
[1:04:15] today and we're we're sending great big
[1:04:17] ships all around the world toight
[1:04:20] they're in the ocean going all around
[1:04:21] the world and it's based on what he done
[1:04:24] am
[1:04:26] but you know you you can't trust this
[1:04:32] Bible well that's that's just one thing
[1:04:34] that we've seen but you know how many
[1:04:35] other things have we seen about how God
[1:04:38] told them to prep the children of Israel
[1:04:40] prepare your food in different things
[1:04:42] all the things that's went you know how
[1:04:44] you how you uh sacrifice all the things
[1:04:46] that they went through and come to find
[1:04:49] out it's exactly the proper way of doing
[1:04:52] things amen just like just like
[1:04:55] circumcision is done on the eighth
[1:04:58] day well why why is it done well we know
[1:05:00] that's a type of Eternity but why is it
[1:05:02] done on the eighth
[1:05:04] day because when a son is born when a
[1:05:07] boy is born it takes eight days for the
[1:05:10] the vitamins and stuff in his body to
[1:05:11] build up so he wouldn't bleed to
[1:05:16] death so they were circumcised on the
[1:05:19] eighth day because you couldn't do it
[1:05:20] before then
[1:05:22] am but all of a sudden you know here God
[1:05:25] tells them on the e day and all of a
[1:05:26] sudden science finds out years and years
[1:05:28] later oh we understand that
[1:05:34] now but see it's it's all in the plan of
[1:05:37] God see God knows what he's doing why
[1:05:38] because he created all of it and he
[1:05:40] started all this and when he when he set
[1:05:42] everything in motion then he can tell
[1:05:43] people tell us how to how everything
[1:05:46] needs to
[1:05:48] go well then guess what he knew where
[1:05:50] you were going to be
[1:05:51] born he knew your he knew your who your
[1:05:54] parents were going to be he knew
[1:05:55] everything that you would do and
[1:05:56] everything that you'd
[1:06:00] face and he knew all your ups and downs
[1:06:03] and all your faults and
[1:06:05] failures and guess what God brought you
[1:06:07] to this
[1:06:10] place and you know he had Grace enough
[1:06:12] for you in every
[1:06:17] situation brother R says here he says he
[1:06:19] said if that church he said if Don't
[1:06:22] Preach every word of the Bible there and
[1:06:25] say Amen to every word believe every
[1:06:27] sign every wonder and see them what
[1:06:29] working right among them he said I'd get
[1:06:33] away from it no matter how big how
[1:06:35] little he said Faith love joy peace and
[1:06:38] faith in the word he said so let Satan
[1:06:41] set up his guns we've anchored amen we
[1:06:45] don't claim to be great people we're not
[1:06:47] great people in the side of the world
[1:06:49] we're humble people peasants we don't
[1:06:51] care for the world's
[1:06:53] riches but we've got what God has given
[1:06:56] us see if if we know what the word says
[1:06:59] then that's all we need and the Devil
[1:07:02] Comes against us the devil tries to
[1:07:04] attack us that's all right we're
[1:07:05] Anchored In Jesus we we've got we're
[1:07:08] fortified behind the word we know where
[1:07:10] we stand and if everything comes against
[1:07:12] us we don't have to worry about that
[1:07:14] because God will bring us through God
[1:07:16] will bring us to the place that God
[1:07:18] wants us to come
[1:07:23] to brother R speak speaking
[1:07:32] here and he
[1:07:34] was
[1:07:35] speaking about the about his ministry
[1:07:38] and everything and and all the things he
[1:07:41] says I'm a middle-aged man 53 years old
[1:07:44] and he said you know I love him more
[1:07:46] than I did back there because I've seen
[1:07:49] him in more trials and
[1:07:51] fights he said I've seen him when I come
[1:07:53] to the place where was so tempting when
[1:07:57] I said something like Noah and Arc this
[1:07:59] will
[1:08:00] be he said now watch oh mercy he said it
[1:08:03] will be stay there he said the Sun
[1:08:06] Passes on it will
[1:08:08] be he said why do you say that brother
[1:08:10] why do you know when you've been through
[1:08:13] all these things he said why do you know
[1:08:16] brother bradam that after all you've
[1:08:18] seen I got because he I'm 53 years old
[1:08:22] middle-aged man all the things I've seen
[1:08:24] he said I got confidence in God
[1:08:26] Amen all he said because I've seen him
[1:08:29] at all the trials and all the tests and
[1:08:33] he said and all the fights God's always
[1:08:34] been there yes sir he said how do you
[1:08:37] know that brother R he said because God
[1:08:39] said
[1:08:40] so he said it will be it has to be God
[1:08:44] said so he said I've anchored my soul in
[1:08:46] a Haven of Rest In Jesus I'm safe
[1:08:49] Evermore ever what comes or goes let's
[1:08:52] take it in that manner amen see we face
[1:08:55] all the things that we've seen take what
[1:08:58] God at his word all that's all you got
[1:09:01] to do is take God at his
[1:09:03] word you want to you want to walk in the
[1:09:06] in the in the in God's
[1:09:10] favor and all you all you've got to do

[1:09:26] if if if God has called us to this place

[1:09:30] this place then you know and and and I'm
[1:09:34] I'm guilty just like everybody else but
[1:09:36] you know if if God tells us to do
[1:09:39] something and we hear someone tell
[1:09:41] something just like just like brother

[1:11:54] if we if we want if we want to see the
[1:11:56] move of God if we want to see these
[1:11:57] things then you know what we need to
[1:11:58] find we need to find out what things are
[1:12:00] hindering us what's holding us back and
[1:12:02] are we hindering the whole
[1:12:08] church because you know I want to be
[1:12:10] here and you know
[1:12:13] and you know if if you don't want to be
[1:12:15] here that's fine but I'm telling you
[1:12:17] you're the one you're the one that's
[1:12:18] robbing yourself we rob ourselves when
[1:12:21] we don't do what God wants us to do what
[1:12:23] God's called us to do amen he lays he
[1:12:26] lays the blessings out there and it's up
[1:12:29] to you and I to take
[1:12:31] them and if we don't if we don't want
[1:12:33] that I I understand not everybody's able
[1:12:35] to do that and and you know I
[1:12:38] everybody's cases you know different
[1:12:40] cases or whatever I'm not I'm not
[1:12:42] getting into everybody's business I'm
[1:12:43] just saying you know the P the proofs in
[1:12:46] the pudding that's
[1:12:50] right because sometimes when when you
[1:12:52] come and there's only there's just a
[1:12:53] handful but you know what if if you
[1:12:56] don't if you if you
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:12:59] come if you don't come but I tell you
[1:13:02] what I've been blessed I don't know if
[1:13:03] anybody else has been blessed or not but
[1:13:05] you know because sometimes I come and
[1:13:07] I'm tired and the last place I want to
[1:13:09] be is that Bible
[1:13:11] study I'm just I'm just I'm just honest
[1:13:14] I'm human I sit back there sometimes and
[1:13:17] I fight
[1:13:18] sleep I'm tired it feels like I've run
[1:13:21] all day and the first time I sit in that
[1:13:23] chair and it's like
[1:13:25] he's like where's that at brother Aon
[1:13:28] brother way asked me a question I'm like
[1:13:30] I'm trying to flip my Rolodex you know
[1:13:32] it's like it's a little slow little SL I
[1:13:35] got to open my eyes
[1:13:37] first I'm
[1:13:45] praying uh well you know but you know I
[1:13:48] mean if if we if we if we want to see
[1:13:52] the move of
[1:13:54] God that sometimes we got to get out of
[1:13:56] our comfort zone we've got to move
[1:13:58] Beyond where we're
[1:14:02] at see I just want hear a few scriptures
[1:14:05] before I get done but you know you see
[1:14:08] these things
[1:14:12] and Proverbs 15:27 says he that is
[1:14:17] greedy of gain troubleth his own house
[1:14:19] but he that hateth gifts shall
[1:14:23] live it's like what does that
[1:14:25] mean and and if y'all don't if y'all
[1:14:28] don't mind me saying
[1:14:30] um I was listening to brother Aon McGary
[1:14:32] and um one time and brother Aaron was
[1:14:35] saying you know if you say he hateth
[1:14:36] gifts it's like well tell your wife well
[1:14:38] you can't you can't have nothing else
[1:14:39] because you you're supposed to hate
[1:14:41] gifts you know you know well you
[1:14:44] shouldn't want that because if you hate
[1:14:46] gifts you know and that we should do
[1:14:47] away with Christmas and everything
[1:14:48] because we're eating gifts but no the
[1:14:51] the problem is is is we're trying to get
[1:14:53] something we're trying to to gain
[1:14:56] something and he said he said the
[1:14:59] problem is is we get greedy for things
[1:15:01] he said he said a man that's greedy of
[1:15:03] gain so there's a there's an improper
[1:15:06] it's it's not it's not wrong to have
[1:15:09] gain it's it's not but the problem is is
[1:15:12] if you what does the word greedy
[1:15:16] mean you're trying to get something by
[1:15:20] the wrong manner or you're trying to get
[1:15:22] something that don't belong to you right
[1:15:25] so if you're trying to get something the
[1:15:26] wrong way he said then you're troubling
[1:15:28] your own
[1:15:31] house well you know what if we don't if
[1:15:34] we don't live the right kind of lives
[1:15:35] then you know what nobody in your
[1:15:37] household's going to be to the place
[1:15:39] where they need to be if if fathers
[1:15:42] don't do the right thing if they don't
[1:15:44] live the example if they don't try to
[1:15:47] help if if the fathers don't try to
[1:15:50] bring this then you know what they're a
[1:15:51] trouble to their own H their
[1:15:53] house and you know what it takes strong
[1:15:56] Christians to build strong families to
[1:15:58] build strong homes and strong families
[1:16:00] will build a strong
[1:16:04] church and so what did the scripture say
[1:16:07] that you know how can a man rule his you
[1:16:09] know rule the church how can you how can
[1:16:10] you be a benefit to the church how can
[1:16:12] you help in the church how can you edify
[1:16:14] the church if you can't rule your own
[1:16:16] house if you can't be if you can't roll
[1:16:19] your own family if you can't be a help
[1:16:21] to them how you going to help in the
[1:16:22] Church of God
[1:16:26] and so it takes these things you know so
[1:16:29] you not it's not wrong to have these
[1:16:33] things but if we try to do it the wrong
[1:16:36] way
[1:16:38] see it's not wrong to have these things
[1:16:41] but if you're going after things that
[1:16:43] that's not going to be edifying to you
[1:16:45] it's not going to benefit you he said
[1:16:48] the person that doesn't are not trying
[1:16:49] to get after those
[1:16:51] things and see lots of times we want to
[1:16:54] we want to get into things and try to
[1:16:57] get things but the problem is is they're
[1:16:59] not what God wants us to have or it's
[1:17:01] not the right time for God for us to
[1:17:03] have those
[1:17:04] things but if we look and trust God that
[1:17:08] God will bring us to the place where he
[1:17:10] where we need to come to
[1:17:13] right Proverbs
[1:17:15] 13 13 through 15 it says who so
[1:17:18] despiseth the word shall be destroyed
[1:17:20] but he that fearth the Commandment shall
[1:17:22] be rewarded he said the law of the wise
[1:17:25] is a Fountain of Life to depart from the
[1:17:28] snares of death good understanding
[1:17:31] giveth favor but the way of
[1:17:33] transgressors is
[1:17:36] hard see you have the ability and God
[1:17:39] has laid this out before you that you
[1:17:42] have this and you know so many times
[1:17:44] brother Brown talks about the way of the
[1:17:46] transgressor is
[1:17:48] hard you know if he had have done what
[1:17:51] God wanted him to do in the beginning if
[1:17:53] he had have followed
[1:17:55] you know he went through all that you
[1:17:57] know Sister Hope's dying there and he
[1:17:59] went up there and he was standing there
[1:18:00] and you know and S the LA you know one
[1:18:02] of the last words she told Brother
[1:18:04] brandom she's sitting there you know
[1:18:06] where we made our
[1:18:07] mistake said we listen to
[1:18:11] Mama so we should have went God called
[1:18:14] us and we shouldn't have worried what
[1:18:16] everybody else had to
[1:18:19] say and all the things that he went
[1:18:23] through when he listen when he went
[1:18:25] overseas and he was listening to those
[1:18:27] men and they wanted him to go a certain
[1:18:29] way and God kept telling him know you
[1:18:30] need to go to those
[1:18:33] natives God's not blessing this trip
[1:18:36] because you're listening to those
[1:18:39] men you know he was in he was in there
[1:18:41] and he thought he was going to die and
[1:18:42] Dr Adair came to him had all those
[1:18:44] amibas and he's like it shot Dr adir
[1:18:49] that he was still alive after going
[1:18:51] through all of
[1:18:52] that and he was in there pray
[1:18:57] and the Lord finally come and delivered
[1:18:58] him from
[1:19:01] that see you come through all see the
[1:19:03] law of the wise is a Fountain of Life to
[1:19:06] depart from the snares of death
[1:19:09] see thank God we had a prophet that came
[1:19:12] and told us these things you know the
[1:19:13] scripture has been written for our
[1:19:15] example how many times have you had
[1:19:17] people come up and give their testimony
[1:19:19] and tell you listen this this is what
[1:19:22] I've been through this is what God
[1:19:25] and it's a warning to us amen it speaks
[1:19:28] to us like then God has given us a
[1:19:31] warning he's showing us the way that we
[1:19:32] should go to miss these
[1:19:35] snares amen let's have the the musicians
[1:19:38] come let's all stand and so here I want
[1:19:43] to finish with this
[1:19:45] quote brother Brown
[1:19:50] says this is from the testimony on the
[1:19:53] sea said now listen I want to talk to
[1:19:55] you while while they're coming he said
[1:19:58] have faith you come up
[1:20:01] here he that will confess me before me
[1:20:04] him will I confess before my father now
[1:20:06] you
[1:20:07] confess where you're dilatory how
[1:20:11] dilatory how you've neglected God you
[1:20:14] confess that as wrong and say that I'm
[1:20:17] sorry God that I did that he said find
[1:20:20] favor with him then watch what he will
[1:20:22] do for you you just conf confess that
[1:20:25] you're wrong and he will take care of
[1:20:27] the rest of
[1:20:30] it it's it's amazing what we have to do
[1:20:35] we can just confess our
[1:20:37] wrongs you know if we confess our sins
[1:20:40] he said he he's faithful and just to
[1:20:43] forgive
[1:20:44] us and cleanse us from all
[1:20:47] unrighteousness so Lord I I want you to
[1:20:49] search me and find if there's anything

[1:22:12] right with you I want to be I want to
[1:22:14] be clean Lord
[1:22:18] Jesus father I
[1:22:25] Lord I think about the day David in the
[1:22:29] Psalms Lord where he was writing and he
[1:22:31] was talking about being surrounded and
[1:22:36] compassed Lord when when Saul was
[1:22:38] chasing him and all the things that was
[1:22:40] taking place and he was being surrounded
[1:22:42] and all the things Lord and all the
[1:22:44] stress of Life
[1:22:48] Lord Lord he said that you came in the
[1:22:51] midst of all that and you began to
[1:22:53] deliver him he said because you
[1:22:55] delighted in
[1:22:56] me Lord because he he walked upright
[1:22:59] before you Lord Jesus because he had
[1:23:02] Clean Hands Lord because he had a Clean
[1:23:03] Heart Lord that he walked before you
[1:23:06] Lord when he when he had the opportunity
[1:23:07] to slay
[1:23:09] Saul and he stood there and he said God
[1:23:11] forbid that I touch God's
[1:23:14] anointed Lord because he walked in the
[1:23:16] Integrity of his heart Lord Jesus that
[1:23:18] you delivered him from those things and
[1:23:21] he could stand up and praise you for
[1:23:23] what he's seen you do

[1:23:42] Lord and and walk the way that you'd
[1:23:44] have us walk Lord that doesn't Deliver
[1:23:46] Us from and problems and trials and
[1:23:49] everything Lord but we realize that that
[1:23:51] brings us to a place that you will
[1:23:53] Deliver Us Lord Lord that you'll bring
[1:23:55] us out Lord Jesus Lord if we can just
[1:23:57] walk the way that you'd have us walk
[1:23:59] Lord Jesus Lord we we know that we have
[1:24:02] to be Overcomers Lord and so that brings
[1:24:05] trials and that brings problems Lord

[1:24:16] are the truth the way the light Lord
[1:24:18] Jesus and we if we just walk that way we
[1:24:21] can have the Deliverance that we need
