[31:14] trouble well straighten that they sent
[31:18] us word tell us the word
[31:20] back pray
[31:28] what I was thinking about was you know I
[31:31] bet they wonder what kind of a church we
[31:33] are they probably think we're about
[31:35] 50,000 spread over 10 acre field you
[31:40] know and uh you know kind of a worldwide
[31:44] system going that's using up bandwidth
[31:47] that you know they're having to give us
[31:49] extra to be able to uh to do it and I
[31:53] bet you the people think Bo they're
[31:54] doing and some of them on the Internet
[31:56] unless they go live they probably think
[31:57] but then they click on live and all Lord
[32:00] just look around and see there's about a
[32:02] hundred of us but we do have a good time
[32:06] in the Lord and really love our children
[32:08] and them to be part of it and everything
[32:10] else and anybody else want to fellowship
[32:12] with us by way of internets and things
[32:14] that's good just you just open up and do
[32:16] what you want to and have a good time
[32:18] Brother Gary said he was down at his

[32:23] said you know he just sitting there
[32:24] playing uh the banjo with everybody
[32:27] playing here so just have a good time
[32:29] out there we're having a good time here

[33:07] fellowshipping together cuz it won't be
[33:09] any Sunday afternoon service on the 30th
[33:12] it just be the morning service so we
[33:14] have to make those records you know
[33:16] people wonder why we do it and they're
[33:19] they're changing things a little bit and
[33:20] putting some of the old Services now on
[33:22] the on the ability to put on the
[33:24] internet and I don't know why in the
[33:26] world that they chose to do that but
[33:28] they wanted to do it and they wanted to
[33:29] put serieses in and things like that
[33:31] well Richard's having to go through and
[33:33] because but sometimes we we didn't know
[33:36] who was what you know so brother Ray's
[33:38] running the takes and getting them ready
[33:40] and brother Richard's having to to go
[33:41] through and and always write little
[33:43] notes if you seen my thing I have little
[33:45] notes up here and even if I say well
[33:47] okay I want the deacons to say something
[33:48] about the kid behav I'll write a little
[33:50] note here well that's you know it keep
[33:53] up a richer be life because see
[33:55] sometimes I I'll be in the services and
[33:57] I'll I'll I'll just go over one page
[34:00] well then you got to go back up to the
[34:01] top of the next page somewhere to find
[34:03] that next sermon cuz if you don't you're
[34:04] going to go from 12 14 you know or
[34:07] something like that and you're going to
[34:08] be left out but you know we we try to
[34:11] make a little record that's why I keep
[34:12] announcing what I'm saying I keep
[34:14] announcing things to where that they're
[34:16] repetitive and and to that we can keep
[34:18] up with it okay so we're going to turn
[34:20] to Luke
[34:23] 21 and just read a few verses and try to
[34:25] continue our thought that that we had
[34:28] for this morning and we will start with
[34:31] verse 29 through 36 let's pray father we
[34:35] thank you we love you we thank you for
[34:38] your grace and your love thank you for
[34:40] the day that we live truly we thank you
[34:42] for the children that you would put
[34:45] within their hearts that they would sing
[34:46] about you and that they would talk about
[34:49] you and they would say it's the Bible
[34:51] and Lord we just thank you we love you
[34:54] and we commit everything to you Lord
[34:56] that you may have your way with each one
[34:59] of us so you come on the scene and
[35:01] manifest yourself now and let your love
[35:04] abide with each and every one of us you
[35:05] said you sent your word and healed us
[35:07] delivered from destruction so we believe
[35:09] that we' seen you in Mighty ways but we
[35:12] look forward every day to see you again
[35:14] cuz that's why we gather together with
[35:16] brothers and sisters of like Precious
[35:18] faith is to serve our living God who's
[35:21] living among us thank you for all things
[35:24] Lord have your way with each one forgive
[35:26] our sins cleanse us from all
[35:28] unrighteousness and keep us in Jesus
[35:30] name
[35:32] amen we go to
[35:35] Luke
[35:38] 27 I had this wrong for Joe and we had
[35:40] to get it straight I had him on 21 27
[35:44] verse
[35:45] 29 and he spake to them a parable Behold
[35:49] a fig tree and all the trees when they
[35:52] now shoot forth and you see and know
[35:54] your own selves that summer is now nigh
[35:57] at hand so
[36:00] likewise listen you when you see these
[36:03] things come to pass know ye that the
[36:06] kingdom of God is now at hand just as
[36:10] well as the weather conditions the
[36:12] kingdom of God is at hand when you see
[36:14] these things coming to pass right verily
[36:17] I say unto you this generation shall not
[36:20] pass till all be fulfill Heaven and
[36:23] Earth shall pass away but my word shall
[36:25] not pass away that's right take heed to
[36:28] yourself lest at any times your hearts
[36:30] be overcharged with spiiting and
[36:33] drunkenness and cares of this life and
[36:35] so that so that they come on you
[36:38] unawares for as a snare shall it come on
[36:42] all them that dwell on the face of the
[36:45] whole earth watch ye therefore and pray
[36:47] always that ye may be accounted worthy
[36:50] to escape all these things that shall
[36:53] come to pass and stand before the son of
[36:57] to stand before the son of man that's
[36:59] right am you may be seated the Lord add
[37:00] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[37:04] now we were talking this morning of that
[37:07] these things must come to
[37:09] pass and now this afternoon what we want
[37:12] to do is kind of talk
[37:15] about the things that we
[37:19] miss and it all comes
[37:22] from the point of what we've been
[37:24] talking about of you know heaven and
[37:29] seeing those
[37:31] things and maybe you don't think about
[37:34] it as we do as ministers or something to
[37:39] to uh talk about these
[37:43] things that mean so much to
[37:46] us but you know there's a lot of
[37:50] things that is in the Book of
[37:53] Revelations now the bride goes up in
[37:55] Revelations 4:1
[37:57] and is not seen until Revelations 19:21
[38:01] that's right now we didn't give the
[38:03] quotes but we'd be glad to find them for
[38:05] you especially there's one on like Feast
[38:08] of the trumpets where brother ROM I
[38:10] believe that's the one where he said is
[38:11] thus sayith the Lord you know but he
[38:14] shows that the bride goes up in
[38:15] Revelations 4:1 and not seen until 1921
[38:19] when you're coming back into the
[38:20] millennial Reign right all right so then
[38:23] we're going to miss all of the things
[38:26] except we're not going to miss the fifth
[38:28] chapter because the fifth chapter is up
[38:30] in heaven right and the prophet said
[38:32] that is the bride in heaven you know and
[38:34] we're priest and kings and things so we
[38:37] won't miss
[38:38] that you know part of it amen but we'll
[38:41] miss all of the wrong things and it it's
[38:46] it's easy sometime to talk about the
[38:48] things that are going to take place but
[38:51] then you have to be able to put things
[38:53] in a category to be able to see things
[38:57] maybe that we'll miss right you know
[38:59] because we don't want to we we want to
[39:01] keep it in the right order but as I said
[39:04] now the bride goes up Revelations 4:1
[39:06] because that's where John is taken up
[39:09] and she misses those other things that
[39:12] are to take place and people will say
[39:14] and I've had them to question me on that
[39:16] point they said but what about
[39:17] Revelations
[39:19] 10:7 you know well what about
[39:22] it don't you believe that this message
[39:26] now not brother now but don't you
[39:28] believe that this message will go to
[39:29] Israel amen amen sure this is the
[39:32] message of redemption right this message
[39:34] will go to Israel well all right that's
[39:36] Revelation
[39:38] 10 see 1 through 7 as much as it is
[39:42] anything else it doesn't put brother
[39:44] brandom in Revelations
[39:46] 10 like we put him there right cuz if we
[39:50] go up in Revelations you know
[39:53] 41 and we miss these things that will
[39:55] transpire upon Earth after the
[39:58] then surely we ought to be able to to
[40:01] understand that uh there's a lot of
[40:05] those things we miss right amen they
[40:07] don't pertain to us you said what the
[40:09] seals brother the seals are to Israel
[40:12] right they said to brother around said
[40:15] will Thessalonians there about the man
[40:17] of sin sitting in the temple of God
[40:18] showing himself to be as God said will
[40:20] that fulfill the first seal he said
[40:22] yes right see the seal is actually to
[40:26] Israel the
[40:29] Revelation is to the bride now we're
[40:32] going to get to it in a minute because
[40:33] we're going to divide between it there's
[40:36] a difference the prophet said and the
[40:38] between the church and the bride right
[40:42] all right now he says there's a
[40:44] difference between so we're going to
[40:46] divide it a little bit when we get over
[40:47] to the point but I want you to think
[40:49] about it
[40:51] see that the things between Revelations
[40:55] 4:1 and 1921 one other than us being up
[40:58] in heaven in chapter
[41:00] 5 that will be to Israel and the things
[41:04] transpiring right but I keep saying it
[41:07] over and over to you see you say but but
[41:10] but brother Dale that's just it's not in
[41:12] the right order brother R said it
[41:14] was right amen he said everything was in
[41:16] order right amen all right so if we look
[41:20] at it correctly and understand then as
[41:22] the bride goes up in the
[41:24] Rapture right and all these other things
[41:26] that we thought we were going to have to
[41:28] have and
[41:29] do you know will be to Israel and then
[41:34] we come back in Millennial right and
[41:37] that's that's that's a wonderful thing
[41:40] you know we miss a lot of bad parts
[41:42] right so what we miss is what we're
[41:44] talking about this evening right but the
[41:46] reason we miss it is because of who we
[41:48] are amen now here's the whole nutshell
[41:53] of what I'm saying see then we were
[41:54] looking up in heaven and seeing these
[41:56] things go across right and we seen the
[41:59] the uh the future home even we seen the
[42:01] Millennium we seen the future home we'
[42:04] seen the things that would be there we
[42:06] saw the uh we didn't cover them as much
[42:08] in detail but we saw the white
[42:11] throne but we seen that we would not be
[42:14] standing before the white
[42:16] Throne you know that we would be sitting
[42:18] on the throne with him amen well you
[42:21] know what that means we miss going to
[42:23] the white drone right right so that's
[42:25] kind of the idea of what I'm talking
[42:26] about
[42:28] so we can look at it and say well look
[42:29] at this look at this morning star
[42:31] singing together sons of God shout it
[42:33] for Joy well you know what that's
[42:35] somebody right right why can't we
[42:38] believe it's us right all right and if
[42:41] we believe it's us you know what we miss
[42:44] all of those things right amen cuz he's
[42:46] already showing
[42:49] us you remember when uh let's
[42:52] see when God came to Abraham
[42:57] he said can I withhold
[42:59] anything from
[43:01] Abraham seeing that he's the heir right
[43:06] so you know what he told him the future
[43:08] y about Israel told him the things that
[43:11] would happen
[43:13] right to
[43:15] Abraham all
[43:17] right so then if he thought that much
[43:20] about that what about you and I right
[43:23] amen now we're going to get down in a
[43:25] minute and and we'll drop down into
[43:26] something something and and all but
[43:28] we're going to be talking about that the
[43:30] bride misses the tribulation because you
[43:32] know she cannot go through the
[43:33] tribulation right and all but we're
[43:36] going to pick up some scriptures that I
[43:38] had seen what the prophet I believe what
[43:41] he was saying about it but it really
[43:43] just begin to unfold a little to where
[43:45] that we could to understand so we'll get
[43:47] to that in a minute but what I want you
[43:49] to think about now if we go up in
[43:50] Revelations
[43:53] 4:1 see that's why it says in
[43:55] Revelations 101 one or 10 10 107 but in
[44:00] the days of the voice of the seventh
[44:02] angel that's right when he begins to
[44:05] sound see that doesn't put brother
[44:08] random there right neither no more than
[44:10] it puts us
[44:12] there right I've had discussions with
[44:15] ministers about that even though that
[44:17] they'll read what brother random says
[44:19] and it's thus sayth the Lord we go up
[44:20] Revelation 4 but they still say but we
[44:23] got what about that what about you know
[44:28] remember if you're going to put
[44:30] Revelations 10 anything why don't you do
[44:33] what brother Bram
[44:34] done why don't you put it where he said
[44:36] at Revelations 10:1 is the same as
[44:40] Revelations 1113
[44:43] right that's right which shows the Bride
[44:46] of Jesus
[44:47] Christ but that don't put us
[44:51] there we don't have to go through the
[44:53] tribulation to be able to understand
[44:56] amen do you get it amen amen we get the
[45:00] Revelation amen we get the revelation of
[45:03] what will transpire from here all the
[45:05] way through even till brother randam I I
[45:08] I wrote it down I got it written in the
[45:09] Bible somewhere there but he says he
[45:12] gave an order he said the next is the
[45:14] rapture right he said then the
[45:17] tribulation sits on
[45:18] Israel he said and then there'll be an
[45:22] Armageddon he said then the Millennium
[45:24] will come and he said then after the
[45:27] Millennium said there'll be a little
[45:29] season and he said then there'll be a
[45:31] white Throne judgment and he said then
[45:34] there'll be the future home right well
[45:36] you know what I I love to just sit down
[45:39] and read that one after the other you
[45:40] know right but you know what people are
[45:43] so uh spiritually minded and I'm not
[45:46] throwing no Stones I'm just saying
[45:49] words but brother Rand will be talking
[45:52] and he said if I don't see you anymore
[45:54] I'll see you in the Millennium but next
[45:57] thing is the Millennium look at that
[45:58] look at that look at that next thing is
[45:59] the
[46:01] Millennium he didn't say
[46:04] that but that's what people think you
[46:07] they just change anything to fit
[46:09] anything they want
[46:10] to and that won't work so we go up
[46:13] Revelation 4:1 we miss those
[46:16] things but we get to revelation of what
[46:19] all of that is about that's it amen we
[46:21] know now what Israel will do the two
[46:26] witnesses will come
[46:27] how that that'll take place 144,000 will
[46:30] be called all of those things have
[46:32] already been given to the bride by
[46:35] Revelation right well why can't we
[46:37] believe it that way and see by that then
[46:39] we miss a lot of
[46:43] things we miss a lot of things that we
[46:45] used to think that we're going to get
[46:47] you
[46:48] know all right and see by doing that
[46:53] it's a fulfilling of the
[46:54] scriptures right that must come to pass
[46:58] and it was back there we read it again
[47:00] it shall come to pass when we use must
[47:02] come to pass in the morning and in Luke
[47:04] we read where it must come to or shall
[47:06] come to
[47:07] pass these
[47:10] things thank God that we missed that
[47:13] that that day won't come on us that
[47:16] we'll Escape these
[47:18] things and miss those horrible
[47:21] situations that will come upon the Earth
[47:24] amen you can say well I understand
[47:27] understand we're not going through the
[47:27] tribulation do you really understand it
[47:32] right where is your
[47:36] scripture you know because we taught and
[47:39] basically the whole world system teaches
[47:42] I'm doing religious
[47:45] system teaches that the bride will go
[47:48] through the tribulation
[47:49] right and in the Baptist you got what's
[47:52] called in the Presbyterian I guess and
[47:54] all them got the same but they got a
[47:57] seven-year tribulation they got a 3 and
[47:59] 1/2 years of minor they call it 3 and
[48:01] 1/2 years of
[48:03] major cuz they they didn't want to put
[48:05] us through all of it so bad you know so
[48:07] they came up with a doctrine of
[48:09] seven-year
[48:10] tribulation three and a half minor have
[48:13] major we're here through the minor but
[48:16] not the major amen all right so that's
[48:18] what they you know that's their Doctrine
[48:20] and ideas but now listen see some of the
[48:23] people in this message think that's what
[48:24] brother R was teaching
[48:26] but it was
[48:27] not right he only taught three and a
[48:30] half years tribulation that's right
[48:32] there's only three and a half years for
[48:33] the ministry of Christ CU three and 1/2
[48:35] years we already back dying all right
[48:37] now but see we to bring it down to
[48:40] seeing
[48:41] it by being in the
[48:44] bride we
[48:46] miss these things that are going to come
[48:48] upon the Earth right to try them right
[48:53] the people that's
[48:54] left all right now watch we get to in a
[48:57] minute you'll see it see by being in the
[49:00] bride of Christ we don't have to go
[49:02] through the tribulation
[49:05] right as I said now most of the
[49:07] religious
[49:08] World believes that we do right Y and
[49:13] some who follow around this message one
[49:16] that had a tent right over here back
[49:18] good many years ago that travels about
[49:20] the country you know he kind of rides a
[49:25] message he believed that we was going to
[49:27] go through the tribulation man down here
[49:30] around Monroe you know these are people
[49:33] are supposed to be in the
[49:34] message or at least around it he
[49:37] believed we've going through he even had
[49:39] the the campgrounds made perfectly far
[49:41] that right some of you know about it
[49:44] some Of You' been there seen but see I'm
[49:46] just doing that not thr own but just to
[49:48] sh you that even people of this message
[49:50] still what they believe right because
[49:53] it's such an old Doctrine
[49:57] you know because it's come all the way
[49:58] down
[50:01] through till you know it it makes it
[50:04] hard to understand the scripture
[50:06] sometimes because of the way that people
[50:08] do all right now we'll read in a minute
[50:10] what the prophet has to say about it but
[50:12] what I want you to see is because if
[50:14] we're part of
[50:16] him you
[50:18] know if you're born
[50:20] again that makes you a child of God y
[50:23] right now we can make carnal excuse me
[50:27] we can make
[50:28] statements that sometimes shows our
[50:31] carnality and uh you know doing things
[50:35] but I like to look at the prophet's
[50:38] message and I like to look at the
[50:42] Bible because I believe that they're
[50:44] saying the same cuz that's where the
[50:46] prophet got it from was the Bible That's
[50:48] Right amen you know and so then what he
[50:52] says has got to be in the Bible or he
[50:55] wasn't a Bible prophet
[50:57] that's right now by doing that
[51:00] then we can
[51:02] quote I mean most people say well well
[51:05] we know that we don't and this quotes
[51:07] it's it's
[51:08] right see Noah wrote over in the ark
[51:13] right that's the
[51:16] tribulation all right but Enoch went up
[51:18] in the
[51:19] Rapture all right those are types and
[51:23] things and those are things that brother
[51:25] random gave that shows the scripture
[51:28] shows that we don't have to go through
[51:29] the
[51:30] tribulation we miss all of these things
[51:33] by being a part of the bride of
[51:35] Christ because listen church not only do
[51:39] we miss these
[51:41] things it's already been revealed to us
[51:44] by the
[51:46] Bible where we're
[51:50] at we're already as far as we do
[51:53] spiritual or think spiritually we
[51:56] resurrect sitting in Heavenly places in
[51:58] Christ
[51:59] Jesus right all right then as far as
[52:02] spiritually speaking by the baptism of
[52:05] the Holy Ghost in your soul your soul is
[52:07] already in eternity right right by the
[52:10] new birth so that means your soul is
[52:13] already in the Eighth Day by the new
[52:14] birth
[52:16] right all right now the Millennium will
[52:18] be the seventh day right and then the
[52:22] eighth day will be the future home amen
[52:24] or
[52:25] eternity well God's already showed us
[52:29] there cuz he showed a
[52:32] city right right he showed a city coming
[52:35] down right and John is so enthused by
[52:39] looking at the city until when he
[52:42] described it he described it as the
[52:44] bride he's so enthus looking at the
[52:47] bride when he's describing her he's
[52:49] describing the
[52:51] city
[52:52] right come on read Revelation 21:22 when
[52:56] you get
[52:57] time he will be so Inus of describing it
[53:01] until he puts them together and that is
[53:04] together because the city is made
[53:06] according to our desires right right all
[53:10] right the future home as we talk about
[53:12] right so
[53:14] then you can't
[53:18] separate us from that so we're already
[53:21] revealed as being
[53:23] there that's what God thinks about us
[53:26] now we're still
[53:28] here now here's the point I've been
[53:30] trying to get us to do and for all these
[53:32] years for many years talking about
[53:34] matching
[53:36] pieces if we could ever get oursel to
[53:38] the place that we can see ourselves
[53:40] there that's right that's
[53:43] amen then when we see ourselves there
[53:46] it'll just be a matter of him stepping
[53:47] us across amen but that's our
[53:51] problem we're so Earthbound until we're
[53:54] not any good spiritually a lot of time
[53:57] but a lot of people then go off on all
[53:59] these tantrums of doctrines and they're
[54:01] so spiritual minded that they ain't no
[54:03] earthly
[54:05] good you right I I'd rather have a
[54:09] little bit of each one and let it
[54:11] balance out to see what the truth
[54:13] is all right so now we miss the
[54:18] tribulation but now you might not have
[54:20] thought about it like
[54:21] this why is it you miss
[54:24] it he said well because we're this we're
[54:27] that we're the bride of Christ right but
[54:29] put it in the
[54:30] scriptures right and and give the
[54:33] scriptures like the prophet would with
[54:35] Noah going across
[54:38] see riding over through the
[54:41] tribulation Enoch going off in a Rapture
[54:45] before that transpired what's he doing
[54:47] he's tying the Bible
[54:49] together to show us how perfect God sees
[54:54] us now why are we going to miss this
[54:57] Brother Gary why are we going to miss
[54:59] these
[55:01] things and we we hear the prophet and we
[55:04] we but we do we pay that much
[55:06] attention he said
[55:10] no why would you said would you make
[55:14] your wife go through a trial or a test
[55:17] yeah before you married
[55:21] her to see whether she's a good wife or
[55:24] not now that'd be something wouldn't
[55:27] it he said well we got a couple coming
[55:30] up here you
[55:31] know and we tell Mary and I can't never
[55:35] remember his name Michael M Mah but we
[55:40] tell Mary and
[55:42] Mah when they talk about getting M
[55:45] okay so now what's going to have to
[55:47] happen
[55:48] is you're going to have to go through
[55:50] all these test Mary to prove that you're
[55:52] a good
[55:54] wife that's right amen so you got 6
[55:57] months of this and 6 months of this and
[56:00] 6 months of this and maybe about two or
[56:03] 3 years from now that's right he decided
[56:06] he wanted to marry you amen now would
[56:09] that be something
[56:11] amen that's right that'd be a horrible
[56:14] thing we don't think about what a
[56:16] prophet would be
[56:18] saved we think it is just a a
[56:22] statement but you know what he's doing
[56:26] that Prophet to me now when he makes
[56:28] those type of
[56:31] statements he's taken the entire
[56:35] Bible as a background to
[56:38] show what God
[56:40] thinks of his little
[56:43] bride amen you know the entire
[56:47] Bible is being brought forth in the
[56:50] Bible we read of things that are not
[56:53] that maybe were not too
[56:54] good Paul said it such were some of you
[56:58] right but now you're clean amen that's
[57:01] right cuz that's what God has
[57:04] done that's right but see we don't have
[57:07] to go through the
[57:09] tribulation all right now let's get some
[57:12] quotes from ROM and then we'll we'll get
[57:14] down and and pick up something he said
[57:16] so go ahead brother Jo
[57:18] let's let's look at a few
[57:20] quotes I know you think about these and
[57:23] and you say well now we just we we we've
[57:25] known long time we missed the
[57:27] tribulation but do you know
[57:30] why right if you don't get nothing out
[57:32] of it just
[57:33] remember if we are the Bride of Jesus
[57:39] Christ if you have the new birth
[57:42] today your soul is already
[57:46] Eternal and God cannot lose
[57:52] you because you're his wife
[57:56] and how beautiful he thinks about you
[57:59] and the Book of Revelations was
[58:01] written to show
[58:03] us you remember back how long's it been
[58:06] a year or so ago when I made this
[58:08] statement I said you don't find Jesus in
[58:11] The Book of Revelations by
[58:14] himself he's either with his bride or
[58:17] he's in Bride form or he's with the
[58:19] children of
[58:21] Israel you know in the Redemption form
[58:24] for them he's never shown by itself
[58:27] in the Book of
[58:29] Revelation that meant something to me
[58:31] when the Lord showed me that because I
[58:34] could see what he thought of you and
[58:36] I and that he would tell us the end of
[58:39] the story before the story ever
[58:42] started right amen if the Bible was
[58:45] written before the foundation of the
[58:47] world right then the Book of Revelation
[58:49] was written before the foundation of the
[58:52] world he shows us what he thinks about
[58:55] us M right and because of what he thinks
[58:58] about us we're going to miss a lot of
[59:01] the things that are to come upon the
[59:04] Earth right so let's see what he had to
[59:07] say about it four seal paragraph 107 63
[59:13] 321 how can anybody get to church
[59:16] through the
[59:17] tribulation don't know but what's it got
[59:19] to go through the tribulation far now
[59:22] watch his wording Church bride Church
[59:24] bride a minute what's it got go through
[59:26] the tribulation
[59:27] far and it hasn't got got hasn't got a
[59:33] sin okay I mean the I don't mean the
[59:37] church the church will go through the
[59:39] tribulation but I'm talking about the
[59:42] bride the bride won't know it hasn't got
[59:45] a sin against it at all it's done been
[59:49] bleached out and there's not even a
[59:51] there's not
[59:53] even smell of it there's nothing left
[59:58] they're perfect before God so what's any
[1:00:00] tribulation to purify them MH but the
[1:00:03] others do the church does go through the
[1:00:06] tribulation but not the
[1:00:09] bride amen we miss the tribulation
[1:00:13] because being part of God being in his
[1:00:17] bride all right right so the things that
[1:00:21] would be in the Bible that would talk
[1:00:22] about the horrible days that are coming
[1:00:25] upon us when the the the things will
[1:00:27] happen to all we think it's bad out here
[1:00:30] now we think it's horrible now but what
[1:00:33] about when the wrath of God is poured
[1:00:34] out because that's the
[1:00:36] tribulation this is not the wrath of God
[1:00:39] right this is just Satan and his leading
[1:00:41] up to that but what about the wrath of
[1:00:43] God that is poured out upon man until
[1:00:46] they leaveing the Bible says they pray
[1:00:48] to
[1:00:49] die that's right they'll try to hide in
[1:00:51] the
[1:00:52] Rocks the dens to get away from it face
[1:00:58] right well because they realize they
[1:01:00] missed it
[1:01:02] right but see you and I are going to be
[1:01:04] in Rapture Jesus we don't have to go
[1:01:07] through that amen that's the point I'm
[1:01:09] want you to look at but get get this now
[1:01:12] what I want you to
[1:01:14] see the Book of Revelations
[1:01:17] 2122 shows us already
[1:01:21] die the prophet of God would say it and
[1:01:24] look the basics of the old religious
[1:01:26] World system as we talking about believe
[1:01:28] you're going through the tribulation
[1:01:30] you're com to a little eighth grade
[1:01:31] education man or seventh and he said
[1:01:34] give me one
[1:01:38] scripture that shows the bride will have
[1:01:42] to go through the
[1:01:44] tribulation now bud they been they I
[1:01:47] mean you're talking about one man
[1:01:48] against the whole religious system
[1:01:50] that's
[1:01:51] right back in the days where brother Ram
[1:01:53] was I remember the the B alone had about
[1:01:56] 500
[1:01:59] million what about all of the millions
[1:02:02] of millions of religious
[1:02:06] people and one man standing against it
[1:02:09] to say show me one
[1:02:13] scripture what don't you think that left
[1:02:15] have done it
[1:02:16] right but you couldn't do
[1:02:19] it but of course that didn't change
[1:02:21] their Doctrine that's right why because
[1:02:25] God didn't reveal
[1:02:27] it if God don't reveal something to you
[1:02:29] and I it don't change us oh yeah we
[1:02:31] might get out of
[1:02:33] argu right you might ought to argue the
[1:02:36] person to where that they'll just get to
[1:02:37] word they won't say nothing while they
[1:02:39] around
[1:02:40] you right but you're not going to change
[1:02:42] their Doctrine right I'm not trying to
[1:02:44] convert anybody God has to do the
[1:02:47] converting look at the next one God
[1:02:50] hiding in Simplicity in Albuquerque New
[1:02:52] Mexico
[1:02:59] no good
[1:03:00] teacher I like
[1:03:03] that believes that the church the bride
[1:03:07] the church goes through the tribulation
[1:03:09] but not the bride the church goes
[1:03:11] through for purification you're under
[1:03:13] the six seal watch it right Israel does
[1:03:16] the same thing for the
[1:03:19] 144,000 but not the bride there the
[1:03:22] bride is Forgiven she goes straight to
[1:03:25] glory in her in a Rapture that's right
[1:03:28] see my opinion the last member will be
[1:03:30] caught up one of these days it might
[1:03:32] come and you wouldn't even you wouldn't
[1:03:36] wouldn't know nothing about it remember
[1:03:38] it's a secret secret catching away you
[1:03:41] come in an hour that you think not you
[1:03:43] won't know nothing about it she'll be
[1:03:44] gone be too late then that's right she's
[1:03:49] not going to have to go through it
[1:03:52] why because she's already forgiven
[1:03:57] like I
[1:03:59] said you mean you put your wife to a
[1:04:01] test before you'd marry
[1:04:04] her you know I'll give you 6 months now
[1:04:07] to prove I I used to I won't say where
[1:04:11] it was at cuz I'm trying to get a little
[1:04:13] better about it
[1:04:14] but this one man I heard in preacher he
[1:04:17] said he out in a certain area that a lot
[1:04:20] of people are didn't have inside
[1:04:22] Plumbing you know bathrooms and things
[1:04:24] in the houses they and Johnny
[1:04:27] houses and uh ain't nothing wrong with
[1:04:30] that cuz I was born and raised anyway
[1:04:33] but if if you can do better now here's
[1:04:34] my point and I heard this man personally
[1:04:36] say he
[1:04:38] said we moved out there and was living
[1:04:40] there and he was a preacher and he said
[1:04:44] my wife is proved to stand the
[1:04:47] test said I'm going to move her into a
[1:04:49] house where we got indoor
[1:04:53] plumbing she stood the T
[1:04:58] she washed out there and beat herself to
[1:05:00] death for no telling how long right I
[1:05:03] call it sorry but I don't I try to be
[1:05:06] nicer but you mean you make your wife
[1:05:10] especially when she's
[1:05:15] already covered by the
[1:05:18] blood now here's the way I am in plain
[1:05:20] language to
[1:05:23] you wife or husband all right or
[1:05:30] who if I ask you to forgive
[1:05:33] me and you say you forgive me
[1:05:36] right then I don't want to hear that no
[1:05:39] more right amen that's
[1:05:41] right right amen I say it's a sorry
[1:05:44] husband or a sorry
[1:05:46] wife both either One MH that would say
[1:05:50] if their husband asked them to forgive
[1:05:51] them their wife asked to forgive them
[1:05:53] for what they have done and they say I
[1:05:55] for forgive you now God takes your word
[1:05:58] and you're bound by
[1:06:00] it you ever bring that up again you are
[1:06:02] sorry low down hypocrite as far as I'm
[1:06:05] concerned worse than anything I can
[1:06:07] think of because you're bringing out
[1:06:08] from under the blood something's been
[1:06:09] put under the
[1:06:11] blood hey we're human we can't
[1:06:14] forget but we can keep our mouth shut
[1:06:18] and our attitude around people that's
[1:06:20] right I've had people to do things
[1:06:22] against me and they'd say forgive me and
[1:06:23] I say you're forgiven
[1:06:26] and that'll never be brought up again
[1:06:28] and you know what when I get around them
[1:06:31] I won't shy around you know I don't want
[1:06:34] to fool with you cuz you done me wrong
[1:06:36] one time now I know what the Bible says
[1:06:40] a heretic after the first and second
[1:06:42] order you count them not as a brother M
[1:06:45] so if you do it again to them in the
[1:06:47] same thing and I going tell you I
[1:06:48] forgive you but I ain't going to count
[1:06:50] you as brother if men on that's Bible
[1:06:53] right all right that's
[1:06:58] plain I Know a Man one time years ago
[1:07:00] and he run his wife off because she had
[1:07:02] done something wrong and I was there we
[1:07:04] went through exactly the way brother R
[1:07:06] we went the man came to the woman was
[1:07:08] there they confess everything the man
[1:07:11] told him right there in front of me and
[1:07:12] everybody he said I forgive you but he
[1:07:15] never would forget it he won't forget it
[1:07:18] till this
[1:07:19] day you talk to him 10 minutes he's
[1:07:22] going to be bringing it up
[1:07:26] that man knows what I done told him
[1:07:29] right I told him just what I told you
[1:07:31] you're a hypocrite when you say you'll
[1:07:34] forgive somebody and then you
[1:07:36] won't oh I'll forgive them just let them
[1:07:39] ask me the Bible don't say
[1:07:41] that
[1:07:43] right the Bible don't say forgive them
[1:07:46] if they
[1:07:48] ask if you're a Christian you forgive
[1:07:51] that's right sure we can't forget right
[1:07:55] but we
[1:07:57] forgive no matter if they ask or
[1:08:02] not cuz you see that's what God does
[1:08:05] right he's forgive us that's why the
[1:08:06] Bible
[1:08:07] said the Bible said how can you for how
[1:08:10] can he forgive you if you won't forgive
[1:08:12] somebody else well let him ask me I'll
[1:08:14] forget see that's not what the Bible
[1:08:16] says
[1:08:18] now right you people say to me say
[1:08:22] brother Dale I'm sorry what it said you
[1:08:23] never done it anyway I forgive you when
[1:08:26] you first Di and that's
[1:08:28] true and I never let it stand
[1:08:33] between see so just remember that's the
[1:08:35] way brother Dale thinks about
[1:08:36] forgiveness cuz that's maybe strong but
[1:08:39] it's right all right go to the next one
[1:08:41] brother
[1:08:42] Joe we didn't get that one on God in
[1:08:45] Simplicity did we 30:5 did we get
[1:08:48] through reading that one oh yeah okay go
[1:08:50] straight to glory and R okay number 8
[1:08:53] paragraph
[1:08:54] 87 conferences 1963
[1:08:57] 603 it's just part of the doing but what
[1:09:01] and the sixth one is the purification of
[1:09:03] the
[1:09:04] church the church of course goes through
[1:09:07] the tribulation period for purifying but
[1:09:11] the bride is
[1:09:13] raptured is the difference between the
[1:09:15] bride and the church amen the bride is
[1:09:20] raptured the church has to go through
[1:09:22] tribulation for purification amen all
[1:09:25] right which one do we want to be a part
[1:09:27] of going to the next one Jesus Christ
[1:09:29] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:31] paragraph 251
[1:09:36] 63627 but this is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:39] in the form of the Holy Spirit moving
[1:09:41] among his people doing the same thing he
[1:09:43] did when he was here on the earth
[1:09:44] identifying himself with his bride not
[1:09:47] the church there's a difference between
[1:09:49] the church in the bride not preaching
[1:09:51] Doctrine because I don't do that but to
[1:09:53] my humble belief the bride goes through
[1:09:56] this or the the church goes through the
[1:09:58] tribulation the sick seal are purify
[1:10:00] that's right but the bride don't she
[1:10:02] goes in the Rapture before that it's
[1:10:05] time for the bride to be called out so
[1:10:07] now I believe it's the calling out
[1:10:10] time there's a difference between the
[1:10:12] bride and the church the church goes
[1:10:15] through the tribulation
[1:10:18] right now brother Brown a lot of times
[1:10:20] we'll just use the word
[1:10:23] church you be using the word church
[1:10:25] talking about the bride cuz we are the
[1:10:27] church church means called
[1:10:30] out but now he's distinguishing to tell
[1:10:33] you a difference between the church and
[1:10:35] the bride and what's the difference the
[1:10:39] church will go through the
[1:10:41] tribulation but the bride goes in
[1:10:44] Rapture before the tribulation right go
[1:10:46] on to the next one
[1:10:48] perseverance paragraph
[1:10:50] 3563
[1:10:53] 802 now I'm not here preaching Doctrine
[1:10:56] cuz this was out not at the
[1:10:59] Tabernacle there is ministers on the
[1:11:01] platform here that would disagree
[1:11:03] probably with this most all ministers
[1:11:06] believe that the church goes through the
[1:11:08] tribulation period for
[1:11:10] purification I can't see it the blood of
[1:11:14] Jesus Christ is our purification nothing
[1:11:17] cleaner see see I believe that the
[1:11:20] church the denominational church and the
[1:11:22] sleeping virgins goes through the ration
[1:11:26] but not the bride there is a difference
[1:11:28] between the church and the bride the
[1:11:30] bride goes into the Rapture that's where
[1:11:32] you Church of God of Anderson all got
[1:11:35] mixed up there see is in that all right
[1:11:40] now going down to the next
[1:11:42] one how can I overcome paragraph 6 55
[1:11:47] 63825 the morning
[1:11:49] service but I can't agree with him cuz I
[1:11:52] don't see it but it doesn't pertain to
[1:11:55] Sal salvation that pertains to the
[1:11:56] coming of the Lord he sees that the
[1:11:58] church has to go through the tribulation
[1:12:00] period for purification I say the blood
[1:12:02] of Jesus Christ purified the church see
[1:12:05] it's not no I believe that the church
[1:12:07] goes through the tribulation period
[1:12:09] Church organization but the bride does
[1:12:11] not would you choose a woman you had to
[1:12:15] would you choose a woman you had to
[1:12:17] purify before you married her see
[1:12:19] Christ's bride is chosen and she is
[1:12:21] elected she is God's bride the Bride of
[1:12:24] Jesus Christ let's get to the last one
[1:12:26] and then we'll we'll have
[1:12:29] it which goes on
[1:12:35] down paragraph 55 and paragraph
[1:12:40] 56 he that believeth on
[1:12:43] me see right as G she she has no
[1:12:48] purification uh let me back up read the
[1:12:51] and now he said how you going to type
[1:12:53] that
[1:12:55] and this is a brother talking to a man
[1:12:58] if that bride Goes Forth goes up before
[1:13:02] she goes through the tribulation said I
[1:13:04] got scripture that shows you the church
[1:13:07] is in the tribulation period now he just
[1:13:09] said I gave you the quote that most
[1:13:11] ministers believed that the church would
[1:13:13] go through the tribulation he's talking
[1:13:14] to someone and I could probably name
[1:13:16] this one because I know that he had
[1:13:19] discussion he said that that was the
[1:13:21] difference he had with the brother about
[1:13:22] it right right I said just read the six
[1:13:26] seal that's all she is right there under
[1:13:30] the tribulation period see that's where
[1:13:32] the man thought it was all but find out
[1:13:34] just before that the bride is done gone
[1:13:37] yep see there's somebody under the six
[1:13:39] seal right there's a church but not the
[1:13:42] bride she done goone word revelation 4:1
[1:13:45] she's in glory at the time she has no
[1:13:47] purification he that believeth in me has
[1:13:50] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:13:51] condemnation or the Judgment but has
[1:13:54] passed from death and to life Christ
[1:13:56] gave the promise that we would not even
[1:13:58] stand it to judgment so freely did he
[1:14:01] take my place until I'm absolutely free
[1:14:05] when I'm pardoned I'm pardoned right how
[1:14:08] can he take me out of the pawn shop got
[1:14:10] a clean receipt yeah how can he be my
[1:14:15] redeemer and take me from the
[1:14:17] p take me from the pun shop and the
[1:14:21] broker still say I belong to him I got a
[1:14:24] written receipt amen see wrot by the
[1:14:26] blood of Jesus Christ now in that here
[1:14:29] is where we come now watch we're going
[1:14:31] to get to something right here cuz I
[1:14:33] didn't choose to bring the rest of it
[1:14:36] but now here's
[1:14:38] my written receipt
[1:14:41] right anybody on tell can see I'm
[1:14:43] holding up the
[1:14:46] Bible the Bible is my written
[1:14:49] receipt that I don't have to be in the
[1:14:51] pawn shop right that God paid my price y
[1:14:57] that's right I don't have to be there
[1:14:59] right I'm purified why would you have
[1:15:01] all the scriptures and the things about
[1:15:02] the bride and how beautiful she is if
[1:15:05] you're going to make her go through the
[1:15:09] tribulation why would you have that so
[1:15:12] watch what he said now how are you going
[1:15:14] to get separate that electric bride you
[1:15:17] talk about now how are you going to put
[1:15:19] that under a
[1:15:23] top and the man ask brother random how
[1:15:25] you going to put it under a
[1:15:28] tie and you know what he told him to get
[1:15:31] so let's turn over there and read it
[1:15:32] well brother Joe's going to pull it
[1:15:34] up he told him he said let's go to
[1:15:36] Matthew
[1:15:41] 27
[1:15:44] right and
[1:15:46] watch and behold the veil of the temple
[1:15:49] was R in Twain From the top to the
[1:15:50] bottom and the Earth did quake and the
[1:15:51] Rocks rent and the graves were open and
[1:15:54] many bodies of the Saints which slep
[1:15:55] arose and came out of the Grave after
[1:15:58] his resurrection and went into the holy
[1:15:59] city and appeared unto many now that's
[1:16:03] the scripture he
[1:16:06] gave can you look at that scripture and
[1:16:08] see that the bride don't have to go
[1:16:10] through the
[1:16:18] tribulation I'm just asking you can you
[1:16:20] look at it that's reason I chose not to
[1:16:21] use the rest of the quote part
[1:16:25] you go into that message and read the
[1:16:26] rest of it and see what he
[1:16:29] said but can you really look at that
[1:16:32] scripture and say the bride don't have
[1:16:35] to go through the tribulation because
[1:16:36] Matthew
[1:16:38] 27 51-53 says
[1:16:43] it
[1:16:45] okay and behold the veil of the temple
[1:16:48] was rent in Twain from top to the bottom
[1:16:51] and the Earth did Quake the Rocks rent
[1:16:52] now what was that
[1:16:55] that was at his resurrection
[1:16:58] right now brother random if you reading
[1:17:01] go on down below where this is at you
[1:17:03] see him say see the
[1:17:05] law was done
[1:17:10] away when the veil was rent right Jesus
[1:17:14] Christ rose from the
[1:17:16] dead this thing was happening it was
[1:17:19] ending the
[1:17:20] law right now law is man's carnality of
[1:17:26] reading y Paul thought it was
[1:17:32] spiritual right
[1:17:35] right but it was death he
[1:17:38] said what was death when when the law
[1:17:41] was the word of God that's right but it
[1:17:44] was Paul's interpretation of the
[1:17:47] law or thoughts of the
[1:17:51] law see the law ended when Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] rose from the
[1:17:57] dead but he paid the price
[1:18:01] right now it ended in one point
[1:18:06] what it ended the letter of the word
[1:18:09] that kth because it made a
[1:18:13] way for a new
[1:18:16] birth and that would be then the Bible
[1:18:18] would say that Christ then is the end of
[1:18:20] the law for righteousness to them that
[1:18:23] believe
[1:18:25] you ever heard a good Baptist preach
[1:18:27] that he preached it when the
[1:18:29] Resurrection come the law ended y so we
[1:18:32] can't be condemned by the law anymore I
[1:18:35] can live anything I want to cuz there's
[1:18:37] no
[1:18:38] law you ain't never heard him preach
[1:18:44] now but Jesus come to magnify the law
[1:18:48] right that's what he said about now
[1:18:51] right he come to make it honorable right
[1:18:56] see the law never ended people are say
[1:18:58] today we're not under the
[1:19:01] law unless you're borned again right
[1:19:04] you're still under the law cuz the law
[1:19:07] is carnal Commandments right amen but
[1:19:10] brother today we're in the New Testament
[1:19:12] you're not in the New Testament without
[1:19:13] the New Birth the new birth came on the
[1:19:15] day of Pentecost right if you have the
[1:19:18] new birth you're in the New Testament
[1:19:21] right if you don't have the new birth
[1:19:23] you're still under the law LA right
[1:19:29] right come on you don't hear people talk
[1:19:31] like that do you because they don't like
[1:19:33] that we're under grace
[1:19:37] work the only way you're under grace is
[1:19:39] because you're born again right right
[1:19:43] that's
[1:19:44] right Christ ended the law for
[1:19:47] righteousness for them that believe amen
[1:19:51] right people are going to be condemned
[1:19:53] by the law to why thr
[1:19:56] judment but that we
[1:19:59] miss come on I hope you're following
[1:20:01] what I'm
[1:20:04] saying if you're not born again if I'm
[1:20:06] not born again today I'm still under the
[1:20:08] law that's right the same law that David
[1:20:11] gave we don't give we don't do
[1:20:14] sacrifices No More Jesus Christ is My
[1:20:18] Sacrifice don't go with the carnality
[1:20:21] that's
[1:20:22] right Jesus Christ become my sacrifice
[1:20:25] but if I don't have the life of the one
[1:20:28] that paid the price I've only got a man
[1:20:32] dying right now come on is that what
[1:20:34] they preach in River Jordan just a man
[1:20:36] died y do you still under the law right
[1:20:41] no no no we're in the New Testament cuz
[1:20:43] it says it right
[1:20:46] here then you ask people say well what's
[1:20:49] the first book of the New Testament
[1:20:51] they'll turn to
[1:20:52] Matthew that's right is that
[1:20:55] true that's not the first book of the
[1:20:58] New
[1:20:59] Testament I don't care what you got
[1:21:01] written in your Bible somebody wrote
[1:21:02] that on
[1:21:04] there the book of Acts is the New
[1:21:09] Testament the New Testament was not
[1:21:12] enforced Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:21:15] Jesus is say the other day came under
[1:21:17] the law to redeem them that were under
[1:21:19] the law amen he would even tell them
[1:21:21] under Matthew Mark Luke and John go make
[1:21:23] the sacrifice with m
[1:21:27] but where do you hear it after the day
[1:21:28] of
[1:21:29] Pentecost y there no sacrifice of Moses
[1:21:33] after the Pentecost right
[1:21:37] amen but you say well I what do you mean
[1:21:40] brother I I read right it says right
[1:21:43] there in my
[1:21:45] Bible right right right there look at
[1:21:49] it
[1:21:50] you it's a new testament that's not here
[1:21:54] on this one
[1:21:57] we're not under the Old Testament I show
[1:22:00] me how you got from under
[1:22:05] it how did you get out from under the
[1:22:07] Old
[1:22:10] Testament see these are the things we
[1:22:13] missed that we thought we believe to be
[1:22:18] true we miss a lot of things by being
[1:22:21] the Bride of Jesus Christ that we
[1:22:23] thought to be true
[1:22:26] why do you think people thinks they have
[1:22:27] to go through the
[1:22:31] tribulation cuz they don't believe that
[1:22:33] they're
[1:22:35] pure and if you don't believe you're
[1:22:37] pure you're not pure right that's
[1:22:41] right if you don't believe that you're
[1:22:43] pure you're not
[1:22:44] pure you're under the tribulation and
[1:22:47] will go through the tribulation unless
[1:22:49] you're born
[1:22:50] again only the Born Again people will
[1:22:53] miss the tribulation
[1:22:57] right we're not in the New Testament
[1:22:59] just because it that we could read out
[1:23:01] of some
[1:23:04] book the Old Testament never ended at
[1:23:07] Calvary like we think it ended right it
[1:23:10] ended only for the born the person who
[1:23:12] would go to Pentecost and receive the
[1:23:14] new birth right the world is still under
[1:23:17] the Ten
[1:23:22] Commandments and not only that it's
[1:23:25] worse because the Ten Commandments have
[1:23:27] been
[1:23:30] magnified Y come on Jesus said you heard
[1:23:32] it old th shalt not commit adultery but
[1:23:35] I say unto thee to look on a woman with
[1:23:38] lust in your heart you've committed
[1:23:39] adultery already he magnified the law
[1:23:44] right that's what Paul was saying he
[1:23:46] said I thought this that I read that I
[1:23:49] kept and didn't do or done was my life
[1:23:52] was giving me eternal life he he said I
[1:23:54] found it to be my
[1:23:58] death he said but then I found Christ
[1:24:02] right Christ is the end of the law
[1:24:04] then but I don't have to go through the
[1:24:07] tribulation pull that quote back up
[1:24:08] brother
[1:24:12] Joe CU we want to dwell on that
[1:24:16] minut so then what happened the prophet
[1:24:19] says he said give me a typ he said
[1:24:23] your's your typ
[1:24:25] yep evidently the man didn't care for
[1:24:27] him using the one of
[1:24:29] Noah that's good enough for me wouldn't
[1:24:31] you right and brother Ram said cuz I
[1:24:34] remember when I first saw that he said
[1:24:37] Noah rose up went over come back down
[1:24:39] died a
[1:24:41] drunk he said but Enoch went into
[1:24:43] Rapture y he said see there the bride
[1:24:47] don't have to go through the
[1:24:50] tribulation now listen Church the reason
[1:24:54] you don't have to go through the
[1:24:55] tribulation cuz you can turn right over
[1:24:56] here and read you're already there yeah
[1:24:58] right you turn over here if you want to
[1:25:00] know what God thinks about you turn over
[1:25:02] Revelation 21:22 and read
[1:25:07] it if you want to see yourself already
[1:25:09] now read
[1:25:11] it cuz it tell somebody it's going to be
[1:25:13] there why can't we believe it's us
[1:25:15] am amen but now where we at we're still
[1:25:18] on
[1:25:21] this now here's his proof
[1:25:26] because when the law ended it didn't end
[1:25:28] just a letter right
[1:25:33] right when the law ended now catch this
[1:25:35] it didn't end just a letter something
[1:25:39] took place to
[1:25:40] prove before even the day of
[1:25:45] Pentecost that the bride wouldn't going
[1:25:47] to have to go through the
[1:25:51] tribulation something took place but
[1:25:54] took
[1:25:55] place when the law
[1:25:57] ended Christ stepped on the scene right
[1:26:01] right and the graves were open and many
[1:26:04] bodies of the Saints which slept arose
[1:26:07] and came out of the graves after his
[1:26:09] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:26:12] and appeared to
[1:26:13] many
[1:26:15] y you say but brother
[1:26:19] dor that's the Old
[1:26:22] Testament people
[1:26:25] I'm glad you thought of
[1:26:28] that cuz that's exactly
[1:26:33] right right but what's your
[1:26:37] thinking well that's just the Old
[1:26:39] Testament
[1:26:42] science now would that not be the Bride
[1:26:45] of
[1:26:46] Jehovah are you with me yes come on do I
[1:26:50] need the quotes to bring where brother R
[1:26:51] said Jehovah had a bride Jesus had a
[1:26:53] bride
[1:26:54] yep yep right do I have to prove that
[1:26:57] and go over and over it or do you
[1:26:59] understand it the Old Testament people
[1:27:01] was Jehovah's
[1:27:03] bride
[1:27:06] right they were the ones that raised
[1:27:08] this is not a new testament Resurrection
[1:27:10] he's given you the Old Testament
[1:27:11] Resurrection but giv it to you to prove
[1:27:14] go read the rest of that quote he's
[1:27:16] given it to you to prove that the bride
[1:27:18] don't go through the tribulation that's
[1:27:20] his
[1:27:22] scripture because if God thought enough
[1:27:24] of the Bride the Old Testament to raise
[1:27:28] her before the
[1:27:32] tribulation don't you know for sure that
[1:27:34] he's going to raise his
[1:27:38] bride come on Church don't you know for
[1:27:41] sure that he's going to raise his bride
[1:27:43] before the
[1:27:47] tribulation Jehovah's bride never went
[1:27:49] through won't go through the tribulation
[1:27:51] that way now the 144,000 things over
[1:27:54] here won't be Jehovah's
[1:27:56] bride so don't think he can catch
[1:27:59] us 144,000 will not be Jehovah's
[1:28:04] bride I know some people in this message
[1:28:06] that preach it will be yep but they
[1:28:09] can't be because they're servants that's
[1:28:12] right brother R said what they're going
[1:28:13] to be in the Millennium about page 14 or
[1:28:15] somewhere in our first first few pages
[1:28:17] of the church age book he said they'll
[1:28:19] be in the millennial Reign he said but
[1:28:21] they'll be our servants
[1:28:25] right they will never be able to come
[1:28:27] forth as Jehovah's bride because they
[1:28:30] rejected it right
[1:28:34] y so then the prophet's perfectly
[1:28:39] right the Old Testament Saints raises
[1:28:42] and went up to the city before the
[1:28:44] tribulation never takes
[1:28:45] place you see why he's using that
[1:28:47] scripture evidently that man that he was
[1:28:49] talking
[1:28:51] to that he said I know he don't agree
[1:28:54] with
[1:28:55] me evidently that man didn't get it by
[1:28:59] seeing that Noah went up over but Enoch
[1:29:04] went into
[1:29:05] Rapture brother R said there's not one
[1:29:07] scripture the man had just got through
[1:29:09] saying to brother brandom we read in a
[1:29:11] quote he said brother brand I got quote
[1:29:13] I got scripture that says a bride will
[1:29:16] go through the
[1:29:18] tribulation brother around said ain't no
[1:29:21] scripture so whatever the man had
[1:29:24] wouldn't be
[1:29:25] right it was man's carnality placed in
[1:29:28] some form of a scripture cuz the Bride
[1:29:31] of Jesus Christ The Bride of the
[1:29:34] Jehovah she don't have to come
[1:29:38] forth she's already come
[1:29:41] forth to prove it that she don't go
[1:29:44] through the
[1:29:48] tribulation we don't have to go through
[1:29:49] the tribulation either why because we're
[1:29:51] born again Christians we are the bride
[1:29:53] ofes Jesus Christ so we don't have to go
[1:29:56] through it we've done missed
[1:29:59] it by being born again you miss the
[1:30:01] tribulation
[1:30:04] right by being born again you miss
[1:30:08] having to stand before the white Throne
[1:30:14] judgment by being born again we miss
[1:30:21] Armageddon the great horrible things
[1:30:23] that are going to happen in the
[1:30:25] tribulation of being born
[1:30:28] again no wonder that brother around said
[1:30:31] that baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[1:30:32] most important part thing of your
[1:30:35] life right whether you got it or
[1:30:40] not don't Dilly Around Church find out
[1:30:44] whether you got it or not I would to God
[1:30:47] that I could preach to this church so
[1:30:49] hard until everybody in here one 100 of
[1:30:51] us or how many they are now of us that
[1:30:53] never everybody in here would find out
[1:30:55] they wern't born again if that's the way
[1:30:57] it is cuz then you could do something
[1:30:59] about
[1:31:00] it then you'd start seeking
[1:31:02] God but what's so hard to try to preach
[1:31:05] to his people says I got it I got it the
[1:31:07] reason I got it I know I got it cuz I
[1:31:08] believe the prophet well the devil got
[1:31:11] it he believes a prophet now where you
[1:31:14] going to put
[1:31:15] yourself that's right that's why I love
[1:31:18] the prophet's message cuz it's in the
[1:31:20] Bible
[1:31:21] right the bride don't go through the
[1:31:24] tribulation because Jehovah's bride
[1:31:25] don't go through the
[1:31:27] tribulation that's what he
[1:31:32] said see that's scripture
[1:31:36] for when are we going to believe what
[1:31:38] God
[1:31:42] says Revelations 3:10 brother Joe pull
[1:31:45] it look what it says about this
[1:31:55] this is in the church age book right
[1:31:57] this I mean the church Age series right
[1:31:59] because thou H has kept the word of my
[1:32:01] patience I will keep thee from the hour
[1:32:04] of Temptation which shall come upon all
[1:32:06] the world to try them that dwell upon
[1:32:10] the Earth
[1:32:14] Yep the things we
[1:32:16] miss are being part of the bride of
[1:32:20] Christ look what so much he thinks of US
[1:32:22] 1 Corinthians
[1:32:25] 63 know ye not that you shall judge
[1:32:31] Angels how much more things that pertain
[1:32:34] to this
[1:32:37] life by being the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:39] we're going to judge Angels
[1:32:42] right they'll have to stand before
[1:32:46] us and be
[1:32:49] judged we don't have to go to the white
[1:32:52] Throne we set on the white throne
[1:32:55] right what an honor it is read the book
[1:32:56] of Revelations we gave it the other day
[1:32:58] and read the book of Daniel Daniel
[1:33:02] 7 and see that those books were
[1:33:06] open
[1:33:08] amen and that we sit on the throne with
[1:33:12] him judging
[1:33:18] others it won't be a fact that we'll set
[1:33:20] up there
[1:33:22] as prow boastful right no it' be an
[1:33:27] honor Amen to sit
[1:33:30] there you know
[1:33:33] right being honored to know the
[1:33:36] judge I remember some people used to go
[1:33:38] to church here that daughter got a
[1:33:41] ticket and I won't call her names but
[1:33:43] the daughter got a ticket policeman you
[1:33:46] know so she had to go to
[1:33:48] court well she was scared to death you
[1:33:50] know like any young girl was you know
[1:33:52] kind of worried
[1:33:55] but but when they walked in her and her
[1:33:58] daddy walked
[1:34:01] in you know to stand before the
[1:34:04] judge judge looked down and say well
[1:34:07] hello
[1:34:08] there and called his name she said I
[1:34:12] felt
[1:34:14] good she said cuz I figured the case
[1:34:16] would already
[1:34:18] closed cuz the judge knows my
[1:34:21] daddy you know
[1:34:24] well that's a good illustration right
[1:34:28] but what about what the prophet give
[1:34:30] that's right when the judge the jury and
[1:34:34] he said even the prosecutor amen is on
[1:34:37] your side that's
[1:34:39] right you know there'll come a time when
[1:34:42] we stand there and sit with him that
[1:34:43] Satan can't even Point his accusing
[1:34:45] finger
[1:34:48] amen he can't Point his finger at
[1:34:51] us cuz God says no
[1:34:54] all over with Bible says he's up there
[1:34:56] right now accusing the Brethren right
[1:34:59] but till come a day he can't do that
[1:35:02] right and it'll be the day when the
[1:35:03] bride realizes who she is amen that's
[1:35:05] right and the purpose we're here on
[1:35:07] Earth right is to believe God's word
[1:35:11] amen and to take his word and stand on
[1:35:13] it amen but you see we don't have to go
[1:35:15] through those horrible things that you
[1:35:17] read of in the Book of Revelation why
[1:35:18] because you turn on over to the back of
[1:35:20] the book and just read she's already
[1:35:22] there m m that's
[1:35:26] right like the prophet said then you
[1:35:28] don't have no scripture for the bride
[1:35:30] going through the tribulation amen the
[1:35:33] church yes he said y she has to go for
[1:35:36] the
[1:35:37] purification was it not the bride said
[1:35:39] she's already
[1:35:40] pure and the last thought I wrote
[1:35:43] down look what it means to be the bride
[1:35:46] of Christ and see the
[1:35:49] book that was opened and how it revealed
[1:35:52] all of these things
[1:35:54] to us y truly it is an open
[1:35:59] book that's right Search the
[1:36:05] book you know I read in this book that
[1:36:07] I'm just as perfect as he is right amen
[1:36:10] that's right you know that by being born
[1:36:13] again you miss going to hell am that's
[1:36:17] right you know that by being born again
[1:36:19] somebody's going to miss dying amen
[1:36:25] right why can't I believe that I'm one
[1:36:27] of them I'm getting too old to not
[1:36:30] believe
[1:36:32] it brother said the other day 80 years
[1:36:35] old he said said people was preaching
[1:36:38] this message he said somebody said to
[1:36:41] him and said man you're 80 years old he
[1:36:42] said so what y for long I won't be with
[1:36:46] God one way or the
[1:36:49] other either because I'm dying a old age
[1:36:52] or because I'm going to be raptured
[1:36:54] well that's a good point amen why AR we
[1:36:56] worried that's right amen I've done read
[1:36:59] the book amen amen I told you how I used
[1:37:03] to make my book reports i' read the
[1:37:05] introduction to get who the who they was

[1:37:10] book John and Mary lived happily ever
[1:37:12] after and I wrote some of the funn
[1:37:14] stories probably about John and Mary
[1:37:16] that never even was in print nowhere but
[1:37:18] you don't want I to get a good grade out
[1:37:20] of it
[1:37:23] until he found out I was copied my
[1:37:25] sister's
[1:37:27] reports then the teacher got on to
[1:37:30] it listen
