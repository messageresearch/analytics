the way we're supposed to be that's why we're that's why we're trying to go up this statue of perfect man that's why we're going to try to lay aside our our differences in Malice and Grievances and and have some Temperance and patience and but we got to have some virtue and knowledge first so we're going to continue on we had a real good weekend man it was great Still Still basking over the uh the things that the Lord did for us and and used brother Lawson in a wonderful way we appreciate that he sent his greetings back today he left his coat here so I just had to mail it back to him so he said thank you very much he he's going on up north brother Sean Martin so it's kind of cool up there so but Georgia weather don't worry about it we don't need a coat now tomorrow we may the next day we may not we may need one may not so but uh I like living in Georgia anyway I'll take it I don't want to live anywhere else let's go through a few of these announcements remember the wedding ceremony and reception on Friday the March 24th everything's downstairs on the um side of the refrigerator it's at two o'clock March 24th it will be in Beaufort South Carolina that would be for um whatever her name is Esther and whatever his name is Micah for Esther and Micah I remember that um coming up in March which will only be a few weeks away and then Terence announced but brother Joe um y'all going to nursing home to this coming weekend at 10 o'clock those of you that are going get my brother Joey here tonight just get with him and make out a plan all right also remember this coming Saturday there'll be no Bible study we're going to have it every other month this year because then every other month besides that every other month we're going to have a youth service all right also remember now on the 14th that will be next the next Saturday will be a prayer service now I know that um brother Louise and brother Bob and brother Michael and sister Nyla Nikki going no what's up oh she's here whoops she's here tonight Jordan River you going too wow you come a little early okay but they're leaving Wednesday so what Sunday is we're going to have both Services we're going to take up an offering for them the church is going to provide the plane tickets for Bob and and brother Louise now because they're ministers here and they do this from the church so we'll be paying for their for their plane fare but we'll also be giving them some extra money if you want to give anything the the offering now tithing goes to the church to whatever you pay your child into the church but if you have a special offering um write a check give them cash that will be for them to use over there I thank God that some of our youth are going I wish every one of our youth would go one time overseas you'd come back with a lot different attitude when you see all the luxuries I was thinking yesterday you look at America and what we call Expendable income which is paying you know seventy thousand dollars for a vehicle uh having somebody keep up your lawn for a hundred dollars a week you go and having a pedicure and a and uh whatever else it is a maybe in a petty all the things that you do they just survive over there they can't fathom driving a seventy thousand dollar car they can't fathom going and having a new set of clothes every week that's just not in there that's just not in their budget um clean water is in their budget you and I drink water and go get bottled water and we get all this other stuff I thought man all the reason I saw that was some boats that went by that were being pulled by seventy thousand dollar trucks and it's probably a fifty thousand dollar uh bass boat and all the other things to go with it I thought man that would take a you could take a whole church and Nicaraguan you could build it build a pastor a house just by what drove by me one car we've been blessed in this United States but I promise you one thing we're going to be cursed Above All Nations according to what the prophet said because we turn the nation turn God down amen so let's just we're going to pray with them Sunday also before they leave we'll have them come up and we'll have prayer for them this coming Sunday so just remember that keep that in your prayer bring some extra money for them to take with them and do as they see fit uh don't bring it back once it's yours is yours we don't want it all right now the 28th that will be Saturday at three o'clock brother Daryl Ward will be here and we will have a um uh Saturday youth service at three on the 29th brother Daryl be with us again one service remember on February the 11th we're having our Valentine's Banquet just remember that if you bring in somebody uh be thirty dollars for a couple that's not a Kyle's pair of this church if you want to bring somebody that'll be thirty dollars you need to let Anna and Lisa know they're already starting to get things together because because it's going to be a uh a big event always has been it always will be so we sure appreciate brother down sister Dale for working on it and allowing us to have it this how many 15 years maybe or more we've had this this ever every time had it in three inches of snow what was that a couple years ago or last year sometime last year was last year we gonna pray that don't happen we're going to pray that Georgia weather will take over and if it snows two days later we'll be able to wear short sleeves the next day all right so thank Lord for that just keep these things into prayer I know we all have yes ma'am sign up sheet on the refrigerator for everyone that's going to attend and we would love for you to come if you're uh if you're married uh it's for married couples only all right so uh that would be the time that that we set aside that we'll brother Dutch Scott will will be speaking about 20 minutes and then we'll have all the other festivities uh catered meal and um cake and and cupcakes and stuff like that both names down just don't say the Dale couple put the two persons names yes so if you're bringing somebody you John Alicia and me and Jim they're bringing us this year you didn't know that did you but just remember that it's to keep everything in order to know what we order because it's going to be a catered meal it's going to be you know close to 20 bucks for a meal per person so um we want to know exactly we don't want to have a bunch of food left over right so and the church is paying for all that so let's go to the Lord in prayer I I appreciate everyone this weekend back again doing what you did you brought food you you took out trash uh brother Ryan some of the young guys they took out trash for us and and helped the sisters we appreciate that we were here till probably two o'clock in the morning um Sunday morning fellowshipping and and then cleaning up but we sure do appreciate everybody and we appreciate Sister Lisa for cleaning this mess up so let's give her a hand we try not to leave it messy but we're humans we just make masses you know we we talk and try to eat at the same time and that just don't work amen so just keep just to keep all these uh as brother Terence said the 22nd officers we got to to vote on that on January 22nd so just keep that in prayer Bob when are you all going to be back the Monday Monday the 23rd okay all right okay well I was going to write on my calendars not because what I just said I just thought about it and I asked brother Joe and he didn't know so we're going to be 23rd I need to write that on my calendar brother Aaron you will be doing double duty while they're gone you'll be doing next Wednesday and the Wednesday after that okay got it okay so while they're gone we will uh continue on to have service so but just keep them in prayer um it's tough going to another country it really is I mean they accommodate you the best they can but but like I said before we're used to you know clean sheets and and if you heard brother Wayne uh some of his testimony not up here but won't in private about some of the places he's been that you know just you lay down on a board for two or three days a board and you preach your heart out three services a day and they feed you something that he said one time he said he said they said do you want to eat this and he said would I offend you if I didn't they said no he said well I'm not going to eat that because they told him what it was and it was some pretty you know anyway let's go to the Lord in prayer but thank you again have a wonderful New Year we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for all the things you've done this past year if it wasn't for you guys we wouldn't have church a church is Sovereign but you know what the church is Sovereign because of the people it's not sovereign because one man rules the whole place except the Holy Ghost but it's Sovereign because the people are in this building all right it's you that make this thing go not all it's not us and you pull on the gift tonight we'll see what the Lord has for us dear heavenly father Lord we pray that you should be with us and the first one of the service Lord come Among Us in a in a way Lord that that will all understand Lord that you're trying your best to get your people to see that you're here and that you want the characteristics of your life and your own body to be into this group of people now that we are your body and we're going to talk about that a little bit tonight about a virtuous woman and Lord I pray that you just be with the ones Lord that are sick sister Freda uh brother Louise if I miss one I'm sorry but all the sister Janine different ones Lord I pray that should be with him and touch them Lord and take that away from them that they will be raised up Lord especially brother Louise and brother Bob I pray Lord tonight that you would protect them and the ones that are going to I pray that you would protect them and keep them safe from sickness and from disease and from any kind of form of of evil that wants to come among them Lord I pray that you would protect them with the angels of the Lord father be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields and many ones that we hear from Lord Brother brother Boaz sent messages saying Happy New Year and that they were baptizing people and getting Church age books out and and Hebrew series books and we thank you Lord for that that they're able to get the word of God here we are sitting with a library that we can put in our pocket and they're just wanting one book Lord how fortunate underway please don't let us pass this opportunity by to give this message to A Dying World father we pray that you should be with us now in a further with his service in Jesus name we pray amen starting your stuff blew up over here it's on a man part 79 all right in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can go into them when we look at this why don't we read this every time we read this every Sunday we read this every Wednesday when we preach but that word was made flesh because of a situation that it the Flesh of Adam and Eve fell anybody with me so it's got to come back then through flesh your kinsman redeemer is going to have to be everything he said he was flesh everything he said he was had to come flesh that's why the prophet tells us many many many thousands of time in the message the fullness of the godhead bodily was in Jesus Christ and now we know that by the transforming power of the Holy Ghost that same holy ghost that same person is in me and you all right called the brides so now the word that Jesus spoke is now being made flesh in US dwelt Among Us dwelling Among Us and absolutely supposed to be taking over our life y'all can say Amen if you want to you have my permission 31 we're going to get to this a little bit this afternoon or this evening who can find who can find a virtuous woman boy that's kind of hard to do in this old United States of America and around the world because they can't keep their self and you know what's happening around the world the denominations can't keep their self Satan has crept in so much and give them false Doctrine and a lot of them even in the message because a virtuous woman is a woman that won't take just anything she's pure she's holy she's right she's righteous I'm going to read this to you in just a minute Genesis 2 9 says and out of the ground now we're going to get to knowledge maybe a little bit later but definitely Sunday we're going to talk about knowledge which is the next virtue and and knowledge my knowledge up brother Wayne was speaking Friday night and he was laying some words out and I was writing them down because you can take knowledge to wise unwise no knowledge wisdom Spirit of wisdom understanding being known that's all got to do with knowledge but now there's two kinds of knowledge there's one in the Bible Genesis 2 9 says out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food now that's natural botany life everybody with me say Amen that was botany life he says that little whatever that is semicolon stop and think a minute because I'm fixing to change my thought the Tree of Life the tree of life was not a tree it was a person to Jesus Christ everybody with me all right and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil which was the devil everybody with me on that now if they would have eaten of the tree of knowledge I mean of of Life they were to live Tree of Life Tree of Life but no we decided to eat off the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and that's how we got here and that's how that we have even grow up that's why you'll see brother Brown say over here he'll say the educations of the devil well if we let that kind of education rule our life yes it is of the devil if they tell you if science tells you that it was a big bang theory if science tells you that we came from this or that or the other don't take that knowledge we're going to take Godly knowledge because there is a certain thing called Godly knowledge watch this right here but now we want knowledge not just first grade knowledge everybody with me we don't want just for now first grade knowledge is good some of you may have been smart enough to skip a grade some of you may not and Miss degrading all right that's natural but in God it's the same way you can sit here in the view and you can you can learn nothing or you can sit here and you can just go right on up that pyramid and the guy sitting beside of you or the lady sitting beside of you is not getting nothing it's up to you remember brother Ryan said he's building individuals we'll read that quote just a little bit Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall teach knowledge so it's got to be taught to you all right and Whom Shall he make to understand what Doctrine you can't do without Doctrine you got to have Doctrine there's what there's false Doctrine and then there's real Doctrine all right all right look and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine he's asking a question and then he's going to answer the question them that are what weaned from the milk not still drinking milk weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast listen we draw from El Shady eye we know that the breasted one but you're gonna have to get off of them every once in a while you're gonna have to grow up he don't want you to be a crybaby all your Christian Life he wants us to grow up and eat some what Paul says we'll get it to it a little bit later not today but strong meat that's for us strongly as we go up to Statue of perfect man I want you to understand this is a Christian Life foreign if you want to Isaiah 53 10 says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief well Thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days in the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many so it's the knowledge of God given not to a second person called Jesus it's the same God moving into another office and being able to as the prophet said condescend I want us to see God had to come down here to get us to go there all right so he had to come down here live a life so that we even have an example we have no other example except Jesus Christ all right you want Judas uh please you want Peter you want Peter BC before Christ no you want Paul BC Paul had Christians killed he said he did it wasn't just a rumor it's in the Bible he said I caused him to blaspheme he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant what justify many so now we bring in knowledge together to where it's going to justify many because we're going to read here in just a few minutes where brother Brown calls us The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ Justified never did it in the first place all right that's what you and I got to come to because if not you're going to fight you're going to fight your old nature you're going to fight your old person you're going to fight fight and we listen it's a fight anyway for he shall bear their iniquities who mine and yours John 17 17. so let's start here now sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is part truth that's not what it said Thy Word is truth as thou has sent men to the world Jesus Christ so have I also sent them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth through what the truth now what is sanctification it's red is there anybody with me sanctification's red even the second horse rider is read excuse me but sanctification you're only Sanctified by the blood right remember you're kept saved by the blood of Jesus Christ in other words the washing of the Water by the word but that water is blood all right you can pour gallons and gallons of water on top of your head you will not get clean where you need to be clean but you can take the blood of Jesus Christ and plead the blood of Jesus Christ and God will clean you up amen he'll not be able to see your sin he'll hear your voice through that and I want us to get to that that also they might also be Sanctified through the truth now I want to look here and stop just for a second now what is sanctification brother Brown tells us it's a compound word we know this we and I want to give you all some uh reach your hand out like this everybody reach your hand out like this go backwards like this and pat yourself on the back brother Wayne said he had not felt it's free to preach in the church as he had here and I mean he may have but he said this weekend was just it just flowed he didn't have to stop he just went right on through and I appreciate it he's because we've been taught well amen [Applause] or drinking milk you got to bring more quotes to prove what you're talking about you got to bring more time to go back and say this but he said no he said I just want to straight through because we don't we don't need every quote we know them we know him by heart that's why amen quotes you have to amen quotes if somebody reads you a quote you better amen it not their quote brother Brown's quote right so sanctification is clean and set aside for service now we know that in the stuck here somewhere the first part of sanctification though is in your soul it takes and cleans out your soul where does that unclean Spirit go out of let's bring that chart up if you don't mind real quick because I wanna everybody even the young ones to understand what we're talking about they'll give them a second to pull it up there it is all right just can you move it up a little bit more there you go now we know that we have a body a spirit and a soul everybody with me all right we've been through this this is actually a chart that brother Dale used many many years ago all right so we see that the body is what the body is going up to the go to the very bottom because that's where the uh seed tastes still smelling here now there's nothing you can do about that that is given to you as the prophet said to what to contact this world see taste feel smelling here but every one of those can be absolutely deceived every one of those I thought I heard a no it wasn't that I thought I saw him like I said before Jim makes many concoctions at the B Store and we can make dirt out of out of a liquid because man has put the chemical chemicals together if you close your eyes and smell that soap it's like somebody's got a piece of dirt in her hand so it can be what these can all be deceived that's why Satan can move in and out through those but he goes on into that middle realm the next one which is what imagination conscious memory reason and affection everybody with me all right now when you're born again when you're born again see if this still works we haven't used it in a long time if we do this tonight maybe I'll keep you awake well you can't really see that can you okay this is your stall this is the person of you and there's only two things you can be in your soul and that you can have the faith of God or the doubt of the devil there's no end there's no tweener all right but now when you go through baby form when you go through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost what are we dealing with we're dealing with this guy right here everybody okay we're dealing with this inner man this Center of you the heart that's what God's got to change first man's tried to change here and here but left that alone you got to get in the holy of holies where God is or is not and that unclean spirit that adamic nature that you're that that's attached to your soul when you were born as a baby you got a soul is everybody with me you got a soul something that fires you that that's your being it may it helps makes you breathe it makes you do all the things of life and it also does what your intelligence this is where your intelligence comes from not here as a man thinketh that his heart you say no I think out here no you're thinking here as a man thinketh in his heart so is he all right so now when the Bible says in the Book of Luke that the unclean Spirit goes out of a man it's not here it's here that means there's something that's unclean in your throne room okay as many people in the message say that you've got you've already got this at Birth brother Brown said it's not faith and doubt come on somebody it's Faith or doubt you can't have both of these dwelling in a vessel at the same time you're either lost are you born again one of the two all right now you have representation a predestination there is a seed but it's in the mind of God that seed is a word right it's not a little they always try to make it some little speck you know it's a little sticky something right here no it's in the word of God the seed is a word of God the seed is not something that's like a seed you plant in the ground and it's definitely not like sperm in reproduction anybody with me okay so we come here and we have either Faith or doubt now you can either have the holy of holies or you can have the Hades of holy one of the things but you're born with a nature Fallen nature Fallen nature okay there's a there's there's an adamic nature attached to you that when you get to the age of accountability listen when you get to the age of accountability that's when God records and thank God that he sent us a prophet that told us that all babies go to heaven and if you're if you're eight nine ten years old or somewhere in there and you pass away then guess what you go to heaven you're not bribed because you can't clean this up like the Holy Ghost can but thank God he can cover you by the blood of Jesus Christ and give you eternal life but now not here though you'll be given eternal life at the white Throne judgment everybody all right okay so now but let's say let's say now we have come to a place that we have been uh Luke verse whatever it is Luke 4 or whatever it is where it says the unclean Spirit goes out so remember the unclean spirit I like where you got these little holes right here the unclean Spirit goes out walks and dry places listen you're not dead you're still the same person but boy you sure think different your nature should be becoming a little bit different there's something in here that's what this being there's something being taught you there's something being you know the devil hates the word of God so if you'll start putting the word of God in here it drives that unclean Spirit out come on somebody you guys you got to really want that thing to be gone and not just go oh I wish oh I wish no start giving it the word of God go to church start cleaning up find the right people you know what if you if you go if you're in the right form of sanctification you'll find the right people you'll not be with the same people because birds of a feather white flock together so now let's say that the unclean spirit's gone out now if if you're if you're going to allow it by it you're gonna allow it right through back in you're gonna be worse seven times worth the Bible says you're going to be really religious and Satan's just going to do what he's going to just make you religious all the way out to here am I correct but if you get born again in here that's the fire of God that's your soul that's your Center being that's your heart you've been given a new heart remember brother Brown said it the first what is what does God do he softens you up he gives you a new spirit but it's not the Holy Spirit but let me but let me let me restate what he says it's not a devil spirit it is the holy spirit it's a peace of the Holy Spirit showing you that this can be gone we can lock this in and he can stay there and reside not just come down on you and anoint you because that's anointed ones what is Anointed ones false hear true listen to me true here gifts of the Spirit are here they're not here this is one gift Acts 2 38 and you shall receive what the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the one we want more than anything we want the gift of the Holy Ghost he's going to give it to us drive the unclean Spirit out and seal the thing up so Satan can't get in and God can't even get out but you know what he's doing he's he's trying to work because you still got the spirit man to work with so now as the unclean spirit's gone out of this man we don't have to worry about this man being unclean anymore we have to worry about this one because this is your Battleground now and why is it a Battleground this is now fighting this when you were not born again this all was devil this all was devil so the devil ain't gonna fight himself but when you put the Holy Ghost in here that's his one sworn enemy Satan has no other enemy but God you're not Satan's enemy God is Satan's enemy and vice versa you're not God's enemy Satan is God's enemy but if you keep him inside here you become an enemy of God that's what the Bible says so now the unclean spirit's gone out walks in dry Place seeks rest finest none comes back and sees the house swept and garnished and unless you fill it back up with the Holy Ghost you got to be filled with something you can't be wishy-washy you can't be half that's why brother Brown said Faith or doubt not faith and doubt anybody with me Faith or doubt all right so that's in your soul that's the center realm listen that is what's going to be judged your body is not going to be judged your spirit's not going to be judged the soul of man is what's going to be judged at the white Throne judgment The Souls of man the Bible says will have to give an account and praise God you know what if we get the soul of God inside of us it's already given account it's already cleaned and set aside for sure it's already done that's why brother Brown could say we're The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ it transforming you into what a new creation a new person the old done away behold all things become new but we still live in this world of this guy right here the spirit man which is I say memory reason conscious affectionate imagination that's now has become the Battleground and that part is where we've got to get that unclean Spirit drove out of that part anybody with me all right so it's not just one and done praise God I got born again now you're just going to take the baby and throw it in the closet no you got to feed it and you gotta feed it what the word of God now not the other junk of the world we feed it the word of God and that's what we're doing now going up the statue of perfect man there's as brother Ryan tells his sister Shepherd's dream that there's rocks and sticks all right look it and and he said well sister Shepard was asking was she born again he said yes you're born again in other words he was telling her don't worry about that part which is right here but she was standing in what five streams of water that was flowing out of her person not here here come on not here here and showing her that she was born again but she still had what sticks and rocks that's what we're talking about we're not talking about sanctification Lord clean me up so I can be born again I hope that if you're going up the statue of perfect man you have to get past that Clyde spent so much time on the foundation you got to be born again without even because look if you're not born again every one of these will fool you also don't worry about these right here these are just Outlets to let this work out everybody with me all right but right here's what we got to worry about this imagination conscious memory reason and affection which is the Battleground Satan's going this way trying to fight get back in God's trying to fight to get out that's why we're brother Wayne was talking about grave clothes listen we're resurrected sitting in Heavenly places right here hey man but we still got grave clothes on I hope can I tap that is that going to break it or I can't see Joe I hope he's not going I don't touch that because every time I tap it it makes a difference it looks a little color right here I'm sorry so anyway so you got this right here you got the holy of holies if you're born again you don't have to worry about that let that work its way out a new creation let that unclean Spirit go out of that part of you and let what let God now start okay circumcising not your soul circumcising the next part the memory reason conscious affection you remember probably not going to get to the rest of this but we're going to go this way you remember the children of Israel they came out of Egypt right they journeyed in the wilderness of what sin okay right they come over they come out then they got to Jordan right they're by with me they got to Jordan when they crossed over that was their new birth they crossed over washed their old past away everybody with me but remember when they stepped into that new land as brother Wayne was talking about the old corn of the land they ate not that Mana anymore but also they were what circumcised circumcised means the baptism of the Holy Ghost now why do you need two fillings in type they came out they went through the Wilderness Sanctified you know what he'd done he got rid of all them old Fighters and remember there was two people left Joshua and Caleb all right then they get to the promised land and God says hold on a man we got another little thing we got to do here y'all uh y'all made it through the Wilderness just fine but now you're into what Promised Land now you're in the promised land now the old corn of the land which is what mature come on people do not get that one of these they they're not eating Manna God is going to feed you but there's a day when God's going to say there's corn in this land that's now mature you don't eat corn in the stock you don't eat corn when it's about that big make you sick as a dog but you can eat corn when it's on when it's got fully matured ears you can shuck that baby back and eat it all day long but what has it done it's matured and when you eat mature you become mature you are truly we are what we eat not just this we are what we eat in the gospel and the world and all the different things everybody with me on this so your soul if it's born again tonight it is trying its best to work its way out into the imagination conscious memories and affection the Little Devils so now unclean Spirit goes out of what goes out of now in our spirit Realm remember the old Indian had no problem when he was when he not born again like he said he said Chief now has two dogs okay when you were not born again when you were out in the world you were a dog from here to there and everything in between but when you got the Holy Ghost you had so much of an of a nature of this world till it's all got to be contrary to the devil the devil is contrary to everything that you are now and when you go up to the Statue of perfect man it's going to be even more that you're going to have to fight for every inch of ground greatest battle ever fought it's not in your soul if you're born again that battle is over step into the Promised Land and take what's yours which is what these promises of Faith virtue and all his temper's patience godliness and brotherly kindness a kind of uh got a chance to talk to brother Wayne about that and he may be watching in I don't know but still I told him I said you know you realize facing on an ad and he just looked at me kind of strange he kind of said I said show me the Bible where it says add to your face faith is a new birth because listen there's only seven ads we've been through this don't look at me crazy for those new ones maybe you can look at me a little crazy but look if you take and keep Faith here one two three four five six seven eight there's not eight ads there's seven add to your new birth one two three four five six seven that makes it right it's my faith now add to my faith virtue so maybe we can say a few things maybe that don't think we I'm not very smart around here sometimes we can confound the wise by just little things you say but it's it's terminology but it's the truth though because Faith's not an ad you add to your faith you add to your new birth your new birth listen if you get born again and never go up that pyramid you still gonna have little small nuggets of that cholesterol inside of you everything you need for your journey what the prophet say is right here all right you've just gotta do what let it out have you ever heard that before let it out so what about all these virtues watch neither did the poll have any virtue in it not a bit in other words this word has no virtue in it if you make it of none effect you by your Traditions make this what Paul said what the letter killeth but the spirit give his life but it was obeying what God Said do is what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God so if you're not born again tonight no one thinks for sure you're lost now you can be in a journey of justification and sanctification don't stop don't keep going because you know what that unclean spirit that comes out of you is going to walk back walk back in so bad because he was comfortable there everybody with me on this it was comfortable for me to go to a bar I didn't go to many but I did sorry it was BC but you know why because that's what was pulling me inside was that thing inside of me that did not want to do right I didn't want to come to church maybe I'm the only one I didn't want to that inside of me didn't want to but one day the seed word that was in the mind of God found me and said hey I've had enough for you and I hope you've had enough of him the devil and I did I said Lord I've had enough of this tired of running if you've never experienced that you need to and man you need to experience that we sing the song the things I do I do no more and all that it's a it's a it's a For Real Thing the things I used to do I don't do them anymore first Samuel 15 says Samuel was talking about um Saul says that the Lord is great delight and burn offerings and sacrifices it doesn't obeying the voice of the Lord there's a lot of people and I'll read you a quote probably Sunday brother Brian said there's a lot of people in the world natural people they have part of these virtues but they're not god-given they're nature given you you've seen people there's some people in the world that you work with or you're acquainted with or even if you're friends with that you could slap them and knock them over into into a wall and they just say thank you buddy especially if y'all been drinking together but you they certain people you don't touch and you know that right you don't even look in their Direction well that's just people and nature but if you'll get both unborn again where's the ups and downs it's not there anymore so behold the obey is better than sacrifice in other words what are you saying by the way I'm coming back to this because it cost Saul his kingdom it costs saw the Kingdom of Israel whether he wasn't supposed to be king or not he was King the people made him a king and God accepted it at the moment but he said Saul the kingdom been rent from you just because of one thing you didn't obey what your Prophet said oh come on somebody you didn't you didn't do what your Prophet said your Prophet said Kill Them All obey is better than sacrifice to hearken than the fat of realms oh listen read in your Bible Saul preached a pretty good sermon hey we saved this King so we can maybe convert him and we saved all these Rams so we can sacrifice them to the Lord that didn't mean one thing to God because he had said something through the prophet and he didn't do it so it didn't matter about that for Rebellion as as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry that's pretty rough the brother mom tells us we're not building an organization not here this morning building an organization we're not trying to build an organization here we're trying to build individuals Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the what the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his words he built up the individual to that place and it all starts with virtue the whole multitude started to touch him why they want to touch him why didn't they want to teach a touch a Roman soldier why didn't they want to touch Caiaphas you ever thought about that catfish was the man of the hour Caiaphas was their preacher Tapas was their pastor they relied on Caiaphas to go once a year behind the holy of holies and not die self and to give what to give a sacrifice for the whole country of Israel they depended on him but did they go right into him when they needed something that's what made him mad that's what made Compass mad they run right by Caiaphas to get to Jesus and that what righteous indignation because his soul was black as such but he kept every ordinance heaven and waving and cutting and chopping and killing this one and and taking this one you know and taking the blood and going behind the the holy of holy seems like he lived a pretty good life but in the end he turned the word down because where was the word in flesh Jesus said you would have had a cloak if I hadn't to come in other words you would have had the Old Testament as long as you didn't touch a woman you didn't commit adultery with her right that was what the Old Testament didn't say about looking or or thinking but Jesus said now I say unto you that if you look on a woman to lust after in your heart you've committed adultery with her already and they didn't like that because they had been doing it all their life virtue anyone knows that the word virtue means what we must have and we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church now where's that virtue going to come from that Center that Center person the central realm all right because you know what that's God in there brother Robert said you and God is persons the only two times he used the word vulcanized was two times I think in the whole um 1100 something sermons but it was very profound because what is vulcanization Jonas you don't know what that is do you buddy he when Jonas don't understand something his eyebrows go together and that's okay because when we had bicycles yeah we had bicycles that we fixed we didn't take them to a bike town and have them fix it for us everybody with me on that hey man we put our own handlebars on it we put our own we put our own patches on patches but what is vulcanization is taking something that's rubber and taking a rubber tube and if there's a hole in it she's riding down a dirt road and right at the if you hit a rock just right in the side we all know this those of us are Road Bicycles it would puncture that tube and just knock a little hole in it and down it went well Dad would go and he'd go up to the store and he'd buy a little patch kit or you know what sometimes if he could find the glue he made his own patch out of what another piece of rubber so that word vulcanization means that you take two pieces you take Rubber and rubber and what you would do would you did you just didn't just you'd clean it off don't you look don't you clean it off real good kind of score it a little bit because what you were going to do was take a same piece of rubber and try to get it to stick on there so the air wouldn't come out of it well what you did you didn't just depend on the glue come on somebody this is good I hope this helps it's not just the glue that we depend on that glue may be a spot dad used to take that man he just brushing on I thought that thing will never never leak again but he takes it out of his pocket or he goes in the house and gets him a gets him a lighter or gets him a match and he and he hits that thing and when he hits it it starts flaming it gets that rubber just hot enough right before it melts all down to nothing and he slaps that other patch on it what'd it do it made both of them patches one of the patch in the tube it made it one come on somebody same way with me and you I and my father are one one pack Hey listen listen stop but listen if God himself patched us up it's rubber to rubber tough crowd on Wednesday night y'all need sleeping about an hour or two before you come to church foreign virtue in his church what rubber to rubber but now see Jonas you couldn't took a piece of wood could have took a piece of wood in a tire tube that's rubber you that whatever you did it didn't matter that would not stick together but if you took and vulcanized and heated up this Rubber and heated up this Rubber and put enough glue around it and you slapped it on there when it cooled off you could not pull that patch off y'all remember you can't pull the patch off and that's why I want him when I was going down the road about 20 miles an hour on the bicycle I didn't want another hole in my tire in the in life I didn't want to go down the road of life and then all of a sudden have a flat but if you vulcanize to the right person and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to a people and what is virtue virtue is strength and power remember we read the quote the other day where brother Brown said we got to have virtue for the whole world this whole world today I declare to you today 2023 January the fourth this world is only held together by the bride it is not held together by gold it is not held together by Putin it is not held together by that other guy we have and it's not held together by none of that it's not held together by economy it's held together by the Bride of Jesus Christ still being here to come to maturity listen the plan as brother Wayne was talking about the chief wave we haven't all come to maturity yet there's some that maybe have but you're not going to go out there just because one comes to maturity and just cut the whole field down you wait it's showing that someone has come to maturity but he's waiting on the whole field to what well as we say in in in in our terminology of Garner waiting for it to head out because when it heads out it makes the same seed as you put in the ground amen and that you know what brother Brown said we're not to shut we're not to stalk we're not the tassel we're the seed where what was winning the ground what and the only seed is Jesus Christ it's not me and you we were born by corruptable seed but by the transforming Power by vulcanization he took that old nature that old sea that you were animated wheat germ out of it I read that quote in just a minute before you can forget about virtue you have to have it so add that to your faith virtue understand remember she didn't touch him physically talking about the woman who touched His Garment she touched His Garment but she pulled out what she needed listen she may have needed some money because for 12 years she couldn't work for 12 years she couldn't go anywhere she was totally unclean if your sisters know what I'm talking about in the Old Testament if you if you were on your monthly cycle you were unclean you couldn't be touched your husband couldn't touch you you couldn't go into Market you couldn't go into this Temple for sure then when you were took the cleansing of the seven days later you could go and you know your natural life will continue on but this lady had been 12 years every day she was probably anemic probably couldn't hardly walk because of her blood loss but she pulled one thing she needed to be healed she didn't need a new car she didn't need a new leg she didn't need for the Lord to give her extra money she needed that blood to stop so whatever issue you have asked the Lord to stop it touch His Garment one time and let's see if we can get all this stuff stopped and get everything pulled back into the right direction because the word pull rin tear perform carry out look to draw the supporter attention of that's why attract the third pull brother around the three poles was what to attract the attention of the people and what were the three poles one was the what in the hand watch this pull my pull the chart back up here please if I don't get any further than this that's okay we got next Sunday pull my chart back up please because Bob preached on this a long time ago and so did I about the three pulls of your journey and it's in that if you can see it and all that and all that going on you got the third pole second pull first pull what was the first pull foreign here see see this see this if there's no bumps you're healed he'd say look lady you still got that then he'll talk to us about five more minutes and then he'll say oh look lady it's gone flesh you can see it but now what was the next pull the second pull was what discernment pulled out of you what you were here and the third poll was when he looked right down in the opening of the word because you know what there was a lot of people got healed in the spirit realm that didn't get healed in the soul you know brother brown one time he's talking one he said oh I see you're a Christian so you know what that inside person was comfortable with him but he then there would be another one walk up and he'd say oh you've got uh capturing your lung he said but if you'll quit smoking and give your heart to God now what was he looking at he wasn't looking in these two Realms right here he was looking right there he was in that guy's throne room he was saying you need the new birth he said if you'll go confess your sins to God he said you'll get better discernment pulled out the virtues sanctification what was he doing he was literally if he was brother Danny if he would have stayed here another 50 years he'd have cleaned the world up think about it 25 000 outstanding miracles in one service one service if he'd still be living today it'd be 100 something years old but think about if he stayed here what kind of an impact he would have had on the whole world they'd have to do away with the medical field what was he doing he was cleaning them up so that he could what preach to their soul so that third pull is what the opening of the word the opening of the word is not here the opening of the word is here look word revealed yeah you can get pieces as the foolish version will get pieces of Revelation but never have God in their Throne Room they've never come to the son of man Revelation or the opening of the word so you got your hand discernment and then you've got the inner Court the opening of the word there's only one place listen brother Branham had to come to a place before he could open the word to us Revelations 5 the book was closed Revelations 10 the book was open there had to be a place to where that book opened up everybody all right then he's talking about the disciples about how turning our hearts back to the face of the fathers if you want to know how to act read the book of Acts that's what that means acts of the apostle how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all of these qualifications all right so that we talk about us being a special group of people and how that we're prophetic people and how that we're an open book people they weren't they didn't have the seals open to them they didn't know when he said I'm the son of man they didn't know who he was they knew he was the son of God they knew he was God and that had come down somehow in some form but he they didn't have a son of man revelation but yet they had what are you saying by the way you can have these virtues and not have the son of man Revelation so that's the Son of God brother Wayne was touched you know that's the Son of God Revelation down through the church age it's not son of man Son of God was trying to get us back to the verses what faith of the fathers that'd be all right and the first little knot of God compared with every bit of this and with his word they knowed it was the word of God listen they didn't even have a Bible they were writing it as they were talking they were a living breathing word of God you and I need to get back to a living breathing word of God they knowed it was the word of God and nothing when God spoke they went they were taught by the word himself then we're talking about we'll just kind of skip through this I want to cover this again next week about the horse riders let's just get through that for time was 20 after eight uh and he talks about latest what we just been talking about in Revelations 2 verse 4 he's talking about the Ephesian churches he said I have somewhat against him because thou has left thy first love I mean the first three ages man that it was powerful in the first there was no denominational idea there was no we think Jesus might be God we think we need to baptize father son Holy Ghost no they knew how to baptize they knew that God in Christ were one but serenthius and all the different ones started coming in saying well maybe he's like substance he can't be all of God we saw him throw up one day he was sick he fell and broke his leg broke his leg but failing skin his knee that can't be God and then that what that steamrolled remember therefore from Wednesday our fallen and repent and do the first works that's what brother Brandon was trying to get us to do get back to the first works all right or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove your Candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou has that thou hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate which is that what tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he didn't have to nearly let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to him that overcometh so it's got to be an overcoming with the true power of God because we know we're going to look at a false power Sunday because we have the knowledge of Good and Evil we have the tree of life we have two trees all right let's look at this just for a moment now remember we're going to interpolate a little bit in just for a few minutes proverbs 31 10. I told you before uh historians if you go back and read in the history this is Solomon right in Proverbs right and he's writing about his mama Bathsheba who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies now here's a man that was a multi in in today's money he was a multi he was in the trillions of dollars that he owned Solomon was trillions of dollars he had gold he just had to throw away but he said a virtuous woman it's way way past that a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband who's our husband I got a husband you've got a husband it's Jesus Christ and we're we're not only going to Crown Him king of kings and Lord of lords we are his crown brother Bob said we're his victory without us who's going to prove the resurrection the devil no no the devil got into them got into Caiaphas and them said oh hey took his body out and throwed it somewhere and and you know they they stole his body and then they ate him because he said eat my flesh and drink my blood but a virtuous woman a virtuous bride let's put that in there The Virtuous bride of Christ is a crown to her husband but she didn't maketh ashamed of those rottenness in his bones that's a denominational world they make God ashamed people they make me ashamed by the way they walk into their churches by the way they treat their churches they treat them just like brother Brown said they're lodges that's the way they treat them they treat it just like a meat and joint for you go to and and and be able to talk about first one thing or another and then sit down for a few minutes and listen to a preacher I had my cousin today Terry Dale I'm calling his name because he's probably he said he was going to be here Sunday but he's a singer and uh he said he was going to come and I told him I said he said what time y'all start I said I'm 45. preaching I said no we have Bible study or our Sunday school class he said when's preaching start I said well about 10 20 I mean 10 40. we start preaching he said what time do you get finished I said ah about 12. earned 20 minutes I said yeah and I could go further than that hour and 20 minutes he said well I think I'll just come he said now what he's our cousin you can pick your friends but you can't pick your family um he said well he said well what if I come in at 11. how much am I going to miss of your sermon that's their mentality they only want a certain amount and that's it the only one that's certain they're only going to get their little 20-minute feel good service and then how long do y'all sing he says because he's a singer I said well now we start singing about 10 15 he said I'd like to hear y'all sing I said well you're gonna have to endure for about two hours then from 10 15 to 12. I said because I preach after that he said I'd like to hear you singing see what I mean they've diverted everything away from the word of God to their own pleasure pleasure me but don't pleasure me but about 20 minutes they said three hours and watch a football game and never move well they move all right yeah they move that's for sure so let's read this right here just real quick and then we'll close a virtuous woman the bride of Christ may I interpolate that because this is not the Bible this is come from the internet so I'm not I'm not desecrating the word of God I'm not adding to it or taking from it I'm telling I'm telling you this is the story I get from this statement a virtuous woman the bride of Christ cares for her family family she is a hard worker this bride of Jesus Christ while she toils Faithfully in meeting the needs of her own family she also doesn't forget to help the other needy people God sends to Nicaragua are the Philippines or Jamaica or Ireland or India a virtuous woman also takes the time to look after her own health hmm and be a good Steward of her body I'm pointing back here that's you that's not listen folks look this is not the congregation I just read you the quote it's individuals this is you or not you it's not you and your wife it's not you and your kids it's not you and your pastor it's you so a virtuous woman takes time to look after her own health I read my own Bible I don't depend on Bob to read the Bible for me of course some of y'all probably do you come to church on Sunday and you haven't read the Bible all week and you expect us to give you something well I'll preach anyhow so our virtuous bride of Christ meaning applies to the heart and then to every area of life memory reason conscious effects of imagination the bottom line is a virtuous woman the Bride of Jesus Christ goes in the strength of the Lord and Faithfully completes whatever task God has for her to do when a person is described as having virtue it is seen as a quality that sets one apart from everyone else look in character strength and morality people look at the morals of this world like I said before think about it when we get to Glory there's not gonna be cheaters there it's not gonna be any Liars there you know what they will be though there will be an economy there'll be rulers Kings there'll be Governors the Bible says the government will be on his shoulder but it won't be this messed up government we got now we're the only people that have any sort of morality it's just Katie bar the door right there folks it is a common characteristic look common characteristic that can be found within the mindset of several women in the Bible from Ruth to Esther to Mary as well as described of others through countless virtues verses The Virtuous person exhibits The Joint Excellence of reason and of character all right The Virtuous person The Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ not only knows what the good thing to do is we've been taught what's good if you've got the new birth you will do what's good in your soul but now you might let that second guy remember the little thing that sits on your shoulder called the devil he don't leave when you get the new birth no he brings another friend and he sits on this side you look at me funny I'm the only one that has these problems I'm sometimes I just wonder y'all look at me like what are you talking about we're preachers but we're people and he's got his gun pointed on us before y'all sometimes because he knows what I'm going to preach before y'all do he feels the anointing he fails to pull The Virtuous bride of Christ not only knows what the good thing to do is he or she is emotionally attached some of y'all ought to be emotionally attached preach it brother go go that's what the world says can't we go we got gold Pride [Applause] all right musicians get ready to come on predestination looks back to foreknowledge I mean election election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to Destiny when we get finished with this I'm gonna probably cover a little bit on predestination but it's very very simple if you'll understand predestination is very simple it just gets convoluted by other people remember the Common People heard him gladly it was the wise that was confounded but the ones that were wise in our own conceit were confounded and their own conceit don't forget that election looks back here here it is I was a kookaburra now how you gonna take this quote and make it match all the other quotes you got to understand what he's talking about yeah I was a cucumber in my throne room was the life of a kookaburra not wheat or when I sprang out out of produced wheat I didn't produce wheat I was a cucumber have you ever walked through the woods some of y'all ought to get out and walk through the woods and talk to God he's out there but you get these stains on your legs we used to call them well we come back alive it's actually beggar lives but we forget all the mother ours and E's and call it bigger lights right then yeah but big Elias had little things on it you know and that when you walk through and they'd just stick all over you we've had to walk too many times me and Dad went through we were somewhere hunting one time we got down finished and we got down to the car and from here down was nothing but that and some Kookaburras we had to take our knife and scrape that stuff off praise God we got it all scraped off I hope somebody's getting this thank God we got it all scraped off but the kookaburrence what we were and a kookaburra is not just one it's a bush of them you don't get just one color you get bunches I was a kookaburra what and you know what them things hurt if things hurt when you get them in the wrong place back your leg rear end and all that other stuff don't sit out on one well that's what it is in sand people that's exactly the way we were we were totally uncomfortable I was a kookaburra I was born in sin come on a musician I was shaping iniquity came to this world speaking lies born amongst Sinners this is the prophet telling us what he was I was a huckleber but all of a sudden may I interpolate by the transforming power of the Holy Ghost I became a weak grain now it didn't change the outside it still looked like a cucumber how did it happen what is it election God before the foundation of the world elected that that cuckoo were kookabur was to become a grain of wheat now I know I'm a grain of weed because I'm saved how do I do it look back and see that what he predestinated it not down here there thank God long time ago by foreknowledge he's saying that I would love him so he made a perpetuation what a way he made a way that he could break that cuckleberry open praise God and put weed life down in there and lock it back up but you know what if you plant it what is it going to bring wait because it's a life of the wheat inside you might have been born in sin born from your mom and daddy don't know who your mom and daddy is but I promise you you get baptized with the Holy Ghost you'll bring forth wheat life no more kookaburra but now listen we're gonna have a sticky nature because remember that outside shell is still a kookaburra hello somebody brother Brown said this thing's going to be sticky to the change that's why we're trying our best to get through this statue of perfect man so that we'll have the knowledge of God not the knowledge of the world okay let's stand to our feet he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him I might because he looked through him not what that preacher did but through him through his own son that through him I might become from a kookaburra to a grain of wheat now where am I at where am I at I'm saved I'm walking in The Graces of God what does predestination look to Destiny where will he take me to and where am I going that's got you there you are let's read this real quick your first husband that you were married to the world that middle part the anointed bridegroom Jesus Christ which foreign you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church congregation says no that don't sound right does it you might find that in Almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word in the word see you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message it was a Thanksgiving message actually in Shreveport Louisiana as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen some of y'all ought to try that every jot every kettle where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them sharks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the s-o-n I hear the coming of the combine you're standing completely Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than in other words turkey and dressing you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God in what and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ stands as though you never sinned in the first place you are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ let's be glad rador wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is a righteousness wait a minute that's that say the righteousness of God no I don't see that in here do you I got this I caught I copied and pasted it right out of the Bible and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and finally in a clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of you not the Saints before the righteousness of you you have become righteous and now I want us to talk we're going to talk about knowledge Sunday I want you to know that knowledge is knowing brother Brown said knowing how to handle the word of God knowing what's right and what's wrong knowing when a false Doctrine is being preached let me read this one thing right here look at this knowledge signifies in general intelligence watch the general
