========================================

all these things in life that you go through that when you prayer when you go to in prayer that there's a God that answers back we're not just worshiping in vain that we're not just coming to a building to warm the seats and so forth but there's a god that actually is is is alive and on the scene and he's not just a historical God but he's the same God that he was back then he's still the same God now we've got the videos and the pictures of things that that Supernatural lights that you know that that were expressed in brother bram's life and whatnot but yet that same Pillar of Fire if you go really study it out that same Pillar of Fire is with the bride today it's not just on the wall it's it's actually here in the building because he's still the same yesterday today and forever so you see as that just flows right in from remember them which have the rule over you and we studied it out it's not just a man telling you what to do or how to dress yourself or how to clothe yourself and how to cut whether to cut your hair not cut your hair and all those things but it's the word of God that's claiming your life that when it grabs a hold of you it's doing something in you and it's causing you to react to that to that unseen Force the the the god of the universe that he's actually having an effect on you and you start believing him you believe him and when you believe him something happens now there's there's when you really you really begin to understand that he's the same yesterday today and forever when you know that there's a God that's going to answer back when you pray you you're believing not just Ju Just just throwing your words out when you when you get on your knees and pray but you believe that God is going to hear your prayer and answer back now that ties in with uh with Matthew 24:35 that says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away that means all the Earth might Rumble in an earthquake and and fall to the ground God might take everything away from you like job did and and but yet uh like I love that scripture in job will Satan said will will job serve me for not and the answer is yes yes I will serve God if everything's taken away that's right you you can say that same confession like job did I'll serve him if I don't have nothing cuz listen when everything's taken away when all of Heaven every no no more Heaven and Earth if it was all passed away God's words will never pass away now that's see that's having confidence that he's the same yesterday today and forever that we're believing in an unchanging God that's still present today so now brother Brandon when he explained that scripture that I just read Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away he he used the example in in that message uh why it had to be Shepherds of Moses there with the serpent that he threw down in front of pharaoh the the staff that he uh tossed down in front of pharaoh let's just read that story real quick in Exodus 7:8 it says and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show a miracle for you then Thou shalt say unto Aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and Moses and Aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the Lord had commanded and Aaron cast down his Rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then Pharaoh also caused the wise men and the sorcerers Now The Magicians of Egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments well they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but Aaron's Rod swallowed up their rod their rods now I I I grabbed that little screenshot of the the scene from that Ten Commandments movie of the of them of them acting this out now you think about though that they're acting out they're acting out a story that you and I are going to live through you you find out as you go through life that these stories become real because I'm I'm living through that you know you're going through it you look you can look back and be reminded of these things and oh think about what's happening now that that Moses he's he's God told him what to do right Aaron throws down his rod and and then then something unexpected happens what here come some fakers and they throw down their rods too and it looks like they're doing the same thing now what now there's the question now what are you going to believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever are you going to try to put your hand in it and force the issue try to do something try to come up with your own way of doing it are you going to step back and let God go to work now they th here's the two the two uh Janice and jambers throwing theirs down put yourself in MO in Moses and Aaron's shoes if you were in their spot what would you do would you panic maybe maybe you're going through a situation in life right now what are you going going to do Panic is God's word true is he the same yesterday today and forever that's what it means that's what I'm talking about he's the same he's still the same it doesn't matter if if the devil throws something unexpected in your path something unexpected happens sit back and wait amen faith is what I'm talking about remember them that have the rule over you because they give you the word to build up your faith to believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever so when something like this happens you can stand in confidence believing amen that God is still on the scene now think about all the things Moses could have done Moses and Aaron could have reached out and grabbed the other snakes I'm impatient I'm I guess we're going to have to do this another way reach out and grab this grab the snake and let's let's try to picked up Aaron staff they could have tried to prematurely tried to negotiate with Pho through their natural abilities or persuasion well if God won't come on the scene I'm just going to have to try to use my my natural wisdom and try to just try I'm going try to have to talk him into it sought out other ways to convince the Israelites of their mission or to pressure Pharaoh into letting the Israelites go they could have tried to act independently of God's will which would have threatened their Divine favor with God now see as Christians we're relying totally on God where God is our everything you you go back through all these stories in the Old Testament and the New Testament and it's not by anything that man does it's not by your own works of righteousness it's not by anything that you do it's uh we'll find out even in a minute when you're trying to talk to your children to witness to them it's not really anything that you do can do you're you're totally relying on your faith in God to go to work right when you step back like Moses and Aaron did and say well God you're going to have to do something right cuz I can't do it and then that's when you see God go to work when you when you don't have nothing to do in it then you can have confidence that it is God that God is doing something am they could have impatiently acted on their own which would have undermined their leadership then would all the all the Israelites would have been what's going on you said you said such and such and it didn't come to pass and you jumped the gun and had Aaron and Moses not waited for God to move their mission could have faced premature faith due to a lack of divine endorsement miraculous signs and the authority they needed to lead the Israelites out of out of Egypt but they waited yes they just waited amen just sit back and wait on God now there's a lesson no matter what situation we're in you come to you come to a place where and that's what the whole Christian journey is self sacrifice you'll find out you know even Jesus said that that Judas he he thought that Jesus could get himself out of that predicament right he he sold Jesus for 30 pieces of silver and he thought that well Jesus he's extricated himself out of these predicaments before he'll get himself out of this one but he didn't realize that Jesus was going to die death self- sacrifice is the it's like the the essence of the Christian Journey that's where Peter got hung up when when when uh when Jesus was talking to him and he said Peter Peter was arguing with him about going to the cross and and Jesus said uh get thee behind me Satan because he was speaking contrary contrary to the will of God which was to die and and you and I have to die too we've got to die to our own will that's what that's really what prayer is when you get along with God and you're laying yourself down on the altar of sacrifice and you're saying God not my will just like in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus was saying father not my will not my will but thine be done you're laying everything down and saying God you you got to take control you got to work things out I I it's past my ability it's past my understanding you've got to move on the scene just like Moses and Aaron now there there's the there's the essence of he's the same yesterday today and forever I I want to ask you maybe this morning do do you do you believe that do you I mean this not just something that we quote but when you go out of this building today are you going to are these words going to really echo in your heart that when you come into situation like Moses and Aaron are are are are here getting confronted with with with the devil's reaction what are you going to do are you going to believe what God Said or are you going to put your own will to it are you going to put your hand to it try to try to try to solve the situation yourself or trust in a living God and why it had to be Shepherd brother BR said that staff itself had turned into a serpent before pharaoh and the same Pharaoh tried to mimic by magicians and so does the modern pharaohs of today amen and make Believers carnal impersonators of the message try to mimic the same thing without knowing where it's coming from and throw it into some denomination or something when it's as free from it as the air is from being pinned up sure but try to mimic make a mimic but notice this same Shepherd staff eat up the other snakes where was them snakes said they were rods on the floor and there was only only one rod picked up both heavens and earth shall pass away said Jesus but my word shall not that something to think about you you whatever your problem is if you trust in God you'll find out like like Moses and Aaron did the problems were gone when they picked that that Rod up they were gone because they trusted in God they got swallowed up in Victory because his word will not fail he's he's still the same am he's still the same that he always was now now now let's think about that theme as we're going through the scripture that it's not us it's not our own abilities it's not our ability to kind of to and exodus 14:14 it says the Lord shall fight for you yes and you shall hold your peace amen it's the Lord now there's the Christ a Christian way is to step back and step back and believe and watch God do it watch God go to work amen I and I I love to watch God go to work there's so many times you so I could I could start going through all the experiences in my life and it sound like I'm being boastful but I've seen God work so many times when you get you get down in your prayer closet and you you see maybe your kids doing something they shouldn't get down and the next morning the situation will be changed because and you didn't have nothing to do with it your hands are off of it but God came God went to work and began to move and something happened and why because he's still the same he's still the same that he always was now look I know this is really hard to read but I'm just going to quickly relat some of these stories Moses and The Parting of the Red Sea how's Moses going to part the Red Sea they just him and the Israelites watched as God parted it the fall of Jericho they just marched around they marched around and and shouted at the end of the of of the March but but it was God that caused the walls to come down and Joshua and the versus the amalekites when they held up moses' hands as long as they held up moses' hand what what why should that have an impact on the victory am because Christ his hands were held up on the cross and he died for us he he's the one that paid the price on the cross and Moses there was EXA typifying what Christ would one day do for us on the cross as his hands were held up it see it's not us it's God it's our trust in God to fight the battle when sarib came up again against Hezekiah and and an angel came and and and went down into the camp and defeated all the Assyrians and Hezekiah didn't have nothing to do with it all they did to think that's what the Christian journey is to just watch and sit back and watch and see God go to battle for you what a joy that should be in our lives to have confidence in a living reality of a God that could go to battle for you and you ain't got to do nothing but just have faith in him jehoshaphat's B Victory when when Jehosaphat was told by a prophet of the Lord that the battle was not theirs but it was God's all they had to do was take up their position stand seal and to see the Deliverance the Lord would give him Peter when he got up out of prison the gates opened by themselves and all what what were they doing at home praying they were in their prayer closet praying and sacrificing their will to God and saying Lord we believe you and God went on the scene and and and and wrought a victory for them and all they had to do was believe the fiery furnace when Shadrach mesach and Abednego were thrown in there and they just had confidence that God would come on the scene and he did and Gideon against the midianites Gideon with 300 men 300 men and all he did was just have trust in God and Daniel in the Lion's Den you see because it's it's not it's not by our power it's not by our might but it's the spirit of the Lord that wins the battle that's that scripture in Zechariah 4 you I I put this picture just so we can visualize what Zachariah is saying here when he said an angel come and woke him up and he said and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold hm that sounds familiar with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof at two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof which brother Brown said meant represent the Old and New Testament so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts now what's what gives us our strength is these words that are represented in the old and the New Testament that God is empowering our lives with like like this is a symbol of it's it's his Spirit working in our lives that we're have having confidence in him to do and to work and to deliver in Psalms 37 it says rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him freten not thyself because of him who prosper in his way right because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass just rest in God fear thou not Isaiah 41 for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee y I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness amen now now again what we're talking about is he's the same yesterday today and forever and if we really believe that we'll have that kind of Faith to believe that he's still on the scene in Psalm chapter 62 it says my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved and 1 Peter 5:7 says casting all your care upon him for he carth for you and I like this one 46 the one we've got over the on the ceiling there be still be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the earth isn't that isn't that interesting that a lot of times when you're still when you just stop trying to do something that's when God goes to work God goes to work when you take your hands off the situation God goes work when you when you take a step back and let God do something and questions and answer she said I just went through now I I know I've read this story before but I I want to kind of belabor this cuz this is this is the essence of of of of how a Christian goes to battle with the devil he said I've just went through the experience with my Rebecca see just committed to God just commit it to God that's what we have a we struggle with like we we got to figure it out figure out how to fix things but just just give it to God Amen he said when she got to be a little teeny and she was going with some girl and we first went out there going run over to some girl's house taking piano music lessons and this girl I come by one day and he this girl was sitting there at the piano play and rock and roll well that was just enough for me so I told her stay away from over there see and then she said well this the only place I got to go to take music you know how teenies get and I said every kid has to go through that now that's some encouragement for parents it's that little phase of life when you're like what's going on but practically everyone goes through that age I sure remember when I went through that age and I sure remember when my kids went through that age I I remember when my brother went through that age we all go through that a that little that little period you did I did and we got to think we got to think their thoughts amen so then a few days after that her mother got after her for something and she sashed her now that's not Rebecca at all took off and slammed the door almost and knocked the things off the wall went to school now I ought to have seemingly just taken my belt off that is't that right where our mind goes a lot of times who boy I'm going to do it old school way we going to get a barrel slat and we're going to go to we're going to go to town but look look what he saying put put your thought and think about how they how what they're going through I I just taken my belt off and follow her out there in the yard and brought her back with warps around her se but I thought wait a minute I got to think 18yearold thought thoughts see now I said mother I know that she started crying ma I said now I know you done all you can do now there there's there's Moses and Aaron I know you done all you can do when youve done all you can do no matter what the situation is it's time to trust God I done all I can do now if it's out of our hands we have to take the next step and then she then she started that I took ma about an hour I said ma take your hands off Now isn't that Moses and Aaron take a step back and let God do something I can't do nothing what if I do something it's going to mess everything up if if you take that belt off it's you're going to mess everything up see just it's Moses and Aaron all over again me that's my kid I said isn't it mine too all right I said if she was dying this morning you'd have to commit her to God for her Eternal destination why can't we commit her to God now for her Earthly journey and she said well that's my kid I said I said it's mine too I said now can you take your me not saying nothing to her I said I never said that we'll we'll quit scolding her just advis her why cuz God's going to do something hey you ever notice when you're witness somebody somebody's just really on your heart they start getting upset and maybe they'll get a little ory why cuz something there's a battle taking place you just step back and let God go to work God can do it a whole lot more than we can now look I just put some made some bullets are some of these main points that he saying he said I never said that we'll quit scolding her just advise her and he said she needs a buddy and you're the one to be her buddy you and I we're her parents I said ma take your hands off now that's now see sometimes though let's let's let's balance it out we got to have a standard in our home I want to have a standard in my home but at the same time I want God to be able to go to work that's that's difficult sometimes to articulate right where you you want to have a standard where you you can't come in my house smoking marijuana you can't come in my house you know watching stuff that you're not supposed to do and and all that kind but at the same time we back up enough to let God go to work and God will go to work and questions and anwers he says so there we there got down on our knees and committed it to God I said I know now there's we struggle with that turn it over to God and let God do something I said I know she's 18 years old we'll be in a few days and she and a girl that age will think about boyfriends and we've kept her in I said I never wanted to see her get married I want to put her in the office here do the work I want to see her filled with the spirit and live like that and she well we all wanted that that's our will that's what the things well I I I think she should do this and this right but that there's where we put our hand to it she we all wanted that she she said well we can't do that said said she just won't listen to it I said wait a minute we've raised her all we can now put her in the hands of God commit her and I said then when she does anything say Becky darling mother don't want you to do that but I'm your pile I'll stick by you see let her know that you love her she's going to let get somebody to love her and it might be the wrong woman see I said you be the woman does the loving right I said honey that sounds kind of crude but people come everywhere and set on personal interviews and things I said I'm so common we're common to one another because we're husband and wife but we never let that happen you must remember this is the name of the Lord so let's just commit it to God and God and his people as we close here in the last few minutes he said commited to God believe it step out on it claim God's promise at the end of that story brother Brown was relating that she she ended up God got a hold of her and she ended up changing her changing her ways and and and and and gave herself to the Lord and so forth claim God's promise just commit it to God believe it commit thy ways unto the Lord he will bring it to pass whatever you want and the Church of the Living God he said accept it in a good heart already fertilized in all the creepers and the rocky places and the Stony doubts taken away and in good Rich soul of faith and believe it commit it to God and walk away testifying that you have received what God has promised you in questions and answers 1954 he said when I get these letters and they tell me well you can't do it just yet there's this has to be done and this has to be done then I don't I feel bad facing the people I don't know what to do but one thing I'll do this and you are with me I'm going to commit it to God and say now Lord when you're ready I am now there's the battle to just commit it to God and let God do something with it God bless you now let me let me stop right there and um just make a little quick announcement so we would like to ask for everybody to make sure that the next two Sundays I don't
