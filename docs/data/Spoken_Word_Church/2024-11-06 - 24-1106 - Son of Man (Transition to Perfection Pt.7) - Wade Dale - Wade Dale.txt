party so um we sure appreciate the uh you know I thank the Lord for putting us here if if not then you need to go somewhere else I'm talking about not in this physical place but in this message and giving us an insight and giving us revelation of what's coming and we know what's coming up we know what's going to happen we may not know exactly all the details we may not know the name of the people but we know for a fact that the Antichrist is going to take over all right so it's not going to be the president of the United States we know who it's going to be Prophet told us who it was so um the the the president of the United States is just a puppet just a puppet and whoever pulls the strange you'll never know it but the world will know it one day because he's going to quit hiding and he's going to step out when we get out of here and he's going to say hey I'm the one that's been running this place start worshiping me all this other stuff has got to bow down to the Antichrist but thank God we know one thing for sure the prophet of God said we will not be here so we won't see it we may see the workings of it and the coming of it but we're not going to see the Fulfillment when he walks into that Temple and says that he's God we know where God is he's in his people uh remember that uh this weekend brother Bob be speaking on Sunday a regular service one service um just like normal and uh I'm leaving tomorrow and I'm going to Kentucky for about a week or so and I'll be back on uh Lord willing on Saturday next week um brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night uh remember the church dinners on the 17th remember what sister June you got it down on the on the board everybody just go by and read it it just pretend you're reading it if but you know what to bring won nothing grass nothing with grass in it sister but sisters bring a large dish and we need 10 sisters to do a certain thing you just go down there and read it and uh We've Got U uh we'll have a time of of Fellowship that whole day we'll stay here and and let some of the young kids we got a couple of bouncy houses and and we'll put them up outside and uh let the kids have a time and we'll have a time of fellowship and then we'll have a we should be the most thankful people in the world amen amen like I said before we we could be that group out there that's worried whether this one's a Democrat and this one's a Republican and this one's a this and this one's of that and some people just get all bent out of shape about it but that's all they got to be bent out of shape about I want to be bent out of shape about the word of God Amen if we would be as passionate as they are in their rallies that's right if we would be that passionate about the word of God we would get out of here we would I mean it's just you look at the fervor that they have I mean thousands of people shouting and screaming over a politician wow anyway remember also brother Tim cross will be here on the 24th brother landland will be here the Tuesday the 26th we'll have church service on Tuesday night not Wednesday night on Thanksgiving weekend which is at the very end of the month now so we got a couple of weeks so just keep us all the in prayer we got a a lot going on in December but we'll announce that later on but just remember the church dinner and all that so if you would turn your Bibles we're going back to Malachi like we were this past Sunday I got some real good comments on the Daniel 7 weeks so we may we may break that down again like that and uh and U I know it's U it's it's hard to understand because it's you have to take a Jewish side of it all right right cuz it is to the Jews right but then there's a spiritual application to us yeah and it is a timeline that tells us where the woes are placed and the vows and the plagues and even where the seals come in cuz the seal I mean the seals are to us but as they open what is the Sixth Seal it's a tribulation so it's over there when the Jews get their message and they're fighting and getting out of there and go six seal goes to them and then Christ comes back and gets gets them and takes them in a Rapture so it all intertwines together so U it's just real nice to be able to understand though instead of having a lot of questions thank you I don't have any more questions now so if you want to bring some more we'll have some maybe next week or next month spiritual progress is like a detoxification think about it we detox everything else let's detox some sin let's detox some wrong ideas and wrong living let's and what is that that's a purging we purge when we detoxify we purge and we get rid of all the garbage well let's have a spiritual detoxification that's what the word of God would do it'll clean you out let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for this day you give us we appreciate Lord the people that are here tonight and we pray Lord that you be with the ones that are that couldn't get here Lord that are sick we ask your blessings on them Lord as they watch in Father all the ones on the internet different places father I pray that you'd anoint them Father and just bless them with the word of God as we are sitting here today Lord under this anointing of the Holy Ghost that you'll speak to your people father and that you'll move me out of the way you be the participant in this service Lord and just move on the people move among them and move in them father I pray that you'd bless each one now take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen you know before we read this I want to tell you a little something some of you I know if are watching The Chosen if you hadn't then then you need to um it's a really good uh um it's like brother Jason Watkins said it's it's a human Jesus a lot of the others have made him something so high and mighty till he like dad said he used to think that brother that Jesus was so much God he couldn't stuff his toe well this guy that plays Jesus I mean he's he's real you know he he does a really good job and uh that Dallas Jenkins you know he knows um Neil havala they were they were together for a while so he may know a little bit about the message who knows but you know I was watching last night and and um and U you see the girl that the woman that touched his the Hem of His Garment and you realized it and and and tears were rolling in my eyes as they're beginning to now because that girl we said oh she you know she she had fa she touched the Garment she was made whole I know all you sisters that are here over about 14 years old you know what she was going through but she was not going through that as a monthly cycle it was every day every day there was issue of blood every day for 12 years but not only that let's go back into her life her daddy kicked her out of the house cuz see everything she sat down on was unclean everything she did everything she touched according to the law was unclean she couldn't go in the temple for 12 years she couldn't Worship in that Temple because she was unclean but praise God she met somebody but I never but I never thought why did she say I just let me touch his hem because if she' have touched his skin he'd have been unclean in her mind this is the rabbi this is the one I I want to get to him oh I can't get to him because if I touch him he'll be unclean well she just didn't know who he was but she knew he was different so that was wonderful how she reached under and grabbed that that that blue and white cord that he wore around his waist and she pulled on it and and he said virtue or somebody touched me and then her issue went away what a what a what a powerful thing if you've never I know you've never went through that but my what for 12 years go through something for 12 years every day that you can't even F she couldn't get married she couldn't have no friends if she had that issue everybody that touched her was clean thing she touched was unclean I mean unclean that was horrible that was a horrible 12 years but you know what the whole thought of my the whole process the way I was thinking I said God you allowed that to happen you let her suffer through that for 12 years just to so that she can show people there can be songs written about her right if I could but touch the him of His Garment there sermons been preached her faith Jesus said you're clean oh my when Jesus looked at you and says you're clean what a mighty God we serve when Jesus tells us we're clean we're clean that's why he looked at that pre that that high and mighty preacher standing there the priest and he said she's clean well when she he said she's clean that was it for me you know she was clean so same way with me and you but to have something like that to let her go through that knowing he'd meet the master knowing he knowing she would meet him but letting her go through it for 12 years just to be able to do that and then forever for eternity to be known as the woman that touched the him of His Garment right and the faith he said he said he said this he said I'm Jesus was looking he said I'm just so full of joy she kind of looked at him said because it's your faith it wasn't him it was your faith right amen and he was going you remember he was going to heal jer's he was going to raise jer's daughter from the dead so he had a pretty good journey going through there you know and you know what that same God's here the same God's here to take us and make us clean to clean us up and not be afraid to touch us he wasn't afraid to touch her he you know grabbed her by the hand grabbed her by the face that's it what a mighty God we serve Malachi 4 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud ye all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness rise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as cows of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in wh for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I will send you not the world he's going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children the heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse Revelations 10 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we're here when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word I thought that was so that was so real that that sometimes we just think well you know she just kind of crawled through there and touched His Garment it was a one and done thing she'd been suffering for 12 years suffering alone and all the blood that was that she was losing in her body that her body had to make back up and they didn't have things like iron pills and all kind of stuff that you can take now she was just so drained but you know what she said let me just touch His Garment tonight let's just touch His Garment we can hold Jesus tonight by the new birth you can hold him but let's just try to touch the Hemm of His Garment tonight and be made whole and let virtue and strength come from him what he is the word he's the word of God Amen now Zechariah 4 we were talking about Sunday looking at all these scriptures that are pertaining to us I mean us not as somebody else us it pertains to us the bride in the end time all right so these are like I said this this is not we've not gone back into Bible days Bible days has come here yeah we can't go back we don't want need to go back into Bible days Bible days is coming here cuz what's going to happen I'm going to tell you right here at the very end the end of the sermon brother brandham was prophesying forward he tried and he was trying he was getting those Pentecostals out he was telling them to come out of her my people and as J zerubabel means swn in Babylon so he had to come out of Babylon he had to come out of those Pentecostal churches he wanted to bring the people with him but he was not sent to them right he was sent to a group of people forward yeah cuz to be the final voice of the final age while he was here he was the voice but not the final Voice come on he was the voice of God for our age but he wasn't the final voice the final voice is him through a bride yes I don't say him brother Brandon him Jesus in a bride that's the final voice he told us that he said you're the final voice under your messenger you're the final voice to the final age and I believe that the only voice that God has now is his bride amen sure we have him in taping book for him but Ma you can listen to him all the days of your life and still die and go to hell right that's right but once that voice comes alive in your heart and then it speaks out yeah it comes to a revelation that that that has never been known to man since the since Jesus was here and they literally didn't understand him when he was here you keep watching that movie I mean they're just they all scratch their head they've never seen a man like this never a man they said the Bible never a man never a man spoke like this well I say that same thing with brother randam not a man you'll ever hear in your life will ever speak like that man right but now that voice is in us in a multiplied form in the bride speak speak to the people the people are reacting listen folks the people are going to react to the message of this hour that's right yes sir the bride will react now if you're not bride it's just going to be something that you just it's a ritual amen but it's got to be something real it's got to be something that you can identify with that's what I want you to see from now from here till we get finished with this church age you may say that we are identified with everything that's going on in this church age it's been spoken of us now we're living it and we're going to live but we're living it right now yes right we're walking through the Bible all the prophecies we're walking right through them right now all the Prophecies of the end time as brother Ryan has been feeding me some scriptures and I've been finding some about the end time that's specific to the end time right wow there's a lot of them oh yeah oh yeah Zechariah 4:5 then the angel that taught with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord this is Zachariah this is the Angel talking to him he answered and spake unto him to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain now watch what happens all right who art thou oh great Mountain question right it's what the Angel's asking right before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone Now The Headstone doesn't come down here right sure it's a message that is included but the headstone is up here there has to be a building built before The Headstone can come down on iten right so zerubabel helped us get all the way I say listen to me helped us get all the way to here and then his message will bring the headstone but it will only come through a group of people it will not come through one person anymore amen amen we are headstone people we are thus sayith the Lord people we are the people that the ends of the Earth has come upon we are the people that this examples of all the Old Testament has come to us today amen amen all we ought to be happy I was so happy when I was watching that and I thought Lord how many people really understood what she was going through how many people really understood why she didn't touch you she knew a little something but if I can just touch his just just His Garment just His Garment I believe God placed that in her heart but I believe you may have placed that in many people's heart and they don't do it cuz I believe God spoke to more people than just Abraham but he knew Abraham was the one that would respond cuz God not a respector a person that's why the brother R stood and preached to hundreds of thousands of people and this is all that's left hundreds of thousands of people and this is what's left right right it's me and you a small group brother BR said a small group out of a group I want to be that group out of a group cuz there's two spirit's working in the framework of the church one true one false right don't you think for one thing's for sure that the Antichrist is watching what we're doing oh yeah well we know who he is we know he's a devil but he's watching what we're doing he's imitating he cannot be the original amen you and I are the original that's why I said we're not a type that's it he's trying to type after us Satan's watching us right to see what we're going to do and then he'll make a move so we need to watch and wait be those five wise virgins yes that's who we are if you're bride you're one of you're one of the you're you're your your whole Christian experience is in those five wise virgins right lamp trimming time knowing when to get up knowing when to get oil being a virgin and when he calls you know his voice that's it there's a lot of people don't know his voice they know who he is they know he died on a cross and you know that I was thinking I was thinking last night too as a as a paradox if that poor guy that played Jesus ain't born again but you're not going to say that I'm not going to say that to a bunch of people but but it's important to be born again you can play Jesus all you want to you can play this one or that and the other and all you want to but God don't want that he wants to originality that's it but it is I'm I'm not saying it is really good to watch that cuz he does a super job of making Jesus human winking at people calling Lazarus Laz yeah like gu his Buddy L LZ how you doing buddy then they start playing ball together and of course there's a perfect one standing there and he can't even pick a ball up so that's the God we serve he's hiding in Simplicity right right he came down here to be imperfect so that you and I could be perfect right what a mighty God we serve so he's going to bring forth The Headstone he's going to bring something down that's never been brought before amen and it's here now it's not coming folks it's here now that's right amen that's why I said we're not looking for it the prophecy was made but we're standing in the prophecy right now that's right we've had a zerubabel that was swn in Babylon but came out he brought the headstone message the seals and he did it with his hands which hands means power and we talked about that plummet or we call it a plumb bob which is a leveling tool and what brother R had to do he had to level this thing up he had to level this the word of God didn't need leveling man needed leveling cuz man got unlevel but God sent us a tool right call William brandom to bring that thing right back to where we can say that ain't nothing but the just like hady Wright did right that's right amen you just got to start believing this message folks that God sent it to you he didn't send it to your neighbor he sent it to you and listen what are we going to do about it the Bible says go on to Perfection not being babies anymore that you have to feed them bottles and we got to grow up right we we' had a grownup message right somebody say Amen am we've had a grown up message so what are we doing about it so in Kings we read this Sunday I read it again it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor answer nor any that regarded in other words they were bringing their doctrines to Mount Carmel and they were their Doctrine was going to bring their God right doesn't your Doctrine bring your God good or bad right or wrong your Doctrine is what your your God is your do your Doctrine when you say well I believe he's one of three that's your Doctrine right right well we know he's one true and living God yeah that's our Doctrine right and it's the real one it's not the false one it's the real one amen they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice so we know in the end time is when this happen happen we know these in types I'll go through it real quick so Elijah said unto the people come near unto me and all the people came near and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down he took all those stones which are Revelations and he put them right back in order and then he actually also put the sticks in order that's what he says he put the sticks in order the way they're supposed to he cut the sacrifice up the way it was supposed to laid it on the Altar and then that's when God came on the scene you and I have got to get this thing right we've got to get our rocks in place we got to get our Revelation in place we got to get our sticks in place you got to get your sacrifice where it's supposed to be too right ex and then God will do exactly what he did on Mount Carmel he'll come down and consume you amen right amen so let's read Second Kings I was thinking about this a few minutes ago I just added it in there this is Elijah and Elisha now remember Elisha type who Elisha Ted the bride right all right Elijah took his mantle now that mantle means Glory Splendor and magnificence it's also a Shaw but it had some power behind it right it had some anointing on it probably if you saw it you didn't think much of it but there was power behind it right he smoked the water and they were divided hither and thither so that the two went over on dry land now remember when those two went across let me tell you how this is when those two went across there was 50 sons of the Prophet standing on the bank with them read your Bible 50 sons of prophets which they had a hard time they had a they had some real bad Revelation cuz they was going to drink something or eat some porridge that was poison until what until Elijah showed up and throw something in the in the pot you need a prophet to make everything right you got to have a prophet you can't be a son of a prophet sure you can be but look how they got it wrong you need a prophet amen you need a prophet to tell you these things and we had a prophet to tell us these things Elijah said unto Elisha when they were gone over Elisha said to Elijah ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me remember he did eight Elijah did four we're doing signs and wonders all over the world all over the world Amen so brother brandom's message is not dry and it's it's still moving there's people still being healed that's right and he said thou H has ask a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee now we're getting into revelation here hang on a second it shall be so unto thee but if not in other words if you don't see me go you're not going to get a double portion right there's a lot of people hadn't seen him left yet or that he's coming back hello don't get quiet cuz Elijah said if Thou shalt see me when I'm taken away right it shall be so unto thee and it came to pass as they went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire horses of fire and part of them both a sun and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chish of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more they was no coming back of Elijah and he saw him no more he got out of Revelation Elijah wasn't coming back no more and that Revelation caused him to get a double portion amen hello somebody that's what he said and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two he took also the manle that Elijah fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan now what was that manle it was an anointing right the bride has the same anointing Elijah's gone Elijah is not coming back until he comes back at the resurrection but he's not coming back to preach Elijah never preached another sermon once he's gone he's gone Moses thy servant is dead sometimes we need to cut things off and forget about the past we got to move forward God wants us to move forward he took up also the man of Elijah that fell and went back and stood by Jordan and he took the manle of Elijah that fell from him and smoked the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also smitten in the waters they part Ed hither and thither and Elijah went over he was not questioning where he was he was just saying wherever that God is he's right here where is the Lord God of Elijah and that's the same with me and you but you know what happened a little bit later on brother Bob I was reading the scripture a little bit further them 50 prophets what' they say can we go look for him sounds like today don't it amen go thank you brother can can can we go look for him and Elisha said don't go and they said we think he might be over there on the mountain somewhere we think he might be back in the woods Elisha said go ahead they came back and they said we can't find him he said I told you I told you not to go that's right you wasted your time amen I know we don't at this church but there's a lot of people waste their time sitting around waiting for Brother Brown to come back amen I said waste their time right this message is too precious to sit on our rear end and not do anything and think we can wait for something to come amen that's not even scriptural never has been scriptural walk I just want Jesus to come back he's the one that saved me he's the one that healed me he's the one that revealed this message to me I want him to come back and he is here in his people but don't you want to see him one day don't you want to look at him that's what I was thinking about that woman sitting there that he had just healed she was looking now not literally but at one day that woman was looking literally in the face of Jesus right those people that walked with the real Jesus 2,000 years ago they were looking right in the face of God and what they do with him they killed him they do the same to me and you who you think you are right and daughter of God that has a revelation that'll take us out of here that's what I contend to be Matthew 17:9 they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead now I went back and looked and just to clear up something because I know Lis interpreted this for me one day at um brother Samuel racis church I preached on that the Bible original Bible the the diglot and the interpretation that he was reading out of his uh Spanish Bible it doesn't say again right so you had to tell the people you had to stop remember we had to tell the people that cuz they were all going where'd he get that from well I contend that that that whoever wrote this which we know it was describes it when King James said here you know they put two people in a room give them the same scripture and they came out with with all this together there had to be some kind of Revelation there for them to add that word again everybody with me they didn't just add that just because they wanted to add it there was something to that that I believe that the Holy Ghost said all right put this in just for an end time bride put this in just when somebody can look and say brother Ram stood one day and he said you've crucified the son of man you put him back on the cross and put him to an open shame you killed him again right right well there's that scripture until the son of man be risen again from what the dead denomination we were in the deadness we're still in so that's for us amen amen don't it make you happy that you can look in the Bible and see yourself amen and what's happening in your time right now right amen that's it one day it'll strike some of you that there's cold as a pickle in the winter time why do we keep saying pickles what's we keep picking on pickles let's don't pick on pickles that's what brother R said I know and it's yeah okay I'll use it and his disciples that you know that's just what we all go to you know useless as a bump on a pickle well there's bumps on a lot of things is useless just to wake you up for a minute minute look his disciples asked him said why then say the scribes that the must first come and we know for a fact see they were standing there in the in the coming of the third Elijah everybody with me John the Baptist they were standing in that anointing right cuz John had come he was already in prison or may already have been killed by this time so their their thought was not on our Elijah that came to us right come on we're disciples now that thought is on us now we we realize we know by the end time message the son of man has to rise again in the end time in a bride and it had to come through an Elijah anointing but they're asking this question in verse 10 according to Malachi 4 like I said before the Jews know Elijah has to show up before the coming of the Lord right they just missed the first coming they're going to get the coming through the two prophets right why then say the scribes that Elias must first come Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things we know one thing for sure that was not John the Baptist's job that was brother bram's job that was number Four's job to restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers to restore all these loose ends that we have had down through the time that's what that's what's bound God folks it's false Doctrine God can't work all the way in false Doctrine when they had showed that the movie last night when uh he walked into jer's house and those people were you know they were wailing and the guy was playing the flute and he said stop am and then remember he said well we're doing this because they're dead he said she's not dead she's just sleeping and they laughed at him they didn't laugh after a while but remember what he had to do brother Ry said he couldn't heal that girl till he got all that unbelief out of the house amen he took Peter James and John the mama and the daddy and that was it right and raised that girl up even Jesus in his Humanity even almighty God had to get the unbelief out of the house so he could heal that person amen see what unbelief will do for you yes see what unbelief will do for you it it'll let God can't work the way he wants to amen that's why we're called Believers we you know if when we first come in message I know a lot of you have been in it for a long time and we come in in the late 60s and a lot later you know some of y'all later on than that but wasn't it refreshing to know that you had something that you had read for years if you were a Christian if you were not if you just come from the world it was all fresh amen but you read the Bible way different now than you read it back then same words same version but you look at it and you go wow why didn't I see that before why didn't I see it that way before it's so plain what happened in the garden they ate an apricot or they ate an apple well ain't that what they always say I mean everybody they ain't hardly many people believe that that uh um somebody called me yesterday and asked me a question about the you know they dug up those bones of those crrom Magnum men they have these different eras right some of y'all that know what I'm talking about if you took science in school in that in different eras they had a man and he they're they're they're really saying Evol from a monkey cuz he walked down like this and had a real flat head they found listen they found the bone so the person had to be there right amen but somebody asked it why they look like that and we look like us now why they look like that because when they put all the when they put the U skin around them they do look kind of animalistic everybody with me Cain the Beast that was that line I'll promise you Abel didn't look like Cain and Cain didn't look like Adam come on somebody he look like an animal almost so that's and that tells you the whole story but but now but you go tell that to somebody and they're like what do you mean it was an apple well it was an apple that made them people look like that no it was a mystery that thank God you and I can look at those pictures and know that wasn't Evolution we didn't come from Monkey right but there was a beast now you can't you can't go away from there was a beast in between the monkey and the man right they look kind of this way and kind of this way right everybody with me right so there had to be a little bit of DNA coming out of here and over here to make it little like that to make it look like what they call cavemen look like the old cavemen well that's where it come from had to be at um had to be Cain's children had to be because the Beast was done away with so you can't put him in there but you got to have Cain and all his descendant with that DNA in it going down through time and developing and then they got mixed back and forth and everybody comes in like we're doing right now we all look maybe not so much like monkeys but we act like them sometimes yes well the praise the Lord there's a little history lesson science am history kids write that down but I say you don't do that and don't do it in school don't don't say that that there's a beast and the no don't do that no let your mom and daddy do if they need to but don't go around telling people that Eve had relations with the Beast and it's okay just just listen to what we're saying and you'll learn later on while we're in such shape right but I say to you that a lias has come already now Jesus is telling them he's come already now he ain't talking about number four now he's talking about number three right cuz there CU three is there and they know what happened to John they know what's happening to John they know that John's either in prison already had his cut head cut off cuz he said but they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he sping to them with John the Baptist we can see that but we also see that our Elijah is in there too cuz he restored all things brother random that that gift that he had sure it's like we were talking about it was a minor but it brought the people tried to get them to a major right all right cuz we don't major on gifts we on the word of God being correct amen amen not the word of God being correct what we see of the word of God being correct the word of God's always been correct there's never been a time when the word of God was incorrect man has made it incorrect by their what Jesus even stood there said by your Traditions you've made the word of God of none effect and he was talking about the Old Testament they had even started writing the New Testament yet right right so remember this messenger of Malachi 4 we got to split it apart cuz one thing he's going to do he did it in the early part of his ministry and the second part he did in the later part of his ministry according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths now listen you have got to be a student of divine revelation amen amen you got be it's a requirement amen that we be college students now not Elementry kids amen amen it's and it's required to understand these things right but if this if you have a problem with what we're fixing to get into which is going to be the the I don't say deep it's not deep but the mysteries of God are deep to people that ain't been digging in them amen right right exactly one more time the mysteries of God are Mysteries until you dig into them okay the hidden revealed truth is something you got to work on something I've got to work on something I got to study and you got to study it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so but consider this this Prophet Messenger will be in the nature and manner of Elijah so we know that and John the people of this prophet Messengers day now watch the people now who is the people me and you right the people of this Prophet Messengers day will be as they were in ahab's day and in John's and since it is only the children whose Hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen right and we were all when we heard this message and accepted this message we were all children right cuz every idea you had was wrong every idea every denomination you came up in you had to kick all that out first Thessalonians I love this scripture because there's three things happen and it's right here it's right here right it's not coming so see again the denomination of the world and I say the denomination the world the people that don't follow this message a shout to them is just oh we got some God's coming you know the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout all right here comes a physical Lord as I told you before that guy told me one time said I'll just be so glad when the Eastern Sky splits and Jesus Walks down out of the clouds I said well if you do I said you missed the Rapture and that about blowed his mind because he knew what a Rapture was he said what do you mean I said that's God coming as judgment that's God where every eye will see him I said the Bible tells me he'll come as a thief in the night right that only a certain group of people will know who it is it won't be a public show it won't be him where everybody the whole world there will be a time but it'll be in judgment it will be he won't come down here as Savior right right now he's here as Savior he's descended in a message that is a prophetic message that will save you heal you and take you in a Rapture right true the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air folks there's a day that's going to happen it ain't far off I know the Bible says that and see the Bible even tells you that there's people that says oh well that that's been told since the dawn of time you know granny said the Lord was coming great grandma said to the Lord be ready the Lord's coming brother random said it could be any day now and that's been 60 70 years ago but there's going to be a day it's going to happen right and if you're a foolish virgin you're not going to hear it you're going to hear it but you can't go to it because there's nothing you could do about it right cuz you didn't study he didn't come to church right it's a little foxes this Bal Divine that's it I Tell You Folks every time I'm away from this Pulpit whoever preaches here believe you me don't I every one of you know that I'll send you a note the next day or even that night I'll say I love appreciate the message you did a good job why I watch it I don't watch it to see if Bob's doing the right thing Louise you should have not said that I have said that a few times but so is everybody else but um but I I listen to I listen to get something I missed the service do you do that do you do that some of you are not shaking your head cuz you don't and this is a progressive message folks this is a progressive Ministry this is not a Ministry like anybody I've seen before I'm I'm going to get on my soap box for a minute yeah you can go to certain places and they'll pick a scripture they'll preach on that one they'll go over here and preach on another one on this one the next Sunday they'll go over here Aaron shaking his head and some of you that's been out preaching you know that right we preach in a progressive revelation as teaching all right well listen some of y'all that went through school I know some of you like my brother wanted to miss a few grades but um on purpose but you got to go to school to learn you got to go to school it's required this is required amen listen watch that's why that there's going to be no excuse in this day none right in other ages before you can say I wasn't there they weren't making tapes I'm sorry Lord not now that's right you can get it instantly I know some of you brother Luis I know for a fact watches it coming home if he's preaching they're watching it coming home on the uh on the phone right right right that's not doing it out of out of ritual right it's doing it to get something from God but if you think you know more than the preacher does then you need to be the pastor right sorry but don't get quiet on me amen right I need to listen to them they're your pastor too amen them three right there that's right I just get everything dumped on me they get to say what they say and walk out amen but that's all right I ain't built for it but do we have is it that important though that's my whole point is it that important it is a shout it is the voice of God speaking to you whether it's me standing here or any of the other brothers standing here that preaches a word of God even if we don't say anything that you understand but just a few words right it's a shout it's a shout to turn our attention when we first got saved when we first got saved and we we were saying a denomination come on guys we just didn't there's something about that you didn't want to stay there you didn't want to stay there you knew there was something like brother R said that little seed well I know you know what it was it was a word of God calling your name from somewhere else oh I just got that I just got that while you were doing whatever you were doing there was this word being called somewhere right that called your name through the airwaves and it picked up over there where you were and brought you here not brought you here physically but brought you into this message thank God right for the message of the hour yes and this is the Lord himself descending from heaven with a shout what a message brother R will tell us the voice of the Archangel which will be coming through the bride right right listen there's not going to be an archangel go walk over there at the cemetery with a great big old what you call them things show far and and all the Dead come out of the ground right ask somebody you know about that that's not in the message and see what they say right they'll tell you the same thing they're waiting all this stuff to happen and brother Bram told the Pentecostal one day he said it's already happened and you didn't know it he said whatever you're saying you're saying latter rain he said nonsense you hadn't had the former rain first yet they they were going way past we don't need to go way past we need to stay right where we're at stay right in the doctrine that we're being told right now shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God brother Brown called the Trump of God that's when the call to the marriage supper that's when we take a Rapture see the voice of the Archangel is to wake up the dead that's the resurrection then we're going to be carried away to a marriage supper by when the Trump of God sounds I'll read it to you in just a second around tells us the whole thing right here a shout what is a shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride not the church bringing forth the bride Rapture message again first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it is a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time we were talking about that Sunday I was going to bring a lamp I forgot to but lamp trimming time is important amen amen to trim a lamp to make it to make it Glow the way it's supposed to be without giving off a lot of s and black stuff you got to trim it right and you know what it's not real hard but you just got to do it amen I hope somebody's getting something tonight now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps listen rise and come to sanctification trim off all the black trim off all the things that make you hard and not not so much forgiving we could be we supposed to be forgiving people that's right forgiving people cuz that's what our master was he was forgiving look at all the times you'll you'll even see in the movie he'll just forgive them with their sins and then the people around him like wow what' he do he forgave them of their sins you know what if you lose somebody from from uh bondage if they ask you something you've lose them from their sins right remember he said what I bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven what I loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven right amen it's a message to get the people together a message come forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watch was it the seventh not the sixth it's Malachi four time it's Luke 17 Isaiah all these prophecies that he can perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture we see it living right there amen that was in 1965 what about today now watch brother random he gets real specific here like I said last Sunday this is just a few days 20 days before he died he's coming down the end of his message he's just like Jesus Jesus told him a lot of many times he said don't worship me worship the father I'm not your master this worship God but when they come to that night of that uh communion he said you say I'm your master and Lord and you say well for so I am he was honing it down Amen to say yes I'm he and I'm not going to be here a long time but I want you to realize that's who I am brother rown wanted people to realize watch this when I went when I went forth into the meetings with you oh who is he talking to the people sitting there the Pentecostal praying for the sick it was fine but when I come with a message if any message Goes Forth it's a true message if it's the true genuine miracles of god and hangs right in that or now watch if it's the true genuine miracles of god and hangs in that organization you know it's not of God right cuz that thing's already declared in other words that thing's already been declared to be dead what he's telling them Jesus went forth and healed the sick in order to catch their eyes to people then his message it has to have something that God is going to introduce that's why people if you still hang on Divine Healing and all the Miracles of brother randam you're behind yeah right you're behind you're in the first part you're in the first pull we're third pull you're in the first pull or even the second pull we got to be third po people and we'll we'll we will explain that also a little bit later on all right so just believe it right now you're third we're third pool people it has to have something that God is going to introduce Divine Healing his miracles like that just catch the eyes of the people the main heart of it is the message have we caught that right that's what what comes in from from in here he's trying to get the favor of the people so they'll sit and listen to him for there's some in there that's ordained to life he didn't say there's some there that need to be healed right he said there's some there that's ordained in other words the healing of the Soul right now the first thing sounds first thing is a trumpet now he he got a little mixed up now shout a voice and then a trumpet shout is a message getting the people ready we have heard that messenger we have fulfilled that scripture we have heard the shouten 99% of the world have not but we heard that shout you and I are under that shout what are we doing about it the second is a voice of the Resurrection the same voice loud voice in St John 11 that called Lazarus from the grave and who was that it was the son of man right God standing in human flesh in front of a tomb and said Lazarus come forth amen that's right getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it now watch these three things take place a shout a voice of trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always at Feast of the trumpets calling the people to the feast and that'll be the bride supper the lamb supper with the bride in the sky we get married here and then we go to a marriage supper in the sky or actually in another dimension everybody with me I'm not going to read you know what happened to the 10 vers there's five wise there's five foolish all right listen they both heard the bridegroom call B bridegroom call all right and at midnight there was a cry behold the bridegroom cometh go you out and meet him all the virgins arose and they trimmed their lamps right what are foolish virgins they're Sanctified Believers come on it's not Devils they're Sanctified Believers now they stopped in their Journey they didn't get any oil they didn't get the Holy Ghost they were told that just believe the message and press play anyway goe and then the foolish at least they weren't so foolish to not know where to go get it brother Bob they go to the ones that got it right amen give us your teaching we haven't been taught that we've been taught different come on don't get quiet that's exactly what's GNA happen those foolish virgin are foolish virgins that's going to be given eternal life right they're foolish but they're virgins they're trying they're trying all they can hear from a pull pit right but if a pull pit can't preach it they're not going to get it right foolish said unto wise give us your oil for our lamps are gone out but to wise answer and said not so L there be enough for us and you but but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourself and while they went to buy the bridegroom came the door was shut right right we better know where we are amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever he's identifying himself as he promised much more we could say this is 1964 in these last days as son of man making himself known among his people in the form of his people not one person in his people right there is no son of man Ministry without people right now when the first son of man was on Earth he was the son of man right ordained to come the way he came everybody with me there was no other son of man manifestation nowhere he was it that's right that's why he was a headstone the son of man was The Headstone to the church but what did they do they rejected him he had to go away come back as the Holy Ghost everybody with me come back in the form of the Holy Ghost in the people but promised in the end time to come back again and do the same thing but in a many membered body not just one person right amen right brother Brandon was not the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man we he said that himself amen so he comes in the form of his people not Son of God now watch not Son of God so what does a prophet do he's turning a corner he's bringing us from the church ages he's transitioning us to the perfection in this age right not Son of God not son of David but son of man the Son of God was the supernatural like Abraham he seen voices heard things seen lights but just before the promised son come what did God do he showed up at Adam's tent I mean Abraham's tent a man in human flesh read the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart in the room behind him he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the Son of God coming when the son of man shall be being revealed the son of man being revealed not the Son of God in the church age everybody with me this is different I I was looking at my church Church age book is closed it was open during this whole time we were talking about the church ages right I'm trying to make a point here right right it's closed now cuz there's nothing in that book I I don't say listen don't get me wrong brother Brown talked about the church ages 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 but now you and I are the people that's living that all those other ages are dead people are already gone churches are already gone uh ministers are already gone everybody with me we are at the end of the book right listen don't ever believe that I don't we don't need a church AE book no more you better read that thing like that one with the cover off of it but what I'm saying is I don't have to go back and say well let's look at the history of brother randam no we lived it sister C actually lived it brother George Canada brother Mike Canada different they actually lived lived it saw the manifestation saw what was happening and thank God we have him still here with us but it's not the Son of God in the church age now do we believe brother R was a prophet or not when we going to make the when are we going to make that transition we got to step up right right can't do away with the Son of God but there's a manifestation of the son of man that's going to be it listen Martin Luther had the Holy Ghost right John Wesley had the Holy Ghost amen but they didn't have all the word they were reformers they still were trinitarians God can't anoint a trinitarian Doctrine brother Brown said it come from the pits of hell so God can't anoint that but what about a prophet in the end time though he's brought us to a place that he stood one day and he said that come from the pits of hell you don't need to there's not a father son holy ghost there's not a Trinity there's not three Gods right there's one God Amen yes sir that was his whole messag and as I think brother Bob the other day we were talking about up here that first seal shows you that there's only one God Amen when that book opened to reveal the mystery the Myster was here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes two people of the Trinity no that's what he said he said if you have two he said therefore one's got to be God and one's got to be the devil right that's the mystery of iniquity he taught them right now if they didn't believe it it's on them amen the message to us folks you say oh that was them over there they didn't know nothing let me tell you something if you do the same thing here that's why iniquity shall abound knowing to do better and don't don't do it we've had the full seven course meal right we know how listen we know how to be Christian right we know we know what to do by letter but do we do it by life not the Son of God in the church age he's put out of that now he son of man revealing himself the word is becoming flesh Among Us I contend that this year you're going to see a difference in the bride right I didn't say Church you're going to see a difference in this year coming up this will be 2025 there'll be a difference in the bride the bride but now remember the bride will never be bad ever right you said oh we'll lose members and we'll lose if we lose members it's just members well I'm going to preach anyway it's just members I said bride bride will never leave this message bride will never walk away from this message ever walk away from it that's right so the Mysteries will be revealed in the last day when the Seven Angels Church message comes not when he starts out doing this what healing campaign when he begins to sound his message not in the years of preparation listen that was the years of they needed the years of preparation even we did when we first come in the message what they do well some of you I know you did they they handed you what a church a book or a seal book your daddy did right is that all right seal book all right well it's like Daddy said you need to lay that aside and get the church a book seal book May choke you okay well it did but it handed you a church age book and when you read that church age book that was okay but when you got to listen to the tapes don't tell me you didn't you were enamored with that manifestation of the son of man at the end of the message when he stood there and told him the thoughts and intents of the heart don't most of you are shaking your head yes amen now I you you listen to the tape no doubt but you wanted to listen to that when you got to that that just that was that AED you he should have but remember that's a minor that's supposed to get your attention to when you listen to the next tape you don't wait till the end because listen if he calls out suie and her her car color and her house number that ain't going to save your soul it really didn't save Susie Soul either it was a Healing Ministry that healed prostitutes as well as Christians right so it's not in years of preparation that's not what we're looking at now right not the years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these Mysteries will be revealed and here they are listen to a prophet and here they are not knowing them and you people are witness of that oh how about that I'm going to tell you you people are witness of that too what you going to do with it you sit there and sleep your life away or what right something's got to spark in here right are you're just going like you are that's just you so to watch what brother BR said now look this is Endtime seed sign but we're going to get in spoken words rid seed real quick then we'll close the word has been sown all right denominations will reap denomination that makes them Confederate themselves together amen exactly you watch this coming up year and the next year if we make it there's going to be a church and state come together yeah right I think we just elected a Constantine we may get cut cuz that's what he's been wanting to do bring church and state together well listen when when Constantine brought church and state together who got persecuted Christians one more time CHR Christians real true Christians are the one that got persecuted not all Brides bride them people that were that were praying for him that's okay that's fine that's all right but if they ain't bride that didn't do them no good it just brought them there their Constantine to make them act that way I just I that's just the way I feel right cuz there's nothing good going to come out of any of this except me and you being driven closer to God and to be driven closer to God we got to be driven out of the world that's where our persecution going to come from it's going to come from the religious World Sinners don't bother us who bothers you more than anything a religious person your own family I think I'll preach but the word of God has been sown also that's right well it's time to be plain I mean we've got to be different amen something inside of us has got to be different than the world am but the word of God has been swed also and when the spirit of God begins to fall watch when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God will live in the people that's right amen so I pray the spirit of God Begin to Fall Hallelujah right and that false bride that's committed adultery out there and brought herself into Creeds and sold out her Birthright will reap what a Constantine a confederation of church that's to be bound and burn like the thorns and thistles but where the word of God's been sewed into the people's heart it will reap a bride for Christ as certain as I'm standing here in time signs B word's Original Seed the seed's been planted there's a planting time and a harvest time now there's been three different kinds of seeds planted a denominational bu Graham he was the head planter Oral Roberts for the Pentecostals Pentecostal seed has been planted I'm talking about organization now and when the word and then the word has been planted in other words or robberts Billy Graham and his message right right that's right and then the word has been planted now you'll have to understand folks I ain't saying this no more unless God tells me I want you to get this good and clear three seeds has been planted that's the reason the planting it's about over that was 1962 seeds must be planted before the rainfalls amen or otherwise the spirit now you're going to disagree there but hold on just a minute seeds must be planted and then the rain falls to water the seed now we're heing so much and so many organizations and everything else talking about we're in the latter rain nonsense you and I are in the latter rain right they were not they were getting their teaching rain thinking that it was their Harvest rain that's how deceived they were now listen God didn't deceive him the devil did that's right nonsense no such a thing SE have been planted let's continue on just a second I believe that the word of God has been planted unadulterated away from any of those organizations that's what's the matter what in other words just separating the seed plant must have seed work water before it can grow it must have water and you see that water is capitalized that's right before the seed has been planted can grow they said a million more in 44 the teaching Reign went forth Billy Graham struck the world Pentecostal the word is struck the world now what's the matter now she's now waiting for the latter rain but remember the latter rain is the Harvest rain right amen the latter rain Harvest mature plants mature seed right there was no mature seed back then to take a Rapture the mature seed is here now we got to start showing it folks it's here what I'm saying we preached all this all our life this thing here the actors are on the stage everything's ready that's when she produces her fruit that's what I said as it gets harder and harder and harder people are going to fall away and fall away and fall away right amen then the kind of seed you planted in your field will be the crop that you you will reap amen so now brother brandom goes through all this spoken words Original Seed six hours everybody with me six hours 3 in the morning took a break 3 in the afternoon right that's it that's an idea three hours okay but but I look this is 1962 here's my point look I made that big I already showed you this one time show you again this was 1962 brother randam had preached Daniel 70 weeks he had preached the church ages he had preached on the seals but he preached them all in one sermon you've heard this before if you've been here long enough brother Dell told us this a long time ago all these different things have been preached that brother randam thought well I've got them this is my message I'm done right there's nothing else to do this is when right here paragraph 430 right before that brother rown said the Holy Ghost told me to pick up my pen and write this right here so we can believe it or not but this comes straight from God God has promised be careful God has promised Malachi 4 for this last day and Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled I bet that was a shocker to him when he started writing that down but it must be fulfilled for it is a germatize word of God spoken through Malachi the prophet Jesus referred to it it's just before the coming of Christ the second time listen close now all scripture that has been that has not been fulfilled must be before that time the Bible is to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed mage messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible from from the serpent to the messenger in the former Reign he's identifying who he is without telling him it's him then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefather John and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord 1962 he was still accepted 1962 he could go and preach just about anywhere he wanted to but when he come to spoken word Original Seed then he started preaching um the seals then he got on the marriage and divorce then he got on to uh why am I against organized religion and really bringing out the serpent seed yeah they started cutting him off amen you know why they weren't right seed right for the right time that's right right all right one last thing I'm going to skip all the way through this we'll get to this a little bit later but I want to bring you this last thing don't get sick watching this we know it's the son of man Ministry and we are in the days of the voice we know that right all right so I don't have to read that again now watch brother BR was preaching on the on the um this is a church age book all right when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there's again another people in the land do we believe brother rown was a prophet we believe he's prophesying he's seeing something come who under their Messenger will be the final voice to the final age now remember when he's standing there preaching this and and when they redid the church age book it was right about time of the seal so it 63 when they put it all together this is a compilation this is your church age book this is not the individual message right yes sir the church is no longer the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God in other words Catholics are not the mouthpiece of God it has its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride one more time he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her amen amen now watch in the last chapter of Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the bride the spirit and the bride says come it's the same amen the spirit's in the bride then we only got one Voice once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost but of course that word bride will be repudiated as in the first age amen all right let me give you something right here and then we're going to close musicians get ready to come we'll read this later on next week sometime but I want to get down to this last part I want to get down to thus sayth the Lord all right everybody with me shake yourself for a minute just two more minutes let me read this this is 1963 you've heard me quote it you've heard brother Dale quotee it many times I'm going to read it to you in 1963 on questions and answers on the seals now that was on Sunday he started preaching the seals the first seal he preached on Monday everybody with me amen one 2 3 4 five Saturday he preached The Sixth Seal and he had questions and answers Sunday morning and then preach the seventh seal Sunday night all right so are we there we're sitting in we're sitting there watching him all right we're we're in the room with him right right all right and then also knowing that right among you things are happening see that I'm just I know you that you don't see it I'm just positive that you don't see it do we still believe brother brownan was a prophet he's prophesying because remember I'm fixing to read it to you he said it's thus sayith the Lord right it's right here I I hit it for a minute now I got to it right here I'll just I'm just positive you don't see it you say brother rown that's a hard thing for you to say that I know it is but look let me just say this now I suppose this is just on tape for oursel I'm glad it wasn't it was for oursel and so forth but let me say this you you don't get it now he this is the second time he's told him this and you're not supposed to get it amen right amen can you imagine a prophet standing there knowing that that whole group of people ever how many hundreds of people in that in that church at the Tabernacle that morning standing around the walls been listening all week praising the Lord he said you ain't getting it and you're not even supposed to get it right all right so don't try to interpret anything don't try to put your interpretation to it well we've seen that before that they have you only get further away just take my advice if you believe me now if God has given me favor in your sight and you know that them Revelations and things I've been here with you a long time and it's been right and now to double prove it right it hooks right in with the word see so you know it's thus saith the Lord so what he's saying is thus sayith the Lord that's exactly it's proved to you all right that's right now I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it amen he's fixing the preach the seven seal but so help me with this Bible in my hand I know what it is so do I we weren't there right right and so but if the church you're not supposed to know these things wow so don't put no interpretation to anything see you just go ahead and remember what you're told live a Christian Life go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for Christ and tell the people how you love him and just let your testimony be with love all the time with the people see cuz if you don't you'll twist yourself out into something there and you're off the Beaten Track right so really it's not for them to understand and if they tried to understand it they're going to mess it up and they did amen don't try to make no interpretation especially tonight now watch tonight is what the seventh seal especially tonight when that seal becomes in front of you see just don't try to interpret it you just go ahead and be humble go right on with the same plain message now you say brother Brown being the Church of God shouldn't we well as I was trying look here and I see he he picked up their thought somebody saying well we're sitting here we've been here all week we surely were picking up something right why said well now brother around the church of living God shouldn't we he stops he said well as I was trying look here I want to say why can't I in other words why brother BR why can't I understand this right no no don't you remember I'm saying this for your good I'm saying it so that you'll understand if you believe me now listen to what I tell you see see now here's a post we'll call that a listening post and in it got radio there's warnings and things can be done like sword in your hand see I can pick from the evil are pick from only as it gets its message see remember it's just a receptor there has to be something speaking to it and it don't interpret it just tells exactly what it said right but now for instant to the ordinary man there's been so many Cults and clans rise up over little outpourings of the spirit until people get all worked up in a bunch of stuff go out and start another move and you know things we've seen it happen so you don't want to do that now now just just stay the Way You Are man he's telling these people stay the way you are this is not for you now look let me show you something did you know there's 10,000 voices in this room well if there was 10,000 back then there's 10 million in this room right now there wasn't cell phones they wasn't all this internet stuff there wasn't the wireless stuff in 1964 or three as much as there is now so I'll promise you a lot more is going through this room than was during his time so why don't you hear them you know what he's telling the people you're hearing me but you're not hearing me you have no receptor to pick up what I'm telling you you're hearing my physical voice but you're not catching the Revelation they're waving right through here now there's people forms and bodies moving right through this room same here is that right well why don't you see them they're here actual voices look like my voice pretty plain like my voice well why don't you hear it see it's got to strike something first to reveal it now don't you understand so just don't interpret nothing if God wants you to know anything he'll send it to you that's right amen remember this is thus sayith the Lord so just be real real solid now whole still something has happened he's not saying this cuz nothing's happened Something's Happened they just can't get it right right there's voices in the room voice of God in the room they're just not hearing it don't try to make yourself odd to be a Christian cuz you take yourself away from God and you you if you can understand it this is that third pull you should have caught that the other day so then just you remember there'll be no impersonation like there was the other too and we'll cover that later on so that's as far as you should know just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room amen anybody with me there's something taking place in this room and there's something here there's actual in this room Angels voice of God in this room right but how do you you can't if you can't hear the natural Voice without something to send it out how you going to hear the spiritual voice right right now you might may believe that somebody's singing this certain song that might not even be there see but it when act when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike just call me Crystal but when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike then it gives a true interpret ration and vindicates it by showing the picture see what I mean now the spirit of God when it speaks through the two word true word it vindicates vindicates itself to show itself that is right you understand now let's stand to our feet what a privileged group of people we are amen that when the voice of God does speak through these ministers and teachers and different ones Sunday school teachers that we can get something we can hear the voice of God not the voice of somebody else it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture amen you take a television right now with just a set of ears and you set it right here and you turn it on it's going to pick up something now why are we not seeing it because we don't have the right receptor but brother rand's telling us thus sayith the lord they're not getting it but it's for us Amen to get if you'll listen to the voice of God Amen it'll show the picture that's right have you seen the picture yet you seen the picture where you're supposed to be have you see if you ask God where am I supposed to be Lord what am I supposed to be doing right put me somewhere where I can listen and hear the voice of God and see the voice of God working in a group of people because it wasn't for them but I'll promise you it's for us we are that group of people that have the right crystal that are the right receptors to hear the voice of God when it comes through this room amen or your room at home or your truck your chicken truck wherever God decides to speak to you you have that receptor turned on and you'll hear what he says let's sing a song man greater than all my sin greater than all my S is the that's still [Music] cleanses me it's the grace that still sets me free to do what oh to praise [Music] him I know the blood of BL I'm walking in newness of life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the Lamb oh greater than all my sin is the blood that still [Music] cleanses me it's the grace that still sets me free to praise him I know the blood I'm walking in newness of life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the Lamb oh greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses me it's the grace that still sets me free to praise [Music] him I know the blood of I'm walking in newness of life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the Lamb amen and brother R told us he said what in the end time he said the bride is the blood by the spirit amen the bride we're the we're the blood covering sorry if you got Christ in you because when we leave what's going to happen what's going to happen when we leave the blood's gone except going to the Jews for the Gentiles there's no more person to be saved there's no Holy Ghost here to save them it all goes to the Jews but let's get it let's be the crystal let's be the receptor and just ask God say look Lord we're coming to a time where we can't play we're coming to a time where I got to understand what's going on and put somebody in the p bed to help me right I said put somebody in the pull bit to help me amen amen do you want that yes I want that I want to go on and be that receptor that God saw brother brown maybe didn't see Terence Dale standing in a in a church in Lula Georgia but I believe God showed him the bride and that that was bride but that wasn't the ones there that was supposed to get what he was talking about but there is a group over here that's going to receive it and get it and live it understand it and be a part of this that's right I don't want to be left behind I don't want to be left out I hate being left [Music] out and God will never leave you out if you'll ask him am he's knocking in the door of you too you're the one that got to let him in and brother Brown said even when he gets into your house he said you got doors inside of doors that if you don't want God to go in there he was polite he won't go in there but let's open all of our doors this year coming up we've been talking for two or three years to let it out well you know what let's start using what we've let out yesen let's start you when when that message was released from Brother brandom it began to drop on people people and they began to understand maybe just a few here and a few there then they would gather as a church then in 1971 we gathered as a church and then we started under the message of the hour and then it grew to more churches and it grew to more churches cuz in 1971 there wasn't many message churches right wasn't many maybe two or three four or five around this area there was only a couple but she's grown cuz somebody's picked up the receptor of God for their day has picked up their favorite radio station and you're listening to it you go get you go get in your car tonight and and you turn on the radio and it's rock and roll it's in there all you got to do is find it right if you want to listen to a talk show you can find it am if you want to listen to Christian music contemporary or Southern Gospel you can get it but you know what it takes takes you finding it right takes you finding it you finding it your car is not going to find it for you you got to find it you got to find that radio station that you like that speaks to your soul that speaks to you in this end time to make us grow and get us out of here that's right we going to be tired of this place one of these days guys I know where it EAS and we got all these things going good and all that and Trump may give us something good for the economy I don't know I really don't care but a something got to happen to to just drop this thing like

there was a prophet some years ago William brandham that stood and gave his life so he could bring a message and Men gathered around him and some of them called him God some of them called him false some of them called him this and that and the other but Lord we know he was the prophet to us in the end time and that we would have a voice along with his voice and that we would speak in the end time human beings becoming the son of man not in one person but in a collective body cuz the Bride of Jes Jesus Christ I believe will be the son of man in the end time you you preached that for for through our the prophet for years there at the end to try to get the people to see but that people were not there Lord I know the people are here now yes everything the players are on the field I believe everything's ready Lord I pray that this year coming up if we make it even to the year Lord that you would manifest yourself through us more than ever before that we'll see you more than we've ever been able to see you before and be able to see you through each other Lord I pray these things in Jesus name be with us on the highways Lord and bless us as we come back together on Sunday for brother Bob and brother Aaron there Wednesday just give them Grace and give the people strength to be here father in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you your dismiss of life I cannot fall
