«  E-19       †        And then, just by accepting it won't only do, God's got to vindicate back that He has accepted you. That's the thing. You can accept Him, but then if He accepts you. Stay right there until He does accept you. And then when He does, He seals you into His Kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Then you have, you're secure until the day of redemption. That's right.
    "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed (until the next revival, no, huh-uh,) until the day of redemption." Is that right? There's no ups-and-downs, ins-and-outs; you really get into God. If you're really in Him, not just impersonating something, but you're really in Christ, you're one alternative, your whole heart's sold out; every bridge is burnt behind you; and you got your affections set on things which are above; and you run the race with patience that's set before you. Amen.

«  E-37       †        Don't look at yourself. Look at your Lamb. God don't accept you; He accepted the Lamb. And the Lamb took your place. O God, can't you see it? Not you, you're not worthy. I'm not worthy. There's none of us worthy. But, see, is He worthy? God said so. He accepted Him. He said, "This is My beloved Son in Whom I am well pleased. This is My Son. Hear ye Him," on the day of the adoption, "This is Him."

«  30       †        The circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost. And God gave Abraham the--the circumcision sign after he had accepted God on His promise and walked out into a strange country. See? It was a sign. And all his children and his seed after him should have this sign in their flesh, because it was a distinction. It was to separate them from all other people, this sign of circumcision. And that's what God uses t...

Lord yes we bring everybody safely home and remember Wade Lord wouldn't be flying back I think tomorrow night every evening so remember him and prayed that the Lord would take care of it all right now COO he generally takes care of this but we'll have to do this evening for the Father's Day weekend remember which is next weekend next Thursday Friday and then we'll be coming back in Saturday so if you want to go make sure first that you sign up downstairs to wear that you can do and we will be trying to go up and have a time fellowshipping together and what we need to do this afternoon after the evening service we need to meet with all of those and we will renounce this just this evening renounce it - we need to meet and just you know a few words that we need to do and point out for somebody to do so-and-so and whatever to do so we need to do that this afternoon after the evening service okay so we'll meet in the backroom door with the brothers and all okay uh let's see I think I've covered all announcements but anyhow just remember to pray one for the other the Lord would be with us and then first Kings ten first Kings ten one drew nine okay you have any father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord and thank you for all the things that we have already experienced from you this day of life and peace and joy and happiness and rejoicing and speaking to you in prayers and meditations and things Lord and now we come to the point of where we are to sit back and relax and let you speak to our hearts from your word because that's the wonderful part you said in your words that you sent your word and healed us and deliver us from destruction so it's all involved in the word that you've sent unto us and father help us to understand these things and see that it must be revealed to us personally not to just someone else and we can talk about it but to us ourselves we love you and we thank you and have your way with us in Jesus name Amen verse Kings 10:1 and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord now we're going to get on this evening and be one or two services and we're going to get onto that name of the Lord you know because that's that would be our thoughts and if you will listen or try to read because it's in the conduct order and doctrine on the message questions and answers on Genesis it will be in your first book you got to that's called a condo coder and doctrine but it will be questions and answers on Genesis because we will be starting kind of maybe a little series on the Godhead so we'll be picking up from that part and going on Wade is carrying through into redemption in veins and we want to carry in behind that to follow along so if you well you know just read our listeners that take questions and answers on Genesis 53 I think is the year but in him because we're going to get into something we've got to cover first about the name of the Lord to bring it into being so and when the Queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord she came to prove him with hard questions she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bar spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to Solomon she communed with him all that was in her heart now watch that but not called what's the next version then he told her what's in her heart so we read that the way that is really saying it it's saying that she told him of a report she had heard all right and then he does all of the other because listen to that and get it into my she communed with him all that was in her heart and Solomon told her all requests since there was not anything he had from the King which he told her not and when the Queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and there a pearl and his cut barriers and his accent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord there was no more spirit was no more spirit in her and she said to the king it was a true report that I heard in my own land and what she heard of him right that's why she came she said unsaid to the king it was a true report that I heard in my own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom howbeit I believe not the words until I came in mine own eyes had seen it and behold the - told me thy wisdom and prosperity see that the fame which I heard happier thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before the end that hear thy wisdom blessed be the Lord thy God which delighteth in thee to set the on the throne of his room because the Lord loved Israel forever therefore made he the King to do judgment and justice you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now you know that what we've been doing for quite some time is speaking about you know how that we must have a personal experience with Jesus Christ as our Savior now it's wonderful to hear it we'll review of this in a minute it's wonderful to hear what others have the site of their experience you know but what about yours and that's what I've been speaking on for quite a while and will be going on into many more messages to try to get us to see something personal because it's not just what mama says or daddy says listen it's not even what the Prophet says now listen to another it's not even what God says okay you see them that's not throwing nothing I'm putting it a hole in a whole lot it's what you have experienced within yourself is what you need to be dependent upon all the other is wonderful now you watch you'll see the Queen she comes in that way she'd heard but then she had her own report to be made all right so now what's that about your own experience that's what I'm trying to do is to cover these things to get us to think about it all right now she had heard a report in our country you know travellers going through and things had told her about this great things that was happening in Israel and how that God was doubt had come down and was using Solomon to a great wisdom and glory and things you know and and all of the things she heard about it she heard somebody else but yet she didn't have nothing personal about that at that time but she took what others had said well that's wonderful to take what others have said cause that's the way we hear plague cometh by hearing hearing by the word when somebody else delivers them to us right all right so it's wonderful to hear what somebody else says mama says go to random says God says anything you want to put online it's wonderful for that but then when she got down there and she's seen when I watch what she done she must have had a pretty good you know thought in mind because she took a whole bunch of gold and silver x' and a pearl and all kind of things with her so she was already believing the report pretty good right you know she just didn't go down there empty-handed and ride back and say I'll go get you something bring it to you she was believing it so now that's what I'm trying to get you admitted she believing things in our mental abilities is wonderful you know I think anybody that wouldn't believe in God is not a mental person you know they're not mental at all to not believe in God I don't care what an atheist has to say you know and everything else and they can do this that or the other nothing to me because if you could show me a little blade of grass out in the yard and how it grows and then you tell me there's no God or whatever there's any simple thing so then like I'm say it now to have a mental concept the Prophet said - right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass so the Queen of Sheba had the right mental attitude she had heard report and she was believing the report and she took all of the possessions with her and traveled a long journey riding on the back of a camel and I know they all don't do that but I rode one one time and I wouldn't want to ride from here to Lula on one of the suckers I wrote it in a circle that was glad to get off because this is the way you go is this the way you go you'd want to do that for a week in and week out across the desert you know I would hold him solve them humps off the first time in because it being your wife what all right but listen to say we believe then we're going to get back to the point in a minute of word that I've emphasized over and over of your experience in God and how that you say I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior so I know I'm saved well that's a good example or a thought or a belief but as he accepted you we'll get back to that in a minute and the message because that's still our point it's more than just mental believing but it starts at mental believing she heard the report she believed the report you know cause this is an example maybe she heard this group coming through and maybe the next train around emphasizing one time you know she'd go out and ask him about this and happening and you know he could hear over and over and over of the great things so she begin to believe when we've heard the gospel over and over and over and we need to believe it at least all right but it needs to be more than that and that's my point now when she came down she said verse 6 then what was reading she said I heard in other words a true report now how did she know the report was true you know how did she know the report was true because she saw what they had told her right she saw happening she said I heard a true report she didn't say I just heard a report of you and talked this over and thought I'd ride down and see how it's going no I'm trying to get you to a thought in your mind because all we get from God first starts as a mental talk mental you know thought in your brain all right God don't come down and grab you just open you up and just dump it all in you know no faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word all right and we believe it you know and we believe that report but we ought to be able to do I remember my wife we were listening to tape right after we came in the message and you know she was sitting there we listening to a tape one day and she said like one thing for sure he what happened in that man's life is what he saying happened then we don't have to worry about it he had to be a prophet now that was just a statement you know from your background of what you're thinking a statement to come forward to her if you would be agreeing and knowing that that's right huh so she said I've heard a true report and said now I see see so the way she knew the report was right was the fact that she could then see of the great things taking place are you following me all right and she did she said it's only been hiked old me in other word they don't worry about God's got a lot more all right but she made she heard a report now listen she heard a report she believed a report that was made then she experienced gee you know in her own eyes and think of what she had heard it became an experience to her that was more real than the true report she heard true report was fine but now she has something he can take back to Solomon and she can say it was only high filled me you said you see the way you do in a way everything works and says it's wonderful all right now report is like a speech word you like speak in our utterance so she made a report speaking back to Solomon all right she made the report of what she experienced then proverbs blues 15:30 says the light of the iris rejoices the heart and a good report makes the bones fit in other words you enjoy it it's just something that comes to being enjoyment right to you a good report but what about a false report Philippians 4 and 8 says to witness that report finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things think on these things if it's a good report now what about it as I said she believed a report but then she had a personal experience of seeing that report made okay there's many many reports that have been made throughout the Bible you could take the whole Old Testament and spend the rest of the day talking about Moses at a burning bush when God calls him and said Moses I want you to go down in Egypt and he says ain't going because your Bible this is emphasized he said I'm not going he said but I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he said but I'm not going but then when he witnessed and seen and he asked him as we'll get to this afternoon and then God said in other words Moses said what's your name I go down to tell them the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob who sent me so that's wonderful because they know all about it but I want something personal to be related to me and God said okay just tell them I am that I am and see that made it ever-present for eternity to him because that was not what was said that was an title to a name that when you translate it it comes out to say I am that I am understand what I mean he didn't come to necessarily say I am that I am he said a name he said a title or something and when it is just interpreted I am that I am all right literally it means ever president for eternity okay so now we will get into those salt this afternoon but what about you and your report what about you and your thoughts what is your report you know you go good denominational Church and you say what about Hebrews 13:8 or something and then say well sure we believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but now we believe in to be the second person of the Trinity now is their report correct there was only see this afternoon when you start talking about a name then why brother Branham would make the statement you can call him Jesus Jesus and still not getting nothing why because you may be calling now he said in Spanish hey Zeus or whatever something that you say in Spanish and it won't matter to God because he knows all the name German Chinese whatever they also know who you're approaching and the way you're approaching yeah but you just make it to work you make it too complicated brother Dale what is complicated about it what's complicated to know the truth I thought it was supposed to set us free huh so now think about it when she had a personal experience of seeing what took place then she made the report he says only the hive has been told me to made a wonderful report what is your report we could go with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace Oh King live forever I said we're not going to bow down to your honor it's okay you go in the fiery furnace okay go in the fiery furnace they had a mental concept and thought of God because there was no holy ghost back there to bring on a true new verb but through that mental talks days neither statement or report we're not going to buy down and you know what that report brought it brought God into the fiery furnace right what they say it brought God he wasn't it they just took them down and sold them in and then he goes jumps in with him now their report that they made in other words they was telling that King Oh King live forever we pray for you god bless you everything's great we said we're done been told on to bow down before idols and we're certainly not going to bow before you and really you know who their honor was it but how do you pronounce it comes a direct Meshach Abednego was actually worshiping well DeShazer is that the word is that the word for that which was really image of Daniel there's a pretty good time to tell the three Hebrew children what you mean Daniel one of you guys and you mean you're not going to bow down before Daniel it's a no we're gonna make a good report we don't bow before nobody making a report that's what we're getting at but what about it what is your report okay what about going over with us now - we're going over to number four brothers probably bypass the scripture we just quote them in Isaiah 53 it says something that's wonderful to me who had believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed now I don't read Bible like maybe others I'm sorry I read to try to understand what is being saying now he said who has believed our report so Isaiah had made a report we say oh that's just in there for us that's where most people read the Bible that's just in 9 for us to read who had believed our report would be good if you made it that personal but Isaiah had wrote 52 chapters he had made a great report in 52 chapters right he had spoke of the coming of the Messiah he spoke of the Virgin to conceive he had spoken of John and phorid of their 42 you know coming to introduce the Messiah he had covered the basic entire journey of mankind in 52 chapters so he'd made a pretty good report don't you think so that he went to all of those things are you listening - it's not just an insect see that's the way we studied the Bible to try to find her I never know I'm forgive me for being straight you said I never noticed it said that before that's okay but you know what you're done you just didn't read it right you didn't read it right it didn't change from one week to the next you know you didn't read it one time and then get a new edition and read it alright spine to what you're saying but think about it the Bible's always said that it never taught her Trinity no word right but we believe in it you know what we believe we believe it said dad and what about Isaiah standing there with all of that that he had wrote 52 chapters then what does he say who has believed our ripple work like the queen of sheba she'd heard the report she experienced a report Isaiah knew of God very prophet but then he was commissioned to write and he made his report like I said read through dark where you get to come into the virgin conceiving you get all of the things you get John coming in you get all other things happening sometime just read Isaiah and then when you do and you finish it up me so we know what Isaiah made a good report cuz we reported about one true and living God he reported about the coming of the Messiah he reported about John the Baptist he reported about all of the things to happen in the world and then he says who had believed I for now you know basically what people are the message read they don't believe who they don't read that who had believed our report they read the other part that's just a read up to that's the thought coming up to really they say because whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and then they go to brother Branham and take the arm of the Lord as will show it a minute where he says it's the power of God they're not interested in the report they're not interested in all it's been set up to their of 52 chapters about the coming of Jesus Christ the only interesting to find out what if the pile wanted the arm of the Lord you will find out what I'm talking about in a minute the arm of the Lord comes from were Isaiah had already covered it in 52 chapters because the arm of the Lord is the word of the Lord right and the word of the Lord was 52 chapter talking about the coming of the Lord they brought around his covers it and said and then we can read it in there you can take the book of Isaiah what is it 66 books in the Bible and Isaiah has 66 books in it he covers the beginning of the world he covered all the way to the future home make it a pretty good report in it but think about it now so he asked the question he said I've made a report about this I've taken all of the other Scrolls that their writings of things and I've concluded it by making a fifty two chapters report something pretty personal let me say it this way I've told you in 52 chapters what God told me to tell you is that Alright I told you what God told me to tell you he could say this that I said here is thus saith the Lord now what is thus saith the LORD know what you say that's why people won't do that you don't say that's at the Lord remembered us say if the Lord is what the Lord says right it's not what you say it's what the Lord says when you say the staff the Lord you said the said Samuel Dale you're supposed to be telling people what I say not what you think about what he's been saying right okay now getting the point to where we can go with it he covered the coming of Jesus Christ the Redeemer all of the things and then he makes a report he saw something personal then he makes a report it was only so go ahead to what we've got on number four what if you got it right there now watch his report who that believed our report into it and he's going to make a report from personal like I said I believe he believes 52 chapter don't you when he's summing up 52 chapters you don't read that away he's summing up 52 chapters he's going to make his report now watch him once you can cover Jesus Christ right to the G or he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground he have no form dark ominous calmness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him for not straight to the Messiah in the crucifixion huh God what good is your report if you don't have a report of the Messiah and the crucifixion the coming of Jesus Christ is well and good but was it doing you and I because look now or he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and his root out of dry ground he had no form nor comeliness Road around and said when he looked at him actually he said when they got to beating him he looked like a piece of hamburger meat that's just a story a statement because they beat him in 39 stripes and just ripped out everything and we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised we esteemed him not surely had for our griefs and carried our sorrows if we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities fifty two chapters are you following me and now he's going to make his own report 52 chapters of God telling him what will take place now he goes to prophecy straight in through the coming of the Messiah and the crucifixion are you with me about it see that's the way I think but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement our peace was upon him and with His stripes we were healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every man to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth it brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shearer's is dumb so he opened and not as a mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who had declared his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he had put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong are you winning we can go on reading the Scriptures but are you following what I'm saying after 52 chapters he said do you believe what I have said who has believed our report our hood that would be all the prophets right who had believed the prophets report then he makes his own report in spirit of prophecy and go straight to Calvary and describes Jesus Christ hanging on a tree and how he was done we could say I had a true report all the prophets have spoken this but only the height has been told and said now I want to describe to you what that spirit because the other prophets didn't necessarily cover the crucifixion huh they can because you can bring it in but Isaiah spends almost a whole chapter or even more right on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ he's making a report he sees something not physically he's not tired when it takes place he sees it by the Spirit of the Lord in prophecy and what's closer would you need for anything you understand what I'm getting at you believe that what Isaiah said came to pass he wasn't dying run you wasn't done you're only taking a report you got the writings of Matthew Mark Luke and John huh which that's writings of Matthew Mark Luke and John that's a true report right but I wasn't there he wasn't there we need something more personal than to just to say the report of somebody else now quote the Prophet he said has it come off the pages into your heart what about your report if your report is that he's one of the Trinity one of the three gods is your report that he is just a oneness star what is your report and do you have a witness we have a witness what is your report I believe it cause the Prophet said it well and good that's not your report that's a prophets report I believe it called God said it that's the God's report what is your is it simple not deliberately done what I've done on asking you about your experience until two or three messages preaching parts about it but never fully answering any of the thoughts but just to get it into your mind the brother Dale I don't understand you because I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior it's his business from their own it's good for you see why it's so important to hear the truth the Bible doesn't say if you hear hydrous are part truth are lies it is to save you you see why it's very very important what you hear well God knows my heart as to where we're at we'd be in good shape he didn't know it I've always told you sounds odd for a preacher he believes in one true Living God but sometimes it would be nice if they was a Trinity because maybe somewhere in the channel between here and dark of the three of them whatever might could help me out you know and if not get all the way to the head man too worried how to destroy me one more year Sydney I agree we but is it right is it right see we know he's just one true and living God when Isaiah ended up in the twelfth verse or Darfur I will divide him a portion with the Great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors any by the sin of many and made intercession for transgressions what about your report I've asked this question over and over to you he say I've accepted Jesus Christ that's wonderful but why is it that people who come to the altar and accept Jesus Christ why does it not go on to bringing them to salvation well they're foolish virgins will not necessarily because remember until you get to Holy Ghost you can fall now after you get to Holy Ghost you don't fall but you can fall in justification you can fall in sanctification and remember word rejecters go to hell so that depending on what you do it right - who had believed our report you know what we read where brother branham said it off the message God's provided way number five you want to pull it up and just by accepting him what only do God's got to vindicate back that he has accepted you that's the thing you can accept him but then if he accepts you listen stay there until he does accept you so evidently it's not as I accept him he's saying stay there until he accepts you right well I accepted him what else you want me to do that's what the Baptist say right that's what the prophet and say about them see they say well they Brown believed God what else you think you could do that's fine that's true but what God dude Abraham and God giving you a sign that you have been accepted or you like the Queen of Sheba that you're believing unto because that's what she was doing when she heard the report she was believing untrue she had nothing personal to prove to anybody but when she went down and experienced it you know in the court of law you can't give your sight then where'd you go up her and say I'd say brother Colley told me he saw Sean John they say forget it forget it that's hearsay cousin went to two miles if you don't see something personal you can't witness to it right okay he said you can accept him but then if he accepts you stay right there until he does attention and then when he does he seals you into his kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you say well I've accepted him but as he accepted you what do you mean I believe the message I believe the Bible it's well and good but that's the Queen of Sheba with her own true reported even she said I heard until went something personal to her and Isaiah we used that because he moved up into a greater realm he had all the background of 52 chapters and then he says who had believed our report well then once it was already made like I said very little it said back down through that coming of a virgin and every time but you know what I'm getting happened to what I'm saying that most of your prophets never talked to the virgin birth most your prophets never talked of the coming Messiah you know in letter words and thing most of them were just timewise and what God was doing and the different things were taking place but as they have summed it all up by bringing it into his what God had given him then he makes a report if you're saying what somebody else says where's the Holy Ghost involved so we went on to give the one when Jehovah Jireh says don't look at yourself look at your lamb God don't accept you he accepted the lamb he said well I accepted him and he accepted me now I accepted the lamb worldwide now because that means he accepted me what is your understanding of the lamb what if you rejected the lamb what if you rejected the lamb I don't mean nothing like I've always said I've always told it this way and always believed it everybody in the Old Testament took a lamb up drove it down on the altar so that's my sacrifice that done away with my sins they went home with her sin no he don't understand they wrote down the dishes were throwing throwing throwing soap and he's sinned or forgiven not if it ain't sincerity then God got tired of all of those signs didn't he you get tired of hearing me quote that scripture I guess God got tired of man and his this is mine good well you know who that fits under if it's under Cain and what did he say Cain said Lord I've done what I've done you take it or leave it well we know what happened he left it you see where we get into that though it's just me I would put it brother Tala I've been a Christian a long time praise the Lord now quote Paul have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe may I ask you another question have you received the Holy Ghost since you come into message when I wonder you're talking about too many Holy Ghost know this asking a simple question that's what Paul was all run upon believers that would believe in Jesus was the Christ and teaching it and he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so it evidently is not when you believe when you get the Holy Ghost it's when he accepts you we need except your lamb then he gives you something right is that true circumcision number seven is the top of the Holy Ghost and God gave Abraham a circumcision sign after he had accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange land I heard he had accepted God on the promises and got up went on come on and if you need from brother Branham oh I've accepted him and maybe you need where he says but he gave God the Son of God gave Abraham the son of circumcision - what was our number eight God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation of his recognition of his faith you see your you want to lay onto me all the time you don't listen I said I kept asking the question he's have accepted God but I asked a simple question as he accepted you well I'm in the message now we're in a time where we can light things down kind of a little hard and hurt with it but there's no need of hurting with it this true what about these people that's preached this message for 40 or 50 years and now turned away some of you know nice personally and you would have never and some of them maybe was instrumental in bringing you into the message was he a believer I liken that to one thing that I love brother branham in his way you know Balin we want to talk about bad guy and everything else available you know that brother branham said he wouldn't in too bad a shape today until he met Elijah now you make sense a lot sure which one okay nothing problem when Balaam was confronted by a true prophet then is when he showed his color could I like the statement right around said he said to be a prophet in Israel was a great thing you realize Balaam had a record probably of all of his prophecies you know that he spoke of the Messiah you know he spoke of the coming of the Lord by them in his own writings so he wouldn't a false prophet until he met a genuine prophet now watch what I'm saying a genuine prophet or the hour because Balaam would have been a prophet until then but then when he witnessed and would not father elijah he became a false prophet that's how simple it is what about the preachers this message preached 50 years and swore screamed and hollered at you that you had to believe a prophet he had to this that the other and you're lost if you don't you've been there and today where are they then may I say it without hurting feelings were they making a true report all the way down through that and then turned around made a false report always a little something wrong all along they just never faced a real truth you realize what makes a man turn against this message is the fact some work something he rejects it and by rejecting it maybe a simple fact of you saying you believe it in my life is placed upon me believe it you know all you got to show you is what my life is not whole thing is not based on this never now y'all look like y'all make too much of that profit see that's how easy it get started until it destroys the people but you ask them today have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior oh yes it will where's your evidence what you mean where's your evidence I'm a quoting brother branham well brethren what can we do abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness that's a good actor statement right then you know that's the truth if it's handled correctly what about when you inject some ID or thought is God going to give you the baptism of the holy God now remember I do not believe you understand this brother Dale I do not believe that God is going to accept your faith and give you the baptism of the holy ghost and then one day take it away from you now I don't believe that so there's something wrong somewhere right well you're saying them fellas never was saved saves one word born-agains another word saved is an honest confession of a heart and believing it and saying it salvation is when God gives you the seal of circumcision God gave Abraham the sign of circumcision showing he had been accepted right has he given you the baptism of the holy ghost to show you're accepted now don't jump hollering I'm in the message don't go that way okay I believe everything I probably said like I said don't come in my office and say I believe everything to probably see it because I might bring up some things that I don't think you believe okay so she asked me a question I'm gonna answer it you think I'm a dirty dog a hard lean person I try to do the best not spraying lies not God please get that off of me get it off of me I know what everybody thinks they think I'm hard and mean that comes I'm arrogant I'm just an I'm trying to save your soul we get on that other side you will thank me for it to try to tell you the truth you realize what you could say you can say I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior and every day of your life have accepted Jesus Christ as my savior I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior get on the end of it and find out he never accepted you has he given you the sign of circumcision I steal ours where we go I'm in the message I believe the Prophet you want we name a few of these gadgets but only for 50 years and where are they today every brother do we've got a few years think you're the only ones got it I'm the only one that I know this guy is that any problem I'm the only one I know this guy now everybody else got to say the same thing right if they won going out of Georgia I'm sorry y'all gotta move my wife better head to Tennessee no there's one going and I'm it right no but I said oh no it's true then he gave Abraham the sign of circumcision showing he had accepted his believing and he given you the baptism of the Holy Ghost showing he's accepted you're believing now anything that you name I started one evidence Satan can impersonate I'm not against it I believe in gifts I believe in signs and wonders I believe in an emotional thing I believe in crying I believe in shouting I believe in all the works of God in everybody that's born again doesn't have the same or you call it mechanical isms or whatever what would be the right word to be used in other words one speaking tongues one shout one cry one do this one's out of the other I believe in that you tell me brother Dale I received the Holy Ghost brother Tatum I remember his experience he said I was sitting out under a tree and he said it was like raindrops just falling all over me you know what I believe that he said we're brother Dale these are that people go wrong then we're saying that you need to have an experience remember and experience is what you live through a sensation is what you can have anytime an experience is something you live through but wonder groped around safe the baptism of the holy ghost and watch him without a sensation now what's he saying show me where he ever said the baptism of the Holy Ghost without an experience well but you don't understand experiencing since I don't know you don't understand experience and sensation not the same than God now quote the Prophet just remember you jump up and down shouting holler he said just make sure you walk straight when you come to hell have you accepted your faith and giving you the baptism when the Holy Ghost the new birth there's never been a baby born that the mother didn't have an experience and the baby had fun right we're going through the things that went through but I like that where he said without a sensation so you're saying well I just don't have to do nothing it's just what I believe Abraham believe but God done something else what about it yeah but you're trying to tear down everything I've ever believed if I can turn down once you believe me I'll quote brother I'll he said why don't you go apart let brother Dale talk you out of what you think you believe you remember that real you know if I can talk you out of it you know what it means you can have it it is that special so you say you're against me I'm not against somebody hey I have to face these in the notes when I write them so whatever you say is your experience was it the new verb or a sensation and remember but a random said I don't believe in stillborn babies so I don't believe in the new birth coming without an experienced sensation is stimulation upon your senses etc so he said this even the Holy Ghost without a sensation that's been running to the ground the see dark the prophet said he didn't believe in sensation he never said he didn't believe in sensation he believed his experience then plenty of sensations no we're okay but are we willing to accept correction you know we're good old backdash it's been 50 years since eyes are I still well remember it I can't deny the father because if I deny the father I'll deny the son you know the Bible says in heaven feet you're not about you drive sir maybe if I deny the father and honor that's why I've got to have Lord Jesus I got our Father Son Holy Ghost in my baptism because if I deny the father it means I deny the son so I've got to go that away is that true or is that a lie or may I quote brother branham deal I what about all of these anointed ones around the world today that great signs and wonders are happening in their ministries but yet they won't accept the truth what's wrong what God knows what our brother's health now quoted random people will say it's better to go on in the framework of organized religion to serve God then they're not serving at all that's how the church age boo now finish the rest of it to believe Satan's lie is to serve Satan there's going to come a time when we're going to be presented to us then we can keep a church as long as we just not change but just back up a little bit and just change things you see the Bible said to be wise as a serpent harmless into doing I'll tell you something that I've been doing for over 30 years deliberately watching my word you think my wording is tough I'm deliberately staying away from calling people homosexuals we are etc etc why come on sure if you think they end up on what we do and I remind you of a few weeks ago when I titled a sermon examine in yourself that was the title of the sermon examining your sails because it's what the Bible said examine yourself see whether unifight you know what they pull us off the internet until we protested all right what'd you call it Facebook true or what all those things like our ears are starting to do it Joe Tim can tell you they pulled it off because that could be examining you know like feeling of people so even that word phrase brought up a red flag and a jerk us off till they clarified what we were talking about do we've got to be wiser serpent Harmon to do it ain't on compromising nobody will just tell it like it is formal setting wordings as wise as i can to keep from being caught because i know what they're doing and that's proof right back dark of what I've told you all along they will do to us they'll take your words and tire you to pieces so I read a lot I come out here to motor state when I said one of these days the black lights going to fight and die like flies they could pull us off the internet for that but when I read and say brother Branham sat down they can't publish because I'm saying what he says hey we were in Jeffersonville 1968 I guess it was in the World Council of Churches ordered the Brenham Tabernacle to give them a church age book had a court order know why go to vada asked us we'd settle my thousand of them right but you can't use that you can't pick up something that's got william branham written on it and use it in a court of law you think they ain't smart and know what they're doing they got a court order and got a church age book you know why they can take that church age book to court what about Brennaman brother Branham and all of it saying about colored people and it's that the other they could get him for a hate crime if I'm reading him they got to go back to him I do a lot here you said well what's your whole story whole story is one time what are we depending upon to say that we're saved today don't start it off we believe in the message but then I'll just refer it right back to these it's believed in 50 years and where are they okay brother Randall what is the evidence the Holy Ghost go ahead with number eight a what is the evidence and I want you to read this with plain common sense today I was talking with a good friend dr. Lee Vail who is present now and he's quite a theologian so we usually have some out some pretty good discussions on the scripture verse very small he asked me one time what I thought about the initial evidence of the oligos was he speaking in Congress it's been many years ago I said no can't see that he said neither do I so but I've been calling he said what would you think would be an evidence here's your prophet it's off the message broken sister in 1964 I said the most perfect evidence I can think of in love so we got to talking on that and I thought that sounded pretty good so I just held that if a man has got love what about a prophet having to be corrected and admit he was corrected but one day the Lord and a vision straightened me out he said that the evidence of a spirit was those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues when it's receiving the word can you receive the word yes it fits what I believe right sarcastic okay what is it true and you tell me you want to go and leave websites and see all these now that are saying Bertrand was wrong and we're wrong and all this wrong we'll just call from we're doing it you'll own the simple question I believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed they run said you can pull it up if you want to but let me find it there will be number 10 which is on the sixth seal we have to believe our report and to whom the word of the Lord is revealed leave the report in the arm of the Lord is revealed the arm the Word of God is revealed but if power power go to God power to God spoke no word of God ain't no power it's all fake because remember there's only two powers they're really enable one there's what God and what he permits the devil the house so don't go with power go with the true evidence that your prophet even said he had to be corrected it's whether or not the spirit in you let me I add one word to that without you babe only that the word let me use this one little word whether or not the spirit II and you continually agrees for the word because I'll tell you these is preached fifty years said it's that Greek we heard but they didn't continually agree with or because it come down to something if you want to know what anybody's about evidence or what it got is just take the word to them like I said you Pentecostals what was your ideas look them in huh I just earn your spirit yeah what did the Prophet say how do you check the spirit of an individual no matter who is you checking by the word hey come on you be sweet lovable and everything else but you just keep nailing that word down keep tapping that word and just keep hitting that word it'd be like the ladies you know well I don't think I need to just you know I think I just cut my heart paint my face God knows my heart I've accepted him as my savior and he knows my heart you won't tell god damn remember you are telling God that when you speak it out of your mouth the Queen of Sheba was making a report of what she saw it witness what about you and I come on musician the arm of the Lord is a revealed word it is not letters on the page the word may I quote right around them I got them laying here the word is not just to say the gospel the gospel is the Word of God presented by someone who has experienced that gospel or else is what somebody else said what about your experience I believe every word probably says who was one wooden said he could run around he said I downtown now I say I doubt that now here's my statement from the whole time John made over 50 years now I've tried to make one report to this church that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and this prophets message is right remember Wednesday night remember Wednesday night when I was preaching that the headstone to the church is the revealed word which is this message revealed to you and I because the cornerstone was a revealed word about Jesus Christ this is what the disciples never received because they didn't understand malice um Matthew 24 come on Jesus preached six healed and none of the disciples knew anything about what it said so what is the headstone the revealed word all of the revealed word those disciples made a true report you agree the faith of the Father is a good report but they never witnessed the opening of the full entire word but you and I have laying before us in this message of the hour the Word of God if this is not the headstone than you're admitting or saying there's something else has got to take place you're saying there's something else to come won't you show me even the advocates that that's part of what the prophet call because come on like I told you about the brother sitting at the house that time and said run around swept off the foundation we got to build a building I said would you do me one thing one favor would you tell me something types of future home because bread around them is preached all the way to the future home and described it to a team of where everything was out so if you're going to tell me something you tell me out pi-star well he just kind of left no he knew they wouldn't know neither argument over what I done made my statement I made a report about this message 50-something you and my report is when the bride of Jesus Christ comes to the realization of who she is I'm quoting brother Branham and what she's here for she will be an investable army that's how the church age book that's my report that I've done for 50 years I see in the ministry the brothers is just preached recently laid the Bob the Dilys of the era I see them making a report and the report is about the body of Jesus Christ the bride of Jesus Christ I'm glory in that they've catching home and you said we don't think it knowed it before you go play with all you want to somewhere else I've waited for somebody to come and say I see it I've had brothers to come here and soir from this very pulpit that they saw what I was talking about and brother day all the message he brought is perfect and not why did they leave without giving an answer of why they were leaving well I know the answer they just don't like your attitude now show me anywhere in the Bible that an attitude is you mean you don't believe it I'll remind you a dumb don't key now what kind of an attitude that he have let me ain't even alive a human being get it correct to the profit well they just don't like the way you preach because you pretty so much that you preach like that you're the only one that's got it I'm the only one that knows I got it anybody want to argue the point but you see around the world now is picking up some of these ministers come in coming in or picking up some are still preaching six and seven messages you know what I mean by that it's the old days Macy's 50 years ago messages and not seeing anything personal the lies for massachusett was grown of these brothers each one of them was talking of a witness of a personal experience may I give them my hand but I don't believe it well why don't you come and show me where it's wrong all I've ever preached is a personal experience a personal witness of Jesus Christ living in our hearts because outside of that you're saying what somebody else said who has believed our report now listen and you'll know the scripture who had believed our report into whom is the arm of the Lord revealed who is the Word of God revealed - there's your evidence for the Holy Ghost there's your evidence of whether you've been accepted or not well you mean brother tense I got a walk out today you'd say I wouldn't accept no I saying you are you never said nobody left his church turning the word down I said they made your own statement I walking out the door I don't have to make a statement let's leave our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the whom is the Word of God now may I finish the message I started winter Steve while worried about the headstone until you see for sure to the cornerstone and a little worried about the headstone because there's no way to understand and be like brother branham coming out to earn ohio river and say the headstone here you know what it was but there's no way that mankind could ever get what he's talking about because they surely didn't even get what he talking about after 50 years or something like 30 years or something trying to preach but you're not looking which I'm looking for this message to be revealed because you tell me one time in this Bible that has not been revealed a way of the Prophet no problem you see other day certain things this kind of take place then are you going to tell me the faith of the fathers don't agree with it are you going to tell me all of this back behind doesn't agree you weren't listening Isaiah preached 52 chapters and then he declared Jesus Christ in his crucifixion in the 53rd chapter he had everything behind him and then he made his Proclamation if he ever did they started okay you got your ideas you're a human being I have never rejected what anybody said about this message and the things I've always they said well that's your business but will it fit on the Bible stay oh yeah anybody have a need what about it he accepted your report I didn't know I had to make one you did an ion and I report has got to comply with every scripture come by here [Music] he's more market
