and delivered us from destruction so thank you for it we love you and we just appreciate it all in Jesus name so we're going to first Peter 1 22 23 then we're going to the Leviticus we're going to try to pick up a little point to review especially this past Wednesday's message make sure you understand where we're we're you know what we're trying to bring alright so we appreciate it maybe in another week or two we'll get off of this message I said I was gonna try to finish up the message today but I won't be able to it'll be for a while and brother Forney be with us Wednesday so just pray for him verse 22 seeing you purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever amen now you remember our point this past Wednesday as you're turning to Leviticus we we're talking about the new birth the new birth has always been ever aged every time the new birth is the birth of the word and if not explain something to me tell me what the new birth is well I just believe God well he's the word without the alive word without the Holy Ghost you can have the letter in your heart all of your days your life and still die and go to hell because you're missing it but with the revelation of that word you cannot die all right so what is the new birth it's the birth of the word okay we hit it Wednesday we'll get back to it the Lord willing in another week or something what is the headstone if the cornerstone is the new birth and it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you then would not the headstone be the revelation of the word that would be sewn into the last days right because see the cornerstone and the headstone can't be different because the headstone actually become the cornerstone of the church and it comes through the church ages as the cornerstone Jesus Christ be in that cornerstone all right and then comes out to be the headstone so it'd be more the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what I thought we believe you know okay we'll get to that in a minute now we go to Leviticus 25 verse 8 that's out number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years in the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years now that represents the church ages the seven church ages alright now listen it is in the seventh church age that the rapture comes but you cannot stay under a seven and think about eternity right as long as you're dealing with a seven you're in time okay so now read what we're talking about that's number seven sabbaths of years remember there's a jubilee over seven years remember they don't jubilee ever in other words you work six days rested the seventh all of that was tied into it now look and that's number seven Sabbath's of years into these seven times seven years and that's in the space of the seven Sabbath's of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years okay know what then shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement so you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land alright a trumpet has to come under the seven to proclaim the eighth alright keep that in mind as we go along now watch verse 10 so you know you've done seven sevens it's 49 okay a jubilee a release every seven years now watch and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now the said we tried to we've been trying for quite a while to get things in the right line up for us to understand where we're at and what's taking place and the day in the hour that we're living and to recognize your day and it's message all right now to recognize your and it's message we should know that we're in the end of all things that should be the natural but worse the message the how is it that we talk about Wednesday night that you find out whether a man is true or not what's the message that follows we don't throw off on anybody we don't make no light of anybody or what but CEO Roberts Billy Graham wonderful they were the two sodomite messengers that will in time that went down to Sodom and come out all right they were great they done their work okay thank God for it but were was either one of them that had a message oh you can get some books and things out on Billy Graham and what he taught on this you can get some books out on the old Roberts and what he taught on this that of the other all right but worse the message that they brought and remember the quote we gave you that brother branham said it don't matter if you have signs and wonders but if you continue with the same old message he said don't fool with it even though you have signs and wonders but you continue with the same old message what would it be today for us to want to sat down and listen to a message on the Trinity you know you know what I mean someone trying to prove the Trinity Rock we yet having signs and wonders very deceptive but you're out of the world see because there's got to be forever age and time there's got to be a message come forth all right we've been driving at that for a long time trying to get you to follow the thought because knowing we were headed toward this form here to try to express you know the things all right in the Bible you had a Jubilee over seven years most people don't realize that they only go to the 49 and up to the 50 okay all right but you got to release and be glad to go through the Scriptures matter of fact if you'll back up in verse 25 you'll find it's dealing with the sevens all right that's why you have your seventh-day Adventist people who claimed the Sabbath or the baptism of the whole to go is to keep the Saturday or the seventh day alright see you had a release there in the Bible every seven years and it would go seven sevens is 49 and then it would come to a 50th Jubilee time all right so there's a release in each church age these church age has a release there was there was a Salvation to each age of people but if you'll go back now I'm giving you this where you think about it and you see what I'm driving out when you're studying that and you look at the Jubilee on the seventh or the release ever seven years if you'll read your Bible and I'll be glad to show you these things they were stipulations went as long as you were dealing with a seven and as long as you and I are dealing with a seven we're still hooked in time now we're not talking about an eighth day this or that or the other of the old doctrine back in about two seventy one two or three four I wish stood that just as much as we're standing it today but there's one thing for sure they talk then we were already in the eighth day we've done Pais to millennium we've done PI we've done done in today today I said no it looks like we're dying you know look like we've got a lot of problems so we can't be in that all right and see trying to get the point to the people to see what the truth was about it okay all right but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul your soul is eternal as it'll ever be which means it's already your soul and I told them then your soul quoting brother Branham has already entered into the eighth day spiritually not eight they physically we're still physically we're dying as long as we're dying we're still under a seven but by the new birth that you receive your soul is eternal which is already into the eighth day spiritually not physically now so gonna be silly listen all right and see as long as we're under time we're hooked to it okay it doesn't matter what you want to think about this so in each church AJ was a release every seven years there was a release every seven years if you were in bondage all right now we won't go through all of that if you'd be glad to go with it but see it's not slavery that's what everybody thinks they dealing with slavery it's not slavery in the Bible they ain't even talking about slavery it's when a Hebrew buys a Hebrew it's not slavery you can't use the natural type of slavery in thing it doesn't work because see even the children of Israel had slaves right you know Oh Hagar was a slave about person see you don't go with slavery that's what we want to get we don't get in their type this stuff and don't go with it it's when a Hebrew buys a Hebrew it's when I oh brother Lewis money and I can't pay it and I go in bondage to him and work for him long enough to pay that debt and at the end of that seven years that it was there in the Old Testament then they become a release I could go home but you don't read you Bible read your Bible when a person let another one go free like that they didn't send them home empty-handed read your Bible that's wonderful you gave them provisions and things to help them to get started again cause it all was speaking of eternal life all right so there was a release every 7 years but you went to 77249 and then you turn around started right back over what because it couldn't come to a jubilee of a 50 all right his wave was bringing out another there's no record that Israel ever did you know never did hold that 50th why cause it wasn't gonna let them people go free that's just plain language they held it all right but see you go and if you'll notice in your riding in the scripture under those sevens if a man went into bondage now going to bondage brother Louise to pay my debt if I take my wife and go in with her and sell out to him when I get to my times up I go free my wife goes free but if the master give you a wife she can't go free her and her offspring would stay under the master see the stipulations they can't be no rapture in the Church ages we got to get to a number 8 to find a rapture the main thing I want to write I want to find because see that says as we read here now the Jubilee will sound on the 49th to declare the coming 50 it's another Irish word it's what people can't follow and I've tried my best to explain if I need to go over that let me know I'll be glad to try to cover it what you see under that 49 but went into bundage with my wife she come on you gave me a wife my wife stayed they stipulations they kept was tied to time there's been stipulations in the church ages there's no change of the body in any church age right so now how we're gonna get to that place where they can be a change and worse the messenger and the message that goes with that that's all I've tried to do is get to see the man because you see under the 49 you had stipulation but now reading the tenth verse over again when it comes to the fiftieth everything goes free you can't keep it in matter if I went into bondage and he gave me a wild all that goes free under a 50 there's no limitations under the 50 because that's the type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why it says in the Bible when the day of Pentecost was fully come see that come to a fifty not a forty nine long as we're in time we're hooked we've got to find out how to get from time to eternity all right then we got to find the messenger to get us from time to eternity then we got to find his message to get us some time to eternity all right are you looking for another messenger who's the messenger to come to declare that you believe are you looking for another prophet to come okay we've got that song heaven there's no profit to come I hope you're not blinded to that of what I've just said not looking for another messenger okay we believe the messenger has already come to proclaim as we covered our Wednesday night this is the introducing of the headstone the prophets it will review these in a minute but now worse the message what's the message of eternal life well we're just born to get believe we're ready to go you know you're just like a Pentecostal you shopping without the horns and forgetting the whole message what's the message what is the message of us trying to bring out there Winston what is it in the Bible that light had never shined upon what was it during the Scriptures it was lighted never said like I told you if you listen to Wade what are you talking about the son of man Matthew Mark Luke and John yes they wrote of the son of man they told of the Son of Man but show me anything Paul and Peter them ever wrote about it in their messages after them they never wrote of the Son of Man because they didn't understand it even Peter when he said when Jesus said who demands don't watch it when Pete when Jesus said to Peter who the man say i the son of man am right what is that Matthew ok wait don't read his name we don't plan these things ok all right who the man say either son of man look what Peter said Peter said dark the Christ the Son of the Living God Jesus didn't ask him who the son of the Living God was he asked him who the son of man was in other words implying the language jesus said to Peter when he said that's the one they say he said ok Peter you're in the lineup you're in the word but said you didn't get what I asked I asked who's the son of man you answered who the son of God is and said I'll build my church up on that son of God remember he died son of man right heroes son of God under their Pentecost into the church son of God is about give some of the Holy Ghost and Jesus said I'll build my church on that we said I'm coming back in the end time and I'll bring the rest of it to you don't worry about it what was it that mankind knew nothing of the sort of man like I've told you sure we talked about it in the Baptist Church son of man has always been resurrection jesus said I am the resurrection it's always been the resurrection all right now but being that see where is that resurrection there's got to be a message all right we'll get back to this here in a minute if we can back in Leviticus cause brother Branham was the one that said it on the daniel seventy weeks he said in 1977 would be the 70s you believe from according to Leviticus 25 eight he said making exactly thirty four hundred thirty years he knew exactly to the year he knew exactly did the time all right so worth the message where was it we were trying to talk about wins t I mean you have Sunday excuse me every Wednesday here I get my days Wednesday all right what was it in the Bible at lighted nut shondo the seals of Matthew 24 Peter Paul none of them preached anything about the seals show me in the Bible come on they never preached anything about the seven seals Jesus preached those seals enlighted not shined on that until the end time all right so now then what have we been covering what are we trying to get across the prophet and his ministry and what he come to do had to come in two phases or stages are you listening two phases or two stages every one you want to call it stage one 327 Church age book this message of Malachi for Luke 17 will burn will will turn the hearts of the father's back to the children right phase one he said the messengers gonna do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children by he said to reveal the seven thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals so what his brother Browns message it was not to fight to the fathers that was restoration to be returned what is brother ins message the opening of the seven seals and the message from their own out come on listen to what I'm saying if you can see it and open up the Bible to where to be a beautiful picture little Ron's messaged acquired in the forty nine the messenger in Leviticus comes in two forty-nine to declare the Jubilee the next year brother Branham come to declare and turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers Amen that was what he had to do he had to preach us back to the faith of the Father but there on the Ohio River it didn't say your message is to turn the hearts of the children but that's melikhaya for look at the two parts right around got a cover of Malachi 4 then he's got to cover revelation 10 7 right he's got to turn the hearts of the children back then he's got to bring the message of the opening of the seven seals he said well what does that mean to me where is your messenger to take you to eternal life that's all I've asked that's all I'm asking you where's the message and the messenger to take us to eternal life if it's not already sounded then we've got to find it somewhere somebody's got to come forward with it right well I'm not looking for somebody to come forward with it I've never done that since I walked into this message I saw what he was coming to proclaim he had a message this man stood with a message here I've asked you to look at the titles of the sermons after this the seals was preached this look at the titles of the sermon everything after the seals broke went into eternal life the ones that matter to me that's what I'm saying you losing your you're losing the very salvation that the prophets message brings by being so sarcastic and includes me of being sarcastic or hateful or arrogant or intelligent or this out of the other when I've always tried to explain one time eternal life they had to be a messenger of eternal life Jesus Christ had to come and bring the message of eternal life right each church age had a messenger with a special message of eternal life for that age look at Martin Luther he was already a convert of a Christianity you'd call it he was a what a monk or what you call him a no guy in the ranks and all and what but one day what's eternity strike a man a man is dealing when crying out and trying to repent and trying to to do the penances and do the things of the Catholic Church and all of this over and over and over trying to say this self and God struck her into his heart and said the just shall live by faith that took Martin Luther to eternal life in his soul but he couldn't take him fleshly because it was not a danger time but he took his soul to eternal life John Wesley come along with a message of sanctification that message took his soul into eternal life the Pentecostals come with the restoration of the gifts and people of this message life and make fun of it big names will say oh then Pentecost was all false I challenge that on the basis of God's Word you show me anything false in the Bible come on church it's time to settle down and think about what we're doing what was brother branham's message he had to do the work of restoration back right because we've got so far away from the truth of it until that melech ha part had to be full filled but that was part one to turn the hearts of the children back now words the revelation 10 7 that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God shall be revealed where's the mystery the mystery is this message brought by the Prophet in Malachi there was a lot of mysteries come on there was a lot of mysteries the mixture of one God that mr. water baptism the mystery of the thing little running brings them out and shows him those mysteries was there but it was under the faith of the fathers but worse the mysteries that ISKCON the boring mystery that is to contain all mysteries all right are you following me so what happened see the whole key and the things is what I was trying to get across means me not finishing it up at the end I know I spend so much time trying to clarify something to you until a lot of times I don't have a point the time to get what I wanted to bring and then I try to bring out selling people well I fixed the intellect well how it wanted your profit bringing this in let we get to it in a minute What did he say because what I'm trying to get now watch part 1 turn the hearts of the children back when brother Branham went beyond the curtain of time what did he say he said will Paul be judged for what he preached they said yes or ever the angel said yes and those brother Brian said and I preached just what Paul preached and all of those are hollered out and we're resting upon it 1962 reads spoken word is the original seed read it or listen to it you call me an intellect you called me of this or that you say well your teacher then get me underneath well do what your teacher says I got tired of hearing 1 plus 1 equal to didn't you finally I got the two plus two equals four hey I'm doing pretty good and then I really got smart when you get on up into the hundreds and the thing cuz we begin to understand and we used to do a little thing in school goodness you know six seven eight years old I know y'all didn't do it because y'all wouldn't that dumb we used to do a little thing in school and that was to see who could count the fastest or multiply the best right and we go through you know two plus two equal four four four four Hey thank you twenty four is always going on who could count to the hundred two quickest well you know I found out one day how to count to 100 before the rest of them did of course they didn't like it cuz they thought I was a smart aleck right you say well ok now let's that's right now let's count to a hundred ok you start I'm gonna give you a head start go ahead and count to a hundred I mean okay you got ninety one foot hey he shortcutting know what you can do it just say pot of peas did you hear me pot of peas it means in the pot over a hundred well even though he could count 99 plus one and that was smarter than the rest I will do it I come up with a pot of these then just cut the whole thing out do you understand I'm trying to illustrate the answer is in the message and the message has already been brought but it's so simple we're not looking for another messenger to come no cuz we've already had the seventh church age messenger he's already brought his message and like I told you go out through the fields and just read the titles of the sermons future home Chrysler mister God revealed on Titan of God mighty God unveil who the smell charity things that are to be read all the titles none of them deals with eight I mean with sevens in the time all of them goes into eternity brother Branham coming to Christ a mystery you remember what he said now listen he said if you have any questions on the seals and things where these they go you ain't listening to the message go back to seal Buckley read it he didn't say that he said go to Christ a mystery read it he said go to Christ the mystery why because in Christ the mystery was a whole entire thing come on Church it's just it's time to quit playing with our silly little things and and listen to the word the Prophet said to ever messenger come at the end of the age where do you think he'd come where did Paul come where did iranians where do these come at the prophet said it comes the end of the age well I've been Paul's met Paul comes in late in the age he come right up here and when he got right here and witnessed a minute now if Paul come up here then he's bringing the message to some earner see what I said and you don't listen Paul came at the end of the age into what age we read it to you Wednesday well what's that got to do it where does your messenger come because remember your messenger has to call you forth into the message of the age if you're not called forth into the message of the age you're in bad shape now let me tell it to you like this no church age was ever in time the age is there but he turn life is in every church age if the Holy Ghost in every age listen what about it where is your messenger at that you've got to be called unto now is that the scripture verse number nine preach here 1971 I read the scripture going beyond man's camp and the scripture says go unto him you realize you bet you've got to be called out of an age to be the bride if you're the bride's you're called out of the age physically speaking we're still in the age right we're in Lady ousia right but spiritually speaking by the baptism of the Holy go your soul is just as eternal if that ever be and you've already been called out of the age go out unto him that's what the scripture says called out of the age into eternal life sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus but we're still here see that's what you this that's all you get we're doing here we're going to be here until the rapture change the moment or not twinkling eye right but we got to be called out of the age how can you be called out via ijen to be in the age oh that's right again we called out your being an ignorant oh so you burr you birdbrain runs around and around trying to figure things out I know you got to do is just ask God was he in the age physically yeah he was in time which spiritually he was the god of glory right physically he aged spiritually he could not age right so what about it one things days we're gonna get it it's gonna strike us see the messenger comes at the end of the age now if Paul what message I've got him wrote down there so if you want him what age was Paul to be the messenger of I mean I got brother branham's word okay we can look at the pyramid we can see we can talk but what age was Paul to be the messenger of the church in Ephesus right now how could he come at the end of Ephesus and bring the message to Ephesus he bring the message to Smyrna right so then get away from looking at things and can't figure it out take what God says the Prophet emphasized over and over through the church age series that the messenger coming to the end of the age in an overlap between these church age and an overlap run that into your computer some down you get home an overlap between their ages that's what made it work cause listen Jesus said the porter you remember that in the Gospels the porter stands in the door and calls the door ain't going to open let's that porters to him during cold snoring the porter called in the sheep ear who was the porter sure he was typing into the Lord Jesus Christ his own ministry right but who's the porter for each church age the messenger of that age that was what was wrong see the people thought intellectually that Luther was preaching to destroy the Catholic Church and if what they tried to do no making region history illegal I mean they burnt down churches they don't every time I think Luther said that's not right say well you told us to get out and get away from him he said yeah but that's not right I don't do any good to burn the church is to get rid of them things that's inside of you they burnt building thinking that was what Martin Luther talked now he talked of just shall live by faith he taught the new birth to come into the heart of mankind to set that man free you never taught burning the churches and doing this out of the other there's people in this nation especially back in the old days of the seventies in time why they they go by church they just ain't going in that place you go didn't I ah I've got two old spirits in there and although spirit was in the person who say at night that's what always made me unpopular okay still I am so I don't worry about it oh there's the truth what am i concerned about the buildings you know this used to be an old store well they are there amongst over got any more bad spirits in them well you've been sitting in an old store building for a long time how many bad spirits have you got out of yes okay but listen Church the messenger always came I was trying to explain it to you Wednesday night he always came at the end of the age okay now explain to me where your messenger is and who he is and what's to take place under that form of line or thought of the messenger come at the end of the age did Paul come at the end of Ephesus or the beginning which one well what that matter to me if he came to the end of the age look what you got one two three four five six seven but if he becomes down here and brings it correctly you've got one two three five six seven eight hey hey the number eight we were using well ago the number eight signifies eternity right that's Leviticus number eight signifies eternity Paul coming to end of Ephesus then he would bring in the message to Simona what you see you won't listen to somebody preaching and then when I read it you've already got your mind so shut off until you won't listen to what even the Prophet says Paul came at the end of Pentecost and brought the message to Ephesus as the age began to dwindle Iranians came at the end of that Ephesus age and brought the message to the Samoan age now if I get them majors wrong in the nines wrong you put them right okay you see he brought the message of eternal life these messenger brings the message of eternal life now remember what a messenger does what a porter does he opens the door unless he come in Paul rebuked not to church at Ephesus Paul rebuked the Pentecostals from getting away from the book of Acts now we're going to read the prophet when I'm gonna preach it to you then to see if you can believe it without the rip prophet saying it with plain common sense if you'd watch the story unfold Paul came rebuking those that was before him are dire in the church ages I mean not even in the church a the first church age is Ephesus then is that age dwindle down Iranians came at the end of the church the end of that Church of Ephesus you've got a man standing Iranians Martin Columba Luther Wesley Elijah look where Elijah if you're gonna put him you got him way down here you know how are you gonna get that messenger in the right place if he don't fall in the right place you don't have no message you'll see what I've been preaching for 40-something years this message was to to proclaim Liberty to the bride of Jesus Christ set her free that she could take a change bring her to a fifty to make a change this message the prophets message that's why the nineteen fifties in 1969 that was the first message I preached first message I preached in this message was in Athens Georgia in 1969 and it was that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man made manifest I can be gladly go with you and read them over and over showing that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the fullness of the Godhead bodily but who wants to listen talk like that because see they can't see you want to hear somebody tell about the goodness what it is this means over here and we got trunk now Trump trunk that's a life trunk for the trunk since I see Trump in his front that something Oh glory hallelujah people that shout and running all over the place because of a trunk but I ain't gonna shout about that Trump but I don't care about that trunk because they got nothing to do with me that's natural world and natural world the Bible said God said it I put in kings and I take out Kings who put Trump in the office your vote let's back up a few little bits and see who who put Kennedy in office when they prove the machines wouldn't even work incorrect you say well will them gangsters then what no gangster put him in God put Kennedy in that's what the Bible says whoever heard of Obama and Kelly come up running for president oh they got all kind of stories entailed all about it I don't care about that God put him in office that's where everybody was hollering over Clinton got to me got to be a woman got to be a woman got to be a woman I said the Bible says God puts in Kings and takes out King when God gets ready for a woman to be in office she'll be in office I don't care where anybody vote for or not do you understand what I'm saying John F Kennedy they proved he was elected by frog what did they do about it your president supposed to be borned in America they never could prove Obama was born in America horse think it's this disparate that it oh they just kind of left it silliness I'm not nothing into that I'm into what the word says about God and what me and you were doing how did the messenger come at the end of the age he always come to rebuke the previous age now I'm quoting brother on him and then he brought the age he brought the message his message was not a rebuke to the age I've tried my best to get you to see that the messenger coming to the age is a messenger eternal life I tried to get you to see that the other day about the Prophet we see a prophet is a judgment sign it's a judgment side of the world and people that don't reject it but a prophet is a message of grace to the bride glory hallelujah prophet coming to America why because there's a bride here the messenger comes the end of the age what age did Paul come at the end what age did our lenience coming to ena what age what age is brother branham is brother branham to come right here or right here which one was he well he come at the end of the age uh-huh which one was he if he come right here and brought a message of lady of SIA where's your message of eternal life who's gonna introduce the headstone come on he you said but brother day why do we need to know these time where do you need to know you need to be born again do you need to know that you need to be warned again you think the world needs to know it needs to be born again well you know that born again experiences the new birth and it's the birth of the word right within the headstone would be the birth of more than word so you're saying we don't need to headstone that's why we're dying and going by the grave that's why we're here fifty years after to go into the profit why because we're not taking what he said we're still looking for something to come instead of believing what he said is it we're looking for something to come trying to find some way to make it on some idea of our own well you don't believe in this you know I believe I've told you and I've been over and over it and I don't care what you think I said this from day one the resurrection could come there's going to be thirty forty days until the time of us to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye so we can have a glorious opportunity of brother Branham coming to preach to us I've never said nothing against it we get you making me say things that I'm not saying you're not listening to catching the word you're not putting it up on the basis of the word you realize what I'm saying if the messenger come at the end of the age and you put Paul at the end of Ephesus where are you gonna wind up of course you're gonna wind up by out of the prophets message called I'm gonna read to you alright but the thing of your thoughts of your mind is you don't know what eternal life he is you don't know what in the world we're talking about you don't know why in the world you'd have to have a Jubilee over seven years and then our Jubilee for a 50th all of those things you don't listening the word you just taking your own ideas and we went through enough to your to be able to understand what was brother branham's message okay trying to do God a service right being with not in the years of preparation but when he begins to sound works is faith Express not in the healing service the message that follows the healing service I have heard but now I see the message that follows the healing service I've read these over and over to you the rapture knowing that this message would come he knew there was a message coming he thought he'd fulfilled the most of it until he found out where it was really laying out there's a man here that can turn on the light this is introducing the headstone you remember that from Wednesday the message voice of the sign this is introducing the Messiah to the people questions and answers in 61 when he said I began to sound forth the message worded protons message begun I'm spoken word his original seed I like this one because it covers it good he said your message self for run the second coming of Christ or the full run the coming word and which Christ is the word that's why I say it like that it didn't say on the river there of Ohio River that you'll turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Father he doesn't say that but we know Malachi says it'll do that and that's what he done but yet it speaks all the way from dark lean to the end and says your message self for run the second coming well because there was more to his message than just adding the faith of the fathers that talking about long ago trying to get it it's got to go on to that part for putting 10 revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God's would be finished that's part two we just covered part 1 of turning their hearts back to the faith of the father or to is to take us to a change of the body let me just read this one I quote tried to quote it the other night I see brother branham when he brains things we look at it in a crazy way okay if you want to come up to number 11 if they can get it up on the screen number 11 which is the unveiling of God the pillar fire appearing visible among us and identifying that the message is right like he did at Mount Sinai I remember before the true message come forth Moses preached and led them out of Egypt take that to the faith of the fathers before anything could happen the place of the father's has to be returned to the church come on read it remember before the true message come forth Moses priests and led them out of Egypt but there before the real Commandments was laid down the seals was brought in ain't that something brother branham could make the Ten Commandments of seven seals but you're thinking of Ten Commandments is being a book of rules the Ten Commandments was a revelation of Jesus Christ our Paul was wrong Oh Paul said why what did Paul say that to prove that he wasn't wrong what did Paul say to prove that brother branham note what he was talking about Paul said the law was spiritual he's that scripture he said but I'm calling off Paul said the law was spiritual see the law was Jesus Christ in letter form what is the seals Jesus Christ in the letter form what had to be preached we thanked the Ten Commandments and it's a buckaroo thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill thou shalt not but see that's what we think of 10 commandments I look at it as a revelation of Jesus Christ and I look at the seals is a complete revelation of Jesus Christ what do you look at it for well I've always heard it - the law was this this condemn us all said the law was spiritual because it tried it's best to bring Jesus Christ out in the open and you know what it finally did he finally appeared on earth walked out upon those Ten Commandments but a random preached the message and he said the seals came what look before the real commandments was laid down the seals was brought in God come down before the people and prove that Moses was sent in a pillar of fire did God come down in this last days and prove this messenger was correct did he do those times yeah yeah a lot of you sitting here right now saw it then you ought to realize there was something taking place but what was taking place not in two years of preparation what was he talking about years of preparation when God was trying to get man to see signs and wonders was to catch the attention of the people right for what reason why was the signs and wonders went first to try to get the people to believe the message that was following what's so wonderful we could ever see it will run the coming word that's what your prophet said spoken word regional see the coming word which is Christ read spoken words regional seat said your message will forerun the second coming okay he priest Moses did and let him out and then God came down on the mountain now brother Branham said that Israel didn't get what they thought they got so that means we didn't get what we thought it was he said they didn't get what they thought it right he said they thought it was a book of rules he said but it's a revelation of Jesus cry now what about me and you what's the Ten Commandments to you that's got much steal thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt honor I thought in there somewhere that was wanting something about behold all Israel the Lord our God is one you see you can't get the Ten Commandments are any of you from even read that enough to know you got to put about four different things together to get to full Ten Commandments to come out correctly well no I read it so on to go read a little bit more you'll find out there's some things said in other places they wouldn't said in the original part okay see because you don't go that away well listen Paul came at the end of the age now listen is the sign of the end time sir neighs church age that is messenger he can go to 15 if you want to we know that Paul was the first messenger and when the first trumpet sounded and the first seal was tore loose and he's putting the seals and Paul was the first messenger as we found and what did he do declared war on what I asked you minute ago did Paul rebuke the church at Ephesus or did he bring a message of deliverance to Ephesus then who did he rebuked the Orthodox Church for not believing the Messiah that Jesus had produced to them are you Paul declared war and was condemning the Orthodox Church for not believing the Messiah sign that Jesus had produced to them why they should have known it they should have known him remember Paul come at the end of the age all the messengers come on the end come at the end of the age that's the end time when these things are brought forth Paul knowing the Scriptures and knowing that Jesus was Messiah and he blasted those synagogues not to church at Ephesus now from place to place with the Scriptures and was put out of every one of them till finally he shook the dust off his feet and turn to the Gentiles what was it sounding of a trumpet an angel messenger come on all came at the end of Pentecost the book of Acts is what I call penny collars the Orthodox Church the synagogue's who did Paul rebuke those people for not believing the message that had come forth by the Lord Jesus and naturally had went into the church and Peter in the book of Acts you remember what was bringing out son and heir of Winston you know Peter had a message you know whatever born-again believers got a message letter Brendan said what should we go to the school and he said tell him how the candle got lit Peter stood up on the day of Pentecost after the Holy Ghost felt and preached a sermon he had a message and condemned them people for not accepting Jesus Christ and said this is that that was spoken of by the prophets he had a message every born to bring in believers got amazing you got a message carry that message well president I don't know what my message is I should I preach all glory I think that something woman's sitting there said well should I preach now he said I had a message but I've got a message now and I believe I need to preach you need to go home and sit down and take care of you duds and forget it you know what I mean you need to get back to working at home instead of and I ain't what brother so-and-so says that a woman or two stay in the kitchen and I've nothing to do with it no I believe in the sisters having something to do with this just as well as the men but just get in your place if I was a woman and and I had been a preacher for 20 years and found out I wasn't supposed to be preaching I'd be the freest woman has ever been in the world because I know then I'd be following God's Word well I bet you can't do that code it's burning within my heart blabber okay you know but listen the truth order set us free we shouldn't have to talk about hiring clothes and dresses or whether your woman's supposed to preach or what you're supposed to do we shouldn't have to even talk about that not 50 years after listening to a prophet of course if we've been listening 50 years when I even asked you to read or listen to a tape do you go home and do it let's go ain't nobody gonna tell me what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do what I want to well bless God go on do I go to hell you're off my blood cause I've told you the truth I don't mean that sarcastically their hateful I mean the truth you're taking yourself out from under the blood when you won't do what somebody tells you ain't got time you got time for everything else right okay Paul was rebuking the Orthodox Church for getting away from the Lord Jesus in his message so he came at the end of the age where did he come right here as axe was dwindling down Paul came right here at the end of the age rebuked the age prior and brought his message as Paul days was dwindling down Iranians came on to a and to be the messenger to the Smyrna and he rebuked Paul's people for getting away from the message and brought his message therefore it comes all the way down the same way all right but here's the key you got seven men right Paul Iranians Martin Klem with the West you got seven men all right now you're hooked in time because you're still under a seven you agreed with that while ago now let's see if you agree with you kind of looked and lo que yo coach in seven seven is 49 and you had a Jubilee over seven years no just kind of going along with that let's see if you go along with it now when we let your prophet place the ages and the people and you can't argue right so what did the Prophet say now come on up number 16 brother let's read and we'll get through this and hurry come up to 16 which is the first seal you got it okay let's read and listen to what he says then along come to Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit they cabbage down on that now I've heard it even right here big man's not supposed to be appreciate stood right here I done told him he's wrong but he come here and said it he said in Pentecostals or false I declared it down there school I said Gillan told him that brother Branham said they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost exactly like it come on the death penalty you think that corrected him no but I done told him before he come here but I wouldn't a pastor so I didn't say anything else to it but you see that's where we get our ideas and we won't listen we won't even read the Prophet let's read I like little brother ones brother Maloney I like what he had to say about he called it third grade reading you know what third grade reading is third grade reading is one two three four ABCD CatDog John you know Mary going to town in other words simple reading third grade reading is simple reading right now let's do some simple reading let's see what this profit has to say about this baptism when I old ago he's sitting they can't Beach down on it and there cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the fill it out are the lady or C&H but that we found in a study of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time Paul came at the end of the age we find out that Iranians come at the end of the age Martin into the age Luther at the end of the catholic age come on and what wesley at the end of the Lutheran age where do Wesley come at the end come on did Wesley come right up here or did Wesley come right here he came at the end of Luther's age now that's what your prophet is saying so now you go on and read on through are either you're gonna say the Prophet was wrong come on look what he says and at the end of the Lutheran age the Pentecostal and watching it correctly at the end of the sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me to not to show you here we're just to receive a messenger that will take this loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the wrapping of the church now listen Luther at the end of the Catholic age and watching Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the holy ghost that wants you and at the end of the Pentecostal age though you ought to be immediately being a realizing brother branham was not the messenger to lady of seal you ought to be picking up on that by now no he's the end of the Pentecostal age he's got how the message of eternal life come on look at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the Word of God help us show you here never see you receive a messenger they take all the loose in we're at the end of the Pentecostal age one more go to the next one number 17 which is really if you got the old book his old book is 464 of the old seal book but this is questions and answers on the seals you see it's one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the Holy Spirit how many of quotes do you want that brother Brennan says the messenger is the Holy Ghost is that enough to agree with it who wasn't Luther's day the Holy Ghost who wasn't Wesley's day the Holy Ghost right listen sanctification is working holy but the baptism is the Holy Spirit now watch him that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down now you said well that's brother Brown now come on read that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the age the age of Lady you'll see of what is it because the holy ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism now you tell me I was rusev Street Holy Ghost was false and I'll tell you to eat your own words get out of the message you just disturbing the whole time look that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in its fullness of the baptism he called him a prophetic prophet but at the end of the age that it always ends upon the others we find are the messenger sent and these scruples and things that are to be placed in their place Lee like that then the rapture comes for the church so where did brother Branham come did brother Branham come here or here Elijah see they draw this according to that but Elijah comes right here Elijah comes at the end of the Pentecostal age which is the age of lady of seal but Brandon was not the messenger to lady you'll see the Holy Ghost he just said it the Holy Ghost came himself who's the manager but wait a minute you got it all messed up no ain't got it right why because you've got seven men but you've got eight manifestations of God Paul Iranian humble Martin Luther Wesley baptismal Holy Ghost and then Elijah to come they see Church do you have no hopes you don't you have no hope unless you can get rid of random to be an eighth messenger or the man to bring the message to us we're hooked in a seven hooked in time I'm reading you the message he placed the ages come on Luther come at the end of the Catholic age well let you know that that's good you read we read the next one Wesley come at the end of Luther's age and said Pentecost come at the end of Wesley's age in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Oh juice the street was just the gifts or you're blind as a dog in a blind dog in a meat house at least he can smell the Holy Ghost came himself in the gifts and you know the Holy Ghost fell in Azusa Street and Azusa Street was still Trinitarians do you know that you know the oneness doctrine had never been even caught until about nineteen eleven or twelve they were Trinitarians on the day of Pentecost Azusa Street now we're going to get into a green masterpiece if you will we run around them covered how Mary represented Pentecost when he said Marie was not the seed she was a carrier of the seed he was the seed they were not even listening the Holy Ghost came on the Zeus's tree brother Brennan said exactly like the day of Pentecost but just because so-and-so says well I don't understand that none of us understand it we can understand that but brother was all done if he might gonna understand it be brothers Owens hope I like one statement that was made years ago rudder on him said it and brother I remember a brother would because I remember this Titan brother around and said a little old woman wife's water woman you know don't even know where ABC says you can help you if she's got to hold it up if she's got to hold a ghost she can hit me but who's gonna listen to a little old wife's one you gonna get the preachers this message to listen to women oh no we're gonna put him out well it's like I said about one brother and he he said then women ought to be in the kitchen well I didn't think to ask him cuz it ain't none of my business but I want to know does his wife go out and get a natural job and work now if you're gonna put the woman in the kitchen get her out of the workplace come on no we put them in the workplace and that's men go fishing and hunting oh we got it straight the woman's in their price they're supposed to be in the kitchen well what are they doing down working at the place where the men are there with them all the time you see that's what people don't like me cuz that's just a well thing I mean if I'm gonna tell my wife she can't do you can't tell me nothing about the message cause you just a woman now you show me that in the Bible I'll show you some prophetess I'll show you some women in the Bible that was used you go ahead and do what you want to but now here I am say I do that say that would be right to put the women back in the kitchen who's gonna work and buy the groceries you sorry bunch of men ain't gonna work you got your wife out there working well my wife's got to work cold wet yeah because you got two brand-new Cadillacs that's one that don't fit in my pocket you talk to me about things talk right don't talk silly things well I think the women ought to be in the kitchen all right go get you a job what you asking just a in the kitchen well brother I'm just philippi old work well how old is she well she's working you see that's why it don't fit with me that's why I'm not popular but you see I like it that away because I can stand for the truth and I don't have to back up on anything I can read what the Prophet said when he said Paul come at the end of the age and then when he brings it down to the end and brings it to that the Holy Ghost came on the Zeus's Street in the fullness and brother Brown called it another great prophet he wouldn't come buddy self because he said dinner that into the age of messenger come now back up to the Leviticus just a second seven seven is 49 ceiling that forty ninth that messenger in the 49th was special he had the Clara the fiftieth he had to declare the fiftieth he had to speak that the fiftieth was present you couldn't go free unless you had to messenger to tell you you could go free but I want to know about 250 I want to know about the new birth that makes my soul eternal I want to know about the new birth it'll take me all the way to the change of the body I want to know about this message has within it rapture in faith and rats through and grace lays in this message the prophets message began through the opening of the seals before then he was in preparation of all the other things and when those seals broke through the Prophet the message went into eternal life right the message went into eternal life we've had an eternal life message we're not having to throw to be looking for we've got it in our possession but do we believe it was like I said now I'm gonna called brother so-and-so said this brother so-and-so said to Azusa Street was false well then you can't we read where brother Branham said that there was a great prophet came on the Zeus's tree you can't read where he says the Holy Ghost came exactly like the day of Pentecost Azusa Street so now who's lying come on musicians who's lying who's the who's got it it's vital to understand the messenger coming at the end of the age because somebody's got to stand between me and you and eternity and call for it well your prophets already done it are you better be looking for somebody else your prophet has already brought this message what are we doing well we just don't understand don't understand you know you don't want to read third grade reading said Azusa Street was the baptism of the holy ghost no messenger the prophet said to the aged mezuzahs Street started off with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and may I quote brother Branham he was required referring to them was the day of Pentecost Azusa Street and he said they were closer to the coming of the Lord than we are do you want that quote yeah I don't mind stating all these things because you see they were totally dependent upon God because they hadn't even heard the message of Malachi 4 but they depended upon God come on Lord bring us to our knees but get us out of here hit us out of here because we winding up and running out there's listen Church come on the tapes is back there from not from 2002 if you want to see if I've changed my doctrine but there's people sitting here that was here when I preached these things back in the 70s and 80s because I've always preached the messenger come at the end of the age and I've always preached it from what the prophet brought he's the one that praise placed the messengers read it he placed who come at the end of what I didn't have enough sense to do it I have done it right opposite I'd have brought Pilate to end of Ephesus how could Paul come at the end of heaven system and bring the message to Ephesus hey don't don't run with me and don't scream and holler brother Dale don't understand they were some of those men we're already dead before the age started in time don't get with me I ain't got no time to argue with you I'm just telling you I know that there were some of those men you can't lay there their message right down on a certain date so this is that or the other I know that so don't do it get out of it get down to believe in it it's either this message or we have no hopes either the Prophet brought the message or you and I are in bad shape and if he brought the message why can't we believe it what we got brother come here I'm sorry went over a few minutes that's because in biscuits there's more I - biscuits you know one of them with ham and one of them was with bacon I get the preaching too long sleep [Music] Sanga mercy and we're going anybody have any need [Music] [Applause] [Music] touch me

that floods my soul some men something happen [Music] he touch me and [Music] and your love unto us and we just commit it to you lower down may your people hear that what the prophet has said not what I said but what we've read that he said and to place everything in the order by him and to know the truth because you brought a message unto us and to know that that message has to end somewhere in the eternal life and Lord may we walk forward until that hour and walk in you in Jesus you dismissed and made [Music] I [Music]
