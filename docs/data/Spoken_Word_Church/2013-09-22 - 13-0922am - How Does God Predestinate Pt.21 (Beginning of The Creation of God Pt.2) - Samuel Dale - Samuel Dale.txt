========================================

open the eyes of my heart and how would you like to see shining in the light of your glory shining in the light of your glory amen holy holy i want to see amen and amen and amen i want to see you good to see everybody in the house so the lord if you'd like to turn back in your scriptures where we've been reading from romans 8 and then we'll go to where we read wednesday night over to revelations the third chapter we had a real good time yesterday at the fellowship meeting we wound up there was 34 of us after we got there that was a whole lot it's like somebody said one time before you know said things looked pretty bad and said brother dale shows up said brother dale showed up and the church fills up he said we had i think we had all together it was about six car loads of us all total going and all but we had a real good time in it and just appreciate the lord being with us man uh evidently and i hadn't heard this morning but she must be sick because they're not here her and richard's not here and i know richard and abby's had you know vomiting the diarrhea all week long and brother vinnie's had it and everything is just going through so just pray one for another that the lord would uh take away all of these germs and conditions and situations and all you know inner doings but amen remember the lord willing wade will be preaching this afternoon remember nanny she's still having a lot of trouble with her back inside and everything hurting her and and evidently she must be sitting up downstairs to watch uh the the services from there but just keep praying one for another i know there's a lot of sickness among us but he also said he sent his word and healed us so we believe that he is the healer right all right let's just pray then go right into our scriptures father we thank you for your loving your grace unto us we thank you for calvary thank you for all things and lord we pray that you would just help us to to understand the day and the hour that we're living and to be what you want us to be not what we want to be or desire to be but what you want us to be the lord just come among us now and bring your word unto us and then you say that you sent your word and healed us so bring forth the manifestation of healing into our bodies and thanks lord that we may be what you need to hear this world you don't have to have us but yet you chose it that way so we just thank you for doing it have your way now got each one forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you and keep us now in jesus name amen romans 8. verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god for them who are caught be called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us now remember in the the third verse let's see uh where was that called when you predestinate be conformed the image of it you might be the firstborn among many brethren many brethren all right let's go to revelations 3 14. this is a message to this age that we're living in all right amen and unto the angel of the church of the lady of siam's right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god you may be seated lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now we've been for quite a while speaking on you know how does god predestinate and we know that he predestinates by his foreknowledge foreknowledge is always first because we try to predetermine it without going by foreknowledge we make god a respect for persons and things are wrong and things uh i don't know what they've got up here that there's a cloth up here and on where it's to clean up something or somebody left it up here or what it is but we'll leave it laying there until somebody claims it you know it looks like it's it looks like it's been used some to clean up a board oh wade's got it for his chalkboard that's where it's at okay wade'd be taking the scene and he got it on chalkboard okay uh i wanted to find out about that but we've been talking about god predestinating by his foreknowledge not that he desired that certain people be saved and certain wouldn't but he knew by being infinite who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved all right now if that is anchored enough into our minds uh i'm you know i want us to think about it a little bit and uh you know we had to kind of rearrange wednesday because when we have company coming in i don't like to just run on you know i try to back up a little bit and try to help them as much as i can to to do so having company we kind of just preached a thought across of what we're talking about now this morning we're going to uh start going through some of what we said wednesday night but we're going to go through by showing the profit as he says it and doing because see uh you know i know you here understand some things but you got to remember that the service is going out that we're also responsible to try to help those that we can to where that they can not be just lost in what uh we would be saying but got to try to bring it and i found also in doing it that way that a lot of times we hear don't understand it that well so it helps to do that and it doesn't bother me for company to come in uh it really gives me a time to just kind of loosen back up a little from driving so hard because i want to help somebody else i want to be of a service to people to for them to be able to understand all right but god then would by being infinite then he would know who would be saved and who would not be saved and that way then it wouldn't be him choosing it would be us into choosing you know whether or not to accept now he has to give the infidel invitation because the bible says no man can come to god unless that he calls him all right so it's not just something you know that we're just haphazardly doing but still when he calls us we might we must make the the choice see many are called but few are chosen and why are they chosen because of the choice they make all right then we we want to keep that in our mind about foreknowledge to not just go to a foreign point or a predestinated point and try to hammer on that so much but yet to to uh get a better understanding all right then you remember what we were trying to bring out this past wednesday that when you talk about the beginning of the creation of god where we read there in in revelation we know that was the lord jesus christ and we know that the beginning of the physical body began in the wound of a virgin mary to be the beginning of the creation of god all right now because that would be a physical creation coming forth all right but yet still he's more than just to say it only applies to him coming into being in the flesh because we know that there has to be a a time that he was he was the beginning has to start and i tried to make the point there wednesday night if i could to get you to see that when we say beginning to us that means you know something getting started a starting point or we call it a creation it means a starting point to you and i but in bible terminologies it doesn't mean it that way see because john 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god well now where are you going to station that beginning as to be you know you can go back to genesis 1 but then you can go back up in to the very mind of god and and bringing it down and and see that there's many things there to be able to understand but see we that's what my point was when you get your mind into a thought a channel of what i'm talking about that you know anything that has a beginning has an ending all right so then if you read that as the way we read it of john 1 you say in the beginning was the word see you'd say well that beginning has an ending because it had a beginning you get me see that would be our human terminologies the human terminologies cannot be applied under scriptural forms and beings and and showing it right it simply means that there's a time something could not be comprehended it was there all the time then it's unveiled or whatever the word you want to use for it it begins to come down to where the human um being can comprehend so how can you comprehend an eternal god that even brother branham would use the word in the beginning before the eternal now what kind of terminologies is that before the eternal how could anything be before eternal right but to me he's emphasizing how eternal eternal is that no matter how far you go back you find god still to be there all right and that's what we want to deal with today to bring down a point to our thoughts and and we've been through this many many uh series is over the years that we've been speaking for 40 something years about these things and if we kind of make it elementary just remember that uh some people hasn't heard it but also remember something else if you count something elementary you might want to be careful it might mean you don't understand what you're talking about so the best thing to do is just sit back relax and and say well lord i've seen that before now you help others see that you know but i opened it unto me too because that's what we need to do and keeping that away all right but now do you you see what i'm talking about it doesn't matter i don't ask you to believe what i'm talking about because that would be irrelevant i ask you to listen to what is said and then ask god to speak to you about what is said and that way then you have a part to do with it all right and you can see it and i i may even totally miss it you may catch it from what i'm saying and you might receive it and i might miss it and not even have it he said can that could be done yes it can be done uh i'll give you my word for it it can be done it's like i told sister birds that time when when i preached so hard on i come from god and i go to god and on the way home that night she said brother dale i see what you're talking about i said well good you know she said he was god all the time wouldn't he i said order to let you preach well that's what i was trying to do but i couldn't get it down in that terminology you know so then don't worry about it just just relax and have a good time listening all right but remember our point a beginning doesn't mean a starting point it it means that something that was not made known but yet it was dire all the components was in the garden of the computers electronics it was all in genesis all right television the prophet would say was in genesis all right but he said it was not comprehended right see until the fire swapped 50 years ago or something maybe a little more all right so then thinking about it that way we can see that the bible says there's nothing new under the sun the things that have been are and all etc automobiles was in genesis the airplanes but it was only the component parts of those situations or whatever all right but one day it was brought out into the open and we say we created a car we can't create we just put together the parts right so do you understand my my point of wednesday night all right something that's previously is dire but then it begins to be made known or unveiled to where we can see it and see that's the way god is he was god all the time but yet he began to unveil himself coming down that you and i could comprehend him all right and to do that would require that uh you and i have the same mind you know of the author that would be doing the writing for us to understand now in that then we're just not writing a an operational book to be able to operate on a body you know you go down the doctor and say well i'll give you a book and then you can just go do it we'll just go order your book but you're not going to do no open heart operational me right yet you've got the book brother brown said i don't want any little young doctors operating i want somebody with experience all right why because the book tells you exactly what to do right that's why they say that it takes 12 years to be a a veterinarian and only takes about eight to be a medical doctor because they say well all the animals are different you know well i thought all humans are different i thought that's why they couldn't give everybody the same thing but that's just their terminology okay now get to the point then that we're looking at god unveiling himself bringing himself out into the open that he can be comprehended and then everything in the creation will reveal him if we just think about it i remember years ago i used to preach on the the creation there in genesis and taken each day you know and what was created etc etc and bringing it down and bringing it to a great comprehension you know i thought to worthy if we could see god unveiled by his own word right out of his own creation the way he made things i believe the way that man is made even in the physical we'll get more into the spiritual first but even in the physical what keeps all of them little things running in the body got a couple of nurses sitting here what makes all them things work you know can you explain it can you explain how that you can cut a place and you cut the nerves into right and you know that god has designed a way some way that that nerve ending can connect back over a period of time and the feelings will come back now what causes that oh it just happened to flip-flop around you know something else is in charge the human body was made with a an immune system that it took a lot of breaking down before it began to deteriorate a lot because it was a strong immune system and still even is you know you don't know what in the world you eat drinks you breathe you know whatever that would kill you if it wasn't for the immune system and the way it works all right we see god now is unveiling himself but he's going now what i want you to think with me we're going to go through him unveiling himself but i hope you haven't forgotten the series we've been in i hope you haven't forgotten the point of what i'm trying to bring that we believe in predestination before knowledge all right but we've been through it to go back into the back part of god's mind and we'll start out reading from christ some mystery and we went back into that mind in the understanding that you and i by the new birth are the children of god amen we are not what he created we had to be that physically and we'll get to those things but this beginning of the creation of god to this age is unveiling god that never had a beginning if you have eternal life today right the prophet says you always was eternal what the eternal life you have but there was a time you didn't have that eternal life no but brother dale i got a quote work where i was born with an eternal soul well then you you better give thought to it i've got a quote where it says for us to be baptized father son and holy ghost i got a lot of quotes where the bible speaks of a father a son and a holy ghost but yet we sat no we don't believe in a trinity well what i'm trying to get us to open our eyes to that eternal life that we have is a part of god's own life right and it never had a beginning and we'll never have an ending right that's why your prophet would come along we didn't have any problems saying you wasn't born don't know a certain day you always was eternal but then turn around and teach the whole message that you must be born again but we're taking it like acts 2 38 and matthew 28 19 you know and we're making contradictions out of things if you came with eternal life then jesus christ never had to die oh but brother dale he died to just bring me to the thought he didn't have to die to bring you to the thought all they had to do just talk to you right it'd have been just as easy to come down and just talk to nicodemus went back up to heaven and he did talk to nicodemus didn't he you know what nicodemus couldn't comprehend him you know why because he didn't have the inside teacher see i'm one that believes in a new birth amen and one that believes that you must receive eternal life to have eternal life yes but the prophet of god said well done i just got two you go back to the series and you get all of those where the prophet of god said if you have eternal life then eternal life always was eternal see we want our ideas and our thoughts to to pull to something to connect into this whole human elements and why would we want to connect to these human elements are we like who was it that was it magellan they were seeking the fountain of youth which wants to leon monster leon sailed all over the world come highway across the united states trying to find a fountain of youth is that what we're trying to find cause we gotta admit we're getting older you can comb your hair any other way you want to it's still getting gray you color it but the roots are still getting gray all right you're dying all right but we're trying to find this appeal to some way you know magic formula all right but now remember this was a point we were trying to get across god's first creation without using the creation like a beginning we're using it as the terminology of something coming forth into you know to be made known or understood so god's first creation would be his example creation you agree that's why they argued chicken or the egg forget it he didn't put eggs in the garden and let them hatch well he could have but he didn't solve all the problems he didn't talk about chickens eggs he talking about animals he made if it all been on the egg part of it then um because a lot of animals didn't come from eggs you know what i mean hatched out eggs all right i do that to just be natural because you'd be surprised how the carnality of man's mind will sit and turn off everything you say it's because there's some silly stupid idea that they've conceived in their mind right well you was wrong well like i said the other day if you can tell me i'm wrong you've got to know what's right come on you can tell me i'm wrong to be able to tell me i'm wrong you've got to be able to tell what's right right if i told you my big toe was god well i don't agree with that well now you tell me what's right i guess your big toe but listen church god's plan of redemption i thought that's what we were studying i thought we believed in redemption i thought we believed that redeem goes back to where you come from well then the eternal life that we now have within us by the new birth puts our soul back to where it was in the beginning well you agree with that if you don't come show me something else i'd like to know but think about it now god's first creation would be his example that everything from then on would have to line up to that example and he can't tell you one way to start and then change on the way right so the way he does it first he's got to keep on doing it or else he's changing his mind he's deciding he was wrong somewhere and picking up a better idea well i don't believe in that kind of a god i believe in a god that his first creation would be what he wanted now i say it again first creation doesn't mean a beginning the word beginning doesn't mean a beginning point like we talk about it i've tried to prove that the automobile was here it's in the dirt we put it together the prophet said that the first time he said television was in genesis i thought man you mean adam and eve was turning channels you remember when we used to have two and 11 and then they wound up with four you remember when you started with them you know you remember the antenna you had to go outside and turn it to get two and if you wanted to go to live and you had to go turn the antenna kind of oh but we got it but that was here in genesis right see what he's dealing with his abilities when jesus turned around and said television to no man that what television i've heard preachers you know i heard the first television now the first one was in genesis but a vision is a form of a a tv is a form of a vision all right get off that but get to the point now so his first way of doing any things would have to always be the right way of doing it and the way he would come into understanding you know unveiling himself to you and i would be the way that he would unveil you and i don't know what you think on that because you see i i believe in eternal life i've preached about 20 something sermons now on for knowledge to predestination going back into the mind of god and being part of the mind of god that does the thinking amen you see if he had a if he knew that if he remembered last sunday if he made us he knew he was going to fall well now it wasn't eternal life that he was talking about are you with me it wasn't eternal life he was talking about it was you and i as people did he knew it we he made us we'd fall because we're going to get down probably won't this evening but i mean today we'll get to it wednesday or whenever adam and eve had eternal life that's what your prophet said blasphemous names go read it all right then his way of bringing it would have to be line up perfectly how did he come into being well what do you mean he always was okay how did he come into our understanding or come into the ability for you and i to comprehend we could not comprehend him you got to admit it's hard to even comprehend him after all of what he's done for us after all he's done all these years and give us eternal life it's still hard to comprehend an eternal god and that's what people keep asking me questions about it and i know it's questionable i have them too was god real before the world you know what kind of body did he have where did he live you know was it some world or something you see church we go haywire crazy trying to figure it out he said was god real if he wasn't real where did we come from something brought us you want to talk about us being real but you see he never had a beginning like humanity has a beginning that's right to redeem means to go back where you come from so then if we believe we always was eternal then how can you be redeemed what are you going to redeem eternity with but you know you can go back to eternal life if you believe it correctly if you receive it by the new birth all right so when he was saying that he knew if he created us we'd fall he was not talking about eternal life he was talking about us as peoples and remember the first two that did fall they had eternal life well how did they fall with eternal life how can you do wrong because that body and spirit is not born again amen well brother dale i don't do no wrong what's in you cannot sin but the bible speaks plainly that we're nothing but sinners sins the scripture calls it christians the prophet said have sins well now brother there what that means is that that means just a plain old nominal christian all right you're the one dividing it not me you're talking about adam and eve but think about it now in god's mind as we covered the morning stars were singing and the sons of god were shouting for joy when the sons of god saw the plan of redemption come into view that's what your prophet said remember and i know there's a quote in the seal book that's what i was just dealing with my brother and said they fell from eternal life now how can you fall from eternal life there's another one of them matthew 28 19 you know acts 2 38 deals how can you fall from eternal life adam and eve fell from living eternally in flesh because they never had achieved that ability all right now any other explanation outside of that what are you going to do with it all right thank god for some simple explanation sometimes it helps us to understand adam and eve never died and went to hell the prophet said they had a redeemer so they fell from ability to come to eternal life in flesh because they had eternal life in their soul but what about the plan of redemption now i tried to explain it to you the other day we wasn't sitting there and eternal life looking down and say yep we're going to go down we're going to be lost that's mormon that's a mormon doctrine that was all up in heaven and decided to come to earth to be lost a word that we could glorify our father but you see we we just take our human terminologies and so well it's got to be this because of that i remember brother hampton's had a point already get tickled at him he said a equals b then there's one thing for sure b's got to be the same thing as a you think about that is true but when you try to apply that to if it says this we've got to go that way well the prophet said it and i believe it yeah i got a quote and i just read it this morning were you talking about the trinity you ever heard him say let's stand and address the third person of the trinity see there he taught one god for all him years but really he was tremendous that one's what i'm gonna hold on to because he's a trinitarian you know why because you're one and that's what you want you want him to be what you are quit trying to get the message to change to fit your life change our lives to fit the message can we be what he is what he's talking about all right but you see the key to understanding the bible is we'll get to is to see how that god made man why because the bible says let us make man in our own image now look at that right the bible says let us that's two i found one one day when the prophet was talking about and i thought well that'd be something to try to get a trinitarian look at he said he was talking to the animals when he said let us remember he already made the animals before he made the human right the human body was made on the sixth day right because there wasn't no creation on the seventh he rested but see then that's where you can't get that together it's why it's confusing because chapter one deals with the sixth day but chapter two of genesis deals with physical creation but you know when that physical creation took place it took place in chapter one under the sixth day i'm not talking about the spiritual creation wade's going to get on that this afternoon i told him i'd hold back as much as i could but i just want you to think the key then to understand man is to see that how god could come and be unveiled you know and reveal himself all right then the key to understand god is to see how he made the man because he made us in his image all right see that's the key to understand is to see how he was made and you better hold on to this now you better hold on tight because his being made had no beginning right okay if i'm wrong i want you to show me so if the man is made in the image of god he had no beginning okay so what i said sometimes it's not good to think i know all about it so we should get onto something else and sometimes the little catch phrases will hang on to us and we begin to see hey wait a minute i don't exactly understand then you'll see that i wasn't playing around wednesday night i just turned my ways of saying it don't ever think then i'm not trying to bring out something when i drop back it gives me an opportunity to simplify things as to help you and i don't understand if i was you i'd go back and listen to wednesday night services i'm just saying that of course i know 90 of you ain't going to do it but at least 10 will so that's the only good ones the other 90 you just paying the taxes around here it will not be that way brother to hell well if you went to school and the teacher assigns you a subject you're supposed to go home now as smart as sister ruth is she still had to turn in her homework they just didn't look at her and say you're smart we're gonna make you a nerd we know your dad is smart your mama's smart your brother's a doctor you know that's not exactly the way it goes is it that's not exactly the way it is with god if you're going to believe me as your pastor and i'll give you an assignment go back and do the assignment i ain't got time okay forget it then you fit into the category as i said you're making yourself the 90s it's not me i'm not throwing off on nobody you tell me to listen to something you better believe i'll go listen to it well because you told me i need to listen to it so you need to go back and listen to wednesday night and just watch the tone in the way i just preached across the whole scale of something for us to look at because church i haven't forgotten at least i haven't forgotten when we're talking about foreknowledge and predestination the foreknowledge and predestination is dealing with earthly child travel journey life the morning stars sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy if they were the sons and daughters of god that was eternal life that's why i kept emphasizing it hey down here is where we're shouting that's what i said over the fellowship meeting yesterday and he said a word and i said wish i could sing shouting on the hills off globe read why because i'm shouting now about what i see i'm rejoicing over the word that i see about you but get this in your mind then write it down when we talked about going upward and going in and coming into the mind of god i haven't left that yet just because we started a condescending toward earthly forms doesn't mean that i've stopped anything see i do believe i believe the eternal life you have by the new birth that you must receive when you got here and jesus christ had to die to release it but i believe once you receive that eternal life that eternal life is the life of god and that's not another god that's god in another form that's his offspring his children that's who we are but but brother dale i know it i understand it's hard to comprehend that god would condescend down to mankind and take that mankind and make him a part of the god that created him that's hard for us to even sensibly think about he said well brother dale you're making yourself god i'm not making myself god if i'm a child of god what am i god made manifest in another form called a son i'm not a son of a son that's why i believe the way he condescends is to make himself known to you and i and then when he creates the man he's trying to get the man to see who the man really is and what he has made us i just don't forget that he made us i just don't forget that we were lost body spirit and sold and doomed and on the way to hell and jesus christ came down and paid the price he went to hell for me he sent his soul back on the day of pentecost the prophet said in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost he said and as it's until down through the ages and coming out to where we are and once it's given out i believe in eternal life i believe the eternal life you have is the life of almighty god we're not a second person because he wasn't the second person yes but that's what i don't know see we're second person but he's the first person no he ain't the first person he is the person and then that don't make us the first person not the second or the third that means god now is invade unveiling himself in human flesh amen in you you see why has i fought so hard all these people in their doctrines i'm not against anybody i love everybody i don't i don't have anything against somebody that don't believe the way i believe you know why because it was time i didn't believe the way i believe and i never have believed i was the only one on the beach i fought you that thought i was a prophet and things told you to the pulpit you're you're wrong i'm just a child of god i'm just a minister of the gospel i have no ministry of relating to a prophet well the word the word's supposed to come to you too according to my bible and my prophet the word comes to the spirit field we're all prophets in the bible terminology and even put your sisters in there because we're the ones that the word has come to but listen church the key to understand is to see how god is made made what are you saying how god unveiled how he come into a situation or existence of where we can comprehend him and then by doing that then we can look back at the man he created and see the man he created shows exactly the same way he came that's why we're not trinitarians see we're not oneness well he sure doesn't sound like well no no no because see we're we believe in god unveiling himself god changing his form but it's the same god well that's oneness ain't it no because he would never will lose those attributes even though they are finished and we get into eternity we will still remember him as our savior as our healer as our father as our advocate we will always remember that he never loses an attribute he just makes it into being the word it will come forth even the bible says today will come to sonship paraphrasing the scripture will terminate it doesn't mean terminate like going away with it doesn't mean that it means that it's not existence in the basis of calvary but yet you're still looking at him with a nail prints in his hands what about looking at an eternal god with nail prints in his hands you can't you can't comprehend that it's just it's uncomprehendable you know for our human terminologies oh all right but see if you read genesis just in the creation of the days and what was made etcetera and etc you'll see the plan of redemption coming into view because now like i said when you get into chapter verse when you get into the sixth day you'll find man created right when you start over on the the chapter 2 that doesn't mean you've passed this the rest in the 90s god worked six days and rested he's been resting ever since he had to come to earth and do all he done but mankind was created in genesis 2 in a physical form that's over after he created in genesis 1 26 and 27 in a spiritual form if we can find out about that man we could see where we're at and to find out about that man we got to find out what it would mean to say that we are created in his image we got to see what image he's got amen right then we can follow it okay let me read just a little bit let's get started let's go to chrysler mr god reveal and i know we've been over this and over this but i hope you don't have problems with reading what he said christ the mystery god revealed this is paragraph 102 through 104. now god's great secret mystery he had before the world began now god back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve he had a motive in doing it what was his motive in order to let himself be expressed now let's don't get up there too far because see that's where we would go too far on the terminology of thinking we're god this is himself being expressed it's not me and you being expressed you've got to let him be expressed first amen my brother told me one time he said brother dale i see it he said i see us coming into view it's wonderful but i said if he don't come into view first then you're messed up it's not him coming not us coming into you first he's got to come into view first because if you try to come into view first and you are into satan's part of saying i am god remember the devil said that's what he wanted to be right i will ascend to the most high i will be like god then he gets over in writing finally i will be gone aren't you careful that you might fall into that no you know why because i've already seen the plan the plan is him coming first that's right it's not you're not coming first we are part of the plan but it's his plan all right he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star i had a molecule or anything he was god but he actually wasn't god at that time because god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him all right now as i said back to the thought a moment ago do you think what do you think about god well a god is just a spirit he has no form he just floats around he's just you know he didn't need a world to exist in because he just floated around i wish brother branham had explained a few things you know paul went to the third heaven and brother brown said it he thought he went to the first right now if you want to get technical he said he went to the first heaven you won't get technical with what he's saying the first heaven is the millennium i'm quoting him whether you like it or not but what i'd like for him to explain one time he said there was a seventh heaven not lord we can only think about one or two and this man talking about the seventh heaven see we think that that heaven is not real and we're going to read wednesday night we're going to read where the prophet says what did he make this world out of he said i don't know because it wasn't nothing there to make it out of it right but it came from somewhere what if we one of these days come to find out that this world here is just a camping ground for us that we're able to enter into other dimensions right when in another dimension television is passing right through us right now you gonna prove it set one up here and turn it on does all them people run through them little wires they small people ain't he that's how dumb we are and you mean today that i can pick up my telephone and i can dial into you and instantly somebody will answer the phone right now you explain that no our mind is still in the cable that run across the ocean you know and they finally got connected and they said hello london how you and we realized when that happened back there that we said london you know what i mean so much time lapse was into the wordings and things you explained to me how all this works and we'll begin to understand what heaven's about i believe heaven where god would i believe there's a heaven where he lived i believe he was there and he was real was he a man the bible says he was the prophet said he's a being he is not like the wind blowing here in yonder he says he had the headquarters you know we might get away from one of these days and our dumbness and think about we talk about you know we've preached for 2000 years about streets of gold what's any problem with streets of gold well it could be some streets right why can't it be gold do you understand what i'm getting at something real i'm talking about a real god what kind of a world did he have my lord what are we even thinking about some kind of a world that a god would be living in when he's god and i'll just ask you a simple question where did this earth come from he said well it was created where was it created from well he took molecule he took this and he put potassium where'd he get the potash come on i know i've been on that for so many years till i go crazy about it and i go crazy about thinking about an eternal real god too i don't think about just some imaginary spirit floating around brother branham wasn't tearing up the scriptures when he was telling you god is not a not like a wind he's a being he's a person he knew john 1 5 24 well god is a spirit you think he was trying to destroy that scripture i know it gets on me and i'm sorry but what gets on to me is not you people i'm telling brother ray about it this morning what gets on to me is the preachers in this message i'm sorry they've got the gall to stand in your face and say i don't agree with you you say well show me well i i don't know what it is but i don't agree with you shut up that ain't even common sense that's right in school they taught us one plus one equals two and we were smart enough to come up with two plus two is four but you know one plus one is really 11. oh you're just being silly that's what i'm trying to show up our silliness that's right if i tell brother collins to brother calling i don't agree with you i'm supposed to tell him why i don't agree with him amen or else shut my mouth because i can't show him he's wrong i just don't agree with him you know what i'm saying i don't like your looks you hurt you know you know something when brother colley come in one day he's been hanging around those swat folks he'll start laughing because he knows it he came in one day and he walked in the office where i sit i looked at him i said let it grow out that's the first word to say you know what because he shaved off his every which he called at you much thai asia i never didn't know the difference in bearded mustache he shaved it off he didn't look like brother collie i said let it that's the first word i said i said let it grow out don't try to be like us if you want to look like us that's fine you don't look like us forget it look what you're supposed to be black man without a beer or mustache you know what you're calling he's funny look at feller right my brother daughter he's like our granny because that's common all right just be what you are let's be christians yes but god is a being amen he's not he's a person everyone said he's the person of eternal life yes but we just can't comprehend that well that don't mean we can't talk about it that's right how many of you to eat lunch well do you know how that that works you know do you know how it works and all that food gets in there and goes to this and goes to that and for some way it stops in certain places and it goes through the walls of the intestines and etc out into the body to make blood cells and can you explain that no but you ain't gonna quit eating and you ain't gonna quit talking about it well i ain't gonna quit talking about god but i believe he's real because he brought he created me i believe i'm real don't you believe you're right but look what he says now i want to get this thought and then we'll i'll just quit on this right here brothers love these because they don't have to rewrite new notes in the office they just pull them up again and just keep pulling them up but look what he says he was not the father we know that not god excuse me not god because god is an object to worship well there's nothing to worship him now he created angels we read and they worshipped him now angels are not people they're ministering spirits but yet they have a form they are people and i mean look like they can have a body in a form of what we call it but they're not body spirit and soul as human beings right because when he first created them they could only worship him but when they failed it didn't make him a father i mean a healer or a savior it was not their fault brought out his attributes were you listening well so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed what's his attributes father son holy ghost healer savior redeemer et cetera all right and in him was love and him it was to be father and him was to be son and him was to be a savior and him was to be a healer this is before anything was ever created already there and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god so my opinion the first thing that he made was angels all right and they worship him and that made him god and he started from there okay as in previous message he tried to explain to bring that angels began to worship him that was before there was even a molecule in the earth there was nothing it was all darkness there wasn't no sun no moon no no moon there's no stars no nothing then he was god and as he asked job where were you when i laid the foundation of the world see when the morning stars sang together the sons of god shouted for joy now where were you see that was way back before the earth so now i'm going to say something so listen carefully your morning stars i was brought it up to a place that's what i try to do i get up what i think we can understand i have to back off and wait a little bit the sermon on to come back up again when we were talking about the morning stars singing together the sons of god shouted for joy the sons of god were before the angels were created i just dropped the bombshell the first thing he created was angels people are not things so it's not a creation like we call it a creation the sons and daughters of god we're part of god amen the sons and daughters of god have returned to life i haven't lost that yet they are eternal so he created the angels as his first things that he created but his sons and daughters never had a beginning if they did were you going to put it in eternal that's right all these doctrines is running around we always was eternal why don't you get back into talking like dad about something i believe eternal life never had a beginning but i believe in god that we wasn't little people running up and down in his body you know scattered all around all of us doings you profits when he put that in the scr in the quotes i didn't talk about the sons and daughters of god but look now god had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what i want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever begun when he existed alone that's not up here that's me and now this unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you'll understand clearly then you see i believe on what is being done now i'm going to ask brother anderson if he can do something for me can you pull up paragraph 106 while i'm talking i deliberately left it out but i want you to see what he's talking about a great mystery that god had in his mind before the world it's a secret to express himself so then he knew he was going to bring into being a group of people that would be his offspring but he knew if he put us in human flesh with the free moral agents he attacked upon it that we would fall but he knew that within sight of him could not fall what was this great mystery that he had then you'll understand clearly then you see on i believe what is being done i'll run this up run on up a little bit higher brother before we god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence there's a reason it's psalmist nobody didn't know anything about it this great sister mystery secret that we're talking about is just what he said it was the seventh seal the thing that everybody says can't be understood it can't be understood by the world i agree but the bride of jesus christ can see it amen amen why because god used the prophet to tell us to unfold it to unveil it to speak of what mankind would not darson to even try to speak of what god had in his mind to reveal the plan of redemption the plan of redemption wasn't completely unfolded or made known even in the great apostles and even on the day of pentecost it was not made known until this end time when the prophet came to reveal the secrets remember he has no certain mystery remember that he used to take all of the loose ends and time together but he's to reveal those seven thunders which are the revelations contained in the seventh seal and it'll be these divinely reveal mystery truths that literally turn us back so i'll say this for wade's benefit this afternoon so if we can see how that man in genesis 1 26 come into being we can see how god can come into being we can see how god come into being we see how that man comes you mean god can use two people to speak on one thought yeah no problem if the same two people have the holy spirit there's no problem anyway come on musicians and see if i was you i would go back and listen to wednesday night because you seen it wednesday night my point was one time get away from creation get away from beginning get away from thinking of your terminologies and get down to where that when god has something over here veiled and then all at once he opens that veil what was there was there all the time brother brown said god never sent a son to die he came himself that's why i asked that time i said when did son of god appear and everybody was saying 2 000 years ago i said the son of god was in the beginning before the eternal and yet you call him a son because remember nebuchadnezzar saw something and if he saw it he knew it was god because he's taking care of the mother three and if he could see it he couldn't call it nothing else but a son another form you see i believe in god unveiling himself that's why i'm not a oneness because one is stopped as jesus the lies form of god i don't believe that i believe the bride of jesus christ is the last form of god to the gentile dispensation so we're not oneness neither are we trinity let's stand together what we got 668 inspirable 668 anybody have a need what a wonderful change in my life has been wrong since jesus came into my heart i have a light in do i like some people experience things i've heard some of you talk about being in the presence of god and knowing how real he is see maybe everybody doesn't come to that point but if you'll just think about the new bird you just think about the new birth of god living in you eternal life living in you it just makes you like somebody said i don't remember where brother branham but said you just think about him he said he's so real to you until you wish you could just reach in there and get him and bring him out and just hug him and hold him salvation is not a conversion of thought well i was going this way and i turned around what made you turn around alcoholics anonymous will turn you around but they can't bring christ into your heart they can't bring that person that i'm talking about get into you till you know it's real one day somebody is going to believe it and we're going to walk off this earth because they're going to see how real he is since jesus came into it was all kind of life and last night at the fellowship meeting because i was trying to lead that song and brother richard got up behind the scene he said you heard that thing so many different ways you know something like that because everybody's got their own words you know to go to anything but it's what you're thinking about it's what you're thinking about if we were back there shouting before the world begun you say well that was just god's mind all right you say well that was when okay i'm glad you thought of that away because that's when we're out here today right we're right here today shouting about the salvation that's been revealed so as we're dismissing let's sing that to one another okay if we don't get it the same way that it's supposed to be we'll sing it the way we want to sing it nobody has to worry about it right shouting on the hills of glory shouting on your dismiss shouting on the hilltop shouting on just keep singing that way over and over we're shouting on the hip dog father just be with everybody and we just miss this afternoon oh
