or 3:00 o'clock somewhere around there for the youth like I said we've already got questions already banked up and ready to talk about so for all of you that have the young adults had real good participation last time and we're looking forward to having a good participation this time so Lord bless you let's go into the service now the six fold purpose this will be part three let's go ahead and do this if you'll turn to the turn to the scripture we're going to I kind of I told you I'd give you the the paper but I forgot that the ones on the internet can't see that paper so we're going to kind of fix this that for the ones on on the internet so they can see also Lord bless you hope you enjoyed it it's um it's something that I really enjoy I enjoy talking about the Lord I enjoy talking about what what God's done for us and what he's still gonna do for us and is gonna do for him after we leave so let's get into this and we will we will we got the organ there now so we're gonna have to make them no one not nothing Sarah's off over here get all over me just say that out loud yes this way okay all right turn it this way just a little bit how about that that better well Sarah sorry Oh how's that okay I know you're gonna have a little glare on it but we working on that Daniel 9 verse 21 let's go to the Lord in prayer know we all have again unspoken requests on our heart we always have something on our heart that we that we carry with us so just keep those prayers in front of the Lord the Heavenly Father would thank you today for an opportunity that we can stand before the purchase of your blood you went to Calvary for one purpose and that was to get a bride that we see now in the end time and also Lord you you're gonna get that huh little Benjamin group that 144,000 is gonna come out of there and be filled with the Holy Ghost but Lord has got to be that we get out of here we can't do it alone we have to have the Word of God we have to have a fivefold ministry that's solid that will give us the word Lord and it'll teach us Lord you said you'd send the Holy Ghost and it would teach us and lead us and guide us into all truth so we pray Lord that truth will be spoken today and that you'll be the one that does the speaking father you'll be the one that does the revealing because we can't do that on our own father we pray that you'd just be with the ones here Lord bless them in body if they're not born again father we pray that you would just as we always think of the ones Lord that some come in and say I couldn't go to sleep or or I was so burdened with lord I that burden on my heart for several people that I could that I named him in my head all the time Lord and I know there's one sitting here Lord that has children husbands wives different things or two out in the world not serving you Father will we pray Lord that they'll come under conviction father and that you'll go to them and you will stir their water Lord so much to where they want to know more about you father and we here today want to know more about you though we may some have been walked many many many many years in this Christian way but there's Lord there's more of you to be had so there's more of you to be given probably give us this day our daily bread bless us take care of brother Dale and the family down there is their doing the funeral at the moment Father we pray that you just be with them touch each one father bless us take care of us in Jesus name Amen Daniel 9 21 yay while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I'd seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talk with me and said old Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of my supplication the commandment came forth and I in come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved thank God for that he's talking to you today thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to do six things we talked about three this morning we're going to get to rest this afternoon to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem unto Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times and after threescore in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself he was called for me and you and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city which was Titus in the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation deceased and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reason of the work and to all right so we we already know that do I have to keep telling you over and over one week equals seven years you should know that it's in the BIOS in your Bible business if you don't know it read it it's in the book of Genesis a man thing your Bibles been in your Bible the whole time man been there the whole time so I'm just gonna kind of do it like that Chloe what are you doing back there that's got to be her that's all right it's okay she's saying praise the Lord y'all just didn't hear all right so what we're talking about now is this last week or last seven years yeah I was thinking I thought well we'll just do it on a chart Thomas Thomas is back there in the back I want y'all to know he has rope he has took notes and wrote the whole thing full you can't hardly see him when I wrote he wrote notes let me see some of y'all's or some of y'all that don't even have them you got to study really you do I mean if you're not you gonna be confused alright so this is the six fold purpose this is Daniel 9:24 to me this explains everything in a nutshell we got to go through dates and times and we know what's going on we know this was the church ages this will be the Gentile rapture because as soon as we go up he comes right down through two witnesses and starts the 1260 days according to revelations 11 the 1260 days of preaching to the Jews is that right say ma'am all right through through what to prophets do to two prophets 1260 days I'm just gonna write Armageddon right there because in the midst of the week according to the scripture what happens the man of sin breaks his covenant he's gonna make a covenant with many for one week all right now remembered that he is the Antichrist we're not here when that signed we'll get into that later on you will not if you see that treaty sign you missed the rapture okay so that happens right here then right so he shall make a covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week what's in the middle of seven three and a half or 1260 days so you got 1260 and 1260 got it so now but what's going to happen is is in this time this period Israel is going to be redeemed and so is the land or the city because remember what have I been telling you it's to the Jews and to the land or Jerusalem or our building of the walls or building of the temple and all that we'll get in just a little while that okay okay so there's three things got to be done one and I'm going to just put finish because you can read it number two make an end of sin finish the transgression make an end of sin we're talking about we're going to go through in just a minute and three we're going to reconcile all right so we're going to finish the transgression make an innocent reconciliation for iniquity now what does that do that that takes the 144,000 and redeems them that all rights amen their redemption comes right here about what about the land what about the other three it takes 6 this is a 6 fold purpose not a 3 fold purpose it's a 6 fold purpose so you gotta have three more which will be number four we're gonna talk about in a few minutes okay we're gonna bring in everlasting righteousness if you'll get this I'm just gonna paraphrase here and you may not be and see it from the back but they can zoom in it on the camera and let the people steal it see it on the internet so we're gonna bring in we're gonna talk about bringing the never license rice in this silt division property and a Northland most holy because if you anoint the most holy here's the key if you anoint the most holy brother Brown tells you I'm gonna read you what he said that is us coming back into the Millennial temple anointing the temple well now if you've only like most people in the message this is what they see this is what they make it out to be that there's only 1260 days left after the rapture to finish Daniel 70 weeks that's not true according to the Bible so who we're going to believe the Bible because how you going to bring in everlasting rice and there's gonna be a battle right here I'm gonna read it in the Bible there's a Battle of Armageddon that destroys everything right here how you gonna bring in everlasting righteousness and how you gonna put all six of them over here how you gonna nort the most holy in us going into the Millennial temple that's being built by the Jews in that length of time can't happen ain't gonna happen you got to have time for bringing in everlasting rice and cell division and property in North North the most holy here's what the problem people think that we're saying they're saying that we're preaching that there's seven years tribulation I never said that the Bible never said that the Bible says he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week I'm just reading you what the Bible says and in the midst of the week he's gonna cut off after that 1260 days he's the Antichrist is going to come in going to break his covenant and say hey stop it I am your God that you're looking for and then what's going to happen is the Jews are gonna get really mad and they're gonna get mad at these two prophets than 144,000 gotta put them in there cuz they're gonna be saved all they need is these three three completes the birth justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost completes the birth but you've got to you've got to bring the land then you've got to bring the buildings in cuz it's to Daniel people Daniels people and the city how you gonna build a Millennial temple anointed let's come back in Revelation 19 I'll read it to you how you gonna do that and then have a battle of Armageddon where everything is destroyed again you'd have to rebuild the temple you'd have to do all these again but why not be careful with what you're talking about see what the Bible says see what the prophet of God says that there is one week left after the rapture now there's only 1206 days of preaching laughs there's only 1260 days of what they call Jacob trouble are the Tribulation Period because what remember the Gentiles are going to be hunted like dogs the foolish virgin and all the ones that a couple water in my name and even these 144,000 but they're gonna die and then they got to come back 144,000 of the Jews they got to come back somewhere and Bill they listen there's got to be a temple built between right here and somewhere right here according the Bible you can't build it right here and then destroy it so what I'm telling you the Bible is that you go back to the Bible so you say well I got this quote well it better match the Bible and we know it will because I'm gonna tell you one more time whatever you think I'm saying the prophet of God was right now didn't Jesus tell us one time he kind of looked at his disciples and he said these things were here to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent Jesus said some really hard things to drive a bunch of people away eat my flesh drink my blood and all those different things he was pretty adamant about it and then there was a lot of people left so you know what that's the way it is in the message have you not heard several years ago when they all started leaving the message Geoff Jenkins and all them and I'll name the name cuz I really don't care that's the first thing they said was his brother branham was so wrong in Daniel seventy weeks that he was so confused at how could he be a prophet didn't he the ones of you that heard it the all those other ones very same thing they said no Daniel seven weeks and the clouds the days they just did not have the Holy Ghost cuz well that without the Holy Ghost you will leave this message if you got the baptism I Holy Ghost right now today you cannot leave this message well the brown said to the evidences that you receive the word for the hour that you're living in and I'm gonna I'm going to interpolate I'm going to interpolate and I say that you can't turn any of it down and have the Holyoke you turn any part of the word down you're a word rejecter amen and brother brown it was real clear about where word rejecters wind Amen now to say you don't understand it that's a big difference and say that don't mean that Amen alright so here we are set up and then we'll start reading her quote one week equals seven years the Bible says in Daniel 9:24 that there would be a six fold purpose this six fold would have to come to pass to get them into their millennial reign now I want you to understand something remember there's lap overs I've always said the Battle of Armageddon is not a one day battle it will not be a one day battle because it is a battle of man it is a battle of a comic mashing buttons there's gonna be atomic explosion all over the world see there thank God we're not gonna be here and it's gonna take a while it may take two or three years for everybody to die cuz it's not gonna kill everybody one time but as all that's happening we're safe somewhere the 144,000 safe somewhere but somewhere they got to come back and build that Millennial temple to spark I'll read it to you to start this millennial reign it may come back in here a little bit this way but what I'm saying is the Bible tells us there's one week left after that man right here makes that covenant there's one week left to finish the 490 years of Redemption bringing Israel back would you believe that or not it's the truth all right so we've already had 483 years of it 69 weeks so there's one week left to make the seven four years to finish and put them because it says here since here it shall make it desolate even until the consummation of brother Graham said the consummation is it's when the Jews go into the Millennium come see that's for them this is their time here this is their time it took away jacob's trouble this took away all these things it took away end of sin reconciliation for iniquity bringing in everlasting righteousness Philip division and anoint the most holy that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon but this is to the Jews and it will be literally a thousand years time continues on unto the white throne judgment because remember it's still the old seventh-day brother Brahim explains that read your future home and the different ones you see that is still the old seventh day it's going to be 1,000 years but they could be lap overs either way I'm not gonna be concerned with it but I'm telling you one thing's for sure when this is over with the Millennium has begun it has begun it has begun when set dang that's the whole purpose that's the whole purpose for the six fold purpose is to get them in the Millennium look we don't need a millennium the bride that we're not even promised the Millennium we're we're eternal right here we're eternal we don't have time times in the dividing of times we have time is no longer when you get born again time is no longer time - this doesn't mean anything to you but it does to the Jews and it's the exact there's exactly 1260 days now what's gonna happen you say well at the twelve hundred and sixtieth day if they all get saved are they gonna go in the rapture they could be days months in between all that he just said in the midst of the week the Antichrist is going to come in and say I'm your God well it may take him a month or two to get really mad already take it may take them a month or two to kill all the 144,000 but to fulfill the scripture they all have to be killed somewhere to that okay done all right and everybody got their chart this one everybody got that I want you to hang on to it because look this chart right here is official according to George Smith this is what Rebecca drew on the wall at the tabernacle cuz I read it I was listening to it the other day he said Becky that looks like a girl well that look down there that listen he's got a little dress on but it's that kingdom of gold and all that you know the statue standing up but this is official now look you see the top set the type is probably be back in the 60s cuz it one of them old typewriters it click click click and the little kids are going what is that go look it up go back about 40 years and you'll see that kind of typewriter so so this is exactly what was written on the blackboard at the tabernacle when brother Branham preached Daniel 70 weeks so I've set and watched him draw all kind of charge I think I'll just take the one the Prophet drew to me that's official and you know what it's according to the Bible all right according the Bible I don't see why people it's why brother Dale said it's really hard to preach the truth it is it's hard to preach the truth it's not hard to preach area you can just draw whatever you want to it make it all fit the way you want it to fit and now but this to me is this this settles everything to me is the sixth full purpose when I read it I'm like man there's got to be one week left after the rapture to make all this come to pass there's got to be seven years left to bring all this to pass because you can't put this over here and finish it like everybody says but all they want to be you know they want to be the first one they want to be the they wanted to be the Bishop of the message or something whatever they want to be and that's fine with me I don't care all right so let's go to 2nd chronicles and let's do a little background here just like what we're talking about this morning in second chronicles let's just go through this real fast talk about 2nd chronicles and all the vessels of the house of God great and small the treasures of the house of the Lord the treasures of the King and ever fences and all that he brought into babbling and they burnt the house of God and break down the wall of Jerusalem and burn all the palaces and destroyed all the goodly vessels in other words that was a fulfillment of the prophecy of Jeremiah that they would be in captivity for 70 years and that the temple and all the things around Jerusalem would be totally desolate there would be nothing there because when they get the Attic to rebuild they got to rebuild the temple and the walls in Jerusalem's everybody got that okay all right so now let's go to number one seventy weeks are determined for what purpose whose people was it determined to pum Daniel's people go to number one well yeah let's read the city full purpose seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do those six things now let's go to number one kind of fly through this because I believe this morning we took our time and you I believe you got it better then you've had before seventy weeks are determined upon thy people for what purpose for what whose people was it determined upon Daniel's people the Jews and what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but Daniels holy city so to fulfill all the 6-volt purpose you got to bring a city in there somewhere you got to bring a temple in there somewhere a ma'am how you gonna do it over here you're gonna destroy it again it's the Battle of Armageddon that's not gonna happen the destructions got to come and then you bring in this this and this oh my gosh that's a ma'am well well I just read it on the board whether you believe it or not that's your business all right six vote purpose we'll go to number two and the seventy of weeks covers from the going off of the church until the coming back of the church that space is what he covers now what's he talking about because in Revelations for one we go into rapture we are not saying until when revelations 1921 will read it tonight where we ride back into the Millennium so the gent this is really this isn't to the Gentiles but it is part of the scripture and brother Bram did spend three sermons on it so it must be aborted get it right number one to get that you and I have to do the same thing they have to come under the same Redemption you and I did go through justification go through sanctification in the baptism of Holy Ghost through two prophets coming and talking to them but to us it's what the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost talking to us through a fivefold ministry puts us right here and then we're not heard of again or we don't even come back to revelations 1921 and we come back in the millennium not our time but to the Jews that's their thousand years that's their Golden's you believe that they never celebrate it they okay all right that space is what it covers now not all of them in two weeks of Daniel part of it so what he's saying is we got to get the dates and the times over here don't you got your gap right here this is when we were grafted in with the olive tree we were grafted in right in here they were taken out now they're gonna be grafted back in right here 144,000 they're going to be grafted back in the olive tree that never died we were living in listen we live off the life of the Old Testament we live off the life of the Jews and Israel and what they do and and you know we don't have to worry about the pots and the pans and they're doing the sacrifices but it's for example there's what they told us in the Bible that's for our example to them the ends of the world come upon man's probed at it for 2,000 years but listen we have the perfect interpretation by divine vindication the prophets said amen so we have the perfect interpretation what are we doing with it what are we doing with it making it everything else but the divine interpretation but there is a truth amen seventy weeks are determined just keep on going let's go on down look to the next paragraph and seventy weeks are determined upon thy people now remember that's all the journey of Israelites have on this earth that right there it just culminates in this one week all right all that other is information and how big they're they're determined seventy weeks she's just determined that's all lauded to the Jews upon thy people and upon thy holy city see he never takes the city out so you have to bring the city in you've got to bring the walls in you gotta bring the the temple in because that's important to the Jews okay therefore these seventy of weeks now don't miss it it were a reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem because remember Battle of Armageddon is going to be all destroyed everything is okay until there'll be a new city built somewhere in here it can't be built over here it's got to be built somewhere over here because if you build it here man's just gonna kill destroy it here amen all right once you look at it with some good revelation and we've had some good teaching here and like I said brother Dale's been preaching this since 1974 so so it's it's I hope it doesn't become common to us I don't want this this message should never be coming we should always like see when I was when I was going through this and I read that scripture where they said let his blood be on us and our children I always thought man how shameful that's exactly what they were having they had to say they had to say let his blood be on us that's what kept them covered that's what covers me and you Lord I plead the what I plead the blood I never seen it like that before and I'd appreciate it so many times you never see it when you said let his blood be on us and our children they were saying it as a prophecy we know it's a prophecy of rejection but it was a prophecy of salvation that protected them until they except right here until they accept the blood see they don't now because they didn't think cry they just thought they hung a guy I mean they put him on a cross he was just a common thief may have been a good man may have been a prophet don't know but when they realized that was God Almighty and human flesh that was there side that was their Jehovah that was who they had been looking for all those years are you talking about just like well like I said the women are gonna separate from the men they're gonna wail and moan for days when they find out this is good that they had killed the Messiah revelations 11:1 and there was given me a reed like into a rod and the angel stood said rise measured the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and threescore days that's 1260 days clothed in sackcloth and then we talked about this morning here's what we got - this morning - with justification sanctification in the baptism the Holy Ghost they have got to go through that to redeem the Daniels people not the city not the city yet not to land yet but you got to get look it's just like you and I Adam fell and then all of the world fell everything fell underneath Adam so now when the second Adam come he redeemed everything back to where Adam was and then brings a bride and then until we come to a body change and we're a over able to overcome this fall the fall when we're able to overcome the fall then here comes the earth back up again here comes everything then the 144,000 they can come up when they come in then what's going to happen there's going to be a natural battle but that's not going to end it it's going to be within the earth brings forth again the desert will blossom like a rose in this time of the thousand years of millennium now we're not even talking about the future home it's way over here it's a thousand years it's off the chart but that's our home that's what we're looking for that's the city that we're looking for all this right here is to the Jew but we got to go because we're on a honeymoon for a thousand years with Christ while his rote ruling and reigning the 12 tribes of Israel sitting on the throne walk you know what he's only not only one on from these guys clean there with her with him and she will never leave his side ever again she'll always be there with him and then what's going to happen after this thousand years is there's gonna be a white throne judgment then there's gonna be a battle that it's not man's about all this God's battle because remember Satan still alive Satan is still alive and he's gonna be bound up right in here we're gonna read it in just a minute he's gonna be bound up for a thousand years and all his demons that didn't kill him it's just gonna make sure they don't have anything to do but right here at the very end they're gonna pop back up and God's gonna have some holy fire for Battle of Gog and Magog is going to be a holy fire it's not gonna be man's fire because in that battle God is gonna physically kill those demons nothing will be left except the people that were given eternal life to the fifth seal Jew the cup of water of my name the foolish virgin all that and then we enter into the future home which is way down the road over here so you think well we're coming to the end now we're coming to the beginning we're coming as your as a Chris as a non-christian you are coming to an end but as a Christian you're just look we take a rapture in the body change we got a thousand and seven years at least we gotta wait till we get into our new city but you know what it'll be like Rachel and Jacob remember he he fulfilled her week he worked seven years to get a wife and he said it was but just a moment because of his love for Rachel you know what God's been waiting over two thousand years plus seven years to get us to this place to where we can what be husband and wife sitting right side by side amen all right let's let's go number one finish the transgression I'm gonna background just a little bit and then we'll get into them good to the subject finish the transgression what is the transgression is a rebellion it's to recognize its as recognized by Center and sinners and as God forgives so that's what a transgression is the transgression is you do something to get somebody so they did something against God they rebelled right there's his rebellion they rebelled against God but God said I'm gonna finish that transgression finish the transgression so it's going to be done away with now look let's read number at the quote number three now we go back into Daniel we'll find out that in Daniel we'll find out here the 24th verse to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression what is they transgress it is to go against something because remember they were against God all the way I mean all the way from when Mo's well actually when they told Moses to go up on the mountain and get what God said and bring it to them don't let God speak to us Moses you go up there and get what God said bring it to us and we'll do the Bible says we'll do everything you say they lied they lied from that point forward they made Liars they've not done what God said that's why God had to put him away he tried to keep him to be married to him but she just kept going out playing the we read that back in the history and he had finally just I'm done with you I'm gonna divorce you of course he couldn't be married to them in us at the same time okay I can't have to leave my wife it's going against something a transgress against me it's to do a wrong to me transgressed against you is doing wrong to you so Israel did it wrong to God and in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgression we'll be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the Holy Ghost so now let's finish the transgression that's number one all right so then we talked about in Romans 11 if you we don't I didn't bring it up but remember the engrafting everybody understand that when we say in grafting you and I or grafted mmm there was an olive tree when I just said that he had to divorce him or put her away he cut down some of the branches and he grafted in the Gentiles the wild olive off of another tree over here grafted into this tree and then we grew for 2,000 years well now remember I read you in the Bible he couldn't do away with this tree because it still has life he still but he said what is now the mystery is is that God can graft back in the same limb that he cut off two thousand years ago he can graft it back in because right here is doing grafting he grasped him right back into the tree because these people are Jews there's not a Gentile in this bunch they're all Jews even the two prophets are Jews so there we were looking this morning how that justification finished the transgression he justified that group of people and put them on a journey with those two prophets of 1260 days all right number two make an end of sins number two make an end of sins now let's read Daniel to finish transgression make an end of sins that's his second person of purpose of coming first is to finish Israel's transgression and to make an end of sin where did Israel sin where did they do their vital sin where did they separate themselves from God now we read it this morning Matthew 27 go to Matthew 27 verse 20 through 25 let's read verse 24 when Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude he just didn't know he couldn't wash that blood off his hands and they couldn't either saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person see to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and our children and as I said before that's the best thing they could have said because they were going to they were gone any way that we're gonna crucify him so let that Holy Blood stand because remember the blood speaks but remember that it was nothing chemistry of the blood it's the life that was in the blood all right all right so now in Sakurai thirteen verse one in that day that should be a fountain open to the house of David to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and uncleanness he's beginning to clean up Israel's sin he's finishing the transgression making an end of sins listen that's what he's doing for you or not when we come to a body change we have had an end of sin we have no more sin when we come to a body change even our brain is going to be changed we're not gonna be thinking like what we used to think the former things are passed away behold all things have become new amen you're not gonna have a dirty thought in the body in a change body that's your problem now you're having a minute I won't say dirty thoughts in a dirty body which I mean we're not you understand what I mean you can't help the thoughts come in but boy when we come to that place you say it can't happen well you know what may not to you but it's gonna happen to somebody somebody's gonna come to a place to wear this thing we've got to deny our natural birth we've got to lean so hard on our spiritual birth until that will take over and change our body because remember body change is not coming from stuff out here it's not body change is not coming from Israel getting back in her homeland they've been back there for a long time it's gonna come from what you got inside of you it's gonna come from the word that you hear that comes from here to here Zechariah 13 sixth is that one shall say unto Him where are these wounds in the hand then he shall answer those which I want what a gracious God those which I was wounded in the house of my friends not my enemies my friends awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow and saith the Lord of Hosts smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and that's what happened when they smote the Shepherd they put him on Calvary we read the quote this morning the sheep was scattered what Israel was scattered dispersed they were told in the Bible that if you don't do what God said I'm gonna send you into every nation and you're gonna suffer your heart think about six and a half million you know the population of Georgia is only like 12 million so half of this whole state of Georgia six-and-a-half million people children mothers fathers old people didn't matter they put them in a gas chamber just because they were Jews just because they were do nothing else they had not sinned against nobody as far as natural but they sinned against God a long time ago and they're paying for their sin just like you and I would do the same thing number five there be so ashamed of their self when they stand there and see that very one that they crucified in the night standing there our precious own Joseph there'll be such morning they'll say where did you get those scars he's sitting in the house of my friends see what I mean to make an end of sin of unbelief that was that's what he's coming for and I said before if you can't remember in your journey where you come to justification where you realize you were wrong you had transgressed against God and you were like way out there somewhere well when he extended your arm you took it well he finished your transgression if he still remembers what you did in your past you're not saved but if you're saved thank God because he had to what he had to finish their sin pre-poo prophets he had to preach to justify them now we're looking at sanctification where they come to a place to where their eyes come open so much to us amen I'm the one who put him on that cross that was the mossad that was the one we were looking for and I did it no no no your your your you know your ancestors to town no their 144,000 they're gonna get a updated revelation I'm the one that put him on a cross because you and I can say the same thing I put him on that cross cuz he died for me and then you died for you so you keep on going a little bit further coming to make an ender stand put it away what's the first to finish the transgression then make an end of sin then we're talking about number three to make reconciliation for iniquity okay let's go to the next part but we're talking about sanctification red blood red horse rider we can put all these I can put all these six fold purpose in the six seals there's your white horse red horse black horse because the black horse is what the new birth you die they're gonna have to die to be reconciled because you know what they can't be made to - you can't be mad at the devil married to God - that old party who's got to be dead da-ad Black dead I'm talking about that as dead as dead is not if you're not dead then you're still alive it's to you Paul said it's not all that liveth but it's Christ that liveth in me amen twice what they're gonna say they're gonna realize Christ died for them that he has caused it listen you got to have a revelation that God took your sins away because you still remember him Satan still remembers them his little imps and his little demons still reminds you every day but you got to come to a revelation that he has finished your transgression he's made an end of your sin that's a revelation that just like standing up saying I'm saying while I'm justifying the real me didn't do it I'm gonna go from smoking pot and drink a beer because the real me didn't do it no you're lost you need saved let's go back to justification because the old use not dead yet but if you'll do it right if you'll do it right look at the woman at the well she was a at five six six six husbands got cleaned her up so he can clean you in a minute listen there's no difference in the prostitute a murderer and whoremonger it's all sin you disbelieve the Word of God is just as bad as that because you know what you're doing if you still if you're still alive and Christ is not alive in your life that's what you're doing you're prostituting yourself out to the devil that's why we're all under that part we all prostituted ourselves out to the devil amen that's pretty hard but it's the truth all right number three is to make reconciliation for iniquity to cover to purge we brought in and make an atonement on that day of atonement we're reading maybe we read it now no maybe we read a little bit later but when you come to that day of atonement it was a morning for the killed what they're gonna do they're not gonna mourn that Christ died here no you read where it says where did you get those scars in the house of my friends they'll realize 2,000 years ago they put him on the cross you got to realize 2,000 years ago that he made an atonement once for you and when you accept that atonement it's just like what just like a pardon a pardon is not a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon the pardon is there I wish we'd realize these things that yeah I was thinking the other day you know we somebody was yakking about you know the people that if you like blow point one eight you're drunk now they're gonna change it down to 0.08 and all everybody's in an uproar you know why it didn't bother me one bit that you don't need to you did you chime in and and tell the people are boy the government's just you know why that law has no effect on me they could go to point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero that's right be but see it you understand what I'm saying so there's laws we got laws all these different things but if you're not put under that law if you don't drink and drive it doesn't matter they go to having one in your car doesn't matter the man you know what that didn't scare me a bit shouldn't scare you either we get scared all these laws and stuff didn't reef don't remember we all were under the law until Christ came to what make reconciliation so to make reconciliation for their iniquity he's going to in this 1260 days he's going to reconcile and I read it before in Corinthians about reconciliation let's skip to that because it's okay iniquity is doing wrong as they did at the cross he made reconciliation but it will not be applied to them it wasn't applied back here on the day of Pentecost it got applied 120 in the upper room they applied that atonement they believed that Christ died for them and got filled with the Holy Ghost acts 2:38 but it but now remember he don't have to get back on the cross over here to redeem Israel he did it back here it was a pardon but it wasn't accepted as a pardon until right here they're going to what open the eyes of the 144,000 to realize that they've already been you and I gotta realize that Christ don't have to get back on the cross you hadn't got to go do 25 Hail Marys and go see the priest it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see it let's skip on down let's read second Corinthians go out like that therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature and that's what's gonna happen to learn in 44,000 listen they're gonna be right here right before the the body change in the rapture they're gonna be you're not going to be able to tell them from the other Orthodox Jews they don't believe Christ like no there's nobody in Jews and jewelry now that believes that Christ died for the sins if not they'd be a Christian big difference so what's going to happen is right here God's gonna literally lift his hand by these two prophets just like he did you through a preacher through somebody telling you about God's Word it's not that he had to write something new well now Louise says Lisa's coming to the Lord I need to write about revelations 24 because he's coming in now that was already there revelations 22 revelations 20 everything was already there what happened to you God just lifted his hand away and that's the same thing he did with these two prophets for these hundred 44,000 he'll have to write a new Bible he don't have to write a new anything he just takes our blinders off so that we can see who see Christ not see them two witnesses they'll see Christ that's what we want to see now we want to see Christ in this ministry therefore if any man be in Christ is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and that's given us the Ministry of reconciliation so got to come through a ministry to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation so we have today the word of reconciliation and then now we look to keep go to the next one says that's the atonement so you got look right here you got justification and sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost that reconciles you back to Christ clothes reconcile means to take apart he made an atonement so that you what-what happened in the Garden of Eden there was a separation God couldn't talk day-to-day without him like he used to while there was sin in the picture but it's got to come back where God came down in human flesh in the second Adam and took that away already you just gotta get the blinders off your eyes to see what he's already done and he's wrecking he's give us a word and a Ministry of reconciliation that you're listening to now everybody okay say Amen revelations 11 well let's go to oh wait it's a Quran I don't get too far ahead and she'll come to pass in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplication now remember that's going to begin here and go through all this 1260 days because God's getting ready to take 144,000 out and that he's going to protect that city listen he's still protecting it now this world would love to see Jerusalem flattened most people in this world would love to see Jerusalem completely destroyed well God's got his hand on them because that's his city and that's his people and then that's why that's why the folks the judgment will not strike this world until we're out of here this little pre stuff we're getting now ain't nothing to be compared to when we get out of here the wrath of God is going to be poured out on this nation and just pray to God that you got the new birth and you won't be here and I will pour upon the house of David upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is bitterness for the firstborn in that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of had a remand in the valley of megiddo battle of armageddon is going to be in that very battle be in that very valley of megiddo about that and the land shall mourn every family apart we read that this morning so let's go to the next comment I got here for three processes brother instead completes the birth let's go to the very next where it says three processes right there three processes completes the birth so we come right here to this part of the twelve hundred and sixty days because when you reconcile listen when you when you in Christ or reconcile you're going through a daily journey but you've got a statue of a perfect man they're not promised in you that they're promised to get the Holy Ghost and then they're gonna take a rapture well they're gonna be killed and then they're gonna take a rapture alright that's their promise that's I promise cuz I sent a New Testament they don't believe in you they ain't got time they only got three and a half years to get it all to just get born again but that's all God wanted of them that's all God wants for them that's all he requires of them is to get more and again and go to justification sanctification and to reconcile where he can now talk to that 144,000 just like you talks to me and you know no no this bride we know that no this bride no no this bride but he still he can't kill that tree that's his tree the olive tree is his tree he can't cut it down that's the Jews so I we referred to through the chart but look I like these three words finish I'm glad God finished my transgression I'm glad you made an end of my sin and reconcile me back to Christ that's exactly what we go through is exactly what they got to go through it everybody got that alright so now let's go to revelations 11 if we don't get done I'll finish next Sunday I'd like to get finished today though but that's okay now we going back to the revelations 11 this is the promise of these two witnesses but watch what they're going to do everybody okay watch what they're going to do cuz I left this off for the first piece that when we read revelations 11 now we're gonna read 1 through 13 and there was given me a reed like a rod and the angel stood saying rise measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentile and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months all right forty-two months this is the position I'm reading to you right now 42 months nobody got that all right now we'll give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy 1260 days thirty times two clothed in sackcloth so that's that's the time that they're going to have to preach to the Jews according to the Bible to bring out 144,000 now these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth so we know there's two of them and if any man shall hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth now they're not gonna have a flame thrower going out of our mouth that's a type it's the word it's the sword it's the it's the fire proceeding out of their mouth saying no you're not going to touch boom you're out of here you know or whatever you know is there they're just gonna be able to control nature because the sixth seal opens are during this time not even been talking about that maybe we're later if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devours their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must be in this manner be killed if somebody throws a rock at them they like to throw rocks over there their stone throwers alright Levi's tows a rock get them to witnesses and hurts them Bible says they die so they're pretty - very serious guys you know why they've only got a certain length of time stay alive and I'm sure they know that when that revelation comes to them two prophets they're gonna look in Revelations 11 and say all right that's us well we got 1260 days let's get started alright they have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy which same with Elijah and have power over waters to turn them to blood which was Moses and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony look right here look at me when they have finished their testimony they've got to preach 1260 days but when they finish their testimony the Beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them if I got that say men and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where our Lord was crucified think about seeing in all the cable news all the TVs all the man the coach the media is gonna be there anyway the one of these two guys that can if they want it to snow ten feet deep all they do is say snow or somebody tries to bother him they say dead while you know that all the media outlets cuz that's what it says watch and of the people in kindred and tongue and nation shall see see to television they will see you through television they'll see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in the grave why they want to humiliate them they finally killed him and who killed him that great who's that guy right there that descended out of the bottomless pit that's Satan through the Pope when he comes in and breaks that covenant God said okay we're finished now do with them once you wish and they that dwell on the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry the whole earth they listen they're not going just torment Israel they're going torn because remember like I said the CIA all these different don't you think they're all gonna try to kill them way over here but they got 1260 days they cannot be touched and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth not just Jerusalem on the earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood up now what about that three days in Jerusalem in that hot Sun ain't gonna be pretty but all of a sudden the cameras are going to be turned on them and here they go and stand right up and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither so somewhere in that time the 144,000 were killed - because it looks like they all gonna come up in a resurrection alright and they heard a great voice from heaven saying come up hither see we already heard that voice we heard that voice in Revelations for when we went to resurrection we heard that same voice right there that was the voice of the resurrection this is the voice of the resurrection and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld then what a wonderment I can see the television cameras going or just be looking at them and they just disappear in the same hour there was a great earthquake what's beginning to start listen when they go up in a rapture folks there is ZERO Holy Ghost on this earth there's not a person in this world of seven probably billion people at that time we'll have the baptism of Holy Ghost so there's no holding back this is the total wrath of God being poured out on the world in the same hour where there was a great earthquake and a tenth part of the city fell and then the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the God of heaven so right here is your battle of Armageddon in the midst of the week when he terminates that contract with them in the middle of the week comes the Battle of Armageddon so let's go to Daniel 12 verse 1 and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation now keep in mind we still got three folds to finish we still got three folds to finish you can't finish them over here there's got to be this going on and then this happens we'll read that in just a second and many of them that slept over I'm sorry such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people now who is thy people Daniel and thy people you and I are already gone the church is coming the brides already he's not drawn by the bride he's talking about Israel the 144,000 at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book you notice it didn't say in the Lamb's Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life is the bride only eternal section the Lamb's Book of Life is a bride only it's not 244,000 all right but he said it was written in the book see why if we read the Bible we get it right you read the Bible you get it right all right and many of them now watch this is gonna of what's gonna happen is and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life something to shame now what happened is that's not gonna happen right here God's just telling us what's going to happen so there's no resurrection right here now there's no Bible for that brother Branham even tells us in the rapture how many different resurrections they are or how many raptures it's not a rapture to Balam Armageddon except that witnesses they're already gone they're gone we've already they're already left they've left them they've left the earth so there's not another rep there's not anybody gonna be resurrected in here that didn't watch look it says and many of them that slept in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt he's talking about over here it's the white throne judgment and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased then I Daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the one on the other side of the bank rivers kind of strangest to two witnesses okay got it at once said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river what is waters people how long shall it be to the end of these wonders and I heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the water of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth now this is revelations 10 happening in the Book of Daniel but remember in Revelations 10 he puts one for the land one for don't see water lifts his hand and said time shall be no longer that's you and I that's for the Gentiles that we don't have a time we don't have a date we don't have a time but they do they have exactly what it's saying right here swear by him that liveth forever it shall be for a time times and a dividing of times 1260 days or three and a half years right and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished and I heard but I understood not they said I O Lord what shall be the end of these things he said go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end you and I are fulfilling that Scripture right there you and I are living in that Scripture this day this scripture is being fulfilled in front of your eyes many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand what a promise alright let's start with number four I'm not gonna keep it too long list we have to just do but I want to do number four at least to get you going onto the other side of this 1260 days everybody okay amen number four to bring in everlasting righteousness now watch that's the fourth thing that he came for the fourth what did he come to do to bring in everlasting righteousness make an end ascend reconciliation and to bring in everlasting righteousness when Israel's transgression had come to an end now when does their transgression come to an end here here they're going in rapture alright when is this transgression had come to an end when Israel's transgression now we're going to I want you to catch this because when we bring that woman and the Dragon cast out you're going to come right back to this scripture again be sure to put it down when Israel's transgression has come to an end Satan who is their accuser and our accuser Satan will be sealed up in the bottomless pit when what when bringing in everlasting righteousness something that come on in so so so it's gonna happen over here Satan is going to be sealed up for here he gonna be sealing up over here somewhere like I said it's an overlap he's gonna be sick because you can't bring in everlasting righteousness while Satan's running all over the world right think sensible Satan is going to be bound because look like I said before this battle of Armageddon nobody but sinners left demons devil there's no Christian people left but to bring in everlasting righteousness is when they put him in the bottomless pit because we're going to somewhere in here that 144,000 has got to come back I don't have scripture for it well I do but I don't have a quote for it but I do that they gotta come back and build a temple you can't bring in everlasting righteousness in this time period right here cuz how you gonna bring in everlasting righteousness one more time and then have a battle of Armageddon okay so it's got to happen after the Battle of Armageddon when everything's dead everything's gone Satan has become powerless because what he's putting that bottomless pit cuz now everything it walks that earth this hunt all amen this 144,000 I just saw that there's hundred forty-four thousand and the bride are gonna be walking on this earth and Satan's gonna have to be down here because he's got nothing to work in up here he's got a lot to work in up here oh they gonna kill him too prophets I just read it but when that Battle of Armageddon comes something's going to happen kill everybody that's the center and then everlasting righteousness 144,000 and whoever we got they're coming in they gonna come back to earth then they're gonna build something for us to come back everlasting righteousness watch this number four be sure to put it down when Israel's transgression has come to an end Satan who is their accuser and our accuser Satan will be sealed up in the bottomless pit when what when bringing in every in righteousness something that cannot end all because unrighteousness will be done away with how're you gonna do that right here if there's only three and a half years left after the rapture as most people ninety-nine percent of the people the best is preached I said 99 I mean it no other ministers know I'm telling the truth but how can that happen according to the Bible because my final resting place is this Bible that puts it together for me okay cuz quotes will kill you you know what killed Jesus you know what killed Jesus Moses is quote Moses that they had Moses quote book and that's what killed Jesus huh a sinner didn't kill Jesus well technically he did but the center of my sin killed him but who actually was the one that was against him the priests the people that read Moses quote book we have Abraham as our Father Jesus said you don't have the same daddy I do if you don't know Abraham you know me what he was telling them is your quotes are killing you I tell you that's what's killing people now the quotes that we that I save and contend that you think are different and wrong and I don't if you can bring a major doctrine and not have to throw quotes out if you can take every close take everybody every Bible every just while I'm bringing you we're walking right through this last week by the Bible and the prophets message then I have no problem I I got plenty to stand on because I'm going to stand on the Word of God and then hmm and righteousness will be done away with let's read revelations 20 listen can we go about 15 more minutes revelations 20 verse 1 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him up thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and put a sail on him that he should deceive the nation's No More till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season let's read Ibaka to brother Brown reads this talking about bringing in everlasting righteousness watch woe to him that buildeth the town Habakkuk 2 verse 2 12 14 woe to him that buildeth the town with blood and stablished a city by iniquity behold it is not of the Lord of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire and the people shall weary themselves for very Manatee but the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea how in the world is that gonna happen right here no it's gonna happen right here all right number eight oh my he says in other words when the enemy has been put away the end of sin has come the bringing in of everlasting righteousness that come now how is that gonna happen right here one more time look over this way how's that gonna happen right here okay happen according to the Bible can't happen God happened over here so it's got to be time left all right that's what I mean that 6-volt purpose we'll just explain everything if you'll just let it and you'll quit running quotes through your brain that's our problem quotes will kill you the bringing of everlasting righteousness has come Satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit this is the six fold purpose and the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea amen glory to god it's coming brother it's coming women will be ladies and men will be gentlemen amen then he starts singing the song when the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the earth to see in the sky oh my heart is groaning crying for that day of sweet release when our Jesus shall come back to earth again look all right now the Millennium then is on you see that so it's gonna happen right here cain't gotta happen over here what I'm telling you we just face final resting places in the Bible now the millenniums in his own that's when the millennia when the city is to be built so are we gonna build a city here are they gonna build a city here they gotta build a city here the city's got to be rebuilt over here it can't be rebuilt here and then the Battle of Armageddon tear it down because remember the abomination that maketh desolate which is that mosque of Omar they're sitting over there on the Dome of the rock remember the prophet of God said they're gonna drop a bomb right down through the middle of it with less in the middle of Jerusalem like I said this morning it's going to destroy that whole city in an instant an atomic bomb they're not gonna drop a firecracker down the hole no it's gonna be a bomb an atomic bomb but thank God will not be around to see it all right now the Millennium is on that's when the Millennium when the city is to be built forth I had about six more scriptures but worry I will too let's go to number five seal up the vision and prophecy now this one you might think this one is a little bit out of place but it's right where it's supposed to be because brother Adam refers that the vision and all was sealed up until the time of the end but let me let me get something to you a little fault that I had here mm-hmm well we have still up the vision and prophecy number nine what is it oh hallelujah do you see it class this revelation of Jesus Christ and of his power of his coming at the end time was sealed up until now that's what he comes to do is hit from the scholars no one do they want to apply sealing it up back yonder to those prophets and everything way back it won't hold water but the vision this vision has been sealed until right now that's where I placed my faith that God will reveal them seventy weeks Amen seal it up till the end time close up the words and seal the book until the end time what did he do to seal up the vision and prophecy Daniel had prophesized these things they've all been unsealed but when you come right back here it seals it up in a group of people you're sealed here they're sealed here but it seals up the vision the whole part of this is being played out and to seal it up wrote a little note here they know where they stand at that moment so you know where you stand when God reveals the word to you because you're gonna steal that vision and prophecy and you know why he's gonna do that because you're a bit you're gonna be a mystery people don't go understand you they don't understand us now they think we're crazy but that isn't it sealed up inside of us well it was still depend 144,000 now they've come back to seal up the vision and prophecy inside their self but they're getting ready to release it because they're gonna have to when you come to the number six watch so that's the real short one brother branham does not spend much time on that one at all so let's go to number six to a north the most holy we get to this one then we're good now all right got about 10 minutes before clock you should be okay y'all stand outside for two hours and talk after it's over with some anoint the most holy number six so we've come through the first tree to reconcile the the people now we've got to reconcile the temple and the building and the earth because that's what happens here bringing everlasting rocks and bringing we're bringing where on the earth we're coming back to this earth God's gonna watch our let man wipe it off then we're going to come back to it bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy in those people cuz listen they gotta have a vision and prophecy to build that temple because you got to go back to Ezekiel 40 like what we're gonna read right here hang on number 10 now to anoint the most holy now folks this took a prophet to tell us this because the million years idea mine and your idea would be to anoint the most holy we would think that it would be go way back to the temple and all these other things that's know what it is he said it says to anoint the most holy and the most holy is not a building the most holy now I'll let him explain it now to anoint the most holy now this may be a little bit strange for just a minute to many of you teachers but just hold it for a minute let's see how it come this is the anointing not of a man Jesus is already anointed is that right the book of Acts said that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and went around doing good healing the stick and so forth Jesus is already he is Messiah Messiah means The Anointed One is that right but here at the end of time he's going north the most holy hmm oh are you gonna do it over here Kate gotta be over here whatever you think it's got to be over here it's got to be time well and I'll prove to you that there's time left anyway maybe next sending em cuz there's a hole if people don't even read Daniel 10 over in Daniel 10 and-and-and 11 I think it is hang on just a second I had it marked and I took it out this morning but I feel I need to read it that okay I'm gonna give you a bucket full right here it's not on here just hold what you got I'm gonna read it and I'll read it next Sunday we'll give you something to chew on cuz it's the continuation of Daniel 12 that we read a few minutes ago twelve nine says go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end many shall be purified white tribe but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand verse 11 and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away that right there hmm at the time of the day that sacrifice will be taken away watch this this is Bible and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be 1290 days now that's there's 1260 that's 30 more days that's lapping you over into the Millennium oh that's not all blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the 1,335 days put you way over into the Millennium huh how about that anyway let the Bible let's let the Bible do it for you amen so they see that she's got time right there read Daniel 12 if you want to but it puts you way past the 1260 days that all right what is the most holy to my way of seeing it okay pull it back up which I believe I can prove it by the scripture is to anoint the most holy which will be the tabernacle that will be used during the Millennium now is that here how you gonna build the tabernacle and then destroy it it's got to be over here Joyce at the last part of that last week everybody got it right then everybody believed what bro Graham said I do now listen and see why I get it described in Ezekiel the fourth chapter he didn't mean that he meant at the 43rd chapter the first was watch we're gonna read that let's go back to his ego and find out how he pictures it in the Millennium how they will anoint the Ezekiel 43 let's read it a little bit find out so let's go where it says afterwards paragraph 119 go you gotta go back to paragraph 119 there you go now this is the continual continuation of the quote from brother Branham now watch discrim description of the temple that is to be built in the Millennium now anyone any reader that knows from Ezekiel the fortieth chapter until the 44th chapters nothing in the world but the Lynn Millennial temple being erected on earth when the glory of the Lord fills it and so forth like that now we're gonna just describe the temple in the 43rd verse first 43rd chapter first to sixth verse listen now let's read Ezekiel 43 1 through 5 afterwards he brought me to the gate even to the gate that looketh toward the east winds Christ coming from the east and behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like the noise of many waters in the earth shined with his glory and it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw even according to vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city and the visions were like the visions I saw by the river Chebar and I fell upon my face and the glory of the Lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house that's in Ezekiel that all rights they men know and then now look at Chronicles second chronicles 5 this is when Solomon brings the temple up and chronicles came to pass that the trumpet ears and singers words one to make one sound to be heard and praise and thanking the Lord when they lifted their voice with the trumpet and cymbals and instruments and music praising the Lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to Minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house what brother bruh I'm saying is God's not gonna fill that house back again like that he's not gonna come in in the cloud he's coming in in flesh he's coming in flash thereby okay with that number eleven is six full purpose God came into the sanctuary that was to be anointed and was given over to him for the people to come to worship so to anoint not thy holy place but to anoint the most holy place and we notice that New Jerusalem is the most holy place and the anointing will be upon the New Jerusalem that descends from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband the anointing will be on them them that one zarubin will dedicate his temple after it was rebuilt it was not anointed again because it was already been anointed been tore down or just instructed again he meant it was destructed and they put it back together the destruction had come to it it had been instructed again and put up so there was no anointing of it anymore when it was one time anointed that carried on through and it goes on to this very time but when God sets up the Millennial tabernacle he will anoint the most holy not thy holy but the most holy but when the King takes his throne for 1,000 years glory she's over now the anointing of the most holy will be the last thing take place when the tabernacle is erected the resurrection that's come now remember that's gonna happen inside Daniels 70 weeks because it's the six fold purpose this is where we're at right here all these six have got to happen inside of that last week when the tabernacle is erected the resurrection has come and we know that he's given a what a timeline the resurrection has come look look watch me the resurrection has come the Jews has returned Christ and his bride has come and the Jews and 144,000 are sealed the Millennium has taken place there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be anointed the holy holiest of Holies and the most holy the most holy place is a sanctuary where God lived between the cherubs and at this time Christ will sit in the most holy place with the anointing upon him and they'll need no Sun for the lamb in the midst of the city shall be the light the Sun will never go down in that city is old Uncle Jim used to say and it never will because Christ will be the light the Anointed One and the King will come and take his throne for 1,000 years let's continue reading now after this the pride appears look after the 70 weeks the bride appears after the 70 weeks the bride appears in revelations 19 if I got that same am the 1st 16th first year Rives with her bridegroom the mighty king oh I don't know whether we're going to get it or not let's just read part of this here's the book here's where the bride will come after this see after the Millennium set up then Christ comes back with the bride what and we're the into the temple now listen let's read it and then we'll be done and after these things after this tribulation after the woes after the seals after the plagues watch after the casting out of Satan after the setting up of the Millennium I'm reading your Bible after these things I heard a voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor' power until the Lord our God for true and righteous are thy judgments for he had judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication has avenged the blood of his servants at her hands and again he they and again they said Alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and ever that's the old prostitute church her smoke rose up and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down to worship God they said upon the throne saying amen hallelujah and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our God praise our God all you his Saints and you either fear Him both small and great and I heard it was the voice of a great multitude brother Brahm says listen here you are Church after she went up in the third chapter here she comes see and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many waters and the voice of a mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth hallelujah watch the marriage of the lamb has come now here she comes let's be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife not bride his wife had made herself ready here she comes both bride and bridegroom and to her was granted that she should have right be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called in to the wedding supper of the Lamb and he said unto me these are true state the true sayings of God I fell down his feet to worshiping and said see that I do it not I am of thy fellow-servant thy brethren and have thy brother and have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Christ of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy and I saw heaven open and a white horse oh my he that sat there almost called faithful and true and righteous and this does he judge and make war and his eyes worst lanes of fires ahead within many crowns he was crowned white king of kings and he had written not had her name that no-one knowed but himself and he was clothed with white best your dipped in blood and his name was called the Word of God brother Branham says in the beginning was word words we got into Word was made flesh and dwelt among us who is it Jesus and his name is called the Word of God and the armies which we're in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean glory here he comes and out of his mouth will go a sharp sword that that it should smite the nation's shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God he had on his vest earnest I name written king of kings and Lord of lords what is it here's the culmination right here his people had just crowned him king of kings and Lord of lords coming back to his holy temple anointed with the presence of God to live and reign through the millennium with his church amen the appearing with the mighty King to take her place at his side the new royal anointed temple now the six full purpose of revelation 6:1 - revelations 19 21 is fulfilled that's your Bible so according to the Bible there's one week left after the rapture to fulfill all these great things that's going to happen I don't really care what no man says the Bible says there's one week left after the rapture of the church we just proved that so whatever else that we think you need to take delight what brother said but now that becomes trash so what do you do with trash throw in the trash can okay the trash you thought before throw it in the trash can alright because there's the whole thing that's actually just watch I'll give you a key in that standard suite I stand there feet here's a whole key when brother Branham says and I got the quotes ready to bring them but not at this time he said seventy weeks that's seven years the whole of the 70 weeks 490 years is culminated in this one week right here all the other is dates and times and all the trees and branches and all of those stuff but this is where actually Israel gets her Redemption and the land and they build the temple they got to bring what to daniel thy people and the holy cities got to be built according to ezekiel 40 it can't be built right here you got a battle Armageddon look on your chart with that brother branham drew middle of week Armageddon just telling you what he said so according to the Bible Court of the prophets message so now they say no brother Brian brother Graham said no no no I didn't the last half of the week well the first half of the week good no you misunderstood what I said when brother asked him is seven years after the rapture II said no no no nenene I'll read the quote but now okay it can't be contrary to this he can't be this is the Word of God and he was a word prophet but now remember there was a messiah week that nobody realizes that there was three and a half years that Jesus preached over here there's three and a half years of Jesus preached here that's all that's one week so Jesus preached the first half of the week here he's preaching the last half of the week right here but people don't understand that they don't listen to what brother Graham says because you can't go contrary the Bible you cannot be a word prophet and be contrary to the Bible you can't so he was the word prophet I know he was there's no doubt he was so any quotes you bring me I'm just gonna say let's read revelation let's read Daniel 9 let's read let's read Daniel 9 and see if it fits your revelation or fits your quote but it won't because the Bible I got a lot of faith in this right here I don't like got a lot of faith in man that draws their own charts and makes their own don't even read this one brother he was so confused he read scripture that didn't even pertain to Daniel seventy weeks but you know what when you're a prizefighter or you think you're a prize fighter and you're up here going hey I got you buddy and then that guy goes oh you know the little guy the little guy goes like your daddy says you know you hits him in the hits him in the head what happens it makes him mad so what does he do that's what a real good fighter will do he'll get you mad right and you'll lose your composure you'll start flailing and all this and all he's gonna do is go and every time you start doing this he's gonna go poop that's the way God is with the devil he's got the devil some mad the devil start swinging everywhere and God just goes I'm gonna put some people on earth Satan and they're gonna help me so he puts you in the world on Monday and Satan's gonna be doing all this Danny you're gonna go Sadie's gonna go now that ain't I'll do bless his heart he can't win for losing he cannot win for losing and you know what he's not gonna win anyway he's a loser anyhow god bless you anybody have a need everything good feel good feel refreshed you want to sing one song where you won't go hallelujah is not an answer there's not an answer both dirty I'll think I like that I'll take that Halloween's not an answer uh-huh we'll just bow our heads then Louise can sing us a song get us out of here okay all right I mean you need I'll give more dance okay take them put them on somebody else too tell you what folks daddy had one of these in his pocket about 15 years ago and we were over in South Carolina hunting the guy walks up to us a real good friend of ours and he said I won't see you guys in November noticed he was pale kind of sickly looking he just went to the doctor and he had thought in his groin he had thought that he had what he call it where you tear you have a rupture or something hernia thank you he thought he had a hernia down in his groin area because they was bunk sticking out he had so much cancer in his prostate they give him three months to live three months University of Columbia over in South Carolina that hospital is where he went actually he worked over there went to the hospital they told him so you got three months to live go enjoy yourself we're not going to give you any chemo it's all OB so he said this was in February or March and he said I won't be able to see you in November he said I just want to tell you Bob and joy we and daddy said what what's wrong what's the problem he said well he said they've diagnosed me with cancer instead of giving me three months to live it it's all over me yeah it became a lot but he believed that but you know what daddy did he pulled the prayer cloths out of his pocket and I mean that thing to be real honest with you it was all dirty and been in there for years there probably but that really doesn't matter that really doesn't make any difference because he took that prayer cloth and he handed it to he handed it to Terry and he said I'll see you it he closed his hand he put it in his pocket he lived nine years nine years from a prayer cloth and every time we'd go hunting every time he'd go hunting he'd take that thing he go still got it still got it right here you've got it it's right here still got it so I don't have to pray for that you just don't see what's went on nine years the guy was he said they don't understand what happened he said they're trying to give me some kind of steroid to keep me he said keep me what he said I'm healed thank God he went to Alaska three years after that and went on a like a $10,000 what was it Richard a ram or some kind of RAM he had to like climb 12,000 feet I mean this guy was in good shape to have so much cancer he was in real good shape but he did die nine years later but you know what he tells you every time every he said I told them at the University of Columbia over in South Carolina he said I want to stay stood you the files over there if anybody wants to go see it he said I'll tell you where it's at he said he said it they don't know and kind of explained what happened he said but when he went back to have another checkup or went back again you know and the doctor I guess was looking at him like what are you doing here you only got three months to live checked him in there was zero zero cancer where a man was going to die in three months just by a man handed him a prayer cloth and telling him about it and saying what we we believe that's what the Bible says in written in acts 19 that they took the cloths off of Paul he said we believe this that we prayed over this prayer cloth and there's an anointing that goes on it and you can't wash it off no matter how much you wash it you can't wash it off but there was another anointing and there was a what there was a passage to get that to the guy it wasn't a tape recorder it was a person God is in people God can use all these facilities but God is in people and that connection he believed now this guy's not a believer he's not he wasn't even a Christian at the time I think he came on a little bit later and I reckon he kind of you know figured he'd better believe something but he was just a sinner him God but he always treated us very well very well never shunned Ritchie you hunted with didn't you something Terry yeah Malthus and his brothers still probably hunting over there but yeah he's just nine years the men left lived a good full of nine more years and then he finally passed away but you know what he links temporary the healing of the souls not though healing of the soul is eternal so when we hand you these prayer cloths you believe that that's gonna happen that it will happen to you just like it did to a man that wouldn't even believe it listen Donny walked brother Donny walked up here with belief all around him can't not believe he's seen it happen but what about a man that just was dying had no hope I believe if we took a picture of him he'd have that hood of death over him just like that woman in a picture brother branham that pronounced the woman had cancer remember and then because he was three months that demon had eat him up he went on he was real silent during the whole hunt he didn't say anything really cuz you know what God was doing something cuz I'm telling you the next time he went to the doctor that all was gone they said well we're gonna go ahead and give you some steroids just in case that you know what man will do they're gonna give you something but you just believe for that you take that with you to tonight this afternoon and you believe what God's already done you believe what God has already done in the Bible you believe what he's going to do cuz listen we always have to believe for the impossible hey why why do we need to believe that we're gonna get in the car and go home I mean we're just gonna walk out there and turn the key but we got to believe for the impossible we got to believe for a body change and you know what that's potential that's potential body change when you're healed that's the potential but what's gonna happen one - brother Karn it's gonna steamroll it's gonna not stop it's not good we're gonna well I'm healed but oh I feel sick tomorrow no it's gonna go oh man this is good I'm what Abraham Sarah Oh buddy you're good looking so are you girlfriend but that's where it's gonna be sure sure come on turn that home so he can Nala he's a pastor there in in in in Honduras and he's been sick for several years he had this he had problems with sugar diabetes very bad diabetic but something I forgot what it was but he was bloating and and he was just bedridden and so his son and some other some of the other ones that help helped him out in the church they were the ones who were taking the services and they were just praying for their pastor just bring for the pastor we went when we went during December I went back there to see him he would always still go to the services but he would have to lay in a bed the pastor of the church laying in the bed on the at the back of the church trying to listen in and he couldn't talk he could I mean he was just with his eyes closed it's almost like he was dead so I went back there and I said I said his name is brother at Nestor I said brother Ernesto can you hear me and he said he would acknowledge and he and so I gave him a prayer cloth and we played together the exact same prayer cloths that we use right here nothing different nothing different well his his son just messaged everybody all the believers and that they know him he's a vet he's well famous well-known pastor there and he he took video of his dad and his dad was sit sitting up and he's talking to the camera and he's saying like I appreciate everyone's prayers I mean it's but he's been sick for a long time he said I appreciate everyone's prayers and I appreciate it and so he said I believe the Lord's gonna raise me back up put me back in my post of duty and so I you know I believe it's all this the prayers of the Saints but hey I gave him a prayer cloth and maybe that anointing just just sits there right there and maybe you've ever changed things I don't know god man God's in control and then and we think God's not doing anything we're just so dry we just kind of just teach for an hour and a half or two hours and we go home and ain't nothing going on come on people brother branham told us he said the same anointing that that fourth church age had where they went into the lion's den he said that same anointing is on you just to make it through your daily your daily duties in other words paraphrasing that same anointing that kept that took them to let lines down and kept that anointing on them to be that fourth age it's the same anointing that you got on you to make it through your daily duties it's an overcoming just to get here so now we're coming just to come to church but then we get something from Gardner we get a little we get a little jolt oof you know well God did this for me and God did this for me we all have these different things that we testify of so it's just the way it is I mean yeah what do you think I know what people are looking for they're looking they're looking for God to just sweep across this building and everybody turn young and knit and tomorrow your boss is gonna love you and there's gonna be no traffic on the highway and your bills are gonna go somewhere else where's the victory in the whole thing but that's not what it is folks to make it through life no sure listen we got plenty you still got your Danny's have been under his watch for 15 years they ain't a bit of that anointing left you know what we said swinging we got to pray over amen anybody ever needs one they're right here in this cup I don't have to touch them you touch them you touch them you take some put some in your pocket I keep them in my pocket all the time and I always keep them in acts 19 a few of them that way I can handle my and in case I might need them cuz you know what this world needs what you got this world needs what you got it's time for us to let them know it let's bow our heads dear Heavenly Father lord thank you for this day sorry we've been here but Lord there's several million people set yesterday at football games for three hours and never moved and screamed at the top of their voice because their team was winning are they cried because their team was losing but Lord we're on the winning team we should be shouting all the time we should be able to sit and listen and and hear the Word of God come forth Lord for something that will help us in our daily walk in our daily duties father we pray that you'd be with us now and take care of us on the highways be with the ones that are sick that are not here the ones that are sin sick mainly Lord the ones that come in and out and wander back and forth and Lord put them on a rock put them on a rock that's what we're built on we're built on a rock-solid foundation and it's called the Word of God Father forgive us for being a little lengthy but we prayed that what we said Lord would be pleasing to you and the people will take this Lord for the weak and chew on it and we'll come back to see you on Wednesday night father
