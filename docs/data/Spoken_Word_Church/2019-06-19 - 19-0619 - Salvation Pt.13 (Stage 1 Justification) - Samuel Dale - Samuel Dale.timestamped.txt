[3:39] sins
[3:40] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[3:43] keep us in your love in Jesus name Amen
[3:48] they're not visitors they've been here
[3:50] before so we're glad to have the girls
[3:53] with us tonight amen
[3:55] seasons 2 we've been reading this for a
[4:00] while and probably keep on reading it
[4:02] for a while but maybe you'll learn what
[4:04] it means one of these days to for by
[4:07] grace are you saved through faith that
[4:11] not of yourselves it is the gift of God
[4:14] amen was so grace is a gift ok go to
[4:20] Romans 3 will read fronted verse 3:23
[4:25] for all have sinned and come short of
[4:27] the glory of God being justified freely
[4:29] by His grace through the redemption that
[4:32] is in Christ Jesus whom God has set
[4:35] forth to be a perpetuation through faith
[4:37] in his blood to declare his
[4:40] righteousness for the remission of sins
[4:42] that are past the notice remission of
[4:46] sins that are past there's no such thing
[4:49] as praying for sins in the future that's
[4:54] Catholicism that's the wrong doctrine
[4:57] right then why would we even think about
[5:02] it but sins that are past through the
[5:05] forbearance of God to declare I say at
[5:08] this time he is righteousness that he
[5:11] might be just and the justifier of him
[5:14] that which has which believeth in Jesus
[5:17] you may be seated the Lord at his
[5:19] blessing to the reading of the word now
[5:22] we've been over over and over in the
[5:27] services trying to get to a point in
[5:30] talking about salvation ok I'm a firm
[5:36] believer in salvation thank God for
[5:40] salvation thanking for his truth to
[5:43] reveal unto us but we had our concepts
[5:46] our thoughts of salvation when we were
[5:49] in organized religions and out in the
[5:52] war
[5:52] role in this worldly system of the
[5:54] church we had our thoughts and ideas of
[5:57] salvation and all of that and I believe
[6:01] God winked at our ignorance and you know
[6:05] led some to him but yet we look out
[6:09] there and see the whole religious world
[6:11] on tonight there's millions rejoicing
[6:16] services all around the world different
[6:19] things praising God but is he's our with
[6:23] them no that's a simple question to ask
[6:26] is he with them you know if he is then
[6:31] we need to find them to be able to go
[6:34] with them that's the best way I can put
[6:37] it you might not like my terminologies
[6:39] but you tell me some other better way of
[6:41] saying it if somebody else has more
[6:44] truth than we have we need to get to the
[6:46] truth that's the best that I've always
[6:49] taught and all that I believe alright
[6:51] let's see we know that Jonah 2 announces
[6:55] salvation is of the Lord all right we've
[6:59] been through over and over talking about
[7:01] salvation and to be an example of the
[7:06] natural birth as to be water blood and
[7:09] spirit to bring us to a natural example
[7:13] to understand the natural birth there
[7:16] and that would be able to understand a
[7:19] spiritual birth which would be water
[7:22] blood spirit or as we pick it up into
[7:26] the terminologies coming up into where
[7:28] we're at we're talking about
[7:32] justification sanctification and the
[7:36] baptism of the Holy Spirit all right now
[7:40] in doing that then we know that the
[7:43] Prophet taught it and he said he had
[7:46] always taught three stages he'd always
[7:50] taught it that away well I don't
[7:52] understand the people of the message
[7:53] saying now you know well it's just
[7:54] there's a when if we're gonna believe
[7:57] the Prophet and he says something and he
[8:00] gives us a direction all
[8:06] goddess into understanding the Word of
[8:10] God and bringing us to a place to be
[8:12] able to see God's Word unveiled before
[8:15] us then we should believe what he says
[8:18] and not what we think or what anybody
[8:23] else has taught because that way we're
[8:27] not depending upon God of the basis that
[8:31] he sent a prophet
[8:32] we're just playing along in the ranks of
[8:36] the message instead of believing it I
[8:38] believe that when we read the Prophet
[8:40] says this is where it is that's where
[8:42] I'll be you know I mean that's that's
[8:46] the whole thing's always been my way and
[8:48] my thoughts because that's what keeps it
[8:51] in that way and he said on the the
[8:54] future home paragraph 70 80 cities talk
[8:57] three processes are three stages of
[9:03] grace from the beginning well no matter
[9:07] what we think of how that it looks like
[9:10] this or it looks like that
[9:13] you know we have no right to think that
[9:17] we can change any of those things are
[9:20] that he was wrong in what he was saying
[9:24] we should settle down to the basis of
[9:27] saying what the Prophet said is the Word
[9:30] of God
[9:30] all right he said I believe that within
[9:33] why do we believe so much other stuff
[9:35] you know that goes around
[9:37] there's no need of doing it all right
[9:39] let's see three stages justification of
[9:42] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[9:44] Ghost he said he'd always taught it that
[9:47] way paragraph 86 of the future home
[9:51] always taught three processes well then
[9:58] we should be able to put our Christian
[10:00] journey into what the prophet has said
[10:05] and that's what I've been trying to
[10:06] bring to get us to see and ask the
[10:10] question
[10:11] do we have the biblical answer to what
[10:16] is the new birth
[10:17] do we have the Christian answer I mean
[10:22] through the prophets message and the
[10:23] Bible as to what is the new birth
[10:26] well I shouted I cried I spoke in
[10:29] tongues none of that is the new birth
[10:32] that's the aftereffect of the birth all
[10:35] right
[10:36] the baby getting here is the birth then
[10:40] the crying that things like that that is
[10:43] what happens after the baby gets here
[10:45] okay so I was a problem we got what the
[10:48] Prophet says all right in Ephesians 1 in
[10:52] 7 it talks about the forgiveness of sins
[11:00] Colossians 1 in 14 talks about the
[11:04] forgiveness of sin now we were to be the
[11:11] most elated people to think about that
[11:19] God has provided a way to bring us
[11:23] salvation alright but now he hasn't
[11:27] provided 20 different ways there's one
[11:33] way to salvation and that's through
[11:36] Jesus Christ faith in the blood that was
[11:40] shed for us to pay the price and in
[11:45] doing that only in our faith in the
[11:48] blood can our sins be remitted now
[11:54] remember what we've been through okay
[11:57] over it and over it what did the Prophet
[12:00] say he said you say you've accepted
[12:02] Jesus Christ he said but has he accepted
[12:06] you well I know he's accepted me cuz I'm
[12:11] all right
[12:12] that's between you and God but at that's
[12:16] appointed I've kept asking you because
[12:18] there's one thing for certain if what we
[12:22] believe about the new birth will not
[12:25] line up to the Bible
[12:29] and I'm talking about the Bible being
[12:31] the prophets message in the way he
[12:33] brought it and the understanding of the
[12:35] scriptures and and what were to bring if
[12:38] it doesn't line up with that we don't
[12:39] have the Newburgh well why wouldn't
[12:42] anybody want to be concerned enough
[12:44] about their own soul and how many times
[12:50] I've made this statement I'd rather go
[12:52] through life seeking God come down the
[12:55] end of the road and find out I had him
[12:57] all the time then to not seek him at all
[12:59] and find out at the end of the road I
[13:01] didn't have him well you can't tell me
[13:03] I've got him I've got him he's living in
[13:06] my heart and you know that's so does the
[13:09] Baptist the Methodist Presbyterian the
[13:11] brand of Mike's
[13:12] the Lula eyes all of them they've got
[13:17] some way of stating something about the
[13:22] new birth but now you don't hear people
[13:24] talk about justification sanctification
[13:29] the baptism with the Holy Ghost then
[13:34] your prophet said that is the new birth
[13:38] all right that was the first message
[13:41] that the Lord Jesus had when he said you
[13:45] must be born again all right and see
[13:48] them we think we've got it already
[13:50] figured out and when we think we've got
[13:52] it figured out just remember if it's
[13:55] right glory hallelujah but you know what
[14:01] you remember when you used to shout
[14:03] about the Trinity and thought it was
[14:05] true come on you were selling over back
[14:14] there thinking it was true all right but
[14:18] now what I want to approach it is what
[14:20] we read from Romans
[14:22] we're in 25 where it says for the
[14:26] remission of sins that are past there's
[14:32] no such thing as praying for future sins
[14:34] that would be I think the word is what
[14:36] novena is that it and the Catholic but
[14:39] anyhow it means you pray and you'd go
[14:41] down and tell the priest and give him
[14:43] money and and he remix your sins before
[14:45] you ever even sin alright now we don't
[14:49] believe in that we don't accept it in
[14:53] that way because there's nothing there
[14:54] to bring us to salvation alright so then
[14:58] we don't believe in the fact of it being
[15:01] something that we can pray before it
[15:05] ever happens no no that would that's
[15:08] impossible alright so they're our main
[15:12] point tonight is what forgiveness of
[15:14] sins that are past and then we're gonna
[15:17] read what the Prophet says it's a second
[15:19] so follow that thought and it's for sins
[15:23] that are past then we not should not
[15:26] even be concerned about trying to worry
[15:28] about the future you know we need to
[15:31] stay with the truth okay now listen to
[15:36] what your prophet says then we'll get
[15:40] back to earth all of what we're trying
[15:42] to bring so all right let's go to number
[15:44] three we've quoted number two and number
[15:46] three paragraph 78 brother Branham said
[15:49] he count but he comes to us through
[15:52] three stages I taught that at the
[15:54] beginning I've never changed since it's
[15:58] the Word of God
[15:59] alright now how many of us thought about
[16:03] the Word of God in relation to
[16:06] justification sanctification the baptism
[16:08] of the holy ghost when we were Baptist
[16:11] Methodist Presbyterian etc that didn't
[16:14] even teach those things we just teach
[16:17] them repentance it was all it was was
[16:21] come to the altar accept Jesus Christ as
[16:24] your Savior your your born-again
[16:27] Christian well now if that's true amen
[16:37] but now when your prophet makes a
[16:40] statement about something we should
[16:43] listen to that statement that he makes
[16:45] to see if we have the correct
[16:49] understanding of what he's saying okay
[16:51] go to number three on their names unless
[16:54] this reader ask you to read the future
[16:56] home
[16:58] and I just wondered have you read it but
[17:00] that's alright
[17:01] you read it over here anyway now the
[17:04] first step is repentance towards God
[17:09] then followers after that is water
[17:11] baptism water baptism repent be baptized
[17:15] in the name of Jesus Christ see water
[17:16] baptism followers showing that
[17:18] repentance was genuine are to remit our
[17:22] PI sins that has nothing to do with
[17:25] future sins now we remember we were
[17:29] going through it there's one thing for
[17:30] sure we don't believe in water baptism
[17:32] when to regeneration so he's not saying
[17:35] that water baptism remits our sins it's
[17:39] repentance repent and be baptized it's
[17:45] not you getting something without the
[17:47] repentance that repentance has got to be
[17:49] the first day so he says the first step
[17:51] is repentance toward God okay then we
[17:57] follow in the water baptism to show that
[18:00] our repentance it's genuine
[18:02] okay now there's we going through cause
[18:06] we're talking about in stage one of our
[18:08] Christian journey
[18:10] yeah brother Dale I just got it all at
[18:12] one time I've been over this and over
[18:14] this and over it you get tired of me
[18:18] going over and over but did you listen
[18:24] come on but look the mere hour PI sins
[18:31] that has nothing to do with the future
[18:36] what it only remits
[18:39] repent and be baptized in the name of
[18:41] Jesus Christ for what remission taking
[18:44] away of pi' sins has nothing to do with
[18:49] the future taking away of your PI sin
[18:54] but it has nothing to do with the future
[18:56] okay now listen it's just your sins has
[18:59] been chopped off what you did you can't
[19:03] repent for what Adam done II never done
[19:04] no you just get forgiveness for what
[19:08] you've done the old night
[19:10] is still dire no are you going to read
[19:19] what he says and believe what he says I
[19:21] believe your own thoughts and ideas
[19:22] about it he says it the old nature is
[19:27] still dire you've repented of your sins
[19:34] but he says the old nature is still dire
[19:38] well I've got some things in here where
[19:44] brother Branham says that if we think we
[19:46] believe that way if you read the future
[19:48] home he said and you are having immoral
[19:52] thoughts and things or your your
[19:54] thoughts is wrong and all I got and he
[19:56] says and they come back to you it's a
[19:57] good sign that didn't do any good you
[20:01] understand what I'm saying if something
[20:05] comes back in our lives that didn't stay
[20:07] away all right
[20:09] justification is the first stage of a
[20:13] Christian journey okay
[20:16] it's chopping off of your pie sins it's
[20:21] getting forgiveness of your sins it has
[20:25] nothing to do with your future and it
[20:29] does nothing to your nature come on well
[20:39] brother dad I went to the altar and I
[20:41] cried and I prayed and I had this great
[20:43] feeling I believe it now all these
[20:46] things happen I believe in that but you
[20:50] can do ever better that and still be
[20:52] lost what about going through all of the
[21:00] things of Judas Iscariot that went
[21:02] through justification and sanctification
[21:08] was lost what about you can go through
[21:15] justification and sanctification and be
[21:19] anointed on your spirit and have all
[21:24] of signs and wonders and life leavings
[21:27] and doing and preaching cast out devils
[21:30] and heal the sick and all of that and
[21:32] still be your prophet said lost now is
[21:40] that the way he taught it well I don't
[21:44] see how you could do all of that and be
[21:46] lost you talked to the Prophet talked to
[21:49] God about it
[21:50] Judas Iscariot done it run around said
[21:52] he did what you see we wanted art we
[22:00] won't shut them with self soaped idea of
[22:03] Christianity that doesn't bother our
[22:07] little petty feelings but see that will
[22:12] never work but what a wonderful thing to
[22:20] think about what a wonderful opportunity
[22:25] of a human moral to be able to call out
[22:31] on to God and God will hear his priors
[22:36] and forgive his sins
[22:47] but you see just because your sins are
[22:49] forgiven doesn't mean you're saved
[22:55] I'm saved
[22:57] cause my Sanders forgive having sinned
[23:00] any sense you see since your sins were
[23:02] forgiven and if you tell me you didn't
[23:05] I'm gonna tell you you're a liar and the
[23:06] Bible says you are for the sins plural
[23:11] I'm gonna just tell you upfront see
[23:13] there's no problem go to mine as well
[23:15] you're gonna either to leave or stay or
[23:17] whatever you're gonna do cuz you're
[23:18] gonna make up your own mind but I'm
[23:20] gonna tell you the truth your prophet
[23:24] said it had nothing to do with an with
[23:26] your nature to repent of your sins it
[23:31] just chopped off those sins would you
[23:33] know what I love about it how
[23:35] wonderfully it you realize see we spend
[23:38] half of our life praying about the sins
[23:40] we done know I'm a Mariah
[23:44] it's the biggest portion of your life in
[23:46] repentance been based upon something
[23:48] that was way back you under but just
[23:54] remember if God forgives you your sins
[23:57] he cannot bring those sins again against
[24:02] you because they're put in the seal
[24:04] forgetfulness what a wonderful Savior
[24:07] that would do that that would put our
[24:12] sins so far away until he can't remember
[24:15] it well if my sins is remitted and I'm
[24:21] saved
[24:23] okay you're saved but you know what
[24:28] brother brother Ryan said Judas was
[24:29] saved because Judas Essenes was remitted
[24:35] Judas become to sanctification we'll get
[24:38] to a word the unclean spirit goes out of
[24:40] nothing what you see we did we we've
[24:47] never heard it talked to us we've come
[24:51] down through things and nice like I said
[24:52] most of our most our Methodists Baptists
[24:55] or whatever we've never heard it talk of
[24:57] that you needed to come through just
[25:00] vacation sanctification - baptism with
[25:02] old ago well no your prophet did he's
[25:10] the one that said you're not saved but
[25:18] listen to what he's saying
[25:24] first step is repentance toward God then
[25:30] follows that is water baptism repent be
[25:33] baptized the name is Jesus Christ water
[25:35] baptism followers showing that
[25:38] repentance was genuine
[25:40] you remember how brought that out and
[25:41] dwelled on it so much
[25:42] what if you refuse to get baptized the
[25:45] name of the Lord Jesus Christ what if
[25:48] you refuse to get baptized in the name
[25:50] of the Lord Jesus right then God is not
[25:54] obligated to remit your sins is that
[26:02] right
[26:04] he's not obligated unless we follow his
[26:09] word but if we follow his word that he
[26:14] becomes obligated what's right and that
[26:18] has nothing to do you repentance is
[26:21] chopping that sin though that you've
[26:23] committed has nothing to do with the
[26:26] future well brother I've always just
[26:32] thought that I just went to the altar
[26:34] and said God save my soul and he saved
[26:37] my soul he give me the new birth he gave
[26:39] me everything I needed right there show
[26:42] me that in the Bible and the prophets
[26:43] message
[26:53] of just what time with you it took the
[26:57] disciples you don't like everyone but it
[27:00] it took on three and a half years to get
[27:04] to a situation enough that the Holy
[27:07] Ghost could come on yet they cast out
[27:11] Devils they heal the sick they done all
[27:13] kind of wonders and miracles and the
[27:16] Bible said they come back and said even
[27:18] the Devils are subject unto us what are
[27:25] you trying to tell me I'm lost
[27:27] no I'm trying to tell you what salvation
[27:31] really is salvation starts by a
[27:39] repentant heart the goodness of God the
[27:43] Bible says leads you to repentance we
[27:45] went through two services enough were
[27:48] that the basis of showing of the
[27:50] repentance part of it and that how God
[27:53] was calling you and the Bible says if
[27:55] God don't call you then you can't come
[28:00] you can't come this cause you won't -
[28:03] God has to call you that has nothing to
[28:13] do remits our high sins pull that back
[28:17] up brothers where I can read it at least
[28:20] number three join us your repentance
[28:24] with genuine are to remain our past sins
[28:28] that has nothing to do with future sin
[28:34] there's a direct statement huh it only
[28:37] remits
[28:38] repent and be baptized and I'm Jesus
[28:40] Christ what for remission taken away of
[28:42] pi' sins has nothing to do with the
[28:46] future I didn't say that he did yeah but
[28:55] you're not reading it right well oh come
[28:57] on
[28:57] anybody won't come up here read it I
[29:00] mean that's why I put them up here
[29:02] unless you read it because that out on
[29:05] the internet they can't argue
[29:06] at least it's up there I'm saying what
[29:10] he said code look what he gets down he
[29:11] chops off what to do you can't repent
[29:14] for what Adam done and all called you
[29:16] never done it Adam did you just got get
[29:19] forgiveness for what you've done the old
[29:22] nature is still there
[29:28] now you've repented of your sins
[29:31] you've asked God to forgive you of your
[29:33] sins but the old nature is still there
[29:36] so justification is not the new birth he
[29:49] said look now we went through that so
[29:50] don't come to me with anything Martin
[29:55] Luther nim had the new bird for their
[29:57] age of their time it was the age of
[30:01] justification there was the age of
[30:03] sanctification it's the age of the
[30:05] baptism when Oulu now is the age of the
[30:07] fully revealed word right but look look
[30:16] what he says then okay let's continue to
[30:20] read Oh so remember now we're looking
[30:24] for something to be able to say
[30:30] justification took this away but we're
[30:36] also looking for what it left no when I
[30:41] got saved I got say I learned you can't
[30:44] tell me I would have saved no you're
[30:49] telling your own self at you insight
[30:52] because you're not locking the way that
[30:54] I say what am I saying what the Prophet
[31:00] says it
[31:02] well that wasn't what he meant now you
[31:05] get over on that style and and this look
[31:11] now let's just do something with what he
[31:13] done tonight let's do a little bit with
[31:15] it
[31:17] so we go into paragraphs
[31:20] 89 of the future home he said let me
[31:24] take a board just a minute brother
[31:26] branham draws illustration on the
[31:27] blackboard now here's a human heart
[31:31] now I'm not I'm not a long ways from
[31:33] being an artist here's a human heart and
[31:36] here's a human heart now anybody knows
[31:38] that he draw the human heart and he draw
[31:40] the human heart
[31:42] right okay now watch him he drawled her
[31:49] human heart t2 human heart here's a
[31:53] human heart here's a human heart this
[31:55] one over here has a snake in it that's
[32:03] in who saw that mr. second retorted here
[32:08] he has his life he's describing one of
[32:12] those hearts and he's describing that in
[32:16] that heart is sin he's describing that
[32:19] in that heart is the snake the snake is
[32:25] the unclean spirit right we'll read that
[32:31] one second so don't worry about it but I
[32:34] didn't know no snake in me what did you
[32:38] have he's born in sins having an
[32:42] iniquity spouting mother's womb went for
[32:44] the liar what was in you yeah but I come
[32:52] with this seed in me see all that went
[32:53] in there to deteriorate away from the
[32:56] teaching of the new birth there was a
[33:00] purpose for that all that being brought
[33:01] out was to stop the new birth from being
[33:04] talked I don't have to go through
[33:10] Jessica st. fix batch control I believe
[33:12] the prophets message if you believe the
[33:14] prophets message that's what we're
[33:15] reading so now you just made your own
[33:19] self a liar look you're tough look tough
[33:24] what are you come on
[33:29] this one here has a snake in it that's
[33:33] in here he has his life this one over
[33:38] here has a dove in it which is the holy
[33:42] spirit here he has life will this one
[33:46] here
[33:47] he has malice hatred Envy that's what's
[33:51] causing it is that fella here what's
[33:58] causing the hatred the envies the
[34:03] problem that fella
[34:04] what fellow the snake then clean spirit
[34:12] okay well shortness a second come on
[34:16] well this one over here had love and joy
[34:19] and long-suffering that's what does it
[34:21] down here now watch it now when you
[34:24] asked now listen do your repentance when
[34:30] you ask are you are forgiven of your
[34:34] sins the whole don't you only done this
[34:43] now what you do taken that away taking
[34:49] what away what's the other picture is it
[34:51] just a second line but the thing that
[34:55] made you do it
[34:57] is still there you mean when you ask God
[35:02] to forgive you of your sins and he
[35:06] chopped your sins totally off if he
[35:09] didn't come right down and fill you with
[35:11] the Holy Ghost you still have the devil
[35:14] inside of you call the snake I don't
[35:22] know that's what I'm saying you turn
[35:27] down the very word that can save you
[35:37] but the thing that made you do it
[35:40] is spilled our that's the old root of
[35:42] evil it's still there notice in your
[35:47] baptized never forgive you what you for
[35:49] your sins now let's pull up that drawing
[35:52] we made a drawing now it's not brother
[35:55] branham's drawing we made a drawing to
[35:58] represent uh-huh so what is mankind when
[36:06] he's born in sin seven iniquity he's
[36:10] went forth the liar he's a sinner
[36:12] what is he who's this guy the old root
[36:25] of evil the unclean spirit Jesus spoke
[36:31] up goes out of a man father wall because
[36:34] that's sanctification see that's the
[36:36] next message alright look sin What did
[36:42] he say over here he said here is a man
[36:48] he said he's got a unclean spirit the
[36:52] root of evil is still in him and said
[36:55] he's got sin huh
[37:00] what does justification do to that
[37:02] person it only remits his sins now come
[37:12] on we just read the Prophet said their
[37:15] old root of evil don't go out it's still
[37:18] there what caused you to do it it's
[37:21] still there all right now your sin so
[37:26] remember he's saying these little things
[37:28] you go back and you read it the little
[37:34] things you see what do you draw this is
[37:36] seeing little lines okay pull it to the
[37:39] next stage what do we see when you
[37:43] repent of your sins what has happened
[37:46] this guy's still dark
[37:48] that's what your prophet just said now
[37:51] come on read it you got the quotes in
[37:52] front of you faith
[37:58] tries to replace the basis of our sin
[38:02] because that's where sin has gone out by
[38:05] faith in the blood of Jesus Christ so
[38:10] that sin that we had is taken out by the
[38:16] blood of Jesus Christ by faith in God's
[38:19] Word it brings us to a place called
[38:23] justification which really all
[38:28] justification does he's chops off your
[38:30] pie sins it does nothing to your nature
[38:33] we just read it future home
[38:37] that unclean spirit is still left that
[38:41] old root of evil I'll save you a little
[38:46] trouble when you start to don't try to
[38:49] look up root of evil in the Bible you
[38:50] won't you won't find it exactly the way
[38:53] but around me uses the wording I like
[38:55] the way he uses wording the unclean
[38:59] spirit is in the Bible but the root of
[39:02] evil is a little different so I'm just
[39:05] telling you try to save you a little
[39:06] trouble and to help you but I don't you
[39:10] know but look see you've asked God to
[39:13] forgive your sins and your sins are
[39:16] remitted by faith in the blood but what
[39:24] caused you to do it is still there
[39:34] see that unclean spirit stays in there
[39:38] just because you're repented of your
[39:40] sins because God forgive your sins and
[39:43] doesn't make it straight
[39:45] come on your back back up let's back up
[39:48] and do it come on go back over brothers
[39:51] so that people won't say well brother
[39:53] Dale you done this then back up to
[39:55] number three and let's reread you got
[39:57] your quotes laying in front of you let's
[39:59] reread it all right and see if what I
[40:04] was saying about this part over here
[40:05] that the sin goes out but the unclean
[40:09] spirit the thing that calls you to sin
[40:11] is still in you even though your sins
[40:14] are remitted because it doesn't remit
[40:18] future sins you got to get forgiveness
[40:24] every day of your sins even after you're
[40:29] born again Paul taught a daily
[40:33] sanctification a daily cleansing after
[40:42] you're born again come on first step
[40:48] repentance towards God and father's
[40:50] after that water baptism why do I have
[40:52] to repent be baptized in the name of
[40:53] Jesus Christ see water baptism father's
[40:55] showing that repentance was genuine are
[40:58] to remit our PI sins has nothing to do
[41:01] with the future sin it all they're in
[41:06] remits
[41:08] repent and be baptized the name of Jesus
[41:10] by offering this is taken away if PI
[41:13] sins has nothing to do with the future
[41:17] does that enough just your sins has been
[41:22] chopped off what you did you don't have
[41:25] to repent for this Adam enough the old
[41:27] nature is still dire
[41:37] come on go to 89 to the next one I'm
[41:44] gonna 88 go to 89 let's take a board
[41:49] just for a moment brother run the
[41:51] drawers of the board here is a human
[41:53] heart no no no no you know here's a
[41:55] human heart and here's a human heart
[41:58] number one heart has a snake in it no is
[42:06] that in the drawing that we the snake is
[42:08] still there even though you've repented
[42:10] that's what he just said here's a human
[42:16] heart this one over here has a snake in
[42:18] it that's sin now it's not just to say
[42:22] the snake is sin to me when he says that
[42:24] sins that's in little whittlin things
[42:26] that we took out over there before that
[42:29] was called sin that's sin does nothing
[42:35] to the nature of the person just look
[42:37] back at your drawing and you'll see it
[42:38] changed from sin to faith right here he
[42:49] has his life this one over here has a
[42:51] dove in it which is a Holy Spirit here
[42:54] he has a life that's a human being a
[42:57] life is a human being right and one of
[43:00] these human beings that are sneaking him
[43:02] the other human being had a dove in him
[43:07] then we got to get rid of the snake you
[43:12] can't have the Dove and the snake in the
[43:15] same place I know you don't like it but
[43:20] that's why I never did like the two so
[43:21] people cuz they said God gives you a
[43:23] soul say can give you so Bart brother
[43:25] Ron said Satan cannot create he can't
[43:27] give you a show so that's automatically
[43:29] out come on
[43:34] well this one here has malice now which
[43:37] one then two adds malice the one with
[43:39] the snake has malice Envy in the end
[43:43] what that's what's causing it is this
[43:45] fella here what's called the fella the
[43:48] snake
[43:49] what's causing
[43:51] to go wrong the snake ain't got no snake
[43:55] in me I'm talking about the devil as the
[44:02] snake the Prophet is talking about the
[44:06] devil as a snake not you've got a snake
[44:08] inside of your soul
[44:09] come on well this one over here has love
[44:18] joy that's easy to tell which ones which
[44:20] and look and that's what does it down
[44:24] here what does it what makes this one
[44:27] how love and joy the death what makes
[44:32] this one have malice and hatred and the
[44:34] snake okay come on then when you're
[44:41] asked it works when you repent of your
[44:44] sins now when your ass are your forgiven
[44:48] of your sins you only done this now
[44:52] watching taking that away what did it
[44:54] take away sin seems only thing that went
[45:02] out of justification come on that's what
[45:05] your prophet is saying taken that away
[45:09] what sin whatever you ought to make you
[45:12] draw it and do this out of the other way
[45:13] you do what you want to but just
[45:15] remember read what he says don't do like
[45:19] we've done one time in him ministers
[45:21] meeting and there was two authentic
[45:23] papers that brother Branham had put out
[45:26] and this brother come up and wrote this
[45:29] other one born he made this and
[45:31] everybody I said any nothing more a
[45:34] prophet had to say that's what he had to
[45:37] say he didn't care what the prophets say
[45:40] come on you're forgiven of your sins you
[45:45] only done this taking that away once you
[45:47] take away sin sin flick it back over to
[45:56] where we watch where we can get it and
[45:57] what does it wind up in and now the
[46:01] click of
[46:03] the heart number yeah there dia see we
[46:12] took our sin and tried to put something
[46:14] else in place what because your sin goes
[46:17] out through the faith that is in the
[46:19] blood of Jesus Christ you agree to that
[46:23] not your risk not sure what you do or
[46:26] how you do that it's the repentance for
[46:31] the sin justification alright jump back
[46:34] to where we were now back home number
[46:38] four again and when you asked you are
[46:44] forgiven of your sins you only done this
[46:46] taking that away but the thing that made
[46:48] you do it is still there that's the old
[46:54] root of evil it's still there so after
[46:59] you are repented of your sins if you
[47:04] don't immediately go straight through
[47:06] into the baptism with the Holy Ghost and
[47:08] brother Branham said very few people
[47:11] will that's his words that's not sorry
[47:17] if we don't get something there we ain't
[47:21] drove that thing out yet it's still in
[47:24] that you repent of your sins you what it
[47:27] alter you cried you prayed you said I
[47:29] Love You Lord
[47:29] oh that's wonderful forgive me my sins
[47:32] all that's great
[47:33] but that didn't take that unclean spirit
[47:36] out I didn't say that I just don't like
[47:46] your attitude anyway I don't like yours
[47:49] either so what does that do
[47:50] does that solve any problems then when
[47:57] you ask you're only forgiving your sins
[47:59] you're only done this taking that away
[48:02] but the thing that made you do it is
[48:04] still there that's the old root of evil
[48:08] it's still there
[48:13] so now remember the disciples believed
[48:20] on the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior
[48:23] I'm quoting brother Branham part of us
[48:25] in the future home almost verbatim word
[48:28] the disciples repented of their sins but
[48:34] it took sanctification to drive out the
[48:36] unclean spirit right he took st. John
[48:41] 17:17 I think's right to do what now
[48:50] come back with a heart okay
[49:00] after you repented of your sins the
[49:02] whole thing that made you do it it still
[49:04] though you don't like it I can tell on
[49:07] the faces I can read places I don't have
[49:09] to read I don't how to our discernment I
[49:12] can read faces when your face goes from
[49:18] somewhere in there there's some
[49:20] different okay that's her business
[49:24] the Prophet says what made you do it is
[49:27] still there okay
[49:33] then what we're gonna do with that guy
[49:35] how are we gonna get him out the one of
[49:42] these days you're gonna understand why
[49:44] brother Dale emphatically keep stating
[49:47] ever service almost the new birth is the
[49:51] birth of the word only the birth of the
[49:53] word is gonna drive the devil out of you
[49:58] did you listen only the birth of the
[50:01] word can drive the devil out no we lay
[50:03] hands on the cast them out show me in
[50:08] the Bible where the disciples had to
[50:11] have hands laid on them and catch the
[50:14] devil out of them to get the new birth
[50:18] they didn't have to lay hands on the
[50:20] 3000 outside and get them to go through
[50:23] those stages cast the devil out of him
[50:26] they didn't have to do it at the house
[50:27] the canoes it was the word that drove
[50:32] the devil out it's the word right now
[50:35] that'll drive the devil out of me and
[50:36] you and only the word that unclean
[50:41] spirits gonna stay there until we
[50:43] realize what number one that it's dark
[50:45] right good if you don't believe it's
[50:50] dark
[50:51] you ain't gonna ask God to forgive you
[50:52] okay go ahead to the next one that we
[50:55] got wanted to that number pull up the
[50:59] next one it takes a snake out
[51:02] sanctification
[51:07] is the unclean spirit just drove out of
[51:11] the man that's sanctification you said I
[51:16] don't know okay read number seven go to
[51:21] number seven keep it in mind now we got
[51:24] him clean how does he get clean a notice
[51:29] sanctification the third stage second
[51:32] stage of it cleanses the mind sets the
[51:35] heart the mind of the heart in order of
[51:39] holiness the cleansing about by the word
[51:44] washed by the water of the word come on
[51:48] and a man can repent of sins he's still
[51:52] thinking of now listen to what he's
[51:55] describing maybe he's an immoral man now
[52:00] this is justification come on
[52:03] a man can repent of his sins
[52:06] justification the moral woman looking
[52:12] warmer he fights is still there maybe
[52:17] he's a drunkard every time he smells a
[52:20] drink it's still dire justification
[52:30] don't take the snake out it don't take
[52:33] out what's causing you to do those
[52:34] things wrong it only chops off the sins
[52:38] of that person that has you've committed
[52:40] the pi's listen but when he gets
[52:45] sanctified cleanse and set aside for
[52:52] service right that cleanses that desire
[52:57] out of him the desire for the woman to
[53:01] desire for the drinking it's going out
[53:03] what by
[53:09] you oughta know and realize what I'm
[53:11] fixing to say is God's honest truth and
[53:13] following you face and cry out for
[53:14] things you realize that when God
[53:18] remitted your sins he was standing right
[53:21] there to cleanse us of all things and
[53:26] take away all of those things he was
[53:28] there to do it right then but we didn't
[53:31] have anybody to help us really or to
[53:33] know what to do ourselves but you know
[53:36] yourself now listen can I quote some of
[53:38] your experiences some of you've told
[53:41] your experiences to me
[53:42] I'm of even wrote them out so he does
[53:44] what that in your life you realized that
[53:47] you come to a knowledge within you of
[53:52] how wrong it was and you ask God to
[53:57] forgive you and a great spirit of relief
[54:02] come upon you that unclean spirit is
[54:07] going out but just remember now if you
[54:14] don't keep him out he's coming back and
[54:18] the Bible says his state in the second
[54:20] is seven times I believe seven I worse
[54:23] than the first you realize where we're
[54:29] at for cleanses that desires out of him
[54:36] it takes a want of it away and watch him
[54:40] I love the Prophet he knows what the
[54:42] human element is it takes the way the
[54:45] one of it just because you get the one
[54:48] of it going don't think you can go back
[54:50] and just take that well we don't bother
[54:52] me to go into a beer joint and and and
[54:55] sit around and talk to them about the
[54:57] Lord while they drank their beer you
[55:01] pour human you're as bad as the guy was
[55:06] at work he didn't drink he didn't do
[55:10] things but ever not them guys and go to
[55:13] the liquor store
[55:14] I'm not joking you know
[55:18] he come back with a bottle they had a
[55:20] bottle this was a coke Thurs was liquor
[55:29] asked him one day I said if I'm standing
[55:31] out in front of the place and I'm
[55:34] looking and you and your buddy comes out
[55:36] you got a brown sack and he's got a
[55:39] brown sack how am I gonna know who's
[55:40] drinking beer or liquor or whatever I
[55:43] said you've got it in your heart you
[55:45] want to drink but you also know your
[55:48] wife will kick you out the door if you
[55:50] do that was his honest as I could say to
[55:55] the man because that was exactly what
[55:57] was happening he wanted to drink but he
[56:00] had enough control I said why don't you
[56:03] just go in and come walking back out
[56:05] when no beer can no brown paper bag then
[56:10] he knew I was hitting him right see it
[56:15] takes a wall of it away he can still be
[56:17] tempted but he takes the wall of it away
[56:24] still even though he takes a wound of it
[56:27] away now what's he saying
[56:28] still he's not right yet cuz he ain't
[56:34] got the vessel fool then he is baptized
[56:41] with the Holy Ghost and fire why does it
[56:44] say it like that Holy Ghost and fire
[56:45] firing the Holy Ghost you'll get to that
[56:49] one these years then the baptized with
[56:52] the Holy Ghost and fire cleanse burn out
[56:54] cleaned up and then put into the service
[56:56] of sanctification only sets them aside
[56:59] for service
[57:04] what about it church
[57:08] what's the sanctification gets rid of
[57:12] that unclean spirit what your prophet
[57:17] says go back and read over and over do
[57:19] you get what he's saying it takes out
[57:22] the won't of those things but yet it
[57:25] doesn't fill you up now how many of you
[57:32] can remember when you got saved you went
[57:36] to the altar then you got up from there
[57:38] and you and listen search I'm trying to
[57:41] be honest the best I can but you've got
[57:44] up crying and praying and thanking God
[57:47] for saving you and you went home and for
[57:55] awhile you've done okay but after a
[57:59] while you started easing back again
[58:03] smoking or drinking or something see
[58:09] what you've done is what has happened
[58:11] the Bible says the unclean spirit will
[58:14] come back - now listen let's see if I
[58:19] can get it he comes back to his house
[58:27] you know that you know the Bible says
[58:33] that
[58:41] I didn't give these that's okay Matthew
[58:46] 12:40 for their 43
[58:54] well the unclean spirit is going out of
[58:56] a man he walketh in Dry places seeking
[58:59] rest and find us not then he says I will
[59:02] return into my house from whence I came
[59:09] out and when he comes he finds an empty
[59:16] and guard swept and garnished luke says
[59:20] and when the unclean spirit is going out
[59:22] of him in walking drop away
[59:23] - nothing returning to my house which I
[59:27] came out my house this used to be the
[59:34] house of the devil our very body being
[59:43] the vowel body soul and spirit was lost
[59:52] we belong to Satan remember in the Book
[59:57] of Ruth when they come down through the
[1:00:00] earth that they was one closer canden
[1:00:02] than boys that's the devil brother
[1:00:08] Branham said was closer kin to you and
[1:00:10] me hope it don't don't strip hurt my
[1:00:13] kids my kids don't need to learn these
[1:00:16] things why do they need to learn setting
[1:00:20] up a sex education let him learn send
[1:00:29] him to school and let him learn and I
[1:00:32] ain't against to go into school but you
[1:00:35] know what I just said is right
[1:00:37] they teach them in school what they want
[1:00:40] them to know
[1:00:47] so go ahead do you want to know the plan
[1:00:52] of salvation or do you want to know your
[1:00:55] don't you are you satisfied with your
[1:00:57] own ideas and thoughts the unclean
[1:01:01] spirit goes out of a man when it do I
[1:01:06] sprang that one up before it's pure and
[1:01:08] clean put one more in that one rang up
[1:01:14] the soul which he'll back up one there
[1:01:19] you go
[1:01:21] root of evil goes out
[1:01:24] Matthew Coyle the soldier scripture the
[1:01:27] unclean spirit sanctification executive
[1:01:30] is not truth thy Word is truth and
[1:01:31] that's what you got but that's the most
[1:01:36] dangerous stage to any Christian that
[1:01:40] has ever been because if you don't get
[1:01:44] that fool fast quick Satan's coming back
[1:01:58] there's only one way to drive him out
[1:02:03] see I never knew these things when I was
[1:02:06] a quick I mean become finally a
[1:02:08] Christian 18 years of age when I joined
[1:02:10] the Baptist Church I didn't know
[1:02:12] anything about wash by the water of the
[1:02:15] word know things but I had a desire in
[1:02:20] my heart to know God's Word I had a
[1:02:25] desire to know his word to study it to
[1:02:30] read it and try to understand it I
[1:02:39] started reading the word you know how to
[1:02:44] keep a devil out read God's Word and
[1:02:47] quote that word back to the devil you
[1:02:52] want him to be grow out and keep him out
[1:02:54] just keep quoting the word back to them
[1:02:56] then you know what I say say I know and
[1:03:00] I'm quoting brother Branham no human
[1:03:02] mortal can withstand the devil right you
[1:03:06] need that quote that's a par phrase it's
[1:03:08] close very close no human being is a
[1:03:11] match for the devil oh but brother
[1:03:18] Branham was if that demon hadn't got a
[1:03:23] hold of me when I was 12 years old I
[1:03:26] would have been converted that's a
[1:03:28] direct quote your prophet just said oh
[1:03:36] you mean brother Branham had a demon in
[1:03:39] that yeah so do you
[1:03:46] at a snake just like the rest of us but
[1:03:52] by being a prophet he knew how to handle
[1:03:54] God's word Satan comes to you and starts
[1:04:00] telling you how dirty your best thing do
[1:04:02] disagree with him because if you
[1:04:05] with him they're gonna do no good he's
[1:04:08] the author of a fuss you know what I
[1:04:10] mean
[1:04:10] he loves it that way don't argue with it
[1:04:14] just say Satan you're right but said
[1:04:17] Jesus Christ saved my soul and he says
[1:04:20] here in the word if I believe and accept
[1:04:24] him he'll take care of everything that I
[1:04:27] do or have done he'll cover it all and
[1:04:32] he'll cleanse me see that unclean spirit
[1:04:39] it's got to be taken out because that's
[1:04:41] the old root of evil that's the snake
[1:04:46] that according to the Book of Ruth that
[1:04:49] was more tend to us than Jesus Christ
[1:04:53] right because we're born kinfolks to the
[1:04:59] devil I just don't understand you you
[1:05:05] just make things just too plain to blow
[1:05:12] in this world's over with I'll have my
[1:05:16] reward because I can stand before every
[1:05:20] one of you at judgment and declare I
[1:05:24] tried to tell you the truth
[1:05:28] I tried filer yeah failure always a
[1:05:35] failure yeah
[1:05:38] brother Dale do you do you live a good
[1:05:40] life no no it takes Christ to be a
[1:05:43] Christian
[1:05:44] I don't see my brother instead takes God
[1:05:46] to be a crazy God to be or they say and
[1:05:50] Christ be a Christian it's one way or
[1:05:52] the other you see that's why that
[1:05:56] unclean spirit has got to be driven out
[1:05:58] but you've got to get something in the
[1:06:00] place of it now those disciples for
[1:06:07] three and a half years had that demon
[1:06:10] drove out of them
[1:06:19] one day God came to live we'll get back
[1:06:25] into it you read the future home study
[1:06:27] it listen to it see this world has come
[1:06:32] through justification right and land the
[1:06:36] future home the days of Noah it was
[1:06:38] washed by the water in the days of the
[1:06:41] Lord Jesus the blood dropped back upon
[1:06:43] the earth to cleanse and claim it one of
[1:06:46] these days is gonna get a fire baptism
[1:06:48] let's see what I love about it
[1:06:51] we've already stepped ahead because we
[1:06:55] can already go through justification
[1:06:58] sanctification the baptism with the Holy
[1:07:00] Ghost and stand here and say we are the
[1:07:06] redeemed it's not what you and I can do
[1:07:12] is not it it's what he's already done
[1:07:18] brother Dale do you ever do wrong you
[1:07:20] ever have a wrong thought I stand right
[1:07:23] here preaching and then things bounce
[1:07:25] off I'm human
[1:07:34] what I do thank you lord thank you let
[1:07:42] me know where I stand you know you have
[1:07:48] wrong thoughts can I quote the Prophet
[1:07:52] brother Branham do you sin he said every
[1:07:57] day the Bible says for the sins of the
[1:08:07] people
[1:08:08] brother Ron said sinners don't have sins
[1:08:11] they have sinned sinners don't house-sit
[1:08:16] sins they have sinned Christian how sins
[1:08:23] the devil comes that he brings sin
[1:08:30] and God remits our sins what about a
[1:08:34] wonderful Savior can tell us all of that
[1:08:37] and tell us how easy it is and all we
[1:08:40] got to do is just accept him as I say it
[1:08:49] one more time let's don't be just too
[1:08:51] foolish about it
[1:08:53] because we think we got it made you
[1:08:56] better be careful I'll guarantee you one
[1:09:00] thing when you think you got one devil
[1:09:02] defeated you better look around behind
[1:09:07] it because there's another one real
[1:09:11] close and he's gonna do everything he
[1:09:15] can to take it place me that's what it
[1:09:20] takes the born-again experience to feel
[1:09:22] the vessel the baptism with the Holy
[1:09:28] Ghost feels the vessel the new bird
[1:09:31] feels the vessel that Satan can't come
[1:09:33] back
[1:09:36] come on musician think on these things
[1:09:41] what is the first stage of Christianity
[1:09:45] justification chopping off our Pisceans
[1:09:49] asking God to cleanse us and goddess
[1:09:53] repentance and guidance and Happiness
[1:09:55] Lord be with us and take care of us Lord
[1:09:59] forgive me help me I'm having a lot of
[1:10:03] problems
[1:10:08] you see when he comes in saving can't
[1:10:13] stay there so if you want the unclean
[1:10:15] spirit out ask God in if you don't have
[1:10:21] God in the unclean spirit is still there
[1:10:27] remember it can only be driven out by
[1:10:31] the power of the revealed word it ain't
[1:10:38] you quitting come on you know what I'm
[1:10:43] talking about
[1:10:44] you quit this you quit that next day you
