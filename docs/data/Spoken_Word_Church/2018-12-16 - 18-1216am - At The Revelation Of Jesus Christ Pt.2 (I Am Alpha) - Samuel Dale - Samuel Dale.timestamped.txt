[0:00] bending your hands and just have your
[0:01] way and lead us by thy grace and father
[0:04] got us less reliant sister Rebecca their
[0:08] Lord just review a brother with sister
[0:11] Kathy's mother be with all the others
[0:13] that are sick among us we pray that you
[0:16] would bless each one got us in Jesus
[0:18] name I didn't give you the scripture but
[0:22] they'll throw them up in a hurry first
[0:24] Peter 1 and then we'll go to revelations
[0:27] 1 alright so we'll go to her I told you
[0:35] we're gonna try to make a point and go
[0:38] through a series maybe on the church
[0:40] ages and things and come up through so
[0:44] but we're starting it and we'll be using
[0:46] this for the reference to it because of
[0:49] what is said in Revelations 1 and then
[0:53] what we're going back to Peter alright
[0:55] let's go to Peter 1:7 that's a trial of
[0:59] your faith being much more precious than
[1:02] of gold at purchase though it be tried
[1:05] with fire I'll be found unto praise and
[1:07] honor and glory were at the appearing of
[1:10] Jesus Christ now there's a difference
[1:12] than appearing in the coming right see
[1:15] he's appeared he can appear right over
[1:17] here he could appear over here in this
[1:19] church if somebody's healed over there
[1:21] you know he's dark alright that can be
[1:24] his appearing and see then his coming is
[1:27] the revealing of God's Word all right
[1:29] the world can benefit from his appearing
[1:34] because the healings and the signs and
[1:38] the wonders and the thing out there is
[1:40] because he paid the price but the bride
[1:42] is the only one that's involved in his
[1:46] coming so there is a difference in
[1:48] appearing in the coming okay whom have
[1:51] having not seen you love in whom though
[1:54] now you see him not yet believing you
[1:58] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[2:02] glory receiving the end of your faith
[2:04] even the salvation of your souls of
[2:07] which salvation the prophets now
[2:09] remember our point Hebrews 13:8 same in
[2:12] the Old Testament
[2:13] I'm in the knew of which salvation the
[2:16] prophets have been inquired and searched
[2:19] diligently who profits out of the grace
[2:21] that should come unto you seeing what or
[2:25] what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
[2:28] which was in them did signify Christ in
[2:32] every verse right when it testified
[2:34] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[2:37] the glory that should follow and to whom
[2:39] it was revealed that not unto themselves
[2:41] but unto us they did minister the thing
[2:45] things which are now reported unto you
[2:48] by them that have preached the gospel
[2:51] unto you with the Holy Ghost now not
[2:55] just their own doing but with the Holy
[2:57] Ghost sent down from heaven which think
[3:00] the angels desire to look into wherefore
[3:02] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[3:05] and hope to the end for the grace that
[3:08] is to be brought unto you at the
[3:11] revelation of Jesus Christ go to pirate
[3:14] page 45 Christ some history we'll get to
[3:18] it eventually be literal explains that
[3:21] okay
[3:21] now let's go over to revelations 1 and
[3:27] it says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[3:29] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[3:33] servants things which must shortly come
[3:35] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[3:38] his angel unto his servant John who by
[3:42] record of the word of God and the
[3:44] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[3:46] things that he saw blessed is he that
[3:49] readeth and they that hear the words of
[3:51] this prophecy and keep those things
[3:54] which are written therein for the time
[3:57] is at hand I wrote in my Bible alone you
[3:59] may be seated I wrote in my Bible a long
[4:01] time ago time to understand I believe
[4:06] that I believe it's time to understand
[4:09] all right
[4:10] the hour that we're living okay now what
[4:14] was our thought we would just stay on
[4:16] this point this morning because we won't
[4:19] be having an evening service we'll be
[4:20] cutting it short in a minute so we just
[4:22] you know kind of stay with the point
[4:24] that we were trying to bring out
[4:26] Wednesday night
[4:28] of doing that you know talking about
[4:32] where the Prophet says it that before I
[4:37] show you anything
[4:39] paragraph 143 the Patmos vision they can
[4:43] pull it up as number one and then we got
[4:45] a 180 we're gonna start with but before
[4:47] I show you anything I want to let you
[4:51] know who I am nothing that marvelous he
[4:57] doesn't want us to get confused about
[5:01] who it is doing the talking now I say
[5:06] there is mass confusion in the people of
[5:10] the message trying to understand the
[5:14] Book of Revelations especially just
[5:16] these first few verses and there's mass
[5:20] confusion about who this is and what
[5:23] that is and who said this and who said
[5:25] what we will eventually get into that
[5:29] but to me this is the point the Prophet
[5:33] said if you don't understand undecided
[5:37] the greatest of all revelation is a
[5:38] deity of this this the deity the supreme
[5:41] deity of our Lord Jesus if you can't you
[5:44] can't get the first base until you
[5:45] believe that all right we can't get
[5:49] nowhere until we believe you know the
[5:51] revelation of Jesus Christ this is not
[5:53] the revelation brother instead of John
[5:57] all right so it's not the revelation of
[6:00] any other man except the revelation of
[6:04] Jesus Christ
[6:06] now it's marvelous and wonderful the
[6:10] hour we live in that God has brought us
[6:13] the message all right but I made a
[6:18] couple of statements there Wednesday
[6:20] night to just to set your thought in a
[6:22] line to her that see you you you try to
[6:26] go through the book of Revelation you
[6:27] wind up and there's a lot of breeches
[6:29] remember the Prophet said there's a
[6:31] breach between the church ages and the
[6:33] seals there's a breach between the book
[6:35] of Acts like in in the church ages
[6:38] there's many breaches there are gaps and
[6:42] they must be filled in by the Word of
[6:46] God all right
[6:47] in the correct order to make sure it
[6:50] falls and we understand all right now so
[6:54] he says now I want you to know who I am
[6:57] what was our thought that we cover one
[6:59] true and living God wanna know who I am
[7:03] before he continues on he wants us to
[7:07] know who he is
[7:08] all right we tried to cover some things
[7:11] on one God and all like that of knowing
[7:14] this is not a second person or a third
[7:16] person he's really not even the first
[7:19] person Jesus is the person of God all
[7:24] right
[7:24] see now if we get that correct and we
[7:27] follow the line up we won't have no
[7:30] problems when we get over into the
[7:34] scriptures and we run into something and
[7:38] we stop we were listening to a tape last
[7:41] night and I can't remember it I know it
[7:43] was Hebrews chapter one I know that but
[7:47] brother Branham was saying something
[7:49] there and what he said
[7:53] physically speaking to the mind you know
[7:56] what you hear was actually wrong because
[8:03] the way he said it so you could take
[8:07] that lay it out over here and say well
[8:10] he said this alright but it's like I've
[8:15] always tried to get you to think about
[8:19] the before and the after explains what
[8:23] he's talking about so when you're
[8:26] reading the Bible read it and look at
[8:29] the before and the after
[8:31] well I just say what it says see we can
[8:33] do that there church that don't in
[8:35] fluence nothing that's not anything to
[8:38] say how'd you say what the prophets say
[8:40] it well it's like I told one brother I
[8:44] said you want to say what the Prophet
[8:46] said say what the Prophet said I said
[8:49] okay here's a direct quote Luther
[8:51] denominated and died went to hell see
[8:54] you want that quote
[9:00] do you want to quote you you won't give
[9:03] me a quote no you can quote yourself to
[9:05] dinner but now we know Luther never died
[9:09] Luthor never denominated he died
[9:14] physically but he didn't die spiritually
[9:17] see it's before and after I've explained
[9:21] it to you over and over but the outlier
[9:23] to people listening when he says the
[9:26] word boards that it's got so many
[9:28] different meanings to it
[9:29] yeah but the before and after explains
[9:31] it because I can say come on board and
[9:35] stand on this board because I'm bored
[9:38] with you well I've just explained all
[9:40] three times you know exactly what I'm
[9:44] talking about
[9:45] all right see then that a way the Bible
[9:48] is that way if we listened to what it's
[9:52] saying all right so now John says he
[9:57] says to John you know
[10:02] John introduces we're gonna go to that
[10:04] so go ahead and pull up on revelations
[10:07] one we'll go to verse four and start
[10:12] John when he speaks he's introducing
[10:20] this one and he finalizes it for the
[10:28] life part of saying I am Alpha and Omega
[10:34] now who is this that's speaking to John
[10:38] on Patmos so you can ice like I said you
[10:42] can spend all you time we run yourself
[10:43] crazy about trying to figure out this
[10:46] angel of that angel or who is this or
[10:48] who was that if where it was that what
[10:50] it appeared I'll go ahead and say this
[10:55] to you so you can think about it and
[10:57] you'll know that it's not gonna it won't
[10:59] run around with us but the angel that's
[11:02] mentioned in verse 2 and signified it by
[11:05] his angel I invite you to show me where
[11:10] that angel comes into being at because
[11:16] he's not mentioned
[11:19] as that away until the 19th chapter
[11:28] no no it's over here
[11:31] see we got a long ways to go but we're
[11:33] not interested in this out of the other
[11:35] I'm not trying to prove a point or show
[11:37] point it's like I say hey I just make it
[11:40] straight you want to put up for
[11:41] Christmas tree put up a Christmas tree
[11:43] that's as straight as I can be I'm not
[11:47] gonna condemn you for putting up on but
[11:49] now I don't want to hear you condemning
[11:51] somebody else vice versa either way see
[11:55] just stay where we are
[11:56] let's stay with the word that away all
[11:59] right and we'll come out to the end with
[12:00] the right understanding okay so look
[12:03] what he said isn't it before I tell you
[12:07] anything I want you to know who I am I
[12:10] like that I am don't you
[12:14] you know Jesus said before Abraham was I
[12:18] am
[12:22] Moses's to burning bullish I'm not going
[12:24] to you tell me something personal he
[12:27] said okay tell him I am that I am right
[12:32] Moses went with that when he got down
[12:35] there he said by rolling in said well
[12:38] well who sent you down here he said I am
[12:41] who's going to deliver the children that
[12:43] I am you get that personal to doing with
[12:47] him in his ministry yeah but he ain't
[12:50] the I am he ain't the one in the burning
[12:54] bush that was Christ so remember that
[12:58] now when we get down to the point in a
[13:00] minute and then we'll try to just hurry
[13:02] it up well look John to the seven
[13:04] churches which are in Asia grace be unto
[13:08] you and peace now watch from him now
[13:15] he's directed he's coming down to tell
[13:17] you something John is gonna tell it to
[13:20] you and who's it from from him which he
[13:22] is and which was and which is to come
[13:26] and from the seven spirits which are
[13:29] before his strong I know he is which was
[13:35] which is to come we know that as who
[13:39] Almighty God not a second person not a
[13:43] third person and he's not in really even
[13:46] dealing as a prophetic realm there he's
[13:49] expressing his deity
[13:50] okay listen and from Jesus Christ
[13:57] good enough to be coming up here but now
[13:59] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[14:02] faithful witness and the first begotten
[14:04] of the Dead and the Prince of the kings
[14:06] of the earth unto him that loved us and
[14:08] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[14:11] what's he doing who is this speaking who
[14:15] is this that John is bringing the
[14:17] message we'll get to it and read it
[14:22] where brother Branham says is referring
[14:24] to this that this is the only book in
[14:26] the Bible where as Jesus Christ
[14:28] appearing personally to ascribe to right
[14:32] now the scribe was John we know that all
[14:36] right but now listen to him washed us
[14:40] from our sins it goes all the way to
[14:43] showing who he is all the way through
[14:46] the church ages with this statement and
[14:52] have made us kings and priests unto God
[14:56] and his father to him be glory and
[14:59] Dominion for ever and ever amen
[15:00] behold what's new behold he cometh with
[15:04] clouds whoo who's coming with clouds the
[15:09] one Lord Jesus Christ right it's coming
[15:14] with clouds and every eye shall see him
[15:17] and they also which pierced him and all
[15:21] Kindred's of the earth shall wail
[15:22] because of him
[15:23] even so he says amen now once who's
[15:27] doing the speaking now I am Alpha and
[15:30] Omega the beginning and the ending saith
[15:34] the LORD which is which was and which is
[15:37] to come the Almighty alright so you see
[15:41] what I was laying out there Wednesday
[15:43] night from what the Prophet said before
[15:47] I tell you anything about it right about
[15:49] these we were doing that I want you to
[15:52] know who I am so now he puts his stamp
[15:55] of approval as he starts off saying this
[16:00] was the one that which was which is
[16:02] which has so come he winds it up by
[16:04] saying
[16:05] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning in
[16:09] the end he which was which is and shall
[16:12] come the Lord Jesus Christ all right so
[16:17] where do we put all the honor and the
[16:19] glory to the Lord Jesus Christ all right
[16:24] who is appearing to John to rock the
[16:27] Lord Jesus Christ yeah but wait don't
[16:32] you worry about it if I can get to the
[16:34] end of this like it is
[16:36] you should rejoice over what is hurt
[16:40] instead of having your feelings hurt
[16:44] just wait just gotta bear with me for a
[16:46] few services until we get a little
[16:49] background cuz you say well just tell us
[16:53] what you thinking I'll tell you what I'm
[16:55] thinking and you don't have nowhere in a
[16:57] world an idea of what I'm thinking see
[17:02] but if you listen you might come out to
[17:05] the right order alright now who is this
[17:08] and if you've got a red letter Bible you
[17:10] know it's written in letter red letter
[17:12] saying I am Alpha and Omega the
[17:16] beginning and the ended all right John
[17:21] before you tell them anything I want you
[17:24] to know who I am said now is that
[17:26] settled you realize by making that
[17:30] statement I looked it up and I know it
[17:33] doesn't refer to every time but I forgot
[17:35] how many six or seven hundred times it
[17:38] says in the Bible I am that all of don't
[17:41] refer to Jesus or anything like that we
[17:44] know that but just remember Jesus in
[17:49] Chapter eight 58 verily verily I say
[17:53] unto you
[17:56] before Abraham was I am
[17:59] I Exodus Moses at the burning bush said
[18:05] I am that I am now when the Bible speaks
[18:11] of it when it says burly burly or
[18:13] anytime it double states itself or its
[18:15] twice written about anything this dark
[18:18] remember its emphasizing the importance
[18:21] of listening to that point all right so
[18:24] when it says verily verily I say unto
[18:26] you all right that means not just listen
[18:29] that means lay down everything you've
[18:32] got and listen to what I'm saying
[18:37] because I'm going to bring forth
[18:39] something that's very interesting
[18:40] so when G when Jesus speaking to Moses
[18:44] from the burning bush that's what's your
[18:45] prophet said he was because he's the I
[18:48] am over here then he got to be the I on
[18:51] back tyre or you got an eye on back dar
[18:53] that means one thing I am over here that
[18:55] means something now that ain't right
[18:57] you're not going with Hebrews 13:8 okay
[19:01] you see why when he said that they said
[19:06] you're a man over 50
[19:11] and said you say you you see
[19:13] neighborhood he said before Abraham was
[19:18] I am
[19:23] yeah
[19:25] when he spoke to Moses at the burning
[19:28] bush he said I am because he wanted no
[19:34] name read your Bible to listen he said
[19:38] I'm the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[19:39] her Joseph one of the two every witch
[19:41] wish that sit there and he said in other
[19:46] words plain language we just read in
[19:48] your Bible Moses said I know who Abraham
[19:50] here I know who God is I know who Joseph
[19:53] is I know who the God of all these are
[19:56] and I believe it what's that ain't going
[20:00] you saw that don't say that well tell me
[20:03] what it says he said I ain't going like
[20:06] that
[20:07] give me something personal and I got a
[20:12] quote in here when brother Ron said
[20:13] that's where Moses failed
[20:17] he's what worried failed was he said he
[20:20] was anointed for the job with City he
[20:24] got a head - what'd he do he got a
[20:27] stinking dead Egyptian now if he'd
[20:31] waited on God now it's gonna be amazing
[20:33] when we get to reading that because in
[20:35] that reference he's talking about that
[20:39] Jesus said I do nothing until the father
[20:42] shows me why because it was the father
[20:48] showing him
[20:51] well now here we are Connor don't we get
[20:54] we get into these things and we get so
[20:56] carnal I'd like to get this carnal with
[20:58] you I guess God had to go over shake
[21:01] Jesus okay get up you got to go you got
[21:03] to go shave you got to go take a bath
[21:05] you got to go eat I said what are you
[21:08] talking about I'm talking about your
[21:09] stupid me to you there's that clear
[21:11] enough talking about your stupidity to
[21:14] think the way you think in your mind
[21:17] when Jesus said I'd do nothing till the
[21:19] father shows me what does that mean he
[21:24] didn't do nothing to kill God told you
[21:26] no what about you you know it's amazing
[21:31] in the human elements trying to explain
[21:33] our Wednesday night you realize that
[21:34] that being that you are inside of our
[21:37] keeps running when you're asleep
[21:39] you know it's amazing that that thing
[21:41] can keep working and you in a total
[21:43] unconscious state and your heart still
[21:48] beats right see let's don't be that away
[21:53] that's me let's listen to try to
[21:55] understand alright so who is this
[22:01] talking it's that I am
[22:06] and he puts it to word the emphasis
[22:09] would be there to not leave it just to
[22:11] say I am he said I am alpha just not at
[22:18] I am
[22:19] I'm alpha I'm the beginning and I will
[22:24] Megha
[22:24] I'm the ending he's playing the emphasis
[22:29] down to show one true and living God and
[22:35] who this was that was standing before
[22:38] John
[22:43] the same I am that appeared in the
[22:46] burning bush to Moses the same I am that
[22:49] walked on the shores of Galilee the same
[22:53] on him
[22:55] here he appears to ascribe and tells him
[23:02] what to rock
[23:06] now we won't get to it today cuz we
[23:08] don't have enough time on the end in
[23:09] just a few minutes on the thought but
[23:11] we'll get to it as we proceed along in
[23:15] our thoughts that the more and more that
[23:19] the Bible unfolds the more and more you
[23:21] ought to see Jesus Christ right the
[23:27] whole emphasis then is put back on who
[23:29] he is all right so before you get
[23:34] anything about all of this I want you to
[23:36] know who I am now listen this is what
[23:38] I'm going to say and this is the way I
[23:40] mean it where the problem with trying to
[23:43] understand the Book of Revelations of
[23:46] mankind I'm saying mankind which is
[23:49] denominationalism and all and coming all
[23:51] the way down to the people of the
[23:53] message I miss its way I think so that's
[23:55] what say it the problem is trying to
[23:59] understand the Bible from a bunch of
[24:03] quotes our thoughts and ideas that we
[24:06] have instead of the approach that God
[24:09] has for our understanding
[24:14] are you following me all right what is
[24:17] the approach
[24:21] this is the one that was speaking to
[24:23] Moses from the burning bush this is the
[24:27] one that walked ashore to Galilee this
[24:30] is the Alpha and the Omega I like it
[24:35] this way
[24:35] you know people say well he was Alpha
[24:37] and Omega and they'll say nothing in
[24:40] between oh boy they just used to quote
[24:42] that I'm Alpha and Omega and nothing in
[24:44] between let's direct quote but this
[24:47] brother branham meaning there's an Alpha
[24:48] and Omega and nothing in between or
[24:50] what's he trying to express he's
[24:54] expressing you one simple point he's
[24:56] Alpha and Omega nothing in between there
[24:58] is nothing between Alpha and Omega Alpha
[25:03] is Omega Omega is alpha all right now
[25:08] there's another quote where brother
[25:09] Brown said and he's everything between
[25:12] all right now are you gonna fight them
[25:15] without quotes so you're gonna fight
[25:18] your quote with a quote now instead of
[25:21] this being simple there's nothing
[25:24] between the Alpha and Omega because he's
[25:26] not a manifesting any form in between it
[25:32] but he's the Alpha in the church ages
[25:34] he's the Omega in the church age which
[25:36] means he's the same in each age I like
[25:41] the way the Book of Revelations is
[25:43] written to me it's so marvelous when
[25:47] used to read a simple little scripture
[25:49] and mankind has tried to figure out all
[25:51] of those things but to read or we will
[25:55] to when we get all over the next mason
[25:58] yourself that he's in the midst of the
[26:01] seven golden candlesticks
[26:05] now let's just be his carnal if we'd be
[26:07] I like to do that but make you think
[26:14] we say oh he was back here in the first
[26:18] we think we have the Alpha and Omega
[26:21] down said he was back here in the first
[26:23] and he's over here in the lice now I
[26:25] know what your profit is they will
[26:28] eventually get to those times sure he
[26:30] was a great manifestation back dire and
[26:33] then that died and went down to the
[26:35] ground and comes out over here to the
[26:37] manifestation again that's Alpha and
[26:38] Omega but just related to church hedges
[26:41] he didn't we say well now he was back
[26:43] here but he wasn't over here that
[26:46] Lutheran Westland Pentecost was false
[26:50] and you drop dead if I told you who said
[26:52] that huh what'd you see
[27:01] he's in the midst that's what I like
[27:06] which means without trying to understand
[27:10] it or interpreting it because you go one
[27:12] way you're going wrong we go the other
[27:14] way you're going on what does it mean to
[27:15] be in the midst of the seven golden
[27:16] candle stick he's just as happy in one
[27:19] ages is the other he was just as happy
[27:23] to be in Luther and West this day as a
[27:25] matter of fact you say he was more happy
[27:30] because those people stayed with what
[27:33] they could believe and served him under
[27:37] all that they were doing all of Dark
[27:39] Ages and the death coming forth the
[27:41] killing of them you know 68 million of
[27:44] them and all of that
[27:48] he said the minister the selling of
[27:50] again he's just as much in the first
[27:52] church a disease in the life when he's
[27:54] just as Mitch in the middle church
[27:55] agency isn't any Church age that's how
[27:59] simple I think people call me Saudi
[28:01] that's how simple I think see because
[28:07] you say oh no he was more over here than
[28:09] he is over here I know what you're
[28:11] talking about if you put it in the right
[28:12] order but if you don't put it in the
[28:14] right order you got any more yearning it
[28:15] away now where's a Hebrew Thursday night
[28:22] right you see Church we don't do we
[28:25] understand that's my point of what I was
[28:27] saying a moment ago if we just
[28:30] understood the Godhead we wouldn't be so
[28:35] confused about all the other things was
[28:40] that what the Prophet started off with
[28:42] saying the patent was vision that it's
[28:46] the revelation of the supreme deity of
[28:48] Jesus Christ
[28:56] see then who is he talking about here
[28:58] who is this one this says I'm Alpha and
[29:03] Omega the Lord Jesus Christ no okay
[29:13] you said what I just don't understand
[29:15] but Iran said that even the Apostles
[29:18] didn't understand he said they had
[29:20] troubled will read it then he said they
[29:22] had troubled he said they couldn't
[29:24] understand him he said the reason they
[29:28] had troubles he said because sometimes
[29:34] the father was speaking and sometimes
[29:37] her son was speaking
[29:40] well that's - you got this one up here
[29:43] coming down and divorce from over here
[29:45] saying behold you know so you know all
[29:47] them feelings in their mind
[29:54] but I think sensible
[29:59] uh-huh we'll get to it in just a second
[30:02] who do you pray to
[30:04] where's he at
[30:11] but let's get it right this way
[30:17] who is he
[30:21] he said I'm the Alpha and Omega
[30:25] I'm the beginning and I'm the end it
[30:28] besides me there's not anything else
[30:32] right nothing else in between it's just
[30:37] the Lord all right now
[30:42] then when he appears to John
[30:48] he declares to John who he is
[30:54] uh-huh let's just go ahead and get that
[30:56] part let's pick it up see we're not
[30:59] talking about two persons or one person
[31:03] trying to speak to another person let me
[31:05] ask you the question who do you pray to
[31:14] now would you admit that the biggest
[31:16] portion of your prayers
[31:20] is not audible words
[31:26] brah is that ruler
[31:30] the biggest portion of your priors
[31:31] because the Bible says to Prairie
[31:33] without ceasing well we ought to be
[31:35] praying all day long you know and it's
[31:36] easy to pray if you know how it is you
[31:39] know why I don't understand how all this
[31:41] telephone system works how that they got
[31:44] this one wire that runs from here to
[31:45] California and now they don't even have
[31:47] that they got all these mono filaments
[31:49] and all the stuff that there and
[31:50] thousands of voices is going through one
[31:53] little old system but it works well you
[31:58] know what my point is you know what he
[32:01] can keep up with all of the prior
[32:03] requests that's turned into him right
[32:06] he's never busy you never get a busy
[32:09] signal when you talk try to talk to it
[32:12] he's always there to listen but do you
[32:16] speak you've got him inside of you do
[32:21] you speak to he that is within you
[32:28] how do you speak to the one that's up in
[32:30] heaven
[32:33] no no brother Dale we're supposed to
[32:36] pray our Father which art in heaven
[32:38] where's heaven
[32:44] I thought heaven was wherever God was
[32:46] that where's God at living within you
[32:49] right he's Christ in you the hope of
[32:53] glory all right think about it then who
[32:58] do you pray to
[33:04] most of our priors is just thoughts in
[33:07] her mind write what you know in that
[33:11] same mind there's also all kind of
[33:16] thoughts of Satan and all kind of
[33:18] perverted things you know and how the
[33:21] Lord you know divides between all of
[33:23] that I don't know that's that's all
[33:26] right he just said God man had broke
[33:28] into God and laboratory they broke into
[33:32] work the things that God could do before
[33:35] bread run said TV was back in the garden
[33:37] he said we just never come together
[33:39] until now all right
[33:41] see we look at TV back in the garden
[33:43] there was a tubes and blood tube you can
[33:45] be sued over those of your younger kids
[33:49] don't remember all the old thing he had
[33:51] a little ol bitty screen about this big
[33:53] you didn't have a full-length screen you
[33:57] had a little screen about this big on
[33:59] the first TV and you know how big the TV
[34:03] whoa
[34:10] I mean it was at least 36 inches high I
[34:15] know and you have tubes in there that's
[34:18] bigger than our TVs today he's got them
[34:20] all to working mechanism but do you get
[34:23] what I'm saying man has broke into her
[34:27] god damn little random said our thoughts
[34:31] in heaven were louder than our words on
[34:34] earth it would be careful what we think
[34:38] right Lord ask God to clean that slate
[34:43] you know I don't know what they do in
[34:46] all this stuff today but the old
[34:48] recorders you know you had a thing you
[34:49] could just take a cassette or a
[34:51] Seventeen's real and you can just drag
[34:53] this thing across he didn't just
[34:55] demagnetize aren't you gonna call it and
[34:57] all of those things that go off of it
[34:59] then you go back and reuse it yeah I
[35:02] sure hope God does that with all my
[35:04] thinking but you know every once in a
[35:07] while he does get into you thinking
[35:10] right he does every once in a while this
[35:14] is my whole point we'll finish there we
[35:16] don't get nothing else it's all right
[35:17] the whole point he he can get through
[35:20] all of that and talk to you tell you
[35:25] things that the prophets desired to look
[35:30] into Sara he can tell it to you
[35:40] because he can speak to you in your
[35:43] inner being and you can speak out of
[35:45] your inner being back to him don't think
[35:50] like that
[35:56] they're wooden the Prophet brought her
[35:57] What did he say this lady was talking
[36:00] about you know he's up here son over her
[36:01] speaking of where and he said let me
[36:03] just ask you one question said when you
[36:05] pray and said who you talking to
[36:08] well I'm talking to God up in heaven is
[36:14] he up in heaven
[36:16] I thought he was in you right I thought
[36:21] he lived in you by the baptism of the
[36:23] Holy Ghost
[36:24] I thought the Prophet said he wants to
[36:28] do his thinking through us he's talking
[36:33] through us so what is it I'm just trying
[36:40] to be sensible to where you'll think
[36:42] about what it means when he says I want
[36:45] you to know who I am I'm trying to get
[36:48] you to see who he is right here today in
[36:51] your own thinking well some of you are
[36:55] sitting there saying are we seed hurry
[36:57] up some of your saying I wonder if that
[37:02] food downstairs is burning did I get the
[37:05] biscuits cooked right Oh
[37:11] what in the world is this guy talking
[37:13] about we're spending all this time
[37:18] I'm trying to express a point
[37:23] that Jesus that I do nothing until the
[37:27] father shows me
[37:32] that the Prophet said it was time that
[37:33] the father was speaking there was times
[37:36] the son was speaking larra I don't
[37:39] understand
[37:40] you got to hold a ghost inside of you
[37:44] he's at him talking all the time no no
[37:48] no that ain't it
[37:50] it ain't him I wish it was but it ain't
[37:54] him there's another guy does most of the
[37:57] talking in me I'm honest
[38:02] that's why I still like that partner we
[38:04] have an advocate but let me repent and
[38:08] get rid of all the things I don't have
[38:09] to answer down at the rivers we call it
[38:13] what think about it children think about
[38:16] it you realize God can speak to you in
[38:21] your inner being
[38:25] and communicate with you
[38:32] and your priors don't have to be audible
[38:35] but it's nothing wrong with them being
[38:37] audible but you know what I think about
[38:40] when I think about people in their their
[38:42] ways of doing it like audible to this I
[38:43] don't don't do it so much today because
[38:47] I don't have them but I don't mean this
[38:49] wrong I wasn't being truthful you know
[38:51] we always we go hunting we go places and
[38:54] I you know we've had them to console the
[38:58] whole thing of the morning to get us to
[39:00] pray and say come on wait or Sam y'all
[39:04] pray over the food we'll see we don't
[39:09] might know I'm a preacher we're gonna
[39:14] pray for we go let's get y'all getting
[39:18] out here and pray you said well that's
[39:20] what brought around with it yeah Kyle
[39:21] rode around the tunnel brother went
[39:24] hunting sinners so what we do what's
[39:28] their own problem a lot of times we
[39:32] around the table we'll say us quiet
[39:34] prayer take our hats off and pray
[39:36] sometimes we just take our hats off in
[39:38] there hey I know all the quotes - I
[39:41] never be like well I'll come in and he
[39:45] was late getting there this is the story
[39:47] he told and they had done parade and
[39:50] they were getting Billy Paul sat down
[39:53] pat him and he said brother Brown said
[39:57] did God hear you Billy so I didn't hear
[39:59] you well he was making a point yeah but
[40:06] we just say our priors we don't force
[40:09] nothing over on them because there's no
[40:11] need of it cuz they don't care what you
[40:13] doing but we do our own thing well why
[40:19] can't we do that whatever thing just
[40:21] this be ourselves and do it
[40:24] you can talk to God all day long
[40:30] you were saying
[40:33] right you ever just seen you're just
[40:36] saying out loud but you ever just sing
[40:39] to yourself you know I mean my voice is
[40:45] crazy but I'll says I'm somewhere
[40:47] between a joyful noise in an awful
[40:49] racket well that's a pretty good place
[40:51] to put my own color don't know but you
[40:53] know what
[40:53] inside of me I got the prettiest voice
[40:55] if they were heard in life I get so
[41:01] tickled you know brother Adam is the
[41:06] world's worse to start a song off but
[41:09] the best there is in the world to get to
[41:12] where after he starts one word gets a
[41:14] second word right and take off with it
[41:16] you pay attention he'd have that first
[41:20] word wrong but the second word he's
[41:22] right on key
[41:27] and see you musicians tell me first word
[41:30] of a song is what the highest note or
[41:33] ever what you call it
[41:34] that first one peaches for the whole
[41:36] song well that's the way most of us are
[41:38] we're flat to start with well you say
[41:43] what do you talking about
[41:43] I'm talking about don't you sing don't
[41:48] you sayin I mean I'll be going along
[41:51] sometimes I'll they say jesus loves me
[41:53] this I know for the Bible tells me so
[42:04] you know I can communicate with him I
[42:08] can sing about it
[42:15] you see the way that I pray I always
[42:18] pray my father
[42:24] see the reason it is that my father died
[42:26] in house four years old I never knew
[42:27] much about having a father I had to have
[42:29] a brother as a father figure and I
[42:32] appreciate it all now but he's my father
[42:40] you know what I just talked to him
[42:44] so fonder I love you
[42:48] love you Father thank you
[42:52] the father I know you don't understand
[42:54] those human elements you came down and
[42:58] lived a while with us to learn all about
[43:00] the things but you ever reminded him hey
[43:05] I'm getting old or you didn't get old
[43:07] I've heard a lot of things good like
[43:09] that's okay
[43:10] you know women say well there's one
[43:11] thing about it he never had a baby he
[43:13] don't know what it is to have a baby
[43:14] no but he knew the worse and worse of
[43:16] all of that you know it worse a lot
[43:18] worse or thing that's not throwing off
[43:20] on nobody
[43:21] it's just truthful before you understand
[43:26] anything about this book of revelations
[43:28] I want you to understand who I am who
[43:34] had come from and what happened is
[43:36] another situation
[43:44] let me ask you a simple question because
[43:47] it'll come out later
[43:51] does the word come to the profit
[43:55] is that true
[43:57] well did the Book of Revelations come to
[43:59] brother branham or did the entire Bible
[44:01] come to
[44:09] Oh what it's just it's just a book a
[44:12] revelation come to prop well then who
[44:14] was the rest of it
[44:17] you see we've got some wonderful things
[44:19] to think about if we'll just be simple
[44:22] than our thinking
[44:25] the Prophet said who do you pray to
[44:33] I pray to the Father watch good
[44:37] that's what he's dad
[44:41] but why did Jesus come and say
[44:46] now what is the name of your God
[44:52] my God's name is God not here you're
[44:55] being silly
[44:56] what is the name of God Jesus was the
[45:00] only name God ever had I'm quoting
[45:02] brother Branham okay but one of Jesus
[45:08] come along instead ask anything in my
[45:10] name the father didn't say ask anything
[45:15] in my night
[45:19] but the man Jesus said ask anything in
[45:22] my name and the father will do that you
[45:27] know while we don't get our prayers
[45:28] answered
[45:29] but around says you can call him Jesus
[45:32] Jesus and not get nothing but inside of
[45:38] you and you're thinking when you're
[45:39] thinking about who you're talking to and
[45:45] know that Jesus is the Christ
[45:54] so who do you pray to
[45:58] well I see you changed it now and get it
[46:01] okay bro okay brother there we got it
[46:02] now
[46:02] I pray to the ones inside of me we that
[46:07] doesn't work either cousin they asked
[46:09] you to answer the blessing you pray out
[46:10] loud right and there's nothing wrong
[46:15] with praying out loud but like I said
[46:20] you know we get it to the point we want
[46:21] to pray out loud to where everybody in
[46:23] the building can hear us especially in
[46:26] the old days when you had to smoking all
[46:28] over the place and that was one it
[46:30] always tickled me
[46:31] you know we'd walk in and say well okay
[46:38] you're coming in the door how are the
[46:42] non-smoking
[46:44] when they're behind the building no he
[46:46] wanted non-smoking what good was that
[46:49] now tell me it didn't happen come on
[46:55] and sometimes it was you happening with
[46:57] it come on let's hurt your feelings you
[47:01] gotta get right no you don't have to get
[47:02] behind God's not hard of here he's not
[47:08] death
[47:12] but he does like to hear you voice you
[47:15] know
[47:18] you're saying and what are you doing
[47:19] seeing him now if you sing in the world
[47:22] songs
[47:22] who's the one you're singing to right
[47:27] but if you're singing the songs of Zion
[47:30] who are you singing to God loves good
[47:34] music
[47:38] but the random was listen last night and
[47:40] run around city to know someone he said
[47:42] whatever you do put everything you got
[47:44] into it he says because they ain't no
[47:47] need of doing if you don't put
[47:48] everything all right what are you
[47:51] talking about what's the problem the
[47:53] purpose we believe in one God do
[48:02] do we believe it correctly
[48:07] well now let me make one more statement
[48:11] we pray to the garnish within us
[48:17] we talked to him all day long but you
[48:20] know what he's my god I don't pray to
[48:24] the God in you does he see I don't know
[48:28] who's it
[48:33] I might be calling him Jesus Jesus
[48:35] they're not getting nothing I don't pray
[48:39] to the one in you I pray to the one in
[48:41] me could I know where he's at
[48:48] what are you saying he's not even me
[48:49] that's between you and God that ain't
[48:51] none of my business my relations between
[48:55] you and God not between me and you and
[48:56] God do you get the point
[49:00] we spent Wednesday night talking about
[49:03] trying to get down to the thought of one
[49:04] God because he says before you I tell
[49:09] you anything I want you to know who I am
[49:13] then immediately now we go verse 4
[49:16] through 8 to see who this is this is the
[49:23] Lord Jesus Christ appearing personally -
[49:28] John - right
[49:36] so you think I'm doing away with nine
[49:39] just wait
[49:43] gotta get the story right we might
[49:46] understand who was who and what's going
[49:50] on but he spends his time there saying
[49:53] I'm the I'm the one that he was which
[49:55] used to come
[49:56] that's the Lord Jesus Christ then he
[49:59] finishes it up by saying that that I'm
[50:02] Alpha and Omega B that was which he is
[50:06] and shall come how many gods do you have
[50:09] there's just one true and living God in
[50:12] the Bible there's not a Trinity than the
[50:18] Word of God that's what's talked to us
[50:20] by mankind with his reasoning abilities
[50:23] who was it up in the sky that was
[50:25] speaking up there and said Jesus down
[50:27] here and the Holy Ghost over here and
[50:30] gotta be two or three of them there's
[50:34] many manifestations of God but there's
[50:37] only one true and living God and his
[50:39] name is Jesus
[50:43] that's why Peter and him knew what he
[50:46] was saying
[50:48] when he told him to go baptize in the
[50:50] name of the Father and of the Son and
[50:52] the Holy Ghost they knew who he was
[50:56] talking about that he had no doubts of a
[51:00] Trinitarian concept and really to show
[51:03] you the natural story the Trinity had
[51:06] not been conceived into the mind of
[51:08] mankind it comes on over about 325 AD I
[51:13] like that before it really comes into
[51:15] realities of kind of come forth with a
[51:17] Trinitarian concept the Jews never
[51:22] believed in nothing but one God
[51:29] they had no concept of a Trinity back in
[51:32] the writings of Matthew Mark Luke and
[51:33] John read it or even in the writing of
[51:36] the early apostles
[51:43] but a simple phone who do you pray to
[51:49] I pray to my father
[51:55] well I pray to Jesus now what are you
[51:57] trying to prove
[52:01] you know well what are you trying to
[52:03] prove I'm trying to prove Bible drive I
[52:05] pray to my father
[52:07] that's what the Bible says ask how to
[52:12] pray that's not the Lord's Prayer you
[52:17] know he asked how to pray pray our
[52:21] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[52:23] thy name
[52:24] God's prayer is over in Saint John 17
[52:26] where he said sanctify them through thy
[52:28] truth thy Word is truth
[52:29] that's the Lord
[52:34] you see Church
[52:37] we've proved a lot of times our thoughts
[52:41] because we won't listen to further
[52:43] advancements and we say we've got it
[52:45] figured out well
[52:51] if we gotta figure out right I'm quoting
[52:53] the Prophet this is what he said I read
[52:55] him other day he said we got it Ron said
[52:57] we got rod that's good but he said if we
[52:59] ain't got it right you got a problem no
[53:03] but now do you understand what I'm
[53:06] trying to say that your prophet said
[53:11] that Jesus and God was the self same
[53:14] person now Jesus is the flesh amen I'm
[53:19] glad you saw that
[53:25] but when if Jesus is the fleshed in the
[53:28] name of the flesh is Jesus what was his
[53:30] father's name
[53:36] he's gonna come my father's nothing what
[53:39] was the father's name the father's name
[53:43] had to be Jesus
[53:47] no oh it was Joe come on we've been in
[53:51] the message long enough his name of the
[53:53] Old Testament wouldn't Jehovah you want
[53:54] to scripture for that he said by my name
[53:57] is Jehovah what I never known that's
[53:59] Bible you will find it and let you read
[54:01] it read that true Jehovah Witness
[54:05] sometimes when they're trying to tell
[54:06] you that his name was Jehovah say what
[54:08] it says here he said by my name Jose I
[54:10] never known Jehovah is a title to a name
[54:16] his name was Jesus but see it wasn't
[54:20] pronounced not it not if they never said
[54:24] Jes us Jesus because it was a lot of
[54:27] Jesus's back there but there was never a
[54:31] reference to whom God is and knowing his
[54:34] name and knowing that name is Jesus
[54:41] his name is Jesus that's why you baptize
[54:43] name of Lord Jesus Christ that's why
[54:46] you're to pray in the name of Jesus
[54:47] because he told us that but one day
[54:50] it'll don't tell you what you're doing
[55:00] he said ask anything is my name well
[55:04] father I want to ask you in the name of
[55:06] the son his name was Jesus
[55:14] see that's where we got it all figured
[55:16] out
[55:19] but then we go this ballistics when
[55:22] anybody says something different but I
[55:25] run said that those that was a dual
[55:27] person
[55:30] father and son was a dual person
[55:36] in here
[55:40] do a person
[55:47] I'll find it a minute and look through
[55:51] a dual person
[55:55] dual means to win a morning we got it
[55:58] now
[56:04] come on look at it Manoj yeah
[56:11] number three Jehovah Jireh 1956 that's
[56:17] the reason people couldn't understand
[56:20] him
[56:21] sometimes it was Christ speaking or was
[56:25] the son speaking other times it was the
[56:28] father speaking he was a dual person
[56:33] they're not two persons a dual person
[56:38] one that's why people don't understand
[56:41] because Jesus was God made manifest in
[56:45] human flesh if you just get that part as
[56:50] I was trying to bring out Wednesday
[56:51] night we're a human being right we're
[56:55] body the spirit or soul God came down to
[56:59] dwell with mankind body spirit so body
[57:05] was a creation by the Word of God spoken
[57:08] into existence
[57:11] the body was not eternal it had to be
[57:15] made eternal in the resurrection and
[57:17] change the body wasn't eternal so the
[57:22] body was a human flesh
[57:26] but in that body dwelt Almighty God
[57:33] body spirit and soul body he was a man
[57:37] I'm quoting brother Branham I gave him
[57:39] to you ins de nada be glad to read him
[57:41] he said benign soul he was almighty God
[57:47] he said body he was a man but said in
[57:49] spirit he was Almighty God
[57:54] but you see I'm trying to express a
[57:56] human part of us and I'll I'll get this
[57:59] wording and we'll quit that
[58:04] the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness
[58:06] of the Godhead bodily well in that flesh
[58:09] man dwelt the soul and the spirit of
[58:13] Almighty God because he was Almighty God
[58:17] now if the soul somewheres else in the
[58:20] spirit was somewheres else then he
[58:21] wasn't complete right he wasn't a being
[58:27] without having body spirit and soul to
[58:30] make him a being a person yeah but
[58:36] brother dad you just make God to to you
[58:39] try to make him to real or something
[58:42] thank God I wish I could make him so
[58:45] real until you could see him when he
[58:51] said if you've seen me you've seen the
[58:52] father
[58:54] well now that was just a statement of
[58:56] well something like something no
[58:58] statement of something like son if he's
[59:03] not telling the truth are than he lied
[59:04] so where we at
[59:09] but do you understand take the thought
[59:12] with you as we end in this part of God
[59:18] was in Christ we'll get back to the
[59:20] scripture and it says in him dwelt the
[59:23] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[59:28] in him to all fullness dwell so he was
[59:34] either all God or he would his heaven
[59:41] but but you just said then he had a body
[59:43] dried he had to have a body to live in
[59:47] what do you think he would have lived
[59:49] how could he have come down and died for
[59:52] you and I melchester that couldn't do it
[59:57] he was a creation but he was Almighty
[59:59] God in human flesh but he couldn't die
[1:00:04] for our sins but when he come in human
[1:00:07] flesh to be a savior he had to come in
[1:00:14] flesh
[1:00:17] he said well brother Dale what are your
[1:00:18] God gonna look like when you get over
[1:00:20] they're gonna look just like he did when
[1:00:22] he was here and see that's why I like it
[1:00:26] so I like the message
[1:00:32] you see until the Lord appeared to
[1:00:34] brother branham up there in the field
[1:00:37] you know his idea or thoughts or what
[1:00:39] Jesus looked like would just been his
[1:00:42] thoughts right and there were many
[1:00:47] people drought all kind of pictures of
[1:00:48] Jesus before brother around him ever
[1:00:50] coming on but then God laid it on the
[1:00:53] heart of a man named Hoffman to paint a
[1:00:56] picture of the Lord Jesus now brett
[1:01:01] Ryland didn't say that's where we
[1:01:02] misquote him he didn't say that Jesus
[1:01:04] looked just like Hoffman
[1:01:05] he says the closest the closest
[1:01:13] we'll see I believe he saw Jesus don't
[1:01:15] you you know I
