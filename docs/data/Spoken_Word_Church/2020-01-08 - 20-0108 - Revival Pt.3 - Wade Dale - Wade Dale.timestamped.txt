[4:36] brother Dale having a heart to be able
[4:38] to let us to do these things let us do
[4:40] these things they man
[4:41] so it's Psalms 85 verse one and we'll
[4:44] review a little bit keep everybody a
[4:50] prayer we we haven't heard any more
[4:53] about brother John LaFontaine but he's
[4:55] he's had open-heart surgery and
[4:57] blockages and all that so he's had a had
[5:00] a rough times we'll keep him in your
[5:01] prayers
[5:01] so let's bow our heads the Heavenly
[5:03] Father we pray Lord tonight that you
[5:04] would speak to us Lord not by just being
[5:12] a God that stands alone somewhere but
[5:16] Lord you're your now you're with your
[5:18] people your people have gathered
[5:20] together to hear from you Lord not to
[5:22] hear from a man but to hear from you
[5:24] father and I pray that you would take
[5:26] the words that are being said you speak
[5:28] the words you'd be the one that does the
[5:31] speaking father and you're the only one
[5:32] that can do the revealing we can talk as
[5:34] much as we want to all night long but
[5:36] unless you come on the scene and reveal
[5:38] yourself to the people it will do us no
[5:41] good because Paul says the letter
[5:43] killeth but the Spirit added to that
[5:45] letter we'll give it life father we pray
[5:48] that you'd heal the sick Lord brother
[5:49] John and the different ones that we that
[5:52] were praying for their Lord we pray that
[5:53] you'd just be with each one that's sick
[5:55] even here in the building the ones that
[5:57] are getting older Lord that you pray
[5:59] that you'll just comfort them and
[6:00] they're in their troubles and heartaches
[6:03] and trials and you'll be with each one
[6:04] father bless the missionaries on the
[6:06] foreign fields Lord get my fruit for the
[6:08] labor father just forgive us of our sins
[6:10] Lord and show us our position and our
[6:13] here in the waning hours of of the time
[6:17] of this world that we're getting ready
[6:19] to leave and we know the world is going
[6:21] to go on but you said you were going to
[6:23] have a bride because you promised it in
[6:25] your word so there will be someone
[6:27] that'll stand in the end time and say
[6:29] death where is your sting grave where is
[6:33] your victory and we will not have to go
[6:35] to that dark place called the grave
[6:36] father we pray that you would just
[6:38] sanctify the people bless each one in
[6:40] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[6:43] Psalms 85 verse one to the chief
[6:46] musician a psalm of the son of Korah
[6:48] Lord thou has been favorable into the
[6:51] land and now it's brought back the
[6:52] captivity of Jacob thou has forgiven the
[6:55] iniquity of thy people now God's words
[6:57] got to come to pass thou has covered all
[7:00] their sins Selah thou has taken away all
[7:02] thy wrath thou has turned thyself from
[7:05] the fierceness of thine anger
[7:06] turn us O God of our salvation and
[7:09] caused on anger toward us to cease wilt
[7:12] thou be angry with us forever
[7:14] wilt thou draw out thine anger to all
[7:17] generations question mark wilt thou not
[7:21] revive us again that thy people may
[7:24] rejoice in the show us thy mercy O Lord
[7:27] in Brenna's da salvation 2nd chronicles
[7:30] 7 verse 14 will read this and be seated
[7:33] if my people which are called by my name
[7:37] shall humble themselves watch these
[7:40] watch these things right here humble
[7:43] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[7:47] turn from their wicked ways then will I
[7:52] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[7:54] sin and will heal their heal their land
[7:56] now mine eyes shall be open in my ears a
[7:59] tenth unto the prayer that is made in
[8:01] this place for now high have chosen and
[8:04] sanctified this house know what we were
[8:05] talking about this out not to brick and
[8:08] mortar this house that my name may and
[8:10] be in there forever in my eyes in my
[8:14] heart shall be there perpetually you may
[8:17] be seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[8:19] the reading of the word thank the Lord
[8:22] for all the good things we had during
[8:25] the holidays and thank goodness it so
[8:28] and we can get back to a little more
[8:30] normalcy and and be able to you know
[8:35] this is time of the year when everybody
[8:37] kind of stays home and don't do a lot of
[8:39] vacating and we can get a lot of get a
[8:41] lot of things done and and we thank God
[8:44] that he's give us another year and that
[8:48] we can look on the you know their safety
[8:52] in the Word of God and I was thinking
[8:57] yesterday that and forgive me for a
[9:02] minute but God knows who's gonna make it
[9:05] and who's not gonna make it we don't but
[9:10] if you'll ask God to give you a little
[9:12] insight because we're all living under a
[9:15] prophetic message coming from a prophet
[9:18] thats all things 60 and 70 in 80 years
[9:21] before they happened look at naman yeah
[9:25] he saw what chariots Jocelin in the
[9:28] streets four thousand years before there
[9:31] was ever one car built so God gives
[9:33] people insights sure God send prophets
[9:35] and he sent brother Branham but he
[9:37] didn't take that prophetic he took his
[9:39] prophetic gift of divine healing but not
[9:41] the prophetic gift of being prophetic
[9:43] people being able to see because brother
[9:46] Brown told us we were prophetic people
[9:48] we had prophetic insight so we could see
[9:51] these things and I was thinking the
[9:53] other day you know people say well I
[9:54] just don't know if I can make it well
[9:57] you know what God new year's gonna say
[9:58] that but I'm here to tell you quit
[10:01] saying that you say I'm gonna make it
[10:05] that's what the Word of God says the
[10:07] Word of God says we're going to make it
[10:09] somebody and that's why I was thinking
[10:10] the other day you know God there's an
[10:12] eternal strand that goes all the way
[10:14] from God all the way through I mean it
[10:16] doesn't end we must if we're attached to
[10:20] that what have we got to worry about if
[10:23] we attach ourselves to that he tell you
[10:25] say you you say no you're yeah we
[10:27] predestinate from the foundational world
[10:28] God knew exactly where we would be but
[10:31] you don't that's the free moral agent
[10:33] part of man that man can be a free moral
[10:36] agent and how much more do we praise God
[10:39] being a free moral agent instead of just
[10:41] going
[10:41] and being beat into it or being whipped
[10:43] into doing something amen so let's give
[10:46] ourselves all this year we're talking
[10:49] about a revival and we know that since
[10:51] we've been talking about it it's got to
[10:52] start with you I'm gonna read you
[10:54] another prayer that sister Esther is not
[10:56] here tonight but she had she's got her
[10:58] own a refrigerator sister Smallwood and
[11:01] she gave it to me and I'm gonna use it
[11:02] tonight I think we ought to all put it
[11:04] on our on our refrigerators because it
[11:07] becomes a revival we think well if
[11:11] brother Mark would just get in line
[11:14] we'll have a revival let maybe so but
[11:19] he's got to say that our problem is as
[11:23] we point our finger out there - well if
[11:25] brother Bob would quit doing let me let
[11:28] me read you this prayer in just a second
[11:30] I'll tell you what a prophet did a
[11:32] prayer for us but it was a prayer for
[11:36] itself all right let's go to the Hebrew
[11:39] lexicon and see what remember because
[11:41] revived is not resurrection resurrection
[11:44] is you are dead if you are not born
[11:48] again today you are dead you are dead
[11:51] but we want to be dead in Christ so the
[11:55] Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise
[11:56] first
[11:57] if you're dead in Christ today you are
[11:59] born again amen but this is a revival of
[12:03] what you already have I want us to go
[12:05] through and look at the things that you
[12:07] already have we ought to thank God for
[12:10] the things we already have and then not
[12:13] for what's coming we know what's coming
[12:16] according to the Bible but we don't know
[12:19] exactly what tomorrow is but we know the
[12:23] guy that holds tomorrow so revival then
[12:27] get away from revival being a
[12:29] resurrection resurrection is sure we
[12:32] want to get people saved we want to get
[12:34] them sanctified we want to get them fold
[12:35] with the Holy Ghost as we were talking
[12:37] in the youth Bible study or the Youth
[12:39] Bible study the question came up about
[12:41] communion communion is communing with
[12:44] God and it's a very intimate thing and
[12:48] if you don't take communion that tells
[12:51] you one or two things I was telling the
[12:53] kids it's that divining
[12:55] dividing time in that defining moment
[12:58] when somebody walks up in front of you
[13:00] and hence you the the bread and the wine
[13:02] and you don't partake of it there's a
[13:06] problem there
[13:07] all Christians take communion all right
[13:14] if you're born again you will take
[13:16] communion you say well I've got forget
[13:19] all that if you're born again find out
[13:22] first even if you have a problem brother
[13:26] Brown said take the communion but go
[13:29] make it right take the communion but
[13:31] don't make it right and if you're born
[13:33] again you will go make it right
[13:34] so see it all goes back to that and and
[13:37] I don't want it to be something to where
[13:39] it's a embarrassing moment but if you
[13:42] don't take communion then then it's just
[13:44] got to be this you're not born again the
[13:46] same way we're like what time I coming
[13:48] to church and doing all these things it
[13:50] just tells us it defines our life so now
[13:53] let's look at revival it says to live
[13:56] have life remain alive sustain life and
[14:01] what do we say a revival meant it meant
[14:04] water what is this that you know you can
[14:06] do without food
[14:07] some of us good for a while but we can't
[14:10] do without water you can't it's only
[14:13] like seven days you can do without
[14:14] something liquid but now you can do
[14:16] without food so we want to remain alive
[14:19] or Sisto which so we want this revival
[14:21] to be a sustaining revival we want it to
[14:23] be something that when you get up in the
[14:25] morning put your feet on the ground
[14:26] you've already been the victor so
[14:30] there's a lot of people didn't make it
[14:31] through that evening and here I'm coming
[14:33] close to 60 years old and I see that
[14:35] more than ever yet another man was
[14:37] talking today he looked at me and he
[14:39] said he's a lot of people not made it to
[14:41] 60 years old I said there's millions of
[14:44] people never made it to your age you are
[14:46] even you young kids there's millions of
[14:49] people never made it to your age why are
[14:50] you still here
[14:52] why's God still doing things why he's
[14:54] not finished with you when God's
[14:56] finished with you I want the book folded
[14:58] and I want to go the house but when he's
[15:00] dead he's not done with me yet so I'm
[15:02] just going to keep on going but and
[15:04] that's what just sustains us is that
[15:07] revival that we have in our
[15:09] life and I'll read you something a
[15:11] little bit later about brother Brown
[15:12] talks about things becoming common in
[15:15] becoming plain we don't want that to
[15:17] happen we want we want to have that
[15:18] little spark all the time all right to
[15:22] live to have life remain alive sustain
[15:24] life live prosperously now that doesn't
[15:26] always mean that we live in a 5,000
[15:29] square foot house no that doesn't mean
[15:31] that you can live a prosperous life and
[15:35] be a pauper look at Lazarus membered the
[15:40] one that was in the bosom of Abraham he
[15:42] was a pauper and the rich young ruler
[15:43] was the one that was in hell
[15:45] all right so live forever be quickened
[15:48] be alive be restored to life and health
[15:52] to continue in life and remain alive you
[15:54] say well that now that to me that
[15:56] doesn't mean normal natural life that
[16:00] means stay alive in God because I'm
[16:03] going to tell you something those that
[16:04] are in that six dimension now are more
[16:06] alive and God than me and you are amen
[16:08] so that we got to quit looking at that
[16:10] we're more alive because we're no that
[16:14] just means you can breathe that just
[16:16] means you still got part of your human
[16:18] faculty here
[16:19] they're over there breathing an eternal
[16:21] air amen but to get them here you and I
[16:25] are gonna have to be quickened to a
[16:26] point that's never been quickened before
[16:28] that's what we're gonna try to get to it
[16:31] and it's a requirement it's a
[16:34] requirement because we're going to look
[16:35] in a few minutes about the church ages
[16:38] there were requirements in each church
[16:40] age and we're going to look at them and
[16:41] we're going to see how their revival
[16:43] died because the revival died God sent
[16:48] somebody to revive what they had fallen
[16:52] from amen and listen when there's a
[16:56] rebuke in this Book of Revelations when
[16:58] there's a rebuke to these Church ages
[17:00] it's not a rebuke to the world
[17:03] it's a rebuke to the Christians that
[17:07] have fallen away as brother Dale's
[17:09] bringing out so graciously and wonderful
[17:11] about that seed that seed is the
[17:13] children of God children of the kingdom
[17:17] church his word of God we know that but
[17:19] why does he say he says well that's the
[17:20] children of the kingdom he's talking
[17:22] about me
[17:22] you that Satan took your joy away from
[17:28] you but he can't have it the joy of the
[17:34] Lord it's my strength amen I don't want
[17:38] him to have any joy I want him to be the
[17:40] most miserable person that ever lived
[17:41] the only problem is is we laid him in
[17:43] here and there both of you that way
[17:47] true but let him be miserable but I'm
[17:51] not going to be miserable alright so
[17:54] let's look at this the next one number
[17:55] one this is the first prayer oh wait a
[17:57] minute let's go to Hosea we got to go to
[17:59] the promised coming let us return into
[18:01] the Lord for he hath torn and he will
[18:02] heal us he has smitten and he will bind
[18:05] us up after two days will he revive us
[18:08] promise of God must come to pass
[18:12] God's Word has to come to pass
[18:15] it couldn't during those two days come
[18:18] as this is coming here he will revive us
[18:22] in the third day he will what raise us
[18:25] up and we shall live in his sight
[18:28] showing the resurrection in that third
[18:31] day
[18:31] alright the deity of Jesus Christ number
[18:34] one this is the first prayer that that
[18:37] we showed brother Branham he's praying
[18:38] here now watch now start a revival in
[18:41] the hearts of the people this morning
[18:43] this is in 1949 and I want you to see
[18:47] how in 1964 brother Branham now watch
[18:49] what he's doing in this he says now
[18:52] start a revival in the hearts of the
[18:53] people look at me in the hearts of the
[18:56] people bring a revival in the hearts of
[18:59] the people this morning Lord made us be
[19:01] a renewing time a time when the Spirit
[19:03] will be renewed and Oh father we'd pray
[19:06] it this way come get us by the hand each
[19:10] one of us and walk us down this Lane
[19:13] here show to us this great picture that
[19:17] said in order here revealing your
[19:19] secrets to the Saints hearts this
[19:20] morning that we might see once out just
[19:23] before us as we walk down Lord in the
[19:28] armor of God may we go as gallant
[19:30] soldiers to face the enemy but how could
[19:32] we face him unless we know his tactics
[19:36] and keep us this morning to understand
[19:37] the show is for four grounds there so
[19:40] we'll know where to meet him for we ask
[19:41] it in Jesus name
[19:42] hey man that's 1949 hang on a minute
[19:44] we're not done 1964 this is the one that
[19:48] that sister Esther brought to me I'm
[19:50] pretty sure I had it in my notes of the
[19:52] 1,200 quotes that I've gotten but but
[19:54] what's this now watch brother branham is
[19:57] not talking to the congregation 1949 he
[20:02] said we he said us the people listen to
[20:07] this prayer 1964 God created me I
[20:11] circled every one of these a revival let
[20:14] me be the revival let each one of us be
[20:20] the revival the revival in me make me
[20:25] Lord that's our problem we look at
[20:28] everybody else's problem that means

[20:57] seals have already broke he's at the end
[20:58] of his ministry and he still tenth want
[21:00] God he's talking personally to God I
[21:03] created me more able more humbler more
[21:09] kinder more willing to work more looking
[21:13] to the things that are positive and
[21:16] forgetting the things that are in the
[21:18] past
[21:19] that's what brother Nate was talking
[21:21] about Sunday and Saturday and the
[21:24] negatives if we keep hanging on
[21:26] negatives you're not gonna get anywhere
[21:28] let me press toward the mark of the high
[21:30] calling of Christ amen that's on my
[21:33] refrigerator because it's nice talking
[21:35] about me I'm not talking about Jim know
[21:37] about me amen
[21:39] make me Lord make me a better servant
[21:42] Lord of Mercy make me created me of
[21:45] revival let me be the River
[21:48] who was what was a Welsh revival where's
[21:53] the Welsh revival mr. policeman he said
[21:55] looking at it you know what brother Bram
[21:58] used that over and over so it must have
[22:00] been true that revival was in that
[22:03] policeman that was walking down the road
[22:04] can it being us but now look at number
[22:08] three
[22:09] but how does this come about the angel
[22:12] of the Lord 1951 and when we see these
[22:14] crowds gathering that doesn't mean we
[22:16] revival that's just the gathering but a
[22:19] revival is when people get really right
[22:21] with God and pray through we were
[22:23] talking about Sunday school and
[22:25] different ones there in Bible study the
[22:28] reason that we know we have the Holy
[22:30] Ghost is what one thing the Bible tells
[22:33] us sighing and crying for the
[22:35] abomination done in the city sign and
[22:38] crime for the abomination done in what's
[22:39] going on in the message and then but you
[22:43] got to go back to personal let me start
[22:45] the revival let me be the one that it
[22:49] starts in that policeman was so proud
[22:51] that that Welsh revival was in him not
[22:54] in his neighbor but if it's if it was in
[22:57] his neighbor and his neighbor neighbor
[22:58] confessed it what a revival but remember
[23:03] it's not going to be a revival of
[23:04] putting up tents and the music's not
[23:08] going to get you know we're not gonna
[23:09] hire a worship team to come in you know
[23:11] and try to get some of y'all alive so
[23:14] maybe - raise your hand
[23:15] put a little bindi on your arm raise
[23:17] your hand and when you see these crowds
[23:20] gathering that doesn't mean revival
[23:22] that's just the gathering but a revival
[23:24] when the people get really right with
[23:26] God and pray through Bob cry for that
[23:36] boy pray through cry for your children
[23:39] have you ever prayed through for your
[23:41] kids get desperate we're just not
[23:45] desperate enough and pray through and
[23:49] start a revival throughout the city but
[23:51] I'll promise you one thing Bob was
[23:55] sending me a message today and we'll
[23:57] talk about that later but you know I
[24:00] thought well
[24:01] you know if it's like me you you pray
[24:04] without ceasing you we've all got our
[24:05] little things that we you know we can
[24:07] sit somewhere but let's don't make it so
[24:09] cath late to where we gotta you know sit
[24:12] down and put the cross in front of us
[24:14] and no you to pray through would be you
[24:17] could be driving down the road and just
[24:19] praying through you know I mean that's
[24:23] to me that's some of the best prayers
[24:24] especially when you're driving and
[24:26] people want to cut you off from the road
[24:27] you start praying that the Lord will
[24:29] help you get through but you start you
[24:32] think about your family and you think
[24:33] about these different things that were
[24:35] that we're dealing with in life I'm
[24:37] talking to you as a family you deal with
[24:39] things in your life you got to deal with
[24:41] them personally you got us you got you
[24:43] know I can't I can't sign Cry 4 for
[24:46] Caitlin Zoe as much as I wouldn't Deanna
[24:49] our my own daughter my son why because
[24:51] they're not mine but I still cried and
[24:53] pray for them - okay well that's why we
[24:55] need to do you say well what do we need
[24:58] we need to pray more read our Bible more
[25:01] brother branham's to get closer to God
[25:02] reads the Bible and pray and I will
[25:05] include listening to a few messages if
[25:07] you don't mind
[25:08] amen start a revival throughout the city
[25:12] and everything you see they put away sin
[25:14] put away their iniquity turn to God turn
[25:17] around and start back again alright
[25:20] looking number four now what is a
[25:22] revival it's just a stirring up of what
[25:25] you already got now listen we should
[25:27] have a coffer fall of the truth I'm
[25:33] telling you but the letter will kill you
[25:37] if you don't bring it from here to here
[25:40] it's not stirring up this it's stirring
[25:45] up what's in here amen sure I know it's
[25:48] got to drop down we know that we know
[25:49] it's connected but still a revelation
[25:52] comes from your heart not from your
[25:55] brain amen
[25:58] it comes from your heart not from up
[26:00] here I wished everything up here was
[26:02] quickened down here but not yet but it's
[26:03] going that it's getting there if you're
[26:06] what open yourself up and let God do it
[26:09] so we want to just start what we already
[26:10] have number five now Minister cannot
[26:12] bring a revival
[26:13] there's no preacher can bring a
[26:15] revival so don't look to me a brother
[26:17] down oh look the Bob just gonna come up
[26:19] here well that's what we think we think
[26:21] well we're gonna have one great message
[26:23] and all of a sudden all of us are gonna
[26:24] start that's not what's gonna happen
[26:28] it's got to start with you guys it's got
[26:32] to start with you and me when I'm
[26:34] sitting here it's got to start with us
[26:39] because the preacher don't have it
[26:41] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[26:44] he doesn't pack it with him and the only
[26:46] thing he can do is just be loyal to God
[26:48] in his word and we believe brother Dale
[26:50] is and the ministry here and the revival
[26:52] has to come by the people in your home
[26:55] in your life now a revival isn't adding
[26:58] new members to the church its reviving
[27:01] that what we've already got we should be
[27:05] able to root being a could perpetual
[27:08] revival in the Word of God that we've
[27:11] had here for the fifty years that we've
[27:12] been in this church and the man some of
[27:15] you may have not been here that long but
[27:16] you know what let month our workers get
[27:18] the same pay eleventh-hour kurz gets us
[27:22] and you know what Freda that makes you
[27:24] happy right I had somebody ask me
[27:27] something several years ago from here
[27:29] and say brother brother Dale brother way
[27:32] like I don't know if I can catch up I've
[27:36] been out for so long
[27:38] make yourself available to God you make
[27:42] yourself available to God he'll fill you
[27:44] up that levinthal worker got exactly the
[27:47] same pay let me read this again God's
[27:50] Word has to come to pass and if you're
[27:54] an eleventh-hour worker you will get
[27:56] your portion the same as the people
[27:59] that's been here just reading what the
[28:03] Bible says all right it's reviving what
[28:06] we've already got
[28:07] number six believe it's now this what we
[28:10] need today is an old fashioned God's
[28:12] tent revival clean up the home clean up
[28:15] the heart get things ready so you see
[28:17] what you got to do we got to clean
[28:19] ourselves up clean up the heart get
[28:22] things ready start a revival in your
[28:23] home and it'll begin at the church
[28:25] preachers don't bring it in his
[28:27] briefcase
[28:28] I wish I wish we could bring a revival
[28:31] and just throw it out all over the but
[28:33] God sends it from heaven to the
[28:36] individuals individuals you could be in
[28:41] a revival right now and your neighbor be
[28:44] as dead as a hammer that's just the way
[28:48] God is number seven getting in the
[28:50] spirit that's the way you get a revival
[28:53] that's when you really get in the spirit
[28:55] of a revival now what is this period of
[28:57] a revival reviving what you already have
[29:01] not whooping it up or something
[29:04] that's been the whole thing everybody's
[29:07] wanting to waiting on this last revival
[29:08] that the bride's fixing the ham and they
[29:10] think it's going to be some signs and
[29:12] wonders and great miracles that's not
[29:14] what this says listen it will come with
[29:18] it have you all been healed in the past
[29:23] ten years ninety percent what a revival
[29:30] most people can't say that but we have
[29:34] been in a revival I just want to help
[29:39] you realize when it comes that's what
[29:41] that's our job is to help you realize
[29:43] I'm in a revival maybe I didn't know
[29:47] what remember I was telling you the
[29:48] other day or we were talking downstairs
[29:52] somebody says well what are we doing
[29:54] here may we wear this and wear that we
[29:55] can't do this we can't do this we can't
[29:57] do that I said look brother branham had
[29:59] a vision of shooting a bear and there
[30:05] was a man there he saw his hand but he
[30:08] didn't see his face and he saw a green
[30:10] check his shirt we know that was brother
[30:13] Bisco right now when brother Bisco tells
[30:15] his story of that he says I put that
[30:18] shirt on he said brother Brown told us
[30:20] the whole thing was going to happen I
[30:22] put the shirt on he said for two hours I
[30:25] walked in that vision for two hours
[30:28] before I looked down and realized
[30:30] there's the bear here's the guy with the
[30:33] green ticket shirt and there's my hand
[30:34] even had a small had a smart member
[30:36] brother on say that small hand he was
[30:39] two hours in a super 9
[30:42] trol vision and didn't even know it
[30:44] that's what I'm saying we could already
[30:46] be in the greatest revival that you ever
[30:48] been and you just don't know it yet but
[30:50] boy when you do know it what the brother
[30:53] will say he said I knew it was
[30:55] gonna happen then he might have had you
[30:58] know remember he was adapting our
[30:59] brother madam I can see all the way to
[31:01] the horses remember he was the guy I see
[31:03] all the way to them horses they ain't a
[31:05] bear no are you sure brother branham he
[31:07] just and i'm sure brother rams looking
[31:09] at the green checkered shirt and going
[31:10] yeah I'm sure it's gonna happen yeah and
[31:13] him going I don't know brother round
[31:14] brother Ram look at that green taking
[31:16] surgeon I know it's gonna happen Michael
[31:18] he saw the man in the green second sure
[31:19] but the guy was a green checkered shirt
[31:20] that was part of the vision had no clue
[31:23] for two hours and you know what when
[31:27] that bark when that bear pumped up down
[31:29] that Valley
[31:30] I believe brother Briscoe man look down
[31:33] at that green second shirt and said I
[31:35] think he's gonna hit it I think you
[31:39] don't hit that bear cuz you realized
[31:40] where he was that well that's the way it
[31:42] is with preaching the gospel I want us
[31:44] to realize that we've come from
[31:46] somewhere and we have arrived at a
[31:49] position we've arrived at a position
[31:51] that we need to go on with God just a
[31:54] little more going a little more with God
[31:56] go up a little come up higher we're in
[31:59] that third day period
[32:00] amen all right in your home in your life
[32:03] what number in my own seven all right
[32:05] look don't whoop it up or something but
[32:08] by praying it down until there's a
[32:13] revival strikes what your heart not hear
[32:17] your heart until all the logs of
[32:22] Ecclesiastes amol the logs the
[32:24] fanaticism all the logs of system and
[32:26] all the logs of unbelief flow out excuse
[32:30] me and then the waters now what's waters
[32:32] revival their revival of God comes
[32:34] falling down upon you not upon the whole
[32:38] group on you all right
[32:41] number eight we'll get down to number
[32:44] nine and then we'll go into the church
[32:45] ages from it excuse me
[32:47] old Christians friend o Christian people
[32:50] bind yourself together with one heart
[32:52] and one Accord for God cannot no more
[32:55] send the gifts to the church while the
[32:58] church is separated that's why we're
[33:04] without gifts were separated right maybe
[33:08] not so much separated with belief but we
[33:10] may have separated ourselves for God
[33:13] cannot no more send the gifts to the
[33:15] church while the church is separated
[33:17] then he can send the Holy Ghost unless
[33:20] you're in one Accord that's right for it
[33:23] comes by the Holy Ghost believe it
[33:25] alright let's go to number nine and then
[33:28] we'll make some comments here that's the
[33:33] reason we can't have a revival you've
[33:35] got to get back to God's faith again in
[33:37] the Bible where men and women become
[33:40] born-again and regenerated by the Holy
[33:42] Ghost then that man can't help from
[33:45] being a Christian he's a Christian by
[33:47] birth you don't have to pledge him give
[33:51] him cards and visit him that's babies
[34:01] you don't have to pledge him give him
[34:03] cards and visiting I'm reading you the
[34:04] prophets quote here if he's born again
[34:07] brother you almost have to bar the door
[34:09] to keep him out hmm you almost have to
[34:15] borrow the door to keep him out of hot
[34:16] wind done that yet we had to but what
[34:21] happens is now they don't have these so
[34:25] they wanted to go and read it in my
[34:26] Bible but if you'll go if you want to go
[34:27] to revelations chapter 2 because what
[34:31] happens at a revival began on the day of
[34:34] Pentecost ad 30 not back we're not
[34:38] talking about zoo the street at the
[34:39] moment but back 80 30 there was a
[34:41] revival come down and you say well no
[34:44] that wasn't yes it was a resurrection
[34:46] but it revived what would they had
[34:48] already held for three and a half years
[34:50] they were a little bit more special than
[34:51] most people they had to word himself
[34:54] tell them and they packed it in his
[34:56] brother down shoulders they took the
[34:59] word and held it and they held it until
[35:01] it was quickened and then what did they
[35:03] do they didn't stay in the upper room
[35:05] they went out
[35:06] and they want manifested what was
[35:09] already inside of them but he had to be
[35:12] quickened first everybody got that say
[35:14] ma'am all right and so they went out to
[35:16] the people they preach the gospel but
[35:19] what happened the zeal began to fall
[35:22] away chapter 2 verse 4 now Ephesus was a
[35:29] mighty Church they did not have a
[35:33] doctrine of a false baptism they did not
[35:37] have a trinity to worry with they did
[35:39] not have an eternal hell to worry with
[35:41] they didn't have all these doctrines
[35:43] that we have now to worry with they were
[35:46] the pure Church nevertheless verse 4 I
[35:51] have somewhat against thee now he's not
[35:54] talking to the world he's talking to the
[35:57] bride he's talking to the bride of that
[36:01] age you have got away from your first
[36:04] love and that was just a very short
[36:08] period of time from ad 30 of course John
[36:12] wrote this in 1896 but the efforts in
[36:14] church age started back in eighty fifty
[36:15] something or thirty something all
[36:17] waiting to fit something okay you have
[36:19] already remember therefore from whence
[36:23] thou has fallen and repent and do the
[36:27] first words we're going to cover this
[36:30] more Sunday what's the first words the
[36:34] works you started with clean up the home
[36:41] do the right thing
[36:44] communion foot washing
[36:46] what about ISM make sure that's all
[36:48] right make sure you're doing those
[36:50] things but if you don't I'm going to
[36:53] come quickly and remove that count state
[36:55] in other words he's going to remove your
[36:56] joy just like brother Dale was talking
[36:58] about Satan is going to come in and he's
[37:00] going to what grab your joy he's gonna
[37:03] pull it right out of you that's not a
[37:07] revival no no we want a revival to keep
[37:13] going and you know what God did keep
[37:15] going because even though he said
[37:17] emphasis you've fallen away from you
[37:20] first love but nevertheless we're going
[37:24] to continue on but see verse 6 but this
[37:27] thou hast thou hatest the deeds of the
[37:29] Nicolaitans which also hate so he told
[37:32] them you've fallen away from your first
[37:34] love but there are some things I like
[37:35] about you a man that ought to make you
[37:39] happy and it's not something your
[37:41] neighbor thinks it's good about just
[37:42] what God says good about you ma'am all
[37:46] right now let's go to chapter 2 verse 9
[37:51] and this is the smyrna church age i know
[37:59] thy works and tribulation and poverty
[38:00] but thou are rich and I know the
[38:03] blasphemy of them which say they are
[38:04] Jews and or not
[38:05] we're at the synagogue of Satan fear
[38:08] none of those things which thou shalt
[38:10] suffer behold the devil cast something
[38:12] in the prison you may be tried you'll
[38:13] have tribulation 10 days be thou
[38:15] faithful unto death and I'll give you a
[38:17] crown of life all right but remember
[38:19] there's a church age all right if I
[38:25] should have brought my shark because we
[38:27] remember the chart we did with the
[38:28] poured room we've been through it about
[38:29] the church age messengers where the
[38:31] porter stands in the gap because
[38:33] remember each church age should lap over
[38:35] it's not Church ages like this if you
[38:38] hadn't will make all over it again for
[38:40] those who knew we got a lot of new
[38:41] people but but there was there was a
[38:43] church age messenger remember the Holy
[38:46] Ghost came under their Pentecost let me
[38:47] just run through it real quick Holy
[38:48] Ghost came under their Pentecost that
[38:50] was the messenger to the Pentecostal age
[38:53] amen then Paul comes at the end of that
[38:57] Pentecostal age and brings his message
[38:59] to Ephesus
[39:00] well those Pentecostals started getting
[39:02] away from their first love God put a
[39:05] profit on the scene what to call them
[39:07] back to revive them sure they was people
[39:10] got born again but you know what listen
[39:13] when you see those circles out through
[39:15] there they brother Branham drew remember
[39:19] they're not separated thank you I love
[39:25] them guys back there
[39:26] here's the Pentecostal age Paul comes at
[39:29] the end of Pentecost brings his message
[39:32] as we preach
[39:33] here but what happened Paul was a
[39:36] messenger give a message when off the
[39:38] scene what's the first thing happened
[39:39] they started falling away now as they
[39:43] fell away now look hold on a minute this
[39:46] is not really correct remember they went
[39:50] people got born again with Paul and all
[39:51] of a sudden nobody else got born again
[39:53] until Iran has come on the scene that's
[39:55] not true God's always had bride on the
[39:58] face of the earth since the day of
[40:00] Pentecost there's never been a day when
[40:02] there hadn't been a bride on the day of
[40:03] pending I want since the day of
[40:04] Pentecost amen so that's really not
[40:09] correct but brother Bram said they lap
[40:10] over like this there's a lap over
[40:13] because what happens is look at the
[40:15] curvature they start going down God
[40:17] sends a porter which is Irene yes he
[40:20] didn't send Iranians over here he's
[40:22] seeing Irina sin the first of the church
[40:24] age everybody got that thing man all
[40:27] right there was a porter or one standing
[40:29] at the door to introduce Christ to the
[40:31] people and Irina says aids you can read
[40:33] it in the Bible they come and had a
[40:35] great age but then what happened at the
[40:37] end of the age that was a falling away
[40:39] they needed a revival that wasn't they
[40:42] needed more Christians they needed to
[40:43] revive what was already there so they
[40:46] come into a revival now that Martin
[40:48] comes on the scene right here brings his
[40:51] message to the Pergamon church age they
[40:54] do the same identical thing a band flow
[40:57] a band flow because you can read it
[41:00] let's read the next one verse 14 of that
[41:02] same
[41:03] this will be the pergamene church age I
[41:06] know that works
[41:07] we're thou dwellest even where Satan's
[41:09] seat is but look but I have a few things
[41:12] against thee just a few let's don't
[41:16] throw the baby out with the bathwater
[41:18] just a few things I have against you let
[41:23] me tell you something real quick I'm
[41:25] talking to all of you you better be
[41:27] quiet about what you say about your
[41:29] brother and sister I'm telling all of
[41:32] you because you in trouble with God
[41:34] brother Brown stood and he called them
[41:36] people Rickey's and Rick Evans for about
[41:39] three years I got the quote right in
[41:41] there God said you shut up those are my
[41:44] people and man am I telling you what
[41:47] brother what
[41:47] I told brother branham about him calling
[41:50] Ricky's and Rick at us he said those are
[41:52] my people they're just caught in a
[41:54] system you know what he was telling them
[41:56] he said you'd be quite because they're
[41:57] boarding in people out there you better
[41:59] be quiet about what you say about your
[42:01] brother and sister there's only one
[42:03] judge I'd just be careful you might get
[42:12] you candlestick pulled out but I have a
[42:16] few things against thee thou hast there
[42:17] them that hold the doctrine of Balaam
[42:19] huh it crept in the church but God
[42:27] allowed it memory is not talking to the
[42:31] world where did it creep into it crept
[42:34] into this perk of me in church age
[42:39] that's why I did what no it wasn't a big
[42:42] surprise that we got all these doctrines
[42:45] in the message it's happened since the
[42:49] dawn of time remember who was that
[42:52] Sorrenti us in the first church age was
[42:55] preaching that Jesus was a light
[42:57] substance of God just like the preaching
[42:59] now that Jesus wasn't gone to the River
[43:01] Jordan same devil different name
[43:05] remember those demons don't die they
[43:07] just hop and skip right through the
[43:08] church ages and man and sadly into the
[43:12] church
[43:22] all right just sort of something but
[43:24] I'll hold it tight IRA look at verse 19
[43:31] to verse 19 I know thy works and charity
[43:36] and service and faith he he gave them
[43:40] the message of the hour their message of
[43:43] the hour but look at verse 20
[43:46] notwithstanding I have a few things
[43:48] against thee now listen he didn't throw
[43:49] the age out he didn't throw the
[43:51] Christian people out he didn't throw the
[43:53] born-again he didn't throw his sons and
[43:55] daughters out but he did give them a
[43:58] rebuke by the Word of God by a preacher
[44:01] men not women because thou sufferest
[44:07] that woman Jezebel you let her come in
[44:11] and try to run the church it's exactly
[44:18] what that says cuz now suffer what did
[44:20] you guys about one of those she want to
[44:22] take over she wanted to kill the true
[44:24] people of God she wanted to take over
[44:26] which calleth herself a prophetess oh I
[44:30] got the message I've been here for 50
[44:31] years
[44:34] better be careful to teach and seduce
[44:37] what my servants to commit fornication
[44:39] and eat things sacrificed I'll that's
[44:41] what they had to put up with and I put
[44:42] the church ages back up here I gave her
[44:45] a place to risk repent and she repented
[44:47] not that was the problem that was a
[44:49] separation she didn't repent but the
[44:50] rest of them did go back to here now so
[44:53] we see that in each of these ages God
[44:56] brings a message and a messenger what at
[44:59] the end of the previous age so this is
[45:03] where the falling away sad the falling
[45:05] away is not here though that's a revival
[45:07] here the the trees growing all they're
[45:10] bringing people in and this new message
[45:12] of Martin is coming in and he's bringing
[45:14] but then what happen the devil gets in
[45:18] the church and starts driving it back
[45:21] down so what happened all the way down
[45:23] to the Holy Ghost coming the same way as
[45:28] it did at Pentecost there had to be
[45:32] profit come at the end of the
[45:34] Pentecostal age go see that was an
[45:35] important age that was the pure Holy
[45:38] Ghost falling on believers hundred
[45:41] twenty the upper room in 3000 downstairs
[45:43] which started Christendom which started
[45:45] the church ages but then we come down to
[45:48] right here and remember brother Branham
[45:52] was the one to put that light right
[45:53] there the angel blacked it all out he
[45:57] said I added that little bit of light so
[46:01] the Holy Ghost come we're on Azusa
[46:03] Street to restore the gifts at the end
[46:07] of Wesley's age no messenger to the aged
[46:10] brother Branham wasn't a messenger to
[46:12] penticoff just as Paul wasn't a
[46:16] messenger depending off Paul was a
[46:18] messenger to the fees in church age
[46:21] brother Branham comes at the end of the
[46:23] Pentecostal age and brings his message
[46:25] now remember this man's special these
[46:29] people have one thing to do bring a
[46:31] bride rebuke the world and break a
[46:35] plague on the earth now brother Branham
[46:39] is a little bit different because
[46:40] there's no other Church age that this is
[46:43] going to fall away and then we're going
[46:45] to go back into the same thing again so
[46:48] brother Branham he said this messenger
[46:49] of Malachi forced to do two things
[46:50] number one turn the hearts of the white
[46:54] children children babbling Pentecostal
[46:58] babies trying to grow them up in God
[47:02] back to the faith of the fathers which
[47:05] is where's the faith of the fathers
[47:07] right here restore it back to here and
[47:09] then bring his message the second part
[47:12] of his message which was the seals and
[47:14] that put brother Branham in this slot
[47:16] here to preach us right on into eternity
[47:19] amen he restored all the way through
[47:23] here to remember he said I'm not the
[47:24] best you've led to see if he was he
[47:26] would be right here he's not there he's
[47:28] out he come at the end of the age just
[47:33] real simple excuse me all right let's go
[47:36] let's leave that up but you see what God
[47:41] holds this pattern
[47:48] let's skip over here just a little bit
[47:50] want to be too long let's go to chapter
[47:56] 3 verse 14 let's go to little layout of
[47:58] scene let's see this is our age so we
[48:00] should know what this is to the Angel of
[48:03] the church and Levison's write these
[48:04] things saith the Amen the faithful and
[48:06] true witness the beginning of the
[48:07] creation of God I know that works that
[48:10] thou art neither : heart now remember in
[48:12] this church age there is no salutation
[48:16] of your doing very good
[48:19] it starts off that you're not doing very
[48:22] well to the angel the church the left
[48:24] sins right these things that the Amen
[48:26] the faithful and true witness the
[48:27] beginning the creation of God I know thy
[48:30] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[48:32] I would thou wert cold or hot so then
[48:36] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[48:39] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[48:41] mouth because down slashed I am rich and
[48:45] increased with Goods and have need of
[48:46] nothing no absolutely that's already and
[48:48] knowest not that thou art wretched
[48:51] miserable poor blind and naked but
[48:58] brothers and sisters I counsel thee to
[49:00] buy of me by of God gold tried in the
[49:04] fire that thou mayst be rich and white
[49:08] raiment that thou mayst be clothed and
[49:10] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[49:13] appear and anoint thine eyes with
[49:15] eyesalve that they may see as many as i
[49:18] love i rebuke and chasten be zealous
[49:20] therefore and repent in other words to
[49:24] behold i stand at the door knock If any
[49:26] man hear my voice and open the door
[49:27] remember the door didn't have a knob on
[49:30] the outside the son of man who got put
[49:33] out of the church so it was a man
[49:35] standing there knocking on the door they
[49:38] put brother around him when he started
[49:39] preaching the son of man message that's
[49:41] when they put him out they loved him and
[49:44] all that wonderful thing all the way up
[49:46] to where he comes up to 1963 and he says
[49:49] spoken words original seed in 1962 he
[49:51] says thousands of my friends will leave
[49:53] me why he was bringing a doctrine he was
[49:56] bringing his message
[49:57] that he was supposed to bring being the
[50:01] Elijah of this in town everybody got
[50:08] that seem in to him that overcometh
[50:16] nobody in any church age has got this
[50:20] close to God no one you've got all these
[50:24] different things doctrine of balaam and
[50:26] you've got all these and I rebuke you
[50:28] but I love you and I chasing you and all
[50:30] these different things but look at this
[50:32] one right here this is this is the
[50:34] closest we're gonna get to him that
[50:38] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[50:41] didn't say on my throne it says in my
[50:46] throne Saint John 17 Lord I pray that
[50:51] they are one as you and I are one even
[50:56] as also I have overcome and set down
[50:58] with my father in his throne there was a
[51:01] revival listen this message doesn't need
[51:07] a revival it's the pure message but
[51:11] without you it's nothing so you are the
[51:16] message you bring you bring the revival
[51:18] because brother Ram said as long as it
[51:20] lays on these pages that's what they're
[51:23] doing now because they don't have the
[51:26] Holy Ghost to quicken what's on the
[51:27] pages they're just reading the quotes
[51:29] and going I don't believe that all right
[51:31] I don't think he was there when that
[51:33] happened there I don't think this and I
[51:34] don't think that and he said this wrong
[51:36] and he said that wrong come on people it
[51:43] told us in the Bible what they were
[51:45] gonna do and we still marvel but God's
[51:50] Word has to come to pass doesn't matter
[51:53] if it's the rebuke he's got to come to
[51:55] pass doesn't matter if it's the glory
[51:57] it's got to come to pass but it's you
[52:01] and I our free moral agency that decides
[52:05] where we're at so all God's got this
[52:09] thing figured out yeah he's got to
[52:10] figure it out but
[52:11] figured out because of what you're doing
[52:15] we don't believe in predestination where
[52:17] God puts you in a tube and just pulled
[52:19] you through it do we know he knew what
[52:22] she was going to do go on your way
[52:24] through the tube so he had what he had
[52:27] the word sitting here for you desire it
[52:31] if you desire it he's got the word
[52:33] sitting here
[52:34] you don't desire it then you gonna stand
[52:36] at the dead judgment he's going to say I
[52:38] laid the core I laid the full course
[52:40] seven course meal laughter in front of
[52:41] you and you didn't eat it he was eating
[52:44] crumbs or you was chewing on the only
[52:46] chewing on the plate amen now look go to
[52:53] the next quote now look in the church
[52:55] ages now we know I told you about the
[52:57] Great Awakening that happened in the
[52:59] different in the different times with
[53:01] Luther and Westland we know all that
[53:04] brother Browns told us all that we've
[53:06] come to Luther Wesley of Sankey Calvin
[53:10] Finlay Zuza Street brother Billy Graham
[53:17] all Roberts all these different ones but
[53:20] remember that revival may have saved
[53:23] people and it didn't revive some of the
[53:26] things that they were that they were
[53:27] going through but this revival if
[53:29] brother Branham is correct I'm telling
[53:30] you this not me if brother Browns
[53:33] correct this is going to be a word
[53:34] revival and it will not be a public show
[53:39] so it's not going to be down there in
[53:42] Florida in Orlando where they're having
[53:44] you know 17 straight months of revival
[53:47] the whole world knows that check that
[53:50] one off sure they can listen not seeing
[53:54] anything about them they probably
[53:55] getting people saved they're getting
[53:58] people to live better they're getting
[54:00] people to do what their denomination
[54:02] says but it's not
[54:04] they can't revive the word back into
[54:06] power again this is what we're trying to
[54:08] do we're trying to this word is
[54:10] all-powerful but you and I make it of
[54:14] none effect you and I make it if not
[54:20] effect by the things that we do Jesus
[54:22] stood and said you make the word of none
[54:24] of
[54:24] by your traditions what's our tradition
[54:33] big one brother branham said when the
[54:37] revival comes look what's always come
[54:41] when it come in the days of Jesus just
[54:44] in the minority just a few people look
[54:48] what John had there on the bank
[54:50] John was the greatest prophet that ever
[54:53] hit the face of the earth besides Jesus
[54:54] Christ right you know what Brooklyn and
[54:55] what Jesus said and he had just a
[54:58] handful of people just a few people
[55:01] gathered around from the regions around
[55:03] about to hear him about 99 percent of
[55:05] them rejected his message and walked
[55:07] away yet it was a great revival in a
[55:11] shaking time God shakes things and
[55:14] people don't realize it's being done see
[55:20] God shakes his church the revival is to
[55:24] his church I believe the church is
[55:25] called out now but the thing to revive
[55:28] us is to revive and shake that church to
[55:31] its place again amen you want to know
[55:35] how to shake it let's read this I like
[55:38] this this is neat kind of a long quote
[55:41] if we would all take this approach wake
[55:44] up
[55:45] Jesus Wednesday people come on grief
[55:48] come on wake up your soul is worth more
[55:52] than sleep all right let's read this
[55:55] quote number 11 greatest battle ever
[55:58] fought this guy's name is Peter
[56:00] Cartwright he's a Christian let's get
[56:04] that started right to start with you got
[56:05] it
[56:05] like Peter Cartwright went into a city
[56:08] said Lord told me to come in here and
[56:11] have a revival he rented an old
[56:13] storeroom got in there began to clean it
[56:15] up now this is the Christian man fixing
[56:17] started reliable let's see how he starts
[56:20] it and the big bully of the town the
[56:23] pistol hanging on his sidewalk down got
[56:26] doors some of them said what's that guy
[56:28] doing down there said he's a preacher
[56:30] he's gonna have a meeting he said well
[56:33] guess I'll just have to go down there
[56:35] and throw him out in the street and run
[56:37] him over run him out of here that
[56:38] so we don't want no meeting around here
[56:40] that's what the devil's been telling us
[56:42] so he goes down there stomp the door
[56:45] Peter Cartwright had his coat on you
[56:47] know he was just washing the windows and
[56:49] walk walls down a little bitty fella
[56:52] you know wasn't a linebacker for the
[56:58] whatever a little bitty fella you know
[57:01] the old preacher laughed at him you know
[57:03] for eating chicken with his hands which
[57:05] is etiquette today amen you know so he
[57:08] was just washing the windows and fixing
[57:10] around the big bully walked over pulled
[57:12] his coke back pistol hanging on inside
[57:14] what are you doing oh I'm washing
[57:17] windows and just kept on washing the
[57:18] windows you know he had one purpose
[57:20] listen he had one purpose he didn't care
[57:23] about that guy he had one purpose God
[57:27] told him to hold a revival washing the
[57:30] windows on down I mean this guy was what
[57:32] cleaning his house we don't allow
[57:36] revivals around here oh but the Lord
[57:40] told me to hold this revival see he just
[57:42] kept on out how did this work see see
[57:45] well they said there's one thing you
[57:46] have to understand I run this town
[57:48] around here the devil said he said oh
[57:53] you do and just kept on washing the
[57:54] windows this guy's got a lot of faith he
[57:58] said before you have a revival you got
[58:00] to whip me first
[58:01] little bitty fella this guy had a gun oh
[58:05] I do well I'll just do that next he took
[58:12] off his coat looked over and reached him
[58:14] by the collar and knocked him down the
[58:15] floor jumped on top of him and said I
[58:17] must fight if I should rain I must fight
[58:20] if I should rain increase my courage
[58:22] Lord pounded the tar out of him said you
[58:27] get enough he said yes he got up and
[58:31] shook his hand he got saved that night
[58:33] in church now we know the devil can't
[58:36] get saved but you see what the influence
[58:39] of a man that didn't let circumstances
[58:42] bother him he was washing the windows he
[58:47] went depending on somebody else to clean
[58:48] the house up he was
[58:50] in it and when the devil showed up he
[58:52] just turned around looked at him and
[58:53] said I got a purpose God told me I can
[58:57] have a revival in this building right
[58:59] here in this building right here I'm
[59:06] gonna have a revival and if I got a whip
[59:09] you devil no problem
[59:12] what brother bomb said you know he got
[59:14] that man down and he said kept saying
[59:16] boo devil faith these arms got great big
[59:20] then you know
[59:21] Satan's a bluff let's read number 12 I
[59:29] must fight if I should ring I think we
[59:33] ought to keep that one somewhere I must
[59:36] fight if I should reign increase my
[59:38] courage Lord all right number 12 let's
[59:40] read this and it will be done
[59:41] excuse me I lost you the Prophet 1956
[59:45] mothers of old they love to raise their
[59:47] children but hold this modern America
[59:49] day that we're living in them I tell you
[59:52] our nation is simply polluted there's
[59:54] not a hope left of this nation as I see
[59:56] only an old-fashioned revival according
[59:59] to the scripture it'll never be
[1:00:01] nationwide so then we're just left it'll
[1:00:05] be a revival among the people , the
[1:00:08] elect of God but it won't be a real
[1:00:12] sweeping revival take the whole nation
[1:00:14] in never was never will be so if this
[1:00:19] thing gets beyond these walls maybe it's
[1:00:24] in another Church mmm may be able to get
[1:00:27] out but still I want to have a revival
[1:00:28] here it's what I told the young people I
[1:00:32] I don't I don't ever look and see who
[1:00:35] takes communion unless I'm in
[1:00:37] ministering the communion not because
[1:00:39] that's not my business
[1:00:40] it's not our business to know what
[1:00:42] somebody says up here in the pulpit with
[1:00:44] prayer and all this things in our
[1:00:45] business but I would love that every
[1:00:48] person in I told them I said we make
[1:00:50] communion wine for this church mom and
[1:00:53] dad does and they make it a gallon or
[1:00:56] two at a time
[1:00:57] I wish they'd make a gallon every month
[1:00:59] I don't think they'd mind either
[1:01:03] I wish we could fill them stack them up
[1:01:06] this high because if you take communion
[1:01:08] and if you prayed up
[1:01:11] you read what the scripture says but if
[1:01:15] you don't you're eating and drinking
[1:01:16] come that condemnation to yourself but
[1:01:18] if you're not you're in the service of
[1:01:20] God see what I mean young people anybody
[1:01:23] if you don't take communion that shows
[1:01:24] you're not where you should be well it
[1:01:27] shows you where you're not at so do
[1:01:29] something about it that's why say a
[1:01:31] communion is a face-to-face but what is
[1:01:33] communion communion is a face-to-face
[1:01:36] opportunity to say God I love you my
[1:01:40] life is as clean as I can get it hey I
[1:01:46] was just I was just listening you heard
[1:01:47] that tape brother Brent said I'll have a
[1:01:50] bride without spot or wrinkle it's up to
[1:01:56] him to do it but he's gonna do it
[1:01:57] through me in you so when you stand to
[1:02:00] take communion if you have no spot or no
[1:02:02] wrinkle guess what you're standing at a
[1:02:04] place that God can commune with you
[1:02:05] right then in there he's so close so
[1:02:09] that's what communion is coming it's not
[1:02:11] bread and wine it's a symbol that you
[1:02:15] can communicate with your lover the Lord
[1:02:18] Jesus Christ it won't be a real sweeping
[1:02:22] revival take the whole nation never has
[1:02:23] and never will be
[1:02:25] all right now look third seal we've read
[1:02:29] this and I'm gonna read it again then
[1:02:30] we'll read one more we'll be finished
[1:02:35] now that's the reasons today that the
[1:02:37] revivals that we're supposed to have we
[1:02:40] have denominational revivals now look we
[1:02:43] haven't had a real stirring now remember
[1:02:45] let's go back to the other quotes where
[1:02:46] he says it's not going to be a whoopin
[1:02:48] and a hollering and a got it so he's not
[1:02:51] talking about a whoopin and Hollerin
[1:02:54] right
[1:02:55] we have denominational revivals we
[1:02:57] haven't had a real stirring no no no no
[1:03:01] sir don't think we got revivals so you
[1:03:04] can't have a word revival when you got
[1:03:06] wrong word a word revival see Jesus was
[1:03:11] the word revival he didn't need a
[1:03:14] resurrection
[1:03:16] he was the resurrection but that revival
[1:03:21] came when he brought what he brought us
[1:03:24] the word and it caused a revival because
[1:03:27] that's what that Pentecost lived off of
[1:03:29] that's what the whole Church ages of
[1:03:30] lived off of they've lived off Jesus
[1:03:32] Christ their revival the stirring listen
[1:03:37] because remember and I and I I want to
[1:03:42] say this in all honesty you hear people
[1:03:44] say preachers mostly 90% of them it's
[1:03:47] 99% of them we don't all see eye to eye
[1:03:53] okay did Jesus walk up and say sometimes
[1:03:57] me and my father have a problem
[1:04:00] did he ever did he ever walk up and say
[1:04:04] now I've been fighting it out with my
[1:04:06] daddy back there yeah but let's go a
[1:04:12] little bit further than him I my father
[1:04:13] woman when the bride says I and my
[1:04:17] father are one and these other things
[1:04:20] the show could pull away who the shuk it
[1:04:22] stands there and says well that's your
[1:04:24] idea that's your opinion I don't see it
[1:04:27] that way there's got to be one right
[1:04:34] that's why a word revival is a restoring
[1:04:37] of the word of the son of man I hope you
[1:04:40] see that's what we're coming to the son
[1:04:42] of God down through the church ages you
[1:04:44] could have non quickened word because
[1:04:48] God can't quicken the Father Son Holy
[1:04:49] Ghost baptism but he will allow it
[1:04:52] because of what his children he had
[1:04:54] Rickey's and ricotta's out there and
[1:04:56] calling that system hope you understand
[1:05:00] that he had him out there because Martin
[1:05:05] Luther was a Trinitarian but God said he
[1:05:07] was well pleased to dwell in that guy so
[1:05:10] you got to approach it to where the some
[1:05:12] of those things were what hidden from
[1:05:14] man but today the books open folks
[1:05:19] there's no three different doctrines in
[1:05:21] the message it's one message one
[1:05:25] doctrine one way one truth one life
[1:05:29] other 1 John 17 he said lord I pray that
[1:05:32] they'll be one as you and I are one
[1:05:36] no no don't think we got revivals we
[1:05:39] haven't oh they've got millions and
[1:05:41] millions of church members but not a
[1:05:44] revival no where no no the bride hasn't
[1:05:50] had a revival yet there's been no
[1:05:53] revival there no manifestation of God to
[1:05:55] stir the bride yet now you say well
[1:05:59] there what's that manifestation go back
[1:06:02] to what he said no whooping and
[1:06:04] hollering no signs and wonders you got
[1:06:05] it healing revivals that's not what
[1:06:08] we're talking about here we're talking
[1:06:11] about a manifestation that somebody can
[1:06:13] put the word together and the people can
[1:06:16] receive the word together and there is
[1:06:18] the truth and not a bunch of error
[1:06:22] that's what a word revival is that's
[1:06:25] what this endtime word revival is it's a
[1:06:28] reviving of the son of man ministry
[1:06:32] Jesus Christ so close brother Browne
[1:06:35] said so close to being on the earth but
[1:06:41] he's in his bride
[1:06:43] there's been no revival yet no
[1:06:45] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:06:46] yes see we're looking for it it will
[1:06:49] take those seven unknown thunders back
[1:06:51] there to wake her up again okay that's
[1:06:57] what's gonna wake us up you say well
[1:07:00] what are they there's a revelation
[1:07:02] contained in the seven seals if we
[1:07:03] preach the other day and what brother
[1:07:06] Dale has been preaching for 40 years
[1:07:11] we're gonna get it because God said was
[1:07:15] going to get it we can look all over and
[1:07:19] all the bad and all of this is not in
[1:07:21] the other but somebody's gonna get it
[1:07:24] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:07:27] back there what the complete plan of
[1:07:28] redemption may I say that's the complete
[1:07:31] plan of redemption which is body spirit
[1:07:33] and soul right there's the seven unknown
[1:07:36] thunders back there to wake her up again
[1:07:38] he will send it he promised it and what
[1:07:41] did what your brother brother
[1:07:44] George Quinn say God's word has to come
[1:07:48] to pass he said it and it's gonna have
[1:07:51] to come to pass and we'll leave you with
[1:07:54] this one and then we'll talk about it
[1:07:56] Sunday afternoon this is testimony in
[1:08:00] scene 1964 then we get to begin to find
[1:08:03] out miracles isn't taking place no more
[1:08:06] like they were the sick go home sick it
[1:08:10] isn't because of God it's because of the
[1:08:13] lack of the revival among the people
[1:08:17] there is no revival they sit and listen
[1:08:21] go home and say well I guess that was
[1:08:24] pretty good mm-hmm see there's that
[1:08:26] there is there is not that zeal that's
[1:08:29] what we're gonna talk about Sunday would
[1:08:31] come about zeal there is not that
[1:08:33] something in the people that should be
[1:08:35] there not saying that you nobody's
[1:08:38] Christian he's not be Christianizing
[1:08:39] people there's just something not there
[1:08:42] you know what it is it's the divine word
[1:08:45] being revealed and us what taking it in
[1:08:52] and take your coat off and reaching get
[1:09:00] him by the collar knock him in the floor
[1:09:05] jump on top of him and say how much find
[1:09:08] if I should rain that's pretty harsh
[1:09:15] somebody were to walk by let go I don't
[1:09:18] know about them to people but you know
[1:09:23] Jesus the Prince of Peace stood one day
[1:09:25] and he said I didn't come to bring peace
[1:09:28] he said I came to bring a sword I come
[1:09:32] to bring a division between them people
[1:09:36] out there and the people in here man the
[1:09:40] Prince of Peace he is the Prince of
[1:09:43] Peace yet one day he took and planted a
[1:09:46] rope we were a bystander we would go
[1:09:49] that's a mad Jew
[1:09:54] but what was he doing he was fulfilling
[1:09:57] the word he even even quoted it he said
[1:10:01] you've made my father's house I den of
[1:10:05] thieves he was in the scripture
[1:10:08] so was Paul Cartwright he was in the
[1:10:12] scripture I must fight if I should reign
[1:10:16] that's in the Bible so we got to fight
[1:10:19] this thing we got to fight everything
[1:10:20] that's against we got to fight
[1:10:22] everything that we thought before we got
[1:10:26] a fight that we might reign extend our
[1:10:30] feet we must fight listen when we come
[1:10:38] to the time of the five wise and the
[1:10:41] five foolish virgins both groups were
[1:10:47] asleep both groups were asleep read your
[1:10:52] Bible
[1:10:53] they all woke up but one group realized
[1:11:01] they were missing something and they go
[1:11:06] and look and say we need some oil and
[1:11:08] that group looks at them and says you've
[1:11:12] been in this message 50 years may I
[1:11:15] paraphrase you've been in this message
[1:11:18] 50 years sitting in the message church
[1:11:19] and you still say you said now you tell
[1:11:21] me you ain't got the Holy Ghost well
[1:11:24] that's what the oil is right
[1:11:25] oil is the whole ego well we've already
[1:11:28] used ours up we've done this all these
[1:11:30] excuses you know what the five why's go
[1:11:35] find it yourself
[1:11:36] you've been playing forever how many
[1:11:40] years we have got our oil now you think
[1:11:43] boy that sounds bad that's not a real
[1:11:45] Christian attitude but you know what
[1:11:47] when it comes to life or death you'll do
[1:11:52] everything to stay alive
[1:11:53] those people prepared they got their oil
[1:11:57] they made sure they had the baptism of
[1:11:59] the Holy Ghost even though they might
[1:12:02] have slept but when the cry came out
[1:12:05] they all woke up
[1:12:07] but one went in and one stayed here amen
[1:12:12] we don't want to do that we want to have
[1:12:14] that revival when God wakes us up we
[1:12:17] want to make sure we've got plenty of
[1:12:19] oil for yourself this is a personal you
[1:12:24] say that's so that's so impersonal I
[1:12:28] just read you all these quotes where
[1:12:31] brother Brown said you are the revival
[1:12:33] an individual is a revival not a great
[1:12:37] group you by yourself are a revival in
[1:12:41] yourself but let's make sure we're the
[1:12:44] wise virgins make sure we got oil pray
[1:12:50] to God ask the Lord to give you the
[1:12:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost and even after
[1:12:55] he gives you the baptism of Holy Ghost
[1:12:56] say look God don't put me in the closet
[1:12:59] put me right there and I'm gonna stand
[1:13:03] I'm gonna be here I want you to feed me
[1:13:06] I'm just a baby but I want you to feed
[1:13:09] me I got a big old mouth feed me I may
[1:13:12] cry but please feed me you know if we
[1:13:15] come and humble ourself like that
[1:13:16] instead of looking over everybody else
[1:13:18] and thinking they're the problem no if
[1:13:19] you start telling Jenna today if you
[1:13:21] think somebody else is the problem I'll
[1:13:23] promise you one thing by the Word of God
[1:13:25] you're the problem
[1:13:26] and you're causing this church not to
[1:13:29] have a revival you show now you sense
[1:13:31] the one brother Bram said it starts with
[1:13:33] one and goes to the other well what if
[1:13:34] it stops checking up town folks it's
[1:13:40] time to say it's my fault like brother
[1:13:43] Dale says it's I believe it's my fault
[1:13:46] mm-hmm if there's not a healing that
[1:13:48] walks away from this it's my fault I've
[1:13:51] done something wrong well you gonna
[1:13:53] blame God I better not
[1:13:56] you can't blame God when somebody comes
[1:13:58] here and you open the Bible God's words
[1:13:59] got to come to pass bites dropped your
[1:14:01] heel
[1:14:02] what brother Brent said you ought to
[1:14:04] drive us into desperation when people
[1:14:06] are not healed of what they come up here
[1:14:08] for that's what we should do sign cry
[1:14:11] sign cry listen sign cry for your family
[1:14:14] first your lost loved ones I'm telling
[1:14:17] you right here under my feet there's a
[1:14:21] hug
[1:14:21] there are more names on this you know
[1:14:24] what brother Gary you might have to
[1:14:28] build us another church he puts you on
[1:14:32] the spot
[1:14:33] but really that's a hundred people that
[1:14:36] I'm expecting God to do something to and
[1:14:39] they're not all my flesh and blood but
[1:14:42] I'm telling you your church family is a
[1:14:45] lot closer than your natural family so

[1:15:37] kids wanted in the world do you think

[1:19:07] torment what do you fear ain't nothin to
[1:19:10] fear but fear itself
[1:19:12] wonder what brother Ernie says fear is
[1:19:14] false evidence appearing real
[1:19:16] FPA are false evidence appearing real
[1:19:18] that's what there is what do you God
[1:19:22] always say that's right what's the first
[1:19:24] thing he said when he met Adam fear not
[1:19:26] what's the first thing he said when he
[1:19:28] met disciples fear not
[1:19:30] what's the first thing the angel said to
[1:19:31] brother round fear not all the things
[1:19:34] because he wanted to take away that fear
[1:19:35] sure there's a holy reverence when you
[1:19:37] meet God but there it should take the
[1:19:39] fear away listen Adam had a problem
[1:19:42] conversing with God because of what he
[1:19:45] did but now you and I are supposed to
[1:19:48] come boldly to the throne now who's
[1:19:50] sitting on it
[1:19:52] God Almighty sitting on that throne and
[1:19:54] he said come boldly to the throne you
[1:19:58] know why we don't we have sinned that's
[1:20:02] so easily beset us
[1:20:04] Paul said us run the race with patience
[1:20:06] and that's what God's been he is a
[1:20:08] patient God because look how long he's
[1:20:11] let this thing run but folks is coming
[1:20:15] down to a trying time
[1:20:16] brother Brown said it would be a Razors
[1:20:19] Edge between truth and error razor's
[1:20:23] edge that's pretty that's pretty thin a
[1:20:26] razor's edge but we're anchored in the
[1:20:30] Word of God we're anchored if we stay
[1:20:34] anchored then we'll be fine
[1:20:37] have a good day tomorrow have a good day
[1:20:40] Friday the whole mines are clear we will
[1:20:44] dismiss go with God pray for this

[1:20:53] let's just bow our heads and
[1:20:55] and be dismissed Heavenly Father we
[1:20:59] thank you Lord that you've given us an
[1:21:01] opportunity to talk to the greatest
[1:21:04] people that ever walked on the face of
[1:21:06] this earth the bride of Jesus Christ in
[1:21:09] the end time we're in this building
[1:21:13] someone I believe will stand and say
[1:21:19] death you have nothing in me or for me
[1:21:26] because we stand as Paul Cartwright and
[1:21:29] says I must fight if I sure reign Lord
[1:21:34] this is a battle the greatest battle
[1:21:37] Lord we think of the other day we were
[1:21:41] thinking of the great world wars in the
[1:21:44] wars and campaigns of Napoleon and
[1:21:48] Alexander the Great and then we come up
[1:21:50] to the great Civil War Lord those wars
[1:21:54] are talked about in history they're
[1:21:57] still talked about among people there
[1:21:59] they're ingrained in our history the
[1:22:02] Revolutionary War in world war one world
[1:22:05] war two all these great wars that men
[1:22:08] have fought but this is the greatest
[1:22:12] battle that's ever been fought and
[1:22:15] that's the Battle of the mind between
[1:22:17] God as brother Chris was talking about
[1:22:20] between God and Satan well who stands
[1:22:23] between God and Satan we do and you will
[1:22:28] be victorious because your word said you
[1:22:30] were going to be victorious you will be
[1:22:33] victorious to a bride a little bride
[1:22:36] that's God in human flesh on the face of
[1:22:39] the earth
[1:22:39] Lord we must realize who we are and what

[1:22:47] making it to this part of our life what
[1:22:50] revealed that show each and every one of
[1:22:52] us Lord that we are are we are in that
[1:22:55] vision that we may not realize it at the
[1:22:59] moment but Lord let us have a day of of
[1:23:03] Revelation to where we look down and see
[1:23:06] that we have on the green shirt and that
[1:23:08] we were part
[1:23:09] of that vision and then we know and in
[1:23:12] our heart as brother Bissell said I know
[1:23:15] that vision had to come to pass because
[1:23:18] it didn't it would not fail Lord you'll
[1:23:21] never fail us but we sure will fail you
[1:23:24] but I pray that you'd just forgive us of
[1:23:26] our faults heal the sick
