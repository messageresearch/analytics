[4:43] once again in our midst in Jesus name
[4:46] amen amen amen what a speaker I've
[4:49] never it sounds interesting praise the
[4:53] Lord amen uh want to talk to you a
[4:55] little bit about uh some scriptures
[4:58] let's go in the scripture to uh to St
[5:01] Luke the 16th chapter I mean St Luke the
[5:05] 4th chapter the 16th
[5:07] verse
[5:09] um and uh it's a familiar scripture
[5:12] that's been
[5:15] uh it's been talked about several times
[5:18] as you've as we've been in this
[5:21] message and it's referring to Jesus when
[5:23] he when he read The
[5:25] Scroll of the prophet
[5:28] Isaiah and uh it's uh St Luke
[5:33] 4:16 and it came and he came to Nazareth
[5:38] where he had been brought up and as is
[5:42] as his custom was he went unto the
[5:47] synagogue on the Sabbath on the Sabbath
[5:51] day and stood up to uh for to read stood
[5:56] up for to read and there was
[6:01] and there was delivered unto him the
[6:04] book of the prophet Isaiah and when he
[6:06] had opened the book he found the place
[6:10] where it is written the spirit of the
[6:13] Lord is upon me because he hath anointed
[6:16] me to preach the gospel unto the poor he
[6:20] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[6:23] and to preach the Deliverance to the
[6:27] captive and Rec recovery of sight unto
[6:30] the blind to S set at Liberty them that
[6:33] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[6:37] year of the Lord and Jesus stopped right
[6:40] there and he didn't go on with that
[6:42] scripture he kind of cut it off in half
[6:43] the scripture uh you can look that up
[6:45] the the actual scripture that he was
[6:47] reading is in Isaiah 61 uh
[6:51] 1 and uh so you'll find that uh and I I
[6:55] I marked that also but you'll find that
[6:57] he stopped there because he's because
[6:59] brother Bram explained he stopped there
[7:02] mainly because that next part of that
[7:04] scripture was for the coming to of
[7:07] judgment or the or the or his second
[7:10] coming not his first coming so now you
[7:12] can be seated as
[7:15] we you know uh I was uh listening to to
[7:19] some of the tapes uh where brother Brown
[7:21] was talking about when he was in birth
[7:23] pains and and uh uh you hear him talk uh
[7:27] witness about that a few times times
[7:30] where a priest got up to give him the
[7:32] scroll give him to read out of his Bible
[7:35] because uh brother Brown's Bible had
[7:37] stuck together two pages and uh you find
[7:40] out that uh you know when brother B
[7:42] testifies of of it he often says well
[7:45] exactly what you know he says that the
[7:47] priest told him Stand Fast the the the
[7:50] Lord's about to do something right you
[7:53] know but listening to the tape itself
[7:55] the very words that that priest said was
[7:58] this is God's breath
[8:01] I think it was breath and I'm wasn't
[8:02] sure of that word there is a reason why
[8:05] it is it was done there's a reason why
[8:08] the pages was stuck like that there's a
[8:10] reason why it was done God will show you
[8:14] something to bring out to bring out of
[8:17] this and it's wonderful amen those are
[8:20] the actual words of the priest on the
[8:22] tape right but brother Brown says you
[8:24] know God is fixing to
[8:26] move and uh and and you can see why you
[8:29] know he kind of paraphrased I guess what
[8:31] the priest was actually trying to say
[8:33] but you start to find out that if we
[8:35] look at the scripture and we look at the
[8:37] the way that uh that God's revealing
[8:40] himself and I want to talk a little bit
[8:42] about uh what has been
[8:45] fulfilled what is what what is yet to be
[8:49] fulfilled and what part is the bride
[8:52] playing in the Fulfillment of the
[8:54] scriptures amen and you start to wonder
[8:56] well you know who am i y who who am I uh
[9:00] uh that that I have any part to do in
[9:02] this you know God's way bigger than me
[9:05] he brought forth a message he did a
[9:07] mighty mighty work in our day and age
[9:10] he's manifested himself in our day and
[9:12] hour and he's done some great works and
[9:14] he's actually revealed so much to his
[9:17] bride for this last day but what part do
[9:20] I have to play in this and we'll get to
[9:22] that a little later but watch watch we
[9:25] when we look at the Fulfillment of
[9:28] scriptures we look at the the day and
[9:30] age we live in we we often think well
[9:34] you know A lot's gone by you know A
[9:37] lot's gone by it's just it just rolled
[9:39] on real fast since since brother bam was
[9:42] even here you can't you say well did
[9:45] some people have said has brother did
[9:47] brother brandham actually talk about the
[9:50] attack on the Twin Towers did brother
[9:52] brandham actually you know that's a
[9:54] major event didn't he see it coming and
[9:56] and speak of it in some tape they say
[9:59] well didn't brother bam actually see the
[10:01] crushing of the economy like it's
[10:02] happening today or did he ever see the
[10:05] the the banks falling apart or the or
[10:07] did he see the the the the but you know
[10:11] what let me let you know that there has
[10:15] to be the course of events right that
[10:19] the events that will bring the that
[10:21] bring into position the things that that
[10:23] are to be for example the prophecies
[10:26] brother Brown said the Fulfillment of
[10:28] the word word of God or should he say
[10:31] the the the interpretation of the word
[10:33] of God is for it to come to pass so now
[10:36] how how do we get how was it that that
[10:39] we're going to get uh okay let's go into
[10:41] the Old Testament a little
[10:43] bit how are we going to get
[10:46] Ahab to get killed and his blood run out
[10:49] in the spot where nebot was killed yeah
[10:52] right how are we going to bring the
[10:54] chain of events how are we going to make
[10:56] things happen so that this thing comes
[10:58] to pass
[11:00] so you see what's in God's mind where
[11:03] he's setting everything up he set he's
[11:05] he's setting the stage for every event
[11:08] that's spoken of by the word of God for
[11:11] this hour to come to
[11:14] place how you going to say well there's
[11:16] a persecution how are we going to say
[11:17] that the World Council of churches gets
[11:19] the power to come back and look for you
[11:21] personally as message
[11:23] Believers where are they going to get
[11:25] where why are they singling you out
[11:27] anyway you're good people
[11:29] why would they single you out as good
[11:31] people and say you're doing something
[11:33] illegal you're doing something wrong we
[11:35] must get rid of you we must send you to
[11:38] the concentration camps up there in in
[11:40] Siberia or Alaska or whatever right how
[11:43] can these
[11:45] event even now my mind is almost baffled
[11:49] wondering how could this event or how
[11:52] could this persecution come up come
[11:55] on but then you start to look at how the
[11:58] chain of events starts happening you
[12:00] start to look at what's yet to be
[12:03] fulfilled right you wonder what would
[12:06] the change be when California goes under
[12:09] the sea over there what's going to bring
[12:12] the pressure on when when uh when when
[12:15] you see uh people singling out like the
[12:17] pope Coming to America all right and
[12:20] waving his hand over America and saying
[12:23] I'm sorry the Catholic Church did such
[12:25] horrible things oh yeah and I'm sorry
[12:28] that the that
[12:29] we will make restitutions we got the
[12:31] money we'll pay you
[12:33] guys we'll pay you guys for all the
[12:35] damage we did yeah but I'm really
[12:39] interested in all the
[12:42] denominations that America has to offer
[12:46] I need you know when in in my
[12:47] interpretation he's really thinking
[12:49] about I need to set up an image unto me
[12:52] yeah right in the United States right I
[12:55] need to control this sure this is out of
[12:58] my control and I need to control it
[13:01] right you say that's just be
[13:03] paraphrasing but I could imagine where
[13:06] it's where it's going to where it's
[13:07] coming from I I I I I heard him on his
[13:11] speeches and I heard what he said but I
[13:13] didn't understand why he was so
[13:16] interested in the denominations of this
[13:19] United States absolutely amen why did he
[13:21] have such an interest in it is because
[13:23] he's going to manipulate and there will
[13:26] be an exercise power given because
[13:30] it's already come forth right the
[13:33] message has already told us it's going
[13:35] to go that way right now you wonder
[13:38] where would a bank falling apart or the
[13:41] housing market falling apart or this
[13:43] nation's economy falling apart or go on
[13:46] down to to looking at uh and and it's
[13:49] hitting us as individuals when we start
[13:50] looking for jobs and stuff it it the
[13:53] economy falling apart what does that
[13:55] have to do with the Fulfillment of
[13:56] scripture what does it have to do with
[13:58] the with with the world in and its
[14:00] position it's in right now right we
[14:03] don't we don't know exactly the details
[14:05] of what's going to ma uh make these
[14:08] things Trigger or have come to pass but
[14:11] we do know that we've got the tapes and
[14:14] we can go back and we can see what the
[14:16] prophet of this hour has
[14:19] expressed and it's already been said
[14:22] exactly it will not fall to the ground
[14:25] without being
[14:26] fulfilled in other words uh and and and
[14:29] and you know when when Isaiah said a
[14:31] virgin shall conceive he had no idea
[14:34] right right what he was really saying
[14:37] right if you go into the history they
[14:40] say that there was a prophecy given way
[14:42] before Isaiah said that there will be a
[14:44] virgin that conceived there was people
[14:47] saying amongst the the the uh what do
[14:50] they call those uh the the the worldly
[14:53] or or should I say the the pagans that
[14:56] there will be a virgin that
[14:57] conceived and and when Isaiah said it
[15:00] it's because it was a prophecy coming
[15:02] forth and it had to come to pass Mary
[15:05] had no idea that it was going to be her
[15:08] right right until she stood there in
[15:11] front of the Angel and that angel
[15:12] explained to her that she was the one to
[15:14] fulfill that
[15:17] scripture Y what would be of you if
[15:19] you're going to stand there and and and
[15:21] and the Lord comes to you or or the Lord
[15:23] has through this message is revealing to
[15:26] you what part you're to play come on
[15:29] brother in the Fulfillment of God's word
[15:31] come on I'll tell you there are some
[15:33] things that you've got to do as message
[15:36] Believers you got to have faith to
[15:38] believe that God's word is infallible on
[15:41] you got to have faith to believe that
[15:42] God's word will come to pass I don't
[15:44] care what the circumstances are I don't
[15:47] care what the symptoms are they will
[15:49] come to pass if we stand up and we say
[15:51] we believe that God can heal us we
[15:54] believe he did it for us 2,000 years ago
[15:56] I don't care what the symptom is we have
[15:59] confidence to believe that it will come
[16:01] to pass I don't care how much I hurt I
[16:04] don't care if the Bone's broken I don't
[16:06] care what it is I believe what God Said
[16:09] of it right and that's the that's the
[16:11] truth whether I can put my weight on it
[16:14] or not come on I believe what God Said
[16:16] right now that's where it comes too it
[16:18] comes to a bride that will take him at
[16:20] his word amen no matter what the
[16:23] feelings no matter what the
[16:24] circumstances are no matter what the
[16:26] symptoms are they believe God's word
[16:28] more than the symptom right right amen
[16:30] and they say that this is this is you
[16:32] know brother Brown said one time he said
[16:34] you know uh what what heaven or should I
[16:38] say what's what is in in the faith realm
[16:40] is more real than this realm we're in
[16:43] here so when we stand back and we say we
[16:46] stand and believe that God angels heaven
[16:49] is real when we have faith to believe
[16:53] God's word heaven is real or these
[16:55] things that this message that this that
[16:57] we say this is real this is more real
[17:00] than holding this Pulpit here or or
[17:02] coming to this church or getting in your
[17:04] car it's more real than you're you're
[17:06] getting a getting up to get to work in
[17:08] the morning it's more real than that and
[17:10] you say well how could it be more real
[17:11] than that because it's God's word and
[17:15] heavens and earth will pass away God's
[17:17] word will not pass away what we see here
[17:20] in material is less real than what is
[17:22] what God has promised us amen so how do
[17:25] we stand on his promises because it's
[17:27] real am amen hallelujah amen so here we
[17:31] are when we look at the at at at at
[17:34] what's what's been fulfilled or should
[17:37] when we start looking at the past when
[17:39] we look at we look at at prophecies
[17:41] given for this day and age when we look
[17:43] at the the condition of the world we can
[17:46] see that Sodom gomor has come upon us we
[17:48] can see that the that the that and and
[17:51] you know this thing was just just 30
[17:52] years ago it was in the closet come
[17:54] nobody knew who was a homosexual right
[17:57] now they go on parades right you know uh
[18:01] let me tell you uh Los Angeles has no
[18:03] embarrassment about it come on right
[18:06] Santa New Mexico has no embarrassment
[18:08] about it come on you wonder why why can
[18:11] a whole place be
[18:13] popular they taking something as as as
[18:16] as pristine or as real to us message
[18:19] Believers as a rainbow and they make
[18:21] that their symbol Somewhere Over the
[18:23] Rainbow you know they're going to have
[18:25] their place where it's perfectly all
[18:27] right to be the way they are and they
[18:30] don't realize that judgments hanging
[18:33] over this world just you know like
[18:36] brother Brown said one time he says if
[18:38] if he allows this world to go on the way
[18:41] it's going he to have to raise up Sodor
[18:44] and apologize to it for burning them up
[18:46] for the sins they were doing amen see
[18:49] that's the condition and we're we're
[18:51] that's where we go shopping Santa Fe New
[18:53] Mexico you know and sometimes you could
[18:55] sit there I mean I mean we're in the f
[18:59] care uh set program and they want to
[19:02] raise children too men and men wanting
[19:06] to raise kids women and women wanting to
[19:09] raise kids you wonder why that's right
[19:12] you know what kind of kid would they
[19:14] raise right right you know have two mam
[19:17] or two daddies you know it's kind of
[19:19] strange but that's what they want you
[19:22] know and we wonder we wonder how Sodom s
[19:25] sodomy and all this is coming to the
[19:27] place where it's it's well
[19:30] accepted where even if you start to talk
[19:32] to Brethren they'll say well they are
[19:34] nice people yeah Brethren you talk to
[19:38] Brethren in this message and they'll say
[19:40] Well they're good people they got a good
[19:42] heart yeah but if they don't repent for
[19:45] that lifestyle they've got
[19:47] a judgment hanging over them right amen
[19:51] that's right they may be nice people but
[19:54] nice Don't Make christian that my nice
[19:57] doesn't make don't make bride that's
[20:00] right amen so watch we we look at what
[20:03] what what what was promised for our day
[20:05] and age we look at at at at the the
[20:08] Judgment of Sodom as we as the prophecy
[20:12] that Jesus said as it was in the days of
[20:15] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[20:17] the son of Lord uh son of man now watch
[20:21] this had to come to pass there had to be
[20:24] a Sodom condition Upon This Nation at
[20:28] the time of the revealing of the son of
[20:31] man that's the way the scripture writes
[20:33] it out it says this will be the
[20:35] condition of the world this is when the
[20:37] son of man will will come right right
[20:40] you know we're promised that when Jesus
[20:43] came he came as the son of man right
[20:46] okay he's came he's came as a son of man
[20:48] he'll become he came as a Son of God
[20:51] bless him he's revealing himself when
[20:53] the world gets in that Sodom condition
[20:56] once again as a son of man that's right
[20:58] then to the Jews he'll be revealed as
[21:00] the son of David and to the foolish
[21:02] virgin come on so we during the during
[21:05] the the tribulation period but watch
[21:08] what are we so we see that the that the
[21:11] events the things that are coming on
[21:12] this
[21:13] Earth are already saying it's here amen
[21:17] we're we're we're at his coming right
[21:19] we're at his we're we're at his
[21:21] manifestation we're at is uh the day of
[21:25] the son of man is
[21:27] here as it was in the days of Noah
[21:29] notice how how how how how the Lord said
[21:32] as it was in the days of Noah and then
[21:34] he comes to as it was in the days of the
[21:35] son of man right the days of Noah back
[21:39] in the uhhh brother Bam's years it was
[21:41] just a problem of marriage and divorce
[21:43] men were divorcing everywhere women were
[21:45] divorced everywhere wanting to be
[21:47] deacons and and preachers and all this
[21:49] stuff but nowadays it's come to the
[21:51] Sodom condition notice how it had to
[21:54] come in in in sequence notice how the
[21:56] word of God seems to never make a
[21:59] mistake it comes in its sequence on
[22:02] watch how the word of God manifests
[22:05] itself it's as as destruction is hanging
[22:08] over the Gentiles the revealing of the
[22:11] son of man
[22:12] to a called out people just like it was
[22:15] in Abraham's day a called out people
[22:18] catch the Revelation come on of the
[22:21] message of this hour to bring them to a
[22:24] rapturing faith believe that amen how
[22:26] could we get to a rapturing faith we can
[22:28] hardly get across the common cold you
[22:30] know uh we struggle with uh we struggle
[22:33] with the aches and pains that seem to
[22:35] plague us every day but what what are we
[22:37] doing we're we're we're a people that'll
[22:39] stand forth and say look I believe my
[22:42] faith rather than my aches and pains
[22:44] I'll believe the the the word of God
[22:46] rather than what I'm feeling amen that's
[22:50] right amen re you know and then and then
[22:53] we find that that as the church agents
[22:54] have ran their
[22:56] course and they man ested themselves
[22:59] we've come to the end of the church ages
[23:01] is
[23:02] leoa and leoa is already rubbing itself
[23:05] off on this message you say rubbing it
[23:07] you know I've heard ministers say and I
[23:10] believe somewhat that this message is
[23:13] not leoa Lea was Pentecost right when
[23:17] Pentecost lost the movement of the
[23:20] spirit and they went off to try and
[23:22] become a denomination the Holy Spirit
[23:25] came to move amongst the message
[23:27] Believers and no longer is working with
[23:29] Leo DEA so really the Shu stayed there
[23:33] and the wheat is now in the in the
[23:36] ripening where the sun can hit it and
[23:38] it's pulled away and it's the the
[23:40] wheat's now in the ripening of the sun
[23:42] and the wheat is the Original Seed the
[23:45] faith seat like Abraham's Royal seat
[23:47] that will believe the message of this
[23:49] hour okay I can understand that I can
[23:52] iron to that but you know I'm finding
[23:55] out that look what's happening in Lea
[23:59] it's happening amongst the message
[24:01] anymore you start to find out there's
[24:03] ministers that will will will cut
[24:05] themselves out and say if you don't
[24:07] believe it like I believe it you ain't
[24:10] got you're not part of the Bride you're
[24:11] not part of the
[24:13] Rapture you know one time they told me
[24:16] about the little story about trying to
[24:18] uh I don't know if you guys heard it in
[24:19] Pentecost back in the old days they used
[24:21] to say the the Never Die Doctrine you
[24:23] ever heard of that never die Doctrine
[24:26] they said well if you're going to you
[24:28] know we're so close to the coming of the
[24:30] Lord that we're not going to die anymore
[24:33] come on we're not going to go to the by
[24:35] way of the Grave come on we're going to
[24:38] be the ones that are changed in the
[24:39] moment in the twinkling and eye sound of
[24:41] the last trumpet wow that's a wonderful
[24:44] re I want to be part of that that's
[24:46] right amen I want to be part of I want
[24:47] to be changed I don't want to be I don't
[24:49] want to go to the Grave I want to be
[24:51] changed and they said well you got to
[24:53] believe it you got to have faith in it
[24:56] is all right I'm talking to the brother
[24:58] that are believing this and I says okay
[25:00] Brothers I says uh I said brother bab's
[25:04] in the grave right right well they says
[25:06] well yeah but he's not in this time yeah
[25:10] he's he's going to be raised up don't
[25:11] worry about him you worry about yourself
[25:13] you got to have the faith that you're
[25:15] not going to die okay okay I'll say this
[25:17] and I said well I said the sons of
[25:19] zebedy came up to Jesus mother of the
[25:21] sons of Zeb came to Jesus and said well
[25:24] I want my son to be uh at your right
[25:26] hand this other son to be at your left
[25:27] hand
[25:29] and Jesus says woman you don't know what
[25:30] you're asking come on brother she says
[25:32] well he says uh she says then he then
[25:36] Jesus says says to him are you able to
[25:38] drink of the cup that I'm to drink of he
[25:41] says yes we are able and he says and you
[25:43] are able right he knew it you are able
[25:46] to drink of the cup that I'm to drink he
[25:49] says but to sit at my right hand and my
[25:51] left hand it's not mine to give he says
[25:54] it's what it's already appointed to
[25:56] somebody for right
[25:59] then I says to my brother that was
[26:00] telling me about this Doctrine I says
[26:02] you know what I says there is a people
[26:04] that will be a rapturing people come on
[26:07] brother and there is a people that will
[26:08] be a resurrecting people right I says
[26:11] for me to call out and say I'm he isn't
[26:15] up to me I says it's Destiny it's
[26:18] destinated by God already who's going to
[26:21] be there as that come on I says I'd be
[26:24] privileged if I am one of the ones that
[26:25] raptured and I'd be privileged if I'm
[26:27] one of the ones that resurrect it's no
[26:29] difference to me what is the difference
[26:32] to me it's just for you to come up and
[26:34] tell me that I'm not part of the Bride
[26:37] because I don't believe it that way
[26:39] that's not right I says you got to back
[26:41] up and repent I says I'll be there
[26:44] whether you believe me to be there or
[26:46] not because I believe God's word and
[26:48] that's what's solid for me so you see
[26:52] when you but they want to cut you
[26:55] out when they have no right to cut you
[26:57] out right you know they want to cut you
[27:00] out and say if you don't believe the
[27:01] doctrines the way I believe it if you
[27:04] don't believe the the two Souls you're
[27:06] not part of it if you don't believe the
[27:10] back in Mexico there's some that
[27:11] believed that there was a certain
[27:13] brother that was Jesus Christ again and
[27:16] they're marching down the streets of
[27:18] Mexico saying Blessed Be he who comes to
[27:20] the name of the Lord if you don't
[27:21] believe him you're not part of it come
[27:24] on
[27:26] now you know what became them you don't
[27:29] hear about them no more you know and
[27:31] What Becomes of all these doctrines just
[27:35] like the one that Jesus that that that
[27:37] brought up a 40 and went up to the
[27:39] Wilderness that's right yep forerunning
[27:42] the name Jesus you realize that the
[27:45] devil seemed to forrun the
[27:47] name the name of that that's above all
[27:50] names he was forerunning it with a
[27:52] renegade come on right you know that got
[27:55] killed out there right so what is it
[27:58] seems like the devil already wants to
[28:00] forerun the events that this bride is
[28:04] inherit or going to be it's going to be
[28:06] the bride's inheritance so what is it
[28:09] what is what are we looking at
[28:11] fulfillment fulfillment we know we're in
[28:13] the days of Sodom we know we've already
[28:15] come to the place where this bride is
[28:18] catching a revelation of who she is what
[28:20] she's doing how what her what her part
[28:22] is to play now we come at the
[28:25] restoration of the brid tree looking at
[28:26] the adoption or the or the or the or the
[28:29] or even when we start looking at the at
[28:31] the at the Revelation that God gave to
[28:33] us when he brought forth the seals we
[28:35] start to look at the at the at the at
[28:37] the what the message is bringing
[28:39] bringing as we start to see the the the
[28:41] the the truth of God's word being opened
[28:44] up to his bride right and the faith seed
[28:47] that was originally given to the Saints
[28:49] of old which would stand there and
[28:52] believe God and pray for each other and
[28:55] have the faith to while even when Peter
[28:58] was in jail that's right okay going to
[29:00] be beheaded in the morning when a prayer
[29:02] meeting could change the situation and
[29:05] bring God on the seene and get Peter out
[29:07] of jail it's the same kind of thing that
[29:09] happens amongst the bride if she's able
[29:11] to have faith and believe and get to God
[29:13] In Prayer
[29:15] amen we realize the politics is rotten I
[29:19] mean we run politics to try and get a
[29:21] better situation in healthc care and my
[29:24] health care is going up and there went
[29:26] my rais if I got a raise which very
[29:28] little anyway so we wonder why why it
[29:32] doesn't seem like we ever get ahead it's
[29:33] because it's because politics is rotten
[29:36] we can't depend on it you know why would
[29:38] we cry out to when when when Katrina
[29:41] happened Bush save us why don't they cry
[29:45] out to Jesus to save them that's right
[29:47] bush has no salvation power and neither
[29:50] does does Obama or anybody else we got
[29:52] to look towards the the politics is
[29:54] rotten the economy's falling apart the
[29:56] nations are falling apart the job
[29:58] situations fall apart all to bring
[30:01] forth thus sayith the Lord in this day
[30:04] and age to bring the bride into position
[30:08] to be
[30:09] that Original Seed right the faith that
[30:12] was once delivered to the Saint is
[30:14] promised to the bride the bride tree
[30:17] amen the restoration of the Bride tree
[30:19] it's upon us and we got to just like I
[30:22] like like like uh uh what was his name
[30:26] uh bless him
[30:30] father excuse me he's a he's very a
[30:34] Jeremiah just like Jeremiah when he
[30:36] stood there and he read the books of the
[30:38] Prophet Daniel and he saw that hey in in
[30:42] so many years we'll be leaving this
[30:43] place we'll be living Babylon and I want
[30:46] to be ready so he goes into prayer and
[30:48] he says what's to become of my people
[30:51] and God sends an angel of God to reveal
[30:54] to him what's to become of his people
[30:56] and we get the whole scripture Daniel 70
[30:58] weeks because God heard the prayers of a
[31:02] man that knew their desperation set upon
[31:04] him to set up and say look I know we're
[31:07] close to the coming of the Lord and I'm
[31:09] not ready and I'm not right and I got to
[31:11] get ready and I got to pray and I got to
[31:13] ask God and I got to have something God
[31:16] has to move on me personally God has to
[31:18] show me what I got to do right am mean
[31:21] you say well we're going to depend on
[31:23] brother Dale he's going to get us
[31:24] through we're going to depend on the
[31:26] brothers to get us through if we can we
[31:28] got to get start depending on thus sayth
[31:30] the Lord and God's revelation to come to
[31:33] you personally it's got to be a an
[31:35] individual Revelation that God's
[31:37] revealing to you what kind of spirit you
[31:40] should have what kind of time you should
[31:42] spend in what kind of of of of life you
[31:45] should be living amen just the basic
[31:48] things that God revealed to us you know
[31:50] I preached a sermon just the other day
[31:52] and it really struck
[31:54] me blessing it was the accursed things
[31:58] you say the accursed things where'd that
[32:00] come out of it was the accursed things
[32:02] that Joshua's Men that that Ain it's

[32:27] things brother Brandon preached about
[32:30] and they calling them are they the
[32:32] accursed things that would cause the
[32:34] whole church to crumble or how cause the
[32:36] whole church to have sin and then God
[32:39] won't won won't won't move because
[32:41] there's we've got a cursed things
