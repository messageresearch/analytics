[0:05] so I'm filling in again up here for
[0:06] brother Bob today and uh just be in
[0:08] prayer for them
[0:17] traveling
[0:20] okay all right and I just want to give a
[0:24] quick little review of my last lesson it
[0:26] was uh
[0:27] about uh love lesson number eight I
[0:29] believe was and that one was about daily
[0:32] bread uh just a broad overview because I
[0:35] know I might have lost everybody in
[0:36] those examples first I want to say I
[0:37] wasn't bragging about driving so many
[0:39] miles and so much money that have made
[0:41] at philadel anything like that all I was
[0:43] simply saying is when you do something
[0:46] that's kind of big a big daunting task
[0:48] you know if you just uh approach it from
[0:51] just a daily bread just a a little bit
[0:54] of a a day a little bit each day and the
[0:56] word of God is no different if you just
[0:58] approach this V thing of this word of
[1:01] God and the message the Bible so much uh
[1:03] reading material and things that we have
[1:05] and sermons and sermons to listen to but
[1:07] if you just do a little every day that
[1:09] was my whole point in that lesson if you
[1:11] missed anything what I said got caught
[1:13] up in those little examples I gave just
[1:16] that's all I'm asking just a little bit
[1:18] every day and that won't be so
[1:19] overwhelming take it one day at a
[1:22] time also I made the comment that Gabby
[1:24] and I are an anomaly what I was really
[1:27] meaning by that I'm not saying we're
[1:28] something special it's just that we we
[1:30] were on this course in life she was in
[1:32] foster care in all kind of different
[1:33] churches long ways away from the message
[1:36] I was born and raised Baptist going down
[1:38] this course of Life long ways away from
[1:40] the message but the predestinated plan
[1:41] of God intercepted our paths and brought
[1:44] us here but I'm not belittling those who
[1:46] were raised in the message and saying
[1:48] that your life is any less of a paradox
[1:49] or an anomaly when you come to Christ
[1:52] and you're not writing pastor's coattail
[1:55] anymore or parents coattail and you get
[1:57] a revelation for yourself you're just as
[1:59] much of an anomaly you're something that
[2:01] you're a you're a paradox if I can use a
[2:04] word of brother bham that you're going
[2:07] along this course in life right in
[2:08] pastor's coattail then one day the Lord
[2:10] turns to you and calls you by name and
[2:13] says who do you say I the son of man am
[2:15] so even raising the message you still
[2:17] have that have to have that experience
[2:18] and I know y'all have many of y'all have
[2:21] so I wasn't trying to belittle anybody I
[2:23] was just using that an example just
[2:25] shows to me the predestinated plan of
[2:27] God that it wasn't me or you that came
[2:29] here predestinate eternally it was the
[2:31] word of God that you desire now that you
[2:34] didn't desire at one time and it crossed
[2:36] your path and then you begin to uh be
[2:39] attracted to that
[2:41] amen
[2:43] so that was a review of last lesson this
[2:46] is a love lesson number nine part nine
[2:49] the Divine
[2:51] Romance so when reading a story
[2:54] sometimes it's uh let me go ahead and
[2:56] pray over this lesson I didn't prayed
[2:57] yet Heavenly Father pray just bless this
[2:58] little lesson let it be a bless blessing
[3:00] to your people here today Lord and those
[3:01] that hear it on the internet and just
[3:03] help us all in our walk with you Lord to
[3:04] be encouraged in this and just to take
[3:06] it to heart and just to walk a closer
[3:08] walk with you and fall in love with you
[3:10] that's what we want to do in Jesus name
[3:12] amen so when reading a love a story just
[3:15] in general a story sometimes it's good
[3:18] to sort of zoom out and look at the
[3:20] broad picture you can get caught up in
[3:22] all these little details so to see this
[3:24] Divine Romance go back to the beginning
[3:27] in God's mind look to the end and see
[3:29] the redeemed manifested bride behold the
[3:31] Lamb's wife and you can see this whole
[3:34] entire great big picture of a beautiful
[3:36] love story the most beautiful story
[3:38] that's ever been
[3:40] written Revelation 21 and there came
[3:43] unto me one of the Seven Angels which
[3:44] had the seven vs full of the seven last
[3:46] plagues and talked with me saying come
[3:48] hither and I will show Thee the bride
[3:50] the Lamb's
[3:52] wife I believe it was brother Wade that
[3:54] mentioned this book a long time ago I
[3:55] don't remember maybe several months or a
[3:57] year ago and gabin and I bought this
[4:00] book uh at the recommendation of brother
[4:01] Wade or whoever said it I can't remember
[4:03] the Divine Romance what brother Wade by
[4:05] Jee Edwards I highly recommend that
[4:07] getting that book um it's one of my
[4:09] favorite books now and in that uh the
[4:13] author Jean Edwards he simply taken this
[4:17] whole like I just said this whole
[4:19] overview of this great love story from
[4:21] an angel's perspective because angels
[4:23] have been there pretty much the whole
[4:24] time you know viewing all this that's
[4:26] happening there are these bystanders and
[4:28] they bystanders watching this whole
[4:30] thing beh and beholding the whole
[4:32] picture and from their perspective what
[4:34] must they have seen and it's just kind
[4:36] of a narrative of behind the scenes
[4:38] about this great love story between
[4:39] Christ and the bride and I absolutely
[4:42] love it and several times in the book I
[4:43] would stop look back at the the author
[4:46] and say is this a message believer I
[4:48] mean because it's just so there's so
[4:50] much uh in there so much I guess you say
[4:53] Revelation so it's so rich I just don't
[4:56] know how uh a nominal Christian could
[4:58] have gotten so much but just goes to
[5:00] show you he's there too you know dealing
[5:02] with people even in nominal churches cuz
[5:04] they they get see a lot of things too so
[5:08] um so romance means uh a feeling of
[5:11] excitement and mystery associated with
[5:14] love I'm going to pause there for a
[5:16] minute because while I'm teaching this
[5:19] lesson there's there's two sides to all
[5:21] these love lessons it's you and your
[5:22] spouse those of you who are married but
[5:25] then it's also us and our Lord the bride
[5:27] and bridegroom uh the body of Christ in
[5:31] Christ there's this feeling of
[5:33] excitement and mystery associated with
[5:35] love and all I want to say is an as an
[5:39] encouragement uh you who are married
[5:41] keep that alive don't ever let that
[5:43] romance die never it really is alive and
[5:46] and burning strong and passionately at
[5:48] the beginning when two people meet and
[5:50] fall in love but you can keep it going
[5:52] it absolutely doesn't have to stop after
[5:54] 20 30 years of marriage it can keep on
[5:57] going so that's a a excitement and a
[5:59] mystery a and a feeling of love for or a
[6:03] strong attraction toward another person
[6:05] and the courtship behaviors undertaken
[6:07] by an individual to impress Express
[6:09] those overall feelings and resultant
[6:14] emotions uh feeling or action that
[6:16] expresses a romantic or love like
[6:18] attraction between two people it can
[6:20] also refer to the courtship behaviors
[6:22] that people use to express their
[6:23] feelings romance can begin as an
[6:26] infatuation that deepens as people get
[6:30] to know each other I say it should
[6:34] definitely not just can it should begin
[6:37] as that and deepen as you get to know
[6:39] each other more that should intensify
[6:42] that romance should not only perpetuate
[6:45] it should actually get greater over time
[6:47] romance has been the subject of many
[6:49] creative Endeavors including art music
[6:51] plays songs and books how about the word
[6:53] of God you know that's in this inspired
[6:57] by this romance between Christ and the
[6:59] bride that's his love letter to us
[7:02] inspired love
[7:04] letter
[7:06] so another thing I want to say about
[7:08] that going back to that before I go to
[7:09] the next slide here we're wired that way
[7:11] our creator wired us this way you know
[7:14] to have deeper and deeper love for
[7:16] something mostly for him but you can
[7:19] apply that in marriage too use that to
[7:20] your advantage in your marriage and say
[7:22] that we're wired in such a way to where
[7:25] we more the more we get to know each
[7:27] other and think about how much we
[7:28] appreciate one another as husband and
[7:30] wife the more we'll fall in love and
[7:32] have this infatuation and this romance
[7:35] that gets greater and not
[7:38] weaker so elements of romance this is
[7:41] not an all-inclusive list this is just
[7:44] just random things I listed here there's
[7:46] I'm sure you could name more things to
[7:48] add to this list but all I'm trying to
[7:50] do is show you the evidence of this
[7:52] romance that's been going on and
[7:54] throughout the whole lesson kind of
[7:55] meditate on these things as I bring out
[7:58] the examples of them so there's uh first
[8:00] of all there's a longing for a companion
[8:03] okay at the start or even before the
[8:05] beginning of a romance before the two
[8:06] meet there's this longing for a
[8:08] companion so like yeah say you and your
[8:10] spouse before you met each other you men
[8:12] had a longing for a wife and the women
[8:15] had a longing for a husband and to start
[8:16] a family and all that that was their
[8:18] first you know and Christ in his mind
[8:21] had this Longing To to have fellowship
[8:24] and have a bride and be um you know be
[8:27] manifested in this bride and then
[8:29] there's the first meeting there's an
[8:30] attraction there's a falling in love
[8:32] courtship and communion a proposal an
[8:35] engagement a wedding a new home I know
[8:39] it's really small writing but intim
[8:41] intimacy and there's a
[8:44] union um I wasn't ready to go on think
[8:48] of your journey all right now go back in
[8:50] your mind you who are born again you can
[8:53] go all the way back to even your
[8:54] childhood your first conscious memories
[8:58] when you were in your maybe toddler age
[9:00] even think of the first time that God
[9:02] began dealing with you however he did it
[9:04] and whoever he did it through and think
[9:06] of that being that God was beginning to
[9:08] woo and coup if you want to say it like
[9:11] that brooding over your life calling to
[9:13] you from a very young age and just for
[9:15] an example it was for me my parents
[9:17] raised me in church but my grandma my
[9:19] dad's mom in particular she was the one
[9:23] that set this example by reading the
[9:25] Bible and praying with me as a little
[9:26] bitty boy when I'd stay with her
[9:28] sometimes me and my sister and she would
[9:30] get down this old woman when I was 4
[9:33] years old she was about maybe 60 so that
[9:36] was old to me I thought wow how
[9:38] impressive this elderly woman getting
[9:41] down so sincere and praying on her knees
[9:44] in front of me and my sister and reading
[9:47] the Bible to us and letting us pick
[9:49] stories out of the Bible for her to read
[9:50] to us that was God and my grandma cooing
[9:53] to me beginning to woo me and that would
[9:55] come back when I was 15 and I started
[9:58] reading the Bible and praying every day
[9:59] well see that was God beginning to deal
[10:00] with me there with what I would need
[10:02] later in life to be one of the best
[10:04] things that's ever happened to me as
[10:06] daily Bible reading and prayer so think
[10:08] when you were a little child and you
[10:10] think well maybe it was a Sunday school
[10:11] teacher a school teacher could have been
[10:13] your parents could have been a relative
[10:14] of any sort that began dealing with you
[10:17] from a very young age that was this God
[10:20] in the starting this love story
[10:22] beginning to infiltrate your life and
[10:24] calling to
[10:26] you how and when did you fall in love
[10:29] with with him this is where brother
[10:30] Louis's lesson last Sunday and his
[10:33] sermon Wednesday was so profound to me
[10:36] because in all my years of being in uh
[10:39] in church and reading the Bible never
[10:42] I've always I've heard about law and
[10:43] Grace and all that and never seen Grace
[10:46] quite like he brought it out in Mercy
[10:48] that when God forgives you it causes you
[10:50] to fall in love with him how can you not
[10:53] when you get forgiveness versus just law
[10:55] saying Thou shalt not Thou shalt not you
[10:57] say all right I'll try I'll try to be
[10:59] good try to follow the rules but then
[11:01] when he forgives you of what you did you
[11:05] can't help but fall in love with him
[11:07] that's part of this whole love story
[11:09] that was so profound I've never seen it
[11:11] that
[11:12] way
[11:13] so the love letter is of course the
[11:17] Bible um these are some of the elements
[11:19] involved there's the there's the word of
[11:21] God the Love Letter there's the bride
[11:22] and groom in this great story there's
[11:24] the future home there's so many gifts
[11:27] especially Christ himself is God's gift
[11:30] to us brother B said and then we are
[11:34] God's gift to Christ love gifts we'll
[11:36] get into that here in a minute even our
[11:38] Natural Body and our Natural Life are
[11:40] God's gifts to us you know even our
[11:42] natural breath we take I mean think
[11:44] about the human body how fascinating is
[11:46] it's a self-healing body and it needs
[11:48] help from medicine and doctors sometimes
[11:50] but by and large most of what you come
[11:52] down with the body heals itself God made
[11:54] a self-healing body think of all the
[11:57] things the love gifts he's given us
[12:00] how could you not fall in love with him
[12:03] from the Rapture brother B said just
[12:05] reading the Highlight now you can
[12:07] fellowship with him that's what he
[12:11] wants he's longing for Fellowship to be
[12:14] worshiped if your life always was an
[12:17] attribute of God and you're just a mimic
[12:19] of Christianity there'll be millions and
[12:20] billions of them they'll just be mimics
[12:22] of Christianity but talking about this
[12:24] all these instances it shows brother bam
[12:26] saying that God wanted Fellowship
[12:29] it was there and we had a longing for
[12:31] something that was there so we're going
[12:33] back to that last one of those slides
[12:35] where I said there's a longing for a
[12:38] companion to start with there's that
[12:39] longing impression of Christianity
[12:41] brother Banner said holy spirit CS to
[12:43] you and says sinner your God's love gift
[12:46] I want to make love to you won't you do
[12:49] it why don't you just open your heart
[12:51] and say Yes Holy Ghost here I am I'm
[12:53] here I am I don't care what anyone says
[12:55] holy spirit I want you I want you you're
[12:58] the one I'm looking for so on both sides
[13:00] there's this
[13:01] longing skip on down to the yellow and
[13:03] God sent his big bulldozer down out of
[13:05] heaven and he cleansed the old alley out
[13:07] yes sir the old Shackled the Shacks gone
[13:10] the tin cans are gone the rubbish is
[13:12] gone talking about sanctification now
[13:14] it's all pushed out into the sea of
[13:16] forgetfulness and he tears it off there
[13:19] it is forgiveness and you will fall in
[13:21] love with him as a little boy 12 years
[13:23] old neighbor boy introduced me to
[13:25] pornography one of the worst things ever
[13:27] happened to me in life and that's what
[13:29] caused me to realize I was a sinner and
[13:30] needed salvation CU I thought before
[13:32] then I was pretty good kids at school
[13:34] would say you know Ryan you never get in
[13:36] trouble you're always getting bragged on
[13:37] by the teachers and I thought maybe
[13:38] they're right maybe I'm pretty good not
[13:41] neighbor boy brought over porn magazine
[13:42] solve that problem I realized yeah I
[13:44] need salvation so something me started
[13:46] yearning I cried and asked God to
[13:47] forgive me then I started to fall in
[13:50] love but then I I had this root of evil
[13:52] in me for several years three more years
[13:54] after that that I struggled with
[13:55] pornography 13 14 15 years old I didn't
[13:59] know about sanctification it was two
[14:00] more years till I came in the message so
[14:02] what happened in that time I started
[14:04] reading the Bible 15 years old started
[14:06] reading the Bible every day it it lasted
[14:08] a few more months maybe six more months
[14:10] and pornography was gone for my life
[14:12] forever 25 years now it's been gone dead
[14:16] dumb devil gone well sanctification
[14:20] started taking place the washing of
[14:21] Water by the word how could I not love
[14:24] him all those years when I struggled and
[14:26] I said God I want to get rid of this
[14:27] thing I love you and I hate
[14:29] that I'm giving you cause for being on
[14:31] Calvary and I'm hurting you Lord that
[14:34] Ling me was drawing me for a higher for
[14:37] sanctification that I didn't even know
[14:38] existed I I prayed I said Lord can you
[14:40] take it away is that even a thing can
[14:41] you even do that I didn't even know
[14:43] there was sanctification can you Lord is
[14:45] that even possible should I be asking
[14:47] that can you take it away from me and
[14:49] profanity using C words I said Lord I
[14:52] don't want to it's hurting you can you
[14:54] take it away he said yes you read the
[14:57] Bible read the word and I and I didn't
[14:59] even know when I started reading that
[15:01] those things were starting to fall off I
[15:02] didn't know that that would happen I
[15:04] read the Bible cuz I wanted to know him
[15:06] I read the Bible because I didn't want
[15:07] to be a hypocrite I had that and still
[15:10] have that thought that if you claim to
[15:12] be a Christian but you don't read the
[15:13] Bible you're a hypocrite that's that's
[15:15] still my conviction to this day if
[15:17] you're going to profess to be a
[15:18] Christian you should read the Bible you
[15:19] should know what the Bible says you know
[15:21] and I still stand by that I don't mean
[15:23] to hurt any feelings but I'm just saying
[15:25] you know Christians read the Bible Well
[15:28] that started happen happening but it was
[15:30] that love that started when he said I
[15:31] forgive you and I said what I still
[15:34] can't get rid of it and he said and I'd
[15:36] ask for forgiveness again and pray the
[15:38] sinner's prayer again he said I forgive
[15:39] you how could you not love him after
[15:43] that who is this MZ that God came down
[15:45] and became flesh and died the death in
[15:48] Christ so that he could clean the church
[15:51] in order to get it into Fellowship um
[15:53] God God loves Fellowship that's what he
[15:55] made the man for the first time was for
[15:57] Fellowship
[16:00] so the attraction this is again some of
[16:03] the elements here of the romance that
[16:06] we're talking about this great romance 1
[16:08] John 4 you know is all about love love
[16:11] comes from God for God is love or the
[16:13] for love is of God and everyone that
[16:15] loveth is born of God and knoweth God he
[16:17] that loveth not knoweth not know knoweth
[16:20] not God for God is love skip on down
[16:22] verse 10 here in his love not that we
[16:24] love God but that he loved us and sent
[16:26] his son to be the perpetuation for our
[16:28] sins and if we love one another God
[16:31] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[16:32] in us still 1 John 4 God is love and he
[16:37] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[16:39] and God in him we love him because he
[16:42] first loved
[16:43] us so still on the attraction tell me
[16:48] therefore let's back up this is Luke 7
[16:51] Jesus is talking to Simon he invited him
[16:53] over you know to his house and said I've
[16:54] some much saying to the Simon he said
[16:56] Master Sean there was a certain creditor
[16:58] which had two debtors the one owed 500 p
[17:00] and the other 50 and when they had
[17:03] nothing to pay he frankly forgave them
[17:04] both tell me therefore which of them
[17:06] will love him most remember talking
[17:08] about forgiveness causing love Simon
[17:11] answered and said I suppose he to whom
[17:14] he forgave the most and he said unto him
[17:15] thou Hast rightly judged then he talking
[17:17] about the woman washing his feet with
[17:18] her tears kissing his feet she'd been
[17:20] forgiven she loved him so much cuz she
[17:22] had been forgiven for so much she was
[17:25] such a sinner like I was with that
[17:27] pornography such a dirty and he said I
[17:29] forgive you wherefore I say unto thee
[17:32] her sins which are many are forgiven for
[17:35] she loved much but to whom little Is
[17:37] Forgiven the same loveth
[17:40] little now we get into these gifts I
[17:43] didn't mention that in that list but
[17:45] there are gifts involved um when two
[17:48] people fall in love I I showered Gabby
[17:50] with gifts uh when we began to fall in
[17:52] love and and um so it's a common thing
[17:56] you know that you want to give to the
[17:57] one you're in love with invisible Union
[17:59] of the bride of Christ you are wearing
[18:01] the wedding band of predestinated
[18:03] unmerited Grace the wedding band of
[18:05] Grace unmerited of your own so just get
[18:10] that image in your mind of these gifts
[18:12] that God gave us there are so many
[18:19] gifts all right what a privilege to even
[18:23] be considered to be the bride of Christ
[18:26] it's the highest calling to mankind to
[18:27] be the bride of Christ Christ manifested
[18:29] in the form of his bride we just have to
[18:31] attach ourselves to him by the new birth
[18:34] reading the love letter so the Third
[18:36] Exodus when the church can get in such
[18:39] harmony with God until the manifestation
[18:40] of the bridegroom is manifested in the
[18:42] bride because they're going to be one
[18:45] that goes back to my list there talking
[18:47] about the romance and how Two Become One
[18:50] ultimately in unity love gifts greater
[18:54] than pmon here Jesus was God's greatest
[18:56] gift Jesus was God's loved gift to the
[18:59] church and the church is God's love gift
[19:03] to Jesus think of all the gifts that we
[19:06] have from God life itself natural life
[19:08] and and eternal life healing salvation
[19:11] Comfort anything and everything you
[19:13] think of we need is summed up in Christ
[19:15] God's gift to the church the bride in
[19:18] this great romance is Christ and it's
[19:21] even more profound and mindboggling to
[19:22] think that we're his gift you know when
[19:24] Gabby and I got married I didn't really
[19:26] care for any gifts from her she was my
[19:28] gift you know I still like to shower her
[19:30] with gifts but I don't care she does
[19:32] give me gifts you know from time to time
[19:33] I don't care if she does or not she is
[19:35] my
[19:36] gift with a from Serv we see Jesus with
[19:40] a broken heart come around the altar
[19:42] weeping what are you you are God
[19:44] almighty God you are his love gift that
[19:46] he has chosen you and given you to Jesus
[19:52] Christ so love gifts this is Romans 8
[19:55] for I reckon the suffering in this
[19:56] present time not worthy to be compared
[19:57] with the glory which will be revealed in
[19:59] us so much that God wants to reveal in
[20:01] us what a gift that is to Jehovah jar
[20:05] number one brother benam uh quoted this
[20:07] last time like said when I filled the
[20:09] Holy Ghost like you people did I walk
[20:10] through like a big arcade everything
[20:12] there belongs to me so many gifts I'm an
[20:15] heir of every bit of it I'm an heir of
[20:17] an arcade I like to find out what I got
[20:19] when I become a Christian I wanted to
[20:21] know what I own so if I had an arcade
[20:23] I'd go through there and pull out the
[20:24] drawers and look over here and see
[20:26] what's over there something seem to be a
[20:27] little up high get me a step ladder and
[20:29] climb up to it i' find out what it was
[20:31] something seems beyond my reach I get on
[20:33] my knees and start praying and rise up
[20:34] to it it belongs to me God promised it
[20:37] Divine Healing the power of God all the
[20:39] miracles signs wonders love gifts belong
[20:42] to us I mentioned this last time I
[20:44] didn't read them all but um all the
[20:45] Mysteries they're being revealed in our
[20:47] time they're here ready to be delved
[20:50] into if we'll just study and pray and
[20:51] ask God to reveal them Mysteries of the
[20:53] Kingdom of Heaven of Israel's blindness
[20:55] of the end the translation of living
[20:57] Saints at the end of this age New
[20:59] Testament Church is one body composed of
[21:01] Jew and Gentile the church as the bride
[21:04] of Christ the in living Christ God even
[21:06] Christ the Incarnate fullness of the
[21:08] godhe had embodied The Mystery of the
[21:10] processes by which God likeness is
[21:13] restored to man The Mystery of iniquity
[21:15] and of the Seven Stars and the Babylon
[21:18] so many gifts of these Mysteries he
[21:21] saved for our day to reveal to
[21:23] us love GI is where the spirit said pick
[21:25] up the pen and write spoken words is the
[21:27] Original Seed from a little group of the
[21:30] true seed of the word God will present
[21:32] Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin
[21:35] of his word and through them and by them
[21:38] will be fulfilled all that has been
[21:39] promised for his word and the Virgin who
[21:42] knows no man-made Creeds or
[21:47] dogmas Divine so now we're talking about
[21:49] the future home you know when you when a
[21:51] couple is to fall in love and get
[21:53] married they've got to have a place to
[21:54] live well here comes that we know about
[21:56] the future home brother Brandon preached
[21:58] the Divine architect has designed a new
[22:00] city where he will live with his bride
[22:03] just to her touch a Divine architect has
[22:05] designed it for a Divine attribute
[22:07] that's been divinely predestinated by
[22:09] Divine God who is the author of a Divine
[22:12] Divine Life and what will that City look
[22:14] like think of it the impersonation of
[22:16] Christianity brother Ben said he built a
[22:18] great modern new home he's been brooding
[22:20] there beautiful lilies come up in the
[22:22] yard around
[22:23] there as skip on down to the other
[22:25] highlight as the Holy Spirit Broods he
[22:28] will bring forth love joy peace
[22:30] longsuffering goodness gness patience
[22:32] he'll decorate his house
[22:35] upright so Romans 5 for when we were yet
[22:39] without Strength In Due Time Christ died
[22:41] for the ungodly for scarcely for
[22:43] righteous man will one die yet
[22:44] prevention for a good man some would
[22:46] even dare to die but God commendeth or
[22:48] demonstrates his love for us in that
[22:51] while we're yet sinners Christ died for
[22:56] us um in Luke 4 uh this is where
[23:00] um basically I was just going to say in
[23:02] this slide that Christ left something
[23:04] for the church you know we're because
[23:06] we're uh part of him being manifested in
[23:08] the last day we're Christ in you know
[23:10] being manifested in the last day so in
[23:12] the temple he went in the spirit of the
[23:14] Lord he quoted the scripture and read
[23:16] the scripture of the scroll um the
[23:18] spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[23:19] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[23:21] the poor and sent me to heal the
[23:22] brokenhearted to the um to preach
[23:25] Deliverance to the captives recovering
[23:26] of sight to the blind that Liberty them
[23:28] the bruised to preach accept we year of
[23:30] the Lord and then he closed the book and
[23:32] remember he stopped there but the rest
[23:34] of that back in Isaiah 61 is and the day
[23:38] of Vengeance to our god to comfort all
[23:39] that mourn to appoint them that mourn in
[23:41] Zion to give to them Beauty for Ashes
[23:43] and the joy for mourning and the Garment
[23:45] of Praise for the spirit of heaviness so
[23:48] he stopped he fulfilled his part and
[23:49] left part to be fulfilled in the
[23:52] bride um I guess I'll go ahead and let
[23:54] the musicians come at this time if you
[23:56] don't mind I'm going to quote this from
[23:58] Brother Wade this is a pretty long oh
[24:00] sorry brother Wade brother Aaron this is
[24:02] brother Aaron a few couple I think it
[24:04] was uh couple months ago yeah June 12th
[24:08] the old things have passed away when
[24:09] we're talking about that divine order he
[24:10] was preaching about the divine order and
[24:13] we're still staying on the subject of
[24:15] you know passion and uh talking about
[24:17] the um romance so the old things have
[24:21] passed away so when you come into Christ
[24:22] you're under that because the promise is
[24:24] when you come into Christ you enter in
[24:26] that rest you know God come into that
[24:28] and he had a plan and a purpose
[24:30] everything was in divine order and when
[24:32] he came in then he sat down and rested
[24:34] because everything was working just the
[24:36] way God wanted it well then let me tell
[24:38] you something brother and sister we step
[24:39] into that same place where the we step
[24:41] into the divine order the same way when
[24:43] you come to Christ you're in divine
[24:45] order think of coming one becoming one
[24:47] with Christ it doesn't matter of every
[24:51] devil in hell comes against you when
[24:52] everything falls apart there's nothing
[24:54] there and it blows up there's nothing
[24:55] there and you don't know where you're
[24:57] standing what's going on there's a place
[24:58] to stand why because no matter what
[25:00] comes your way you're blessed in the
[25:02] Beloved we're sitting in Heavenly places
[25:05] I'm going to skip a little bit because
[25:06] there's a long quote everything is in
[25:08] divine order you got to put your trust
[25:10] in him walk the way he leads you if you
[25:12] just put your confidence in the word of
[25:13] God he justified me Sanctified me filled
[25:16] with the Holy Spirit brought me put me
[25:18] on the road that I'm supposed to be
[25:19] walking
[25:20] on I'm standing tonight on the divine
[25:22] order standing on the divine plan of God
[25:25] and you know what I can rest solely in
[25:26] that don't have to worry about anything
[25:28] that comes or goes why because there's a
[25:30] place to stand God wants us to realize
[25:32] who we are you don't have to worry about
[25:34] that see God who Satan really is Satan
[25:37] can only do what God allows him to do
[25:38] put your trust in
[25:40] him God's in
[25:42] control you go out uh when they were out
[25:45] at Sea and the ship was rocking
[25:46] everything looked like it was going to
[25:48] fall and they were ready uh the boat to
[25:49] sink said Lord you don't care we perish
[25:51] he wasn't worried he was in the back
[25:53] asleep we're so afraid because this
[25:55] terrible Storm is Coming wow
[25:59] because he was at rest he didn't have
[26:02] this if we have that same Spirit the
[26:05] same one that was on that boat we were
[26:07] in we're in him we walk shores of
[26:10] Galilee he didn't have any fear because
[26:13] he was one of his then you know what you
[26:15] don't have to worry about that God's
[26:17] Place For Us in the divine order that'll
[26:19] be where I'll stop there but just just
[26:20] keep in mind this romance that's going
[26:22] on there's so much there's many more
[26:25] things to that but anyway God bless you
[26:26] thank you amen
