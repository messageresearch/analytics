[2:42] quicken your word to us
[2:44] and make it real we ask in the name of
[2:46] the lord jesus christ amen amen
[2:49] now ii peter uh this is this is a very
[2:53] uh familiar scripture to us all and it
[2:55] says here in second peter of simon peter
[2:57] a servant and an apostle of jesus christ
[2:59] to them that have obtained like precious
[3:01] faith with us through the righteousness
[3:03] of god and our savior jesus christ
[3:06] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[3:08] through the knowledge of god and of
[3:10] jesus our lord
[3:11] according as his divine power it's his
[3:14] divine power that's given unto us hath
[3:16] given unto us all things that pertain
[3:18] unto life and godliness through the
[3:19] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[3:22] glory and virtue
[3:23] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[3:26] great and precious promises now there's
[3:28] something you can hang on to we've got a
[3:29] lot of promises that have been given to
[3:31] us that by these you might be partakers
[3:33] of the divine nature having escaped the
[3:36] corruption that is in the world through
[3:38] lust
[3:39] so he's given us a promise that we can
[3:41] be partakers of the divine nature
[3:43] and and a promise that if you obey the
[3:45] word and listen to the word and receive
[3:47] the word it'll call you out of the world
[3:49] and escape the corruption that is in the
[3:51] world through lust and he goes on and
[3:53] says and besides inside beside this
[3:56] giving all diligence
[3:58] add to your faith virtue and divert your
[4:00] knowledge into knowledge temperance and
[4:02] the temperance patience and the patience
[4:03] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[4:06] kindness and the brotherly kindness
[4:07] charity
[4:08] for if these things be in you and abound
[4:11] they make you that ye shall neither be
[4:12] bear nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
[4:14] our lord jesus christ
[4:16] but he that lacketh these things is
[4:18] blind and cannot see afar off and hath
[4:21] forgotten that he was purged from his
[4:23] old sins
[4:24] wherefore the rather brethren give
[4:26] diligence to make your calling and
[4:28] election sure for if you do these things
[4:30] you shall never fall
[4:32] for so and entrance shall be ministered
[4:34] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[4:36] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[4:38] christ
[4:39] you can be seated the lord has a
[4:40] blessing to the word
[4:43] now
[4:45] you know it's
[4:46] as you read i know this this scripture
[4:48] is very familiar to all of us and we've
[4:50] been taught with these what these things
[4:52] mean and you know what the kind of the
[4:54] the context of what this is uh peter's
[4:56] trying to lay out is that that the holy
[4:58] ghost the the the one that's given us
[5:00] the divine power the one that's made a
[5:02] way for us to to to be partakers of his
[5:05] divine nature has made a way the holy
[5:08] ghost the holy ghost is the one that's
[5:09] building a living tabernacle and the
[5:12] holy ghost is the one that's doing it so
[5:14] i want to i want to i want to make it
[5:15] maybe take a title for tonight's sermon
[5:18] as the holy ghost did it the holy ghost
[5:20] is the one that's doing it and we can
[5:22] have confidence if you know that the
[5:24] holy ghost has done something in your
[5:25] life then you know you can have
[5:27] confidence knowing that it's not
[5:28] something that you did not something
[5:30] that you manufactured not something that
[5:32] you put on if you look back in your life
[5:34] and see how god has brought you from
[5:36] here to here and you know that it's not
[5:38] something that you just said in a
[5:40] reading room or whatever and you're
[5:41] reciting some good scriptures or
[5:42] something but you know that the holy
[5:44] ghost is the one that has done it
[5:47] the holy ghost is the one that's
[5:49] building a living tabernacle the holy
[5:51] ghost works in such a way he does it in
[5:53] such a way that no man can take glory i
[5:56] i think that's such an amazing thing
[5:58] that the holy ghost does it is that when
[6:00] you come to church and you know a lot of
[6:02] people give glory to the minister or
[6:04] they'll give glory to themselves a lot
[6:05] of times where they want to put some
[6:06] somebody up in a high place but god will
[6:10] share his glory with no man
[6:12] and so he does it in a way that nobody
[6:14] else can get glory
[6:17] because the product that he the thing
[6:19] that he the result of of his action is
[6:22] something that you cannot look at and
[6:24] say well a man has done it uh the only
[6:26] the only way that it could be produced
[6:29] is is if god himself has come on the
[6:31] scene and does it and what he does is he
[6:34] takes he takes men and women
[6:36] that are caged up that are imprisoned
[6:38] from out in the world all bound up with
[6:40] the with the world and the lust of the
[6:42] world and the pride of life and things
[6:43] and he takes men and women like that off
[6:46] the off the side of the road as you say
[6:48] like rahab and all the all the ones that
[6:50] we know of in the old testament and and
[6:52] all through the bible as as
[6:54] illustrations and he takes those kind of
[6:56] people and he changes them and he
[6:59] changes them and makes them a tabernacle
[7:01] of the living god so you look
[7:04] you look and see what god has done at
[7:06] your own life and see what god has done
[7:08] in the church and you know that it's got
[7:10] to be the holy ghost that's done it now
[7:12] brother when he was preaching the statue
[7:15] of a perfect man he he began with an
[7:17] illustration of how he went to the zoo
[7:19] and he would look at all the animals in
[7:21] the zoo and he would think that these
[7:22] animals are caged up in the zoo and they
[7:24] ain't supposed to be caged up they're
[7:26] not supposed to be behind those bars and
[7:28] he said
[7:30] he said i go to the zoo and see them
[7:33] poor old animals and bears and lions and
[7:35] things walking back and forth prison for
[7:38] life you see makes you feel bad after
[7:41] all they're captured by the intelligence
[7:43] of a man who is smarter than they are
[7:46] and you see what he's trying to do he's
[7:48] trying to illustrate that those animals
[7:49] that he looks that he looked at when he
[7:51] went to the zoo that's just like people
[7:53] that they would be bound up and captured
[7:55] by somebody that's told them alive maybe
[7:58] somebody we're all like sheep and we
[8:00] need we nee we need a shepherd maybe
[8:02] somebody's told them a lie that's got
[8:04] them all bound up maybe the devil's told
[8:06] them a lie where they can't get free
[8:07] that they can't be loosed from the
[8:09] situation that they're in told them a
[8:11] lot you know the devil many times will
[8:12] tell christians that it don't matter
[8:14] that
[8:15] if you make a mistake as a christian
[8:17] that god won't let you repent that you
[8:19] can't come back and those you see those
[8:21] things are lies of the devil that will
[8:23] bind people and it keeps you in
[8:25] captivity and brother branham he was
[8:27] looking at those animals in the zoo
[8:28] maybe came across an eagle behind the
[8:30] bars and chained up and he and he looked
[8:32] at that situation and it it's not
[8:35] supposed to be that way
[8:37] he said they'd capture them and put them
[8:38] in captivity and he said i think about
[8:41] the devil does that he takes precious
[8:43] people who should roam god's great
[8:45] places and fields and things like that
[8:48] then put him in a prison house of some
[8:50] denomination or some creed or something
[8:52] and buying them up in there and what a
[8:54] horrible thing that is what a horrible
[8:57] thing for for a beautiful tiger with his
[8:59] stripes to be behind bars when he's
[9:01] supposed to be out on the savannah or in
[9:03] the jungle or whatever
[9:05] what about an eagle that's bound up
[9:06] where he can't fly away and he he said a
[9:09] horrible thing a horrible thing to see
[9:12] any anybody that's bound by any device
[9:14] of satan and it's a horrible thing to
[9:16] see a young person bound up by drugs or
[9:19] to see an old person bound up by
[9:21] jealousy or enmity or pride or lust it's
[9:24] a it's a it's a horrible thing to see a
[9:26] preacher that's bound up by false
[9:28] doctrine but i believe we've got the
[9:30] antidote
[9:32] he said and the eagle stirth up her nest
[9:34] he said i went down there and sat down
[9:36] there i couldn't keep from crying then
[9:38] something said to me he said you've seen
[9:40] worse than that to see men who's born to
[9:43] be sons of god shackled down by creeds
[9:46] and denominations and people that says
[9:49] the days of miracles has passed when
[9:51] he's actually born to be an eagle to fly
[9:53] in the lights of the heaven yonder
[9:55] brother under the power and supernatural
[9:58] strength of god to walk by faith and not
[10:00] by sight
[10:02] you see what he's saying that's the kind
[10:03] of person you're supposed to be that's
[10:05] the kind of believer you're supposed to
[10:07] be somebody that uh you're supposed to
[10:09] be like an eagle that can soar in the
[10:12] heights that can understand the the
[10:14] mysteries of god they could the soar in
[10:16] the heavenlies he said you were born to
[10:18] be an eagle to fly in the likes of the
[10:20] heaven yonder brother under the power
[10:23] and supernatural strength of god to walk
[10:25] by faith and not by sight do you realize
[10:28] this is actually who peter's talking to
[10:31] peter is talking to somebody who has
[10:33] heard the gospel to loose you from your
[10:35] bonds he's preaching to the people he's
[10:37] given them the recipe to come into the
[10:39] divine nature to just get swallowed up
[10:42] in christ and that's who he's talking to
[10:44] to somebody who's escaped the bonds of
[10:46] the devil
[10:50] he said you see this tabernacle brother
[10:52] said is not a holy ghost tabernacle
[10:55] let me let me go back he said
[10:57] you
[10:58] you when you go and study this uh the
[11:00] statue of a perfect man
[11:02] when the next sermon blasphemous names
[11:04] is where he he really he almost kind of
[11:07] adds some additional clarification to it
[11:09] and then in the blasphemous names he
[11:11] begins to talk about sister shepard's
[11:13] dream and in there he talks about how
[11:15] that uh
[11:16] she saw that dream of the rock box up at
[11:18] the top and there was a man up at the
[11:19] top who brother said with the the
[11:21] messenger of the age was pouring water
[11:23] into the into that rock rock box the
[11:25] messenger was pouring water and
[11:27] and and the man the man pouring water he
[11:30] said this is the this is the holy ghost
[11:32] and nothing will hold it and he said to
[11:34] see there's no such a thing as a holy
[11:36] church or holy organization the holy
[11:38] spirit can be preached in it but in
[11:40] there you find good and bad
[11:42] renegades and different and everything
[11:44] else so an organization will not hold
[11:47] that's why he was explaining that rock
[11:49] but it won't hold you can't hold the
[11:51] holy ghost in an organization bound up
[11:53] by by your creeds and your dog was bound
[11:56] bound by your idea he said you can't say
[11:59] we got it none of the rest of them has
[12:01] it no sir the holy spirit is poured out
[12:04] on individuals it's the individual in
[12:07] other words the holy that's that's the
[12:09] the main thing in my sermon this
[12:10] afternoon is the holy ghost is the thing
[12:13] that's doing it the holy ghost is the
[12:15] thing that will loose you from your
[12:16] denominational ideas and your your
[12:18] creeds and dogmas and the ideas that the
[12:20] devil is planted in your mind that you
[12:22] can't be delivered from your sin and he
[12:24] said this tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[12:26] tabernacle this tabernacle this building
[12:28] this building there's no such a thing
[12:30] individuals that come into this church
[12:32] is holy ghost tabernacles they are
[12:34] tabernacles that contain the holy ghost
[12:37] but not the church in the body a group
[12:39] therefore it runs out it runs out
[12:42] because you can't contain it by just a
[12:44] group of people or a denominational
[12:46] system or something but the holy ghost
[12:48] the intent of the holy ghost the purpose
[12:50] was to come and tabernacle himself in an
[12:52] individual and change that individual
[12:56] but it's the devil it's the devil that
[12:58] binds and imprisons
[13:00] you know so many times i think we kind
[13:01] of forget that it's the devil that do
[13:03] does the binding the it's not it's not
[13:06] people that that that are doing it so
[13:07] much it's the devil working in people
[13:09] and you know if you if a man were freed
[13:11] from a cage you would be so happy he was
[13:13] free you wouldn't go back and look at
[13:15] his life and say i remember all the
[13:16] scallywag stuff stuff you did we're so
[13:19] click quick to blame individuals for
[13:22] what the devil has done in their past
[13:23] even before they're saved and go back
[13:25] and say well look look at all the
[13:26] mistakes that you made look at all the
[13:28] things that you've done you know
[13:30] before you're before you're born again
[13:32] sinners sinners are going to sin sinners
[13:36] are going they're they're in sin but the
[13:37] devil is the one that's behind it all
[13:39] though you know the woman at the whale
[13:41] was probably a bad influence before she
[13:43] met jesus she was probably a bad
[13:45] influence to all the people that that
[13:46] she went around but one day she met
[13:48] jesus rahab on the wall maybe she maybe
[13:51] she wrecked a lot of homes before she
[13:53] met the spies before the spies came with
[13:55] their message but one day she met the
[13:57] spies and she heard a message of
[13:59] deliverance and she hung that scarlet
[14:01] cord outside on the wall and something
[14:03] in her life was changed you know paul
[14:05] was a murderer and calls many to
[14:07] blaspheme the bible says he had a lot of
[14:09] marks against him but one one day he saw
[14:12] the light on the road
[14:14] and after you've met jesus after
[14:16] something after the holy ghost has
[14:18] changed your life the bible says in
[14:20] romans chapter 8 verse 33 who shall lay
[14:23] anything to the charge of god's elect it
[14:26] is god that justifieth it's god that
[14:29] justifies you a justification that comes
[14:32] with a new birth when nobody can look at
[14:34] you and hold anything against you
[14:36] because you've been justified justified
[14:39] by the life of god coming in you and
[14:40] making your soul clean justified so that
[14:44] nothing can be held against you
[14:47] we should be the happiest people on the
[14:49] face of the earth that we've heard the
[14:50] word and it's made us clean on the
[14:53] inside
[14:57] now brother brown said we are unworthy
[14:59] we're talking talking about the you see
[15:01] it's not something we can do it's
[15:03] something that only the holy ghost can
[15:05] do he said we're unworthy he said
[15:08] there's nothing good about us and we're
[15:10] all in one big jailhouse no matter what
[15:14] corner we stand in we're still all in
[15:16] jail one could not help the other now
[15:20] you see if one can't help the other then
[15:22] we can't we have nothing to boast of we
[15:24] have nothing to be prideful of that
[15:26] would say to say look what i did look
[15:28] look at the great thing that i have done
[15:31] but god brother brown said and his
[15:33] infinite mercy came down and opened the
[15:36] prison doors to set us free and he said
[15:38] we're no longer caged up now we're not
[15:41] in the zoo of the world but now we are
[15:43] free we're outside and who did it it
[15:46] wasn't us that did it it was the holy
[15:48] ghost it didn't i didn't do it and you
[15:51] didn't do it he did it all brother brown
[15:54] said sin made the great blockade and now
[15:57] sin has been took away by the blood of
[15:59] jesus now we are bound for the promised
[16:01] land by the promise of god which is
[16:04] eternal
[16:05] and that's who peter's talking to
[16:07] peter's talking to somebody who's been
[16:09] set free who's escaped the bonds of the
[16:12] earth of the world of the world systems
[16:14] who's escaped the pride of life and the
[16:16] lust of the flesh who's not going around
[16:18] bound by alcoholism and drugs and uh
[16:22] just jealousy and enmity but you've been
[16:24] set free because you've received the
[16:26] word
[16:28] and as simon peter said he said simon
[16:30] peter a servant and an apostle of jesus
[16:32] christ to them that have obtained like
[16:35] precious faith with us through the
[16:37] righteousness of god and our savior
[16:39] jesus christ
[16:41] and he said in verse 4 whereby are given
[16:43] unto us exceeding great and precious
[16:45] promises that by these you might be made
[16:48] you might be partakers of the divine
[16:50] nature having what having escaped the
[16:53] corruption that is in the world through
[16:55] lust you know you can look in the news
[16:58] and look in the papers and look out in
[16:59] the world and see all the stuff that's
[17:01] gripping the world and
[17:03] we should be so thankful that we've
[17:04] escaped out of that even though we're in
[17:06] the world we're not of the world even
[17:08] though we're living here we've escaped
[17:10] out of that stuff
[17:14] to them that have obtained like precious
[17:16] faith because the whole thing is based
[17:19] on faith
[17:20] he's saying that i have obtained this
[17:22] faith and i'm addressing this to them
[17:24] that has obtained the like precious
[17:26] faith it's not to the outside world this
[17:29] is to the church those that are in
[17:31] christ he said we have escaped he's
[17:34] telling us those who have escaped
[17:37] he's trying to tell those who who have
[17:39] escaped how to be more
[17:41] like christ
[17:43] how to be more like christ
[17:46] now the way he explained it in the
[17:47] statue of perfect man he said there's
[17:49] not there's not one person sitting here
[17:51] that doesn't want to be more like christ
[17:53] and he went through all the different
[17:55] ones in the in the congregation that
[17:56] we're getting the old and you know we've
[17:58] got many that are old here the sister
[18:00] cletus 95 that uh
[18:03] you know you know you can't the point
[18:05] he's trying to make is even though
[18:06] you're maybe oh way older than anybody
[18:09] else yet still yet still you still have
[18:12] that desire to draw closer and closer to
[18:15] god no matter what stage you are in life
[18:17] whether you're a minister a deacon
[18:19] whatever you are a little child every
[18:21] christian
[18:22] wants to be more like christ that should
[18:25] be your desire if you don't leave with
[18:27] anything else this afternoon go home and
[18:30] say i want to be more like jesus if
[18:32] there's anything else
[18:34] everything else pales in comparison than
[18:35] to be like jesus i want to be he said a
[18:38] christian wants to be swallowed up in
[18:40] him so swallowed up in christ until
[18:43] christ takes over and there's nothing
[18:45] left to me nothing left of myself but
[18:48] it's all crushed
[18:51] you know what the gospel message is a
[18:52] takeover message that god came down holy
[18:55] host came down and he's taken over the
[18:58] situation
[18:59] and now he said god wants to be so part
[19:02] god wants you to be so part of him so
[19:04] swallowed up by his love now if a
[19:07] christian wants to be swallowed up in
[19:09] him and god wants you to be so sp
[19:12] part of him so swallowed up by his love
[19:15] that you are one that you can't lose he
[19:18] wants that and you want it and now he's
[19:20] giving you the recipe he's unlocked the
[19:23] door so that you could have just be
[19:25] swallowed up in him and be one with him
[19:28] brother said excuse this expression i
[19:30] told my wife
[19:31] both getting old and i said to her do
[19:33] you love me like you used to she said i
[19:35] certainly do and i said you know i love
[19:37] you so much still i would like to take
[19:38] you and pull you inside of me so that we
[19:40] could just really be one more and he
[19:43] said now multiply that by a hundred
[19:45] million and then you'll find out that
[19:46] the believer who falls in love with
[19:48] christ wants to get into him because
[19:51] it's a love and here he's going to show
[19:53] us how that through these promises we
[19:55] might be partakers of christ's divine
[19:57] nature these mortal body how that we can
[20:00] be partakers i want to ask you this
[20:02] afternoon are you so in love with god
[20:05] that you want to fall you just want to
[20:06] be swallowed up by him are you so in
[20:09] love with god that coming to church
[20:11] matters more than anything that the
[20:12] world can throw at you it matters more
[20:15] than the family events that somebody and
[20:17] family is and your family is heaven on
[20:19] sunday that matters more than than
[20:21] anything they're doing at your school or
[20:23] something coming to church preeminates
[20:25] everything because you want god you want
[20:28] to be swallowed up in him
[20:31] so swallowed up in christ until he
[20:34] completes and completely takes over he
[20:37] said we've got to be so in love with him
[20:39] till when we ask for something and he
[20:40] doesn't give to us that doesn't shake us
[20:43] a bit and the only way you can do that
[20:45] is to become partakers of his divine
[20:47] nature
[20:48] then you'll understand the reason he
[20:50] can't give it to you
[20:52] so who's peter talking to he's talking
[20:54] to those that have escaped
[20:56] having escaped the corruption that is in
[20:57] the world through lust escaped it say
[21:00] who is to
[21:01] now as to the church them who are in
[21:04] christ has been exalted above these
[21:06] things because when you escape
[21:09] you know brother in one place brother
[21:10] adam said when you're a sinner you're on
[21:12] your way down but when you when you're
[21:14] saved suddenly your trajectory changes
[21:17] and you begin going up why do you begin
[21:20] to go on up because the holy ghost is
[21:22] taking you up you can't help but go
[21:24] because he's taking you up and he's
[21:26] exalting you he's bringing you up
[21:29] and you can't exalt yourself
[21:32] the holy ghost brings you out and takes
[21:34] you up and positionally places not by
[21:36] man's power not by might but the holy
[21:39] ghost is the one doing it
[21:43] not you because you can't put yourself
[21:45] up
[21:46] that's why he said you can't add any of
[21:48] these virtues as much as you strain and
[21:50] try you can't add these virtues to it
[21:52] it's got to be something automatic
[21:55] something automatic that the holy ghost
[21:57] is doing
[21:59] that's why matthew chapter 23 verse 12
[22:01] says who whosoever shall exalt himself
[22:03] shall be abased and he that shall humble
[22:06] himself shall be exalted now in that
[22:08] isn't that a paradox an odd thing seems
[22:10] like it's flipped on its head that you
[22:11] would think the way to get up would be
[22:13] to try to force and try to try to try to
[22:16] try to try to
[22:18] try to make something happen try to
[22:20] manufacture it but the way up is
[22:22] actually the way down to get as small
[22:24] and humble as you can so that god can
[22:26] actually work within you that's that's
[22:28] the way you preach the gospel is lord i
[22:30] can't do it i need you to come on the
[22:32] sea because it's the holy ghost that
[22:34] does it the holy ghost is the one that
[22:36] do it does it the holy ghost is the one
[22:38] that's living in you it seems to be
[22:40] exalted many times many times what god
[22:43] does is he'll actually bring you to a
[22:45] place where you get way way down before
[22:48] he'll empty you out you see he'll empty
[22:50] you out before he fills you up he'll
[22:52] come make you come through a place where
[22:54] you go through a dark dark valley maybe
[22:56] the valley of the shadow of death like
[22:58] and you're looking around at all the
[23:00] gloom and then you go through that time
[23:02] and you begin to realize that he is the
[23:04] same yesterday today and forever and you
[23:06] come out on the other side filled up
[23:11] now i i was listening you you think
[23:13] about think about david going going
[23:14] through all those times where he was out
[23:16] in the sheep code and nobody thought he
[23:18] was anything and he was the last of all
[23:20] his brothers and his father looked down
[23:22] on him and and god called him out of
[23:24] that so that he could fill him up and
[23:26] use him solomon that when it when he was
[23:28] made king he he got before the lord and
[23:30] he said he you remember that prayer that
[23:32] solomon prayed he said i don't even know
[23:34] how to go out or come in you think about
[23:37] humbleness homeless of mine and of
[23:39] spirit to say something like that i
[23:41] don't even know how to go out the door
[23:43] god i don't even know how to come in but
[23:45] god i pray that you'll collect it struck
[23:48] me give me something give me something
[23:50] from the spirit of god so that i know
[23:52] how to do so that i don't know how to
[23:54] leave these people job on the ash heap
[23:56] that said i it was on the ash sheep
[23:58] scraping his balls and he had lost
[24:00] everything but he said i know in my
[24:02] flesh that i'll see god you see how god
[24:05] will bring you down before he exalts you
[24:07] many times now
[24:10] now i was listening to that
[24:12] you might have seen that that testimony
[24:14] of the of the the brother in africa
[24:16] that's a prophet of the lord that
[24:18] brother joseph back there put on youtube
[24:20] and and if you go back and listen to his
[24:22] testimony he's telling he tells in his
[24:24] testimony about how that he was
[24:26] his family had kicked him out and and
[24:28] beside the road and he was having to he
[24:30] was having to uh he didn't have any food
[24:33] and he he was so hungry that what he
[24:35] would do was pray pray all night so that
[24:38] he would get tired and fall asleep and
[24:40] then we'd wake up again because his
[24:42] family had kicked him out his whole
[24:43] family wanted to murder him and
[24:45] and and he had a god gave him a vision
[24:47] if you go listen to that testimony god
[24:49] gave him a vision and the vision was god
[24:52] showed him in that vision first i'm
[24:53] going to empty you out and then i'm
[24:55] going to fill you up and you see that's
[24:57] that's scriptural because joseph was
[24:59] dumped in a well and left for nothing
[25:01] moses was emptied out in the wilderness
[25:03] but then then he saw the pillar of fire
[25:05] and god came and emptied it and filled
[25:07] him up so if you'll stay down low that
[25:09] is the way to be exalted
[25:12] you see many who seek to exalt or
[25:14] promote themselves if you want to
[25:16] promote yourself as something skewed in
[25:18] your thinking but if you get the holy
[25:19] ghost in your life the holy ghost will
[25:21] will show you the right way to go up and
[25:23] the right way to go up is to go down as
[25:26] far as you you know i was listening
[25:29] out in the yard sometimes i'll listen to
[25:30] sermons while i'm doing yard work and i
[25:32] got to i was listening through all the
[25:34] seals and i got to the fifth seal
[25:36] and i think it's
[25:38] i think it's that sermon and the first
[25:40] 15 minutes of that sermon brother
[25:42] branham was explaining how simple it is
[25:44] how simple and how god will go over the
[25:46] heads and the whole thing the whole
[25:48] gospel is about simplicity
[25:50] that's what so many people they miss the
[25:53] mystery of the seals because the seals
[25:55] are
[25:57] most of the time brother brown's talking
[25:58] it seems like he's talking about things
[26:00] that you already know but buried in
[26:03] there woman in there is a mystery that's
[26:05] hidden in there and it's hidden it's
[26:07] hidden from the wise and prudent but
[26:09] revealed and the babes such as we'll
[26:11] learn
[26:14] that's why the bible says i thank thee
[26:15] oh father lord of heaven and earth
[26:17] because thou hast hid these things from
[26:19] the wise and prudent and has to reveal
[26:21] them unto babes if we'll just lower
[26:23] ourselves and get down so we can
[26:24] actually
[26:25] that's our problem so many times is
[26:27] we'll hear a message preached and we'll
[26:28] think within ourselves well i've already
[26:30] heard that and now is a good time for a
[26:32] nap we'll hear somebody preach a sermon
[26:34] like maybe maybe tonight preaching the
[26:36] statue of a perfect man and you'll think
[26:38] that i've already heard that sermon
[26:40] that's the same problem that we do when
[26:41] we listen to the seals because it sounds
[26:44] like he's saying something that we
[26:46] already know and that's why so many
[26:48] people have become confused they listen
[26:50] to it and they think well we already
[26:52] know what what is the mystery but if you
[26:54] listen to it and let the holy ghost
[26:55] reveal it to you something will begin to
[26:58] pop out of that message a mystery
[27:00] something god's saying something
[27:02] in simplicity
[27:04] because where's god hidden
[27:06] he's hidden in simplicity and revealing
[27:08] the same and what could be more
[27:10] simplicity what could be more simple
[27:12] than god hiding himself in the
[27:14] tabernacle of your flesh hiding himself
[27:17] in you what could be more simple than
[27:19] that
[27:21] you see we've escaped we've escaped and
[27:24] that's who that's who peter's talking to
[27:27] that's right
[27:29] people that
[27:31] people that have escaped you know that's
[27:32] one of the one of the evidences one of
[27:35] the reasons one of the ways that we we
[27:37] know something has been has been done in
[27:39] our lives that the holy ghost has had an
[27:41] effect because we can look back
[27:43] and see that we've escaped we can we've
[27:46] come out of something we've been changed
[27:47] and we can look back
[27:50] brother said that's how we know that
[27:51] we've passed from death unto life we
[27:53] look back to the pit
[27:58] we look back to the pit where we was
[27:59] healed from
[28:02] excuse me
[28:04] we're not what we want to be we're not
[28:06] even what we ought to be but one thing
[28:07] we're thankful for we're not what we
[28:09] used to be that's right we're on the
[28:11] road and we can look back and we can see
[28:12] where we came from do you remember that
[28:14] story in the book of acts where peter
[28:16] peter was down in the jail cell and
[28:18] he was it he was
[28:22] peter was in the jail cell and and he he
[28:24] was imprisoned he was a prisoner and he
[28:26] was down in the jail cell and
[28:28] and all of a sudden the angel came to
[28:30] him and began to escort him out of the
[28:32] jail cell and began to open up the doors
[28:34] and he found himself on the outside and
[28:36] he came to himself and he looked back
[28:38] and he began to realize that he wasn't
[28:40] where he wasn't where he came from the
[28:42] bible says that when peter was come to
[28:44] himself he said now i know of assurity
[28:46] that the lord has sent his angel and has
[28:48] delivered me out of the hand of herod
[28:50] and from all the expectation of the
[28:52] people of the jews now can't we say that
[28:54] when we look back and we see now i know
[28:56] for surety that it was the holy ghost in
[28:58] my life that did it now i know for sure
[29:01] because i can look back and i can see
[29:02] the jail cell the place where i came
[29:04] from something in my life has been
[29:06] changed the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[29:09] the one that did it
[29:11] you know i'm i'm so glad that i had
[29:13] nothing to do with it
[29:15] nothing to boast of aren't you glad that
[29:17] you had nothing to do with it it was all
[29:19] the holy ghost nothing to crow about i
[29:22] know it was him and him alone
[29:27] now that's the type of person that he's
[29:28] talking to
[29:30] the type of person that peter is talking
[29:31] to as the person that can look back and
[29:33] see where they come from that they come
[29:35] out of so they come out of the jail cell
[29:37] and they're on the road the person that
[29:39] has escaped these things see the
[29:40] corruption of the world besides escaping
[29:43] the world
[29:44] peter's saying besides escaping the
[29:46] world
[29:47] let's just get swallowed up in christ
[29:50] that's why he says and beside this
[29:51] giving all diligence add unto your faith
[29:54] virtue
[29:55] and divert you knowledge and the
[29:57] knowledge temperance to temperance
[29:59] patience to patience godliness and to
[30:01] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[30:03] brotherly kindness charity
[30:05] how how we gonna do that the way seems
[30:09] all sealed up
[30:10] but faith
[30:11] faith is the way that it is faith is the
[30:15] thing that unlocks the door
[30:17] now brother baby said the key is faith
[30:19] the faith holds the key and the key is
[30:22] the scripture and christ is the door see
[30:25] so it's faith holds the key that unlocks
[30:28] christ to the people unlocks it reveals
[30:31] it so you see you know peter peter was
[30:34] peter was sent to unlock the
[30:36] supernatural to the three groups of
[30:38] people to ham shem and japeth to the
[30:40] gentiles jews and the samaritans so
[30:42] peter was sent to preach a message that
[30:44] would unlock the supernatural them and
[30:46] here he's unlocking the way to get
[30:48] swallowed up in the divine nature
[30:51] unlock well see if you don't know if you
[30:53] don't know that you need these things
[30:55] then you don't you can't even approach
[30:57] to it but when it begins to be preached
[30:59] something begins to unlock when the word
[31:01] is going over the pulpit when the word
[31:03] is received in your heart something
[31:04] begins to unlock something begins to
[31:06] move and and so that's why
[31:09] that's why the gospel is actually a
[31:11] message to open up something to lose
[31:13] something
[31:15] he said so that so today we're going to
[31:17] try to take that same key to unlock the
[31:19] way to become a virtuous christian and
[31:22] the stature of god that and be a living
[31:25] tabernacle for the living god to dwell
[31:27] in
[31:28] now now he takes a quick detour here
[31:31] he said now after we get through with
[31:32] the seven seals
[31:34] at that time of the sounding of the
[31:36] seventh seal
[31:37] now we're talking about loosening up
[31:39] loosen something
[31:40] he said oh the loosening course we know
[31:42] what a seal is is to loose the ministry
[31:45] to lose seven seals to loose the
[31:48] ministry to actually give something in
[31:50] the hands of the ministry so they have
[31:52] something to preach something to preach
[31:54] so that they so that the door is
[31:56] unlocked for the people and he said
[31:57] we'll see that right on the chart as
[31:59] losing a message
[32:01] losing a message something that's sealed
[32:03] up
[32:05] so now i believe that the message has
[32:07] been loosed it's been opened up so that
[32:09] we can preach it so that we can proclaim
[32:11] it he said the way of escape has been
[32:14] loosed that the way to the divine nature
[32:16] has been loosed
[32:21] the way to a body change has been loosed
[32:25] the ministry has been loose see see now
[32:27] we've got something to preach because
[32:29] all these things have been loosed the
[32:30] gospel has been loosed and now the way
[32:33] to to being swallowed up in the divine
[32:35] nature has been loosed in matthew 16 19
[32:38] it says i will give unto thee the keys
[32:40] of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[32:42] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[32:44] in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt
[32:46] loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
[32:48] and how do you lose something now how
[32:49] are you buying something by the
[32:50] preaching of the word the word is
[32:52] actually what will loose the captive
[32:54] from his change so
[32:56] what do you mean loose from something
[32:58] loose from realize thinking that you
[33:00] don't have a purpose in this life
[33:02] thinking that that the promises of god
[33:04] are not true but when you hear the
[33:06] gospel preached it actually looses you
[33:08] from the captivity that the devil has
[33:10] over your mind
[33:11] now you know that god has made you for a
[33:13] purpose and that purpose is to manifest
[33:16] deity and i believe that's that's the
[33:18] message that has been loosed to to bring
[33:20] to the people a message that god's
[33:22] purpose for you is actually to manifest
[33:25] deity to actually manifest god to
[33:27] tabernacle god in your flesh
[33:31] he said now remember god reveals himself
[33:33] in three ways first time he revealed
[33:36] himself in a pillar of fire that was
[33:38] called the fatherhood then that same god
[33:40] made manifest in jesus christ which he
[33:42] built a body made this body thirdly
[33:44] through the death of that body he
[33:46] sanctified a church that he can dwell in
[33:48] it was god above us god with us god in
[33:50] us the same god what is it god
[33:53] condescending to his creation god wants
[33:55] to be worshiped the word god means
[33:57] object of worship and it's god trying to
[34:00] condition his people so he can get from
[34:02] them what he created them for
[34:05] he never made you to be something else
[34:07] besides a son and daughter of god do you
[34:10] realize that's actually the secret to
[34:11] depression many people talk about how
[34:13] they're all wound up with depression but
[34:15] even a psychologist will tell you that
[34:17] if you want to get rid of your
[34:18] depression to find some purpose yeah
[34:20] i've heard psychologists say before that
[34:22] you know if you're depressed then start
[34:24] cleaning your room and if you start
[34:26] cleaning your room then you'll begin to
[34:28] find purpose well god has given us a
[34:30] purpose and that'll that that purpose is
[34:33] that purpose is the thing that will
[34:34] loose you to realize that god
[34:37] if he can get get from you what he
[34:39] created for you and he never made you to
[34:42] be something else besides the son and
[34:43] daughter of god that's actually what he
[34:46] made he said know how that god is in his
[34:48] church the church is now supposed to be
[34:51] taking the place of of christ carrying
[34:53] on his ministry so your purpose in life
[34:56] is actually to carry on the ministry of
[34:58] jesus christ that god himself could
[35:00] tabernacle himself in you
[35:03] now in acts chapter 7 verse 48 47-48 it
[35:06] says but solomon built him a house
[35:09] howbeit the most high dwelleth not in
[35:11] tabernacles made with hands i saith the
[35:13] prophet
[35:14] heaven is my throne and earth is my foot
[35:16] so what house will you build me seth the
[35:18] lord or what is the place of my rest
[35:19] what house because he doesn't want just
[35:21] a house that you build but he wants to
[35:23] actually live in you that's what he
[35:25] that's what god's purpose is to
[35:27] tabernacle himself in you and in hebrews
[35:29] 10 4 5 it says for it's not possible
[35:32] that the blood of bulls and goats should
[35:34] take away sins wherefore when he cometh
[35:36] into the world he saith sacrifice and
[35:38] offering thou wouldest not but a body
[35:41] has now prepared me a body a body that
[35:43] he could live in a tabernacle himself in
[35:46] he prepared the body of jesus christ
[35:48] that he could come and live in and
[35:49] tabernacle himself in and now he wants
[35:52] to live in your body a body has now
[35:55] prepared me god dwells in the statute of
[35:57] a man reflecting himself into that being
[36:00] he wants to dwell in a man he wants to
[36:02] walk in in your feet he said god has
[36:06] always at all time reflected himself in
[36:08] man god and moses somebody born in time
[36:11] of persecution of children a lawgiver
[36:14] god reflecting himself joseph born a
[36:17] spiritual boy among a bunch of brethren
[36:19] see all these different things that god
[36:22] reflecting himself that's god's great
[36:24] plan and purpose is to actually
[36:26] tabernacle himself inside you and use
[36:28] him to manifest his deity and he said
[36:31] since that time he has reflected himself
[36:33] in his church this side of calvary so
[36:36] you see we're all trying to get to this
[36:38] dwelling place the tabernacle of the
[36:41] living god
[36:42] that's all where we're trying to get to
[36:44] to be swallowed up in him just so that
[36:46] god can christ can just take us over
[36:48] now peter is outlining something here
[36:50] for us that how to get here
[36:54] now see
[36:55] brother brown begins to explain in the
[36:57] message he says now some people some
[36:58] people who have a portion of all these
[37:00] virtues they got a portion of all these
[37:02] things that don't even profess to be a
[37:04] christian because just just from your
[37:06] natural birth just from coming into the
[37:08] world from your natural mama and daddy
[37:09] there's people that are a little bit
[37:11] more patient than other people there's
[37:12] people that have a strength to them and
[37:14] and all these there's people that know
[37:16] that are good in school and they can
[37:17] accumulate knowledge and they know a lot
[37:20] of things but that won't do it some
[37:22] people are naturally patient they know a
[37:24] lot of information they got good good
[37:26] common sense they can give advice
[37:28] they've kind of got natural wisdom but
[37:30] you see that won't do it and a lot of
[37:32] times we'll take that instead of the
[37:34] real thing we'll try to we'll try to
[37:36] take the thing that we've got from our
[37:38] natural birth and substitute it for the
[37:40] thing that what god wants to give us
[37:42] through the new birth
[37:44] but it's the holy ghost that does it
[37:47] it's the holy ghost that's doing it it's
[37:49] not something that we do it we're you
[37:51] see we're all we're talking about
[37:53] something that only the holy ghost can
[37:55] give a holy ghost life and a holy ghost
[37:58] tabernacle making a holy ghost man
[38:02] that's what we're talking about and
[38:04] peter's delivering this message to
[38:05] people that have escaped the world and
[38:07] and they've been born again and now
[38:09] they've escaped the life of god has been
[38:11] given unto him and now he's trying to
[38:13] tell you how to be so swallowed up in
[38:15] christ that god can have the preeminence
[38:17] in your life but religion is not enough
[38:21] religion ain't enough uh well so many
[38:23] times we'll we'll we'll
[38:25] you know early on in your maybe in your
[38:27] christian journey you'll go to the to
[38:28] the christian bookstore and you look at
[38:30] all the books they got on the wall and
[38:32] you'll think and you begin to pour
[38:34] through them and you know they're
[38:35] self-help books and books on to tell you
[38:37] how to how to have a better marriage and
[38:39] all those things and you begin to take
[38:41] all those detours but you really what
[38:44] you need is not all those books that are
[38:46] lying in the walls of the christian
[38:48] bookstore but to go back to the word of
[38:50] god and actually find actually dive into
[38:53] the word of god there is no substitute
[38:55] for the word of god that's what that man
[38:58] in sister shepherd's dream was pouring
[39:00] into that rock box was the word of god
[39:02] the actual living word and that's the
[39:04] thing that will change you because only
[39:06] the holy ghost will do it
[39:08] only the holy ghost can do it
[39:12] self-help books ain't enough uh religion
[39:14] ain't enough religion just trying to
[39:16] attack on some some nice bird feathers
[39:18] ain't enough brother ryan said see he
[39:20] compared he made four different
[39:22] comparisons he compared it to it's like
[39:24] a black bird trying to put peacock
[39:27] feathers now that's a bird trying to put
[39:30] another bird's feathers
[39:32] in it to look like that bird but it's
[39:35] real close
[39:37] cause it's birds
[39:38] it's not a it's not a a cow trying to
[39:41] put further feathers on his back it's
[39:44] something that's real close
[39:46] a bird a black bird trying to put
[39:48] peacock feathers in his wings to make
[39:51] him a peacock he only disgraces himself
[39:54] now now he goes to a tree it's like a
[39:56] sycamore tree
[39:58] trying to manufacture apples and now you
[40:01] got two trees
[40:02] it's not a mule trying to manufacture
[40:05] apples it's a tree trying to manufacture
[40:08] apples but it ain't an apple tree it's a
[40:10] sycamore tree and you see how close it
[40:13] is you can look real close and have a
[40:15] lot of religion and come to church and
[40:17] sit on the pew just like just next to
[40:20] somebody else who's also a tree also a
[40:23] bird also the genuine thing but the
[40:26] thing that matters is the holy ghost on
[40:28] the inside because if you've got the
[40:30] life on the inside the life of the apple
[40:32] tree is what makes the apples the life
[40:35] of the peacock is what makes the peacock
[40:37] feathers and all the imitation all the
[40:39] substituting won't do it the holy ghost
[40:42] is the only thing that can do it now i'm
[40:44] trying to preach i believe the message
[40:46] is a positive message and i'm preaching
[40:48] a positive message and i want you to
[40:50] look back those of you that got the new
[40:52] birth that have come a long way to look
[40:53] back in your life and remember where you
[40:55] came from so that your faith can be
[40:58] built up to know that it's the holy
[41:00] ghost that's doing it it wasn't you
[41:02] doing it all this time but it's the holy
[41:04] ghost doing it you know i know for many
[41:07] years this is a message that can be
[41:08] preached in a lot of different ways and
[41:10] many times it might have been
[41:12] appropriate to preach the statute for
[41:13] perfect man in a way that maybe pushes
[41:16] you down and causes you to come to a
[41:18] place where you know you need to repent
[41:20] but i believe now you know you hear
[41:22] after after that message the brother
[41:24] preached on sunday the bride is coming
[41:25] to a place where she's coming to a place
[41:27] where she begins to speak and i believe
[41:30] it's time to look back and have
[41:32] confidence that it was the holy ghost
[41:34] doing it all this time
[41:38] and he said
[41:39] the next comparison was a four-legged
[41:41] animal he said it's like a mule trying
[41:43] to manufacture wool a mule trying to
[41:46] trying to act like a sheep
[41:48] not a mule trying to act like a bird but
[41:50] a mule trying to act like a sheep and
[41:53] the other one example was another bird
[41:55] he said or a vulture trying to eat with
[41:57] a dove a vulture that ain't got what it
[42:00] takes to digest right that ain't got
[42:02] what it takes to eat the things that the
[42:04] dove's eating a
[42:05] vulture sitting up in the church and
[42:07] saying yeah i understand all the things
[42:10] but he don't know what the dove knows
[42:12] because he can't stomach it you see how
[42:14] close it is a bird and a bird a tree and
[42:17] a tree a mule or a a four-legged animal
[42:20] and a sheep it's so close but you got to
[42:23] have the thing down on the inside and
[42:25] that thing is the holy ghost because
[42:27] that's the only thing that's going to
[42:29] change you that's the only thing that's
[42:31] going to carry you through
[42:34] it might look close
[42:36] but we don't want close
[42:38] we don't walk close church we want the
[42:40] real thing
[42:41] we want the genuine thing
[42:46] and i believe that the real thing is
[42:48] available how do we know that the real
[42:50] thing is available because the seals
[42:52] have been opened and the seals open up
[42:54] loose the message that can be preached a
[42:57] message that the real thing is available
[42:59] the real thing is here if you'll just
[43:01] open up your heart and believe it it
[43:02] gets sincere with god get serious about
[43:05] it the real thing is available
[43:09] the weight of the real thing has been
[43:10] loosed you see now we've got access
[43:14] revelation chapter 4 talks about a door
[43:16] open in heaven and i believe the door is
[43:18] open so that we can go through it now
[43:20] it's been opened up so that we have a
[43:22] way to access us access the supernatural
[43:26] access of faith that will change our
[43:28] bodies access of faith that will take us
[43:30] out of here
[43:32] and the real thing is the real thing is
[43:34] resting on it
[43:36] not manufactured the sheep doesn't
[43:37] manufacture he's got he's he has wool
[43:40] because he's a sheep a lot of people try
[43:42] to say well i'll try to get good i'll
[43:44] try to get good i'll try to do this
[43:48] don't manufacture nothing
[43:51] no you can't do it these are brothers
[43:53] words he said no you can't do it you
[43:56] cannot manufacture something listen if
[43:58] you bound up by depression if you're
[44:00] bound up by pornography you cannot do it
[44:03] you cannot loose yourself just by trying
[44:06] and straining real hard but let the word
[44:08] of god be received in a penitent heart
[44:11] and something will begin to work the
[44:13] holy ghost will begin to take action he
[44:16] said a sheep doesn't is an ass isn't
[44:18] expected to manufacture wool it bears
[44:21] wool and it does it because it's a sheep
[44:23] and when you're a christian you just
[44:25] bear the fruit of the spirit you don't
[44:28] manufacture it you don't try to make it
[44:30] up
[44:31] don't make yourself something that
[44:33] you're not you just become what you're
[44:35] supposed to be
[44:36] and then
[44:38] it takes care of itself
[44:42] you know what manufacturing is
[44:44] when you when you come to church and
[44:45] you're around other believers and you
[44:46] begin to say i i better do this
[44:49] i better act this way i better not say
[44:52] this
[44:53] i better i better not do that i gotta
[44:55] manufacture it i better i better have
[44:57] virtue i better have some knowledge i
[44:59] better have some godliness
[45:01] how are you gonna get godliness by
[45:03] trying to pump it up trying to
[45:04] manufacture it but if there's the thing
[45:06] the real thing the holy ghost down on
[45:08] the inside it comes out naturally it
[45:12] just comes out like the lily through the
[45:14] mud the nearly beginning
[45:15] it germinates and begins to grow and
[45:17] it's surrounded by mud it's surrounded
[45:20] by the filth of the world the quagmire
[45:22] of the world but it begins to put you up
[45:24] and come out
[45:25] and
[45:27] all you can do to stop it is still
[45:29] coming out why because listen when
[45:31] you're born again your trajectory has
[45:33] changed from down to up you're going up
[45:37] but only the holy ghost can do it it's
[45:39] innate it's inborn that's why you've got
[45:42] to be born again because when you're
[45:44] born again it's just part of you it's
[45:46] just down on the inside just doing it
[45:48] not religion but everybody said well
[45:50] brother brown i know this certain woman
[45:52] over here why she never did do anything
[45:54] wrong she's a good woman
[45:57] well this such is such a man he's a good
[45:59] man
[46:00] he never does anything you know he
[46:02] doesn't harm anybody
[46:04] that's why i've told i've told my kids
[46:05] be careful who you're married cause you
[46:07] don't want somebody that's just good be
[46:09] careful how you raise your kids because
[46:10] you don't want to raise your kids just
[46:12] so that they're goody two-shoes but you
[46:14] want to raise them so that they are
[46:16] saved because a goody two-shoe a goodie
[46:18] two-shoe it doesn't do no good it's just
[46:21] religion it won't do nothing it won't
[46:23] you can't add these virtues just to a
[46:25] goodie to you he said do you look at
[46:27] anything he's talking about a christian
[46:28] that ain't born again you look at
[46:29] anything say i just don't see it and you
[46:32] don't understand it a man can't
[46:34] understand why people shout a man can't
[46:36] understand why a human being's language
[46:37] would change and he'd speak in tongues
[46:39] the natural man can't see how a glory of
[46:41] god would ever come over a man's eyes
[46:43] and he see vision and tell man of
[46:45] certain things but when you're born
[46:47] again you can begin to see
[46:49] you can begin to understand why the
[46:51] gospel makes somebody happy why people
[46:53] want to come to church why you want to
[46:55] get around christians you begin to
[46:57] understand because something in your
[46:59] life has begun to change the holy ghost
[47:02] is the one that does it he's the one
[47:04] that does the changing he's changing
[47:06] your nature he's changing your thinking
[47:08] he's changing your walk and he's
[47:10] changing your talk he's changing
[47:12] everything about you so that you just
[47:14] get swallowed up in the divine nature
[47:18] and faith is the foundation that's why
[47:20] you got to be born again
[47:22] he said when you're born again you can't
[47:24] be born again without having faith
[47:27] so you see on my chart here he said i
[47:30] got the very foundation
[47:32] faith is the foundation of all of it
[47:34] being born again now listen
[47:36] you know there's like little nuggets in
[47:38] the message when you when you go combing
[47:40] through there's little things that you
[47:41] can just grab hold to and hang on now
[47:44] listen listen to this
[47:45] he says if you've got faith
[47:48] and he's talking about healing and
[47:51] he said therefore when you say brother
[47:52] branham i believe that god is a healer
[47:53] if you believe that and accept him as
[47:55] your healer and not lying but actually
[47:56] believing that his by stripes you are
[47:58] healed
[48:00] there's nothing going to turn you from
[48:03] it
[48:04] it's a settled thing now that's a
[48:06] weighty statement to have
[48:08] that if you got faith
[48:10] nothing is going to turn you from it
[48:14] let's say it like this if you've been
[48:15] born again i believe this will give you
[48:18] confidence this afternoon if you've been
[48:20] born again nothing is going to turn you
[48:22] from the truth
[48:24] nothing is going to turn you can never i
[48:27] believe this is the evidence you can
[48:29] never say i don't believe this message
[48:31] and leave it away because you can never
[48:34] be turned away from it you can never be
[48:36] twisted away from it because there's
[48:38] something on the inside that's more real
[48:40] than anything on the outside faith is
[48:43] the substance of things hoped for what
[48:45] kind of a substance is it it's a holy
[48:48] ghost substance a substance with some
[48:50] power in it some holding power faith is
[48:53] the substance of things hoped for the
[48:55] evidence of things
[48:57] not seen what kind of an evidence
[48:59] brother brown said he said a holy
[49:01] evidence a holy evidence that keeps you
[49:04] that keeps you from being turned away
[49:06] turned away by the things of this world
[49:08] it will keep you it'll keep you despite
[49:11] all the stuff they're putting on
[49:12] websites all this because you know that
[49:14] god is true it's a holy ghost substance
[49:17] a holy ghost evidence a holy ghost faith
[49:20] is what's been holding you oh holy ghost
[49:22] faith is what's been keeping you the
[49:24] holy ghost is what has done it
[49:28] and that's that's what gives you faith
[49:31] that's that's faith
[49:32] holy ghost faith whether you've been
[49:34] born again and god has given you his
[49:36] faith and placed that faith himself in
[49:38] your soul now you've got a faith that
[49:41] can believe without having to contact
[49:43] something where you don't need to go
[49:45] through a prayer line and have somebody
[49:47] lay hands on you you don't need to have
[49:49] somebody touch you but faith is the
[49:51] thing that it does distance does not
[49:53] matter is what brother ram said and he
[49:55] told that story of the centurion where
[49:57] he said i'm not worthy he told jesus i'm
[49:59] not worthy that you come under my roof
[50:02] just speak the word and what was it he
[50:04] said faith is the thing that closes the
[50:07] difference distance between the prayer
[50:09] that you ask and the god that's there to
[50:11] answer faith is the thing that connects
[50:15] faith changes things from here to here
[50:17] if distance doesn't matter circumstances
[50:20] don't matter all those things don't
[50:22] matter to faith so when he said when
[50:23] they make a phone call and say pray that
[50:26] contact
[50:27] and your faith brings god
[50:30] your faith brings god
[50:32] it's the thing that brings the prayer
[50:33] and god together on the scene prayer
[50:36] faith changes
[50:38] from here to here faith is the thing
[50:41] that changes from the person praying
[50:44] from the circle to the circumstance it's
[50:46] the thing that connect it brings it
[50:47] together all christianity all you are
[50:50] all you'll ever be is based upon faith
[50:53] in the word and that's what the reason i
[50:55] believe the word
[50:57] first you must be born again
[50:59] in other words get a foundation laid
[51:02] i know we're taking our time this
[51:03] afternoon i'm not going to hold you that
[51:04] long
[51:05] you know i know i know what y'all think
[51:07] when i when i say y'all like he got to
[51:09] go through all these virtues
[51:13] i'm not i'm not going to hold you too
[51:14] long
[51:17] but you got
[51:18] you got to you got to lay the foundation
[51:20] you remember that story brother i'm told
[51:21] of the sydney harbor bridge being laid
[51:23] and everybody said you can't lay a
[51:25] bridge there you can't stretch a spam
[51:27] between these two places but a man came
[51:29] on the scene and said i can do it how
[51:31] did he do it he got he got a blower and
[51:34] he blew all the sand under from
[51:36] underwear he was they were going to dig
[51:37] that bridge and he got down and he dug
[51:39] and he dug and he dug and he dug and he
[51:41] dug until he hit rock and when he hit
[51:43] the foundation then he was able to
[51:45] stretch the bridge and everybody said
[51:47] that bridge ain't going to stand
[51:48] everybody said that that ain't going to
[51:50] last this ain't going to stand but if
[51:52] you get the foundation right if you get
[51:54] the found in other words if you get born
[51:56] again then it'll stand the test and they
[51:58] drove all this long line of cars over
[52:01] the first day and everybody was standing
[52:03] around waiting to see that bridge fall
[52:05] but it stood the test now you compare
[52:07] that compare that going back over in the
[52:09] old testament where there was a man who
[52:12] who was going through some hard times by
[52:13] the name of jacob and it says in genesis
[52:16] 28 that he lied on a certain light it
[52:18] upon a certain place
[52:20] and tear it there all night because the
[52:22] sun was set and he took of the stones of
[52:24] that place and he and put them for his
[52:26] pillars in other words he laid his head
[52:28] on a stone he found a place where he
[52:30] could lay his head and rest he found a
[52:32] rock something solid and that night god
[52:35] gave him a vision and he dreamed and
[52:37] behold a ladder set up on the earth and
[52:39] the top of it reached to heaven and
[52:41] behold the angels of god ascending and
[52:43] descending on it he got a little glimpse
[52:45] of the way the path up to the divine
[52:47] nature of god but he laid his head on a
[52:50] stone and until you lay your head on the
[52:52] rock of the revelation of jesus christ
[52:54] you don't have a foundation
[52:57] that's why jesus said therefore
[52:59] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[53:02] and doeth them i will liken him unto a
[53:04] wise man which built his house upon a
[53:07] rock
[53:08] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[53:12] that seems so simple it's so simple that
[53:15] you know many people overlook the
[53:16] simplicity of the the gospel is actually
[53:19] what will give you a foundation will
[53:22] give you the ability to escape the
[53:23] things
[53:24] i i wonder if people realized realize
[53:27] what what we come to church for that
[53:30] i think that's why the devil combats
[53:32] things in church he begins as soon as
[53:34] soon as you get to church you don't fall
[53:35] asleep during the singing you don't fall
[53:37] asleep on the drive to church but as
[53:39] soon as you get in the church the devil
[53:40] gets real mad because he knows that if
[53:42] you can get a revelation of jesus christ
[53:45] then you'll be an overcomer so what does
[53:47] he want to do he wants to put you to
[53:49] sleep that one time in your whole week
[53:51] that you should be you should be wide
[53:53] awake that you should be listening but
[53:54] that one time he'll he'll come over and
[53:57] he'll begin to sing a little lullaby in
[53:58] your ear or whatever's happening and
[54:00] he'll before long you you'll be
[54:03] in the arms of morpheus
[54:07] and missing out missing out may be on
[54:09] the thing that will give you overcoming
[54:11] power in this hour
[54:13] and see and then if you don't hear it in
[54:15] church where are you going to hear it
[54:17] you got to go study it out for yourself
[54:19] and pour over scriptures and ponder and
[54:21] things but we come to church to get
[54:23] edified we come to church to get the
[54:25] sword laid in our hands so we have
[54:27] something to fight with so we have
[54:28] something to pick our way out of the
[54:30] eggshell with
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:32] you know a little chick
[54:34] in his shell i doubt he's sleeping too
[54:36] much when it comes time for it to get
[54:37] out of that shell but it's like i gotta
[54:39] get out of here and it begins to get
[54:41] desperate it begins to know
[54:43] recognize where his help is gonna come
[54:45] from from that little mouth it begins to
[54:47] speak
[54:49] so what's the foundation of christianity
[54:51] faith in the word of god and everything
[54:53] is based on faith that's your foundation
[54:56] first pour your foundation faith
[54:59] that's the same thing in life
[55:00] that's why you know you tell you tell
[55:02] young people before you get married make
[55:04] sure your foundations you don't want to
[55:05] have a a bank account that the wind's
[55:07] blowing through you want to have a
[55:08] foundation
[55:10] you know you you want to have some
[55:11] things squared away because the
[55:12] foundation is important you don't want
[55:14] to just jump into life without
[55:16] many people do
[55:18] and you'll have that but but yet
[55:21] they're bound for trouble because
[55:23] because if you don't have the foundation
[55:25] laid square you
[55:26] any and everything both natural and
[55:28] spiritual lay the foundation first
[55:34] faith in the word of god
[55:36] that's your foundation then you begin to
[55:38] grow
[55:39] you begin to add to this foundation now
[55:40] let's go through these virtues real
[55:42] quick
[55:43] virtue virtue is the first thing you add
[55:46] and and brother brown said he quoted
[55:48] luke 6 9 and the whole merchant who
[55:50] sought to touch him for there went
[55:52] virtue out of him it went out of him if
[55:54] it went out of him it's got to go out of
[55:55] us and what is virtue strength or power
[55:58] in other words something on the inside
[56:00] that's holding you up something on the
[56:01] inside because the holy ghost is the
[56:02] thing that's doing it and so he said the
[56:05] virtue is as a past to let to let it
[56:07] pass out to others so that others can
[56:09] come and smell the odor can sniff and
[56:11] again get a benefit can be around you
[56:13] like like he said if if somebody comes
[56:15] around and they they look at somebody
[56:17] that says i'm a christian but yeah
[56:19] you're going around and doing things
[56:20] that you shouldn't
[56:22] you'll get funds no no funds available
[56:25] no virtue available because there's no
[56:27] power behind it no strength behind it no
[56:29] power no power of a life of a life of
[56:32] the life of christ behind it and there's
[56:34] i believe that there's power in the
[56:35] church today jesus gave us power
[56:39] power to cast out devils power power for
[56:41] a young holy ghost filled man that when
[56:43] he sees a woman maybe on the subway or
[56:45] something that's dressed scaly clad
[56:47] power for him to turn his head power for
[56:50] him to look for for a young man or a
[56:53] woman to look at to bypass things of the
[56:55] world to not go in the red dot store not
[56:58] go in the pornography store to to bypass
[57:01] because there's power in you power to
[57:03] live a christian life
[57:04] power to preach the gospel power to give
[57:06] somebody something that you've got and
[57:08] what what do you have that you can give
[57:10] somebody else you can give them the word
[57:12] because the word is the power that
[57:14] you've got that gives strength to
[57:15] somebody else
[57:16] power to live a christian life power to
[57:19] turn your head power to believe in
[57:21] miracles power to cast out devils
[57:25] you say brother said well that was a day
[57:27] from past we don't have it that means
[57:29] you don't have no virtue if you don't
[57:31] believe that that this miracle that the
[57:33] days of miracles are still here then
[57:35] there's there's no virtue you got
[57:37] something to give out
[57:38] and then he said you add knowledge
[57:40] knowledge now that don't mean worldly
[57:42] knowledge because that's foolishness to
[57:43] god but knowledge to judge judge what
[57:46] right from home in other words it ain't
[57:48] just information where you go into a
[57:50] self-help store and you just pile on it
[57:52] for a lot of people today they like
[57:54] information but this is this is holy
[57:56] ghost knowledge holy ghost virtue holy
[57:59] ghost faith and holy ghost knowledge to
[58:01] give you a revelation of the things that
[58:03] you've read the things that
[58:05] many people just look at you know the
[58:07] bible says that many many in second
[58:09] timothy it says ever learning ever
[58:11] learning and never able to come to the
[58:13] knowledge of the truth so a lot of
[58:15] learning is not what does it but
[58:17] learning
[58:18] receiving a revelation from god
[58:20] something that the holy ghost has given
[58:22] to you and brother said you must believe
[58:24] it this way you should believe today and
[58:26] accept it that the days of miracles has
[58:28] not passed to know that the days that
[58:32] miracles are acceptable to you
[58:34] knowledge that what god said god is able
[58:37] to perform knowing that he's still able
[58:39] to do it
[58:41] like abraham that yet against hope he
[58:43] believed in hope because he had
[58:45] knowledge that god was able to keep
[58:47] everything that he promised and where
[58:49] does knowledge come from knowledge comes
[58:51] from you eating the word until precept
[58:53] upon precept is added line up online
[58:55] until it's quickened to you and you know
[58:57] that god is the same yesterday today and
[58:59] forever and you know that all the
[59:01] hogwash they're saying on the internet
[59:03] about brother branham don't my mouth to
[59:04] a hill of beans because you know god
[59:07] because it came from the holy ghost it's
[59:09] not something that it's not you don't
[59:11] have a lot of information
[59:13] you you can't fight all the things that
[59:14] they're saying with a lot of information
[59:16] that's what people try to do they try to
[59:18] make videos full of information but what
[59:20] we need is a revelation of jesus christ
[59:24] when you see that the scripture is not
[59:25] contradictory that you can say that and
[59:27] see that by the revelation of god the
[59:29] whole word is wrote in mysteries and
[59:31] only the knowledge of god can reveal it
[59:33] that when you get and say punctuate
[59:34] every word of god with an amen then add
[59:37] that to your faith and then add
[59:39] temperance and tempers is the holy ghost
[59:41] in control the holy ghost to control at
[59:44] the beat so that when somebody slaps you
[59:46] or somebody says something wrong to you
[59:48] the holy oast is the one in control
[59:50] brother said how to control your tongue
[59:52] not be a tattler how to control your
[59:54] temper not fly off every time anybody
[59:56] speaks cross to you old temperance how
[59:58] to answer in kindness when wrath has
[1:00:00] spoke to you he said you're a bunch of
[1:00:02] holy rollers out there don't jump out
[1:00:04] and roll up your sleeves now see not
[1:00:06] that control he said now if you got it
[1:00:08] like that add it to your faith if you
[1:00:10] still blow up and sass and fuss and stew
[1:00:13] and carry on you ain't got no tempers if
[1:00:16] somebody somebody says something crossed
[1:00:18] to you and you just turn red in the face
[1:00:20] and your veins busting out in your neck
[1:00:22] you know there's something else that's
[1:00:23] got to be added but don't try to
[1:00:24] manufacture it but let the holy ghost do
[1:00:27] it because the holy ghost is the only
[1:00:29] thing that can change
[1:00:31] then after you've added tempers then
[1:00:32] after that add patience to your faith
[1:00:35] knowing this james said that the trying
[1:00:37] of your faith works with patience
[1:00:39] first thing is have patience with god
[1:00:41] and brother adam explained it like this
[1:00:43] the two things patience patience with
[1:00:45] god have patience with one another
[1:00:47] patience with god to know that if he
[1:00:49] said something he will bring it to pass
[1:00:51] patience like abraham waiting for him to
[1:00:54] bring that that promised son on the
[1:00:56] scene resting and waiting on god because
[1:00:58] you know that his word is true because
[1:01:00] it all comes from faith it's faith
[1:01:03] welling up on the inside coming up
[1:01:05] coming out knowing that god faith
[1:01:07] believed in god's word and if he said it
[1:01:09] he's going to bring it to pass and what
[1:01:11] kind of patience should we have in this
[1:01:13] hour with after all this time after all
[1:01:15] these years and it looks like he's
[1:01:17] delaying his coming but yet we have
[1:01:19] patience because we know that he's going
[1:01:22] to come and catch his waiting bride away
[1:01:25] say how well i asked him last night to
[1:01:27] heal me and i'm just as sick this
[1:01:28] morning oh my what patience noah waited
[1:01:31] patiently moses waited patiently when he
[1:01:34] threw that rod down and the other two
[1:01:36] fakers came up and they threw their rods
[1:01:38] down and brother said that typed jesus
[1:01:40] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:01:42] forever that heavens and earth will pass
[1:01:44] away but my word will never pass away
[1:01:47] moses standing there with confidence and
[1:01:49] patience believing we've got to have
[1:01:51] patience like that patience not not
[1:01:53] something we manufacture but holy ghost
[1:01:55] patience
[1:01:57] he said wait at all this time for a
[1:01:59] resurrection there'll be one don't worry
[1:02:01] god promised it and we should have
[1:02:03] patience with one another too and now
[1:02:07] now after you've got patience add
[1:02:08] godliness and what does godliness mean
[1:02:10] means to be like god you got way up here
[1:02:14] now before you're asked to do that all
[1:02:15] these things has to be added first he's
[1:02:17] asked to be perfect
[1:02:19] god in us sons and daughters of god in
[1:02:22] other words all the things that are
[1:02:23] after all the characteristics of god are
[1:02:26] wrapped up in your life and so when
[1:02:28] somebody strikes you in the face because
[1:02:30] you've got godliness this manifest in
[1:02:32] your life and you turn the other cheek
[1:02:34] he said ye are gods jesus said so why
[1:02:37] all the virtue all the things that's in
[1:02:39] god is in you all the things that's in
[1:02:42] god all the things all those are in you
[1:02:46] and you're manifesting in the life of
[1:02:48] god and he quote in matthew 5 48 that
[1:02:51] says be therefore perfect even as your
[1:02:53] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:02:55] that is it not written in your law john
[1:02:57] 10 34 i said ye are gods ye are gods
[1:03:01] that have the words come to you so if ye
[1:03:04] are gods it's because godliness is
[1:03:06] manifested in you
[1:03:10] godly always looking for one thing
[1:03:13] always looking for one thing i always do
[1:03:15] that which pleases the father see yes
[1:03:17] sir always that's godliness godliness is
[1:03:21] to always do that which pleases the
[1:03:23] father and then sixth let's add the
[1:03:25] bible said here brotherly kindness
[1:03:27] brotherly kindness now after you've got
[1:03:29] godliness now
[1:03:31] look through your brother's eyes
[1:03:32] put your plus self in his place look
[1:03:35] that when he does something that you
[1:03:36] don't like or maybe maybe he doesn't
[1:03:38] come to the company go out to eat with
[1:03:40] you or
[1:03:41] put all the different things in place
[1:03:43] well maybe he gets sick or whatever you
[1:03:44] begin to put yourself in his place and
[1:03:47] look through his eyes put brother baby
[1:03:48] said put yourself at his place on the
[1:03:51] matter have patience with him have
[1:03:54] patience with him and deal with him
[1:03:55] brotherly kindness you see a brother is
[1:03:57] all out of tune don't be impatient with
[1:04:00] him be kind to him go anyhow hoping
[1:04:03] someday being patient with and enduring
[1:04:05] with him to understand what he believes
[1:04:08] it's in his heart that's what is virtue
[1:04:10] in yourself to let it go out with
[1:04:12] kindness meekness to him having faith
[1:04:14] that someday
[1:04:15] god will bring him in
[1:04:18] remembering in his heart he is a
[1:04:20] believer now there's brotherly kindness
[1:04:22] when somebody makes a little slip up or
[1:04:24] whatever you remember that's a believer
[1:04:27] that's my brother and you're looking at
[1:04:29] that brother differently now because
[1:04:31] you're not looking at him knowing that
[1:04:32] that's a believer it's not not just
[1:04:34] somebody out there on the street or
[1:04:36] something that's my brother that's my
[1:04:38] brother or sister and you begin to treat
[1:04:40] that brother or sister differently
[1:04:41] because you know you know you're you're
[1:04:43] part of the same body you're part of the
[1:04:46] same family you're part of the same
[1:04:47] family of god it don't matter what their
[1:04:49] skin color is or where they come from
[1:04:51] where their background was what kind of
[1:04:53] life they had they might have been like
[1:04:54] rahab or whatever but that's your
[1:04:56] brother and you love them brotherly
[1:04:58] kindness
[1:05:00] the holy ghost is what does it mean the
[1:05:02] holy ghost is what changes the holy
[1:05:04] ghost is the only thing that can make
[1:05:06] you look like look at somebody like that
[1:05:09] where you begin to ignore over like the
[1:05:11] bible says love is what covers over a
[1:05:13] multitude of sins love is the thing that
[1:05:16] covers love love just kind of bypass
[1:05:19] when somebody wrongs you you begin to
[1:05:20] look through eyes of love
[1:05:22] brother i'm said feeling for your
[1:05:23] brother
[1:05:25] and he said if what is supposed to the
[1:05:27] church what is purpose to the church the
[1:05:29] life that was in christ isn't reflected
[1:05:31] in you
[1:05:32] don't you stand still
[1:05:34] if you haven't got patience virtue all
[1:05:36] these things and temperance and things
[1:05:38] in godliness and brotherly kindness and
[1:05:40] all these things that's required of you
[1:05:42] no matter what you've done
[1:05:44] no matter how much you've shouted how
[1:05:46] many churches you've joined how many
[1:05:48] feathers you've penned into yourself
[1:05:50] don't do it wait till genuinely from
[1:05:52] your heart you can forgive till in your
[1:05:54] heart you have brotherly kindness no
[1:05:56] matter if they pull a handful of beard
[1:05:58] from one side you can turn the other
[1:06:00] cheek with sweetnessy until all those
[1:06:03] virtues no matter what they say to you
[1:06:05] do you realize what kind of a church it
[1:06:07] would be and i i speak positively i
[1:06:09] believe we're coming to a place like
[1:06:11] that i i believe like like the brother
[1:06:13] was preaching on sunday we're we're not
[1:06:15] preaching necessarily to what we look at
[1:06:17] but to what god's word says we are
[1:06:20] that's that's what we
[1:06:22] god made a way for it and i believe
[1:06:24] we're coming to a place
[1:06:26] where where where the devil won't know
[1:06:28] what to do with us do you realize what
[1:06:29] you would be if you come to that full
[1:06:31] stature of a church that where one
[1:06:34] individual is not trying to put
[1:06:35] themselves up above the other where
[1:06:37] people love one another
[1:06:38] despite all the offenses and things that
[1:06:41] that maybe come just because of life
[1:06:43] because of all the misunderstandings but
[1:06:45] you love one another and put up with one
[1:06:47] another and are patient and kind and he
[1:06:49] said you've never seen a sweeter kind or
[1:06:52] gentler person that's got all these
[1:06:54] virtues in him but it's what god
[1:06:56] requires
[1:06:57] god requires how does he require it why
[1:07:00] does he require it for what purpose so
[1:07:02] that we can get out of here
[1:07:04] that's why it's required it's required
[1:07:07] and there should be something yearning
[1:07:08] in your heart tonight i believe that you
[1:07:10] to be swallowed up with him knowing that
[1:07:12] it's not something that you can
[1:07:14] manufacture something that you can
[1:07:16] produce yourself but it's only by the
[1:07:19] holy ghost the holy ghost is the one
[1:07:21] that does it the holy ghost is the only
[1:07:23] way
[1:07:24] and now after all these things then
[1:07:26] we'll add charity after after that at
[1:07:28] charity and paul said i can have all
[1:07:30] understand all mysteries have all
[1:07:32] knowledge have all these things but yet
[1:07:34] without charity without love i am
[1:07:36] nothing and love is the thing that mixed
[1:07:39] in when you talk to somebody it's got to
[1:07:41] be in love makes everything win with
[1:07:43] love because love is that love is the
[1:07:45] holy ghost love is the holy ghost that's
[1:07:47] waves coming down that powers the whole
[1:07:50] thing drawing us up to the capstone
[1:07:53] he said it never was put on the pyramid
[1:07:55] they couldn't understand why the
[1:07:56] catholic stone was rejected the head
[1:07:58] christ but he said it will come someday
[1:08:02] it will come someday and i believe he
[1:08:04] was looking back then to look into the
[1:08:06] future but i believe now we're looking
[1:08:08] to a present tense why because it's been
[1:08:10] loosed it's been opened up the way is
[1:08:14] accessible the the the seals have been
[1:08:17] open and when the seals are open now the
[1:08:20] ministry has been loosed so that we can
[1:08:22] pre we've got something to preach and
[1:08:24] what are we preaching that god has come
[1:08:26] to tabernacle himself in you god the
[1:08:28] minister the musicians can come forward
[1:08:30] god has come god has made a way that god
[1:08:33] can tabernacle himself and you can can
[1:08:36] sow and develop you and swallow you up
[1:08:38] in himself until you don't even see you
[1:08:40] anymore
[1:08:42] and it's by the holy ghost
[1:08:44] it's what the holy ghost has done
[1:08:46] not we ourselves the holy ghost is the
[1:08:49] one that's
[1:08:50] done brother branham at the end of that
[1:08:52] sermon he said i pledged this morning to
[1:08:54] him with all my heart
[1:08:56] that by his help and by his grace
[1:08:58] i pray that i'll seek daily without
[1:09:00] ceasing until i feel every one of these
[1:09:03] requirements flowing in this little old
[1:09:05] stature of mine until i can be a
[1:09:07] manifestation of the living christ i
[1:09:08] wonder if that's our prayer this
[1:09:10] afternoon as we stand to our feet

[1:09:17] of gravity by lifting up your hand and
[1:09:18] say that's my desire tonight lord god i
[1:09:21] want to be so swallowed up in you until
[1:09:23] the holy ghost is filling me with every
[1:09:25] one of these virtues so that i can be a
[1:09:28] living eye to a living tabernacle of a
[1:09:30] living god
[1:09:31] to prove that he's not dead but he's
[1:09:33] alive alive in me
