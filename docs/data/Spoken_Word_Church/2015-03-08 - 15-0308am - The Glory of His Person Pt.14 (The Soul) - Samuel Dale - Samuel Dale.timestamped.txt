[4:14] them up where we've been reading in
[4:15] Revelations 1. then we'll go to Genesis
[4:20] 1 and then we'll go to Genesis 2.
[4:27] Revelations 1 Genesis 1 and Revelation
[4:30] and Genesis 2.
[4:32] we had a real good time last night at
[4:34] the Bible study you know and if you want
[4:37] to listen to it we have the tapes
[4:39] available but we're still in the Book of
[4:41] Romans
[4:42] but we did get over into at least a
[4:45] seventh chapter last night and trying to
[4:47] finish it up you know the Paul where
[4:50] Paula things I would not I do not know
[4:52] and all of the things are in in the
[4:55] scripture that had a good time remember
[4:58] the fellowship meeting now will be the
[4:59] third Saturday 3 30. remember brother
[5:02] Matthew Bray will be preaching that and
[5:05] at least the morning service following
[5:07] on Sundays or remember those things and
[5:11] uh
[5:12] if you need a place to stay or whatever
[5:14] make sure you talk to somebody or
[5:17] whatever for the uh you know the time of
[5:21] of doing that to where we can you don't
[5:23] have to drive back home
[5:25] and I remember brother now remember
[5:27] brother Gibby he's down at his brothers
[5:29] remember him and remember his brother
[5:31] also
[5:33] that's about all the announcements I
[5:35] think that we have seemed like
[5:37] but anyhow
[5:38] Genesis 1
[5:40] Revelation 1 Genesis 1 and then Genesis
[5:43] 2. the heavenly father we thank you for
[5:45] this day in your grace and your love
[5:47] thank you for all things because you
[5:51] give them to us freely
[5:52] Lord then we just thank you and we ask
[5:55] you to just help us
[5:57] we know we're not worthy to receive
[6:00] anything from you
[6:01] but yet you made us worthy so there's
[6:04] where the thing is that as long as we
[6:07] rest in you just have your way be with
[6:09] us today in the service and bless
[6:11] remember the sick among us and just come
[6:14] and and Deliver Us Lord from destruction
[6:17] heave our bodies and help us to walk in
[6:20] you God each and every one of us and
[6:22] keep us in Jesus name
[6:24] amen
[6:26] Revelations
[6:31] that Wade was doing great I think they
[6:33] said
[6:34] 600 I believe they said was in a meeting
[6:36] last night so he's doing great in moving
[6:40] along you know yeah
[6:43] Revelations 1 12.
[6:46] says and I turned to see the voice that
[6:48] spoke with me and being turned I saw
[6:51] seven golden candlesticks
[6:53] and in the midst of the seven
[6:55] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[6:57] man clothed with a garment down to the
[6:59] foot and gird about the pouch with a
[7:01] golden girdle
[7:03] all right let's go over to revela to
[7:05] Genesis 1 now
[7:07] and read
[7:10] you know
[7:12] 26 and 27 and then we'll go to Genesis
[7:15] 2.
[7:18] and God said let us make man in our
[7:20] image after our likeness and let them
[7:23] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[7:25] and over the fall of the air and over
[7:27] the cattle and over all the Earth
[7:30] an over ever creeping thing that
[7:32] creepeth upon the Earth
[7:34] so God created man in his own image in
[7:36] the image of God created he him or it's
[7:39] the male and female created he them all
[7:44] right
[7:45] if we get this far we'll go over to
[7:47] Genesis 2 and 4.
[7:50] these are the generations of the heavens
[7:52] and of the earth when they were created
[7:54] in the day that the Lord God made the
[7:56] earth and the heavens and ever planted a
[8:00] field before it was in the Earth
[8:02] and every herb of the field before it
[8:05] grew for the Lord God had not caused it
[8:08] to Reign upon the Earth and there was no
[8:11] man to till the ground
[8:13] but there went out of mist upon the
[8:15] Earth and watered the whole face of the
[8:17] ground
[8:18] and the Lord God formed man of the Dust
[8:21] of the ground
[8:23] and breathed into his nostrils the
[8:26] breath of life and he became a living
[8:29] Soul that's going down
[8:33] and the Lord God planted a garden
[8:35] Eastward in Eden and there he put the
[8:38] man whom he had formed amen you may be
[8:41] seated Lord had his Blessing to the
[8:44] reading of the word
[8:45] now you don't try to blow your nose or
[8:47] do anything for me today I'm having
[8:49] enough trouble
[8:51] all right I have to
[8:54] do that so if it takes it we puff and
[8:59] puff all right
[9:02] but now we've been talking now for quite
[9:04] a while
[9:05] about
[9:07] how real is God
[9:10] you know
[9:11] and I hope that we have
[9:14] uh been able to plant enough
[9:18] thoughts and ideas about God in his ways
[9:21] and his doing and you know to be able to
[9:25] comprehend in how real he is
[9:29] and remember if we are
[9:31] if we were created of him then he would
[9:34] have to be a whole lot greater than we
[9:36] are
[9:37] because he brought us into being we
[9:39] didn't bring him into being
[9:41] but to bring it down that he's real that
[9:44] he's not like the wind just blowing
[9:47] the Bible says he's Spirit that's fine
[9:50] because then he goes on the prophet to
[9:53] explain that he's a spiritual being
[9:56] he's not just like the wind so it's not
[9:59] to just say well he's just a spirit
[10:01] just floating about and had no form or
[10:04] no no doings you know because the wind
[10:06] has no form to it
[10:08] like it's just blowing and going but
[10:12] he's he is uh even so much a being that
[10:17] he is not
[10:18] omnipresent in the way that we use the
[10:21] word omnipresent
[10:24] because omnipresent means to be ever
[10:27] present
[10:28] and he's not that away because he's a
[10:30] being
[10:31] all right now we've been through those
[10:33] things trying to cover how real
[10:36] that God really is
[10:39] and I hope that I put in enough this is
[10:41] about probably 10 messages at least on
[10:45] that point alone to try to get us to
[10:49] follow the line and see how real and
[10:51] what what we've been trying to talk
[10:53] about
[10:55] all right then we read here in
[10:58] Genesis
[11:00] that this great creator that great God
[11:04] the one that we talked about as being
[11:06] the the all-sufficient one the all
[11:09] things and and how that uh
[11:13] he was so much a being until he was
[11:17] counted to be as a person
[11:20] because you wouldn't count just a spirit
[11:23] as a wind blowing to be a person you
[11:26] would you would try to keep it more or
[11:27] less just floating around but he's real
[11:30] but we've been on it now a couple of
[11:33] services tying together the two of man
[11:36] God coming into being that we can
[11:38] comprehend him and then man coming into
[11:42] being so that we can comprehend what we
[11:45] are he said well we know what we are
[11:47] well that's good you know but do we
[11:50] really know what we are
[11:53] you know can you explain it as job would
[11:56] say
[11:57] you remember that
[12:00] The Book of Job he may he job was a very
[12:03] smart man but God questioned him a good
[12:05] bit about it
[12:07] you know in saying where were you when
[12:09] this happened what was this what was
[12:10] that you know he was uh he kept trying
[12:15] to emphasize that we really don't know
[12:17] what's going on where were we when the
[12:19] foundation of the world was laid what
[12:21] was the doing see we wouldn't we we
[12:23] can't comprehend those things
[12:26] But as God begins to unfold himself to
[12:30] you and I then we would begin to
[12:33] understand who we are and what we're
[12:37] doing and and you know the things of
[12:39] Life all right and we've come over to
[12:42] the point of talking about that
[12:46] you know
[12:47] God was the first creation not that God
[12:50] created himself neither did he create
[12:53] another person or another Identity or
[12:57] anything to come into being as a second
[13:00] person
[13:02] so it's really just human terminologies
[13:05] because that's all we can use to express
[13:08] but it's really talking about him coming
[13:12] in to understanding to the human mind
[13:17] that where we can comprehend a little
[13:20] bit about God and His doings all right
[13:22] and then we came down to where that it
[13:25] would would be that mankind then
[13:29] is we're going to try to pick up today
[13:31] and move a little bit is how real are
[13:36] you
[13:38] that's been our thought a couple of
[13:40] services really how real are you
[13:42] or what is the real you
[13:46] know
[13:47] if it's true about the the point that we
[13:51] can and I believe it is that uh you know
[13:54] you can't destroy the soul but you can
[13:58] destroy the body
[14:00] so then the Soul is more real than the
[14:02] body
[14:04] all right because it will live on after
[14:07] the body is annihilated you know as far
[14:10] as could be blown Smithereens and find
[14:13] nothing of it you know but yet still the
[14:16] soul of mankind will live on somewhere
[14:18] all right so the soul is the real you
[14:21] brother random says on you must be born
[14:24] again he said what is the soul he says
[14:29] it's you
[14:31] you are a soul
[14:34] all right now then what we want to do
[14:37] now for a while is talk about at least a
[14:40] couple of services about how real that
[14:43] is and to think about it
[14:46] and then to get away from the point of
[14:49] us just being some form of this or that
[14:52] or the other or you know we're we're the
[14:55] highest form of animal right in physical
[14:57] creation right but in spiritual creation
[15:00] we are in the image of God
[15:03] all right now I want to deal with that
[15:06] quite at length to make sure that you
[15:10] understand what I'm saying
[15:12] it's not that I'm trying to convince you
[15:15] of it because there would be no way for
[15:17] me to do that anyway I cannot convince
[15:20] you and I cannot reveal it to you I can
[15:24] only speak of the things and let God
[15:27] then speak to you and you know reveal
[15:30] himself to you all right now I want to
[15:34] kind of make it a split condition this
[15:36] morning so bear with me and I'll try to
[15:39] to make sure you know which side I'm
[15:42] split on all right you know which side
[15:44] I'm talking about
[15:47] but see when you read that it says it
[15:49] that
[15:51] Man was created in the image of God
[15:55] all right
[15:57] now
[16:00] we'll get to it in a little bit to prove
[16:02] more about it as a point but
[16:05] that is not the making of mankind
[16:10] I'll prove that in a minute by just a
[16:13] simple little statement the Lord willing
[16:15] but I want you to think about it
[16:18] I want you to think about that even as
[16:21] we'll read Even in our fallen estate
[16:25] you know
[16:27] Fallen condition of mankind
[16:30] that it's amazing what he is
[16:34] because he's he's in a realm of
[16:38] above the animals that the animals
[16:40] cannot reason and do I know you can
[16:43] teach your dog to talk
[16:45] but I will ask you and see I like to say
[16:48] these things uh I'm not a smart alec
[16:51] maybe not smart but an elik or something
[16:54] about it but
[16:55] I like to make statements for you will
[16:58] think
[17:00] now you take a baby
[17:03] it's brought into the world
[17:06] you don't have to go every day to that
[17:08] baby and say hey baby hey baby say this
[17:11] say daddy say mama it helps right okay
[17:14] fine
[17:16] but you know after a while if you just
[17:18] leave the baby alone you know it'll
[17:21] start talking
[17:22] right
[17:24] but you got a dog or a cat or something
[17:27] you got to constantly pound them about
[17:31] say this or do this or do that and I'll
[17:33] reward you to do that and I'll do that
[17:35] see
[17:37] because that animal can't think
[17:40] it works off a reaction from you
[17:43] you know
[17:45] and you say okay now
[17:48] now horse I'm going to touch you with my
[17:50] right hand
[17:53] well
[17:54] it doesn't know anything about right
[17:57] hand it'll never know anything about
[17:59] right hand it just knows which one you
[18:01] raise
[18:03] but the baby after so long it finds out
[18:06] this is the right hand
[18:07] you know by hearing interacting I know
[18:10] that but get the point what I'm saying
[18:12] you don't have to train a baby
[18:15] necessarily to talk it learns to talk
[18:19] because it's listening to you all right
[18:22] but that animal is listening to you all
[18:24] the time and it don't train him
[18:26] all right well because he doesn't have a
[18:30] soul
[18:31] you've got to make him repetitive
[18:33] repetitively repetitively repetitive and
[18:35] keep it going but think of that just as
[18:38] a point of understanding we know that an
[18:41] animal does not have a soul but a human
[18:43] being he has a soul
[18:46] or is a soul is a better way to say
[18:49] because that's his point of what he is
[18:51] but now
[18:54] think with me
[18:55] about the point that we're trying to
[18:58] make
[18:59] man
[19:02] he's he's an amazing thing
[19:06] you just think about what we've went in
[19:09] our lifetime
[19:12] when we when I started as a child you
[19:14] know we went within just a few years you
[19:17] just make outlandish leaps in
[19:20] intelligence
[19:23] you know and no matter if you think how
[19:25] smart your computer is remember the
[19:28] computer was designed by someone smarter
[19:33] than the computer
[19:35] the computer can't think you say yes it
[19:37] does no you give it five choices it's
[19:40] going to answer one of them it's not
[19:42] thinking it has no ability to do that
[19:45] all right it gives you choices and
[19:48] things to go with it but remember no
[19:51] matter how smart you think that computer
[19:52] really is
[19:55] somebody made it
[19:57] and the person that made it is smarter
[19:59] than that and that's why kind of like
[20:01] man does you know I remember reading one
[20:04] time they say about you know
[20:06] when they go to Michael
[20:08] uh down at the house and send it and the
[20:10] things you know and they go to make a
[20:12] law
[20:13] well by the time they get the law
[20:15] finished
[20:17] somebody sitting there has already
[20:19] figured out how to break that legally
[20:22] and get by with it right
[20:25] because that's the mankind all right
[20:28] but now think about it let's think in
[20:30] two ways now
[20:32] first off let's think about just mankind
[20:37] just people mankind
[20:42] is created in the image of God in the
[20:44] bases that he's a little creator
[20:48] he can do things he cannot create
[20:52] but he can take what he has and change
[20:55] it and use it and make it work
[20:59] now not because he's a Christian
[21:03] but because he is a person a being a
[21:07] soul as we would call it a life all
[21:11] right
[21:12] and it's really you know let's see what
[21:14] does it say in Genesis uh that something
[21:17] to the degree that he had to put him out
[21:19] of the garden uh you know because no the
[21:22] the imagination of man's heart mind is
[21:24] continually evil see it keeps on going
[21:27] and going and and doing but that's what
[21:31] I want you to think about
[21:33] and we got a couple of quotes that I
[21:34] want you to to use you know and I want
[21:37] to stay with that point to where that we
[21:39] can follow it but go ahead and pull up
[21:41] number one which is questions and
[21:43] answers in 1954. so let's think about
[21:47] just this man now your mind is supposed
[21:49] to be staying with me as to think about
[21:52] just mankind
[21:55] all right
[21:56] just human just humans
[21:59] all over the world there's seven billion
[22:01] something human beings
[22:04] and all of them to be a human being it
[22:07] takes you to have a body a spirit and a
[22:10] soul
[22:11] to make the human being because that's
[22:13] the the point of it but look what he's
[22:15] just saying
[22:16] he's talking about in the beginning that
[22:18] God made man in his own image is that
[22:20] right then what is God he's a spirit man
[22:22] and we come on down we got through to
[22:25] going through if God made Man In His
[22:26] Image what kind of a man did he make
[22:28] then a spirit man
[22:30] but in Genesis 2 there was no man to
[22:32] till the soul and God made Man Out of
[22:33] the Dust of the Earth
[22:35] not in His image because his flesh man's
[22:38] not made in His image it's in the animal
[22:40] image right come on
[22:43] but in the image of animal life and he
[22:46] put the spirit of man in this animal man
[22:49] here and he became a living Soul all
[22:54] right pull it on up to a point that we
[22:56] want to get to
[22:59] but he's got a soul he's talking about
[23:01] the dumb brute beast and all that they
[23:03] don't have a soul he's talking about man
[23:05] having a soul
[23:08] he's got a soul of God in him what makes
[23:10] him immortal
[23:12] and he can invent look what he can do
[23:14] he's on almost on the equal with God
[23:17] because he's the son of God even in his
[23:21] Fallen estate he's wonderful
[23:24] all right
[23:26] even in his Fallen estate
[23:29] it's wonderful
[23:30] all right he goes on into speaking of
[23:34] the in the message Fellowship I'll just
[23:37] quote these
[23:38] he can build a better house a better way
[23:41] of living better clothes even in his
[23:44] Fallen estate he's still the son of God
[23:47] Fallen
[23:48] why because God is his creator
[23:51] right it don't matter who it is
[23:55] Mama and Daddy might get a body
[23:58] but it takes somebody else to get the
[24:00] soul in the spirit all right now so then
[24:04] he once he he goes on to the inside and
[24:07] saying
[24:08] he gives him attributes to do something
[24:11] to bring himself back to a place trying
[24:14] to where something inside of him tells
[24:17] him
[24:18] that he come from
[24:20] so no matter what about Mankind
[24:24] that mankind
[24:26] you know you go through the to the
[24:28] jungles of Africa you'd go to the North
[24:31] Pole you go to where you want to go
[24:32] where there's no Harley human
[24:35] civilization and a lot of it but yet
[24:37] still those people are worshiping
[24:41] that worship a totem pole they worship
[24:43] an animal they'll worship one because
[24:46] they know that they came from somewhere
[24:49] all right so then man in himself is a
[24:52] marvelous thing
[24:54] all right just a natural man human
[24:57] mankind all around the world look what
[25:00] he's come up with in the past 100 years
[25:03] see I mean I'm I'm 74 and in 50 years of
[25:09] my lifetime
[25:12] say the first 50.
[25:14] it went from so that would be about
[25:16] 1990. see it went from a horse and buggy
[25:21] to an astronaut
[25:23] within a 50-year period and look what
[25:26] it's done since then
[25:28] see no wonder it says its imagination of
[25:31] man's mind or heart you know is
[25:33] continually evil it's it's something
[25:36] within him but in one respect he's
[25:39] wanting to try to
[25:43] get back where he come from it's a
[25:45] prophet said because he realizes there's
[25:47] got to be a creator
[25:50] you know no matter what you want to say
[25:52] you say well there's atheists that don't
[25:55] believe in a God that's idiots
[25:58] all right now you tell me any other word
[26:01] to call them
[26:02] because if you don't believe I mean if
[26:05] you believe you're a human being
[26:07] then you come from somewhere
[26:09] I don't care what you want to run it
[26:11] back to as a pollywog or a frog or or
[26:14] whatever or or to bring it back to
[26:17] energy
[26:18] and this happened and that happened
[26:20] we're worded all of that come from
[26:23] no matter what we say or do it's going
[26:25] to run right back to the point that
[26:27] there has to be a Creator so if you
[26:30] don't believe that there is a God you
[26:32] must believe that you're that God
[26:35] well what's going to happen when you
[26:37] disappear
[26:40] does the world end because you
[26:43] you know you don't believe in it all
[26:46] right
[26:47] well see think about that
[26:51] that mankind
[26:53] in his worst estate he still
[26:57] has that image part of him
[27:00] that contacts him with the Creator
[27:05] you know all right
[27:07] now that's part one
[27:10] okay but it said two parts
[27:13] but part two
[27:15] this man that we talk of in Genesis 1 26
[27:18] and 27
[27:20] is not mankind
[27:27] do you want me to go ahead and say it
[27:28] now or do you want to wait a while and
[27:30] think about how dumb I am and try to run
[27:33] it out or do you want to you want to
[27:35] just get to Point up front
[27:38] all right we'll put the point up front
[27:42] had you ever thought about this man of
[27:44] Genesis 1 26 and 27
[27:48] was male and female
[27:51] right
[27:52] right you agree with that right
[27:57] I wish you had them
[27:59] because you trap Yourself by agreeing
[28:01] with it
[28:02] all right
[28:05] now you tell me Manning it is natural
[28:08] estate
[28:09] as man and woman
[28:15] um
[28:17] when I come into the world I didn't come
[28:19] into the world with male and female
[28:23] they may be some twists and perked up
[28:26] things or problems but Naturally
[28:29] Speaking all right
[28:33] Peggy wasn't in me
[28:37] right
[28:41] all right
[28:45] see if anything we came in the woman's
[28:47] side
[28:49] because we were in our mothers
[28:52] right but I still don't make us that one
[28:54] does it you understand what I'm getting
[28:56] at
[28:57] so I like to look at things like that I
[29:00] was you know writing notes and then then
[29:02] I just sit back and
[29:04] I read over those notes and I read over
[29:06] and I'll read them and I change them and
[29:08] I move them and that's why they their
[29:10] brothers will look they'll see they'll
[29:12] be
[29:13] scratched out places and things on my
[29:16] notes that I move that up to here and
[29:18] nobody don't follow me in my cut and
[29:21] tape anyway but
[29:24] but then after a while I get a thought
[29:27] and I thought oh Lord thank you
[29:31] now was any of you
[29:34] in your beginning male and female
[29:42] was your wife in you
[29:50] right
[29:52] well see that's where people get all
[29:54] these things you know when they think
[29:55] about these soul mateings and all of
[29:57] this you know and there's doctrines of
[30:00] that idea evidently must be a lot of
[30:02] them in the message because it sure is a
[30:03] lot of polygamy in the message people
[30:06] but
[30:08] do you understand my point
[30:11] mankind was not created male and female
[30:16] I said mankind
[30:22] right
[30:24] is that enough to solve the problem
[30:26] I'll quote that I've got it circled a
[30:28] good many times throughout the message
[30:30] to repeat it for you to think about it
[30:34] but this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 and
[30:38] over into verse 28.
[30:40] he is a very special man because he is
[30:43] created male and female
[30:49] he's created as we'll get to it later in
[30:52] the message not today
[30:54] that brother Branham said Eve was in
[30:57] Adam and theophany
[30:59] in the original creation of
[31:02] do it and said Eve was in Adam in the
[31:05] physical
[31:08] all right
[31:09] so then the 126 man is not just the
[31:13] creating of mankind
[31:18] because if it was then worse you may on
[31:20] female part today
[31:23] and I agree that some that act like look
[31:27] like male and act like female
[31:30] I go along with you but it still don't
[31:32] work
[31:36] but
[31:37] do you see my point
[31:40] even in his Fallen estate
[31:45] he is in the image of God
[31:50] because of being
[31:52] a person a human being a soul you know
[31:55] real
[31:57] and uh but then when you come to the
[32:00] creation there of Genesis 1 26. 27 then
[32:04] that must not be just all mankind
[32:11] that must be a special creation
[32:15] or else you've run aground
[32:18] all right
[32:20] let's read what the prophet had to say
[32:22] about this on questions and answer go
[32:24] ahead with number four
[32:29] no questions and answers in 1962.
[32:32] and look what he says
[32:36] he's talking about and Eve and now you
[32:39] know
[32:39] the wife and everything
[32:41] now notice in Genesis 1 21
[32:45] God created the whales in the sea
[32:49] he done everything and made the creation
[32:52] made man in his own image made man not a
[32:57] man whole man
[33:01] all of them in his own image
[33:04] see and after the image of God created
[33:07] he them male and female created him
[33:10] both like that
[33:13] all right now
[33:16] you can take that quote and
[33:21] make it say what you want it to say
[33:26] can you read it put it back up and let's
[33:27] look at it
[33:30] you can make that quote say what you
[33:31] want to make it say
[33:33] and that's the smartness of mankind with
[33:36] the ability
[33:37] but with the thought we just brought up
[33:41] to the point
[33:44] that all mankind could not be created
[33:47] male and female
[33:52] right
[33:54] Now read that with the thought
[34:00] made man in his own image made man not a
[34:04] man
[34:06] whole man
[34:08] all of them in His image
[34:11] as I said you can read that
[34:14] you can read that and say that God made
[34:16] man made man not a man he made whole man
[34:21] all of them in his own image
[34:24] you can read it
[34:28] but we're thinking about
[34:32] about be in the image of God
[34:34] because of the point of the male and
[34:37] female that this man was made
[34:42] now you've got to come back and think
[34:45] all right
[34:48] so we didn't make mankind
[34:51] in His image
[34:53] he made a man
[34:56] made man not a man he made a special
[35:00] person right there
[35:02] all right
[35:04] we know that this is in reality the
[35:07] creation of Adam
[35:11] that
[35:12] we'll get to it later that brother
[35:14] Branham said Eve was in Adam and
[35:16] theophany we'll get to that and try to
[35:18] divide it into a message
[35:22] but the main thing we want to do is look
[35:24] at it that
[35:26] let's just don't look at it then at all
[35:28] mankind
[35:31] in the image of God
[35:33] let's get down to find out who this is
[35:36] that he created
[35:39] all right
[35:41] so we can bring it to Adam for an
[35:44] example
[35:48] do you notice in the word I said Adam
[35:50] then you can be used as an example
[35:53] because he's the beginning of the
[35:55] creation of God in the natural part of
[35:59] mankind you know the first one
[36:03] all right now
[36:05] but this man has got to be a special man
[36:10] all right
[36:15] and
[36:16] if it's true the quotes that we read
[36:19] from the prophet
[36:22] that God is
[36:25] real
[36:27] that God is
[36:30] trying to condescend downward
[36:32] and that his first creation was himself
[36:36] not meaning that he created himself
[36:40] but meaning in Breaking that word down
[36:43] to understand that it means he simply
[36:46] came into being
[36:49] right
[36:51] not a creation
[36:53] right God who created who you remember
[36:56] the quotes we gave where the Prophet
[36:58] said people think multitudes think that
[37:01] God created Jesus and Jesus created
[37:03] everything else he said that's not true
[37:07] but we do know by the Bible
[37:10] of John 1 Hebrews 1 Colossians 1
[37:13] Ephesians 2 3 and 9 that Jesus Christ is
[37:18] the creator
[37:22] and we know when we used it there this
[37:24] past weekend about or this yeah
[37:28] about the uh
[37:32] man coming into being
[37:37] as being in the image of God and
[37:40] whatever God was
[37:42] that's what man would be
[37:45] or you're just trying to make something
[37:47] to look like
[37:51] you're using the word image as to
[37:53] something to look like
[37:56] well brother Brandon said Jesus was then
[37:59] very image of God
[38:02] now did you just look like him
[38:07] but then he turns around and what he
[38:09] says he said that he was either God
[38:12] or the biggest deceiver of this ever
[38:14] been
[38:16] all right
[38:19] so now if man is created in the image of
[38:22] that man
[38:24] that created him
[38:28] then with this man of Genesis 1 26 and
[38:31] 27 and going into verse 28 of course it
[38:33] goes into the two and
[38:35] would that be
[38:38] another person
[38:40] a separate person
[38:43] or the same person
[38:48] now brother Dale you're getting a little
[38:50] bit too close because you're talking a
[38:52] lot about making us be God well I
[38:54] thought that's what the Bible said
[38:58] that it was God's whom the word come to
[39:02] you know
[39:04] now we've got the quotient the prophet
[39:06] don't worry about it don't get run off
[39:07] and think well boy you're really messing
[39:09] up brother random said Adam was not the
[39:12] god of the of the heavens
[39:13] he was the god of the Earth
[39:16] we are not to be the god of Heaven he's
[39:19] the god of Heaven
[39:20] we are the god of the Earth
[39:22] and brother Brown said I long to see the
[39:24] time that these Sons and Daughters would
[39:27] come to realize
[39:31] that they're the gods of the Earth
[39:34] are you trying to control the heavens
[39:37] and the biggest part I'm not trying to
[39:39] control except one thing that's this
[39:42] part that you're looking at
[39:45] that ought to be my concern all right
[39:48] now
[39:49] so we covered stage one or thought one
[39:52] that
[39:54] human mankind
[39:57] because of who he is and the way he was
[40:00] brought into being
[40:01] that he's a wonderful person
[40:05] and constantly creating you know taking
[40:08] what we got putting it together making
[40:10] it going and doing building better
[40:12] houses building better cars and building
[40:14] you know Donnie likes to ride in his
[40:17] little way model
[40:19] but even he wouldn't want to take that
[40:21] 30-hour trip we took to Texas a couple
[40:24] of years ago in that little away model
[40:27] I don't think so
[40:30] you know I'd rather be up here a little
[40:32] bit more modern
[40:33] especially I want the air conditioning
[40:35] to work you know all right
[40:38] but see then that man being there would
[40:41] be all it's all right to talk about him
[40:43] as being in the image of God
[40:46] all right but it's really not speaking
[40:48] of him because like I said now
[40:52] if he's created in the image of this man
[40:55] the Bible emphatically States about four
[40:58] times
[41:00] three or four between 16 17 and 18.
[41:04] that this man was created male and
[41:07] female
[41:11] right
[41:13] and Mankind's not made that way
[41:16] so this is not the creation of just
[41:18] mankind
[41:20] this is the creation or coming into
[41:22] being of God in another form
[41:27] called a son
[41:31] because that Son of God was back before
[41:33] the foundation of the world
[41:36] what was he
[41:37] the Son of God was the Creator God
[41:40] that's even what Peter said see that we
[41:43] talk about there where he said Thou Art
[41:45] the Christ
[41:49] now he didn't just stop there he defined
[41:52] who he was speaking of and what Jesus
[41:55] was he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[41:58] of the Living God
[42:03] now the Bible doesn't call him God the
[42:05] son
[42:07] right that don't work because that goes
[42:10] into the wrong thing
[42:13] Peter was
[42:15] that Jesus was the one who created all
[42:19] things
[42:21] the Christ
[42:23] the son of the Living God
[42:27] not another person remember God came
[42:30] himself right
[42:33] he didn't send a son
[42:35] he came himself because if he sent a son
[42:38] that would be eternal sonships
[42:43] and we don't believe in that
[42:45] all right
[42:47] do you understand then this man must be
[42:50] something special
[42:53] of Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[42:58] and how that that man that was Dire
[43:07] that even Naturally Speaking
[43:10] Eve was in Adam
[43:14] right
[43:16] amen all right
[43:18] but I go back to the point now and I
[43:21] keep making it
[43:22] Peggy wasn't in me now that's
[43:25] uh
[43:33] now there's only one man that can be
[43:35] what you want to talk about
[43:39] and that's the man Christ Jesus
[43:45] because remember now
[43:52] go ahead and jump down a little bit
[43:54] let's pick up number eight
[43:56] if you will brother which is demonology
[43:58] Physical Realm 1953.
[44:02] but your souls were made up
[44:05] before the foundation of the world
[44:10] when God created man in his own image
[44:14] Spirit of man not a man in his own image
[44:20] right
[44:22] because the man this physical was made
[44:24] an image of animals all right
[44:26] but man in his own image
[44:30] see then he made them male and female
[44:33] before he'd ever had a man in the dust
[44:37] of the Earth
[44:38] wish we had a chance to explain that so
[44:40] then this man you're talking about
[44:45] was male and female in his original
[44:48] creation
[44:50] before the foundation of the world
[44:56] are you with me
[44:59] this soul that we talk about this being
[45:02] that we talk about in in in
[45:04] Genesis 1
[45:07] is not the physical creation of a body
[45:10] we know better than that right because
[45:12] we know that that Genesis 1 was a
[45:15] spiritual creation and we know that
[45:17] Genesis 2 is the physical creation
[45:22] all right Even Adam himself
[45:27] was made a very special person
[45:31] because even the point of the physical
[45:34] part
[45:36] you know
[45:38] in physical part Eve was in Adam
[45:43] right right
[45:45] took a rib made Eve now flesh of Flesh
[45:48] bone a bone you know
[45:52] he was a very special Creation in the
[45:54] beginning because he would be the
[45:55] beginning creation
[45:59] all right
[46:01] So Adam came here with Eve in him
[46:08] brother Brown says Jesus came here with
[46:10] us in him
[46:13] and we surely want to talk about that as
[46:16] a spiritual creation right
[46:18] not a physical
[46:21] but think about it
[46:25] think about what you're saying
[46:29] so this man that was created in the
[46:32] image of God
[46:33] is not a physical creation
[46:39] it is the spiritual creation
[46:43] which to me then means the same is that
[46:46] Jesus
[46:47] that God didn't create Jesus and Jesus
[46:50] create everything else Jesus was
[46:53] almighty God
[46:55] and back there when it came forth that's
[46:58] to create Torah remember it was like a
[47:01] little child playing before the father's
[47:04] door we gave those the other day and
[47:06] bringing it down
[47:09] and getting it to a point to see that
[47:13] Christ
[47:16] the word
[47:19] the logos feet
[47:21] word
[47:23] then is the creator
[47:27] all right all right
[47:29] and that's not a second person right
[47:35] right either Jesus was God made manifest
[47:37] or you and I have really got things
[47:40] messed up
[47:42] we better go find us a good Catholic and
[47:44] kiss the Pope's toe and forget the whole
[47:46] thing
[47:51] you say well you shouldn't make it like
[47:52] that well what's the difference
[47:55] you're gonna go find your good Baptist
[47:56] they just as messed up as the rest of
[47:58] them a good methodists or a good
[48:00] Pentecostal
[48:01] why not just go all the way back and
[48:03] kiss the old post hole and say Bud take
[48:05] care of this
[48:07] we don't believe that do we
[48:09] no we don't believe that
[48:12] well then we shouldn't believe a lot of
[48:14] the other things that we do
[48:17] and it shouldn't be confusing
[48:21] when we start talking about this that
[48:24] the condescending of God
[48:28] that he was coming down to the point of
[48:31] where he started to create and to do the
[48:33] things
[48:34] and that would be the the son of God
[48:38] the Creator
[48:41] well then Adam now let's bring up we'll
[48:43] get to quote in a little bit
[48:47] some was God's created son
[48:51] Jesus Was His only begotten son
[48:54] all right
[48:56] showing that Jesus the Christ not the
[48:59] flesh man
[49:01] would be the man that would create the
[49:04] Genesis 1 26 and 27 man or would be him
[49:07] in another form
[49:10] I think it's about time we
[49:13] rub out a little bit of our thoughts you
[49:15] know and say well
[49:16] you know you just look like you're
[49:18] getting a little bit too deep
[49:24] if you want your sugar tits go back
[49:26] where you come from
[49:28] and that's not sarcastic
[49:31] that's truth
[49:33] if that's what you want and that's what
[49:34] you want to follow
[49:36] I have no problems
[49:39] no building didn't get full by me going
[49:42] out and drumming up people on the side
[49:43] of the road to try to get them to come
[49:45] to church
[49:48] right
[49:50] but if you want to stay here and listen
[49:52] then let's talk about some things that
[49:54] have some understanding to it
[50:00] instead of whether we should wear
[50:01] pantyhose or whether we should wear
[50:04] two-toned shoes or
[50:09] you know
[50:11] let's get on with something to eat
[50:14] I love beans and taters
[50:17] I sure do I was raised on them but I
[50:21] also love a good steak
[50:24] but I don't want steak all the time
[50:27] I'm honest
[50:29] I'd prefer the beans and taters over the
[50:31] steak if you're going to try to make me
[50:33] on a a one-time you know that's all
[50:35] you're gonna get to eat well I wouldn't
[50:36] I'd take the beans and taters and let
[50:39] you have a steak because I wouldn't want
[50:40] your steak every day
[50:43] all right
[50:44] I love the simple things of God that we
[50:47] talk about but I think that there's
[50:50] nothing in God that's not simple right
[50:54] I think that's where our problem is
[50:57] we think it's deep
[51:00] but you know what it is because somebody
[51:02] brought out something that's contrary to
[51:04] your thinking
[51:08] now come on don't raise your hand don't
[51:10] smile
[51:13] but how many of you was thinking about
[51:15] that
[51:18] Genesis 1 26 would be basically all man
[51:29] but then I come up and say well now wait
[51:31] a minute if it's all manned then all we
[51:33] got to do is get that female out of that
[51:35] man see that my wife should have come
[51:37] out of me
[51:42] I said well that's silly
[51:44] now you're the one that's silly
[51:47] because of your thinking
[51:50] but then when you get exposed you get
[51:52] all upset remember the other day what I
[51:54] was saying
[51:55] if you got that true Holy Ghost Inside
[51:57] of there
[51:58] you ain't going to argue with what I'm
[52:00] saying if it's truth
[52:02] but there's going to be this body in
[52:04] this Spirit part of us
[52:07] is going to reveal
[52:10] until that inside man says shut up he's
[52:13] right
[52:14] it can't be no other way
[52:18] see then things starts lining up all
[52:20] right
[52:21] because your souls were made up before
[52:23] the foundation of the world when God
[52:26] created man in his own image
[52:31] Spirit of man
[52:34] not a man
[52:36] in his own image but man in his own
[52:39] image what a special man that he made to
[52:42] be what and he made them male and female
[52:45] before he ever had a man in the dust of
[52:49] the Earth
[52:52] so the soul of man was created before
[52:54] the world ever begun now
[52:57] um
[52:59] I don't know where to go into that this
[53:00] morning with it or later this evening
[53:02] but uh
[53:06] because I don't want to put out too much
[53:09] in their thinking you think I do but I
[53:12] try to
[53:13] that's why I tear up a lot of notes and
[53:15] a lot of paper it goes in the trash can
[53:17] and I redo and go again because I try to
[53:20] think like you think
[53:22] and I try to think on the basis of
[53:24] humanity of how that we think
[53:26] and I try to think about how that I can
[53:29] use that to contact the end part of the
[53:31] inward part of you instead of your body
[53:34] you know because that would would do
[53:37] but just think of just stay with me and
[53:40] think about it
[53:42] think about this man
[53:45] this made in Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[53:49] that he was made before the world
[53:53] now don't get all involved in
[53:57] predestinations and pre-existences and
[54:00] and things like that that's why I said I
[54:02] didn't know where to bring that in don't
[54:04] get all tied up in those things just
[54:07] stay with me of what I'm thinking about
[54:10] that this man would be a special
[54:12] creation
[54:15] and it wouldn't be a physical creation
[54:17] it would be a spiritual creation and it
[54:19] wouldn't be a creation
[54:22] as much as it would be that God is
[54:26] expanding himself
[54:30] God is
[54:32] constantly going out like Aaron was over
[54:35] there and there Wednesday night when you
[54:37] talk about Infinity if you cut it in
[54:39] half you still got Infinity
[54:41] okay
[54:43] and see the longer that God goes to me
[54:45] the more will be unfolding
[54:49] even when we get there
[54:51] it'll just be constant unfolding of the
[54:55] word of God
[54:57] and we won't have these carnal Minds to
[54:59] deal with all right
[55:02] but you see then this man that was
[55:05] created in Genesis 1
[55:08] he was put in the man of Genesis 2.
[55:11] correct
[55:13] all right
[55:15] and you know what
[55:18] is we'll get to it later the prophet
[55:20] said he was lonely
[55:22] and a reason or Lonesome if you you
[55:25] don't let don't run in lonely you won't
[55:27] find it
[55:28] run in launch some if you're going to
[55:30] study on your computer
[55:32] that he was lonesome
[55:35] you know why
[55:37] he had no help me
[55:40] physically Eve within him
[55:44] at that time
[55:48] but once he had already been placed over
[55:51] there into flesh
[55:54] Eve was still in theophany
[55:57] now you better start realizing this man
[56:00] that you're talking about in Genesis 1
[56:02] 26 and 27 is the theophany man
[56:06] now get away from all of that but
[56:08] brother Dale my theophany is up yonder I
[56:12] hear it calling me
[56:14] but Rhino said on who this melted dick
[56:17] when you got born again you heard from
[56:18] it well did you hear from it up there
[56:26] remember there's no two eternities
[56:31] so when it says we have one in Heavens
[56:34] eternal
[56:37] support safe
[56:42] you see it's demanding that we try to
[56:45] use these Cranium caps that we call a
[56:49] brain because that's the one I got to
[56:51] talk to
[56:53] but I'm trying to speak to the one
[56:54] that's inside of you
[56:57] I'm trying to talk about salvation and
[57:00] what's doing and we don't believe in
[57:02] pre-existence of Souls
[57:07] that's a Mormon Doctrine but I do
[57:10] believe in pre-existence of God
[57:16] right I do believe in pre-existence of
[57:19] him and his being don't you
[57:23] so whatever he would be
[57:29] is pre-existence
[57:33] and brother random will state what you
[57:36] always was eternal
[57:39] now we know for certain this not the
[57:42] body
[57:45] we know for a certainty it's not the
[57:47] spirit
[57:48] so then he's got to be speaking of the
[57:51] inward part of us called the soul
[57:54] all right
[57:57] but just remember also on who is this
[57:59] male chastity that you bypassed your
[58:01] theophany
[58:05] we'll get to that we're going along
[58:08] but I want you to think with me
[58:12] how real is your god
[58:17] and then how real are you
[58:25] do we even consider how real we are
[58:31] do you realize that brother Branham said
[58:33] that if it wasn't for the bar that God
[58:36] was holding that
[58:38] you would create a world and go live on
[58:40] it
[58:41] paraphrasing it it's close
[58:47] you know that he said if you take it
[58:48] whether Aaron talking about Wednesday
[58:49] night the word of God upon your lips and
[58:52] speak is deity speaking you realize
[58:55] those quotes
[58:59] well
[59:01] is that just a thought coming from up
[59:04] yonder somewhere
[59:08] or is it coming from within
[59:13] which one is it
[59:16] when brother Brandon would say thus
[59:18] saith the Lord
[59:19] or even I say you know to you
[59:24] was that
[59:26] way up yonder
[59:30] I remind you that he said brother said
[59:33] Moses got the thought
[59:36] he said first it was a thought he said
[59:39] then Moses got to thought he said it's
[59:41] not word yet
[59:43] he said because Moses has got to speak
[59:45] it
[59:47] all right we're going to have to speak a
[59:49] lot of things in in our lives whether
[59:51] you believe it or not or believe you can
[59:53] do it
[59:55] you know
[59:57] I don't understand though how come we
[59:59] don't trying to illustrate a little bit
[1:00:01] last night
[1:00:03] the brother was telling that that he
[1:00:06] loved music in his early life you know
[1:00:10] and that those things bother
[1:00:13] you know
[1:00:15] but you know what I thought about and I
[1:00:17] told him
[1:00:18] I said you used to you didn't have
[1:00:20] anything inside of you fighting about
[1:00:22] that you just all music
[1:00:24] you know you just all the world
[1:00:27] but I said ain't it a wonderful or
[1:00:29] opponent of trying to bring into
[1:00:30] wonderful thing that you could finally
[1:00:33] realize that there's something inside of
[1:00:34] you don't want to do that
[1:00:39] let's say something inside of you
[1:00:41] that don't want to follow that music
[1:00:45] and that inside of us that don't want to
[1:00:48] follow that music may take a whole lot
[1:00:51] of these virtues to be able to get us to
[1:00:53] the place that we don't jump around and
[1:00:55] move a little bit when the music comes
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:02] so we're just talking about salvation
[1:01:05] well do you see what the prophet is
[1:01:07] saying
[1:01:08] not the physical man wasn't created
[1:01:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:13] but this soul that he's speaking of here
[1:01:17] and that my watch because I've got it in
[1:01:20] my notes for later
[1:01:22] you say well
[1:01:24] with all mankind created before the
[1:01:26] world in the mind of God
[1:01:31] there's the defining of the difference
[1:01:32] in a point
[1:01:35] all man before the world God in his mind
[1:01:38] knew every person that would ever be
[1:01:40] born is that true
[1:01:42] and he could write their names in the
[1:01:44] lounge book or leave them out on the
[1:01:46] last book right
[1:01:48] because that was in his mind but that
[1:01:51] was in his mind of what would happen
[1:01:53] when mankind got here
[1:01:57] right
[1:02:01] right but what about the group of people
[1:02:05] that job was asked a question where Were
[1:02:07] You When The Morning Star signed
[1:02:08] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:02:10] joy
[1:02:12] brother Brown said that's for the
[1:02:13] foundation of the world when they saw
[1:02:15] the Plan of Salvation
[1:02:20] now you're getting
[1:02:23] the only one I got in pre-existence
[1:02:29] this man of 126 and 27 is a special man
[1:02:35] if you want no problems to cover it
[1:02:38] that's the Christ
[1:02:42] that's the logos
[1:02:44] that's the great words we use theophanes
[1:02:46] and all of the things that we try to
[1:02:48] follow you know
[1:02:53] this man here was created before the
[1:02:55] world
[1:03:01] but remember when he would say you
[1:03:02] always was eternal he said if you have
[1:03:07] eternal life
[1:03:10] you always was eternal
[1:03:15] and over in the Little John's it says
[1:03:18] that this person cannot sin because the
[1:03:22] seed remaineth in him
[1:03:24] and he cannot sin
[1:03:26] but then he turns around and says we sin
[1:03:28] every day
[1:03:30] now you got Mass confusion
[1:03:35] no you don't if you got it right
[1:03:39] that seed cannot sin he talking about me
[1:03:41] and you
[1:03:43] talking about that seed ain't no way
[1:03:45] that seed can sin because that seed is
[1:03:47] Christ
[1:03:50] you didn't come into the world with
[1:03:52] eternal life
[1:03:54] that's what we'll get to later Adam was
[1:03:57] the first one and he come into the world
[1:04:00] standing there and he breathed into his
[1:04:03] nostrils
[1:04:05] and he became a living soul
[1:04:09] what was he before he breathed into his
[1:04:11] nostrils
[1:04:19] you see we we try to
[1:04:22] take a lot of things but we need a lot
[1:04:24] of understanding don't we
[1:04:26] but if I can confuse you enough to get
[1:04:29] you to study then I've done my job just
[1:04:31] as well as it is if I've tried my best
[1:04:33] because that's that's the way I'm doing
[1:04:35] the happy
[1:04:39] brother brother there you're trying to
[1:04:40] confuse us no
[1:04:42] listening I said if I can do that
[1:04:45] if I can confuse you then there's one
[1:04:49] thing about it you don't know what the
[1:04:50] truth is
[1:04:52] right
[1:04:59] if I can take away his brother Al said
[1:05:01] why don't you go direct brother down get
[1:05:03] him let him talk you out of what you
[1:05:04] believe
[1:05:05] if I can talk you out of what you
[1:05:07] believe
[1:05:09] then you got a very flimsy belief
[1:05:16] but think about it
[1:05:19] this man of 126 and 27 is not a physical
[1:05:23] man
[1:05:25] we know that because he put into the two
[1:05:28] seven which is a physical man right
[1:05:31] right and while he's in this
[1:05:34] spiritual creation
[1:05:37] he's both male and female
[1:05:45] right
[1:05:48] now we want to put it over in flesh as
[1:05:50] male and female now
[1:05:56] according to the Bible and according to
[1:05:58] the prophet according to what I just
[1:06:00] read here about what he says is your
[1:06:03] souls were made up before the foundation
[1:06:05] of world when God created man in his own
[1:06:07] image Spirit of man not a man in his own
[1:06:09] image but man in his own image and then
[1:06:12] he made them male and female before he
[1:06:16] ever had a man in the dust of the Earth
[1:06:19] so this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27
[1:06:24] is both male and female
[1:06:30] right now if that wasn't true folks
[1:06:34] remember I don't throw off on the
[1:06:36] sisters but I do try to preach the truth
[1:06:39] remember sisters you have no hope
[1:06:41] whatsoever except
[1:06:44] for the man that you're under
[1:06:52] so you better have a head somewhere
[1:06:57] and that's what we're talking about
[1:07:00] because well I've never been married or
[1:07:01] anything within your father's your head
[1:07:03] until you get married and then your
[1:07:04] husband's your head then something goes
[1:07:06] wrong to argue that's going to turn to
[1:07:07] God to be your head
[1:07:09] no I'd turn to start with no he can't
[1:07:11] turn to start with because he's put all
[1:07:12] them other things in the coin
[1:07:14] I didn't do that he did
[1:07:17] he put that you're under your father
[1:07:21] that's the Bible he puts her under your
[1:07:23] husband that's Bible
[1:07:27] but then when you come to the point that
[1:07:29] you don't have one
[1:07:31] see then you can go to God right but you
[1:07:34] won't throw off on the others because
[1:07:36] you'll realize it's true
[1:07:38] all right
[1:07:40] now listen
[1:07:43] according to Ezekiel 18 4 the Bible says
[1:07:47] behold All Souls are mine
[1:07:53] as the soul of the father so also the
[1:07:56] soul of the son is mine the soul
[1:07:59] incentive shall die
[1:08:02] Peter of souls you know the two Soul
[1:08:04] Doctrine Satan give you a soul and this
[1:08:07] that and what Satan can't give you a
[1:08:10] soul
[1:08:11] he can't create
[1:08:15] he can pervert
[1:08:18] but he can't create
[1:08:21] I mean
[1:08:24] only God can create
[1:08:27] because All Souls no matter whether it's
[1:08:29] Christians or or lost All Souls belong
[1:08:33] to God
[1:08:36] now he didn't give them to you wrong
[1:08:43] he gives every baby
[1:08:46] a choice of free moral agency
[1:08:49] but I told you about my brother he said
[1:08:51] God can't blame me for being wrong he
[1:08:53] made me wrong I said no he didn't make
[1:08:54] you wrong you got 12 years College which
[1:08:57] you can't got common sense
[1:08:59] she didn't make you wrong
[1:09:02] he made you perfect
[1:09:05] you went wrong
[1:09:07] because of the condition and the life
[1:09:09] you lived
[1:09:11] so you can't blame God for saying we're
[1:09:13] blame Mom and Daddy well okay if you
[1:09:16] don't got a drink because my Mom and
[1:09:18] Daddy drank that's a flimsy excuse
[1:09:23] but it made and made it it made a a a a
[1:09:27] a gene in me
[1:09:30] I'd done been through all of that
[1:09:34] they try to prove this that and the
[1:09:36] other I done told you where I stand
[1:09:39] you say well homosexuality is a gene as
[1:09:42] well no it's a hereditary trait of where
[1:09:44] you live and what's going on
[1:09:47] it's a simple fact of you close your
[1:09:49] eyes and don't use them after a while
[1:09:51] they'll go away
[1:09:53] is that right
[1:09:56] they found animals out in in the dark
[1:09:59] parts of the ocean and has no eyeballs
[1:10:00] why because they don't need them
[1:10:05] I can't help but being an alcoholic my
[1:10:08] daddy was an alcoholic
[1:10:10] and I know now you get into drugs you
[1:10:12] got a lot more to deal with but that
[1:10:14] still is not the answer you can't lay
[1:10:16] back on that my daddy would I come in
[1:10:19] the world of drug you
[1:10:21] know
[1:10:25] if you get born again he'll take care of
[1:10:27] the druggie
[1:10:29] now as a human being that may be true
[1:10:32] that you'll follow that
[1:10:34] but if you're born again it'll take care
[1:10:36] of those times
[1:10:37] remember
[1:10:39] no longer can it be said that the
[1:10:42] fathers are ate grapes in the children's
[1:10:44] teeth were on edge
[1:10:47] that is in the Bible you know
[1:10:49] all right
[1:10:51] but listen
[1:10:53] this man that was created there
[1:10:56] was not the physical man
[1:11:01] it was the man in the image of God
[1:11:06] all right what is God
[1:11:11] then this would be the son of God
[1:11:15] right right
[1:11:18] and that's why in the only one in the
[1:11:21] Old Testament that had eternal life was
[1:11:23] Adam
[1:11:25] and Eve
[1:11:27] we don't want to put that in there
[1:11:32] because we still want her to be a dog
[1:11:34] meat
[1:11:39] see then Jesus Christ when he came he
[1:11:41] didn't just have eternal life it wasn't
[1:11:43] imparted to him he was eternal life
[1:11:47] it was imparted to Adam to have what he
[1:11:49] had
[1:11:53] so this man that we're talking about
[1:11:55] this Genesis 1 26 27 but was created
[1:11:58] before the world not just in the mind of
[1:12:01] God
[1:12:06] wait a minute you're getting too close
[1:12:07] well I like to ride the edge
[1:12:14] this man was
[1:12:19] brother Branham says it now we'll get to
[1:12:21] it it's on Blasphemous names he said
[1:12:24] especially into Adam he breathed the
[1:12:26] breath of eternal life
[1:12:29] what did he do with Adam he put Genesis
[1:12:31] 1 into Genesis 2. is that sensible
[1:12:38] and he said especially into Adam
[1:12:41] eternal life he says
[1:12:45] but I didn't I didn't think nobody could
[1:12:46] be Eternal until Christ came remember
[1:12:48] this is the creation
[1:12:51] and the creation always Begins full
[1:12:54] grown
[1:12:55] except the Lord Jesus which had to be to
[1:12:57] all man all things and then he would
[1:12:59] have to be a baby and come forth to be
[1:13:01] that but remember still he was the
[1:13:04] beginning of the creation of God
[1:13:06] remember he didn't become Eternal on the
[1:13:09] River Jordan
[1:13:11] that's what they're saying he was just a
[1:13:14] man till then and then he become Eternal
[1:13:15] and then Eternal left him and then he
[1:13:17] died of man well if he did you know how
[1:13:19] no savior
[1:13:21] that's plain sins
[1:13:24] but are you listening
[1:13:26] what was made what was back there before
[1:13:28] the world
[1:13:31] go ahead with number nine we bypassed a
[1:13:33] few quotes we can get back to them when
[1:13:36] we need them
[1:13:37] but look what your Prophet has to say on
[1:13:39] the modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:13:42] increases 65.
[1:13:47] but the real ordained of God
[1:13:50] that real Gene
[1:13:52] that real germ I wish you would one day
[1:13:55] take a dictionary and look up Gene and
[1:13:59] look up germ
[1:14:07] I may be wrong in it but I think it's
[1:14:09] right it's the gene first where's the
[1:14:11] nurse is at around here somewhere got a
[1:14:13] couple of them
[1:14:14] it's Gene first I think right because
[1:14:16] that's due and then it turns into a germ
[1:14:18] because that's later on
[1:14:20] it has to developed to be a germ
[1:14:24] and if you study the prophet's message
[1:14:26] from Gene and germ form you might learn
[1:14:29] a lot
[1:14:31] all right
[1:14:32] because it means stages of development
[1:14:35] see it's Gene germ seed
[1:14:40] right all right
[1:14:43] but the real ordained of God that real
[1:14:45] Gene that real germ a soul of God that
[1:14:48] was in God before the foundation of the
[1:14:52] world
[1:14:57] oh you believe in pre-existence I
[1:15:00] believe in pre-existence of that soul
[1:15:06] which is the soul of God
[1:15:08] I do that
[1:15:11] I always believe that
[1:15:13] God's eternal
[1:15:15] a soul of God that was in God before the
[1:15:17] foundation World remember you that's
[1:15:19] really got the spirit of God in you
[1:15:20] tonight remember you that's really got
[1:15:23] the spirit of God in you tonight
[1:15:27] you were here in Christ
[1:15:29] because he was the fullness of the word
[1:15:32] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:15:34] bodily God was in Christ reconcile the
[1:15:37] world to himself do you believe that
[1:15:38] look he was in Christ then if you were
[1:15:42] in God a gene a word a attribute from
[1:15:47] the beginning then you walk with him
[1:15:50] here on Earth
[1:15:52] you talk with him on Earth you suffered
[1:15:55] with him on Earth
[1:15:57] you died with him at Calvary and you
[1:16:01] Rose with him again
[1:16:03] and now you're sitting in Heavenly
[1:16:05] places in Christ Jesus communing with
[1:16:07] him the word
[1:16:09] as it feeds upon feeds into your soul
[1:16:14] that man shall live by every word that
[1:16:17] proceedeth
[1:16:18] okay we want to go with this don't we
[1:16:22] just leave it right there
[1:16:24] we want to go with this
[1:16:26] we want to believe we was in Christ and
[1:16:29] we walk
[1:16:30] and we've done all these things but we
[1:16:33] don't want to believe we was up here in
[1:16:34] him
[1:16:36] now that's who I'm talking about I ain't
[1:16:38] talking about a bunch of little Souls
[1:16:40] running around up in heaven
[1:16:46] I don't believe that that's Mormon
[1:16:49] Doctrine to pre-existence
[1:16:55] if we were a part of God before the
[1:16:57] foundation of the world
[1:17:02] then we're part of God now
[1:17:05] we just remember now we've got to cover
[1:17:07] it
[1:17:08] that you bypassed what you should have
[1:17:11] been
[1:17:14] and come into World lost
[1:17:18] and we receive eternal life here
[1:17:22] no I always always Eternal well why is
[1:17:24] your face red
[1:17:26] you know why is that Spirit getting all
[1:17:29] upset in you
[1:17:34] yeah but I got where the Prophet said it
[1:17:36] he said we always was eternal yeah read
[1:17:39] before and after
[1:17:42] if you have eternal life
[1:17:46] you always was eternal what the life
[1:17:50] eternal life
[1:17:52] but there was a time we didn't have it
[1:17:57] you know that right around him said on
[1:17:59] birth pain he said it was so hard to get
[1:18:02] those religious Pharisees to realize
[1:18:05] they were Sinners or lost
[1:18:08] now this is his words
[1:18:10] that he could die for him
[1:18:14] you know the hardest thing that I've had
[1:18:16] in my life as to try to minister to
[1:18:18] people
[1:18:19] is to try to get people to realize
[1:18:21] they're lost
[1:18:34] little you know you're saved
[1:18:37] because I've got another statement to
[1:18:40] make behind that one okay
[1:18:42] because if you're saved you cannot deny
[1:18:49] the word
[1:18:52] right
[1:18:56] you see why Reed did
[1:18:59] that's not me saying it
[1:19:01] you got to admit that I do tell you
[1:19:04] where the Prophet said this and I invite
[1:19:07] you to go find things different
[1:19:10] and coming let's talk about it from the
[1:19:12] shine prophet's message
[1:19:15] and let's talk about it but let's don't
[1:19:17] get in our own philosophies
[1:19:20] you know
[1:19:22] let's get in the Bible in the prophet's
[1:19:24] message and just see what it says
[1:19:29] random one time he said what he said you
[1:19:31] start your eternal life right here at
[1:19:33] the altar
[1:19:34] well that was back in 59 before he he
[1:19:38] really seen what it should have been in
[1:19:40] 63 and oh you're beautiful
[1:19:46] that's that mind that man that's created
[1:19:50] that has the ability to think to reason
[1:19:53] to do
[1:19:58] and I realized talking to you that's why
[1:20:01] it's hard sometimes to put up quotes
[1:20:03] I've thought about putting it up one
[1:20:04] line at the time because see a lot of
[1:20:06] you are reading down here and I'm up
[1:20:08] here
[1:20:10] or a lot of you I'm down here and you're
[1:20:11] still up here
[1:20:16] am I right
[1:20:18] okay I got a couple of rides
[1:20:22] let me get one more quote and we'll quit
[1:20:26] all right go ahead with number nine
[1:20:27] there wait a minute let's see we got 10.
[1:20:31] where he walked with him and talked with
[1:20:33] him
[1:20:34] let's get one more which is 1960 the
[1:20:36] queen be number 11 brush
[1:20:40] and look what your Prophet had to say
[1:20:42] about the Queen of Sheba 1960.
[1:20:45] e75 wrote it on up to the other you read
[1:20:48] in between there see for what I'm doing
[1:20:49] dry
[1:20:51] and when the the life that was in the
[1:20:54] animal that died
[1:20:56] the animal could not come back and be a
[1:20:59] spirit with the human being
[1:21:01] because it was animal life without a
[1:21:04] soul
[1:21:05] but when Jesus died
[1:21:08] it was a soul of God
[1:21:12] now you tell me your God didn't die
[1:21:16] go ahead argue all you want to do
[1:21:18] and when the cell that was broke it
[1:21:21] Sanctified a church that the Holy Ghost
[1:21:22] would come and live in it then it's God
[1:21:25] above us God With Us
[1:21:27] is God in us
[1:21:28] who was Jesus
[1:21:30] God almighty
[1:21:34] right
[1:21:36] did he have a soul there's a couple of
[1:21:38] quotes beyond our the Bible speaks of
[1:21:40] the Soul
[1:21:41] the Bible speaks and said in my soul is
[1:21:44] troubled the the the Redemption we
[1:21:48] talked about last week the things that
[1:21:50] are and then when you come on down we
[1:21:52] brought it to the prophet where he was
[1:21:54] saying what
[1:21:55] that he said in body he was
[1:21:58] you know I'll get these in repeating the
[1:22:00] seed and said in body he was a man was
[1:22:02] sitting Soul he and
[1:22:04] he was God he said in body he was a man
[1:22:07] he said in spirit he was God
[1:22:11] all right
[1:22:13] so when that baby was born
[1:22:16] there was the body the spirit the soul
[1:22:21] the body of creation
[1:22:23] not by mankind
[1:22:25] with the soul wouldn't of creation
[1:22:28] and neither was it an impartation as
[1:22:31] Adam had to be
[1:22:35] he was God
[1:22:40] see you don't think about him being Body
[1:22:42] Spirit and soul do you
[1:22:45] you don't think about Jesus as being
[1:22:47] Body Spirit and soul
[1:22:52] remember that's what he was
[1:22:56] and that's what you are
[1:23:00] his soul went to hell right
[1:23:04] he sold his theophany his person of his
[1:23:08] being
[1:23:10] you remember that quote
[1:23:12] went to hell
[1:23:14] the spirit went back to God who gave it
[1:23:16] the body went in the grave
[1:23:18] and his soul went to hell
[1:23:21] was it a spirit floating around and
[1:23:23] going down into hell where those people
[1:23:25] were there in there
[1:23:27] so
[1:23:30] that's why brother Branham will use Soul
[1:23:32] as theophany for the sinner
[1:23:36] because it's simply the word theophany
[1:23:39] means a body of deity or whatever your
[1:23:41] deity is whatever your leading is
[1:23:49] this man of Genesis 1 26 and 27 was a
[1:23:51] very special creation because it was
[1:23:54] really an impartation on God
[1:24:00] it was God not just being over there and
[1:24:04] you know he that part that went out is
[1:24:07] that man that was standing there
[1:24:10] we went through those over and over and
[1:24:11] over a part of God I I don't see how you
[1:24:14] talk about a part of God
[1:24:19] just remembered my statements is any
[1:24:21] part of God
[1:24:24] is God
[1:24:28] any water out of the ocean is the same
[1:24:30] chemical of the ocean
[1:24:35] is counted on volume
[1:24:38] and just remember we the prophets that
[1:24:41] are part of God
[1:24:47] see months and months and months and
[1:24:49] I've been driving all these things
[1:24:51] hoping that you'd listen
[1:24:54] and I'm not going to ask you to raise
[1:24:55] your hand but how many of you went back
[1:24:56] and listened to some of these tapes
[1:24:58] how many has even heard what you missed
[1:25:03] I go back and listen to my own messages
[1:25:06] when I get a chance I do
[1:25:09] I love to do it I sit there and cry
[1:25:14] know how great I am
[1:25:16] but how great God he is
[1:25:19] that can reveal himself
[1:25:21] to mankind
[1:25:23] through a prophet
[1:25:26] to bring us a message
[1:25:30] for us to see God
[1:25:33] I thought that was what our whole thing
[1:25:35] was to be in here come on musician I
[1:25:37] thought that was what we wish to be here
[1:25:40] you know I I thought we was to be here
[1:25:43] to learn of God
[1:25:45] yeah but you just confused I didn't
[1:25:47] confuse you honey you was confused
[1:25:50] already
[1:25:52] I just exposed your confusion
[1:25:57] put it out in the open to let you see
[1:25:59] that you're confused
[1:26:01] I didn't make you that
[1:26:05] but just remember one thing your body
[1:26:07] and your spirit May argue with me about
[1:26:09] a lot of things
[1:26:10] but if you're born again that inside man
[1:26:13] ain't going to argue about the word
[1:26:19] it's going to stay with the word here
[1:26:20] regardless let's stand
[1:26:22] what do we got brother 333 just a minute
[1:26:25] and then we'll go
[1:26:28] 3 333 333
[1:26:31] anybody have a need the altar's open
[1:26:34] all right
[1:26:37] Jesus
[1:26:40] silver and gold
[1:26:48] think about it
[1:26:58] I'd rather have Jesus than anything
[1:27:13] away
[1:27:25] oh I'd Rather Have Jesus
[1:27:37] Lord Jesus
[1:27:39] our brothers got an opportunity to talk
[1:27:41] about a job we know he needs one but we
[1:27:45] just asking now to go make it manifest
[1:27:47] let him see whether it's you or not
[1:27:51] let him understand
[1:27:53] and be guided by your love in Jesus name
[1:28:06] you know that reminds me of something
[1:28:09] happened in my life
[1:28:13] a lot of you know about it I was offered
[1:28:15] a job one time of being an insurance
[1:28:17] salesman we owned back
[1:28:21] at that time I wasn't making very much
[1:28:23] money it was very
[1:28:25] you know
[1:28:28] they offered me everything in the world
[1:28:31] to try to make it right or that I could
[1:28:33] be an insurance salesman
[1:28:37] and you know I wasn't even uh born-again
[1:28:40] believer
[1:28:44] but I asked God I said let this thing be
[1:28:46] one way or the other
[1:28:49] and you showed me in this where you want
[1:28:51] me to do
[1:28:53] the man sat down and he said what you
[1:28:56] gonna do Sam I said I'll move down
[1:28:59] because I would get a whole County
[1:29:01] come on
[1:29:03] so I'd move down there and the first
[1:29:05] thing I do I'd find me a good church to
[1:29:07] join because back then I was a good
[1:29:09] Baptist
[1:29:11] and I saw find me a good church is on he
[1:29:14] said Sam said join the First Baptist
[1:29:18] well see he was right mentally speaking
[1:29:21] he said calls in the First Baptist is
[1:29:22] where all the people is at with the
[1:29:24] money
[1:29:26] go to that First Baptist well that was
[1:29:29] right that was exactly right I walked
[1:29:32] out of there and I said Lord I will not
[1:29:33] take that job
[1:29:38] because I'd ask him to tell me
[1:29:41] and I saw what it meant
[1:29:45] it didn't mean for me to stay the same
[1:29:47] as I was
[1:29:48] and just move on
[1:29:50] it meant to move into some kind of
[1:29:52] worldly event for her you know
[1:29:55] and I knew I wasn't going to do that
[1:30:00] trust him
[1:30:20] I'd rather relaxed
[1:30:55] you heard our brother he had physical
[1:30:58] needs you touch him
[1:31:00] but he has a spiritual need here Lord
