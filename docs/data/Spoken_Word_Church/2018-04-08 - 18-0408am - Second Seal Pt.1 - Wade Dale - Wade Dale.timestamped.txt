[8:16] couple of weeks so good to have them all
[8:18] back couldn't have them all arrested I
[8:23] guess that wasn't much of a name man but
[8:27] I guess they probably need another week
[8:30] off to rest for the week they took off
[8:31] right they never wear that happens on a
[8:34] vacation you take a vacation need take a
[8:35] few days off after the vacation or you

[8:41] Bibles let's turn now to the Book of
[8:43] Revelations what we're going to do today
[8:46] is we got to services so we don't take
[8:49] our time hey man that all right and we
[8:55] will enter into the second seal today
[8:59] we're going to review a little bit with
[9:00] the first and then we'll enter back into
[9:01] the go into the second seal but go back
[9:03] into the first just for a few minutes
[9:05] polish up some things that we that we
[9:08] saw again last night while we were
[9:10] yesterday while we're students so don't
[9:13] you pray for me the devil trying to give
[9:14] me the cred so I'm boot him enough so
[9:18] y'all believe blew them too so but I may
[9:20] have to do the estimate do that but
[9:23] that's okay we're still in these human
[9:24] bodies but that's alright we're going to
[9:25] persevere good to have that group last
[9:28] night the Bible study man that was
[9:30] probably half the church they're almost
[9:32] of a failed to build the building up so
[9:34] those you that missed it well you missed
[9:37] it it's your fault what did you do what
[9:44] did you do oh we sat and watched service
[9:45] we watched online no well forget it
[9:47] whatever Bible study we had a good time
[9:50] though we had a real good time Bible
[9:51] study brother Louisa's message Wednesday
[9:54] night if y'all didn't hear it you need
[9:56] to hear it and you know what that calls
[9:58] to Louie's Thursday morning there was a
[10:01] 5.3 earthquake call for the coast of
[10:04] California
[10:05] one strongest one that had in that a
[10:07] long time and it was off the coast right
[10:09] at Los Angeles getting close people we
[10:15] can we can we can make excuses if we
[10:18] want to but there's only one shelter
[10:20] that's in the Word of God we can take
[10:22] everything else we want to take and go
[10:24] wherever we want to go but the Word of
[10:25] God is what's going to keep us that's
[10:27] thinking yesterday you know they if you
[10:29] got a cell phone in your pocket they can
[10:32] find you so that's the GPS so and you
[10:35] got one in your car now everybody this
[10:37] kind of new cars go to GPS well guess
[10:38] what the government can listen in the
[10:41] government or whoever it is we take the
[10:42] government but whoever it is can listen
[10:45] in so it's only good it's only going to
[10:47] be God when that third pull is going
[10:51] that will be just for a group of people
[10:53] that trust in God and no one else
[10:55] amen and if you'll catch it like brother
[10:58] Brown said if you'll catch it we are
[11:00] speaking on the third pole because like
[11:04] I was talking about the clock last night
[11:06] and about his wife but we were talking
[11:08] about the the message and he said his
[11:11] church he just got so cold and I said
[11:13] well most of ours is too just cold cold
[11:15] too formal
[11:16] we we call it a church that's what they
[11:19] called it in Rome a church I thought it
[11:22] wasn't a church I thought was people
[11:24] amen are you people growing not my
[11:26] church is growing by numbers well what
[11:28] does that matter
[11:28] but as your people growing and your
[11:31] people growing your people is what it is
[11:33] will the third pole who is it - to the
[11:35] bride to the church and to the totally
[11:40] lost who will never know what's going on
[11:43] and they're sitting right around it hey
[11:45] man so just when you give you that
[11:48] little tidbit of information there
[11:50] because we from that message Wednesday
[11:52] night we need to wake up we we are
[11:56] complacent and all of us are and we do
[12:00] things that we shouldn't do and and
[12:02] that's why we're going through these
[12:03] seals it talks about a nick word in it
[12:05] talks about sin and transgression and
[12:07] all these things where we're trying to
[12:09] sharpen it out but brother Clark now
[12:11] we're talking you know we we are the
[12:13] cleanest people on the face of the earth
[12:14] now we are the cleanest living people on
[12:18] the face of the earth
[12:19] be denominations don't care about
[12:21] marriage and divorce they married
[12:23] divorce ten times 20 times they don't
[12:25] matter you know they have they have many
[12:28] meetings for divorced couples well that
[12:30] don't fly on the message folks we we
[12:33] don't have he had he had somebody call
[12:35] him and said should I divorce my wife
[12:37] brother closet unless she's committing
[12:40] fornication UK divorce her period what
[12:43] do you want to discuss this about
[12:44] there's no divorce in this message
[12:48] we don't have counsel for divorce in the
[12:52] met why because we're supposed to be set
[12:54] aside and kept clean because we had a
[12:55] prophet come told us the truth whether
[12:59] you believe it or not he told us the
[13:00] truth and the truth what's gonna set you
[13:03] free not some man's idea it's not some
[13:05] discussion that we have but that's what
[13:07] we're when brother Brown got on these
[13:09] seals he said you said you people
[13:11] realize this is that third pull in other
[13:13] words it cannot be imitated so we know
[13:17] one thing for sure the denominations
[13:18] can't imitate us they're so far away we
[13:23] will read it now where we've come up now
[13:26] to the fourth age and he said y'all have
[13:29] suffered that woman Jezebel nobody let
[13:32] me tell you something Jezebel's come
[13:34] back in the church Jezebel has come back
[13:37] in the church you said no she's in that
[13:39] church well no she's in this church
[13:41] because it's the devil that ain't
[13:43] Jezebel it's the devil that's trying to
[13:46] what divide and conquer that's why you
[13:48] see the Pope divide and conquer
[13:50] that's not victory that's divide and
[13:52] conquer he wants to divide and conquer
[13:55] this place so to go to Revelation six
[13:58] we're gonna read 1 through 4 and just
[14:03] take her time today if that's all right

[14:32] give her ever
[14:33] landlords will drop down that 12 inches
[14:36] from the brain to the heart not the
[14:40] thumping part of man but the very heart
[14:42] the very soul of the individual today
[14:45] and shake us Lord stir us that we watch
[14:48] and wait and see that your coming is
[14:51] drawing nigh and that you will come and
[14:54] get a group of people there nothing

[14:58] because we say we're bright you're gonna
[15:00] come and get us because we are bright
[15:02] and we act like bright and we do the
[15:05] things that the bride does we think the
[15:07] things that the bride things father we
[15:09] thank you for these things Lord that
[15:10] you've brought to us in this endtime no
[15:14] one else since the dawn of time has been
[15:15] able to open this book and be able to
[15:18] see the things that we see and we should
[15:20] be happy for that Lord thank you for
[15:23] this day forgive us of our sins and our
[15:24] many mistakes that we make Lord bless
[15:27] the missionaries on the foreign fields
[15:28] give them fruit for their labor bless
[15:31] the ones that are not here that are sick
[15:32] the ones that are not with us Lord today
[15:34] we pray that you would just go to them
[15:37] and strengthen their body Lord save the
[15:39] Lost
[15:39] heal the sick father in the name of
[15:41] Jesus Christ amen
[15:43] he's still a sin killing God and man and
[15:47] I saw when the lamb opened one of the
[15:48] seals and I heard it was the noise of
[15:50] thunder one of the four beasts saying
[15:51] come and see and I saw him behold a
[15:53] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[15:55] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[15:57] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[15:59] now that's what we've been on now we're
[16:00] gonna get ready to enter into the second
[16:03] seal after we do just a little bit of
[16:04] background and when he had opened the
[16:06] second seal I heard the second beast say
[16:09] come and see no thunder go straight into
[16:11] there straight into the scene like we
[16:14] were talking about last night John wrote
[16:15] a scene he wrote what he saw no
[16:18] interpretation he wrote what he saw and
[16:20] there went out another horse and that
[16:22] was another horse but the same rider and
[16:25] then another horse or another power but
[16:28] the same rider and power was given to
[16:31] him that sat thereon that said on the
[16:33] horse to take peace from the earth and
[16:36] that they should kill one another and
[16:37] there was given unto him a great sword
[16:40] and we know what a sword is it's a word
[16:42] the man you may be seated in the Lord at
[16:44] his blessing for the reading of the word
[16:48] now before we get into the second seal I
[16:51] was reminded to go back and review just
[16:55] a few minutes and I believe we will
[16:56] since we have a little time and review
[17:00] and read some of the things I forgot my
[17:03] chart I'd be right back love the Lord
[17:18] he's good to uh Sidney st. and trying to
[17:25] keep try to hinder us and kill us
[17:27] everywhere you can right a man does
[17:32] pretty good job sometimes but you know
[17:34] what the Bible says like we come back he
[17:36] that overcometh it's not he that codes
[17:38] of the Hinton's not to he that he that
[17:42] goes to the cushy birthday party no is
[17:46] he that has been through a battle
[17:47] they'll be battle-scarred veterans
[17:50] they're not people that didn't have to
[17:53] do anything
[17:54] amen I believe that I believe it'll be I
[17:57] believe it'll be battle-scarred veterans
[18:00] it'll be people this went through a
[18:01] battle and you'll know it too
[18:02] hey man don't you go through a battle
[18:06] already maybe we go through a battle
[18:10] already so all right we're gonna cover
[18:13] now the first two ages
[18:14] I mean first two seals and we know that
[18:17] all this other happens okay but we'll
[18:19] get to that in a minute all right if I
[18:22] witness a man all right
[18:24] first seal covers what the first three
[18:27] ages and we've got this as a lap over
[18:29] because we're going to look today that
[18:33] this church age this church age here
[18:37] ended in like 606 which is kind of weird
[18:41] that was a nice scene council all right
[18:43] but what happened was Constantine was
[18:45] back during that time too so what
[18:47] happened with Constantine he's bringing
[18:49] what church and state together so but
[18:52] we'll get into that in just a second
[18:53] let's pull up the first we want to see
[18:56] this
[18:57] as we've always looked Redemption
[19:01] Redemption we got to see the word
[19:03] Redemption don't forget that word we've
[19:05] we have been we have been lost and we
[19:09] are now able to be redeemable because of
[19:13] the new birth in our soul we come to a
[19:16] place where we can be we're already
[19:18] redeemed in the soul but we can take
[19:20] this body own to redemption amen those
[19:23] who he's justified he's already
[19:25] glorified all right so we'll that'll
[19:28] strike you one of these days the
[19:29] breaking of the seals is not necessarily
[19:31] for the soul I keep saying that because
[19:33] the blood of Jesus Christ
[19:35] it's what saves your soul that's what
[19:38] cleans your soul out hey man you go
[19:41] through justification which got chopped
[19:43] off your past sins he won't dwell with
[19:45] an unclean vessel sanctification unclean
[19:48] spirit goes out but we'll read it again
[19:50] a minute but unclean spirit goes out and
[19:51] sanctification amen so there must have
[19:54] been something unclean in you to start
[19:56] with we weren't so holy in past
[20:00] Paul had something unclean in him that's
[20:03] why I God had to knock him down get his
[20:05] attention but Paul had to go see
[20:07] somebody that was already in the body
[20:10] hey man
[20:12] because the seed comes to the body the
[20:15] what the word Ananias was in the word
[20:17] Paul thought he was in the word he was
[20:20] in the word of a past day Martin
[20:23] Luther's justification only gets you in
[20:26] one step today
[20:27] it put him in the body so when God moved
[20:31] on God moved on through the Old
[20:33] Testament Paul thought he was okay he
[20:35] was what persecuting Christians Brian
[20:38] persecute Brian was Paul bribed in God's
[20:41] mind absolutely Paul always was bribed
[20:43] but down here on the earth he was not
[20:45] right he was a sinner dead a dead center
[20:51] until God struck him down amen could you
[20:55] just stop for all these scriptures out
[20:56] there why did it wise the unclean spirit
[20:58] a lot of a man if it's not in you the
[21:03] Bible says the unclean spirit goes out
[21:05] of a man
[21:08] so it had to be there
[21:10] that older Demick nature everybody was
[21:13] born under everybody was born in saying
[21:17] shaping iniquity come to this world
[21:19] speaking live and see to me that way I
[21:21] can I can see that the blood of Jesus
[21:24] Christ saved my soul but then there's
[21:26] another part of this though I want more
[21:29] fellowship with God I want more
[21:32] manifestations in my life God said okay
[21:35] you got to do this you got to go up that
[21:36] statue of a perfect man that's why that
[21:38] the the first the faith of the fathers
[21:41] is we were talking about last night the
[21:42] faith of the fathers had these virtues
[21:44] working in their life Peter couldn't put
[21:47] it in the Bible if he had to live
[21:49] through it
[21:49] hey man Peter couldn't just start right
[21:53] well add to your faith virtue divert no
[21:54] Peter
[21:56] by all means Peter had some temper he
[22:00] knew God was working on that man and
[22:03] then even jesus said Peter I'm praying
[22:06] for you
[22:07] Satan is sifting you you know why cuz he
[22:12] was just like Paul Paul was one of
[22:14] Satan's best employees Paul was he was
[22:21] persecuting Christians he said himself
[22:23] in the Bible says I caused them to
[22:26] blaspheme I caused them what I Paul so
[22:37] you and I did the same thing you said no
[22:40] I didn't persecute the church you
[22:41] persecute Christianity by not being one
[22:46] why didn't I come to church when I was a
[22:48] sinner cuz I wasn't a Christian hey man
[22:52] I wanted to do what did ever want me to
[22:55] do you didn't oh well you must have been
[23:00] born in a bubble because I was like Paul
[23:04] I prefer to get employee but when God
[23:08] saved my soul he saved my soul I don't
[23:11] know about yours he saved my soul he
[23:14] burnt that old nature I was born with
[23:16] completely out and put himself in there
[23:19] hey man I responded to the word that
[23:25] before the foundation of the world God
[23:27] wrote this Bible amen
[23:29] God wrote the Bible before the
[23:32] foundation of the world knowing you
[23:34] would respond to a certain part of that
[23:36] scripture ethiopian eunuch reading the
[23:41] Old Testament who is this man talking
[23:43] about yeah
[23:44] his self or another right
[23:48] God just trench transporting Philip over
[23:53] Philip says let me tell you about this
[23:56] guy right you know why because the word
[23:59] had come alive in Philips heart it
[24:02] wasn't a hearsay hearsay he had
[24:06] experienced that come on so he could
[24:09] tell the Ethiopian eunuch and you know
[24:11] what listen I'm sorry but Philip was a
[24:14] little complacent he said I'm leaving
[24:15] I'll see you bye and if you'll be
[24:17] innocent I raised water right here some
[24:22] sparked in my lap you gonna baptize me
[24:24] before you leave remember fella was
[24:27] getting ready ladies okay I'm done think
[24:29] they'll be innocent oh no I don't think
[24:30] so while you here you gonna baptize me
[24:33] cuz you've shown me something I don't
[24:37] know where that comes from but that's
[24:38] good enough yeah come summer winds
[24:43] you're not still up here I'm rubbing all
[24:45] over the week but we're looking at full
[24:49] fellowship now though we are we have
[24:51] come to a place in the end time to where
[24:54] that garden like I said about the
[24:56] Thunder the Turner's the voice of God
[24:59] God come down into this dimension with a
[25:01] thunderbolt lightning come in and
[25:04] finally he says I'm here and now I got a
[25:07] group of people that'll really
[25:09] understand what I'm saying that don't
[25:12] excite you
[25:13] where'd it come from that don't excite
[25:16] you
[25:17] he should the end of the earth has come
[25:20] upon you and I
[25:21] but we've been equipped with more words
[25:25] than anybody in the whole time since the
[25:27] beginning of time
[25:28] how to handle this thing we have Satan's
[25:32] answer
[25:33] Sadie's answer is devil I know you used
[25:37] to be my friend I know that I have no
[25:40] you know iniquity is what iniquity is to
[25:45] say no he ain't in me I always was this
[25:47] great thing no you wouldn't you were
[25:50] lost why the Prophet have to go in the
[25:55] Pigpen and get holy go but if it's good
[26:00] enough for him was good enough for me
[26:02] but then the Prophet came and that's
[26:04] what he said yeah - sure he was born a
[26:07] prophet he had an anointing but he
[26:08] needed the Holy Ghost
[26:09] do you remember what he said he said I
[26:12] used to wash my car on Sunday now wait a
[26:15] minute I used to wash my car washed it
[26:18] watching people go to church did not
[26:20] what he said he'd go to church why he
[26:24] was a sinner he told you he was a sinner
[26:26] so what happens you say well why are you
[26:28] harping on this my salvation is the
[26:30] greatest thing than the greater than
[26:34] this world being made but there's more
[26:41] that just gets the baby here that just
[26:45] gets the baby out of the womb and then
[26:48] the baby starts to living in the finally
[26:51] the baby comes to a place to where he
[26:52] says I want to know more I like this
[26:56] milk but now I want to sandwich one my
[26:58] milk then I wanna oh that's a steak I
[27:02] think I want some of that too and
[27:04] there's some chicken where's jewel
[27:06] Forney when you need him there chicken
[27:09] hey listen chicken excites jewel for
[27:11] anyone cuz he likes chicken the Word of
[27:14] God ought excite you they see the you
[27:17] like it or you know but brings full
[27:20] fellowship in the manifestation so even
[27:22] down to all these church ages there was
[27:25] not full fellowship and then remember
[27:30] the Bible
[27:31] brother I mean census we says come out
[27:33] of her my people he said they couldn't
[27:34] get all the way out why they didn't have
[27:36] enough word to get out on Luther had
[27:39] just enough to get born again amen
[27:41] but that's why they were
[27:42] last night does the faith of the fathers
[27:44] brings us back not to full fellowship
[27:47] but it brings us back to a fellowship
[27:49] with God that no one else had but that
[27:52] really just gets you in tune which is
[27:55] the body to get you in tune with the
[27:58] head and the head stone coming was the
[28:01] opening of those seals and we'll read up
[28:03] here in just a little while look at
[28:05] number one but you have to get you know
[28:10] you have to get your days together and
[28:12] you have to get your time you have to
[28:13] see that that's the hand of God's and
[28:15] everything they man the hand of gods and
[28:18] everything we do but look see what it's
[28:22] doing is these seals opening up just
[28:24] begin to reveal the plan of redemption
[28:25] how we did it it's all over now just
[28:28] about just about finishing up so we're
[28:30] at the end time so that's why the things
[28:32] are being revealed there by all right
[28:35] with that say man now this when I read
[28:37] way back when we did the foundation and
[28:40] brother Lewis sent it to us yesterday
[28:42] and I want to read it again let's pull
[28:44] number two up this is in the breeze now
[28:48] when we go to break in these seals you
[28:50] going to see it goes plumb back in the
[28:52] scripture all the way back once you talk
[28:54] about back to Genesis alright back to
[28:56] Genesis alright
[28:57] the Bible don't go further in Genesis go
[29:00] Genesis did God created heaven the earth
[29:01] and the stars and the moons and all out
[29:03] okay all right
[29:05] that's when what that's when the thought
[29:07] of God was expressed just telling you
[29:11] what the Bible says it's the thoughts of
[29:13] God expressed the same with you you were
[29:16] thought in God's mind but listen it's
[29:18] like brother Dale always said and he
[29:19] didn't cover it last night I want him to
[29:20] say it so bad Judas was thought of God
[29:24] Hitler was thought of God but to be part
[29:28] of the one doing the thinking to be to
[29:32] be not a second person a man but if
[29:38] you're part of the one that wrote the
[29:40] book like brother Ram tops about the
[29:42] symphony all these little things that he
[29:44] tells us we're not just to fill up tape
[29:46] space amen
[29:49] because to get into with the conductor
[29:52] you can lead whatever you want to lead
[29:55] same way with the Bible if the one that
[29:58] wrote the Bible is inside me guess what
[30:00] there is no way I now I personally can
[30:04] hinder the work of the Holy Ghost
[30:06] a man grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[30:09] whereby you're sealed grieve not so you
[30:11] can grieve okay but what's inside of me
[30:13] is the word made manifest so I should be
[30:17] able to understand what the word says
[30:19] that's why the Ethiopian eunuch couldn't
[30:22] though he was a but though he was a
[30:25] potential Christian he wasn't Christian
[30:26] the timeyou potential Christian amen
[30:28] there was a seed laying there waiting
[30:31] but he took Philip the one with a live
[30:35] word to come and make that word alive to
[30:39] him
[30:39] I mean people how many of us read the
[30:42] Bible when we were sinners why we think
[30:48] we need it now that's all we feed off of
[30:51] why we found that that's what we come
[30:54] from not a dead letter on the page but
[31:01] the seed word quicken all right look for
[31:06] each one of those seals the whole thing
[31:07] together the whole mystery lays right
[31:09] here in these seals every mystery of the
[31:11] Bible lays in these seals in the seals
[31:13] cannot be broken until that time I'll
[31:15] prove it just admit now he's in the
[31:16] breeze right notice now the book
[31:21] remember is sealed here's one no it's
[31:24] what we're talking about remember before
[31:25] look this is the seal this is not the
[31:28] seal this is what's written this is the
[31:30] seal this is what's got this sealed up
[31:33] so you can't see it is that all right
[31:35] because look I'm gonna read to you right
[31:36] here now but notice the book remember
[31:39] it's sealed here's one here is this seal
[31:41] then another one's round
[31:42] a seal another one's wrapped to seal
[31:44] it's a book of redemption now the whole
[31:48] thing together makes the book and it's
[31:50] sealed with seven seals it's being on
[31:52] the back side is because it's wound
[31:54] around the seal mystery is on the inside
[32:00] and it only says look and it only says
[32:03] the wild horse rider or black horse
[32:04] rider whatever more on the white on the
[32:07] outside right this right here this is
[32:11] the seal but remember the complete plan
[32:14] of redemption is revealed in the seals
[32:18] this is the revelation listen
[32:22] it only took just a little bit of
[32:24] guidance for us to know that the white
[32:25] horse rider was the Antichrist amen I
[32:29] mean that had to break the seal had to
[32:32] come off the prophet had to come and
[32:33] tell us and put us in the right
[32:35] condition but remember everything after
[32:37] that though was what was inside this is
[32:40] the inside of the book alright remember
[32:43] I read the quote to you that it was the
[32:46] thunders and the seals is two different
[32:48] things this is the seal this is the
[32:50] thunder of the voice of God when the
[32:52] seal breaks this is the this is the
[32:53] thunder alright what he had sealed was
[32:55] was wild horse when he had sealed was a
[32:58] Red Horse and I'm gonna prove something
[33:00] to you just second which really came to
[33:02] me yesterday which I really enjoyed but
[33:04] listen I'm sorry I didn't read it on our
[33:08] black horse and whatever more on the
[33:09] outside but the mystery of the whole
[33:11] book is in themselves from Genesis to
[33:15] revelations a complete plan of what
[33:17] redemption is revealed in those seven
[33:21] seals and it's an important time God
[33:23] helps us to get it god help us to get it
[33:25] now because what did the seals do the
[33:28] seal showed your complete Redemption
[33:32] Israel's complete redemption amen
[33:36] the world's complete redemption and the
[33:39] defeat of Satan now what more do you
[33:43] want
[33:43] now he's defeated in your soul but I
[33:47] won't just got change amen that's what I
[33:55] want I don't know about you but that's
[33:57] what I want I want this guy changed amen
[34:00] cuz watch you think well now boy Roman
[34:04] isn't paganism all started right here in
[34:06] this angle man hang on man
[34:13] you know whether the deception really
[34:14] started now not yeah in the Garden of
[34:19] Eden but I mean when it comes down to
[34:20] earth right here to where we can see
[34:22] what it started from now we know it
[34:25] started as a deed went to a doctrine we
[34:27] know it started as a baby form and then
[34:29] he kept coming up we know it started as
[34:31] a wild horse rider what was the first
[34:33] deception under Romanism because
[34:36] remember Romanism brother Brown said you
[34:38] know don't worry about communism he said
[34:41] you better worry about Romanism amen
[34:44] watch what did they steal that tomb of
[34:47] Jesus is with a Roman seal he said
[34:53] what's that got to do anything when
[34:56] Jesus resurrected the first thing they
[34:58] said was he didn't say he's risen they
[35:04] said somebody stole his body when that
[35:07] Roman seal was broken ISM come out with
[35:10] a lot and told all the people in their
[35:14] part that hey they stole his body and
[35:17] they paid somebody to say that same
[35:24] thing today that Roman seal it's still
[35:30] here today they stole his body he didn't
[35:39] resurrect in there right so he carried
[35:44] right on in that demon just kept right
[35:46] going and he kind of hid a little bit in
[35:48] the first ages but he popped his head
[35:50] back up right here he said now he's he's
[35:54] not dead now he's a second person of a
[35:57] Trinity right that's what they said all
[36:04] Romanism amen
[36:07] I thought that was pretty good it was a
[36:10] Roman seal a Roman lie they started the
[36:12] whole thing off
[36:13] I said start the whole thing off and
[36:17] then but going back on was what it was
[36:20] that pure Church in the first stage that
[36:22] white righteous Church that was the real
[36:25] white righteous
[36:26] was on the earth´s at the time that's
[36:28] why Satan got on his white horse and
[36:30] attached himself to that same church and
[36:33] rode right down through there telling
[36:36] the people Jesus wasn't gone he couldn't
[36:41] have been that's what he says Suren
[36:45] theist there in the arena this time that
[36:51] Jesus was not gone until the River
[36:54] Jordan select doctrines old real old man
[36:59] real old I mean two thousand years old
[37:02] what it's done it's raised his head to
[37:05] see who agree with it then what happens
[37:07] is as you they push you back down well
[37:09] then all of a sudden he finds a weak
[37:10] spot he jumps right back up and then he
[37:15] goes down he jumps right back up same
[37:17] devil same thing with Hitler listen the
[37:21] the spirit that was on Hitler to kill
[37:22] the Jews it's the same spirit that was
[37:25] on Haman amen in the book of Esther
[37:29] Haman wanted all the Jews killed and
[37:32] what happened the great thing is the
[37:34] type of us is that is that when Esther
[37:37] went to the king and he said well now I
[37:40] can't change my word because you can
[37:46] read that Bible they'll judge and
[37:47] condemn you but I'm going to give but
[37:50] she said well what about this if you
[37:54] can't change it then give them something
[37:58] to defend herself with so you know what
[37:59] he did he said I'm going to tell them
[38:01] the very day it's going to happen and
[38:02] that they can take up arms and defend
[38:05] themselves and what did they do they
[38:07] destroyed Haman's army because they knew
[38:10] what was coming in at the same thing
[38:13] what the holy ghost does with you and I
[38:14] he's give us that power to know what the
[38:18] Devils doing to know what he's going to
[38:20] do thirty years from now if we'll just
[38:26] listen and then so let's review for a
[38:29] minute the white horse remember the wild
[38:30] horse was a white righteous Church Satan
[38:33] was a bluff and he went forth conquering
[38:36] in to conquer all right so we know that
[38:38] that was typed in the first
[38:40] three Church ages with a little bit of
[38:42] lap over amen
[38:43] like what we was talking about all right
[38:45] now let's some of you that have this
[38:49] sheet of paper you'll need to add the
[38:52] sheet that temps gave you later I added
[38:54] these quotes in so let's pull this one
[38:56] up right here and let's see we're going
[39:00] to we're going to finish a little bit of
[39:03] this because I'm still reviewing and I
[39:06] missed this and I want to go back to it
[39:08] because I think it's really important to
[39:10] see we've mentioned it before but now
[39:14] since today we got a little time we'll
[39:15] come back and review it because remember
[39:18] this is the book of redemption right
[39:20] this is the plan of redemption for us
[39:22] for Israel Jews you can call them
[39:24] whatever you want to call them I don't
[39:25] care I ain't gonna fight over why you
[39:27] call them people it's 144,000 that's
[39:31] going to be saved and a fifth seal Jew
[39:35] that's gonna be given eternal life so
[39:36] what you call them whatever you want I
[39:38] really don't care I really don't I'm
[39:41] worried about me I'm a Gentile whatever
[39:44] happens to them God's already done it
[39:46] for sealed side delivered you know what
[39:50] they're doing they're waiting on us to
[39:51] get out of the way so that's what we're
[39:53] trying to do we're fighting trying to
[39:55] get out of the way now let's get our
[39:57] sword out again now the word because
[40:01] remember we're heading toward the second
[40:02] seal where God get actually gave Satan a
[40:05] sword
[40:07] we'll read it in a minute
[40:09] and I appreciate brother Neville
[40:11] spiritual support as well as the
[40:12] brotherly love back here behind me
[40:13] praying for me you all out there now
[40:15] tonight being Friday night we'll just
[40:17] make it as you can't possibly hit all
[40:20] the things if you cause you to take that
[40:22] just one of those seals and stay just
[40:24] bring it right through the scripture
[40:26] right down see it takes months and
[40:28] months and months and you still wouldn't
[40:30] have it because the seal itself times
[40:32] the entire scripture from Genesis to
[40:34] Revelation one seal will try the entire
[40:37] Bible together why because it's the plan
[40:40] of redemption this Bible is the complete
[40:43] plan of redemption us the Jews the world
[40:47] and a defeat of Satan just like I said
[40:50] before all right so let's go to the next
[40:52] one this is the second one we added in
[40:54] six seal doesn't want you to see
[40:58] something then we're going to parallel
[41:00] here because I didn't do it in the first
[41:02] seal now the earthquake let's compare
[41:04] scripture this is the sixth seal if you
[41:06] got pencil on paper with you I want you
[41:07] to do something for me if you want to
[41:08] write write this because unless you're
[41:10] going to take the tape now I want you to
[41:12] read with me as you do compare
[41:14] scriptures of this great event that we
[41:16] will see that this great secret or
[41:18] mystery that was under the sixth seal of
[41:20] the book of redemption he's talking
[41:21] about 16 right now remember these are
[41:24] hidden mysteries and the sixth seals
[41:28] altogether is one great big book now you
[41:32] say oh brother around there seven seals
[41:33] now remember six seals is always wrote
[41:37] there is nothing wrote in the seventh
[41:39] seal except silence and brother branham
[41:41] he told us Christ is the seal
[41:44] Amen so Christ is not just in the book
[41:48] he is the book hey man and the six seals
[41:52] all together is one great big book just
[41:54] six Scrolls rolled together and unwinds
[41:57] the whole book of redemption that's how
[41:59] the whole earth was redeemed so six
[42:03] seals finishes Redemption remember
[42:08] brother emphasis six-foot sea not
[42:10] totally the quote but I'll read it later
[42:11] on six seals finishes finishing it and
[42:14] then the seventh seal brings Christ back
[42:16] to earth that's what he said in the
[42:17] seventh seal right so Christ is the seal
[42:21] redemption is over once that seeks hell
[42:25] breaks to you redemption is over because
[42:29] really the seventh seal guy Jesus Christ
[42:32] meets you on the opening in the first
[42:34] seal because he's the one with a book in
[42:36] his hand and man Jesus Christ is the one
[42:39] with a book in his end of the first Dale
[42:41] got it say man so now look if six sales
[42:48] finishes redemption for us then we've
[42:50] got to walk this thing through and I
[42:53] want to show you how to parallelize the
[42:55] six fold purpose of Daniel seventy weeks
[42:57] all right that Alright say ma'am
[43:00] because remember Daniel 9:24 says what
[43:03] let's read it
[43:06] seventy weeks are determined
[43:08] what thy people and the city member we
[43:12] went through dang of 70 weeks long time
[43:15] it's to two things the people and the
[43:19] city to do how many things six one
[43:23] finish transgression to make an end of
[43:25] sin three mate reconciliation for
[43:27] iniquity for bringing everlasting
[43:30] righteousness five seal up the vision
[43:31] and prophecy and six to north among holy
[43:34] there's your six fold purpose finishes
[43:37] Israel's Redemption and then there's no
[43:41] seventh in there was it because the
[43:42] seventh is on the scene at the time amen
[43:45] amen the seventh seal is on the scene at
[43:48] the time brother brown said ten one
[43:50] Christ one coming down being here
[43:54] because he's only one can open the seal
[43:57] but there's only six written seals
[43:59] there's only six full purpose of the
[44:01] redemption of Israel because you know as
[44:03] well as I do Daniel not damaged the Book
[44:04] of Daniel is the Book of Revelations to
[44:06] the Jews amen just like the Book of
[44:11] Revelations this to us that's the book
[44:13] of Revelation to the Jews because it
[44:14] tells them all the three and a half
[44:15] years and tell some all the things
[44:17] they're going to go through plus this
[44:18] right here seventy weeks are determined
[44:21] right then you see that there's three
[44:25] parts right what there's three parts a
[44:33] seven a 62 and the one a man a seven a
[44:42] 62 and the one that makes 69 that's why
[44:46] it doesn't matter to me you can tell me
[44:49] a thousand quotes where brother Brown
[44:51] said there's only three and half years
[44:53] left after the rapture he knows what
[44:55] he's talking about so do we
[44:57] because the Bible says there's one week
[44:59] left after the rapture so I don't have
[45:01] to go nowhere else I don't have to
[45:02] listen no great sermon from somebody
[45:04] else
[45:04] the Bible says there's one week left and
[45:06] when he shall make a covenant will mean
[45:08] for one week who's that he that's the
[45:10] guy we're talking about the devil that
[45:12] started he's not God could brother I'm
[45:15] saying God doesn't break the covenant he
[45:17] shall make a covenant with many for one
[45:19] we
[45:21] and when is that coming up May when
[45:23] we're gone so there's one week last
[45:26] after the rapture to finish the 70 weeks
[45:28] of Daniel to bring in this right here
[45:31] now people is the three-and-a-half holy
[45:33] cities the other three and a half hey
[45:35] man we've been through this all time but
[45:40] that's the great mystery of the people
[45:42] in the message don't see but if you
[45:44] don't get it right how can we bring the
[45:45] seals if you don't get it right you
[45:47] can't so there's one week left after the
[45:50] rapture all the earthly time cause of 60
[45:55] what 69 weeks are done you read in the
[45:57] Bible hey man 69 weeks for finish
[46:01] there's one week left there's seven
[46:03] years left after the rapture of the
[46:04] church to do what that right there
[46:09] that's what's gonna happen
[46:11] amen cuz luck if it's only three and a
[46:16] half years left after the rapture and in
[46:17] the 70 weeks of Daniel ends after that
[46:20] three and a half year ministry where
[46:24] you'll put all this that's got to come
[46:28] inside there because 70 weeks determines
[46:31] all this right here brother Bob said
[46:35] anoint the most holy was in the moon
[46:37] going in to the Millennium so it's got
[46:40] to be some time left people we know that
[46:43] we've all been through it brother Dale
[46:45] preached this in 1974 it should be just
[46:47] old hat for most of us amen alright so
[46:51] now look so now let's take a look at the
[46:55] six fold purpose let's take the first
[46:58] one now what we were talking at the
[46:59] first seal the first seal was a mystery
[47:01] of iniquity the first seal is under
[47:04] justification hey man we were justified
[47:07] not that you you did it yes you did it
[47:10] but your sins were forgiven your sins
[47:11] were put in the sea of God's
[47:12] forgetfulness now how does God go to
[47:15] redeem Israel they're condemned because
[47:19] what they even said we'll cover it in
[47:22] just a minute what we want we'll wait
[47:25] for next time but remember when they
[47:26] said ladies blood be on us and our
[47:27] children that's the second part that's
[47:29] what we're fixing to talk about cuz
[47:31] we're fixing to talk about red No
[47:33] we're going to a red horse hey man now
[47:37] look to finish the transgression to
[47:39] finish what to finish Israel's
[47:41] transgression just like me and you what
[47:45] is a transgression it's to go against
[47:47] something will you for God's when you as
[47:49] a sinner will you for God when you were
[47:53] a sinner no you weren't
[47:56] I'll just answer it for you no you
[47:58] weren't a transgression against me is to
[48:02] do a wrong to me transgress against you
[48:06] is to do the wrong to you so Israel did
[48:08] a wrong to God but you can say well we
[48:14] were trapped into us we were too so is
[48:16] Israel so was Israel he blinded their
[48:20] eyes he blinded them from going on just
[48:26] so you and I could come in Oh what about
[48:29] justification you were talking buddy now
[48:32] so Israel did it wrong to God and in
[48:36] this 70th week what's going to happen
[48:41] God's going to finish the transgression
[48:43] of Israel finish the transgression we'll
[48:46] be turning away the ungodliness from
[48:49] Jacob what's God going to do he's going
[48:52] to say I don't remember that no more
[48:56] amen
[48:57] because if he remembers that he's got to
[48:59] bring you back up amen same thing with
[49:03] you enough he remembers our sins he's
[49:05] got to bring it back up I love what
[49:07] brother Brown said I read it last night
[49:08] brother Brown said you put that under
[49:11] the blood he said I can't even see it
[49:13] he said if you'll put it on the blood he
[49:16] said not even I with his discernment can
[49:19] bring that out of your life why because
[49:20] God's going to go where'd you get that
[49:23] from because let me tell you something
[49:28] people when brother Branham was
[49:30] discerning that wasn't brother Branham
[49:32] that was the mind of Almighty God
[49:36] a man can't discern that perfect sure we
[49:41] could have feelings and and we could be
[49:46] right some of the time but he never was
[49:48] wrong why because it was God coming down
[49:50] and projecting that image right in front
[49:52] of him that's exactly what happened that
[49:57] wasn't hearsay that comes from the mind
[50:00] of God so that was truly God's speaking
[50:05] to us and he still speaks to us by the
[50:08] interpretation of the word finish the
[50:10] transgression will be turning away the
[50:12] ungodliness from Jacob and then all
[50:14] Israel will be born again amen
[50:19] all of them will receive the Holy Spirit
[50:23] hey man so six full purpose in the six
[50:26] seals hand in handle we'll see it in
[50:29] just two a while there by all rights a
[50:31] man we good with this
[50:34] don't hurt nobody's feeling I'm not here
[50:37] to hurt feelings so now look let's look
[50:41] real quick right here cuz we're not
[50:43] gonna be it is hot see some of y'all
[50:46] Fanning them sweating myself so now
[50:49] let's look now we've come through the
[50:51] first seal the first seal types the
[50:53] first three ages with a lap over because
[50:55] it stops at 6:06
[50:57] and it's the lion age lion li o n the
[51:02] lion age and then Satan rides right
[51:05] through that and becomes just like we
[51:06] read we're going to read it again maybe
[51:08] this evening maybe this morning
[51:13] revelations to where we saw where those
[51:16] seals went right into those church ages
[51:19] it became a deed sorry it became a
[51:23] saying then I hate and you hate that's
[51:25] what he said I'll reread it I hate it
[51:28] and you hate it by the time they come to
[51:29] the church third church age he said
[51:31] you've accepted it and I still hate it
[51:34] then we don't get to number four where
[51:37] says you now hold the doctrine of
[51:39] Jezebel wow that woman preacher
[51:49] hello now let's read the seal because
[51:54] we're coming right here this is the
[51:55] fourth this is the Ox age that all right
[51:58] lion ox man and Eagle the Ox age is what
[52:01] the burden it was a long church age very
[52:05] long it was from 606 to 1520 so it was
[52:11] you know close to a thousand years in
[52:14] this church age right here so the Ox age
[52:16] had to be a labor a bird bear had to
[52:20] just just barely made it through the age
[52:22] amen and when he had opened the second
[52:25] seal I heard the second beast say come
[52:27] and see
[52:27] now who's the second beast the Ox all
[52:30] right and there went out another horse
[52:32] that was red and power was given to him
[52:36] that sat thereon to take peace from the
[52:39] earth and that they should kill one of
[52:41] them the most the time when you killed
[52:43] somebody there's blood amen and there
[52:49] was given unto him a great sword or a
[52:52] great word we know that right
[52:55] and now we know that the fourth church
[52:58] age now watch the fourth church age goes
[53:03] in to perk of me in church age ends in
[53:07] 606 kind of strange that there was a
[53:09] nice teen Council in 606 somewhere right
[53:12] in there there was things being changed
[53:15] when 325 there was some things going on
[53:17] but he went from a deed to a doctrine
[53:20] and then when we go from come when we
[53:22] come out of that 606 and go into that
[53:24] for church age it becomes a Jezebel
[53:27] spirit but to have a powerful woman you
[53:37] got to have a powerful woman church to
[53:40] be on the scene he saw all they didn't
[53:42] they both they just bet brother Brown
[53:45] told us and I'll find it I couldn't find
[53:47] it this morning
[53:48] her brother Brown told us that the same
[53:51] anointing that those people in that
[53:53] fourth dimension used to overcome that
[53:56] age you and I use every day to overcome
[53:58] what's going on now so it's pretty pow
[54:00] fool to me you say it looked bad it
[54:03] didn't look bad to me God was on the
[54:06] scene doing what he was supposed to do
[54:07] he said if a corner week goes in the
[54:09] grounds got to go in the ground it's
[54:11] gotta go in the ground but when he comes
[54:14] back up we'll get into that with the
[54:15] other ages so now let's go and let's
[54:17] read revelations - like we did the other
[54:22] day that's all right don't get sleepy on
[54:27] me this morning heavenly days you'll
[54:28] never make it this afternoon people
[54:32] y'all will have to start jogging or
[54:33] something start to quit eating so much
[54:34] candy in the morning I know it hits us
[54:39] all but my lord you don't sleep when
[54:40] you're watching television and watching
[54:42] somebody other than that do you did I
[54:46] say that sorry
[54:48] hey it's whatever you want it's whatever
[54:53] you want if you have to set there with a
[54:56] pen and set that with a straight pin and
[54:58] poke yourself in the rear-end please do
[55:00] somebody might start shouting the truth
[55:11] all right let's go let's let's go to the
[55:14] Ephesian Church agent let's read this
[55:16] and then we'll this is heading us into
[55:18] the second seal you'll get that thought
[55:20] in your mind for this afternoon and then
[55:22] we'll start into the seal itself and
[55:23] read some quotes down through here
[55:25] because I wanted to I told them last
[55:27] night I was looking at this everything's
[55:30] red now we got a red horse a red brother
[55:33] branham even red as red is not good
[55:35] sometimes
[55:36] yeah we'll read it tonight red is not
[55:38] good stoplight warning but he said now
[55:43] when it's the blood-red blood of Jesus
[55:45] Christ he said it's the only thing that
[55:47] matters amen
[55:49] and the only thing they can sanctify you
[55:51] it's what the blood of Christ remember
[55:53] because back in the Old Testament the
[55:55] way they were
[55:56] what brought under that water of
[55:57] separation that's why they're waiting on
[55:59] the red heifer now they know they got to
[56:03] get that red heifer to go back over to
[56:04] Israel and start doing worship animal
[56:08] worship because really remember their
[56:11] Messiah had come yet that's why it's
[56:14] going to be the
[56:15] witnesses are going to come in that
[56:16] temple and they're gonna go why are you
[56:18] doing this that's why that I don't
[56:21] believe brother Brian I don't believe
[56:23] that the United States and Russia is
[56:24] gonna kill the 144,000 the Jew boys I
[56:27] don't mean that wrong I'm talking about
[56:29] the Jew boys that surround a litter
[56:31] nothing are gonna say what what do you
[56:35] mean we spent 2,000 years getting this
[56:38] heifer
[56:38] we spent 2,000 years getting this holy
[56:41] of Holy's back now you tell us that it's
[56:44] no good and they're gonna go yep -
[56:47] witness is gonna say you missed it back
[56:48] - in and you missed it now they're gonna
[56:50] get mad at them and kill them and then
[56:52] because where does all persecution come
[56:54] from within amen and you shall hear of
[57:00] wars this is matthew 24:6 let's read it
[57:03] first
[57:03] you shall have wars and rumors of wars
[57:05] now how many of you have ever seen or
[57:07] heard of a war that wasn't bloody
[57:10] bloodiest time of the world is a war
[57:13] shooting killing you understand the
[57:15] natural part for all these things must
[57:19] come to pass but the end is not yet
[57:21] so what's he telling him he said look
[57:22] we've still got some more church ages to
[57:24] go we've still got some more things we
[57:27] got to take care of amen
[57:29] so now we've got get my paper back again
[57:33] here so now we've got a red horse power
[57:38] was given to what take peace and kill
[57:40] and he was given a what a word because
[57:45] remember the Word of God was in power in
[57:48] these church ages we don't have them on
[57:51] here but it's like the we said it looks
[57:53] like somebody laying down but you got a
[57:56] lot of light a little more less a little
[57:59] more less than just a little bit a lot
[58:00] wow that's the Christian the black is
[58:03] what the opposition alright is that
[58:07] Alright so the Word of God was in power
[58:11] but what happens is these these
[58:14] doctrines I read you the quote last
[58:15] Sunday where the Holy Ghost has been
[58:18] bound for 2,000 years right here
[58:21] 2,000 years at the door of Creed's and
[58:25] dogmas
[58:26] right in this message but it's to be
[58:34] loosed by an endtime bride that'll
[58:36] listen to what's going on and listen
[58:40] what to what the Spirit says to the
[58:42] church hey man you got listening to what
[58:45] the Spirit says to the church so he was
[58:47] given a great sword then all right so

[1:06:13] going into yes we're going in the fourth
[1:06:18] age here watch and to the Angel of the
[1:06:20] church in sight I write these things
[1:06:22] saith the son of God who had his eyes
[1:06:25] like into flame of fire and his feet are
[1:06:26] like fine brass I know thy works and
[1:06:29] charity and service and faith and thy
[1:06:34] patience and thy works and the last to
[1:06:38] be more than the first in other words in
[1:06:40] that last stage when they really cuz
[1:06:41] they didn't start killing we'll read it
[1:06:43] in a minute they didn't start the
[1:06:45] Crusades and still until 1095 they
[1:06:51] started earlier but in 1095 is when all
[1:06:53] this other stuff starts piling up we'll
[1:06:56] read it in a minute because the age
[1:06:57] started 606 to 1520 the Crusades the
[1:07:01] Pope called in 1095
[1:07:04] called for a liberation of Christian
[1:07:10] when I we know what happened that wasn't
[1:07:14] God telling the Pope to do that but now
[1:07:21] look under that read what the
[1:07:23] sanctification what is what is
[1:07:24] sanctification cleaned and set aside for
[1:07:28] service amen
[1:07:31] so keep that in your mind because will
[1:07:33] not read that to the written this
[1:07:34] morning notwithstanding I have a few
[1:07:36] things against thee because thou
[1:07:38] sufferest that woman Jezebel they let
[1:07:40] that woman Jezebel come right in and
[1:07:43] they suffered her in other words they
[1:07:45] let her come right on in and they just
[1:07:48] said well that's okay let's accept this
[1:07:50] because what happened is during that
[1:07:52] time the Pope's and all the even
[1:07:55] Constantine and all them what they were
[1:07:57] putting church and state together amen
[1:07:59] listen they were putting church and
[1:08:01] state together and they suffered that
[1:08:03] woman Jezebel in other words they said
[1:08:04] okay it's all right we're going to
[1:08:06] accept father son Holy Ghost baptism
[1:08:07] okay we're going to accept the Trinity
[1:08:09] yeah there's purgatory yes see they
[1:08:11] started accepting that now that had
[1:08:14] nothing to do with God I was just
[1:08:17] reading in there where brother Graham
[1:08:18] said Columba the reason he chose Columba
[1:08:20] because Columba was as much against the
[1:08:23] Catholic Church as Martin Luther was he
[1:08:26] didn't go with any of that stuff we said
[1:08:30] which college to herself or prophetess
[1:08:33] well you think the Pope was gonna say
[1:08:35] I'm the devil you think his bishops are
[1:08:39] gonna say well we're the devlin we're
[1:08:40] going to deceive you know they're going
[1:08:43] to say we're of God they call herself a
[1:08:46] prophetess to teach him seduce my
[1:08:48] servants my servants to commit
[1:08:55] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[1:08:57] unto idols and I gave her space to
[1:09:00] repent of her fornication he gave that
[1:09:03] woman Jezebel and he served he gave
[1:09:05] Jezebel codes remember we were talking
[1:09:07] last night remember there are seven
[1:09:11] church ages in the Old Testament
[1:09:12] talk about that last night and I believe
[1:09:15] brother Branham said that Paul
[1:09:17] was chosen for the first church age
[1:09:19] because he was the what pattern
[1:09:22] messenger amen brother boards going
[1:09:25] through an insensitive class pattern
[1:09:27] messenger so whatever the church ages
[1:09:29] were patterned after they were patterned
[1:09:31] after Paul would not you think that the
[1:09:34] pattern messenger for the Old Testament
[1:09:36] would be Moses Moses everything
[1:09:42] patterned after Moses we read last not
[1:09:45] even in mouth I remember either law of
[1:09:47] Moses Amen so Moses was the pattern
[1:09:50] messenger for the Old Testament so he
[1:09:54] would be the first Church agent
[1:09:55] messenger to me in the Old Testament
[1:09:56] then you've got where Jezebel married
[1:10:00] who ain't how bad was did you and then
[1:10:04] he was a Jew when he married brother
[1:10:07] Graham said that's the dark ages of the
[1:10:08] Old Testament where church and state
[1:10:10] married each other she brought in what
[1:10:13] all them prophets are Bale she killed
[1:10:15] mother prophets but he lied you passed
[1:10:19] judgment on her he was given special ID
[1:10:23] you passed judgment remember he lied you
[1:10:26] didn't see or die
[1:10:28] get you type because remember we type
[1:10:31] Elijah amen Elijah's time for the bride
[1:10:36] we see Jezebel destroyed out here know
[1:10:42] it here in here we see Jezebel destroyed
[1:10:46] in here I gave her space to repent of
[1:10:50] her fornication and she repented not you
[1:10:53] know walk of the devil still thinks he's
[1:10:54] right behold I will cast her into bed
[1:10:57] now watch he cast her in the bed right
[1:11:00] here there was no denomination
[1:11:04] from here back this way because what our
[1:11:07] denominations the daughters of the
[1:11:12] Harley come on people the daughters of
[1:11:15] the harlot are the denomination oh well
[1:11:20] you believe it or not the only things
[1:11:21] what the Bible says what the Prophet
[1:11:23] said so he cast her into bed and then
[1:11:26] that commits adultery with her
[1:11:30] went into great tribulation except they
[1:11:33] repent of their deeds and I will kill
[1:11:36] her children with death
[1:11:43] there's your daughters
[1:11:45] they're to be destroyed in the end time
[1:11:48] I will kill her children with death and
[1:11:51] all the churches shall know that I am he
[1:11:54] which searches the reins and heart and I
[1:11:57] will give unto every one of you
[1:11:59] according to your words but until you I
[1:12:02] say unto the rest of Thyatira as many
[1:12:05] has have not this doctrine and which
[1:12:08] have not known the depths of Satan as I
[1:12:11] speak I will put upon you none of the
[1:12:13] burden in other words in that church is
[1:12:14] all you did like brother Aaron said all
[1:12:16] they did was said they were Christian
[1:12:18] born-again Christians they automatically
[1:12:20] died he said well that's a burden no son
[1:12:23] burden the burdens let you live we got
[1:12:26] to thinking wrong a burden to let you
[1:12:28] live but that which you have already
[1:12:33] hold fast till I come and he that
[1:12:37] overcometh and keepeth my works unto the
[1:12:40] end to him will I give power over the
[1:12:42] nation's he shall rule them with a rod
[1:12:44] of iron and the vessels of a Potter
[1:12:47] shall they be broken to shivers even as
[1:12:48] I receive him my father and I will give
[1:12:51] him the morning star God never forget
[1:12:53] him he said he that hath an ear let him
[1:12:55] hear what the Spirit says to the
[1:12:58] churches they men so we come down to
[1:13:00] where we got the Dark Ages in the Old
[1:13:02] Testament but then what's the seven
[1:13:05] churches in the Old Testament who shows
[1:13:07] up Elijah
[1:13:09] John the Baptist to introduce the
[1:13:13] introduced the head what the property
[1:13:16] God doing the seven churches come on the
[1:13:18] sin and the Elijah anointing to
[1:13:20] introduce the head and then so there's
[1:13:23] your churches in the Old Testament but
[1:13:25] you see these sails riding right through
[1:13:27] those showing every characteristic that
[1:13:30] the seals have are right there in the
[1:13:33] Bible amen so this afternoon we'll stop
[1:13:39] right there
[1:13:40] this afternoon we're going to see that
[1:13:41] this
[1:13:43] red horse rider he was sent forth now
[1:13:47] the first seal was to conquer set forth
[1:13:51] conquering and to conquer
[1:13:52] divide and conquer he ceased he's not
[1:13:54] physically dividing and conquering he's
[1:13:57] spiritually dividing and conquering I'm
[1:13:59] right you're wrong I'm right you're
[1:14:02] wrong if you're not in my camp you're
[1:14:04] wrong I'm right you're wrong that's what
[1:14:07] happened that's what's that but now look
[1:14:09] it took look how strong the Word of God
[1:14:13] people it took a thousand years for
[1:14:17] Satan to really come out and say let's
[1:14:19] have a denomination because God was
[1:14:23] trying to work with look patience I will
[1:14:26] not forget you he's in overcometh will I
[1:14:29] give all these things there was nothing
[1:14:31] that God finally said you know if it'd
[1:14:32] have been mere you they'd have been
[1:14:36] mirror you our patience will be about
[1:14:37] that thing and we'd go now get out of
[1:14:39] here yeah I've had enough of you get out
[1:14:42] of here no God said this is the way I
[1:14:44] want it this is the way I have to have
[1:14:47] it to show my pattern that the church
[1:14:50] had to go down at Nicaea start going
[1:14:53] down and go down in the ground where
[1:14:55] they killed 68 million Christians do you
[1:15:03] know that's a third of the population of
[1:15:05] the United States or a little bit a
[1:15:07] little bit less so we have two hundred
[1:15:10] and something or 300 million people Oh
[1:15:12] in there it's just like going to wiping
[1:15:14] out like Europe every person 68 million
[1:15:19] you don't think that was strong you
[1:15:20] don't think that was red it was blood
[1:15:23] everywhere but remember in our contrast
[1:15:27] we have Satan riding on a red horse
[1:15:30] killing people giving him a sword taking
[1:15:33] peace killing but we have God's saying
[1:15:37] look I've got to do this to wipe this
[1:15:40] thing off because sanctification means
[1:15:45] cleanse and set aside for service there
[1:15:50] was something coming out of Martin
[1:15:52] Luther and John Wesley that was going to
[1:15:54] start to church back up
[1:15:56] amen so he had to start with cleaner
[1:15:59] everything off and getting everything
[1:16:01] ready then this afternoon we'll talk
[1:16:04] about that sanctification under the
[1:16:07] Steel's let's stand our feet hope that
[1:16:12] was all right for you to to get a basis
[1:16:15] of what we're gonna do and then we'll
[1:16:18] we'll go a little further this afternoon
[1:16:21] appreciate the time to be able to do
[1:16:24] this but remember when that seal breaks
[1:16:27] we know we're not sealed breaks that
[1:16:29] there's a red horse rider and that red
[1:16:31] horse rider is going out and he's now
[1:16:35] got not just to conquer and be a bluff
[1:16:38] that was one point I was gonna try to
[1:16:40] make remember in the first church age he
[1:16:42] was a bluff bow and no arrows now he's
[1:16:46] got some ammunition he's got a sword and
[1:16:48] with that sword he's going to want kill
[1:16:51] people
[1:16:52] brother Brown said physically 68
[1:16:56] Millions unknown billions with this
[1:16:59] doctrine the doctrine is what come out
[1:17:02] that killed all the people that's what's
[1:17:05] killing us today folks the doctrine our
[1:17:08] own ideas is Kelce what's killing us hey
[1:17:11] man you love the Lord just pray for this
[1:17:14] afternoon we'll we'll get started on the
[1:17:17] sanctification under that seal but that
[1:17:19] original seal was in that Dark Ages
[1:17:21] Satan got off that white righteous horse
[1:17:24] and it just kept on going because it's
[1:17:28] still here today but he got on a red
[1:17:30] horse and he got mad he got mad because
[1:17:36] it wasn't working the way he wanted it
[1:17:39] working that first three church ages so
[1:17:41] he was going to now step out onto that
[1:17:43] red horse start riding and then he was
[1:17:46] going to have a sword in his hand and he
[1:17:48] was not going to just conquer he was
[1:17:50] going to kill cuz you can conquer a
[1:17:52] nation and not kill everybody but he's
[1:17:54] in the business to kill everything he
[1:17:56] wanted them all dead if it wasn't been
[1:17:58] for God holding that little remnant of
[1:18:00] people in that fourth church a saint
[1:18:03] would have wiped them all out under
[1:18:07] under the title of
[1:18:09] Christianity right that's what it is now
[1:18:13] under the title of Christianity Satan is
[1:18:16] killing people right amen
[1:18:21] but this afternoon we're gonna look at
[1:18:23] the red heifer and go back and see why
[1:18:24] she had to be red and while these things
[1:18:26] happen down through the Old Testament
[1:18:28] because brother Brown said you in top
[1:18:29] one silk and tie the whole Bible
[1:18:32] together we can go all the way back in
[1:18:34] the first Genesis 1 and we can come all
[1:18:36] the way down showing how God has done
[1:18:40] his work not our work is his work Jesus
[1:18:45] said thy will be done this thing so if
[1:18:50] you ever need for sinners slain
[1:19:15] give him more real people why do we give
[1:19:26] Him glory cuz we know now the full plan
[1:19:29] of redemption we know why those people
[1:19:31] cuz you know what we're gonna see them
[1:19:34] people we're gonna see them people in
[1:19:38] that for church age they won't be eat by
[1:19:43] lines anymore
[1:19:45] now they'll be standing just as perfect
[1:19:47] as you are
[1:19:48] [Music]
[1:19:54] but we'll be able to tell them why they
[1:19:57] had to go through that they went through
[1:20:00] that for me and you
[1:20:03] we can understand God more than any
[1:20:06] persons ever been on the earth floor
[1:20:10] here's a blood has the way you sing it
[1:20:17] one more time praise him down Oh
[1:20:23] and will praise Him
[1:20:29] I will parade
[1:20:32] great
[1:20:34] and for sinners late
[1:20:39] thank you Lord give him glory only
[1:20:49] people for his blood has washed away
[1:20:58] Easter amen
[1:21:01] you know something to think about this
[1:21:03] afternoon that sanctification that you
[1:21:06] came through will read it and I remember
[1:21:11] going through it just plain as day where
[1:21:13] the unclean spirit goes out of a man you
[1:21:15] just feel so empty you feel like that
[1:21:16] demons not going to ever come get you
[1:21:18] again
[1:21:18] but now read to you where brother
[1:21:20] Branham said if you don't fill it up
[1:21:21] with something because remember in the
[1:21:24] analogy of the jar the jar you know God
[1:21:27] picks the jar up it's dirty and nasty on
[1:21:29] the inside and out picks it up out of
[1:21:31] the mud pit and says I'm going to use
[1:21:33] this that's justification whatever it
[1:21:35] happened down here that's gone I have
[1:21:37] brought it to a place I'm gonna use and
[1:21:40] then then what does he do he goes in to
[1:21:44] his water pot washing of the water by
[1:21:49] the word washes it out amen
[1:21:55] but it's it still got a hold on the top
[1:21:59] you can still get mud back in it you can
[1:22:02] put poison in it you can put all kind of
[1:22:04] things in because it's just cleaned and
[1:22:06] set aside for service right but you got
[1:22:12] to fill it with something like and there
[1:22:15] was God knew he seals it there's the
[1:22:18] Holy Ghost he seals that and saying
[1:22:21] can't get in
[1:22:25] you're sealed that's the seal but the
[1:22:29] sanctification part is to cleaning out
[1:22:31] and getting it ready to be used God is
[1:22:34] saying okay this thing's dirty I'm gonna
[1:22:37] wash it by the water of the word amen
[1:22:41] but when the unclean spirit goes out of
[1:22:43] a man walks in Dry places seeking rest
[1:22:45] find this nun comes back to the house
[1:22:48] finds it swept and garnished and says I
[1:22:52] think I'll make him religious I'll put
[1:22:57] him in a message church and make him
[1:22:58] believe that God sent a prophet he comes
[1:23:04] right back in and makes you seven times
[1:23:06] worse than you were when you started I'm
[1:23:09] gonna tell you some people if you're not
[1:23:10] born again if you did not go through I'm
[1:23:12] gonna tell you this if you did not go
[1:23:14] through a definite stage of
[1:23:18] justification a definite stage of
[1:23:21] sanctification you're not born again now
[1:23:27] when Satan fills you up with a religious
[1:23:29] spirit what do you do you come to church
[1:23:32] you come to church you're saying you
[1:23:41] worship you might preach say it's a good
[1:23:46] preacher you know but that's the problem
[1:23:49] with this hour most people take that and
[1:23:52] that's there
[1:23:54] you're full of something today one way
[1:23:57] or the other
[1:23:58] amen now even when God seals it
[1:24:02] God seals it with the Holy Ghost we're
[1:24:08] on the outer Court again we got to go
[1:24:11] right back up to there now it's not a
[1:24:13] it's not a washing like the first one
[1:24:16] you know washing away cuts and smoking
[1:24:18] drinking and committing adultery you're
[1:24:20] washing away your knowledge and taking
[1:24:23] God's knowledge you're washing away a
[1:24:26] little bit of that temper that you still
[1:24:27] got and put guards temperance brother
[1:24:31] Bob said ain't got enough patience to
[1:24:34] wait you know what he said he said wait
[1:24:37] on God
[1:24:38] have patience the way don't God and go
[1:24:42] up that statue of a perfect man sure
[1:24:43] you're sealed that's what I just said
[1:24:44] but we're sealed our soul is sealed but
[1:24:48] going up the Statue of a perfect man God
[1:24:49] is still what burning out the trash
[1:24:52] sister Sheppard's dream remember there
[1:24:55] was still trying out he told he said
[1:24:57] you're born again right but they were
[1:24:59] still trash coming out we still have
[1:25:01] trash yes we still have trash called
[1:25:05] that spirit strong but now look that
[1:25:09] right there is where we're heading to
[1:25:11] where you are sealed as a total unit and
[1:25:16] you just as eternal as God is body
[1:25:20] spirit and soul can't happen brother
[1:25:24] you're an unbeliever that's why we're
[1:25:27] still here we are not believing what's
[1:25:29] already been said amen we just are not
[1:25:34] believing everything that God wouldn't I
[1:25:36] believe that God can just can't clean me
[1:25:39] up brother and clean my soul up and give
[1:25:41] me a new car
[1:25:43] but can I have the same talks of Jesus
[1:25:45] head oh I can't
[1:25:50] don't start that I can't business
[1:25:53] remember the three things you can't
[1:25:56] overcome is can't couldn't and wouldn't
[1:26:00] you can't overcome that I can't I
[1:26:03] couldn't do that I wouldn't do that you
[1:26:07] overcome in three and God can work on
[1:26:09] you because that's what he's doing he's
[1:26:11] working up this Way's working on the
[1:26:13] outside man he's working on the memories
[1:26:14] and conscious Vixen imagination of man
[1:26:16] that's what this is doing why
[1:26:20] so let that Holy Ghost that created the
[1:26:22] world you know I was telling you the
[1:26:24] other day I don't think but when we were
[1:26:26] in Alabama I preached on bringing in the
[1:26:31] soul of God and the different things and
[1:26:32] and brother Matthew was just having a he
[1:26:36] was having a Holy Ghost filled time
[1:26:39] letting me brother brother above still
[1:26:41] talking about it because he really never
[1:26:44] solved it then and I don't I'm just
[1:26:47] gonna say this that really that's what
[1:26:49] come to you new birth it's not a it's
[1:26:51] not a Holy Ghost that just as well it's
[1:26:54] God Himself not a third person it's the
[1:26:59] creator they said I'm moving in and
[1:27:03] saying you're moving out there to me
[1:27:09] that's Redemption I was lost but now
[1:27:13] fell by the Creator by the God that
[1:27:17] created everything he resides in me
[1:27:23] and I now control what comes out you
[1:27:31] control grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[1:27:35] God program said you can grieve him
[1:27:38] he'll go out on a limb he's a gentleman
[1:27:40] he said okay
[1:27:41] remembering that's why we're talking but
[1:27:43] the brother they're bringing an adoption
[1:27:45] what is he what his brother Bram used as
[1:27:47] an example for adoption
[1:27:48] he says the Holy Ghost comes down and
[1:27:52] looks at the child goes back to the
[1:27:56] father and says he's not acting like you
[1:27:59] now we know that's a drama but that's
[1:28:02] was actually what happens in adoption
[1:28:06] when when dust was about five years old
[1:28:09] he and drive your cars did he why he was
[1:28:13] a human yeah no he was a human though he
[1:28:17] had fight he had five fingers on he tell
[1:28:19] you right here he had a brain why did he
[1:28:23] drive the car he was the son of Mark
[1:28:26] action rock but why did mark getting the
[1:28:28] keys because he wasn't mature enough to
[1:28:31] handle the situation that was coming but
[1:28:34] as he grew up in God God handed him the
[1:28:39] keys God hands you the teeth that's why

[1:28:54] your choice though we're trying our best
