[12:04] now we know that he was talking to his
[12:06] disciples here but it wasn't just a word
[12:08] for his disciples amen it's a word for
[12:11] each and every one of us
[12:13] if ye keep my commandments
[12:16] ye shall abide in my love
[12:19] amen it's the only way that you can keep

[13:49] commandment you fulfill that law you may
[13:52] be seated this afternoon this evening
[13:55] praise the lord jesus
[13:58] amen so um
[14:02] if the brothers can bring the the first
[14:04] picture up
[14:06] um
[14:07] and you can blow it up that'd be great
[14:10] so you all pray for us this this this
[14:13] sunday is brother wade he'll be out and
[14:15] he'll be ministering we'll be in orlando
[14:17] florida
[14:19] preaching as well
[14:20] ministering
[14:22] to to a group there a little group from
[14:25] el salvador
[14:26] and uh it's
[14:28] their meeting there and so they asked us
[14:30] if we could if we could visit them so
[14:33] we're gonna do that so you just pray for
[14:35] us
[14:36] and um
[14:37] also uh
[14:38] pray for us as well on november the
[14:40] sixth and the seventh we'll be
[14:42] ministering in jacksonville florida
[14:44] as well
[14:46] and then lord willing on november the
[14:47] 30th we'll be heading to central america
[14:51] for a seven week mission trip
[14:54] so it'll be about what month and a half
[14:57] something like that
[14:58] almost two months
[15:00] so i wanted to uh to kind of show you
[15:03] all we'll be leaving november 30th and
[15:05] it probably won't be back till like
[15:06] january the 18th so you all remember us
[15:09] in prayer
[15:10] i'm just trusting that everything goes
[15:12] well before and now and then
[15:15] there's so many changes going on in this
[15:18] world you just don't know what's going
[15:19] to happen
[15:20] between now and then
[15:22] but uh that's the plan well we already
[15:24] have our tickets to leave out november
[15:26] the 30th and we'll be heading to
[15:27] honduras first
[15:29] so this is uh the area where we're going
[15:31] to be going out so that you'd know
[15:34] um
[15:35] up here that up at the top right hand
[15:37] corner is florida
[15:39] and mexico so central america is right
[15:42] here
[15:42] um i know some people don't don't know
[15:45] where central america is and so
[15:47] this will kind of give you a little bit
[15:49] as to where there's the united states
[15:51] right there central america is right
[15:53] there and that's my home country right
[15:55] down there in south america so this
[15:57] strip right here central america will be
[15:59] in honduras nicaragua and costa rica
[16:02] lord willing
[16:04] next next slide
[16:06] so there's um
[16:10] we'll be uh this is what we'll be
[16:12] landing
[16:13] in honduras in san pedro sula
[16:16] and um
[16:18] we'll be in honduras mostly in this area
[16:20] right here and so where i have the
[16:22] little squiggly lines
[16:25] in those areas right there
[16:27] there's a lot of uh we're going to be up
[16:29] in the mountains a lot in those areas
[16:32] so there's there's a lot of there's
[16:34] different brothers that um
[16:37] that have um that go to these different
[16:40] areas
[16:41] uh and they do mission work and they
[16:43] work with the people there
[16:45] and of course they they need they need
[16:46] help you know any help that you can give
[16:48] them you know is is
[16:51] it's wonderful so
[16:53] i've i've been asked personally by a
[16:55] brother for two years to come and visit
[16:57] him from that area and to get to his
[17:00] church you have to walk like five hours
[17:02] up in the mountains
[17:03] nobody visits them
[17:05] but he's he's got a church over there
[17:07] and so
[17:09] so he told me two years ago because him
[17:11] and his family uh walked to a a youth
[17:15] camp that we were at
[17:16] for about two hours
[17:18] and so they they um he said yeah brother
[17:21] we'll be more than glad to have you we
[17:23] would love to if you come visit us we
[17:25] don't have anybody to visit us
[17:28] so you see the brothers that come from
[17:29] the states they'll go they go down there
[17:31] and they visit the the known churches
[17:34] and the churches in the cities but these
[17:36] brothers up in the mountains they never
[17:37] get visited harley
[17:40] so that is my purpose for this trip to
[17:42] go out and visit these little places you
[17:44] know that don't get visited
[17:46] hardly at all they need to be you know
[17:48] they need some encouragement from from
[17:50] here too
[17:53] so um
[17:54] so lord willing we'll be doing that and
[17:57] um and after that we'll be here around
[18:00] uh pretty much the month of december
[18:03] and then coming down here this is
[18:04] nicaragua now
[18:06] and then from here um lord willing we'll
[18:10] be we'll be traveling all the way to the
[18:12] east coast of nicaragua
[18:14] this is a 12-hour trip
[18:17] right here
[18:18] and this in this area right here it's
[18:21] it's a group called the mosquitos
[18:23] not mosquitoes but the mosquitos
[18:27] they they have their own dialect they
[18:30] it's like a it's like a fusion between
[18:32] spanish and something else so when you
[18:34] preach there you actually need an
[18:35] interpreter
[18:36] and there's an interpreter there's a
[18:38] brother interpreter over there
[18:41] so we'll be traveling with some of these
[18:42] brothers back to that area and probably
[18:44] be there maybe for
[18:46] for maybe a week and a half or two
[18:49] and uh
[18:51] now you all just just pray for me
[18:53] because some of these places where i'm
[18:55] going to be going to this time around
[18:57] the really
[18:58] rugged areas and really
[19:00] uh bad areas and it's actually areas
[19:03] that even my wife is not going to be
[19:04] able to go to
[19:06] actually the brothers they recommended
[19:07] that
[19:08] don't bring your your wife don't bring
[19:10] your daughters because it's gonna be
[19:12] pretty rough terrain so
[19:14] so you all just pray for us amen that
[19:17] there'll be no snakes or anything like
[19:19] that
[19:21] but um uh so from there lord willing
[19:24] we'll be heading back back to to this
[19:26] area right here and then and then we'll
[19:28] be traveling down to
[19:30] finish their trip off in january in
[19:34] costa rica
[19:35] in san jose costa rica up in that area
[19:38] and we'll probably be there for about a
[19:39] week a week and a half and then from
[19:40] there we travel back
[19:43] so
[19:44] you all just pray for us because that's
[19:46] all that all can change
[19:48] but um
[19:49] but that is the plan for now that is the
[19:52] plan for now
[19:53] um next slide
[19:58] now i show these picture and the little
[20:02] little boy there he's a
[20:04] he's naked of course
[20:07] and uh
[20:08] he has no clothes i tried to cover up
[20:11] what i could
[20:13] but uh
[20:15] this is some of the areas where
[20:18] i'm i don't i don't know if i'm going to
[20:19] get to visit uh this time around these
[20:22] areas but some of these some of these
[20:23] places as you can see these these kids
[20:25] they don't even have clothes to wear
[20:28] um
[20:30] next slide
[20:33] and you can you can kind of tell you
[20:34] know they got their little bulging
[20:36] bellies you know the little
[20:38] the little bellies that
[20:40] they're hungry
[20:41] they don't have they don't have a lot to
[20:42] eat
[20:43] some of them have some clothes some of
[20:45] them don't this brother right here this
[20:46] is brother eli
[20:48] he's a he works
[20:51] he's a missionary there in the in in
[20:52] honduras
[20:54] and he works in those areas a lot
[20:57] and he says brother these people are
[20:58] just the poor of the poor
[21:00] they're so poor that
[21:02] that these brothers they give those
[21:04] families in those areas clothes for them
[21:06] to wear
[21:08] and they
[21:09] they end up just selling the clothes so
[21:11] that they can buy food
[21:12] and that's one of the reasons why they
[21:14] they don't they they can't you know
[21:16] their children walk around some of them
[21:18] walk around nude
[21:19] next next slide
[21:22] this brother right here these pictures
[21:24] were just sent to me recently this is
[21:25] the same location
[21:27] this brother right here is getting ready
[21:29] to be married
[21:30] to the sister right here
[21:34] and if you if you could tell you know
[21:36] the p if there was more detail but you
[21:38] could see his shoes i mean they're
[21:39] they're just tattered
[21:41] um
[21:43] but
[21:44] they they already got married by this
[21:46] you know by the by the by the country
[21:49] but civil a civil wedding so next month
[21:52] they're going to have a an actual
[21:54] wedding at the little church
[21:56] but of course they don't have any he
[21:58] doesn't have any money to buy himself a
[22:00] uh something to wear she doesn't have
[22:03] anything to wear
[22:04] for the for the
[22:06] wedding gown
[22:07] so some of us brothers we pitched in to
[22:09] kind of help them buy some something so
[22:12] that they can have their little wedding
[22:14] i just sent that money last week to them
[22:17] and some other brothers from the from
[22:18] the country also helped out and also for
[22:21] them to be able to have a little a
[22:22] little you know get together afterwards
[22:24] a little thing food for the people
[22:28] but this sister right here if you can if
[22:30] you can go to the next slide
[22:32] that's the same sister right here you
[22:34] can see she's barefooted
[22:37] they tell me the brother tells me that
[22:39] every time they go visit her she's
[22:42] always wearing the same clothes
[22:44] and so the brother is telling he's like
[22:46] well last time we were here we brought
[22:48] you clothes what what happened he said i
[22:50] had to sell them i had to sell them
[22:52] because i need to feed my family
[22:55] i need to feed so um
[22:58] so you all just remember see remember
[23:00] those those families in prayer
[23:03] and yet they're still trying to be
[23:05] faithful going to church you know uh
[23:08] next slide
[23:10] that is that is i believe this is the
[23:12] the little church right here in the area
[23:14] and then this is the pastors or the the
[23:17] the pastor's house
[23:19] and uh
[23:21] that's where he lives
[23:22] right there and uh it's high
[23:25] it's because they're near the ocean so
[23:28] it floods a lot in those areas but they
[23:31] tell me it's just a very very poor area
[23:33] so next slide all right so that was
[23:37] honduras that was in honduras this right
[23:39] here is nicaragua now um
[23:43] last year i don't know if some of you
[23:45] brothers i had asked
[23:47] for some help for for this church right
[23:49] here because they had just bought a
[23:51] piece of land
[23:53] to build because this little area right
[23:55] here where they were congregating at
[23:58] uh it's the people are growing and they
[24:01] have no more space now
[24:03] so uh next slide
[24:06] this is the little area this is the
[24:08] little area where they're holding the
[24:09] services i've preached there before
[24:11] and uh just wonderful people the place
[24:14] is called monte tabor nicaragua next
[24:16] slide
[24:19] and it's up up on a kind of up on a hill
[24:22] so what they did is they they just built
[24:23] a little space right there so they can
[24:26] meet right next to someone's home
[24:28] and that's why you see it's kind of it's
[24:30] almost like a little garage
[24:32] type of thing
[24:33] next
[24:36] that's then meeting next slide
[24:41] and uh yeah that's best from looking
[24:43] from behind
[24:44] from the back of the church
[24:47] next slide
[24:50] next
[24:53] next
[24:55] all right so here this is uh so
[24:58] by the grace of god last year we were
[25:00] able to help them out with the down
[25:01] payment to buy the uh the the the piece
[25:04] of land
[25:05] the the piece of land cost them eight
[25:07] thousand dollars
[25:09] and so we were able to help them buy the
[25:11] uh the land we i think we gave them like
[25:14] 1200 or something like that for the down
[25:16] payment 1500 something like that
[25:19] they got it down now to about uh 5 000
[25:22] now that they need to pay off so
[25:25] um
[25:26] the brothers are just asking they have
[25:28] not built a church there yet because
[25:30] what they want to do is they
[25:32] is they want to finish paying this loan
[25:34] off
[25:35] so that they can continue you so that
[25:37] they can start building the church
[25:39] and uh so they don't look bad to the
[25:41] people that they bought the land from
[25:43] they have a certain uh determinate
[25:45] amount of time
[25:46] so you all just pray for for for these
[25:48] brothers that uh
[25:50] they'd be able to pay it off uh sooner i
[25:52] think i think i can't remember the time
[25:54] frame that they gave them but they have
[25:56] about five thousand dollars that they
[25:58] need left to pay off so
[26:00] if you feel in your heart that you want
[26:01] to help out with that
[26:03] they would certainly appreciate that
[26:05] next slide
[26:09] this is them
[26:10] um in that same area next slide
[26:14] all right and this this is part of the
[26:15] group there this is brother allen and
[26:17] he's also he's a missionary there in
[26:19] nicaragua he goes all over nicaragua but
[26:22] he's the one who is helping built this
[26:24] group up there in nicaragua he's kind of
[26:27] spearheading this work over there
[26:29] so
[26:30] he's he's the one who's asking prayer
[26:32] for for for the little for this group
[26:34] their next slide
[26:36] and then this is more or the more of
[26:39] them i is that it
[26:43] okay so now yeah so now what they've
[26:45] done is they've they've built just for
[26:48] space sake they've built just a little
[26:50] temporary little hut type thing on that
[26:53] in the area where they where they where
[26:55] they purchased the property
[26:57] and so they can meet and they'd be able
[26:59] to have more space instead of being
[27:01] cramped up in that little other area
[27:03] next
[27:04] slide then this that's them right there
[27:08] but eventually they want to build their
[27:10] own church in that in that spot so
[27:13] you all just i think that's the last
[27:15] slide
[27:16] so y'all just remember that in prayer
[27:18] that is one of the places that i i want
[27:20] to go visit when we go over there and
[27:23] just kind of take pictures of the area
[27:25] and just
[27:26] report back
[27:27] and some of you all helped out with that
[27:29] with that with that church there
[27:32] and
[27:33] remember us in your prayers amen
[27:36] my desire is to just be able to help
[27:39] amen amen and uh in whatever way we can
[27:42] we can't we can't do anything i mean we
[27:44] can't do everything right you know but
[27:47] what little we can do amen and and we we
[27:50] will be more than willing to do
[27:52] and you know my wife and i we we
[27:56] i thank god that god gave me a wife who
[27:59] who loves to
[28:01] go on trips
[28:02] like that with me
[28:04] and
[28:06] that's been my desire you know to just
[28:08] just
[28:09] be on the mission field and it just
[28:11] breaks my heart just see these little
[28:12] kids like that you know and just
[28:15] and you wish you could just do something
[28:16] for them right there and then but
[28:19] the best thing you can do is we pray for
[28:21] them amen
[28:22] pray for them and uh
[28:24] and send who you if you can't go brother
[28:26] i'm saying to send somebody
[28:28] man if you can't go you just send
[28:30] somebody so
[28:31] so we just thank god for that so you all
[28:33] remember us in your prayers in the next
[28:35] coming weeks as we'll be prepping for
[28:37] that lord willing
[28:39] amen so
[28:40] let's go and let's look at this here and
[28:43] i promise i'm not going to keep you all
[28:45] along tonight so we're going to move
[28:47] here a little quick so
[28:49] if you remember in the last two services
[28:52] last two parts when we were talking
[28:53] about this um
[28:56] we were talk we were bringing it out of
[28:57] john chapter 13.
[29:00] i'm trying to shift my mind here now
[29:03] from mission missions now to the word
[29:06] and uh we were preaching out of john
[29:08] chapter 13 and we were we were looking
[29:10] at john chapter 13
[29:12] and if you remember how what jesus was
[29:15] this was just a few nights it was real
[29:19] right before he was betrayed and right
[29:21] before he
[29:23] he uh he went to the garden of
[29:24] gethsemane and went on the cross
[29:26] and he was there with the disciples and
[29:29] we all know we all read the story we
[29:30] know what the story is and we see how
[29:33] the
[29:35] how
[29:35] judas was there and how satan had
[29:38] entered him and and and and he did and
[29:43] what he did was and jesus didn't didn't
[29:46] argue with him he just said you know i
[29:48] know what you're going to do so you just
[29:49] go ahead and do it
[29:52] and sometimes you know uh
[29:54] you don't have to argue with anybody you
[29:56] know just
[29:57] let them
[29:58] do what they need to do amen
[30:00] uh they're gonna go one way just let
[30:02] them go i think the best way that we can
[30:05] that people learn their lessons better
[30:06] is to just let them make their own
[30:08] mistakes
[30:09] let them learn their own mistakes
[30:11] and they realize then okay what am i
[30:14] doing
[30:15] you know
[30:16] now it just depends on what it is but
[30:18] most of the times you know that's that's
[30:20] at least that's how i was
[30:23] i make my own mistakes then i learned my
[30:24] own lessons you know then they stay they
[30:27] stay
[30:28] but if you try to push somebody
[30:31] won't you do this do this and that and
[30:33] they don't want to do it you're not
[30:34] going to get them to do anything
[30:36] just let them make their own mistakes
[30:38] let them have their own experience
[30:41] and that'll that'll teach them more let
[30:43] god teach them not necessarily you teach
[30:46] them
[30:47] let god teach them
[30:48] of course you know we as parents and we
[30:50] as uh as leaders you know we try to do
[30:53] and direct as much as we can
[30:56] but ultimately it's that person's choice
[30:59] i hope to you can take your children up
[31:01] to a certain point after that it's got
[31:03] to be god to do it then
[31:05] amen it's got to be if when god does it
[31:07] amen he does it good
[31:10] when we try to do it it never gets done
[31:12] or it gets done halfway
[31:16] and most of the time it's it just
[31:18] doesn't get done but when he does it he
[31:20] does it perfect amen
[31:22] and i don't know why i want to say that
[31:24] but uh that's that wasn't even in my
[31:26] notes
[31:28] it's just like brother wade by the way
[31:30] you was preaching sunday
[31:33] all kinds of things that we were talking
[31:34] as a family all last week
[31:37] and so you're you're you're saying
[31:39] somebody must needed this i
[31:41] see that's god that's the holy spirit
[31:43] just confirming those things
[31:45] even the night before we were having a
[31:47] little devotion at the house and brother
[31:48] wade was bringing things out sunday
[31:50] morning or sunday afternoon i believe it
[31:52] was
[31:53] exactly what we had talked about the
[31:54] night before
[31:56] i hadn't talked to brother wade i hadn't
[31:58] you know it was just that's that's god
[32:00] that's the god that we serve amen he
[32:03] comes to confirm his word
[32:05] and he does it in supernatural ways and
[32:07] when he does it those ways those ways
[32:09] stick
[32:10] but when it's planned and it's pushed
[32:12] and it's shoved you know it never sticks
[32:15] it never sticks
[32:17] amen praise god so we were looking there
[32:19] in john chapter 13
[32:20] and uh we got to a point where jesus
[32:23] told uh judas hey just go go ahead and
[32:25] do what you need to do of course judas
[32:28] he left and went out the door
[32:31] and we talked about that
[32:33] a little bit in regards to uh how in the
[32:36] last days and the days that we're living
[32:38] in now the love of many shall wax cold
[32:40] if you remember that and we're seeing
[32:42] that now more than ever
[32:44] amen we're seeing how the love of people
[32:47] are as wax and cold amen and the the the
[32:50] situations that are taking place
[32:52] politically and in in the world amen
[32:55] it's causing people because they look at
[32:57] those things more than they look at the
[32:59] word it's causing the love of people to
[33:01] fall
[33:03] you know some of us we don't like to
[33:04] hear that but that's exactly what's
[33:06] happening
[33:07] because we look to the news we look to
[33:09] the media we look to the to the
[33:11] government so much amen it's causing us
[33:14] amen to real to forget where we come
[33:17] from
[33:18] our position amen and our position is
[33:20] not of this world
[33:22] we live in this world but we're not of
[33:24] this world so we don't need to act like
[33:27] the world amen praise god so so the love
[33:31] of because
[33:32] iniquity is abounding the love of many
[33:35] shall wax cold the bible says now
[33:39] we talked we we talked about how
[33:41] it the love wouldn't go away completely
[33:44] but it would wax cold
[33:46] it would get it would dwindle
[33:48] amen if we're not careful if we let the
[33:50] things of this life if we if we if we
[33:53] neglect this word amen we will allow
[33:55] that love amen for each other the love
[33:58] for god the love for his word the love
[34:00] for coming the church amen it will
[34:02] dwindle more and more and
[34:04] more if we're not careful
[34:07] praise god
[34:09] and and any and then and in talking
[34:11] about that i wanted to read a quote real
[34:13] quick where brother branham
[34:14] something interesting that i found uh or
[34:16] brother branham talks about in the third
[34:19] and church age
[34:20] if the brothers could bring this up it's
[34:22] the first quote i think that i put yes
[34:24] he says here i want to give you a
[34:25] warning right here it says concerning
[34:28] the last days that because of abounding
[34:30] iniquity the love of many will wax cold
[34:34] in the layer to sin or last age
[34:37] self love and love for material things
[34:40] will take the place of the true love of
[34:42] god
[34:45] amazon wouldn't have done good back in
[34:47] the 19 early 1900s amazon does good now
[34:51] ebay does good now it wouldn't be good
[34:54] back then in the early 1900s because the
[34:57] materialistic mindset of people
[35:00] you see so that's it it works hand in
[35:02] hand
[35:03] the in the other cn our last stage self
[35:06] love and love for material things will
[35:08] take the place of the true love of god
[35:11] we need to guard against the power of
[35:14] sin in these last days so many are
[35:16] getting so hard look what he says here
[35:19] so many are getting so hard because they
[35:22] haven't realized the effect of this last
[35:25] day spirit all right
[35:28] i'll read that again so many are getting
[35:31] so hard because they haven't realized
[35:34] the effect
[35:35] of this last day spirit
[35:40] and he says it is time to draw nigh to
[35:44] god
[35:44] and let him fill our lives with his love
[35:49] amen or we will or we will feel the
[35:52] coldness of the last day church
[35:55] and watch and reject the truth of god
[35:57] which alone is able to help us
[36:01] amen how do you think somebody that
[36:03] leaves the the word of god who who who
[36:06] decides i don't want to serve god
[36:07] anymore or who stop or or or leaves the
[36:10] message amen how does it start
[36:14] somewhere or another they leave the word
[36:15] of god
[36:17] some they start getting cold on god
[36:21] and eventually
[36:22] they will produce and you will see them
[36:24] i mean you just look go through their
[36:26] facebook posts they started out like
[36:28] this and then they end up this way
[36:31] it's a totally different thing
[36:34] wise because they let down their guard
[36:36] somewhere
[36:37] amen
[36:38] they let down the garden they felt that
[36:40] coldness of the last day church they
[36:42] rejected the truth somewhere or another
[36:45] amen
[36:46] you see in order for you to to uh
[36:50] in order for you to go and do your own
[36:52] thing and i'm speaking to everybody here
[36:54] but in order for you to go and do your
[36:56] own thing you have to overstep the word
[36:59] of god somewhere or another that's right
[37:01] you see yeah i i i if i if i if i'm
[37:05] gonna let's just say this is the word of
[37:07] god you know if i need to get to brother
[37:09] wade amen that's my idea i need to get
[37:12] to brother wade i've got to get around
[37:14] this this word somewhere or another to
[37:16] get to him right amen you see right and
[37:18] that's what people are doing in this
[37:20] hour that's right amen they're just
[37:21] overstepping the boundaries of the word
[37:23] they're overstepping what god has
[37:25] already laid out for them so that they
[37:27] could be happy so that they could have
[37:28] joy in their life so that they could
[37:30] have the peace of god so that they can
[37:31] live
[37:32] peaceably with man
[37:35] in order to fulfill their own lust their
[37:37] own desires
[37:38] and then they realize amen what am i
[37:40] doing here
[37:44] and you just have to look at their
[37:45] facebook posts and you realize what's
[37:47] going on
[37:49] people just tell on themselves
[37:52] just look at facebook well then maybe
[37:54] you shouldn't because then you'll be
[37:56] there doing this yeah
[37:59] and then you realize what am i doing
[38:03] has that ever happened to me
[38:04] [Laughter]
[38:06] or it just happens to me
[38:09] yeah but yeah yeah i mean you're there
[38:11] looking at people with what they ate for
[38:13] breakfast and all that stuff what do i
[38:14] care yeah
[38:16] all right
[38:18] so it's very this last day spirit is
[38:21] very very very
[38:23] very easy to get into
[38:25] there is nothing wrong with you
[38:28] having the business doing what you need
[38:30] to do working you've got to you've got
[38:32] to do what you got to do go to school
[38:34] have friends
[38:36] uh have a hobby do all those things and
[38:38] i'm talking to our young people amen do
[38:40] what you got to do but don't let those
[38:43] things ever take
[38:45] take over the word of god in your life
[38:48] don't ever let that take over the word
[38:50] of god or the holy spirit in your heart
[38:52] amen
[38:54] because this thing's about to end saints
[38:58] that's is this thing's about to finish
[39:00] up and we're just seeing the last few
[39:02] things last few
[39:04] things of it in this hour so
[39:06] we talked about last time in regards to
[39:08] how close judas
[39:10] judas was with the disciples
[39:12] that that jesus said the one that that
[39:16] that soaks the sop or the piece of bread
[39:19] you know he'd be the one and judas did
[39:21] it
[39:23] and the disciples still didn't realize
[39:25] that that was him
[39:28] you see
[39:29] and and we've lived in this hour in the
[39:31] last several years we've lived and we've
[39:34] seen amen the the how people have left
[39:37] this word
[39:38] and we thought we would never see them
[39:41] leave this world but we have a so close
[39:42] we would go to their meetings we'd we'd
[39:44] jump and shout sing with them and
[39:46] everything even eat with them and
[39:49] fellowship with them have them ask us
[39:51] questions and you talk with them and
[39:53] and all of a sudden hmm
[39:58] it's hard for us to see they're so close
[40:00] to each other it's like the tear the
[40:02] tear and the and the wheat they look
[40:04] alike
[40:06] amen they look alike but there are
[40:08] there's differences there
[40:10] amen there's differences amen the holy
[40:12] spirit will be able to spot those
[40:14] differences but if you don't have the
[40:15] holy spirit amen you'll just go right on
[40:18] with it
[40:19] amen you'll go right on with that
[40:22] because of the popularity because of of
[40:24] the of the status of the person
[40:27] and then you'll be you'll be you'll be
[40:29] uh
[40:31] uh you'll be deceived right
[40:33] just like just like the persons
[40:35] amen
[40:37] so
[40:38] so now let's look at ju
[40:40] john chapter 13.
[40:42] that was just a short and you can go
[40:44] back and listen to the last two services
[40:46] on this
[40:47] you get to get more details but if we
[40:49] look at john chapter 13
[40:51] and uh we we stopped at verse 20
[40:54] verse 30 i believe it was
[40:57] and uh
[40:59] where he says where judah says he then
[41:02] uh where judah where it says he then
[41:04] having received the sop went immediately
[41:06] out
[41:07] and it was night
[41:08] amen
[41:10] so
[41:11] when jesus pointed it out amen judas
[41:14] didn't like it
[41:16] and he stepped out
[41:18] and that's what they do
[41:20] amen when you point the with the truth
[41:22] and the word to people amen and they
[41:24] don't like it you realize amen their
[41:26] shift their their face changed and their
[41:28] attitude changes and their amen that
[41:31] that's that's one key thing and judas
[41:33] did what he was going to do
[41:35] and the bible says that it was night
[41:36] amen it was it's in this evening time
[41:39] amen they were seeing this
[41:40] and this late hour that we're living in
[41:42] is where we're seeing
[41:44] all these people amen that are just
[41:46] leaving the word amen
[41:48] and just uh
[41:49] you know
[41:50] they have found something better
[41:52] amen i don't know what's better than the
[41:54] word
[41:56] when than the revealed word i just i
[41:59] don't know what's better than that amen
[42:02] verse 31 now
[42:04] jesus wanted him to go
[42:07] amen
[42:08] i mean he was going to do that anyways
[42:10] he's the son of perdition but now we're
[42:13] getting ready to see here what
[42:14] what jesus is about to to to show them
[42:18] amen after judas steps out because he
[42:20] needed to step out in order for him to
[42:22] be able to speak more clearly to his
[42:24] disciples amen and in verse 31 he says
[42:27] therefore when he was gone out now see
[42:29] the bible makes it a point to even say
[42:31] that
[42:32] when therefore when he judas was gone
[42:34] out jesus said
[42:36] now
[42:37] now is the son of man glorified and god
[42:41] is glorified in him
[42:43] amen
[42:44] amen
[42:46] it's interesting that jesus says that
[42:48] right there because even in in him
[42:51] knowing what was getting ready to happen
[42:53] to him he was already
[42:55] making the situation as as if uh uh
[42:59] he wasn't uh he wasn't being stressed
[43:01] out by the situation you see he was
[43:03] looking at the situation as like this is
[43:05] an opportunity for the word of god to
[43:08] continue to be fulfilled i'm getting
[43:10] ready to be glorified i'm getting ready
[43:12] to fulfill everything that that that i
[43:15] was sent here to to fulfill amen praise
[43:18] god
[43:19] it almost reminds me of when on like on
[43:22] the day of pentecost amen what peter uh
[43:25] said this is that
[43:27] amen
[43:28] this is that that was spoken of amen so
[43:31] it's like jesus amen he said now
[43:33] amen now is
[43:35] or or or like when when if you remember
[43:38] the
[43:38] the vision that brother branham had when
[43:40] uh he went to go heal that that one girl
[43:44] and everything had to be in in in in in
[43:47] order there were there needed to be a
[43:49] lady sitting on that chair and cleaning
[43:51] her glasses this needed to be in place
[43:53] this needed to be in place amen that's
[43:55] the exact same thing that needed to be
[43:57] right here and this in this scene that
[43:59] we're looking at amen judas needed to
[44:01] leave so that now amen
[44:04] now is the son of man glorified and god
[44:06] is glorified in him verse 32 if god be
[44:10] glorified in him
[44:11] god shall also glorify him
[44:15] in himself
[44:17] and shall straightway glorify him amen
[44:20] are you glorified amen
[44:22] amen he's justified he has now glorified
[44:25] amen the bible says praise god are you
[44:27] is it just a separate glorification amen
[44:31] is the same glory if you got his holy
[44:33] spirit amen you're glorified in heavenly
[44:36] place you're sitting in heavenly places
[44:38] in christ jesus tonight
[44:42] it's hard to believe
[44:43] oh man i'm tired
[44:45] been driving that chicken truck all day
[44:47] long
[44:47] [Laughter]
[44:49] well ryan maybe he's got to drive it
[44:50] tonight
[44:52] oh man i've been hey man it doesn't seem
[44:54] like we're we're glorified amen but we
[44:57] are because the bible says so
[44:59] amen we don't feel it on the outside but
[45:01] the bible says that we are now in
[45:04] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[45:06] jesus now
[45:08] see now because jesus said there in
[45:10] verse 31 now is the son of man glorified
[45:14] and in reality it really what it hadn't
[45:17] not really taken place yet because it
[45:20] needed he needed to still die he needed
[45:22] to resurrect but he was already talking
[45:24] about the now
[45:25] and so we need to look at ourselves now
[45:27] even though we see this chaos even if we
[45:30] see the judas's leaving the message even
[45:32] if we see everything going on now are we
[45:34] sitting in heavenly places
[45:38] you are now special people
[45:41] not that you will be
[45:43] not that you were amen you are now i
[45:46] like brother dale brother dale loves the
[45:48] present
[45:49] the present god the now god
[45:52] amen we serve the now god amen
[45:55] praise the lord jesus
[45:57] it's good to serve the god of the future
[45:59] yeah we know that there's promises in
[46:02] the word for the future
[46:03] amen but that's for the future amen amen
[46:05] it was good to see the promises that god
[46:07] fulfilled in the past but that was the
[46:09] past i want to know what god's doing now
[46:13] what is god doing now in your life amen
[46:17] verse 32 if god be glorified in him god
[46:19] shall also glorify him in himself and
[46:23] shall straightway glorify him this is
[46:25] jesus
[46:26] still speaking verse 33 he says little
[46:28] children yet a little while i am with
[46:31] you so he's telling him i'm going to be
[46:32] with you for just a little bit more
[46:35] and you shall seek me you're going to
[46:37] you're going to seek me
[46:39] and as i said unto the jews whether i go
[46:42] where i go you cannot come
[46:44] but watch he says here so now i say to
[46:47] you
[46:49] so now i say to you
[46:51] he couldn't say this while judas was
[46:53] still there
[46:54] there's certain things that god is doing
[46:56] now in our lives and this word is just
[46:58] opening up more and more to us amen but
[47:00] you know what some of the things that
[47:01] have happened in the last several years
[47:03] have had to happen
[47:05] in order for us to come to the place
[47:07] where we are now
[47:08] i believe that amen and and and don't be
[47:12] surprised that there's more surprises
[47:16] i hope not
[47:18] but you stay with the word
[47:20] you stay where you need to with what you
[47:23] have believed amen don't worry about who
[47:25] who who else isn't believing or who
[47:28] seems like they're they're doubting amen
[47:30] you worry about yourself
[47:32] where if you're doubting the word
[47:34] am i doubting the word amen
[47:38] i go you cannot come so now i say to you
[47:40] watch what he says here in verse 34 a
[47:43] new commandment i give unto you
[47:46] a new commandment
[47:50] see because we talked about they had
[47:52] their commandments
[47:54] but uh
[47:56] at the
[47:56] even in their own commandments the first
[47:59] two commandments pointed to loving god
[48:02] amen and to love thy neighbor as thyself
[48:05] amen
[48:06] in other words pointing them back to
[48:07] love
[48:08] amen
[48:09] a new commandment i give unto you that
[48:11] ye love one another as i have loved you
[48:15] that ye also love one another now watch
[48:19] in verse 35 he says by this
[48:22] by what by loving one another
[48:26] by this shall all men know that you are
[48:29] my disciples
[48:32] if
[48:33] you have love one to another amen now
[48:36] the love the the word love here that
[48:38] that we're talking about is the word
[48:40] agape this is when you look back at this
[48:42] word it's the word agape amen
[48:46] now how are we going to demonstrate to
[48:47] the world that we love one another
[48:50] i i mean that we are his disciples
[48:53] by loving one another right now you may
[48:55] ask the question how do i love my
[48:57] brother
[48:58] how can i love my brother how can i love
[49:00] my sister
[49:02] amen because it's it's usually the ones
[49:04] of the same family that get on each
[49:06] other's nerves most of the time
[49:10] amen
[49:11] some of us who see each other more and
[49:13] more often is ones that we get on each
[49:16] other's nerves more and more often if
[49:18] we're not careful if we allow it
[49:20] amen
[49:21] but we're supposed to amen those things
[49:23] happen
[49:25] to help mature us
[49:27] amen in the love of christ praise the
[49:30] lord jesus
[49:31] amen so how do i love my brother amen
[49:34] we're going to turn here in just a
[49:35] moment to romans chapter 12 amen we're
[49:38] going to read a few verses there but
[49:39] here are some things amen how do i love
[49:42] my brother i mean one of the things that
[49:44] you love your brother is be willing to
[49:46] forgive
[49:49] be willing to forgive
[49:52] amen
[49:53] that is
[49:55] something very easy to say but it's so
[49:57] hard to do
[49:59] be willing to forgive amen and and not
[50:02] just loving your brother because it's
[50:04] easy to love those that love you back
[50:09] amen amen amen because if you can love
[50:13] your brother amen if you practice
[50:15] loving for your brother amen then then
[50:17] it's it's not a problem amen you loving
[50:20] anybody else amen
[50:21] praise god
[50:24] it's being able to get
[50:26] along with those in the same family amen
[50:28] that that sometimes is the toughest amen
[50:31] because we just know each other so good
[50:33] and we just rub shoulders all the time
[50:35] amen we just don't amen
[50:37] that's when we need to make sure that we
[50:39] love because sometimes that gives us a
[50:42] it gives us an easy avenue amen to just
[50:45] say whatever comes to mind
[50:48] and disrespect one another
[50:50] and say things amen to each other and
[50:53] and about others amen that just is
[50:55] disrespectful and it in in it it hurts
[50:58] the body of christ and whole right
[51:00] amen i'm just being true i'm just being
[51:02] honest i'm just telling you that that's
[51:04] how it is but be willing to forgive amen
[51:07] and how many times did jesus say to
[51:09] forgive
[51:11] eight times
[51:14] ten times
[51:16] seven times
[51:18] no he said seventy times seven
[51:22] but that is not whatever 70 times 7 is
[51:25] by the way
[51:26] 490
[51:28] yes
[51:29] for one thing that's not just 490 times
[51:33] and that's it
[51:34] oh you're at your 489th time you better
[51:36] not do it again i'm not going to forgive
[51:38] you after the 490th time that's not what
[51:41] jesus was talking about
[51:43] he was talking about unlimited
[51:45] forgiveness
[51:47] because why you want god to unlimitedly
[51:49] forgive you too
[51:51] so why can't you do that for your
[51:53] brother or your sister
[51:55] we always go to god lord jesus what is
[51:57] the first thing that we should at least
[51:59] be praying for is lord forgive me if
[52:02] there's anything i've done forgive us
[52:04] forgive me amen amen
[52:07] paul had to repent even for things and
[52:09] and the type of man that he was and the
[52:12] life that he lived he still repented
[52:14] brother branham the type of man that he
[52:16] was and the life that he lived he still
[52:17] repented we all have to repent so if we
[52:20] want god to forgive us amen we must also
[52:22] be willing to forgive
[52:24] every moment every time every single
[52:27] moment it happens and be patient with
[52:29] one another
[52:31] and loving to one another amen so be
[52:33] willing to forgive that's one way to
[52:35] show love to your brother
[52:37] because let me tell you your brother and
[52:39] your sister will fail you
[52:42] if they haven't already
[52:44] they will fail you that's just how it is
[52:46] amen they will fail you but can you
[52:48] forgive them
[52:49] lift them back up
[52:51] lift them back up with forgiveness
[52:54] sacrifice yourself for your brother or
[52:55] your sister amen
[52:58] amen are you willing to lay down your
[53:00] life for them
[53:01] jesus said you are my friends in john 15
[53:04] we just read here
[53:05] you are my friends and friends will be
[53:08] willing to lay down their life for one
[53:09] another
[53:14] let's just sink that in for a moment
[53:18] are we willing to do that hey listen and
[53:20] when i'm i'm i'm talking to myself as
[53:22] well
[53:23] all right can you give your life and
[53:25] that's that's that's not just saying hey
[53:28] man somebody comes in here and shoots
[53:30] amen and i take a bullet for brother
[53:32] wade
[53:33] yeah
[53:36] because that's the that's the thought
[53:37] that at least it comes to my head you
[53:39] know
[53:42] [Laughter]
[53:45] take two
[53:47] but it's not just that
[53:49] but if
[53:50] if if you can't even sacrifice even a
[53:53] little thing amen sacrifice some time
[53:56] for your brother or your sister how are
[53:58] you going to take a bullet for your
[53:59] brother or your sister
[54:01] if you can't sacrifice some time for
[54:03] them
[54:05] if you can't if you if you if you can't
[54:08] if you're not willing to listen to them
[54:12] how are you going to be able to take a
[54:14] bullet for your brother or your sister
[54:17] think about that
[54:19] so that is one way to love your brother
[54:22] are you willing to sacrifice yourself or
[54:24] your brother lay down your life
[54:27] for your brother your sister
[54:29] another way is to how is is have
[54:32] unselfish compassion for your brother or
[54:35] your sister amen
[54:37] praise god amen we we see where cain he
[54:40] lost his compassion for his brother
[54:43] abel
[54:44] and you know why he lost his compassion
[54:46] his love for his brother because his his
[54:48] brother's works were were better than
[54:50] his
[54:52] and guess what happened instead of him
[54:54] seeing where can i where did i make a
[54:57] instead of him going to abel abel uh
[54:59] where is it that i'm missing it you know
[55:01] what you know humbling himself you know
[55:04] he takes a stone and kills him
[55:10] hurts his brother
[55:12] and what is what does that show it shows
[55:14] his jealousy
[55:16] it was jealousy that caused that drove
[55:18] cain to do what he did to kill his
[55:20] brother so
[55:21] have unselfish compassion for one
[55:23] another amen amen amen again everything
[55:26] that i'm saying amen
[55:28] i'm saying it from the pulpit down to
[55:30] the
[55:31] to the to the end of the
[55:33] hallway there amen
[55:35] another thing is is to have an attitude
[55:38] of sharing amen
[55:40] be willing to share praise god
[55:42] be willing to give up what you prize
[55:44] most
[55:46] amen now i mean if you if i if you're if
[55:51] the bible says to give up your life for
[55:53] your brother that's we prize our life
[55:55] right
[55:56] so
[55:57] anything else that you can are willing
[55:59] to give up for your for your brother
[56:01] amen
[56:03] not just give it to them because you
[56:05] don't want it anyways
[56:07] like they're a good will or something
[56:11] isn't that what we do when we go to
[56:12] goodwill oh we feel so good because
[56:14] we're donating some clothes we're
[56:15] donating some some some toys or whatever
[56:18] but we don't want them anyways
[56:22] are you willing to
[56:24] share
[56:25] with those the even the most important
[56:27] things in your life
[56:32] amen
[56:33] including your time
[56:36] amen and another thing here is keeping
[56:38] unity with each other
[56:40] and amongst each other amen
[56:43] keeping the unity that's that's
[56:46] that's so important amen
[56:48] keeping unity
[56:50] don't let anything amen break that unity
[56:54] between each other
[56:55] because it breaks
[56:57] it'll break the your affection and the
[56:59] love that you have for your brother
[57:01] amen romans chapter 12 romans chapter
[57:04] 12.
[57:12] you love the lord
[57:13] amen
[57:15] romans chapter 12 we'll just read a few
[57:16] verses here
[57:18] and maybe say a couple of things here
[57:20] this is paul speaking here he says let
[57:23] love be without the simulation
[57:26] verse 9
[57:27] let love be without the simulation now
[57:29] what is the simulation the simulation is
[57:32] hypocrisy
[57:33] so in other words let your love be
[57:35] without hypocrisy or let it not be a
[57:38] feigned love
[57:40] amen
[57:41] let your love be real
[57:44] amen abhor that which is evil that means
[57:46] hate that which is evil
[57:48] and cleave to that which is good and
[57:51] then grab on to that which is good
[57:53] number 10
[57:55] be kindly affection one to another with
[57:58] brotherly love
[58:00] now remember we are talking about
[58:02] jesus's commandment
[58:05] right his commandment was to love one
[58:07] another
[58:08] my new commandment amen
[58:10] that's what he was saying
[58:12] be kindly affection one to another with
[58:14] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[58:16] another
[58:17] not slothful in business fervent in
[58:20] spirit serving the lord rejoicing in
[58:22] hope patient and tribulation continuing
[58:26] in
[58:26] instant instant in prayer
[58:29] distributing to the necessity of saints
[58:34] given to hospitality
[58:37] amen
[58:39] are you willing to open your home
[58:41] to be hospitable to to to
[58:45] amen that's that's part of hospitality
[58:48] amen
[58:49] that's where we get the word hospital
[58:52] amen when you go to the hospital you
[58:53] don't get treated at home but you know
[58:55] you're you say you're in the hospital no
[58:58] you're you're somewhere else outside of
[58:59] your home
[59:00] you're in a hospital amen bless them
[59:03] which persecute you
[59:05] bless and curse not now
[59:07] isn't this like the words that jesus was
[59:09] saying when he was given the beatitudes
[59:12] and this is what paul is saying
[59:14] amen and paul has the same spirit that
[59:16] jesus has amen bless them which
[59:18] persecute you persecute you bless
[59:21] and curse not rejoice with them that do
[59:24] rejoice and weep with them that weep
[59:28] be of the same mind one toward another
[59:31] mind not high things but condescend to
[59:34] man of low estate be not wise in your
[59:37] own conceits now i want to read this in
[59:39] the in the
[59:40] the new living
[59:43] testament version i believe that's what
[59:44] it is nlt version look what it says it
[59:47] says live in harmony with each other
[59:49] don't be too proud to enjoy the company
[59:52] of ordinary people
[59:54] and don't think you know it all
[59:58] that's what paul was saying
[1:00:01] in plain language
[1:00:04] and don't think you know it all
[1:00:06] lord help me amen
[1:00:08] amen
[1:00:10] lord help me
[1:00:13] because you see
[1:00:14] cain would have reacted differently to
[1:00:16] abel
[1:00:17] you see
[1:00:19] but because he didn't want to
[1:00:20] acknowledge amen that abel did something
[1:00:23] better than him
[1:00:26] which is fine
[1:00:28] amen but how can i learn from my brother
[1:00:30] or my sister
[1:00:31] instead of me hating them amen
[1:00:34] and and
[1:00:35] any bad word that you could say about
[1:00:37] your brother or your sister amen that's
[1:00:39] just like throwing a stone at them
[1:00:43] it's killing their influence
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] praise god
[1:00:48] so
[1:00:49] don't be too proud to enjoy the company
[1:00:50] of ordinary people and don't think you
[1:00:53] know it all
[1:00:54] amen because let me tell you
[1:00:56] i want to throw in this little story
[1:00:59] when
[1:01:00] back home in in south carolina where i
[1:01:02] grew up i grew up in greenville south
[1:01:04] carolina and in in the streets there
[1:01:07] roamed this lady
[1:01:08] she would walk back for years this lady
[1:01:11] who
[1:01:12] who her her nickname was hubba hubba
[1:01:17] that was her nickname
[1:01:18] and she she looked dirty she had a beard
[1:01:23] uh she would i mean she just didn't look
[1:01:25] like she smelled
[1:01:27] she and she would just walk all over the
[1:01:29] streets of berea
[1:01:31] near traveler's rest
[1:01:34] all over the streets everybody knew who
[1:01:36] hubba hubba was
[1:01:37] and people would and kids and and and
[1:01:40] teenagers and even adults would go by

[1:03:21] because people wouldn't do that to her
[1:03:24] partly people would always just be mean
[1:03:26] to her but then when she's when she saw
[1:03:28] that somebody was literally legitimate

[1:04:59] verse where paul says amen don't be too
[1:05:02] proud to enjoy the company of ordinary
[1:05:04] people

[1:05:12] even the the most
[1:05:14] quietest person in the in the church
[1:05:17] and you can learn from somebody
[1:05:19] take every moment and every opportunity
[1:05:22] and not just to thank young people not
[1:05:24] just to think i'm just going to hang out
[1:05:26] with the with the with the with the
[1:05:27] popular group i'm just going to hang out

[1:05:38] seeing somebody sitting in a corner amen
[1:05:40] and not being it not having fellowship
[1:05:42] that's just that's never been me you
[1:05:44] know i at least want to go say something
[1:05:46] to him you know
[1:05:48] so just if you we take time to do that
[1:05:50] amen that'll just help us and it'll help
[1:05:52] that person too
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:55] jesus humility amen that we read about
[1:05:57] there in john 13 i mean he the god of
[1:06:00] heaven and earth he humbled himself
[1:06:02] to wash amen the disciples dirty feet
[1:06:06] amen
[1:06:07] and that is our example praise god
[1:06:09] let's continue reading in verse 17.
[1:06:11] we're almost done here recompense to no
[1:06:13] man evil for evil
[1:06:16] in other words don't pay back don't
[1:06:18] don't get even with people
[1:06:20] i mean somebody does something to you
[1:06:22] don't try to get even with them
[1:06:24] because
[1:06:25] that's not that's not god's spirit
[1:06:27] that's not christ spirit recompense to
[1:06:29] no man evil for evil provide things
[1:06:33] honest in the sight of all man
[1:06:36] and watch verse 18 if it be possible
[1:06:39] as much as lieth in you
[1:06:42] live peaceably with all man
[1:06:46] i know that's that's what paul says here
[1:06:48] if it be possible because sometimes
[1:06:50] that's not possible
[1:06:52] but don't let it come from you
[1:06:54] [Laughter]
[1:06:56] sometimes you know you just can't you
[1:06:58] can't deal with people so the best thing
[1:07:00] to do is just stay quiet
[1:07:02] just just leave them alone
[1:07:05] some people just don't budge you know
[1:07:08] you've done your part let god do the
[1:07:10] rest
[1:07:12] maybe i'm wrong in thinking that way but
[1:07:14] if you've just tried and tried and tried
[1:07:16] and tried to deal with people at some
[1:07:18] point i mean god doesn't stops dealing
[1:07:20] with us at some point
[1:07:22] you see right
[1:07:24] if we keep rejecting him at some point
[1:07:27] he won't deal with you anymore the bible
[1:07:29] says that he won't strive with man
[1:07:30] forever
[1:07:32] amen praise god
[1:07:35] but but by if possible live peaceably
[1:07:38] with all men
[1:07:39] verse 19 dearly beloved avenge not
[1:07:42] yourselves don't try to get you know
[1:07:45] get even yourself but rather give place
[1:07:48] unto wrath in other words don't don't
[1:07:50] don't get angry don't let wrath take
[1:07:52] over you amen
[1:07:54] for it is written vengeance is mine i
[1:07:56] will repay seth the lord
[1:07:59] amen somebody did something to you in
[1:08:01] life somebody didn't amen just forget
[1:08:04] about it
[1:08:06] let god take care of it
[1:08:09] if it's not taking care of this life it
[1:08:10] will be taking care of the other
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:14] therefore verse 20 therefore if thine
[1:08:17] enemy hunger feed him this is the
[1:08:18] opposite opposite thinking of what we
[1:08:21] should we think in in our in our you
[1:08:24] know in this life
[1:08:26] if your enemy hungers feed him
[1:08:29] in other words those that persecute you
[1:08:31] the most
[1:08:33] do good to them
[1:08:34] do the opposite amen
[1:08:36] do the opposite no matter who it is
[1:08:40] feed him if he thirsts give him to drink
[1:08:44] for in so doing watch what happens when
[1:08:46] you do this for in so doing thou shall
[1:08:48] heap coals of fire on his head in other
[1:08:51] words what you're going to do is you're
[1:08:53] going to put them to shame by your good
[1:08:54] behavior
[1:08:57] i know we've all heard these things but
[1:08:58] i love i love just looking at the verses
[1:09:01] and just
[1:09:02] and looking at them amen
[1:09:05] you put to shame the people
[1:09:07] that try to do evil to you amen
[1:09:10] by you doing good to them
[1:09:13] but you you you let them see oh my
[1:09:16] goodness what am i doing you put them to
[1:09:18] shame
[1:09:20] praise god you know one a good example
[1:09:22] is david the way he treated king saul
[1:09:25] and saul being his enemy
[1:09:28] well at least he was he he hated david
[1:09:31] because he had a demon but yet david
[1:09:34] never disrespected
[1:09:36] saul
[1:09:37] had the opportunity several times to
[1:09:39] even kill him
[1:09:42] and never did
[1:09:44] he said i cannot lay my hands on the
[1:09:46] lord's anointing
[1:09:49] and david did not have the holy ghost
[1:09:53] how much more
[1:09:55] us with the holy ghost how should we act
[1:09:58] amen praise the lord
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:02] in verse 21 last verse here be not
[1:10:04] overcome of evil
[1:10:06] but overcome evil
[1:10:09] with
[1:10:11] with bad
[1:10:16] overcome evil with good amen
[1:10:19] saints i know that each and every one of
[1:10:21] us
[1:10:22] we're humans and we want to see justice
[1:10:24] i mean i'd love to see some justice
[1:10:26] especially in the day that we're living
[1:10:28] in
[1:10:29] oh my goodness
[1:10:31] you watched somebody committed a
[1:10:33] horrible crime killed somebody or
[1:10:35] whatever and you you want to see some
[1:10:36] justice right
[1:10:38] but but but then if you step back and
[1:10:41] you look and you try to look through the
[1:10:42] eyes of god amen you realize that person
[1:10:45] also has a soul
[1:10:48] no matter what horrible thing that
[1:10:49] they're they're they're engaged in or
[1:10:51] what they did amen
[1:10:53] you could be the opportunity you could
[1:10:56] be that avenue amen for that person to
[1:10:58] even come to christ
[1:11:00] we hear we hear many testimonies like
[1:11:02] that
[1:11:03] amen where where somebody chose
[1:11:06] because maybe they murdered their son
[1:11:08] murdered their daughter but but but they
[1:11:10] chose to not be hateful not to be
[1:11:13] spiteful not to be vengeful and because
[1:11:15] of that attitude amen they win people
[1:11:17] those criminals for christ
[1:11:20] amen
[1:11:22] that's powerful
[1:11:23] praise the lord jesus amen i want to
[1:11:24] just finish with this look what brother
[1:11:26] branham says here in christ the mystery
[1:11:28] of god revealed we all
[1:11:30] have we all know this this quote
[1:11:33] and i don't i don't know if i'll read it
[1:11:34] all but we'll see how it goes but it's
[1:11:37] pretty lengthy
[1:11:38] amen christ the mystery god revealed
[1:11:40] look what brother brown says here
[1:11:42] love one another
[1:11:44] above everything
[1:11:46] love one another
[1:11:49] above everything don't
[1:11:51] no matter what the devil tries to say
[1:11:54] now you're all one great big sweet group
[1:11:56] now he was talking to the tabernacle
[1:11:58] there but remember my warning see
[1:12:00] satan won't let that stay that way
[1:12:04] no sir he'll shoot everything if he has
[1:12:06] to bring somebody in to make his target
[1:12:09] he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in
[1:12:11] and sit him down and cause him to
[1:12:14] fellowship with you under the quietness
[1:12:16] and things and then he'll shoot that guy
[1:12:18] with some kind of a poison poison stuff
[1:12:21] and he'll start through the church with
[1:12:23] it
[1:12:24] amen don't don't you take sides with it
[1:12:27] brother branham says
[1:12:29] don't you have nothing to do with
[1:12:31] anything else
[1:12:32] he says you stay right loving and sweet
[1:12:35] and kind to one another
[1:12:37] pray for that man that he'll be saved to
[1:12:40] or that woman or ever who it is just
[1:12:44] pray for them and watch and stick one
[1:12:46] with another
[1:12:48] and stay with your pastor
[1:12:51] see he's the shepherd and you give him
[1:12:53] respects
[1:12:55] he'll lead you through and call and
[1:12:57] cause he's ordained of god to do so
[1:13:01] amen
[1:13:03] now do you remember that congregation
[1:13:05] says amen the enemy will come
[1:13:08] and when he does
[1:13:10] just cling that much closer together
[1:13:13] all right
[1:13:14] and i know here is the church you all
[1:13:16] have seen the enemy coming
[1:13:18] all the time amen
[1:13:20] best thing to do is just cling closer to
[1:13:22] one another amen
[1:13:24] that's part of fulfilling the law of
[1:13:26] christ
[1:13:27] amen and the one that the devil is using
[1:13:29] for an enemy will either get out or come
[1:13:31] in and be one of you that's all
[1:13:36] don't ever clan among one or talk make
[1:13:39] yours or make yourself clannish
[1:13:41] amen we are one
[1:13:44] i couldn't say left hand i'm i'm mad at
[1:13:47] you i'm going to take you away because
[1:13:48] you're not a right hand he's my left
[1:13:50] hand i want him to stay there
[1:13:53] even the little tip of my finger i want
[1:13:55] to stay right there every little part of
[1:13:57] my body stay right there you don't want
[1:14:00] any part of your body to be gone
[1:14:03] no matter if it's malfunctioning
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:06] bella she's been having some problem
[1:14:08] with one of her eyes since yesterday but
[1:14:11] i'm sure she doesn't want
[1:14:13] her eye to be plucked out
[1:14:17] let's give that as an example
[1:14:19] you see we want to try to stay together
[1:14:21] you wanted to keep it intact right bella
[1:14:23] you want your eye to still stay and you
[1:14:25] just want it to be to get better
[1:14:30] all right even the little tip of my
[1:14:31] finger i want to stay right there every
[1:14:33] little part of my body stay right there
[1:14:34] and god wants us as a body of believers
[1:14:36] to stay right exactly with one another
[1:14:40] right
[1:14:41] right at with one another and now you've
[1:14:43] got tapes on that you've got tapes on
[1:14:45] what we believe you've got tapes on
[1:14:46] discipline in the church how we behave
[1:14:48] ourself in the church of god how we
[1:14:51] got to come here together and sit
[1:14:52] together in heavenly places
[1:14:54] don't stay home
[1:14:59] don't stay home if god is in your heart
[1:15:02] you can't hardly wait for them doors to
[1:15:04] open out yonder to get in here to
[1:15:06] fellowship with your brothers
[1:15:10] that's part of the love of christ if you
[1:15:12] don't if you don't feel that way then i
[1:15:15] tell you it's time you got to go praying
[1:15:18] because
[1:15:19] watch what he says because we're in the
[1:15:21] last days
[1:15:23] do you believe we're in the last days
[1:15:24] brother branham was saying that in 1963
[1:15:27] i believe this was
[1:15:28] how much more now
[1:15:31] because we're in the last days where the
[1:15:32] bible exhorted us to much more as we see
[1:15:35] that day approaching to love one another
[1:15:39] with christian love and divine love
[1:15:42] to assemble ourselves together in
[1:15:45] heavenly places and in christ jesus and
[1:15:48] love one another
[1:15:49] this will all men know you are my
[1:15:51] disciples when you have love
[1:15:53] one for the other that's right and he
[1:15:55] says again stay right together
[1:15:58] if the brother
[1:15:59] oh my goodness
[1:16:01] let me read right here if the brother
[1:16:02] you think
[1:16:03] he's a little wrong or the sister say
[1:16:06] lord don't let me never have the root of
[1:16:08] bitterness spring up
[1:16:10] because it'll it'll affect him and it'll
[1:16:13] take the christ right out of my life
[1:16:17] you think somebody's a little wrong amen
[1:16:18] just pray for him
[1:16:20] amen but don't ever let root of
[1:16:22] bitterness say man get into your heart
[1:16:25] because eventually that will show
[1:16:27] it will grow into a tree amen
[1:16:31] and it'll take the christ right out of
[1:16:33] my life that poison acids of malice and
[1:16:36] jealousy and hatred that will just take
[1:16:38] the holy spirit right away from you
[1:16:41] it will run him from the tabernacle here
[1:16:44] it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it
[1:16:46] away from here or hurt your pastor
[1:16:48] it'll do everything
[1:16:50] just that little root of bitterness
[1:16:53] so any little root of bitterness that we
[1:16:55] may have against somebody just get it
[1:16:56] right
[1:16:57] make it right just talk about it
[1:17:00] talk mate just just just talk about it
[1:17:03] amen
[1:17:05] hurt your pastor it'll do everything you
[1:17:07] just wax that much closer together
[1:17:10] draw up
[1:17:11] the take the buckle as the brother
[1:17:12] testified a minister here the other
[1:17:14] night about having a buckle seeing it in
[1:17:17] a vision
[1:17:18] just that buckles on the whole armor of
[1:17:20] god just pull her on tighten up
[1:17:23] move right up close to one another
[1:17:26] love one another anyhow
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:30] talk nice about one another
[1:17:35] say nice things about one another
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:40] and then god will bless you
[1:17:45] just pull closer together amen
[1:17:49] when you see satan amen when you when
[1:17:51] with you with the spirit of god in you
[1:17:53] amen what happens when the enemy comes
[1:17:55] in
[1:17:56] you raise up a standard because you got
[1:17:58] the same spirit it's the spirit that
[1:18:00] raises the standard it's the spirit in
[1:18:02] you that raises that standard amen
[1:18:05] but you be the one amen amen
[1:18:07] so
[1:18:08] i know we've all read that quote amen we
[1:18:10] might read it again because it's so good
[1:18:13] as a reminder amen because i i i'd like
[1:18:17] i have one more thing i want to talk
[1:18:19] about this before we finish up this
[1:18:21] little series and we might just read
[1:18:22] this again but it's good to remind
[1:18:24] ourselves
