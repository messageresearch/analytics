the sisters downstairs and june and i have been discussing i think we're going to have soup and and maybe soup and chili and sandwiches so we all need to all get together uh between now and then and figure out what just to get i know pizza's easy but it's also expensive so we'll cut down our cost a little bit by it'll be it'll be cool it'll be cold in january so soup and soup sandwiches sounds

brother tim cross will be here so i've already talked to those two and brother mike said tell y'all hello he's been he's preached about six times you know he had open-heart surgery a few months ago and he's doing a lot better so let's just remember him in prayer there's so much to pray about the list has got so long until um sometimes i just last night i said lord there's a list and i can't remember all of it i said but just remember them people on that list so hey man so let's just remember all those and we all have needs all things are going on in life with all this cover junk you know sister ruth is out she's got you know they announced that so just stay away if you're sick and wear a mask if you want to um i don't think this one's as bad as the other one is but still it's bad it's bad to be sick it's just bad to be sick bad to get old but it's bad to be old and sick that's what i'm getting old and sick so anyway so um all those announcements i know that sometimes you don't hear them all but i have got them online where you can where you can remember them so let's just remember those things coming up pray for the needs of brother louise he sounded really tired the other day when he sent that message to us and he's he's doing seven weeks of work i mean seven straight weeks of nothing but preaching traveling and he's doing a real good job and i believe the lord just gave him some really good fruit for that labor amen and when he gets back the lord will give him a rejuvenation because you know what when he comes back he's got to go back to work then you got to go back to the same old grind that he was in you know before i i know how that is because i went to the philippines for three weeks the first time i went and man it was great but boy when you come back everything piles up because your your life don't stop it just keeps moving and as you when you get home it's just boom dropped on top of you so so let's just remember brother louise so let's go to the lord in prayer we're going to continue on who is this son of man we're going to talk a little bit about the headstone today amen who is the headstone jesus christ head of the church our bridegroom amen so let's bow our head the heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity we have to speak to the greatest people that ever walked in the face of the earth they may be great athletes or great this or great that the lord they'll never be a greater group of people than the bride of jesus christ and lord we pray that you would be with us and bind us together help us to stay together lord and pray over these sicknesses and and bind the devil where he can't work in between us and where he can't get between us and lord will your just lord hold your bride closer and closer now toward the end father we pray that you would just continue to give us revelation we come here today to hear from you lord i was thinking last night father talking to you i know one thing's for sure the prophet said we are better or worse when we leave this service and just to be honest sometimes we're a little worse because we don't get everything that we need but father i pray today that everybody will be better it will get a better revelation a better time in you a better something that'll help us to grow in grace and knowledge and only you can do that lord but we have to have that desire today we've come to church with a desire to hear from you lord now i pray that you speak to the people be with all the ones that are sick lord the ones that are in this uh sanctuary lord that are sick and the ones outside the sanctuary i pray that you should be with them be the ones that are traveling bless our pastor lord and keep him strengthened and keep him strong we pray in jesus name amen this would be part 14. in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was in the world let's go to verse 10. i kind of cut through some of that he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now here's the creator now listen everybody in this building knows who henry ford is right he created the first automobile amen so we know who that is we've got books about his life and but this man that created the world don't know who he is amen we know who this one is and who that one is by history but the world knew him not that's why we have to come out of the world to know him you'll only know him by the holy ghost and that means you've come out of the world to get into him all right he came unto his own and his own received him not so he came to the religious world he came to those people and they kicked him out okay but as many as received him amen see there's your out there's your way back but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace not partial not barely uh full of grace and truth you may be seen in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word let's go to hebrews 10 5 because when we talk about a body a body listen hebrews 10 5 wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice an offering thou wouldest not but a body has there prepared me now let's go to ephesians 5 23 and we'll comment on this just for a few minutes i was thinking about something this morning that we really need to cover for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church so he's bride groom we're bride amen only one he's our husband our old husband had to die or we're living in adultery amen all right so even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body now he didn't need his body saved you need to be saved amen his body needed to be made eternal but it didn't have to be saved from sin because it was sinless amen he was a sinless man came the right way came the way he was supposed to all right so now let's look at this though because go back to the next scripture to hebrews 10 5 but a body has now prepared me actually he had to prepare two bodies now it's the same body but remember there was no bride body on the earth amen because what happened was in the garden of eden there had there was supposed to be listen the bride was supposed to been in the garden of eden his bride not eve us amen the genesis 1 26 was supposed to be developed in the garden of eden where there was there was no fall and we were to be married and we were to live forever and ever and do the things you know that were that we're going to do in the in the future home amen but listen to this he had to literally come down and prepare a body a baby like we just went through all right but he was also preparing a spiritual body because it wasn't the natural body anymore because in the garden of eden the marriage vows eve committed adultery against adam amen so there's no way jesus christ could come through that amen that's why he had to come in human flesh that's why he had to be the son of man because you get saved by the son of man the son of god saves you but you have to go through the son of man to get to him because all the father has given me will come to me amen so we know they're the same person but you got to go through jesus christ to get to god amen so he had a literal body that was created by a creative act of what bob was talking about of germ and and uh egg creative yes nothing we did nothing anybody did nothing even mary did but it was a creative act to bring though a literal body to come through a literal womb because that's where it all got messed up in the beginning we all know that but i'm setting a stage here it was marred in the garden so there's no there's no bride could come with flesh think about this there was no bride could come he he brought eve out of adam she was the same flesh as him that's right amen and then we were to come forth i believe by the spoken word of god amen just like we're spoken word children now but the marriage vows got marred not the vows but the liberal act got marred so that couldn't happen so then there had to be one come behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child four thousand years later here comes the word made flesh but now what was his job it was to prepare himself a body and then prepare that spiritual body that he was going to have which turned into a literal body i think we're kind of literal now and if you're born again you're already the bride of jesus christ you're not going to be listen he hasn't reversed the effects of the fall in this thing yet but that's what we're looking toward that's what we're looking the son of man is now glorified in a glorified body that came marred not by sin but it was marked because it had to come into this world hey you're 50 years old he was 30 and he looked 50. that body was wore out but in the resurrection in the resurrection oh i know why the the mary couldn't recognize him and i know why cleopas and him couldn't recognize him he was a young man their eyes were withholding because he had turned back to a young guy he didn't look like that right there he looked like a young 20 year old man it looked old like they saw him as old but what's the first thing he did though he comes to the earth preaches his first sermon ye must be born again in other words what happened in the garden i've come to reverse that effect i know you're married to another husband we're not gonna get in marriage and divorce but you have to cover it you're married to another husband that husband's gonna die nicodemus that old husband has got to die nicodemus could never get that old husband killed because he kept looking back to the law he kept looking back to the old testament sure he believed jesus was something but i don't think he believed he was almighty god maybe a prophet but he did the best he could with what he had he wasn't supposed to see it so there was a literal body on earth that came on the earth to not get married literal let's talk a literal natural body jesus never got married on the earth he could have but he never got married he could have had a wife brother brown said he was a man amen but see that would have marred the plan he would come he come after a spiritual bride there was no natural bride on the earth that was worthy of this man sorry were you worthy no but when he came he made you remember the song he made me worthy and now by his grace amen he made me worthy he had to give his life and that's what we've been talking about the son of man had to die you can't kill the son of god son god's a creator god and you know enjoyed what chris said was talking about this weekend it kind of just dovetailed right into what we were what we've been talking about and we did not discuss it i'm just not going to discuss stuff stuff i don't mean stuff i'm not going to discuss the stuff i've been preaching because you get each other's spirit and you carry it on i want him to preach what god give him and then let you decide whether it was god or not that did it amen whether the holy ghost was leading him or whether it was just some notes he had wrote down same thing with me today so let's go to colossians 1 verse 15. ephesians 5 says the husband is the head of the wife and that's what we're talking we're going to talk about a little bit about the headstone after we get a little more background here we're going to talk about the headstone to the church but we got to get him here first we got to get him in human flesh here first so he can die so he can send back not the human flesh of jesus but send back the spirit to go into your flesh and make you the wife of jesus christ the bride of jesus christ so colossians 1 says who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature so in other words he came the right way he came the way he was supposed to come for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist what a god but now look verse 18 and he's head of the body the church all these great things that he is creator he come to get a body of believers and take us back to where there's no fall there's the eternal plan of redemption and he is the head of the body the church or the bride who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminences so he was the firstborn listen he was the first one to resurrect and never die again now listen lazarus resurrected there was the bones of elisha somebody was thrown on the bones of elisha and somebody but they died everybody been raised from the dead they went ahead they died even lazarus had to die but this man died and raised again he never had to die again amen we know all the scriptures in that too look for it please the father then in him should all fullness dwell and that's what we're trying trying to get to is where brother brown tells us that you and i are the complete bride of jesus christ and being the complete bride of jesus christ you're the fullness of the godhead bot not in one person but as a collective body body of believers that's why i hate people that are critical about well this one don't have any depth or this one don't have any this one's shallow that's none of your business there's people that have a pinky and that's what they are they're the pinky but you know what they can cut that thing off you have trouble picking stuff up if you shun any of the fivefold ministry you're wrong if that fivefold ministry was sent from god i don't care how shallow he is i don't there's nothing shallow about the word of god there's nothing shallow about a man standing here and giving his heart and if he preaches on god's soul of the world that he gave his only begotten son you should be happy about that amen sometimes we get so revelated we don't have any business saying what we say but that's okay you'll learn one day that you probably don't know much either i don't i don't claim to i claim to come right here and stand and let him do the talking amen so i and i think that's what all preachers do they're supposed to preach some maybe you're not but that's not your business either you don't put them in a pulpit and you can't take them out amen please the father that he and him should all fullness dwell now if all that fullness dwell in that man and he's the head of the church where's that fullness guy land it's got a land in the church but him being the head of it all he had to come and reverse the effect of the fall and give us eternal life so look at number one quote we've read it many times in the masterpiece brother adam said body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of it all now this is the literal body of god this is in the old testament in the old testament they spoke of god coming literally in human flesh right so that's what he had to do if they spoke the word of god and that's what came from the mind of god and that's what they spoke when isaiah said a virgin shall conceive there's no way anybody can stop that that's right it had to happen so god had to come down into human flesh and be on the earth listen folks that's a word of promise from the old testament that was a word of promise that jesus stood on just like brother bible was talking about abraham abraham got a promise he stood on the promise he didn't worry about what somebody else said he didn't worry about his circumstances he stood on the promise of god even though he had all kind of faults and failures we keep dwelling on our faults and failures and we're going to stay here another 30 years hopefully not so look and here comes the head of it all jesus come on the scene so now we know for a fact jesus was the head of the church now then this head piece was put upon it we find in him the entire handiwork of god so now we're going to talk about this afternoon probably not this morning we're going to talk about the statue of a perfect man but we had to have someone that lived it first to its perfection because see paul peter all the all the saints they lived all this but they were not the headstone the bible says the headstone was rejected so it had to be what let's just put it this way it disappeared we know he didn't but it this it just it did disappear from the earth because when the head when the headstone left he went up the total fullness of god the faith of jesus christ the virtue of jesus christ the knowledge of jesus christ the temperance of jesus christ the patience god all those were his character but without that head i'll read you a quote this afternoon just like i read it a few days ago brother brown said the church ages got just enough of the holy ghost to make it through believe on jesus christ thou shalt be saved live a good christian life do what your messenger to your age says and then you're going to be hid away in that sixth dimension but somebody somebody has got to bring that head back because that's what resurrected jesus didn't resurrect without a head the fullness of the god had finally resurrected and then he sent it back into the church but what did they reject i'm sorry they rejected jesus in human flesh sorry because the son of god is how you get born again that's not jesus in human flesh it's through jesus in human flesh that you get born again everybody understand that without him i am the way the truth and the life but you only stood one day and he said there's no man good but god now he's standing there the perfect image of god in other words he was saying hey oh easy who you calling perfect that's what the pharisees were talking he said who you calling perfect he said there's only one we know where he was at but still you look at jesus he had he didn't have faults and failures but the bible said he learned by the things that he suffered we'll talk about that in just a second or maybe this afternoon i don't know whether i got my notes in here or not so there had to be a beginning of this creation the headstone had to stay where it was at son of man sent back to on pentecost he set back the baptism of the holy ghost to start his body now start his head he is the head but he came to start his body everybody got that come to start the body but now the body by itself can't take a resurrection it takes the body with the head to take come to the resurrection everybody got that then then why didn't they have take a rapture in the first church age second church chain third fourth fifth even in the sabbath that we call laodicea he's never thought about that though he did start the body the body of god started on the day of pentecost but never was the son of man understood anymore until now now peter and paul and james and all those different ones they had great signs and wonders right that's right and that's what we were supposed to be called back to by this prophet of malachi 4 to be called back to the faith of the fathers all right which is right here down we still got that to deal with because we're going to read here tomorrow or tonight where brother brown says we're not complete without him the church is not complete until that headstone comes down and unites with the body now listen we're not and don't get me wrong we're not a bunch of mindless people paul said we have the mind of christ but we're talking about god back in human flesh again just like you walked on the shores of galilee i read you a quote tonight where brother brown said he said a ministry just like what walked on the earth just like what walked on the earth it's what's going to take us out of here not one word off was jesus one word off no see that's my whole dealings because we still get that problem of you ain't perfect i ain't perfect and um i know chris mentioned it this weekend and and i believe it that we can't all agree on everything but still there's only one truth okay one truth and that truth has got to come through the bride in the end time alive and remain something's got to be preached that's going to catch me in you and bring us to that perfection well i ain't perfect and you ain't perfect well that's not what the bible said the bible said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect now if the father had stayed in heaven no we wouldn't have got perfect been able to get perfect but see he lowered himself he immorphied in another form called jesus christ so see now i can understand god because he was a human man he walked on the earth he had to eat he had to sleep he had to do the things of the world not things of the world you understand but he had to eat he worked in the carpenter shop he wasn't just like you know he didn't walk in there this high everywhere he went and i don't believe that you know the catholics have this little halo all the way around him all the time you know this little glow uh no he was head no one understood him it would have been it would have been totally uh he would have been accepted by everybody if he'd walked in you know and dirt just fall off of him you know they spit on him and it just gets right here and stops you understand what i mean and everything he did was so perfect but he was so hid as a human being so they did not know who he was they called him everything but god amen amen that's the god i serve he showed me how to do it he showed me through jesus christ how to live this not say this message to live this bible which is the message of the hour and i'm like brother bob there's no way in heaven or hell that you can leave this message and be mourning him no way you can't pull yourself away from god if you've got god inside of you amen you just can't do it hey listen you might get confused we all do you might say well i don't understand that but when you say that ain't it and he's a liar and i'm leaving no you got a problem but god sent us a word of promise watch what this is in revelations 3 14 the angel the church the layout of sins right these things saith the amen the faithful true witness the beginning of the creation of god he's going to have a creation just like he wanted in the garden of eden got to quit beating on the pulpit they got on to me i went you know in april i went and preached chris's easter meeting and he had a brand new pulpit sent all the way from ohio some amish had made it for him and it's just a beautiful uh made out of aspen and all kind of wood and that wood's just a little bit it's a little bit soft it's not like oak so i beat on it about 25 times during that weekend and it got beats and bangs all over it and chris told me he said you know what he said i kind of like that so he just took a hammer and bit and beat all around it put the little pop marks on it so sorry about that but get excited about god you ought to try it sometime the beginning of the creation of god and listen to this let's go to psalms 85 9. brother dale preached on this long i mean 20 years ago i remember him preaching on this psalm 85 verse 9 surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land now here's the book of psalms here's david here's david a prophet mercy and truth are met together god and man become one righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth will read this this afternoon a little bit different than we're reading it today truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven when god and man met heaven and earth kissed each other righteousness and peace kissed each other and became a man named jesus christ and man we'll get into that a little bit more i want to just keep going because we gotta we gotta get to a point here now look let's go to number two god's gift always finds their places it'll be all right and man this new year we we gotta go we gotta go we just gotta keep going this new year we got you know if you got uh if we got we all got issues and i'm ready to get rid of them you ought to be able to get rid of try to get rid of yours too some of us we i'm going to stop just a minute we baby our issue jim's got a sister that's got she takes 75 pills a day she's got every problem in the world but she's kind of one of those people that you know if god went by and said i'm going to heal you of everything you got she wouldn't do it some people love misery some people love to be sick so you can pity them we get out of that hey man stand up and go i don't want to feel bad i felt bad for a year i felt bad for a year it's time to quit feeling bad it's time to say i can't come to church because my nose is itching you know what it is it's babies rocking babies you don't get a lot when baby rocks a baby but when an adult gets a hold of a baby do the right thing you sit on the front row you're going to get picked on but look brother brown said he's a being on earth a being of time that's what that that baby had to be born according to the old testament come down into time all right i'm getting something which means that he must have had a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in god himself created a body for himself but listen see it had to come by the word because look as his original as his original body his flesh body came by the word he couldn't become any different because he requires that his spiritual body come the same way by the word his spiritual body's got to come by the word because his natural body came by the word amen so that see that's where we can have confidence that god came just like he said he was going to come in the old testament and you and i according to the old and new testament are going to come the exact same way we got to have these virtues and they're the virtues of god they're the virtues of god that we couldn't understand until a man walked on the shores of galilee and it's recorded that virtue went from him it's recorded that he had the mind of god because he was god temperance patience we'll talk about that this afternoon created a body for himself that by this creation he might save the lost creation that he created all right now we know his body was not eternal yours wasn't either all right it's being made eternal his was being made eternal see how close he was he was so hid in that flesh nobody understood who he was nobody did even the devil had questions about it if you be the son of god do this if you be you think him being a spiritual being that was so close to that spiritual being that was in heaven he would have felt that same feeling but god was so wrapped up in that flesh till he hit him he hid him from the devil himself i believe that all right now let's go to the next one real quick loudest in church now show that he was the first how could god be created if he's a spirit how could he be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created we're talking about the son of god the creator the one that was before the foundation of the world but remember there's an in morphing or a changing of form of this man you can't understand to a man you can't understand can understand all right how could it be he's eternal he never was created he never will be created because he was god at the beginning listen he was so head to the world but don't we know how he was supposed to come didn't the prophets know how he was supposed to come they saw a vision that vision was projected on a piece of paper called an old testament what was written in the old testament all of us can pick up today and read scriptures about this man i'm talking about right so is it head to the world yes but for all those of us that can read the bible and have the new birth it's an open book for us so we can read that he came exactly the way he was supposed to come you and i are coming exactly the way we're supposed to come you say no this is a mess well listen in all this mess we're going to be blessed god's going to get the glory because satan says hey i got dibs on that i got dibs on that because you came the wrong way you came the way i made you come in the garden and god's like okay that's fine but i'm going to create myself a body ain't going to come from what you said was in the garden i'm going to create one i'm going to come down here and i'm going to save that group of people what almighty god we serve we're sister johnny when you need her what almighty god we serve but he that is the beginning of the creation of god was jesus christ when he was made manifest in other words when the word of promise was unveiled what is god what is jesus christ he's god unveiled veiled in human flesh but unveiled to me in you amen the book was closed now the book's open he's the beginning of the creation of god he came down and lived in it oh isn't he wonderful and what did he want what broke in the garden of eden that god wanted back fellowship he said adam i can't fellowship with you no more eve i can't fellowship with you no more you got to go out of the presence of god i've got to drive you out because i can't stand what you just did right man but there was a blood covering that god was looking through when that happened if not he'd had to kill them and start over again so there was a blood covering but god wanted that fellowship back where he could walk down the cooler today say hey adam how you doing that's what he's going to do when we get to the future home i believe we're going to be able to see jesus any time we want to and he's going to say hey how you doing you having a good day today yeah man i've been over it i've been in antarctica for about 50 million years over walking around on that ice it's pretty warm over there ain't that the way you go do you not think that man i think that way and i want god to show me things of how the world developed how the world literally developed now not all the sand and junk but i want to see how this one they said that you know that we populated north america when we come over the from russia to the polar ice you know they walked across that bridge or whatever it was and i'd like to see that you know what he said he'd give you the desire of your heart and we won't need a big old screen up there all you do is just say i want to be there and you'll be standing where it's supposed to be see that's what we're heading to but you know what that's what god was before this started too i'll be here how can god be right here talking to talking to this brother and be in china saving another brother remember it's a personal revelation so he's got to be the person how can he do that only god can do that i don't i can't do that see that's why i'm not the fullness of the godhead body only in one person i was thinking about this the other night you know you you take the the whole of christendom in the 60s 50s 60s there was only a few faith healers on the earth if you wanted to get healed you had to go see oral roberts billy graham different ones brother branham right so it was kind of closed up all right but now we're the fullness of the godhead bible and we're in every country in the world there's healings going on now in antarctica because there's a church up there there's believers there's bride where it couldn't have happened in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s it was so it was so pulled down to one place you had to go to a tent to get your healing you had to go to a community you had to go to a meeting you don't have to do that now we're scattered all over the world but it's the fullness of the godhead bodily the fullness of this world is going to be what is going to be populated by what little jesus is little gods amen oh isn't he wonderful now we know in luke 2 verse 49 jesus was a kid they found him in the temple he said what's not i'll be about my father's business that'll be the next one he come to nazareth though it was subject under his parents verse 52 says and jesus increased in wisdom and stature not statue we knew we know he grew in statue because he would grow but stature is that what development right increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man hebrews 5 verse 8 though he were a son see though he were a son and we go back to uh we will talk about a little bit later about adoption though you're a son though you're a son you're born a son of god you're born a son in the in the in the economy of god you're born a dale or a black or whatever you want you're you're born that when you get born again you're a born-again believer but you're a baby you don't come full grown you're a b.a.b why baby problem is is the 60 year old baby and if you're 60 i'm not talking about you let's say 61. not you broke kyle you're a little bit older than that yet learned look yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered that's why i'm telling you jesus as a human being made mistakes not in the word not in what we say oh he made a mistake he was looking at that prostitute no no he made mistakes like brother dale said he thought god was so divine that he couldn't stop stop his toe i believe if he hit a rock while he was running and it hit his toe he fell and you know what he probably had scrapes all the way down his arm just like you do so that's why i don't believe that if he if he fell 40 feet he broke something i'm just that way he was so much veiled in flesh till they didn't know who he was like i said before if he had come walking in the temple and and he looked like he had a um a neon light you know you know pulsating off of his body and he walks in and he points his finger at the ark and has it moved with his finger see that said oh that's god that's god he's finally here no he walked in and he said unless you believe that i'm he you'll die in your sins and he probably was wiping his nose man had blood running off his fingers from getting in the carpenter shot with his daddy and hit the wrong nail y'all never done that before hit these nails instead of the nails that you're supposed to hit yeah it's what's up so you learned he obedience by the things which he suffered look and being made perfect now listen he came the perfect son of god but he came as the son of man all right everybody got that i'm not saying jesus was not perfect in his doctrine he was perfect but in his humanity they didn't know who he was same way with me and you how you know we're the bride of jesus christ and here we are walking through the world we get covered we have to go to the doctor we have to go but it's our confession it's our confession we got to keep confessing it keep confessing that you are what you are even though we might look horrible to the world the day jesus was crucified the world said that can't be god god would not let that happen right caiaphas said can't even save himself he said he could save others can't even save himself wow what's a mission he learned to bring these now listen i believe jesus christ was god almighty and human flesh and he didn't have to get virtue he had it already but he had to learn how to use it everybody okay with that he had to learn how to use it i just read he learned by the things that he suffered he learned that that's why that you see jesus's ministry started when he was 30 years old my he had 30 years that we don't know much about except for just a few minutes in the temple when he was 13 years old so he developed he learned virtue knowledge he learned how to use it me and you were born in sin we were born on this side of the chasm we didn't come with the virtue of god in us because peter would have said just let what's inside of you live no he said add add to your faith virtue add to your faith knowledge and look he says and being made perfect he became the author huh what is an author he writes a book and that book you read and when you read the book and he talks about itself and you see the characteristics and you see the word be made manifest that's my kind of author it's non-fiction it was written by the man that went through it and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation look not just anybody unto all them that obey him everybody got that so jesus came here with the virtues but learned how to bring him through his flesh you and i were born with a carnal mind we don't have the virtue of god we've got to get the new birth first that's why we got to be born again that's why jesus started with his first doctrine you got to be born again nicodemus you're a good guy but you got to be born again everybody okay now let's skip to matthew three i'm not gonna get finished with this i wanted to get to a spot i'll get to it anyway if i have to get get through something john 3 when jesus was baptized he went straight way out of the water the low the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him a little voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased now why didn't jesus why didn't god why didn't that voice go ahead and say hear you him because he didn't say that to you when you got born again he said i'm pleased to dwell in that vessel but you got to learn those virtues you've got to learn that i'm fixing to put it in you like we're going to read in a little while the divine nature of god has got to be put in what is the divine nature of god but you got to get bored again first before you can quicken any of these virtues because yes i agree 100 when you get born again you get all you need for your journey amen when thomas was born he got every part he'll ever have he's not going to grow another one right your hair might get a little longer you might grow some fuzzy on your face but it always still inside of you my hormones and all that it's not something you had to acquire all you had to do was eat same way with this all you got to do is eat they're there but what they're laying there you gotta learn how to control virtue power without character is satanic but power with character what is character that's the character of god but power with character see jesus the head because he's the headstone born right the first time he controlled all that he so controlled itself to when he went to calvary he was done he could have moved his finger listen he could have thought in his mind i need help and there would have been legions of angels come and just destroyed the earth and took him off that cross but you know what didn't want that he had that control and like i said i've always told y'all we don't you don't sin in your soul if you're born again you don't sin in your flesh your flesh just isn't it just what puts it in motion see takes phil smelling here that's where god and satan both that's that as chris was talking about the conflict between god and satan the conflict is you and it's in your brain up here that's the conflict you are the conflict aren't we the conflict don't the conflicting thing of me is is that like paul says the things i would not i do the things i do that i don't want to do i do them anyway now that didn't mean that he was once a drunk and he went back to being a drunk no he knew he was a human being he had desires feelings emotions and all these different things that he was trying to get in control and not let it control him see that's our problem sometimes we let other things control us and that's why i read you the scripture a minute ago about having preeminence you know what preeminence is complete control that he might have the preeminences full control of me and you when brother bradham stepped out of the way that's why that's our sign brother brown wasn't a son of man but it was a sign the sign was brother brown said what did i just say he was so out of the way he was so out of the picture he didn't even know what he was saying right now he said what did i just say and somebody'd have to tell him i remember one time i was listening the other day he said i had to go back and listen to the tape to see what i said that's being so much out of the way you don't even know what you're talking about but some of us get that way come on people it's that four inch pipe is greased from your brain to your mouth and we don't control it but you know what if you let god take that four inch pipe he can take what that what he gives you because we have to process it through our brain brother brown had to process everything through his brain except when he was in discernment he didn't have to do that what did i say i barely remember he uh you know billy paul said sit for hours after he'd take him to the hotel he just lay down in the bed because he was numb brother brown said one time he said i was numb for days after something happened can you imagine being numb and out of it where you don't even know where you're at for days just because what did you do you moved yourself out of the way and let god take over but now i believe though coming to the end time right now we're not going to be that way i'm just going to tell you if we come to a place of resurrection and we've come to a place of speaking the word of god it's not going to hurt us like it did him he was one man taking that whole load on him now that load is being dispersed i don't have to be william branham i can be myself and have my part in the body you can have your part in the body you can have your revelation and your resurrection and your power and your authority but it all comes under the headship of that man right there now when we come out from under headship what was problem with eve she came out from under headship what's the first person that was standing there when she came out of headship satan he deceived the bride the first time she moved out of headship right that's what happened with the nominations there was a baptist bride folks can somebody amen i'll read you a quote where brother mom said they had the word at one time but what did they do moved out from under the headship of the word of god took their own ideas and run with it that's why they're illegitimate brother brown calls them prostitutes why they've moved out from under headship they've done just what he did that's why that we have now in the end time got to come back under headship of the son of man and be able to live this life is everybody okay with this i want to make sure that we get i don't want you to know one thing for sure jesus wasn't wrong we've heard preachers well i haven't heard but i heard a preacher preaching one time that it said jesus did said things wrong you know he might have said tuesday was wednesday i don't know but he never ever according to the word of god said anything contrary to his father now listen we do hello somebody we do all the time but there's got to come down a time to where that's kind of what take over as it did that little five foot five foot five inch man from kentucky where he took complete control of his body and one time he said this is not william branham you're hearing right he said this is me i'm just using his voice please let him use our voice if he uses our voice we are then perfect that's why i said folks we need to let out what we got inside of us let it go there's a lot of things we really do need to let go amen now us look the bible in romans 8 says that you and i right you and i this adoption we are to be manifested sons of god now listen jesus was the son of man and that's what he manifested nothing different right so the son of god's been manifested down through church ages are okay with that get them saved get them in church get them to quit doing the things they were doing but you see you got luther you got luther that come out of the catholic church and god anointed him to do a job and brought people in the body of christ sitting in a pub drinking beer and smoking his pot we can't do that because we've got a furthermore of the word the book's been open the book wasn't open when he had it when luther was there even when wesley was there even pentecost but what did pentecost do they were under headship the holy ghost fell in 1906 is industry the word of god to restore the gifts but what happened they said this is it there's no more so they stepped out from under headship god said i can't use you anymore because you've defiled yourself with man's ideas so i'm gonna bring a prophet on the scene and that prophet's gonna restore not just the gifts back in the church the gifts were already restored when brother brown came on the scene he didn't have to restore the gifts the gifts were already working but what were they doing they said well this is it they get up and somebody go to shouting and speaking in tongues while the preacher was preaching it wasn't in order the prophet of god had to do like elijah when those prophets had beat the altar down what do you do he put them all he restored fellowship and he restored how to have a church he restored fellowship what a man that could talk to god like brother branham i mean come on people have you ever had god come down and and brother brown said stand right there beside me and say come and walk with me come walk with me now he wasn't standing there physically but you understand when he was up there you know he's hunting and the deer did what they did you know they came up to him remember what god say come and walk with me and there was a prophet walking down down a deer trail with god beside him he so reverenced god till god felt comfortable with walking with him god felt comfortable using his voice yes god felt comfortable using his mind to write notes to preach us 1100 sermons which was god talking to us not william branham that's why if you turn william branham down in the voice you turn god down now the things he did the things he did first i don't care i don't care if he got a date wrong but what happened when he was out there he got a commission to go back to jeffersonville and open the book that's good enough for me you can you know there's been all kind of dissertations on the cloud whatever you want to believe i just bottom line he showed me god he showed me how to get access to god he showed me in the word where no denomination ever showed me how to get to god nobody else showed me how to get to god what he preached showed me how to get to god and why the why of it why because we were lost even though we had a a decent understanding of religion in the baptist and the methods and pentecostals and different churches we'd have the full understanding we'd live a peace and then the peace would be left out we could live a peace and the peace would be left out luther lived to peace but a peace got left out right that's the same way with us but see the bible says but when the fullness has come not just faith first your knowledge temper face of godliness brother kindness the headstone that's why the holy ghost is up there not down at the bottom we know we get faith we get the baptism of the holy ghost because it's the divine nature of god we'll talk about that tonight this afternoon but that holy spirit seals that in it what does it do it puts a stamp yes this is my beloved son now you hear what he's saying he put his stamp of approval on the mountain in matthew and said you got to hear this guy let's skip to that brothers let's go to matthew 17 verse 8. real quick because i want to get right here then we'll start this afternoon i hope this is helping us to realize what our commission is not just to come to church that's what i was thinking last night i said lord have you ever been honest with yourself and said lord i didn't get anything out of that service brother brian said you either get better you leave that door better or worse i've left that door worse because i didn't pay attention to everything that was being said i had stuff in my head but you know what there's days i walked out that door just like when chris was preaching the other day i wrote one word down and i'll preach about ten sermons on that one word and i'm gonna tell you what i do but it's got something to do with surgery but i wrote that down and then you and that's the way god works so see i had fellowship that fellowship with what what what he said that word i got you probably got another one you probably could you probably can remember a phrase he said that i can't remember why because we're a body we're a body but when we bring it together it's got a dovetail it can't be like this you can't you can't hear what brother chris said and get a wrong doctrine if i heard him and got a right doctrine somebody's wrong you both can't be right as brother brown said you both can't be right so this is on the mountain god had just identified and put a stamp of approval on jesus in tithe listen he was almighty god but i believe he came to a place he learned by the things he suffered and being made perfect he's come to a place that now he can go to calvary and say not my will but thy will be done that's right everybody okay all right let's listen right here when they lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged him saying tell the vision in other words tell what that do not tell what you saw so that they were in a vision remember they looked up and saw elijah and moses and jesus had to be a vision and then a a cloud comes down and a voice out of the clown okay i like what brother chris was preaching i loved everything he's preaching but the symbols watch those symbols they're symbols but they have a meaning to them everything has a meaning to it doesn't matter if you're in a concert with a thousand uh musicians everybody's got a note to play and if you toot when you're supposed to not everybody hear it and it's off amen when you're supposed to pause and somebody goes you know there's something wrong all right look we'll be done right here sorry tell the vision to no man why'd he say that nobody's gonna understand it because peter says i have a more sure word of prophecy i was on that mountain i saw what happened but i didn't understand what happened because peter's wanting to build tabernacles three of them i bet he reversed his thought process when he got the holy ghost because he never mentioned it again except one time he said i have now a more sure word of prophecy i was on the mountain that day but see the word of prophecy is now that jesus is almighty god they didn't know he was almighty god right here they didn't have the new birth you can't know that jesus you say oh i know jesus is one he's almighty god you're just quoting what somebody said until you get the new birth and then that speaks back out from you you're just presuming that's what brother brown said he said we we're only presuming if he don't come and show us these things tell the vision no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead so in other words he had to die he's going to be risen again because of this and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that he lost must first come they went to malachi malachi said behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and reference of the lord they're quoting malachi same scripture we're quoting but jesus said to them eli shall truly i'm sorry elise truly shall first come and restore all things john the baptist did not restore all things he introduced the messiah he didn't restore he turned them back sure he turned some of them back but see that's why brother branham had to do the two things the elijah ministry had to do the two things turn us back to what to where we can understand that we need these things and then bring the headstone message not just bring a regular message that's right let's go to psalms 118. magicians get ready to come we'll read about three scriptures then we'll start on that this afternoon i will praise thee for thou has heard me in art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused which the builders refused it's become the headstone of the corner become the headstone they rejected him they killed him they cut him off but he came right back down here on the day of pentecost and started again to build his church back amen he had a church in the old testament they rejected him come out from under headship killed him actually this is the lord's doing it is marvelous listen has this become marvelous has this become a marvelous message or is it just something that we do and it's something to say well i got something that that guy don't have over there no you're wrong you're like the pharisee that stands up and says lord i'm gonna pray so loud that he'll drown that old guy over there out he's just a center he don't look at him and now and like jesus said look look there he is over there on his knees crying out to god for forgiveness okay ephesians 2 verse 19 says now therefore you are no more strangers than foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god now that puts you in the body and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone listen he lowered himself down he lowered himself down to be the head of the corner what the head of this new race the head of this new church that was coming and they had their mistakes he went he had to wink at luther smoking a pipe and drinking beer but he said luther you preached just i lived by faith that's what i want you to preach because the people are going to get that right then he moved to wesley okay now look in whom all the building fitly frame together dies withers oh groweth oh growlithe oh sorry groweth unto a temple in the lord where's that temple it's in your flesh in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of god this is my beloved son this is my beloved tabernacle in whom i am so pleased to dwell he's so pleased to dwell that he's going to see you for an eternity and not be ashamed the bible says it's not be ashamed to call his bro call him brother right see your brother listen there's not anybody going to get into that city bride and god say i really didn't want them here i mean really now outside the city he gives people eternal life and i was thinking about this other day you know we know that jesus is coming soon is everybody okay with that but it's a secret coming as a thief in the night listen when the world says jesus is coming on this day or coming on this forget it you and i are the only people we're just going to be caught away now listen i know we invited guests 40-something years ago my lovely wife's watching in now 42 years ago almost 43. but now they didn't all go on the honeymoon with us it was just me and her we invited all these guests they got to come to the wedding but there was one woman walking down that aisle and i went home with that one woman man yesterday did you bug i got lonely you can say all if you want to oh she's been gone since thursday which was thursday like seven years ago and i told the people at work i said look i said i got this friend and his wife leaving him and he needs some food so i went and got me some food last night because june didn't fix me nothing because she wasn't there to fix it for me bless her heart so now listen let me tell you this little story so i get in the car and i leave commerce and something just impressed me not to go the regular way home which would be go down deadweiler or go to uh yarber's crossing and turn and go through maysville and come up to the house go to homer so i turned went to homer that's where june and i were raised i turned left on yonohoma road and i went by the place that we first got married a little trailer that we first lived mom and dad helped us clean that thing up and it was a pigsty right mom mama i think even gay we literally opened the doors this is how this is a story we literally opened the doors and took water and washed but i got it for a good deal it was just me and her we were so much in love it didn't matter if we lived in a cardboard box would have been a little rough but but we found this trailer and it was a mess but we cleaned that up and from that beginning 42 years 42 years oh yeah had our ups and downs no doubt but 42 years i drove by that place and i said god thank you that i met a woman that would put up with me number one i see go ahead go ahead sit there all [Applause] but could put up with me for 42 years but think about god god remembers the first day you got born again the first day you said i want you god to be my husband it might have been in a little trailer it might have been a little shack brother brown said it may have been out in the middle of the swamp right but isn't that when you get married it's when you accept god in you in your life and it was a simple time we didn't have no kids we could just throw clothes in the car and go see her mom and dad and you know be there in in a couple a few hours and we'd just throw enough clothes and then when we started having kids it took like a week for us to decide we wanted to go and then another week to get everything ready and then six or seven days to get over there it was only a four-hour drive but you see how life is though life became a little bit complicated but still i go back and remember they sold the old trailer and put a double wide there and it's still there actually from the 40-something years since we lived there but i thought lord i'm horrible i was a horrible person when june and i got married but i loved her she loved me despite all the stupid stuff i did that's how god does he says i remember you when you were young i remember when i first went home with you we first built our christian experience together i remember that and i love it i've loved you from the beginning doesn't matter what you do you have your trials and tribulations and now 42 years later i know she's crying 42 years later we're still in love like little kids still in love why because now we got god in our life to tell us yes how to love you know listen you can have love out in the world and it becomes lust and all these different things but you can't have agape love of god and that world have anything to do with you and him also are building together for inhabitation see i built her a habitation it may have been a rough place at first when we first had to sweep it and clean it out and get all the roaches out but you know what it was home it was the house it was warm in the winter and no it was warm in the summer and cold in the winter pretty much i don't even know if the furnace worked but you know what that's your humble beginnings all of you has been that way i hope all of you can remember when you got married i hope you can all remember the day you got born again because it was way better than the day you got first married but you know what it parallels itself god said he'd build you a habitation he's going to dwell on you temporarily i say temporarily hang on a minute but your real home is that future home he built before the foundation of the world built according to your desires and it's somewhere in a dimension probably number seven i say it's in a dimension waiting to weaken what heaven and earth can kiss it's what we're looking for heaven and earth is kissed now between me and you and the bride you know the bridegroom jesus christ but there's going to be a literal time we're going to be able to walk with that man he's built us a house all those 42 years you and i walk together like i said trials and tribulations and troubles but she's my wife and that's just a pinhead that's just a molecule of water compared to the ocean that god's going to give us at the new birth but he's working in your flesh now we are now sons and daughters of god not only sons and daughters of god we're the bride of jesus christ and he's built us a place let's read this one thing you know you ought to go back sometime go back to where you were unless it's way off but just kind of go back and reminisce a little bit i know some people i had terrible marriage i'm sorry but think about the day you got born again now that the love of god came into your heart and you couldn't not love somebody else you just love everybody let's read second peter 1 3 and the musicians come on according as his divine power this is what we're going to get to this afternoon look look at all this work what is divine there's only one thing divine that's god nobody else is divine one divine according as his divine power has given unto us all things pertaining unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of that divine nature having escaped the corruption like i said before that is in the world through lust there is no lust in agape love now filio love there's a lot of it but not in agape love there is not right musicians come we'll sing a song before we dismiss but just think about what god's done for you you truly get born again that's when you start living you're dead as a hammer until you get born again right you don't even know what you're doing amen that's why i drew you in the name of the lord jesus this year know that you know that you're born again because only the born-again is going in the rapture no one else let's stand our feet only the born-again is going in the rapture no one else i want to see my bridegroom yes oh i've met him spiritually i've seen him in the word i've seen pictures of him i've never felt him handed a hand oh we felt his presence but we're going to literally be with him whatever you do on this earth it it pales in comparison to what's coming we can have we can you know jen and i've had a good life we've had a a really good life and uh but it doesn't compare to what what if we were both just sinners though and we just loved each other with felio love and then we just went through the world had a couple kids and you know what then we just pass away that's it but no we got boarding in one day and that's an assurance of number one you're going to make it and it's also an assurance that we had a prophet thank god that says you'll be with that woman for the rest of your for the eternity that'll be your wife you'll know it for an eternity now you won't be out you won't be doing things of nature but that'll be your wife amen that'll be the one when our
