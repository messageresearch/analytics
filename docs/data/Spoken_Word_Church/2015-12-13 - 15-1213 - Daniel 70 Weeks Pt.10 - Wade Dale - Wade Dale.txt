========================================

and according to the Bible we're going to put it in here now look look listen why don't start on Sunday all time just for illustration purposes on the beginning here because remember the first day of nisin are a bit started when you were coming up to the end of a dark which is there near last month of the Jewish calendar two people would go out look if they didn't see the moon and that's what confused me at first but it doesn't confuse me now because you say will you if you add another 30 days you're pushing it no you drop back and go through the same month again because if you added another month you wouldn't be pushing it forward you go back and start it eight are one again and come back so you you live the same month you don't live the same month you just put 30 days here but it's 30 days twice in the last month didn't depend on the calendar like we did no they don't nothing they depend on the moon stars and all that remember me then you know they may have a calendar but it didn't look like this for sure how they write why did it because you would name you would think you would think in a dar if they didn't see the moon if they saw sliver they started the next month if it was a dark side of moon they just drop back and started this all over again hey are one is not a tower third can't week because it would push it this way no they drop back and do a tower again go see if you did add another one you start pushing your feast days out of the spring all right so they just drop back and see that keep sitting that keeps it in line nobody got that same after that to me that's very simple you go now here we got we got more months on the backside but the ones that are really important i wrote the dates down now let's reading on leviticus 23 now look and the lord spake unto moses saying speaking to the children of Arizona saying to them concerning the Feast of the Lord these are not Israel thief these are the Lord speaks that he come and Israel to that required them to keep so they're not feast of Israel their Feast of the Lord is what the Bible says Feast of the Lord which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are who my feast all right six days shall work be done with the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest now see there's only one day that's a salad there's only one day that they're required to keep in that Saturday their Sabbath this saturday nobody got that number seven days our Sabbath is on Saturday that's why Jesus had to come off the cross because really right here's where he was crucified they couldn't take him off that cross the next day because you can't do anything on this Sabbath this is the only day they were required r 7 is the Jewish name for it okay six days shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest and holy convocation and convocation means to call together all right okay if I get too fast we'll finish it will go a little bit later but I want you to get this in yet and you in your cranium for a little one these are the Feast of the Lord verse 4 even holy convocations with ye show proclaiming their seasons and the fourteenth day of the first month and eating them remember six o'clock starts their day 6 p.m. evening 6pm starts to jewish day 12 midnight like we do alright so if they even is the Lord's Passover on the fourteenth and a look here's nissen let's say it starts on Sunday the first you come down 14 days now look if that Passover dead fall on the Sabbath it was a high holy day you got to blessings because you have to do anything it's a Passover fell over here you still went to work it's just in the evening when you at home you would eat the Passover there we go that those days move you got to remember the days moved it's like our days minute okay you got it but it says the fourteenth day of the month it doesn't say it says the 14th I said write him up in the fourteenth day of the first month and even is the Lord's Passover got it now what did that days when did that they start it started at six o'clock friday afternoon got it it started six o'clock friday afternoon then you gotta look at your days a little different even on the calendar but that Passover started 6 p.m. on friday afternoon so that's the 14th day to them hey got it that's the fourteenth day of them not don't worry about our day I was a fourteenth day to then one six o'clock that's why Jesus was killed actually pass over fellow and friday he was killed before six o'clock right they put him in the ground which was the feast of unleavened bread the passover lamb was killed 6 p.m. after that he was already dead they put him in the ground unleavened bread then he raised on firstfruits he with the firstfruits up from the dead they got that same man that's according to the Bible from now the fourteenth day of the first months were silent evening is the Lord's Passover and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread right here here we go nothing hmm alright and for seven days you must eat unleavened bread so for seven straight days you'll eat unleavened bread you still went to work do all these things but on that Sabbath day you didn't do anything all right from now in the first day you shall have a holy convocation you should do no sirve I'll work there in which you show off or an offering minute by fire to the board seven days in the seventh day of the holy convocation you should do no sirve I'll word there in all right and the Lord spake unto moses under the children is will send them when you come into the land which are given to you and shall reap the harvest their own their up then you shall raise sheep with the first fruits of the harvest it unto the priest you shall wear the sheet before the lord to be accepted for you that's why they kept having to put that extra month into x get up so when they planted you got you gotta remember too we say oh that's late don't mean that's early not to them their climate is different than ours they could plant in January of our year and come up this was a day of firstfruits somewhere in right in here without first crop came up release reading and he shall waive the sheep before the Lord would be accepted for you and tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall waive it all right so if the what if this but if that day falls on the Sabbath he had to wait till the next day cuz remember you can't do anything on seven good all right and he shall offer that day when you wave the sheep and he lamb without blemish in the first year from burnt offering to the Lord and then it keeps going down food too tense deal now watch verse 15 he shall count unto you from tomorrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the Sheep wave of the offering no up watch okay this is the Sabbath alright then you guys start counting 50 days from there so it's not exactly right here read right here and you shall count into you from tomorrow after the Sabbath whatever the Sabbath is on one Saturday all right when tomorrow after the Sabbath from the day that you brought the sheep of the way walking seven Silas she'll be completed seven seven one two three four five six seven that puts it and sevan 10 on our book let's see how God is right there the same thing same thing got it what's in the same month got that so there's why pick off their pen comes when a damn pic also fully come we're nine days and then you what watch even into tomorrow after the seven tablets show you number 50 days you shall offer a new meat offering it to the Lord you shall bring your offering two loads of two tents deal now this is where you put 11 back in because Levin is a type of this thing right okay so you put in Lebanon they shall be baking wind 11 rise what does leben do makes bread rise right they are the firstfruits unto the Lord and you shall offer with the bread seven lamp and then it keeps going down through there all right and it's a holy convocation you don't even do anything on that day and what happens in verse 22 verse 22 is you got starting to reap the harvest so you gotta jump now jump to where verse 24 in the seventh month what is your seventh month on the calendar you've got to move whatever you got to lose you got off te lo capo man save tape okay fine well these big enough to have 12 months on hey brother Louise hand me that tape and they'll know dad please sir or just bring me a couple of pieces and put it right here bring the cup yeah yeah do it over retro mahila go all right now that work how's the box so now we've come up to what Tess tree which is the seventh month of these their year okay if I ok just explain it may be a little bit more smaller than flat but we're going by Bible listen what the Bible said what's been the Bible all the time alright speak to the children is reverse 24 into seventh month what is the seventh month history October September someone there I got now remember you said you first fruits the firstfruits with the first ones that was coming up this is the harvest the firstfruits was the first thing coming up out of the ground this is this will be what we get to the school in the seventh month and the first day of month show you how the Sabbath so you make your own Sabbath but in this one on ours it fell on the first on Friday you understand what I'm saying I just wrote these in consecutive order and that's what it felt but it's 30 days every month that's why it comes off of this thing and it's off got it you shall have a sale Sabbath have a moral of blowing of trumpets a holy convocation so the feasts of the trumpets is on the first day of October September tesserae it's on your time you've been on there the whole time looking these two trumpet right here on the first day of of test ring all right now you sure do know survive work which is you offer an offer and later than fire to the Lord and the Lord spake unto moses saying also on the tenth day of the seventh month one two three four five seven nine ten there she'll be a day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation under you and you shall afflict your soul and offer an offering made by fire until the Lord you shall do no work in that same day for it is a day of atonement all right excuse me to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God what so ever sold it be that shall not be a fleet to that same day he shall be cut off from among the people all right and whatsoever soul would be that do it any work in that same day the same so will I destroy from among his people Wow concierge huh it shall be unto you birth 32 a Sabbath of rest and you shall Swift your soul in the ninth day of the month an evening from even into even even evening that's evening from evening till evening show you celebrate your sabbath from evening to even got it Jordan half day you got to remember the night day at six o'clock starts patek day but same from evening to even write to me that part was confusing but now if you'll just understand their day starts at 6pm when you come up with each p.m. they start the next day you got remember they're really close to the equator to kinda like jamaican their time don't change like ours does their son usually even in jamaica their sun goes down six clocks his clocks its clock 630 sometimes might vary a little bit but not like ours you know i was going down now six cloth it's dark when the summertime it nine o'clock is still daylight three hours swing when you get closer to the equator remember equator stays right here but when it turns this goes away from the schneider goes toward the Sun but your pivot point is right about the equation so it kind of stays so their days stay pretty much six o'clock he gets started gets dark Frodo they change the time that we're over here I don't think that not Jamaican does not so I don't think they do it do I know some of our state's don't like Indiana faint other things so I think it's just left up really the one grids and they change it is because of school kids getting on the bus at darden getting home at dark know like stuff if you left it the same way that's why they call it daylight savings time I can remember when it wasn't remember in the early 60s I remember when they didn't have daylight saving time but the kids you know two three accidents or something happened it being dark dark dark one kid killing the bus take kids get on bus against daylight now six clocks is burning all right look here to started going bust em up know them but now you if you left it an hour back up then you know kids you get on a darksome now we're getting home a dark sometimes in the winter all right so now only how we got on that but we did trumpets day of atonement we're going right by the bottom now verse 34 speaking to the turbulence and a fifteenth day right the fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacle for seven days until or so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 days unto the lord on the first day she'll be a holy convocation you shall do no sirve I'll work there in seven days you shall offer an offering made by firing to the Lord on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you that's for brother Ram gets that eighth day talking about the future hunt at the future home in the future home to come back you know you got sevens and sevens and seven this is on the eighth day so there's a one two three four five six seven and on the eighth day they have a holy convocation alright usual offer an offering made by firing to the Lord is a solemn assembly you shall do no sirve I'll work there in and then on a 15,000 seventh month this is what happens they go get verse 39 you gather the fruit of the land tip of e seven days on the first case you'll be seven only eight days you'll be stopped no work alright then they take what they're doing is they take me build these boots together verse 42 and you should dwell in booths seven days all then there is our Lots born your dwelling boots all right you make this little boost and you sit in there's a reason for that and we'll get into that a little bit later okay but is everybody got it now how this how this calendar is working better than you did with the wheel okay oh you owe you these days are on the first part of the year the feast days here are in september-october harvest I'm okay harvest I'm so now this these three are very important because I want you to see something because when we get into that 70th week remember Jesus fulfilled all the first feast but not the last piece all right mr. trumpets it's an awakening gathering all right feast of atonement is what doing away with all the sin and tight okay 11 no nothing the Day of Atonement you'll flip your soul now then you've got the Feast of Tabernacles now if you'll remember brother around preach the Feast of Trumpets all CT trumpets are all seven trumpets sound under the sixth seal which is the two witnesses index 70th week preaching to Israel so there's your time this is going to happen during the time the two prophets are here piece of trumpet now our feast of trumpets is 1st Thessalonians 1552 trumpet awards your sound then cross your eyes leave what you're alive and remain shall be caught up take body chain then work God is going to Tabernacle in us so have been around this message that was a trumpet but that wasn't the whole part doesn't remember the trumpet brings everybody together got it that was this message but he's not going to physically take us out of here his message is going to take us out of here the sound of the trumpet is what's going to bring us together okay cuz he's going on so he's going to be part of that it's going to come up when the trumpet shall sound and song those times he'll be no longer but this is going to be really important because look in that last week the trumpets will be those two prophets preaching to Israel together 144,000 together there will be a Day of Atonement will read it when we get there in Ezekiel can't remember but are in Jeremiah Ezekiel at Botox if I remember they says it that they go into their house and they mourn when those two prophets reveal Jesus Christ to them that they already killed him back 2,000 years ago the Bible says they'll take where did you get those scars and he'll say in the house of my friends right it's not literal Jesus that's true those two prophets right they'll realize that what they'll realize they're atonement we realize our totalement here we r g we're Gentile we realize our thomann here they going to realize that coma in that 70th week you'll ever realize it we got to make an end and reconciliation for iniquity can you remember third anyway the first three guy the first read the first six fold the seats full purpose the first three brains Israel and restores her back that's the day of atonement they're going to realize they killed him two thousand years ago and they're going to flick their soul that's what it says right here hmm and then the tabernacle has got to be built in the Millennium hmm God's already built higher type of that but we don't need one this is it right but they have is equal 42 44 we're reading they have a literal temple that they're going to go to these termina so then she said when you delete it has to be able at seven years they don't build a tabernacle after 1260 days they're just realize that their day of atonement Israel is realizing their day of a coma after those prophets preached 1260 days that's when the acoma is going to be they're going to be killed they're going to be taken up God is going to watch this thing off with a comic they're going to come back and build a millennium temple and we're going to come into it and be the anointing to the temple according to what the prophet of God sing so any questions real quick got about two minutes any questions no they're going to build I wait 144,000 Oh bill and maybe the fish yield you they
