[12:51] unto us all things that pertain unto
[12:54] life and godliness through the knowledge
[12:56] of him that have called us to glory and
[12:59] virtue whereby are given unto us
[13:02] exceeding great and precious promises
[13:04] that by these these promises the star
[13:08] now you might be partakers of the divine
[13:10] nature having escaped the corruption
[13:12] that is in the world through lust and
[13:14] beside this giving all diligence add to
[13:17] your faith virtue and to virtue of
[13:18] knowledge and the knowledge temperance

[13:22] patience godliness and God and to
[13:25] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[13:27] brotherly kindness charity Amen you may
[13:31] be seated
[13:32] the Lord at his blessing to the reading
[13:34] of the word and now we've been quite a
[13:41] time preaching and trying to cover the
[13:48] things that we believe are needful for
[13:53] the day and now where we're living
[13:55] and this is the the greatest hour the
[13:58] Prophet said if he had a change you know
[14:01] of deciding what time or when to come to
[14:04] earth he said he'd be this time the Cosi
[14:07] we're here now at the finality of the
[14:11] word and what we're doing if you're
[14:14] listening we're talking about the
[14:17] disciples and talking about the faith of
[14:21] the fathers and the things you know that
[14:24] they done so remember in that now listen
[14:29] to what I'm saying in that the disciples
[14:31] were writing the word it's more in the
[14:36] statute of a perfect man we've talked
[14:38] about a lot of things and tried to cover
[14:40] things and the Prophet said they had
[14:43] these virtues they had these qualities
[14:46] and things within them when I just
[14:48] remember what he's talking about
[14:51] because he said now virtue as we'll get
[14:54] to it in the mini cities
[14:55] he said now that's not just living a
[14:56] virgin life well I mean you he's not
[15:00] covered not to do that but he's covering
[15:03] that these things are something more
[15:05] valuable to taking place all right
[15:10] than to just say that that's one of the
[15:12] natural things of life that can be a as
[15:17] we'll cover as we go along you can have
[15:20] a nature given faith a nature given
[15:24] virtue all right and that then you could
[15:27] be a virgin in that line and that's well
[15:31] and good that's commendable okay but
[15:34] that's not what the Scriptures talking
[15:36] about in this case so we look at it from
[15:39] what its governing of this word and it
[15:43] it would not agree maybe if you've
[15:47] watched and we will do this as we go
[15:49] along see we could look up the word
[15:53] virtue and he said well that's what that
[15:54] means that this means to be a virgin
[15:55] well that's one definition all right but
[15:58] then you can look it up and and find a
[16:00] the word and it leads into virtuous
[16:04] which would mean the life of Christ
[16:06] living within you well now this is what
[16:09] we're talking about here because really
[16:12] what I want you to think on for a moment
[16:14] before we continue into this that
[16:17] remember these disciples had these
[16:20] virtues
[16:21] all right you realize those virtues gave
[16:24] them the ability to write the word now
[16:33] once you think on that a moment see it's
[16:36] not two virtues and things is not to
[16:38] just living a good life and and doing
[16:41] this and going to church and and and
[16:43] doing everything all that's well and
[16:44] good and part of it all right because
[16:48] you will do that if you're a Christian
[16:51] okay but remember you're talking about a
[16:55] group of people that actually were
[16:59] writing the word Peter in what I've read
[17:03] here from first
[17:05] Peter and then second Peter Peter was
[17:06] writing the scripture he was telling
[17:10] what God was expecting he was bringing
[17:13] God's Word from him down to us and see
[17:18] then it's not just saying well you know
[17:20] we'll get over to temperance that
[17:22] temperance would come to the basis of
[17:25] saying well that just means don't write
[17:26] no liquor don't no alcohol
[17:28] well that's not what that means in this
[17:31] case alright so then we've got to find
[17:35] what is being done for the hour and the
[17:38] time so I want your emphasis to be
[17:41] thinking on this morning on one thing
[17:44] that these disciples are now writing the
[17:48] word it's not just a good life you know
[17:55] come on church I mean that's well and
[17:57] good and is expected and and needs to be
[18:00] a good life right but that's not exactly
[18:05] the lineup of what they're saying that's
[18:08] why the Prophet said virtue doesn't just
[18:10] mean this would be an aversion because
[18:14] that's a natural thing that a nature
[18:19] given virtue or nature given parts of
[18:23] your life can bring you to the basis of
[18:26] these things that we're reading about
[18:31] because there's two different kinds of
[18:34] faith there's two different kinds of
[18:35] virtue two different kinds of knowledge
[18:38] temperance and all I guess one of them
[18:40] is nature given which means you know
[18:43] you've got good neighbors you you got
[18:45] people you like to be around there's
[18:46] people that display a lot of good things
[18:49] in their lives but they're not even
[18:51] Christians right we'll see then there is
[18:56] a Holy Ghost given all right now these
[19:00] virtues no matter what we cover we're
[19:02] start with faith virtue knowledge
[19:04] temperance and I'll remember it's Holy
[19:06] Ghost given His Holy Ghost faith its
[19:11] Holy Ghost virtue is Holy Ghost
[19:13] knowledge is Holy Ghost temperance all
[19:16] right
[19:16] see now that's a higher
[19:18] order are a greater meaning to the word
[19:21] than to take it from the natural word to
[19:25] word that you can have a nature given
[19:28] you know yourself you around people that
[19:31] there's people that are good-natured
[19:33] people as we call it there are good
[19:36] people you know and do a lot of things
[19:38] would help you do anything in the world
[19:39] but don't even claim to be a Christian
[19:42] but then see that's nature given but my
[19:47] emphasis is trying to get you to look at
[19:49] it in this respect this morning as we go
[19:51] along is remember these people were not
[19:55] just listen listen to my wording and
[19:58] then you won't misunderstand they were
[20:00] not just trying to live a good life
[20:02] that's expected of a Christian it's
[20:09] expected of a Christian to live a good
[20:12] life it's expected of a Christian to do
[20:15] good and and and be good and all like
[20:18] that that's expected that's one of the
[20:20] things but that can be that away and
[20:24] still not be what the thing that God
[20:27] wants us to have goes down through time
[20:30] you think of of the time of from Calvary
[20:35] and the coming of the Holy Ghost and
[20:37] coming through the church ages those
[20:39] were great people that gave their life
[20:42] for what they believed that really
[20:47] served God in a deep manner but yet
[20:52] slowly Satan was taking away these
[20:57] virtues that the disciples had right
[21:05] taking away those Holy Ghost given
[21:08] virtues and leaving mankind with a lot
[21:12] of times just natural virtues all right
[21:17] but remember the point in you you get
[21:21] the emphasis of what I'm driving at see
[21:23] the disciples were just not living a
[21:26] good life they were actually leaving the
[21:32] of God and they were actually writing
[21:35] the Word of God right when Peter was
[21:40] saying add to your faith virtue or
[21:42] knowledge temperance play he was writing
[21:44] God's Word when he was just saying that
[21:47] we need to have these things as being
[21:50] born again newborn babes and and then
[21:53] he'd bring it out and Paul would bring
[21:55] out the things and we went through it
[21:57] how Paul was bringing out the adoptions
[22:00] and the things in the Romans and all
[22:02] like that that was the writing of the
[22:05] word all right see we think well you
[22:10] know I'm sure that you're you've thought
[22:12] of it because none else I thought of it
[22:15] all right I'm human that we think about
[22:18] well there were good people
[22:23] those people prior to us were good
[22:26] people
[22:27] that gave their lives for the thing that
[22:32] they believed they gladly walked out and
[22:36] faced death for what they believed but
[22:42] yet these virtues was dying away because
[22:47] that was what was happening the
[22:48] cankerworm pond warm locusts in the
[22:50] caterpillar was taking away the Word of
[22:52] God it was not taken away the Holy
[22:55] Spirit those people still had the Holy
[22:58] Spirit living each day but it was taking
[23:01] away the word in the ages and coming
[23:05] down until it left the church to were
[23:08] not that they didn't have a good life I
[23:14] hope you follow that point those people
[23:19] from Calvary coming down they live good
[23:23] lives it's not necessarily the good life
[23:27] that went away so you could come along
[23:32] and say well well there's that no it's
[23:33] not this it's not just the life going
[23:36] away that they quit living a good life
[23:41] but around covers on Azusa Street and
[23:44] talking about the pea
[23:46] and they're dedicated nough stood and
[23:49] things happen he said they're closer to
[23:52] the Lord they were closer to the Lord
[23:53] than we are now that's a direct quote so
[23:59] you can't argue about the things that
[24:01] he's saying but yet you can argue the
[24:04] point in your mind of whether it's true
[24:07] or not look down through time and see
[24:09] the things to where those people were
[24:12] living great lives those of Zeus's
[24:15] Street people you know they were living
[24:20] great lives 1906 Azusa Street those were
[24:24] wonderful Christian people but yet
[24:29] brother Branham told them said there's
[24:32] where your problem is
[24:34] he said you're born into the family
[24:37] you've got the new birth but he said you
[24:41] stopped on that and said that's not the
[24:44] whole of all of it so then what would do
[24:48] in other words what was brother Branham
[24:50] wanting them to do you think about what
[24:53] him having to stand there and say that
[24:56] to people that were seeing the dead
[24:58] raised the sick heal the many
[25:00] manifestations through the Pentecostal
[25:03] movements and things and yet he says
[25:05] you're not following God's Word the way
[25:08] that he wants it you don't never think
[25:13] like that what would the man be talking
[25:15] about they were living great wonderful
[25:21] lives you can't say anything about their
[25:25] lives they make us ashamed of ourselves
[25:28] is that plain enough to put it we'll see
[25:34] that's the emphases I've made for the
[25:36] pipes few services I'm not trying to get
[25:40] you to live a better life that ought to
[25:45] be automatic
[25:47] that ought to be if we're Christian
[25:49] we're supposed to live a good life right
[25:54] and if we're a true Holy Ghost filled
[25:56] Christian we will but these virtues is
[25:59] not just a life to be given to make us a
[26:02] living a better life
[26:07] do you don't think about what was our
[26:11] purpose what died away what was the
[26:14] thing that that was in the disciples the
[26:18] brother Brennan said they had these
[26:20] virtues these qualities and then all at
[26:26] once you see the ages as it began to die
[26:28] away what begin to die away was the
[26:34] people living a Christian life know that
[26:37] never gardened that doesn't die away
[26:41] those people were living Christian lives
[26:46] what was dying away was the word that
[26:51] was what was eating away was the word
[26:55] all right the word was what was turned
[26:58] down they wanted brother on him with his
[27:02] gifts and all of his things they wanted
[27:04] all of those things but it was the word
[27:07] that was turned down so then it's a
[27:11] restoration of the word is to bring us
[27:13] restoration of the faith of the father's
[27:15] what is the faith of the father's it's
[27:18] the revelation are the life not just to
[27:21] live a good life but the life of Christ
[27:23] to live in us automatically and that we
[27:26] might follow the word of the hour that
[27:28] has been given unto us are you listening
[27:38] what do you think about when we talk
[27:40] about the faith of the father's and
[27:44] that's the emphasis I'm trying to make
[27:46] Peter was writing the word this is the
[27:51] writing of the word that was the faith
[27:53] of the father's they had that Holy Ghost
[27:57] filled faith in their life and
[28:00] capable of receiving from God and
[28:03] writing the actual word that we read
[28:10] Holy Ghost fell people to bring God's
[28:13] Word down to you and I I just live in a
[28:17] good life I know you'll take that and
[28:21] misunderstand it but I'm sorry I don't
[28:23] have the ability to explain it I just
[28:25] see it
[28:28] it wasn't living a good life that was
[28:31] lost in the ages those people had a good
[28:36] life they lived a life to make us
[28:40] ashamed of ourselves it was the word
[28:43] that was lost until we come out and we
[28:53] read as bad this method that's where you
[28:55] come from we read Peter and talked about
[28:59] we needed these things I didn't have to
[29:02] have brother branham to tell me that
[29:03] that the fruits of the spirit was love
[29:06] joy peace goodness meekness um and then
[29:08] coming out to temperance and patience
[29:10] and anything the Bible said that we
[29:14] talked of those things back there and
[29:19] there were good people there oh yes he
[29:24] the only thing you think about was the
[29:26] bad part but they were good people that
[29:30] they're still good people there there's
[29:32] good people right over here in this
[29:34] church there's good people all across
[29:35] the land of of the world that are in
[29:38] church today that are good people that
[29:41] the Prophet would call them Christians
[29:43] we call them unbelievers oh they don't
[29:46] believe this message who do you believe
[29:52] the message what is the message what is
[29:57] the message to you a good life they got
[30:01] us beat good works they got us beat what
[30:10] do you want to know
[30:11] the religious world has got us beat on
[30:14] those lungs what is the faith of the
[30:16] fathers
[30:20] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ for
[30:26] the time and that's what Peter was doing
[30:28] he was riding Christ into natural words
[30:33] to bring it unto us as to what we needed
[30:37] and he says with those of like as we're
[30:40] covering lies not those of like precious
[30:42] faith that was one of the questions what
[30:45] is like precious faith like precious
[30:47] faith is a same faith they had but to a
[30:53] born-again Christian you have a precious
[30:56] wonderful faith if you're just born
[30:59] again you have a precious wonderful
[31:01] faith but we need to like precious faith
[31:05] that the disciples had could God use you
[31:09] in how to write his word oh I know where
[31:14] that goes think oh that's where you flop
[31:15] on it but don't worry you're not
[31:18] flopping on me you're flopping on your
[31:19] own stupidity but see you turn around
[31:22] and say well we're not writing the word
[31:23] gibor cause you can't add to it nobody's
[31:27] talking about adding to the word it's
[31:31] the faith and the father's adding to the
[31:33] word or is that the word
[31:38] if Peter writing to us we look at it as
[31:44] he's writing to the Ephesians or writing
[31:46] to the Galatians or Paul writing to this
[31:48] one life oh I take it easy writing to me
[31:52] when I read the Bible I look at him what
[31:55] he was talking to me because I'm the one
[31:58] that's concerned in it when he said add
[32:01] to your faith virtue huh and says you've
[32:04] come now so far here and said you're
[32:06] doing wonderful you've come out you
[32:09] you're following the truth and you're
[32:11] getting away as you as as we've read
[32:13] over and over and over in in 1st Peter
[32:16] that we've come away from the things of
[32:19] the world and we've gathered into Jesus
[32:21] Christ
[32:24] well see is all that you're thinking
[32:27] about is is the faith of the fathers is
[32:31] just well we just need to get where we
[32:33] can live a better life I agree with you
[32:37] 100% but I still go with one thing
[32:41] living a good life is not the thing it's
[32:44] what causes you to live that life that's
[32:50] where we're dealing it's what's making
[32:53] us live that life we're supposed to live
[32:55] that life the Prophet didn't have to
[33:00] come and tell me that it was wrong to
[33:01] drink alcohol you know what I didn't
[33:08] drink it you didn't have to tell me I
[33:12] don't need to smoke I didn't smoke well
[33:18] you're just one of those weirdos well
[33:20] that's one thing about it if one weirdo
[33:22] can make it another weirdo can make it
[33:24] if you just get weirdo enough I've
[33:27] always believed a Christian life was a
[33:29] Christian life I've never thought it was
[33:32] alright to live in adultery and all kind
[33:35] of garbage cans and things like that
[33:37] I've told you before about it they had a
[33:39] story about a deacon in the church I was
[33:41] in and that Deacon was running around
[33:46] with a woman in the neighborhood but
[33:49] nobody could never prove it I wouldn't
[33:53] talk to him I was like 22 years old I'm
[33:58] maybe 23 24 and he was like 50 more than
[34:03] that I went to his house and talk to him
[34:06] I told him I said the story's out that
[34:10] you're running around what do you say he
[34:13] said I'll give you my word I said okay
[34:14] I'll take your word but I said the fun
[34:17] thing about it if I ever find out you're
[34:21] doing what they say I said I'll take you
[34:24] before the church and I said do you
[34:28] understand what I mean I mean I will
[34:31] physically take you before the church
[34:35] that's the way I live
[34:38] I'm in it my sister-in-law my sister
[34:44] told me in her hood was running around
[34:46] on her and said I wish he'd get out of
[34:47] the house I said give me a word I'll go
[34:49] throw him out
[34:49] I was just human enough that I believed
[34:52] in being right but I told that Deacon
[34:56] and he was well enough to be my daddy
[34:58] and everything yeah probably helped vote
[34:59] me in to be a deacon I told him I said
[35:03] I'll take you before the church if
[35:04] that's ever proved to be that away well
[35:07] I left before he got shot but that was
[35:16] between him and the man but you know I
[35:19] wasn't there but get the point of what
[35:22] I'm talking about
[35:23] I've always believed maybe never
[35:25] achieved yeah okay no problem never
[35:28] achieve my goal as to live a Christian
[35:31] life in Christ I wish I could say I had
[35:36] no but I'm a human being
[35:37] which there's one thing I've always had
[35:40] is a goal in my life to live for Christ
[35:43] to try to be what I could for the
[35:47] people's sake to where they could follow
[35:50] Christ into that line to failed right
[35:53] all right
[35:54] no problem it's just human what do you
[35:59] understand what I'm getting at see the
[36:01] statue of a perfect man is not a place
[36:03] to worth it here we are that we're not
[36:05] living too good we're not understanding
[36:07] some of the things as I've tried to
[36:09] illustrate did the Prophet have to tell
[36:11] you to quit drinking that the problem
[36:13] prophet has to tell you to quit cussing
[36:15] and lying and cheating and doing things
[36:17] like that that was supposed to been done
[36:20] as a Christian oh boy when I got to it I
[36:24] got rid of all of those times and I'm
[36:26] glad of it
[36:27] he now tell me that we were already
[36:33] making our children taking away certain
[36:36] programs on the TV for we ever heard of
[36:39] this message until then they couldn't
[36:44] watch this that in the other the Prophet
[36:47] didn't have to come to tell us a lot of
[36:49] things fault
[36:50] we think that all brother
[36:51] come to do was tell her we wasn't
[36:53] supposed to cut her higher paint her
[36:54] face or men to wear long hair does that
[36:58] that was supposed to be done in
[37:00] Christianity oh boy I heard the Prophet
[37:06] when he told me that I wasn't supposed
[37:08] to lie no more I quit lying if you'd
[37:11] been born again before then you would
[37:13] have no problem about line Oh we'll see
[37:19] that's what gets rough that's where I
[37:20] bring it out like it really is and I
[37:23] don't play or play around with it
[37:25] that's the way it is we were supposed to
[37:27] be Christians before we ever heard of
[37:30] this message if we claim to be Christian
[37:32] before then the life of Christ is
[37:35] automatically to be brought within us to
[37:38] take away these things see just because
[37:43] I'm get this and then we'll move on in
[37:45] the message just because that we think
[37:47] we think that the stature of perfect man
[37:49] is to bring us to being better
[37:50] Christians I'm not trying to make that
[37:53] goal of all we're supposed to already be
[37:56] Christians they were supposed to be
[37:58] settled by the new birds that you
[38:00] receive wherever you receive an A for
[38:02] you heard of the message I have you
[38:04] heard of it or what that's supposed to
[38:09] mean settled on the message was to bring
[38:13] us the word that's what I'm trying to
[38:19] get you to see there Peter was writing
[38:21] the word these people had these virtues
[38:24] you want to know what to fight for the
[38:25] father did with people that had the
[38:27] ability to hear God's Word brought down
[38:30] and to them and brought into their being
[38:33] that they could appreciate out large you
[38:37] faith of the Father that's not just a
[38:39] living good and being good and going to
[38:40] church
[38:50] it was the fact that the word had been
[38:54] eaten away we could still read it he
[38:59] didn't eat it off the pages we could
[39:05] read it and that's what I do it I read
[39:09] it I used to have a better now but I had
[39:13] a good memory of the Bible because I
[39:16] read it constantly I got a decent memory
[39:21] of the Mexico that's what I've done is
[39:23] read and heard it one because I believe
[39:26] it I believe this message is the
[39:29] restoration of God's Word brought to us
[39:33] by the prophet of God in this end time
[39:39] God brought his message to his prophet
[39:44] right we're not looking for another
[39:47] we're talking about it so no yesterday
[39:49] not looking for another messenger to
[39:52] come they asked me a question about what
[39:56] do you think about there I said there's
[39:57] no such thing it's another prophet to
[39:59] come to the Gentile dispensation you
[40:04] said well brother sunchokes but that's
[40:06] between brother so it's on God you give
[40:09] me the Bible foreign you give me the
[40:11] prophets message for it I don't want you
[40:15] around to your opinion or thoughts well
[40:18] what do you think a brother so-and-so
[40:19] that's between brother so-and-so in God
[40:22] that's none of our business that's
[40:24] between them him and God or them in God
[40:28] but there's not to be another messenger
[40:31] to come you can't put it in there you
[40:33] have an eighth messenger and you do away
[40:35] with the prophets message because he was
[40:37] the eighth messenger so people don't
[40:40] even know the message no brother he was
[40:43] the seventh messenger you sure our
[40:45] carnal in your understanding that was
[40:48] what was restored to us was the word the
[40:54] word is what was to be brought by the to
[40:56] us by the prophet of the end time and
[40:59] all I've ever tried to do is just say
[41:01] one
[41:01] let's keep the line up right I've never
[41:05] looked for another messenger to come or
[41:08] somebody to come along and interpret
[41:11] this message to us hmm
[41:13] now I appreciate appreciate the way they
[41:18] preached it
[41:18] there's the interpretation you want to
[41:21] know what the interpretation of 1st and
[41:24] 2nd Peter is it's written on - it's the
[41:32] revelation that was given to Peter -
[41:35] right
[41:36] of what would had happen in his own life
[41:39] and where he had come to and how he was
[41:43] trying to tell us how to come to that
[41:45] place
[41:46] darzee faith to the Father there's your
[41:49] revelation of Jesus Christ
[41:53] there's the Word of God to be revealed
[41:55] to us we don't have to have somebody to
[42:00] to come along now and then try to
[42:02] interpret I've never talked nothing like
[42:03] it the Prophet brought the message if
[42:07] there was any interpreting to be done it
[42:09] would be brought in that stage I like
[42:14] what he said it was interpretation in
[42:18] his own life Peter was bringing the
[42:22] interpretation that was in his own life
[42:25] when he was writing first Peter and
[42:29] second Peter that was the revelation of
[42:31] Jesus Christ in his life
[42:34] there's the faith of the father's the
[42:40] Prophet come to restore us back to that
[42:41] and then God used him to bring things
[42:44] right went on into what was in his life
[42:50] but he had to have the faith it was in
[42:52] those disciples lives brought into his
[42:55] life first and that's why I've always
[42:58] told you I've taught this from the
[43:00] beginning we've had a prophet he brought
[43:03] the message this messenger Malachi for
[43:08] Luke 17 they're gonna do to think what
[43:10] turned the hearts of the children back
[43:11] to the faith of the fathers 327 church
[43:13] age book right
[43:15] and to tell us about those seven
[43:18] thunders which is a revelation contained
[43:19] in the seven seals and to be these
[43:21] divinely revealed mystery proves that
[43:23] literally turn our hearts back
[43:25] that's the message all right that is to
[43:31] literally then wants to happen see
[43:33] that's what I've said you won't go on
[43:35] with the rest of it you'll go was so far
[43:38] and stop because he then the prophet and
[43:42] the Bible said the fivefold ministry
[43:44] were for the perfecting of the science
[43:46] and brother Branham in the statue of a
[43:49] perfect man said that the fivefold
[43:51] ministry would break this thing down are
[43:53] praying it to the people so hard get it
[43:58] in the right order we got to profit in
[44:00] this message we're not looking for
[44:02] another messenger to come we're not
[44:05] looking for a five fold ministry prophet
[44:08] to raise up that's what people are doing
[44:14] now they may they may try to bring some
[44:16] other prophets if you say something
[44:18] they'll put it in the FIFO you know they
[44:20] move around there they won't spend our
[44:22] steal and say this is what I believe
[44:24] well but I tell you what I believe
[44:26] I believe there ain't no such thing as
[44:30] an addition to the fivefold ministry but
[44:33] a random was brought outside of that
[44:35] because he was the word of he was the
[44:37] one to bring the Word of God his message
[44:40] was outside of the fivefold ministry
[44:42] that's why we must have answer back to
[44:45] that message we don't have a message of
[44:48] her own I've taught you that
[44:49] the fivefold ministry carries his
[44:51] message not if they're supposed to find
[44:55] something their sale we're not in the
[44:57] writing of the word the disciples wrote
[44:59] the word there's not an addition to
[45:04] writing the Word of God even brother
[45:07] Branham bringing those seals in thought
[45:09] that was not an addition to the Bible it
[45:11] was spoke of in the Bible well nobody
[45:16] yet nobody hadn't spoke on it sure it
[45:18] was covered up but it wasn't in an
[45:22] edition if you make it an Edition you
[45:25] make him a false prophet now that's what
[45:27] he said
[45:29] see do we believe it what you see Church
[45:34] trying to get us to look at it the way
[45:36] that it's supposed to be the disciples
[45:41] brought us the Word of God from God
[45:44] through the disciples brother Branham
[45:47] didn't come and correct Peter he didn't
[45:50] come to correct power he didn't come to
[45:53] correct any of the ones writing the word
[45:56] he come to correct you and me from our
[46:00] thinking of what we had or what they we
[46:03] thought they say it he didn't do it that
[46:08] way he come to bring us or restore the
[46:11] word because there's the faith of the
[46:13] fathers the revelation of the fathers
[46:15] I mean he'd stayed at one he said how
[46:19] many gods did Israel have they said they
[46:24] only had one said how many God citizen
[46:28] disciple that they only had one he said
[46:30] how many gods do we have well see we're
[46:34] supposed to just be have one God who the
[46:36] same as rest of them all right but see
[46:40] the face of the father's is the written
[46:43] word of God are you following us all the
[46:52] written word of God was written by the
[46:55] Apostles Paul Peter James John the ones
[47:02] that were writing the word that they got
[47:06] God's Word and put it in the letter for
[47:09] him for you and I we'll see we like to
[47:13] read the Bible but we read it as God
[47:15] talking to somebody else know you'll
[47:18] never understand the Bible if you think
[47:20] keep it in that line of trying to fit
[47:22] for somebody else you got to get it for
[47:24] yourself
[47:25] you got to get it is talking to you
[47:27] behold I send you Elijah the Prophet is
[47:36] that to what the scripture said it was
[47:40] sent to you and I the message was
[47:43] brought to you and I there's no need to
[47:46] try to find another message you can't
[47:48] fit it in it won't go
[47:49] I've had people to talk about well what
[47:52] about a five fold ministry prophet five
[47:54] whole ministry probably ain't no
[47:55] different in the bringing the Word of
[47:56] God than an apostle is matter of fact I
[48:00] can get stricter with you
[48:03] you don't listen to brother Branham
[48:06] brother Brown said there was no none of
[48:09] them that could touch the teacher out of
[48:12] the five fold ministry now that's his
[48:16] word so you do what you want to but see
[48:19] I say it this away the teacher ain't no
[48:23] different nobody else it's not if the
[48:25] word come to the teacher only and then
[48:27] he brings it to the rest of the ministry
[48:29] God reveals himself to a five fold
[48:32] ministry it reveals itself to the five
[48:38] fold ministry and it come by way of the
[48:42] prophets message that was delivered unto
[48:45] us you want to know what the Prophet
[48:49] says read it a simple one what was the
[48:56] faith of the father's brother Dale maybe
[48:58] you've got that any question in your
[48:59] mind why don't you just open your book
[49:01] why don't you just open the Bible why
[49:03] don't you just start reading in the book
[49:05] of Acts folks will be written about Luke
[49:11] and he wouldn't even want to original
[49:14] examples but he got it later and wrote
[49:15] it and the book of Acts was supposed to
[49:17] be written by Luke and then you come on
[49:19] over from there and you get Peter Paul
[49:23] James John you want to know what the
[49:29] faith of the fathers did read the Bible
[49:34] it's simple to make read your Bible
[49:38] well what was the revelation they had
[49:40] read it see because that's what we need
[49:46] I hope you follow me and don't go off on
[49:49] the wrong end of the deal with it I
[49:50] believe in living a Christian life I
[49:53] preached that to you from day one I
[49:55] believe in living a Christian life
[49:57] I don't believe we had to have run
[50:00] around and to come and tell us wrong it
[50:02] was to cut ha it was wrong few women to
[50:03] cut higher you can read the Word of God
[50:05] he didn't have to tell us it's wrong for
[50:08] the women to plank your faith are the
[50:09] men to have long higher and all was ever
[50:12] done he didn't have to tell us that the
[50:13] word said it we were just using the
[50:18] excuse it we didn't understand it till
[50:20] the Prophet came well I'm glad to
[50:26] probably come straighten those things
[50:27] out what did he have to straighten out
[50:31] the Bible tells you not to do them time
[50:37] right the Christian life is a Christian
[50:41] live live the life of Christ living
[50:43] where he comes and lives through you and
[50:47] manifest himself through you but see the
[50:54] revelation of God's Word coming to
[50:57] mankind was bother disciples if you're
[51:01] following me they brought us the word
[51:04] that was the faith of the fathers we
[51:09] don't have to house somebody to
[51:11] interpret that it says it and means it
[51:13] the Prophet come to bring it down into
[51:18] understanding humanly and what was
[51:22] really his understanding done to us was
[51:25] that the Bible was God in letter form
[51:33] what Bill I believe it if it said so and
[51:36] so you already condemned your own self
[51:39] if you say you'd believe it if it said
[51:41] something else
[51:41] you've just condemned your own self come
[51:46] on because you're admitting it's right
[51:50] let's see they come to write the word
[51:53] that's the faith of the fathers is the
[51:56] writing of the word they brought God's
[51:58] Word down to mankind
[52:00] alright Satan took over their nage is an
[52:04] ADA way that understanding there were
[52:08] some people down through those ages and
[52:10] things that understood things but it was
[52:15] eaten away you lost the one God you lost
[52:18] the water baptism you lost the pre
[52:19] destinations you lost all of those
[52:21] things the Prophet had to come not to
[52:25] bring us a different Bible but to take
[52:27] this Bible and show that those disciples
[52:30] believed that these a lot of people
[52:35] think brother Branham I added something
[52:37] when he had a Serpent's eat you ain't
[52:39] read your Bible Paul understood serpent
[52:42] seed you want to stay about three or
[52:45] four days on that get into the book of
[52:47] Romans get into those things Ephesians
[52:49] and on you'll find out he understood a
[52:51] lot of things and he put it down into
[52:54] the letter form
[52:56] he understood predestination he brought
[52:59] it into correct order
[53:02] he didn't have to have brother Branham
[53:04] to come straight and Paul out he was
[53:08] right brother Branham took Paul's letter
[53:11] to bring it to us the word to bring to
[53:16] you and I so we could follow the word
[53:23] this is the hour of the understanding of
[53:26] those things not to rewriting of the
[53:31] book you're gonna try to add to you
[53:37] don't add to the word the seals wasn't
[53:41] not in addition to the word they was
[53:43] already spoke of in the word now to
[53:46] bring it down to give us understanding
[53:48] of it yes we needed that yes but it was
[53:51] already in the word it was written there
[53:55] when brother Brandon went out dirt and
[53:57] Tucson and come back did he start over
[54:00] said let me rewrite this now with we're
[54:02] okay
[54:03] chapter one and
[54:03] two of Revelations and three but said
[54:06] now when we get heretofore we're getting
[54:08] a little heavily you know into and then
[54:11] when we get to six let's rewrite this
[54:14] was already written in the word it was
[54:20] already written in the word it didn't
[54:27] have to be rewritten
[54:28] it had to be understood but you see
[54:37] Church then that comes down to that
[54:38] basis because this is the point they all
[54:41] drunk now and fall over half of the
[54:43] message into where we're going we talked
[54:47] about the virtues in the things and I
[54:53] want you to remember one thing I've said
[54:55] it about two or three times so far the
[54:58] virtues our Holy Ghost given virtues
[55:00] they are not nature given virtues
[55:06] they're not just given because of a
[55:08] natural nature of life and you're a good
[55:10] person whatever that's not what it is
[55:13] it's holy ghost' virtues it's Holy Ghost
[55:17] faith Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost
[55:19] temporize and now remember one time
[55:22] because the I've seen it here and seeing
[55:25] people argue the point here to think
[55:26] about it
[55:27] you cannot start at faith and jump up to
[55:31] brotherly kindness well I don't need
[55:34] these things in between I've what
[55:35] brother the kindness and I'll get next
[55:36] to the headstone I'll turn it upside
[55:38] down out yeah you turned it upside down
[55:39] alright you came add knowledge to faith
[55:51] you add virtue really if virtue is not
[55:56] added to faith virtue is faith in
[55:58] manifestation are you listening to that
[56:04] virtue is actually not a virgin life
[56:07] it's a virtuous life it's a life lived
[56:12] by the Word of God to show us how
[56:15] wonderful God is
[56:17] but it's got to be added to your faith
[56:19] you can't add knowledge to your faith
[56:23] well I said this when I don't think that
[56:25] that see that's where you're going wrong
[56:27] you can't do it but just remember each
[56:33] one of these virtues is the same
[56:34] material no matter what we think of
[56:39] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[56:41] patience godliness right it's the same
[56:43] material because remember the Prophet
[56:46] emphasized it blaspheme his name and the
[56:48] statue of a perfect man that these these
[56:51] virtues have to be vulcanized together
[56:55] and yet you cannot vulcanize a piece of
[56:59] iron and a piece of rubber you don't do
[57:03] that it's got to be the same material so
[57:08] what is faith it's the new birth it's
[57:12] the revelation of Jesus Christ what is
[57:14] virtue it's adding more to the birth not
[57:21] in the birth of adding more to it to try
[57:23] to make it anything different it's
[57:24] bringing forth the birth into a virtuous
[57:27] life because you can't add virtue until
[57:33] you first get faith it's no good it's
[57:38] just a good life it is just a natural
[57:42] given nature life if you're a good
[57:44] person in that which you've got our
[57:47] faith in first to be born again all
[57:49] right then you can add virtue but don't
[57:54] you say no I'm very I'm just going to
[57:56] add knowledge and then after I get my
[57:58] knowledge and I'll pick up a little
[57:59] further and get this over here it'll
[58:00] help me bring up this back here no no no
[58:03] no no no it won't help you bring it up
[58:10] you got to add it to it it's got to be
[58:13] added one to the other coming up and
[58:16] it's got to be vulcanized together as
[58:19] it's brought so when faith he's brought
[58:24] forth right the Newburg see then you can
[58:30] start
[58:31] talking about virtue or a virtuous
[58:32] Christian or Christ coming and living in
[58:35] you know how does that not enough don't
[58:39] don't do that it won't work I'm trying
[58:42] to tell you it won't work how do you
[58:44] know who called Peter didn't say it if
[58:48] it to work Peter said it that way but he
[58:51] said add to your faith virtue right
[58:55] they don't say then hadn't pitch them it
[59:00] won't come forth he said you had
[59:03] knowledge see you've gotta add virtue
[59:13] and then add knowledge because you would
[59:16] not be able to handle the knowledge if
[59:18] you didn't come forward with a virtue
[59:19] first first is number one you've got to
[59:22] be born again second comes to virtue a
[59:26] virtuous life or a life lived in Christ
[59:29] or things like that and not just natural
[59:31] things so you've got to have that to be
[59:34] able to understand I don't have to have
[59:36] that to understand I just read well why
[59:39] didn't you get it for the profit gain
[59:43] why are we not following you instead of
[59:47] this end time prophet are you getting it
[59:50] I don't mind being that Stern if you
[59:53] think you got it we're supposed to be
[59:54] following you let's see if we lay
[1:00:01] everything down and follow God's plan
[1:00:03] but that's where I say you won't do it
[1:00:07] because what I said want to go the
[1:00:10] Prophet brought the message how does how
[1:00:12] can them how can the church come to
[1:00:15] perfection
[1:00:16] can't do it without the fivefold
[1:00:17] ministry why cause the Bible said it
[1:00:20] because the Prophet said because that
[1:00:23] solves the problem we aren't on fire I
[1:00:26] get myself why didn't you get it before
[1:00:29] the Prophet came here but I don't need
[1:00:33] it now cuz the Prophet wrote it that's a
[1:00:37] life to the Satan Cetner just on your
[1:00:40] shoulder life and not crazy at you you
[1:00:43] can't do it it's
[1:00:44] to be revealed that's why I spent so
[1:00:48] much emphasis in time and the Prophet
[1:00:50] did he spent his time dwelling on the
[1:00:53] statue of a perfect man about how you
[1:00:55] needed to be born again he kept laying
[1:00:58] the inverses you need to be born again
[1:01:01] you got to have the faith the faith that
[1:01:04] the Apostles had you got to come to that
[1:01:10] new birth because without the new birth
[1:01:15] your your virtue won't be nothing but
[1:01:18] just a man-made virtue and all of the
[1:01:20] bids you'll say then well I well I teach
[1:01:23] I'm virtuous because I'm gonna virgin
[1:01:25] well I live I live a good life huh I
[1:01:28] must be a Christian ain't gonna do it
[1:01:31] it's whether or not she's born again
[1:01:33] were you a Christian or not oh you don't
[1:01:36] believe in being good no I don't believe
[1:01:38] in being good and never have to out you
[1:01:39] need to be good I've always taught you
[1:01:41] need to be born again
[1:01:42] that's one only thing that will ever
[1:01:44] make us good of any form is to get the
[1:01:46] new birth it's not good just because we
[1:01:50] go to church because we do our thing we
[1:01:52] pay our tithes we run we do all of these
[1:01:54] things we try to help them do that oh
[1:01:56] yeah
[1:01:58] but that ain't it it's whether or not
[1:02:03] we're born again whether or not we have
[1:02:06] the life of Christ living in us and see
[1:02:09] only with the life of Christ in us can
[1:02:10] we talk about virtue because if not
[1:02:13] we'll talk about virtue as some kind of
[1:02:14] something we can do or not do it's
[1:02:21] commendable to do or not do that's
[1:02:24] wonderful to do or not do but that don't
[1:02:27] make you a Christian if it's an outward
[1:02:30] affect of what end would work in
[1:02:32] wonderful shape what you see that's why
[1:02:39] the Prophet would cover it why would he
[1:02:42] not go with the natural words of virtue
[1:02:44] as to leaning back to mort's like
[1:02:47] something you could do he never went to
[1:02:49] that line
[1:02:50] he emphasized it he said not in this
[1:02:52] case he said it's not to just live a
[1:02:57] virgin life in the
[1:02:58] case we're talking about he had
[1:03:00] something else in mind he was going back
[1:03:02] into Peters understanding because the
[1:03:06] natural man would take Peters
[1:03:07] understanding and bring it to a natural
[1:03:10] works of something what I didn't I did
[1:03:13] I'm a virgin
[1:03:14] well praise God that's a wonderful thing
[1:03:17] but that don't mean you're born again
[1:03:27] come on church you said well I don't cut
[1:03:32] my hair and I don't do that you can have
[1:03:34] you can have higher drag in your tracks
[1:03:36] out then they one bit of the salvation
[1:03:39] in it if it's not something that took
[1:03:41] place in your heart because in my day a
[1:03:48] long time ago but in my day there was no
[1:03:53] short hair girls that were prostitutes
[1:03:55] they were all long-haired girls because
[1:03:58] they knew what to hire men that it was
[1:04:01] something feminists I don't mind talking
[1:04:07] plain I am playing that's where you'll
[1:04:11] never accuse this boy of not being
[1:04:12] straight and playing you know I just
[1:04:14] can't understand brother Dale you're not
[1:04:16] listening to reading you don't
[1:04:17] understand
[1:04:18] listen to what said because I'm trying
[1:04:22] my best to make it as plain as I can but
[1:04:27] see we said what other study the message
[1:04:30] and I'll get knowledge that's the head
[1:04:31] knowledge that's hip knowledge wonderful
[1:04:37] don't lose it right don't lose it when I
[1:04:43] say I read six books in one day and
[1:04:45] listen to two tapes I'm not bragging to
[1:04:48] the point of trying to make it simpler
[1:04:50] I'm telling the truth I done it but you
[1:04:52] know what that never turned my soul and
[1:04:56] whatsoever unless it was what was on
[1:04:58] those pages was revealed to me
[1:05:07] those we tried to approach for just a
[1:05:10] minute of talking about knowledge just
[1:05:14] remember it's not worldly knowledge it's
[1:05:17] not head knowledge that the Prophet is
[1:05:19] talking about it's not head knowledge
[1:05:22] that Peter is talking about it's not how
[1:05:26] much you can know or learn or whatever
[1:05:28] it could be it's like brother Moulton in
[1:05:32] with a man that he could quote but I
[1:05:35] forgot how much it was with the Bible
[1:05:36] but it was a large amount of the Bible
[1:05:39] and they were discussing one guard with
[1:05:40] him and he could just quote they were
[1:05:43] brother George and brother mopin him too
[1:05:44] he could just quote like that and this
[1:05:46] quote the Bible this because of his
[1:05:47] memory but after a while when he faced
[1:05:53] somebody had a little understanding
[1:05:55] he wouldn't even pronounce the name of
[1:05:57] Jesus they brought him to the wall to
[1:06:02] the point that he wouldn't even
[1:06:03] pronounce and he'd say literally the
[1:06:04] Valley Rose Sheriff and they kept him so
[1:06:07] why don't you call his name because he
[1:06:13] knew he was in the wrong place he knew
[1:06:18] he was in a place that his head
[1:06:19] knowledge didn't do no good and
[1:06:22] knowledge is wonderful great we need it
[1:06:25] and only the only way you can ever have
[1:06:28] a revelation is for God to bring it into
[1:06:30] your head first they don't come into
[1:06:33] your heart first it comes into your head
[1:06:35] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:06:38] the Word of God it comes true your sense
[1:06:41] is down into there then it can be
[1:06:43] revealed until then it's just head
[1:06:48] knowledge the come on if virtue was not
[1:06:53] just to live a virgin life how much more
[1:06:57] is it for knowledge but I know it won't
[1:07:01] finish this because I'll finish it this
[1:07:02] afternoon but knowledge knowledge
[1:07:10] what's the difference in head knowledge
[1:07:11] and Holy Ghost knowledge you can walk on
[1:07:17] the Holy Ghost knowledge but you'll
[1:07:22] never do it on head knowledge knowledge
[1:07:29] what is knowledge to know that the Bible
[1:07:35] is not contradictory now what do you
[1:07:44] think about contradictions in the word
[1:07:51] do you think there's any contradictions
[1:07:53] in the Bible now come on I mean okay
[1:08:01] don't raise your hand don't do too much
[1:08:04] with me because you get in trouble your
[1:08:05] own self do you think there's any
[1:08:08] contradictions in the Bible
[1:08:10] you think there's any contradictions in
[1:08:13] this message then why is a 1900 or
[1:08:17] something denominations maybe more than
[1:08:21] that thousands as we go back to the 969
[1:08:23] the Prophet used to use originally weird
[1:08:31] all them come from from head knowledge
[1:08:38] and all of them thought they were
[1:08:40] contradiction between this and that yes
[1:08:43] then you said no they never taught it
[1:08:50] like that
[1:08:50] they taught a Trinity and they said the
[1:08:54] Bible was not correct that it was really
[1:08:57] a Trinity well that's it they said then
[1:09:00] it's got a contradiction in it right
[1:09:03] right you can't okay that you don't get
[1:09:08] in trouble by okay and the truth that I
[1:09:10] say see they said well oh no there's no
[1:09:16] contradictions but they just might one
[1:09:23] right they just made a contradiction out
[1:09:28] of whether there was one daughter 3
[1:09:32] there is no contradictions but they just
[1:09:35] made a contradiction
[1:09:36] now listen every one of them did only
[1:09:43] this end time prophet had the
[1:09:45] understanding of the one garden
[1:09:46] correctly so you know what that means
[1:09:49] 969 Evelyn had contradictions right I
[1:09:56] couldn't understand that I had trouble
[1:09:58] when I was in the Baptist Church with
[1:10:00] that point I couldn't understand why
[1:10:02] there were so many different churches
[1:10:04] out of one Bible you didn't ever think
[1:10:10] like that how that they could be 969
[1:10:13] different understandings of one Bible
[1:10:16] well you know what that means somebody's
[1:10:19] wrong somewhere so that means if you're
[1:10:24] right then there's 968 wrong
[1:10:28] interpretations because you got to deny
[1:10:32] them is that what you're saying see now
[1:10:39] they were wrong right because they had
[1:10:42] contradictions out of the same Bible
[1:10:47] they had contradiction now what about
[1:10:52] this message in time people oh no
[1:10:57] brother you know yourself you heard
[1:11:00] ministers stand up and proclaim and
[1:11:03] Swire by the Word of God that there's
[1:11:06] not a contradiction in this message but
[1:11:10] where are they today they're the ones
[1:11:14] today that are turning the message to
[1:11:16] pieces saying brother Brown was wrong
[1:11:22] here and run around wrong here I've run
[1:11:24] down this is that this dates not right
[1:11:26] here this listen and they're getting
[1:11:31] their goal I've told you over and over
[1:11:34] we face the dock
[1:11:36] turns of the date of the being wrong
[1:11:39] after our brother branham was hunting
[1:11:41] and all that that was 1970 we had
[1:11:44] ministers meeting on those things in
[1:11:46] 1970 that's not a new thing we had
[1:11:51] meetings about it then but you know what
[1:11:53] you had then you had a lot of old people
[1:11:57] that had the true experience of the Holy
[1:12:00] Ghost in their hearts and lives a lot of
[1:12:05] them come from Azusa Street a lot of
[1:12:08] them had that experience of Azusa Street
[1:12:10] coming into the message and they wish
[1:12:14] stood those doctrines and they could not
[1:12:16] get an inroad into the people they come
[1:12:22] on Church some of you ain't never been
[1:12:23] around but I've heard seven thunder
[1:12:26] virtues and things like that preached so
[1:12:28] much until it's a mess too worth it
[1:12:31] they seven boned one was a chiropractor
[1:12:33] and he had seven bones in the neck and
[1:12:35] that was the seven bones that meant the
[1:12:38] seven thunders or the seven seals and
[1:12:41] there's that in the other you know how
[1:12:42] two bones in your neck and one of them
[1:12:44] had Henry Aaron sitting over here and
[1:12:46] knocking as a grand slam home run to
[1:12:49] bring everybody else home because he was
[1:12:51] at number seven but to see people
[1:12:57] withstood those things and they were not
[1:13:00] able to carry on very far but today
[1:13:07] they're not carrying it on they're
[1:13:13] actually sitting in wondering if these
[1:13:15] people are right or wrong they can't
[1:13:20] stand up and say I've got the experience
[1:13:21] I don't care what to say he said well
[1:13:26] that brother so-and-so he's got all kind
[1:13:27] of signs and wonderful praise God
[1:13:29] the Pope prays for the sick and there
[1:13:31] he'll praise God anybody's ever he'll
[1:13:35] praise God God done it no man can thank
[1:13:38] God for the healing
[1:13:41] but the person that comes through might
[1:13:43] be our folks right to see we get into
[1:13:52] the one great thing of knowledge
[1:13:54] the Bible says knowledge puffeth up it's
[1:14:00] the only thing knowledge you'll ever do
[1:14:01] for your head knowledge they'll just run
[1:14:03] you up but Holy Ghost knowledge we carry
[1:14:08] you to your knees you had never wondered
[1:14:15] I'll give you this now quit you have
[1:14:18] never been wondering about things you
[1:14:21] know about doctrines or ideas and things
[1:14:24] and you were really concerned because
[1:14:28] you wanted to be right you know you
[1:14:31] wanted to be saved and be riding like
[1:14:34] well yet right in the middle of all of
[1:14:36] that you beginning to wonder who's right
[1:14:39] and what's right you know and all it
[1:14:43] wants something that speaks to you and
[1:14:50] says none of that's right and here's
[1:14:53] what's right see then you're not worried
[1:15:00] about who's right and who's wrong
[1:15:01] because God done told you what's right
[1:15:04] his words right let people are getting
[1:15:12] fuss about it we ain't worried about it
[1:15:13] that's what we were talking about last
[1:15:15] night in the in the fellowship you know
[1:15:17] the Bible study we're talking about
[1:15:19] things that you know you can just argue
[1:15:22] about you know you can argue over this
[1:15:25] and I'm natural things you can argue
[1:15:27] over this and argue over that and you
[1:15:29] got your point the world is round then
[1:15:34] these other people come up with the
[1:15:35] world is flat well what does it matter
[1:15:38] which way it is well it's gotta be round
[1:15:49] well why did you profit come up what
[1:15:52] happened safe
[1:15:53] that they just figured out this four
[1:15:55] points to their be I can know how to
[1:15:59] quote run around said days four points
[1:16:02] to the earth
[1:16:05] no he believed it was round that's what
[1:16:10] I'm getting that's what we're talking
[1:16:11] about life not we spent about 30 45
[1:16:13] minutes talking about it because that
[1:16:16] was the point you spend all your time
[1:16:18] talking about where the world was flat
[1:16:19] or round what does it matter which way
[1:16:22] it is is it going to save you if you
[1:16:28] ride by order is flat around they told
[1:16:33] us that the moon was cheese and they was
[1:16:38] a rat up there and you could see the
[1:16:39] holes where he went through the moon
[1:16:46] that's silly that's what I'm saying we
[1:16:50] can be plum silly about what we're doing
[1:16:52] we can sit down and argue over
[1:16:55] situations or thoughts and that's what
[1:17:00] the people are doing today they're
[1:17:01] arguing over the message of this that or
[1:17:04] the other what does it matter if it's
[1:17:07] right or wrong but a random said one day
[1:17:13] he said to black and white or fight
[1:17:15] again one day and die like flies so you
[1:17:19] go around the world and print that and
[1:17:21] that's what they've done they just
[1:17:22] didn't go to the met next message
[1:17:25] the next message he said that was my
[1:17:29] idea that was not God take over $5 lakhs
[1:17:38] look at him down over here look at him
[1:17:39] down over there down out your this piece
[1:17:41] got over there you see that's what we've
[1:17:47] done we've made all of these things an
[1:17:50] argument instead of it making the life
[1:17:54] of Christ knowledge is what's done it
[1:18:00] we'll take that up this even come on
[1:18:02] musician will pick that point up this
[1:18:05] evening to continue the thought
[1:18:07] knowledge knowledge will destroy us
[1:18:16] revelation will save us which one is it
[1:18:25] well I'm just gonna say what the prophet
[1:18:28] said well what about this other one over
[1:18:30] here that's saying when two prophets a
[1:18:33] right could you give me anything I'm as
[1:18:37] honest inconvenient I've never been you
[1:18:39] know I'm not smarter than but you give
[1:18:41] me any quote from brother Branham and
[1:18:43] give me a little bit of time and this
[1:18:45] old memory will run you through a quote
[1:18:47] that seems like it's contrary to that
[1:18:50] we've done that in the Bible before we
[1:18:55] heard of the Prophet the Bible said
[1:18:57] there's no Bible said that we don't know
[1:18:58] what to believe knowledge puffeth up but
[1:19:10] headstone knowledge will cut us off but
[1:19:17] remember you got to go all the way to
[1:19:19] the headstone to have full knowledge
[1:19:20] it's the only one of the virtues that
[1:19:24] we'll cover ever virtue ever virtue is
[1:19:28] covered by the word knowledge because
[1:19:31] virtue is a knowledge to you of Jesus
[1:19:36] Christ temperance patience godliness I'm
[1:19:46] trying my best to get to that one where
[1:19:47] brother Branham covers hidden Black's
[1:19:49] name is night he said you come all this
[1:19:51] way and said God didn't ever expect you
[1:19:55] to be perfect until now he says now he'd
[1:20:00] demand for you to be perfect well we
[1:20:05] don't know how you gonna be perfect with
[1:20:06] us mmm that's what I mean it's what I'm
[1:20:09] getting at let's stand together think on
[1:20:11] these things
[1:20:12] the disciples were writing the Bible
[1:20:18] so by them writing the Bible they could
[1:20:20] tell us the knowledge of God and it
[1:20:24] would be holy ghost knowledge and not
[1:20:27] our intellect what about it oh we got
