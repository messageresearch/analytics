[5:37] you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[5:38] turn what we've been reading in first
[5:41] Peter and we'll just read back up a
[5:44] little bit and use that in our thought
[5:46] today where we've been using first Peter
[5:49] for a long time but we'll just start
[5:53] with verse 13 you know remember now that
[5:56] the Lord willing after the evening
[5:59] service we'll be having a birthday party
[6:03] for sister Dale after the evening

[6:13] celebrating her 35th birthday
[6:16] she's just 35 today so that's huh
[6:20] it'd be hard to figure out how that
[6:22] we've been married 60 years but that's
[6:24] for you to figure it out okay so
[6:27] remember that there's praise the Lord
[6:29] would bless her she's having a lot of
[6:31] troubles going through all of these
[6:33] tests and things but praise the Lord
[6:35] would bring it all out and make
[6:36] everything work out to his

[6:52] destination may be today or whatever so
[6:55] Bret the Lord would would have give them

[7:13] your love and your grace father thank
[7:15] you that you have opened their eyes unto
[7:18] your word and we ask you to just guide
[7:22] us and let your light shine father into
[7:25] our our pathway that it would lighten up
[7:29] to where we can see how to walk because
[7:31] we must walk in you have your way
[7:34] forgive our sins bless God each one and
[7:37] or just bless these that are traveling
[7:39] different things and just have your way
[7:41] with everybody and let Lord your word
[7:45] come forth to manifest itself in this
[7:48] state because it's a promise and we
[7:50] believe you well that we thank you
[7:52] forgive our sins and guide us in Jesus
[7:55] name Amen
[8:01] we'll start with verse 13 through 23
[8:04] we've been using like 22 and 23 alright
[8:08] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[8:10] be sober and hope to the end for the
[8:13] grace that is to be brought unto you
[8:15] when at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[8:18] now that is this day this time 45
[8:24] Christ's mystery of God revealed at the
[8:26] revealing of the word alright as
[8:28] obedient children not fashioning
[8:31] yourselves according to the former lusts
[8:34] in your ignorance but as he which hath
[8:36] called us has called you is holy so be
[8:40] ye holy in all manner of conversation
[8:43] because it is written be holy for I am
[8:46] holy if you call on the father who
[8:49] without respect of persons judges
[8:52] according to
[8:53] every man's work pass the time of your
[8:55] sojourning here in the theater for as
[8:58] much as you know that you have not you
[9:01] were not redeemed with corruptible
[9:03] things as silver and gold from your vain
[9:05] conversation received by tradition from
[9:08] your father's but with the precious
[9:10] blood of Jesus Christ as of a lamb
[9:12] without blemish and without spot Hoover
[9:16] Li was foreordained before the
[9:18] foundation of the world but was
[9:20] manifested in these last times for you
[9:23] who by him do believe in God that raised
[9:27] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[9:30] that your faith in your hope might be in
[9:33] God seeing you have purified your souls
[9:36] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[9:38] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[9:41] that you love one another with a pure
[9:43] heart fervently being born again not a
[9:46] corruptible seed but of the of
[9:48] incorruptible by the Word of God which
[9:51] liveth and abideth forever you may be
[9:55] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[9:57] reading of the word I want to try to
[10:04] background some in all but you they've
[10:08] got your notes you notice you got the
[10:10] same notes that you had Sunday I mean
[10:13] Wednesday to where that you can just
[10:17] follow along in the reading but I want
[10:20] to us to think on something that I tried
[10:23] to express dark in the message first off
[10:29] do we believe the promises of God are
[10:32] yes amen that was our thought all right
[10:36] see if God promised something then it's
[10:41] not up to us to try to make that
[10:43] manifest it's up to him to make it
[10:46] manifest we just follow along go right
[10:49] along with it no but it's up to him if
[10:51] he said it so all we got to do is to
[10:55] find out if God said it all right then
[10:58] if he said it then we believe that he
[11:00] promised to do it it's always been the
[11:02] same down through there like the Bible
[11:04] says when the day of Pentecost was
[11:07] fully come what it promised it all right
[11:11] when it fully come then the Holy Ghost
[11:12] fail he promised it see then that's
[11:14] that's what we should be thinking about
[11:17] all right now to to see that and to find
[11:21] the day in that hour that we're living
[11:23] and the promise is for this time to
[11:27] where we're at to where we can follow in
[11:30] that line okay now we covered and have
[11:36] been covering for quite a while about
[11:38] the new birth and we had some lifes not
[11:41] on the points of the new birth the
[11:43] baptism of the holy ghost in the Bible
[11:46] study and I really enjoyed it if you
[11:48] want to get the tape and they can make
[11:50] you a copy and listen to it alright
[11:53] because we've been talking about for
[11:55] quite a while about the new birth being
[11:58] the birth of the word how does the
[12:01] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[12:05] you all right now it's not as we were
[12:09] covering last night see the baptism of
[12:12] the Holy Ghost even though it fell on a
[12:13] hundred and twenty in the upper room it
[12:15] was not collective forever how you
[12:18] called it as a group it was to each
[12:22] individual in the upper room each
[12:26] individual was receiving the baptism of
[12:29] the Holy Ghost
[12:30] the new birth the birth of the word that
[12:34] they had held for the three and a half
[12:36] years or whatever and each one was
[12:39] receiving it and it's not in a
[12:41] collective form God doesn't deal with us
[12:43] that away he deals with the Jews more
[12:46] into the line of a group of people are a
[12:50] nation or something but he deals with us
[12:52] Gentiles as individuals all right so
[12:57] then that way it wouldn't matter as I
[12:59] expressed it last night
[13:00] you had them accenting in the upper room
[13:02] 120 you have 80 70 80 here today sitting
[13:07] and the Holy Ghost could fall on each
[13:10] person here today and quicken some part
[13:15] of the word to each individual
[13:18] right right this here sitting here I
[13:22] mean he could do that all at one time
[13:23] it wouldn't be collective it would still
[13:26] be an individual afire
[13:28] all right so then when that day of
[13:31] Pentecost was fully come the Holy Ghost
[13:33] failed
[13:34] what because it was time but it fell on
[13:37] individuals to bring forth that new
[13:41] birth all right now thence we do we know
[13:46] that we talked about it I'm referring
[13:48] back to this past Wednesday that we
[13:50] talked about the the new birth what is
[13:53] it it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:56] all right what is the baptism of the
[13:58] Holy Ghost we see always this is that
[14:00] it's that what is the baptism of the
[14:02] Holy Ghost
[14:03] it's the revealing of God's Word it is
[14:07] the Spirit of God coming to you that
[14:11] have took the word and believed it and
[14:14] making that word alive
[14:17] so there's your baptism see we're
[14:19] looking for something to come out of the
[14:21] sky something to come out of this or
[14:23] some somewhere instead of looking at it
[14:25] as what it is and then realizing that
[14:31] the Holy Ghost is was saying was in each
[14:33] individual person in the upper room
[14:36] Mariah but it was the promise of the
[14:40] Holy Spirit being poured out upon
[14:44] mankind but it was revealing of God's
[14:48] Word and when the word it's made a lot
[14:50] they'll automatically be signs and
[14:52] wonders and and manifestations and and
[14:56] and you know feelings and and all kinds
[15:01] of things we'll go with that when it's
[15:04] the word being quickened unto you but we
[15:07] should look to the word being quickened
[15:09] first you know and then we go to the
[15:15] basis of whatever took place just like
[15:18] get the baby here right
[15:20] and many times get the baby here it's
[15:24] the birth all right then the baby cries
[15:29] see it does this
[15:32] that's the way we should be in Christ is
[15:35] let that word be made alive within us
[15:38] and then there'll be great
[15:42] manifestations father alright let's see
[15:46] I'll say this and then I'll get back to
[15:47] it in the message part I believe and
[15:51] they've talked is from the way back in
[15:53] the beginning I believe we're in the
[15:55] greatest revival that has ever been to
[15:59] the world right now well I just don't
[16:06] see it I'm going on see you say I still
[16:10] see them going on you're looking for
[16:13] something going on you're not looking
[16:15] the way I'm looking I've always looked
[16:18] at the revealing of God's Word what else
[16:24] could it be here stands a prophet here
[16:29] stands a prophet bring in the word and
[16:32] he said I've seen sick healed
[16:36] dead raised all kind of signs and
[16:39] wonders right well what did he say about
[16:42] the opening of the word of the seals he
[16:45] said this is the greatest realm that
[16:48] I've ever worked him well others don't
[16:53] that's way that that what was the woman
[16:56] preacher back there said at that time I
[16:57] some of you told me as he said it or
[16:59] sister so and so I won't go in the ninth
[17:01] but said under well I thought you know i
[17:04] I've never seen anything greater then
[17:06] what wrote around except in my own
[17:08] ministry you know because that's the way
[17:11] everybody thing see they wouldn't look
[17:13] in there was the Prophet bringing the
[17:15] Word of God from Almighty God himself
[17:18] the voice of God speaking to mankind but
[17:21] people were thinking ain't no revival I
[17:24] went down there and he was dead a
[17:26] doornail
[17:27] we're over here where we can shout and
[17:29] glory I have a good time
[17:30] in a revival just remember you're
[17:37] supposed to return this or believed it
[17:41] all the way down or revival is not for
[17:44] sinners
[17:45] or revile you can't revive a sinner
[17:49] revival is for those that are already in
[17:52] Christ alright so don't forget to
[17:55] thought now of what I'm trying to bring
[17:57] okay but see to me the baptism of the
[18:01] Holy Ghost the new birth and all it's
[18:03] one in the same because it's the word
[18:05] that's made alive and that's the thing
[18:08] that that has always held me to the
[18:11] basis of what I believe and worth it I
[18:13] believe it I believe the word has to be
[18:16] planted then the Spirit of God comes to
[18:19] make that word alive and what greater
[18:22] could it be then you have your signs and
[18:24] wonders and your manifestations and your
[18:27] things but get to the word first get to
[18:33] the word first because if you get to the
[18:35] word it'll bring these other things
[18:37] alright now as we've come up in our time
[18:42] and our thoughts of where we got up to
[18:44] the point that we're trying to deal with
[18:48] these virtues and talk about that a
[18:50] little bit of the stature of a perfect
[18:52] man and and the growth development in
[18:55] the things all right and as we've come
[18:57] to that place we know the Prophet said
[19:01] have faith and be born again alright and
[19:06] these things these virtues are the
[19:09] things that God expects us to bring
[19:15] forth or to make manifest he's the one
[19:19] that's going to bring a forth in G to
[19:20] you and I we can't do it anyway but you
[19:22] understand what I'm getting at alright
[19:24] we see we spoke about the virtues are to
[19:28] be added to the new birth but remember
[19:33] now faith I'm backing up over a lot of
[19:37] messages but trying to put it together
[19:39] and hold it Faith's the new birth is not
[19:44] an ad it's a birth excuse me it's the
[19:51] birth of the word alright faith
[19:56] revelation
[19:58] is a birth of the word alright I had
[20:05] this old coffin and it keeps hanging on
[20:08] and I'll keep giving it to the devil and
[20:10] he gives it back to the men and we have
[20:12] a fight over but that's all right all
[20:15] right but now what has been I thought
[20:17] got one in my mouth what has been our
[20:21] thoughts now have faith the Prophet said
[20:25] you supposed to have read the statue of
[20:27] perfect man and seen how many times he
[20:30] spoke of faith and what faith was and
[20:33] faith was the foundation of all
[20:35] Christianity because faith is the
[20:38] revealed Word of God the new birth is
[20:41] faith all right now then you add virtue
[20:45] to faith it doesn't say add faith it
[20:49] says you know in other words putting a
[20:52] prophet there how faith and be born
[20:54] again and then add because you can't add
[20:58] something that there's not something
[21:00] there for it to be added to so the birth
[21:02] is the birth of the word all right now
[21:05] see then you're standing there looking
[21:07] at it as the born-again experience of
[21:10] the same born-again experience that
[21:13] everybody has had everybody has the same
[21:16] new birth I mean these things when I
[21:19] start talking people just look at me
[21:23] everybody's had the same new birth what
[21:27] would be the problem with that no they
[21:30] shouted and we cried they think you're
[21:33] you're still on your manifestations
[21:35] you're still on your doing and then when
[21:38] I say baptism with the Holy Spirit
[21:39] you're looking for something from up in
[21:41] heaven to come down some kind of a
[21:45] manifestations as I remember that's
[21:48] after the birth if we get that settled
[21:53] then we can go on through the message
[21:55] and talk about these virtues in time all
[21:58] right
[21:59] now we come as I said to the point that
[22:01] we're talking about we must have these
[22:04] virtues we'll get to it at the end of
[22:06] the message the Lord with it that
[22:08] brother Adam covers it that there'll be
[22:10] no rapture without these virtues
[22:17] you say well why the rapture sovan not
[22:20] really no come on Anna we thought it'd
[22:23] be a long time ago it's our problem he
[22:29] says these the person with these virtues
[22:32] is the one that's going into rapture
[22:36] well I see then I'm serious
[22:40] in the point that I've always been
[22:41] serious that looking at those things and
[22:44] studying the word from 50 years ago
[22:46] coming and still thinking the same today
[22:49] how do we get those virtues if we must
[22:56] have them and to the people that are
[23:02] going to be changed in a moment in the
[23:04] twinkling of an eye that group of people
[23:08] is going to be though standing there
[23:10] with the virtues now they may go by the
[23:14] grave for other things or not but I'm
[23:16] talking about the change when I talk
[23:20] about rapture all right
[23:22] see that what's the point of the rapture
[23:26] the virtues the thing all of it tie
[23:28] together in the simple thoughts of a
[23:33] prophet brain about the new birth come
[23:41] on that's that's the point you were to
[23:44] think on he made it simple we get to new
[23:49] birth then we get a growth development
[23:51] in the word to the position the word
[23:55] that we can be qualified for a change of
[23:57] these bodies you say well what see
[24:01] that's the point what has it been so
[24:03] long because of the bride now what did
[24:10] we talk about the bride what did we talk
[24:16] about her this past Wednesday we went in
[24:20] the scriptures there in in Ephesians
[24:23] they would
[24:25] one awake thou that sleepest and we
[24:29] talked about where the prophet said that
[24:34] it was the bride asleep in them
[24:40] denomination's know what about it the
[24:48] bride being a I'm not asleep I'm wide
[24:51] awake I'm in this message well that was
[24:57] back yonder now when we was in them
[24:59] denominations and then we come out of
[25:02] them denominations and now we're in the
[25:06] bride age you're only in the bride age
[25:08] if you're birthed into them you're gonna
[25:11] get down to that one one of these days
[25:13] the Prophet says you birthed into this
[25:15] you birthed into this you virgins there
[25:17] there's a bride age you got to be
[25:18] birthed into it
[25:19] the bride's not in lady will see us know
[25:22] the bride's not she's birthed into the
[25:24] age of the opening of the word that's
[25:28] where the trouble has been if people are
[25:30] not believing what the word have said
[25:33] and watching it or for the hour and time
[25:37] that we're living you're trying to
[25:40] figure it out with something to put
[25:42] darter to make it work and it won't work
[25:44] it has to be God revealing it and making
[25:48] it manifest all right so then what do we
[25:53] talk about what's that in a minute when
[25:56] we get back to it
[25:57] under awakening of the bride the Bible
[26:06] says revelation 18:4
[26:07] come out of her my people that you be
[26:09] not partakers of her plagues and things
[26:16] yeah we're just sleeping the home ceased
[26:23] it's getting worse and worse and Peter's
[26:25] just falling away it's just falling back
[26:28] and just getting less concerned
[26:37] you say well you don't pick on me
[26:40] well I ain't picking on you if there's
[26:43] anything the word is doing the picking I
[26:45] don't have them do that
[26:47] but now listen we must have these
[26:52] virtues the said to bring us to a place
[26:57] of rapture and faith all right now and
[27:02] to have these virtues there must be a
[27:05] way that we can receive them so that's
[27:09] what we covered Wednesday night we've
[27:10] covered it over over I preached this for
[27:13] 40-something years what how that we get
[27:17] these virtues is what if these virtues
[27:23] were in the early church and the Prophet
[27:27] said they were they had it in the least
[27:29] little nod huh but down to the dark ages
[27:32] and things the channel and ways of these
[27:35] things has went away until you kind of
[27:38] how the returning of the faith of the
[27:40] fathers and what is the returning of the
[27:42] faith our revelation of the father's to
[27:45] bring these virtues back into the church
[27:47] right that's the simple thing to me that
[27:52] that I've always looked at it's the
[27:53] faith of the fathers it's to see to come
[27:56] back to where they were and that's why
[27:59] I've always tried to get you to see it
[28:01] the Peter standing there saying I'm
[28:04] speaking to born-again believers today
[28:06] said and said now we've got to grow into
[28:10] these things and said to do that we've
[28:12] got to how these virtues and things all
[28:16] right and as he does he's trying to
[28:18] teach us how to get to where he was but
[28:23] that was lost to the dark ages and time
[28:26] until you bother to come out of it with
[28:28] a new birth right but then promised that
[28:33] it would be restored is Malaca for a
[28:36] promise you won't I send you Elijah the
[28:41] prophet and he that's a promise well
[28:46] just because it would be brought forth
[28:49] in brother Branham
[28:50] that doesn't mean that it's made
[28:52] manifest by you and me no there's a lot
[28:55] of difference in that a lot of
[28:58] difference in what he made manifesting
[28:59] what me and you running around with what
[29:03] you see then 327 church age book this
[29:07] messenger malachi for luke 1730
[29:09] revelation 2:10 7 another word Allah is
[29:11] gonna do two things
[29:13] what 1 turn the hearts of the children
[29:15] back to the face of the Father that's
[29:19] what he come far alright but he didn't
[29:23] finish that now he tells us how that is
[29:25] to be done because and to to reveal the
[29:29] seven thunders which is a revelation
[29:31] contained in the seven seals and it'll
[29:34] be these divinely revealed mystery
[29:36] truths that literally turn us back all
[29:39] right now he's turning us telling us how
[29:41] that it can happen by those seven
[29:44] thunders well nobody don't know what
[29:47] those thunders are your prophet said it
[29:50] was the voice of God
[29:51] so I'm solved with that you can argue
[29:53] how you want to and this got to be this
[29:55] and it's got to be that anything you
[29:57] tell me that's got to be it's gonna come
[30:00] back to the revealing of the word come
[30:04] on I done been around too long so don't
[30:06] think that's I'm not serious about doing
[30:09] it I've already been through Island you
[30:11] say oh them say I'm done it that's the
[30:12] third book but a wren said a third pools
[30:15] opening of the word yeah but take this
[30:21] that that's up between you and God and
[30:23] what he wants to do about it I'm just
[30:26] answering the question the third bull is
[30:28] the opening of the word that's what your
[30:32] prophet said but do we believe that oh
[30:35] we believe that but we want this all
[30:38] this other stuff to put something to her
[30:40] we don't believe and stand on order all
[30:44] right let's believe one thing let's take
[30:46] what we can prove to be true and stand
[30:49] on it and believe it right see then my
[30:55] contention that's been all alone the new
[30:57] birth is a revealing on God's Word we'll
[30:59] see this that settles that that's what
[31:02] we're talking about it life not you know
[31:04] and you think about it brother Branham
[31:08] when he would say something he's telling
[31:11] you what the Word of God says I thought
[31:18] that's what we believe the Prophet was
[31:19] supposed to come and do was to tell us
[31:22] what the word says and the word is God
[31:25] all right as we were talking about
[31:27] Wednesday night then see where the
[31:30] Prophet said the Thunder is the voice of
[31:32] God when the seal breaks he's the one
[31:36] time and I gave it to you in C he said
[31:38] it thundered from my inside the throne
[31:42] he said now here stood the lamb all
[31:45] right what's he doing a channel for
[31:47] things to come forth the voice of God
[31:50] speaking from eternity to tell the lamb
[31:53] what to bring forth and what to write
[31:55] all right then wants to go next the
[31:59] thunders a voice of God all right the
[32:03] voice of God then would transfer from
[32:06] the lamb who would take the book and
[32:10] open the seals it would transfer from
[32:13] the lamb to the end time prophet right
[32:18] you still got the voice of God you still
[32:24] got the voice of God you got it coming
[32:26] down to understanding now when it comes
[32:32] to the Prophet then where does it go
[32:33] from there it goes to the fivefold
[32:38] ministry now that's what your Bible says
[32:40] and that's what your prophet said but
[32:44] you get it irony back up see you follow
[32:46] me okay God there's a voice and he
[32:49] stunner and then the Prophet the Lamb
[32:51] the Bligh's forth and all and then the
[32:54] Prophet gets it and you're doing good
[32:56] are you riding luck that's real good but
[32:58] then you say now sapphire phone industry
[33:03] is the voice of God
[33:06] I listen folks I don't mind being
[33:11] straight and playing always been will
[33:13] you never try to hide nothing always
[33:16] just been straight
[33:17] I don't argue with anybody about a lot
[33:21] of this called fivefold ministry people
[33:27] of this message I don't blame you for
[33:30] not wanting to hear oh but you know what
[33:34] if there's a false
[33:36] there is a true some work right if
[33:43] there's a false there's a true somewhere
[33:45] okay so the voice of God is still
[33:49] sounding now listen we didn't end that
[33:52] see that's where people take you I mean
[33:54] they'll stop on that line and else Ward
[33:56] I don't see about five whole minutes I'm
[33:58] saying they don't they don't go on with
[34:00] it to the basis of seeing that the life
[34:03] stage of that voice of God the Thunder
[34:06] is in the bride of Jesus Christ it comes
[34:10] to you and it's speaking to you
[34:12] personally to you and you're sounding
[34:15] that voice
[34:16] I thought the Prophet said the bride
[34:19] would be the final voice and my quoted
[34:25] him to the final age that's where people
[34:32] say Oh y'all are this one this is that
[34:33] the other you ain't never said talked to
[34:36] a oneness and got it right a oneness has
[34:40] just hold it to one manifestation of God
[34:42] or Jesus was the last one I differ with
[34:45] that totally little random wooden lifes
[34:48] manifestation of God either the bride of
[34:51] Jesus Christ is the lights manifestation
[34:54] that's what your prophet said but do we
[34:59] believe it so I'm trying to put it down
[35:02] to where your app getting you to see who
[35:05] you are and what's going on you realize
[35:09] because God spoke to the Prophet doesn't
[35:12] mean that he spoke to me and you he does
[35:15] that by way of the Prophet to speak but
[35:18] that's the voice of God
[35:20] if the Thunder is the voice of God and
[35:23] we read it over and over Wednesday night
[35:24] to you where the Prophet was giving them
[35:27] that that it's the voice of God when
[35:29] when the seal breaks and all the thing
[35:31] these seven thunders they say but we
[35:37] don't need this we don't Lee why don't
[35:39] we need it we need something you go out
[35:42] to admit one thing we've been around
[35:43] here a long time I think it's time to
[35:45] wake up and quit playing around with you
[35:47] sugar tits we've been around here a long
[35:51] time how much longer you think we got
[35:56] but that's one thing that I've always
[35:58] said and you watch it in what Abdullah
[36:00] could have always believed in a revival
[36:02] of the opening of the word and see then
[36:04] this message has never died in me from
[36:07] the day that I started in this message
[36:09] it's been opening and it's still opening
[36:13] way to the other day was here preaching
[36:16] like everything and I preached the seals
[36:17] three times I know and all at once I saw
[36:21] the second seal open it's like that well
[36:29] come to a proper opinion you know I
[36:31] don't know everything but I know a god
[36:36] it knows everything I'm still learning
[36:39] I'm still gaining ground if you ever get
[36:42] to the point do you think that you're
[36:44] not gaining ground you're in bad shape
[36:47] the Word of God is still unfolding
[36:49] itself and even after we leave this
[36:52] world and go into the eternity zhh the
[36:56] Prophet said there'll be a message of
[36:58] cheer down to the endless ages it would
[37:04] still be an unfolding of God or
[37:06] revealing of God even after we leave
[37:09] this world I've always said it this way
[37:12] we're just getting enough here to be
[37:13] able to understand that that's the best
[37:17] way I can say it all right but do you
[37:19] see what I'm talking about how do we get
[37:21] those virtues it's got to be by the
[37:24] seven thunders all right if the thunders
[37:27] is not sounded we can't get it
[37:30] I've blind okay is that straight enough
[37:33] we if the thunders ain't sounding you
[37:36] can't get it go we're going to read
[37:37] where the Prophet said it's the person
[37:39] with these virtues that's going to go in
[37:43] the rapture and then we can't how the
[37:45] virtues without having the thunders so
[37:52] we're gonna haul die and go by the grave
[37:54] and this whole thing is going to be a
[37:57] flop no somebody is going to believe it
[38:03] and stand up for it well why not let it
[38:06] be you and me we fought over all of
[38:09] these doctrines and ideas and opinions
[38:12] of people of the message when those
[38:15] demons come in and try to take away and
[38:18] pull this and pull that and we fold it
[38:21] out why can't we rejoice about what we
[38:26] see thanks don't say nothing what I said
[38:32] you're saying the words not opening you
[38:36] know whose fault it is yours it's your
[38:42] fault because you're not accepting what
[38:45] God is sending I don't make nothing out
[38:49] of me or any other fivefold ministry or
[38:51] whatever but it does make one thing for
[38:53] sure your prophets when it said it and
[38:55] your Bibles when it said it that the
[38:57] fivefold ministry was for the perfecting
[38:59] of the Saints now do you believe that he
[39:06] said fill me up with these virtues that
[39:08] I might teach others to bring these
[39:10] things to pi that's in the stacks of
[39:14] perfect man you're supposed to have read
[39:17] and listened to all right but listen
[39:20] that see then by Malecha for the message
[39:32] according to the prophet noon the
[39:35] thunders would sound to the Prophet he
[39:40] sounds it out to you and I
[39:43] and God makes it manifest as the
[39:46] revealed word right the opening of the
[39:51] word is the revealing of Jesus Christ to
[39:56] you and I all right because that way
[40:00] then you can hold good that that voice
[40:04] that you hear but you know what let me
[40:12] ask you a simple question or a thought
[40:15] why is it that you don't wife to all
[40:18] these doctrines and ideas that it went
[40:20] for the message when the people of the
[40:25] message is when I threw why didn't you
[40:27] go after it and some of you did and
[40:30] fluttered around and flattered around a
[40:32] little bit and played with it some but
[40:35] you've come back enough to understand
[40:37] that those things wouldn't right well
[40:40] that's what I got against you brother
[40:41] there because you just you just make it
[40:44] too plain
[40:46] you expose me one day when we're
[40:52] standing at the bar of judgment I want
[40:57] to ask you a question did you want to be
[41:01] exposed our be exposed here I want to
[41:08] get mine right here I don't care what it
[41:10] takes
[41:10] I don't care what it takes how much
[41:12] repentance it takes how much what I'm
[41:14] doing it takes I want it right here I
[41:17] don't want no trouble at the river right
[41:21] come on then what are we thinking about
[41:24] okay now watch what I'm getting at watch
[41:31] the point that I'm getting at the whole
[41:34] thing was the point of it Wednesday
[41:36] night the Prophet tells us the thunders
[41:42] the only way to get the virtues is for
[41:46] the thunders to sound forth mr. Masoner
[41:52] Malachi 4 luke 1730 revelation 10 say
[41:54] I'm going to do two things 1 turn the
[41:55] hearts of the children back
[41:56] to reveal this unders which is
[41:59] revelation contained in the seven seals
[42:01] in to be these divinely revealed mystery
[42:03] truths that literally turn our arts by
[42:04] okay you can't argue with that
[42:08] ask your prophet a question than let him
[42:11] answer it brother Branham what is the
[42:13] new birth they've been so much confusion
[42:15] about the new bar what is a new birth
[42:17] cross the mystery of God revealed he
[42:19] said the new birth is a revelation of
[42:20] Jesus Christ personally to you brother
[42:23] Branham what is the thunders he says the
[42:28] force of God when the seal bright
[42:34] brother branham what's going to bring
[42:36] rapture in faith you see this where I'm
[42:47] putting it all together and been doing
[42:49] it for quite a while have you been
[42:51] watching it see then if we don't want to
[42:54] know how to get these virtues it's got
[42:56] to be by the opening of the word of
[42:58] those seven thunders that's what's your
[43:01] prophet said all right now go to step
[43:03] two
[43:05] look what he says we read this Wednesday
[43:11] they can pull it up they want to number
[43:13] eight but that's alright which is 356
[43:23] Lady of seeing church age now let me say
[43:28] this here I don't believe that God is
[43:30] calling only to the false vine to repent
[43:32] in this verse he is talking to the elect
[43:37] you've got it I read it they have
[43:40] something to something they have some
[43:42] repenting to do to many of his children
[43:45] are still in those false churches now he
[43:49] didn't a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[43:52] you know you could put Brandon Monson
[43:55] aren't you no or Lula eyes all round
[44:03] there of those of whom it speaks in
[44:06] Ephesians 5 and 14 awake now that
[44:09] sleepers in Iraq
[44:10] from the dead in Christ shall give thee
[44:12] life to be asleep is not to be dead
[44:14] these are the sleeping amongst the dead
[44:18] you know Paul you remember what he said
[44:21] over there that he wanted an out
[44:23] resurrection
[44:26] you know what Paul wanted an out
[44:28] resurrection come on that scripture he
[44:32] said they've been out he wanted an out
[44:33] resurrection out from among the dead
[44:40] an out resurrection from among the dead
[44:47] look to be asleep is not to be dead
[44:50] these are sleeping amongst the dead
[44:53] they're out there in the dead
[44:55] denominations they're floating along
[44:58] with their they are floating alone with
[45:02] them God cries out wake up repent of
[45:06] your folly hear their lending their
[45:08] influence even giving their time and
[45:09] their money actually their very lives to
[45:11] these Antichrist organization and all
[45:14] the wild thinking is alright they need
[45:17] to repent they must repent they need to
[45:18] have a change of mind and turn toward
[45:21] the truth what about it
[45:27] what's going to wake us up folks okay
[45:31] go to number seven while you're on there
[45:34] and we'll see paragraph 182 of the third
[45:39] seal now that's what to read what's the
[45:44] reason today that the revivals that were
[45:47] supposed to have listened oh they ain't
[45:55] no more revivals there ain't no more
[46:00] world wide sweeping revivals but the
[46:04] bride now listen to what he says
[46:05] hearings and read it in listen we have
[46:09] denominational revivals we haven't had a
[46:12] real stirring no no no no sir don't
[46:16] think we've got revivals we haven't well
[46:18] they got millions and millions of church
[46:20] members but not a revival nowhere
[46:24] no no the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[46:33] there's been no revival no manifestation
[46:36] of God to stir the bride yet this is
[46:40] right in the middle of the seals come on
[46:49] there's been no revival no manifesting
[46:52] God to stir the privacy we're looking
[46:54] for it
[46:56] it will take those seven unknown
[47:00] thunders back there to wake her up again
[47:04] he will send it he promised it now
[47:08] he said she's dead then what about it
[47:18] but I mean you mentioned this and that's
[47:21] what I say on the internet under this
[47:22] life and like everything ain't gonna be
[47:26] no more revivals brother L don't
[47:27] understand ain't no more revival I've
[47:30] understood this and forty years ago I've
[47:32] never looked for a world wide sweeping
[47:35] revival because your prophet said no
[47:38] those are over now listen he said the
[47:42] life's world sweeping revival was a
[47:45] Zeus's Street come on he said the life's
[47:58] world sweeping revival was Azusa Street
[48:04] right in the middle of the seals the
[48:08] greatest revival that has ever been is
[48:13] transpiring right
[48:19] it's not a world wide sweeping revival
[48:22] it's a world wide sweeping revival of
[48:26] the opening of God's Word it spread all
[48:32] over the whole world from that one
[48:35] little man called an Azusa Street the
[48:40] life's world wide sweeping revival
[48:42] he said they ain't gonna be no more he
[48:44] said the next one it's the two witnesses
[48:45] to is rule of that form right in the
[48:50] midst of the said while ago right in the
[48:52] midst of him saying this is operating in
[48:55] the greatest room that I've ever
[48:57] operated in you think he wouldn't have
[49:04] it a revival you think it wasn't
[49:11] something to him for those seals to
[49:14] break that brought to him the revelation
[49:20] of Jesus Christ and showed him all about
[49:23] the Antichrist and all of the things a
[49:31] world wide sweeping revival of the
[49:34] opening of God's Word not a world wide
[49:38] sweeping revival of signs and wonders
[49:40] and different thing that said to you
[49:45] Wednesday night what don't you count the
[49:50] day of of the Holy Ghost falling on
[49:53] there in the Bible in the upper room
[49:55] when you call that a world wide sweeping
[49:57] revival didn't it produce a world wide
[49:59] sweeping revival from that from the book
[50:04] of Acts we yet it was not one sign or
[50:07] wonder in the upper room come on
[50:16] they wouldn't signs and wonders outside
[50:18] to get the people's attention those come
[50:22] on gradually even go over to do the
[50:28] Gentiles the door being opened and when
[50:31] you do you don't seek manifestation
[50:34] while we got so much on the
[50:36] manifestation as to something to show
[50:38] revival when your prophet would tell you
[50:43] that he was operating in the greatest
[50:45] room that had ever been and he said
[50:55] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[50:57] to wake her up all right no wonder where
[51:09] people are not in a revival they don't
[51:11] know what a revival is see we Baptists
[51:15] knew you you'll quote it with us right
[51:17] that reviving is not to revive a sinner
[51:22] it's a Christian supposed to get revived
[51:25] because you can't revive a sinner it's
[51:28] supposed to be a Christian it was
[51:30] Christian straightening up and getting
[51:32] their lives right and God coming forth
[51:34] and doing as it did then the people
[51:37] around are beginning to see that
[51:39] happening and then they come to the
[51:40] altar to accept Jesus Christ as their
[51:42] Savior come on sure why can't we read
[51:48] the prophet and listen sitting there
[51:50] this morning looking where there was
[51:52] revival in ever church age where there's
[51:56] been revival after revival after revival
[51:58] all the way down through there but there
[52:01] was only certain revivals that was
[52:03] worldwide sweeping and this revival of
[52:07] em combi is only for the elect no seven
[52:13] unknown thunders is only for the elect
[52:16] it is not for the world sure they can
[52:22] get the effects of it and everything but
[52:24] it's not for them
[52:28] all right then the thunders being what
[52:32] will bring us back with the the virtues
[52:39] right now we see and I hope you would
[52:43] follow that Wednesday now we see for
[52:46] surety that the those seven unknown
[52:50] thunders is what wakes her up but have
[52:58] you been woke up by the word it's been
[53:00] revealed to you going to is it the sound
[53:06] of the end time sir I believe is the one
[53:08] go in there and get that list of the
[53:11] things that brother Branham was saying
[53:13] about that has been made known in this
[53:15] last day you remember what he was saying
[53:18] predestination straightened out one god
[53:20] no eternal Hill all these things like
[53:23] that
[53:24] he less about and he he comes down and
[53:27] he leaves out number eight from
[53:31] Schofield riddle and that is the bride
[53:34] becoming one with the work when he left
[53:37] that out I don't know nothing to me I
[53:40] don't care I disappointed work it did he
[53:42] left out number eight is coming down
[53:45] well but all of the things look what God
[53:48] has done for you and I look where he has
[53:53] brought us from by the opening of the
[53:55] word I mean are you afraid that if
[54:02] brother Dale said I'm gonna have a I'm
[54:04] gonna have a Baptist preacher come
[54:05] Sunday and straighten us out I'm gonna
[54:11] having to come in straighten us out on
[54:13] the Godhead and many of you'd be afraid
[54:17] to come you'd be afraid to come then you
[54:25] know for sure you don't understand the
[54:27] truth
[54:28] I don't I don't want to do this well I
[54:33] might get deceived honey don't worry
[54:35] about it when you've got that dog you
[54:38] already deceived you just ain't buying
[54:42] enough or woman enough to admit it what
[54:47] you see what it's doing God has promised
[54:52] us look at the point what I'm talking
[54:59] about the Bible promised Malachi 4 that
[55:06] God would send a prophet then told us
[55:12] what he would do turn the hearts of the
[55:14] children and turn Shielders fathers who
[55:16] turn a bow ways code it would be dealing
[55:18] with the spirit and power of Elijah but
[55:21] the last days would come down to a
[55:23] Gentile prophet to bring the word to
[55:26] return us back to the faith of the
[55:28] father what is the faith of the father
[55:34] the revelation of the father's how many
[55:36] gods did did the apostles how did they
[55:43] preach anything about eternal hell did
[55:46] they preach anything about all of these
[55:47] messed up doctrines and it wasn't from
[55:51] the Apostles they were the ones that
[55:54] straightened all of that out and laid it
[55:57] in order I'm just trying to get you to
[56:01] think if God promised something why
[56:05] can't we say God bring it to Pais are
[56:15] you afraid of the word are you afraid to
[56:22] put God to the point of asking him then
[56:26] Lord bring the truth to us if he killed
[56:28] every one of us right
[56:36] but are you listening to what I'm saying
[56:39] here's a prophet telling you about world
[56:41] wide sweeping revival yes they ain't
[56:43] gonna be no more world wide sweeping
[56:45] revival Azusa Street was the life one of
[56:48] those but then he talks about listen how
[56:53] many of these do you need that in the
[56:55] fifties and ona the promise of God to
[56:58] bring a revival and what about when he
[57:05] gets into the opening of the seals in
[57:07] the time the greatest revival the world
[57:11] has ever seen was to the opening of
[57:15] those seven seals
[57:20] don't say no revival I don't see them
[57:25] going on and now that you had it throw
[57:28] it in my face like this if we're were we
[57:31] think we are if we're were we think we
[57:39] are why any more signs and wonders
[57:41] that's exactly right there that's still
[57:44] unbelief that's the thing that's keeping
[57:46] it from happening is the fact that we're
[57:50] not believing it to say this is it
[57:55] I've had people to throw it in my face
[57:57] well one of that brother so-and-so he
[58:01] brought that to Lourdes or to soldier
[58:03] but that's his way now he's got a right
[58:05] to believe what he wants to not
[58:08] according to my Bible he doesn't well
[58:12] that's his business that's right but
[58:14] it's my business to tell you according
[58:15] to my Bible we none of us got no rights
[58:18] we forfeited all those rights to accept
[58:21] Jesus Christ it's for brother Dale you
[58:26] shouldn't be so hard to sign you don't
[58:28] listen to brother Adam raking the cold
[58:30] Rover sitting among the Pentecostal
[58:34] people in the 50s and things and
[58:36] teaching adoption and said that's where
[58:39] you messed up at on the seal book he
[58:43] said they cabbage down on it
[58:44] he said you messed up on the basis
[58:47] you're not believing
[58:48] God's Word you think he wasn't hard and
[58:55] strong no no he was sweet you know he
[59:00] was sweet all right
[59:03] but are you listening
[59:06] what revival brother devil are you
[59:08] talking about opening of God's Word that
[59:12] each day is I read God's Word in living
[59:15] and when he unfolds it to me
[59:17] that brings up into me a the greatest
[59:22] thing that could ever happen in the
[59:24] world is to God to reveal to a human
[59:28] being his word you're not happy about
[59:35] that
[59:36] you're not happy about what you say oh
[59:38] you just exalted of what you say and
[59:40] that's where it is right there you
[59:42] things out it well like one thing about
[59:44] it I spent my life to learn what this
[59:46] prophet said you started using the
[59:48] Walmarts and the hangouts and everything
[59:50] else instead of studying the Word of God
[59:57] but I don't want to be an inlet now
[59:59] don't worry about it the intellect ain't
[1:00:04] gonna do none of us no good but
[1:00:06] stupidity ain't either
[1:00:10] right oh I just want to be humble
[1:00:13] brother Dale you don't want to be humble
[1:00:15] you need to be humble I try that's my
[1:00:25] problem then once you're alright but are
[1:00:30] you listening it's gonna take the seven
[1:00:35] unknown thunders to wake the bride up
[1:00:39] it's going to take those seven unknown
[1:00:42] thunders to bring the virtues it's going
[1:00:48] to take those seven unknown thunders to
[1:00:50] bring us to rapture in faith
[1:00:58] come on what about it
[1:01:03] rapture in faith let's see if I can get
[1:01:08] this one all right we just covered it
[1:01:15] from Anna lady you see in church age
[1:01:17] where he said something must wake up the
[1:01:19] bride
[1:01:20] that's asleep something must wake her up
[1:01:25] and it must bring us to a revival listen
[1:01:32] to your prophet 1962 letting off the
[1:01:34] pressure now some of these they don't
[1:01:35] have some let me do I have kind of
[1:01:38] listened as 1962 then Elizabeth I've
[1:01:43] kind of listened and watched my
[1:01:45] Pentecostal brethren as they have
[1:01:48] predicted a sweeping revival coming and
[1:01:54] we all know that the revival that we've
[1:01:59] just went through has ceased are you
[1:02:03] reading it come on now
[1:02:07] but there must be never remember 62 this
[1:02:11] is not to seal he said it ceased but
[1:02:15] there must be coming something else
[1:02:18] that's glorious and great and so I've
[1:02:27] been studying hard to find these places
[1:02:30] in the scripture I think that if our
[1:02:34] revelation must be scriptural then we
[1:02:38] know it's right if it's a scripture it's
[1:02:43] from the Lord and I'm beginning to
[1:02:45] believe that that's right and there's
[1:02:47] coming a ripening time for the evening
[1:02:50] fruits something like he was looking for
[1:02:55] something sound like all the way through
[1:02:58] there that's what I'm just telling you
[1:03:00] listen to the message and see how that
[1:03:05] your prophet is always looking for
[1:03:07] something to take place
[1:03:12] and even after the opening of the seals
[1:03:18] he was looking for something to take
[1:03:21] place he said they'll come such a
[1:03:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost that her fill
[1:03:29] every fiber of our being and take us in
[1:03:32] the rapture was the prophet looking
[1:03:37] forward to something or was he looking
[1:03:39] at it okay here's woman this is three
[1:03:50] kind of believers 1963 1124 in the
[1:03:52] paragraph 97 that's the reason I do
[1:03:54] believe that when the bride is called
[1:03:56] out and elected and said in the book of
[1:03:58] life there will come a sound from heaven
[1:04:02] that'll take such a baptism of the Holy
[1:04:04] Spirit into that bride that'll take her
[1:04:07] from the earth in a rapture in grace God
[1:04:10] promised it church what's gonna change
[1:04:17] you and I what's going to put us into
[1:04:21] the place a rapture in faith everything
[1:04:28] is linked upon the basis of whether or
[1:04:33] not those seven thunders have sounded I
[1:04:42] can show you in the seal book things
[1:04:45] that looks like that the Prophet even
[1:04:47] questioned but when he finished the week
[1:04:54] he said that's what it's been he said
[1:04:58] it's been the angels of the Lord
[1:05:00] bringing me back here for this message
[1:05:04] he said tonight
[1:05:13] the promises of God are yin amen but to
[1:05:20] think about it wake her up
[1:05:26] restore to her the faith of the father's
[1:05:30] let's see if I can get to how much
[1:05:31] number I think we've just read it
[1:05:35] number seven yeah all right here's what
[1:05:42] I want to get to then all I don't have
[1:05:43] will get to this will quit what about a
[1:05:49] prophet crying out for awakening in our
[1:05:51] soul is there not something burdening
[1:05:55] you and troubling you as to the day and
[1:05:59] the hour that we're living and why
[1:06:02] things are running like they are you're
[1:06:04] not troubled and burdened about that
[1:06:08] you're not concerned about the age in
[1:06:11] the time and the hour that we're living
[1:06:17] well let's finish it with this they
[1:06:22] don't have this one but I got a statue
[1:06:24] of a perfect man
[1:06:27] paragraph 352 through 57 58 then God
[1:06:36] representing his church as a bride a
[1:06:39] woman God represents his church as a
[1:06:41] bride and the way he brings each
[1:06:44] individual to being his son to go in
[1:06:49] that bride he also brought the bride
[1:06:52] through those ages all right till he
[1:06:57] brings this one complete church he saw
[1:07:01] my feet moving and all in Luther can do
[1:07:03] all it but each age God has promised
[1:07:08] these things into his church and
[1:07:11] pattered it by showing that each
[1:07:14] individual has these possesses these
[1:07:18] qualities and this being when it's
[1:07:21] completed listen
[1:07:23] is the Church of God Nathan about the
[1:07:26] church right and then you Church
[1:07:28] individual listening and this being when
[1:07:30] it's completed is the Church of God
[1:07:33] going in the rapture and this being now
[1:07:38] that's the church right now listen to it
[1:07:41] and this being and completed is a
[1:07:45] servant of God in the Church of God
[1:07:49] that's going in the rapture then the
[1:07:58] whole stature of your being is governed
[1:08:01] and controlled by these things but it
[1:08:03] cannot be completely controlled until
[1:08:05] it's completely possesses these virtues
[1:08:11] what about it
[1:08:18] what do we think we've got another 40
[1:08:21] years 50 year and I'm the guy that has
[1:08:30] stood here in 1974 and proved to you by
[1:08:34] brother Branham and the quote that we
[1:08:37] could pass the Year 2026 I said that in
[1:08:42] 74 and I'm still today even welcome to
[1:08:45] the tapes to listen to it but I did not
[1:08:49] want it to go this far and it have not
[1:08:51] wanted it to go this far
[1:08:53] and I'm not gloating in the fact that I
[1:08:56] knew that it would I know there's one
[1:09:01] thing for certain
[1:09:02] it is not time in ways and elements
[1:09:06] he said I'm scared of your experiences
[1:09:08] it's a revelation from God brother
[1:09:13] Branham says rapture message the bride
[1:09:15] would be waiting for the revelation of
[1:09:19] the rapture now the bride would be
[1:09:24] waiting for the revelation it's going to
[1:09:30] take these divinely revealed tools of
[1:09:36] the thunders to turn our hearts back
[1:09:38] it's gonna take that to bring us to a
[1:09:40] rapture in condition why are the people
[1:09:44] secured of it then why are the people
[1:09:47] scared of the seals when they afraid
[1:09:53] they can't talk on it right why the
[1:09:55] afraid of Daniel seventy weeks
[1:10:05] when your prophet said in the Daniel 70
[1:10:07] weeks book just open the front page and
[1:10:09] read if you've got the book open
[1:10:12] entreated he says you can't understand
[1:10:17] the seals of the time if you don't
[1:10:20] understand Daniel 70 wait but why are
[1:10:23] people so scared of those things why not
[1:10:28] just try to bring what you can bring and
[1:10:31] bring it to a place that you can see it
[1:10:34] brother Dale what are you talking about
[1:10:36] I'm talking about there's like I've told
[1:10:38] you over and over and over when I
[1:10:43] started reading this message I saw God
[1:10:49] speaking to mankind not God that's
[1:10:54] brother Branham not those type of things
[1:10:57] I saw God using a man to bring his word
[1:11:02] that questions that we had little things
[1:11:07] that were so hindrance unto each one of
[1:11:10] us that he and his simplicity could
[1:11:13] explain the Godhead as you're a human
[1:11:18] being you're this you're that vain 3
[1:11:20] have a commit so simple that we could
[1:11:26] read it and understand it and for 50
[1:11:30] years still gaining ground reading this
[1:11:34] message it's a wonderful message to me
[1:11:41] it has the answer to every question that
[1:11:45] you have is in this message where are we
[1:11:55] willing to put it all on to that why do
[1:11:58] we want to hold just a little bit just
[1:12:00] in case
[1:12:07] why not just say this is it and let's go
[1:12:11] come on musicians what are you looking
[1:12:16] for brother day I'm not looking for I'm
[1:12:18] looking at I'm looking at the greatest
[1:12:22] revival I'll repeat it again while
[1:12:24] they're coming the greatest revival this
[1:12:27] world has ever had now listen
[1:12:32] greater than when Jesus walked here
[1:12:35] because when Jesus walked here there was
[1:12:38] no possibility of that being revealed
[1:12:43] because it was within him right and even
[1:12:51] the Holy Ghost coming on the day of
[1:12:52] Pentecost could not reveal the entire
[1:12:56] Word of God it would take God to send a
[1:13:01] prophet for our day and reading that in
[1:13:07] understanding those things and seeing
[1:13:10] that it's the greatest revival that has
[1:13:13] ever been brought around him you don't
[1:13:18] listen to something like that where he
[1:13:21] said I've seen the dead raised I've seen
[1:13:23] sick healed he said I've seen all kinds
[1:13:25] of miracles but this is he said I've
[1:13:28] never worked in this realm what was it
[1:13:31] he said this is the opening of the word
[1:13:34] by the same spirit well can't you be
[1:13:42] happy for what you've seen what you
[1:13:45] believe why can't you rejoice about
[1:13:49] where you believe that God has brought
[1:13:50] you from because look where we would be
[1:13:53] if he had to walk us that would still be
[1:13:55] out there asleep
[1:13:56] are we are we still asleep tonight today
[1:14:07] I think the word is true the greatest
[1:14:12] thing that has ever happened is right
[1:14:14] now happening but are you falling in it
[1:14:17] are you saying this is it
[1:14:21] well I'm let me be like they said if
[1:14:24] this ain't yet brought around what do
[1:14:25] you say he's let me keep this so that
[1:14:28] gets here right we'll see this is the
[1:14:33] opening of the word the most rejoicing
[1:14:37] revival that the people has ever had but
[1:14:41] yet nobody don't see the revival could
[1:14:47] it be that you spend your time reading
[1:14:49] other things I was looking at one just
[1:14:52] now and that before came out or brother
[1:14:54] Branham said talking about doing he said
[1:14:56] are these old magazines and things that
[1:15:00] you're reading and studying know more
[1:15:05] about everything else instead of the
[1:15:07] Word of God we could at least have by
[1:15:14] now have a foundation that we should not
[1:15:19] be worried about whether it'll stand it
[1:15:24] has stood the test so far down through
[1:15:26] the 70s the 80s the things and stood
[1:15:30] dark when I asked a person one time I
[1:15:38] said what if the rapture don't come by
[1:15:40] 77 they said I'll get out of the message
[1:15:43] then they said I'd say we misunderstood
[1:15:50] because it was a date or a time let's
[1:15:53] tan oh we got bread instead of the
[1:15:56] revealed word it was an idea or a
[1:15:59] concept we might have to change keys but
[1:16:02] it's a and anybody have an ad
[1:16:05] world in his hand they got the whole
[1:16:09] wide world it is hand you got you have

[1:16:37] way I did 40 years ago baby ain't died

[1:17:27] then he's revealing it in africa he's
[1:17:30] revealing it in china he's revealing it
[1:17:33] in the india he's revealing his word
