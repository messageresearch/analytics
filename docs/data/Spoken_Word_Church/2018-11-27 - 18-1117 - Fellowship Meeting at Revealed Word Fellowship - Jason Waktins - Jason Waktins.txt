========================================

[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] we ask them to [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] for these things when I thought the and [Music] in fact as we taking our offerings [Music] yes I feel I [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] don't worry those [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we press on like some of the works of song it made me think about Noah and one day you know what come on nowhere and he said he said it's gonna rain a lot of people gathered around that that's a some pretty fantastic and then after about six years well third of them left there's a good brain for this surgeon to make deals with Noah to do this stop popping Bo rein oh well that's a big church tax they increase it's gonna rain watch you know a lot of people started leaving it was a full-blown description pretty soon though the science began to be built in the art that there was no door so it's pretty much in and I would you wanted to are kept getting bills and the years kept going behind and people kept trying to get no one to stop preaching about rain but it didn't look right prophets message doesn't always look right near 65 there's hardly anybody left and then pretty soon someone had an idea about improve Noah's message so they began to bring up different versions of Noah's by boring different versions of Noah's message and they said no this of work we're going to get all the people to join up but just don't preach about the rain because it's it's embarrassing to preach about some little ol Kentucky exuded rain and all that all the reasons I wanna tell you today on this bright sunshiny day thus saith the Lord it's disappointing didn't know and not three so they're not disappointed they're angry at Noah remember the Holy Bible says as it was in the days of Moses were jettisoned jackers withstood the truth Moses was a prophet so wasn't that day a melody now begin to expect him so it being this last April Haley Bible says as in the days of Moses the Jackson generals were coming in to withstand the Moses of this state amen but Moses is missing the Bible says that God promised he would send you Elijah the prophet do it because he's promised by a prophecy he submit it's hard to be fairly for fear they are amen he promised that there'd be a great falling away before the that great day there is people have fallen all over it no matter what you want to believe there's a teacher teacher so here 19 don't you need to be older and he's preaching stronger than ever but the side to the Ark of getting built and the hinges and the doors are being put in now it's not so easy to get in and out and one day the door come up shut that door all I want to be in that secretes that passes all understanding that arc is the Word of God is the words laughing at the gospel of Jesus Christ we are entering into that same place o my heart along being that great black shirt and I believe that we will those that persevere unto the end by year 116 there's just his family life and he tried to try he tried out reach effected wanted to see that land in the city were work and they just didn't wanna listen to mark as they had better race then no Allah no one was old-fashioned and what he said this was wrong and false but the rains came shut the door Noah's family floated away from safety amen one day we're going to float out of this earth because this great artists right happy to be a part of that event believe it or order from the word persevere Turner's trained youth German up don't give up don't let Thomas Sanders continue on and as we hear the word of God today from our brother from the East Coast what you're hearing is that arc being built and solidified around your heart let that work so into your heart and that we might be stronger because they're coming many many people try to talk us out of this but you don't know I just know looks like Abraham we just got stronger in Stormers news when I fly Sara she got stronger and

constant constant bubble machine this was God's mercy fax and I'm easily cut through the whole reason they needed a deliverer like that wasn't any better cuz they were sinful I caused the love of BC and God sends them a deliverer a champion and something to help them from the consequence of their own syphilis a constant a bishop they were in bondage to an enemy is it that s club an enemy and instead of taking God's provided way a little bar militiamen proving bugs here they found him up in ropes platelet even had a like that's like the colander Alan Ameche Sampson said just promise me you

that any of us have the ability hey I got my seed a rally around it don't matter - yeah now this is super dope to get my mind clear my heart won't be them hey watch I'm sorry now I realize they they didn't have much of an example to build faith in it yeah I'm just sayin you know some some in the back one example of cookies that a flower read so I suppose it's somewhat understandable I love but that complicity than a compound this sermon began with this question the ceremony see a coma say Eric said kiss you when I started thinking about Samson does you're gonna say process of some song and I said to myself is amiss indeed and that's how I got it in my notes yes I says I'm an unholy spirit dealing with me they said let's play may not keep a bernanke and I thought well Samson wasn't a very good example some songs and to find one example so I can almost give him a pass I know some pretty they say your business skews it but what's my excuse but everyone did it with excuse what's our excuse yeah look this fuse God didn't send us a messenger that was on again off again I'm good dude as I bow my head loss there comes a consequence I didn't send us that kind of example to the bow an example of them sir God sent us a humble profit do the lamb perfect sent us a ministry that tours but from a minister any day even if it tore the hide off love us maybe some machine he told us the
