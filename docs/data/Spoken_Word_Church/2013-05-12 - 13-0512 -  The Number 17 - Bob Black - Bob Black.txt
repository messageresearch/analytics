TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning today I wanted to read from start on Isaiah 59 maybe um get into um I just felt kind of inspired to talk about some of the negative things that are going around lately on the internet and different things and take a close look at what at some things so let's start off with Isaiah 59 we get into the lesson and as you turn to that I I put up this scripture this this picture because I um one reason it's it's real nice and and another is because I morning brother d i I always thought it was just so amazing that as the children of Israel went through the the Wilderness they they could see the pillar of fire leading them in the cloud by by day and yet when they got to cadis Baria and the test really came K God lead us over and Deliver Us from these Giants in the land and lead us into the land they failed to believe the sign they failed to believe the sign that that that the signs that Moses have been given and they failed to believe all the things that God had done when it was right there staring him in the face and um so that's kind of what I wanted to talk about today let's look at Isaiah 59 and start at verse 9 therefore is Judgment far from us neither do justice overtake us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness we grope for the wall like the Blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men we roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far from us now uh before I continue reading it just to set the context think about this in the in the uh Israel their first king jeroboam began to he he placed in Dan and bethl two golden alts and he began to leave is lead is down the path of idolatry further and further away from God and as they went through king after King they went further and further away from God until after seven Kings they were Ahab married Ahab the seventh King married Jezebel and uh set up just if you looked at this at the economy and the society of Israel at that time you'd say well there's there's nobody left that believes God's word and so think about this in that kind of said in a context of um uh we're reading in Isaiah but I'm going to start talking about Elijah in a second we all like Bears verse 11 and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them and transgressing and lying against the Lord and departing away from our God God speaking oppression and Revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood and judgment is turned away backward and just to stand a far off for truth is fallen in the street and Equity cannot enter the think about this day when it looks so dark all around it it seems like if you just can profess that you know the truth then then people hate you yay truth fath and he that departeth from Evil maketh himself a prey you make yourself a prey because it it causes people to turn against you when you say I know what I'm talking about and the Lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him for he put on righteousness as a bre breastplate and in helment of Salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak and you we know that this is the scripture that Paul quote in Ephesians that we clothe ourselves with the breastplate of righteousness and and so on the Believers putting on these garments according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury Fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him amen so that's kind of what I want to talk about is a standard what is a standard and in the military when you know when they would ride forth with horses and and different things in the in the olden times they when they'd lift a banner up to let them know that they were still in control of the of the battle the side they were fighting for and when that Banner would fall somebody would pick it up to to let it so that everybody could look at that and give them hope a banner is and you know brother brand said this standard that that we have is God's word and he's lifting that up in us so that we can you know when you walk into Walmart or somebody sees you coming around the corner uh maybe a better example we had somebody come out yesterday to give us an estimate for a new deck and you could just see the man's look changed when my wife walked out of the house and addressed because she's a standard to the world because the word is made manifest in her and God all down Through the Ages when when uh Darkness would encroach upon the land like in the uh when the uh uh during Noah's time every the whole world was just in darkness and it looked like nobody else nobody was left to believe but God raised up a standard in Noah and then in David when uh he went to check on the uh on the battle and and nobody would go fight Goliath but the word rose up in David and he said I'll go fight him and he rose up and and the battle was won so all down Through the Ages the uh uh standard was God when it looked like God was no longer with the people he rose a standard and so in First Kings chapter 17 and in a minute we'll talk about the significance of 17 But First Kings chapter 17 this man comes on the scene suddenly now all down through First Kings 1-6 it tells all these stories of all the different Kings and how they went further and further into apostasy and then boom out of nowhere comes Elijah on the scene and what does he do he said says as the Lord God of Israel liveth that I serve no due or rain will fall on the earth until I call for and uh somebody a while back sent sent me an email of some questions they had about um uh just things that you know all the naysayers are saying these days and they're like well why did Brother Brown speak so harshly against women now you could say the same thing about Elijah when he said excuse me I I feel full up right now he said why you could say why did Elijah call for rain that looks so harsh but he he was trying God the word was raised up in him to be a standard to get people to repent to come back to the word and the reason brother random spoke so harshly about about women was because a woman is a manifestation of what the man is we the bride represents what God is you can see God in the bride making manifest and when you see a woman that's not living right she's a manifestation of something wrong with her husband and that that's straight talk but it's uh when you see when when I see in this church let me just be straight somebody coming up the the to the sanctuary with their their shirt halfway unbuttoned down to their Naval it it speaks it speaks against their husband that their husband doesn't realize that something is wrong and you know somebody look at all these things that brother ran up this the straight way that he talked about different things and think well um it it's so hard but then uh you know Jesus said Generation of Vipers and John said that ax is laid to the root of the tree if you don't bear forth fruit you'll be heed down and cast into fire and the whole object of it is to get people to repent and to surrender to God now uh as we look at criticism it's it's uh criticism is it's really of the devil you look at uh I had a brother telling me um about just a hard trial that he was going through and uh he he just confided in me the this this I won't say his name but the state was trying to take his children away from him and um just going through all these hard things and he said the hardest part was that Believers would call him on the phone and say well there's secret sin in your life you're not right and things like that because it's hard for somebody to look at somebody else and believe that God is in that person to overlook their faults maybe and so as as people are looking at brother rand's message and things they've got their own mental conception of how it's supposed to be and they begin to criticize but brother brandham said I have heard but now I see no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your names on if that genuine the Holy Ghost is in you you'll see the message in the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it there has to be something read on down that is it only the elected of God will see it and I I just it such a blessing in this day to just be able to understand and be able to see it just to you know even if you don't understand the seals completely and understand all Danel 7 weeks if you can say I believe that God sent a prophet and he sent him so that his word can be made manifest in us and that we can take a body change that's uh that's a huge blessing now talking about criticism I I wanted to look at this scripture because this is one that I I just love that brother Brown stumbled when he said this and this is one of my my FV I I've talked to several of of the people here in this church about this scripture and I I wanted to mention that this uh quote that brother R said and I wanted to mention it here because this uh if you got a copy of the latest catch the vision from the voice of God this is a question that somebody wrote in why did Brother brandom stumble and I just felt like they were so LED of the Lord in the answer that they gave in the little section with questions so this if you've never read this before this is where uh in looking at the Unseen God just takes over brother ROM's mouth and speaks through him and says I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave I'm the one that sent the Holy Ghost I'm the one that give the promise brother brand has nothing to do in this I have he surrendered his life to me I'm using his Spirit I'm talking through his lips that's me I'm the Lord so somebody with a a a big more education than they can handle say it like that uh looked at this and said well this is not grammatically correct if God were speaking to this man he would use perfect grammar he would speak in a without stumbling he would speak in a perfect way and because he didn't speak like that then I I can't believe it and that's really the the extent of all the different criticisms that are coming around in the message is comes in a way that they don't expect so here's the answer that that they gave in the in the cas div Vision I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the grave they said the grammatically preferred way to say this would be I'm the Lord who and they answered they didn't answer with their own opinion they answered from the word Ezekiel 79 and M eyes shall not spare neither will I give pity I will recompense the according to thy ways and th Abominations that are in the midst of thee and you shall know that I am the Lord that smiteth isn't that beautiful that's the way it's written in the Bible I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from the great the word up is up is unnecessary and informal in form correct English up should be admitted but in 1 Second Corinthians 4:14 it says knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you the Lord I have he surrendered his life to me question are we to believe that the Lord actually stumbled over his words here the incomplete sentence I have suggests a lack of forethought on the part of the one speaking but is Isaiah 28 says for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people I just I just thank the Lord for the truth and then the last one that's me I'm the Lord should be it is I I'm the Lord so I now they had in the in their answer that that's me is actually correct Modern English so I wanted to verify so uh this is the source this is a website that has all this grammatical stuff if you if you're interested you can have it but that's me is actually the correct way it's the correct grammar it is I is not we don't speak like that anymore so he was using perfect grammar although it didn't meet their expectations it didn't match what they expected it to be that that was correct now let's talk about the cloud but before we get into the cloud I want to talk about the number 17 the number 17 is an interesting number because it's the seventh prime number and when God vindicates his word all through scripture many times and you'll see as we go through he ties it with the number 17 uh so let's look at some examples in the Bible where he used the seven the number 17 Noah when he when Noah went in the ark he waited a whole week and y'all kind of ignore that I got all my answers up here on he waited in the ark a whole week and everybody was like where is the rain maybe all his children are saying where when is the rain going to come but then on the 17th day the rain came and he uh went around the world all the whole earth was covered with water and on the 17th day of the month uh he went in the AR the r rain fell on the second day of the 17th month and he rested on the seventh day sth month on the 17th day of the month but when the rain fell and when the AR rested was on the 17th day Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years before he died Joseph was 17 years when he was sold into slavery which is not really adequate description because in the Bible it talks about he was 17 years old and then it talks about how he had those V the dreams and the visions of the the stalks bowing and the and the Moon and the Earth and every everything so he was 17 years old when his dreams began to be fulfilled Elijah doesn't come on suddenly comes on the scene in First Kings chapter 17 Goliath was killed in 1 Samuel chapter 17 now these are all the standards that I was talking about earlier about David coming on the scene and killed Goliath Noah and and Joseph and the 17th book of the Bible was about a Vindicated bride what book is that anybody remember and okay Esther came forth she was the standard the 17th book of the Bible and in Genesis 17 is a type of Abraham receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost now many people forget Genesis 18 where the word came to Abraham and he talked to the word face to face but in Genesis 17 there a type of of Abraham receiving the baptism of Holy Ghost because God said uh Abraham walk before me now let's go through all these these scriptures of the of the Bride being Vindicated Luke 17 the sign even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed Luke 1:17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Eliah to turn the hearts of the father to the children and the Disobedience of the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord James 5:17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of 3 years and 6 months Luke 14:17 and send his servant at supper time to say to them they were bit that were bid come for all things are now ready now think about these as they apply to the messages we'll get we'll get in a second look at 17 in the message 1 Corinthians 15:51 51 is 17 * 3 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and when they and in 2 Kings 2 2:17 and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said sin they sent there for 50 men and they sought three days but found him not because was gone he would take a body chain the 1 Thessalonians 4:17 then we which are alive and remain shall be called up together with him in the clouds Matthew 17:11 and Jesus answered and said unto him them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things Luke 2451 and it came to pass while he blessed them he was departed from and from them and carried up into heaven and Ephesians 1:17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Lord may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him how do you know that You' got the Holy Ghost because he brings to you remembrance and shows you things to come the knowledge so now let's let's look at 17 in the message on the Ohio River he was baptized in the 17th person when the pillar of fire appeared and gave him his commission hear ye him was the sermon that he preached more than any other sermon and he recorded that 17 times and his text was Matthew 17 17 religions opposed brother Bram in Bombay and remember when he went over and he and he said anybody that can and that can heal this blind man come before me and I'll believe what you believe but if if I if if my God will heal this man then you give your life to the God that I serve and he issued that challenge I tell me there's nobody else ever has issued challenges like that they said if you if you have any Doctrine or disagreement when you come and stand beside me and show me where I'm wrong and nobody dare to stand besided but now people are getting on the Internet well after he's gone and saying all manner of things as a young boy brother Brandon was shot when he was 14 years old and he laid dying in the hospital the doctor said my boy you have 3 minutes more to live your heart is beating 17 times a minute he pastored this Baptist Tabernacle in Jeffersonville for 17 years at 1717 Spring Street when he was shot uh that's a duplicate on Hope's deathbed she told him where the money was to buy a rifle that cost $17 when he left Mina at that at that challenge he said I want to go I want to go see if this what I'm having is is really true and he left his wife to go go pray in the cave and he said I got $17 left that's all the money he had left he was going to go find out from God if God had really sent him see how much time I got uh 1700 came to the altar in Fort Wayne Indiana when the nazarine girl lifted her hands from the piano and 17,000 when the Sam Houston Coliseum for 17 nights of service when the pillar of fire appeared in 1973 his life story had been published to 17 L around the world now incredible Ministry is foretold in Matthew 17 Luke 17 in 17 verses of Luke 17: 21-37 in Revelation 107 which is 10 + 717 and Luke 1:7 the Seven Seals were preached on March the 17th and they were delivered in 10 messages over 7 days and the photographs of the of the cloud appeared in May in the May 17th edition of Life magazine so God using it through see how perfect it is that God is by the number 17 proving that this is the right this is the I'm vindicating it not just by the word but everything's matching up everything is just perfectly aligned now some OB objections about the cloud that that people are saying brother better makes it sound like he was on Sunset Peak when the photograph was taken his recollection appears inconsistent which removes confidence in his sermons on the seals his intent was to show that the cloud was formed when he received the vision so let's look at some quotes let's see what brother Brandon really said in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and he took the book opened the book and tore off the seals and sent it down to the Earth to the seventh angel to reveal it to his people God before he and here you him 1960 this is the one that he preached 17 times and he always used Matthew 17 God before he does anything always declares it in heaven first and then on Earth he declares that in the heavens above like the wise men saw the star come to Worship the Lord Jesus and then God always makes a witness of what he does I think all the way down through scripture first he declared Virgo in the heavens and then a virgin was born first he uh created that spiritual man Genesis 12627 then he put him in Earth and all down through scriptures he puts first he the wise men saw those three stars and then then they were led to the Infant Jesus he first he does it in Heavens and then he declares it so let's look at the cloud timeline did did he say this is what he said about when he where he was come follow me 1963 see I looked to see when it was and it was time same about day or two before or day or two after I was up there so in other words around the same time not necessarily the exact same time but around the same time so I I I put this timeline together it's kind of hard uh when you're just listening to people to see exactly when events occurred now if you disagree with this that's fine F but I put this together based on brother perig Green's testimony based on sister Rebecca Smith's uh publication the sunset Mountain that she put in only believe and uh this is also based on Fred San's uh testimony about when they were actually out in uh honey so in around January 1963 January early February uh he had he reached up his hands and the King sword appeared in his hands and which was the the word of the Lord given to him February 28th was the photograph was taken of the cloud in the evening March 4th he preached the absolute in Houston and on March 6th they started hunting March 7th in the morning the Angels Came to him picked him up and told him to go back east and begin preaching the Seven Seals on March 14th now now this this is these two dates are based on Fred sofin saying when when they were hunting so March 7th the angel the angels visited him which was 7 days after the cloud was photographed and then March 14th another 7 days they went arrived back in Jeffersonville and on March 17th the number 17 he started preaching the seals or he started preaching the Christ hi the Simplicity and the breach on that Sunday and then on May 17th uh now now remember he preached 10 10 sermons across 7 days and then on May 17th it was again Vindicated on the 17th day in Life Magazine so uh that's that's just real real quick so now now then so he God gave him the word to bring to us which is how we're Vindicated how how a man is is Vindicated by by let me slow down a second I'm speaking too fast by their fruits you shall know them this is what brother R about said about fruits is that your fruit is your Doctrine your fruit is your what is the fruit the word for the fruit of the season that's what it is they're teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the Season what time it is man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine or God's word for the season so that's next there they'll start attacking what he said to try to discredit it but uh just looking at this picture you know you could say it's uh this and that and everything but because brother brandom was called up with the angels and they gave him they took him to a different perspective and that's how we know that's how uh we can look into the word and see what's truth is because God gave brother Brandon the word to give to us to cause us to have a to look at things with a different perspective so many people looked at this picture and said oh I don't see anything and he said well you're looking at it the wrong way the Angels took me up so that I could look at it from a different perspective and he said you got to turn it to the right and now you can see you can see Christ manifested in this in this in the cloud the Angels amen you can see the the Angels wings and um the all four beasts and everything now so let's look at what they're saying about him plagiarizing running out and in the first seal he said and at the end of the Pentecost age we're supposed to receive according to the word of God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that would take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the ratering of the church now I I think that's really the key people say well he plagiarized Clarence Lin because Clarence Lin said a lot of the same things that brother Ram do he well in that same token you could say he plagiarized Martin Luther because Martin Luther preached justification and John Wesley preached sanctification but when brother brandom came on the scene he said hold on now it's not right brother Martin Luther to sit in a pub and smoke and drink beer and and uh John Wesley we've got to come on to the whether word is made manifest in you that the same that Christ is is living inside of you not just living a clean life but uh and uh so brother brand took took all the Loose Ends the little things all down through time that people had gotten uh even though maybe for the most part a lot of men had the right the right Doctrine and were almost in line but then brother B came along and said well you misplaced this here let's put this over here because that's and and everything ties in continuity so then you can look at the church ages and tie it with Daniel 70 weeks and tie Daniel 70 weeks with the Seven Seals and everything matches up into just a perfect harmonious picture and that's that's the key everything has to match up if it doesn't match up if you can look at any quote of brother Brands and say well it doesn't match up with this one over here it's not brother random it's it's your understanding just like the cloud you look at the cloud and say well I don't see I I don't see what I'm supposed to be seeing here and and he said turn it this way now now this is one that they they they say well uh Clarence Lin said that Matthew 24 was associated with the Seven Seals uh well okay so did um a commentary critical and explanatory in the whole Bible published in 1871 but the problem is they they knew that Matthew 24 was associated with the first six seals but they got the association and uh I have uh maybe after class if if you want it I I have the comparison between what Clarence Lin said and what this said okay I'll print it out for you and what brother brand said and brother brandom tied the script the verses in Matthew 24 perfectly with what the first six seals are but nobody else could do that so he came along behind the scenes and uh he came along after these brothers and and and tied together what they had gotten incorrect now the next they say Well Clarence Lin said he got the same dates this is off of the uh uh well that that brother that's speaking out he's got a he's got a a a website and this is what he has on his website that Clarence Lin has the exact same dates for the church ages that brother brandom has this is what he has on the website now is this true and a lot of these dates are are are just glaringly obvious like 312 um when Constantine ascended in Rome and came into power to 8606 when they when they crown the one of the Bishops uh uh Universal Bishop bonifus II the third was crowned Universal bishop and many of these dates well um let's see uh Martin Luther let's see Martin Luther put the 13 thesis on the on the I mean the how many was it 99 99 theses on the wiberg cathedral in 157 so his church really got started in 1520 and that's that's kind of where they arrive at these dates from a historical perspective they look at history and say well Claren Larin did we can we can group these dates together in such and such a way but now now now then brother Brandon said um this is this is the actual dates that Clarence Larin said he actually said 8070 is when the Ephesian Church age said started brother brand said the Ephesian Church age began in 853 when Paul started the Ephesian Church age and the uh the Clarence Lin said from 80 from 1750 to 188 1900 is when the uh Philadelphian Church age the dates for that but brother BR said the leosan church started onza Street April 9th 1909 when the Holy Spirit fell on isza street so uh my point is ROM came behind to tie up loose ends and if you say that uh he's getting this revelation we look at this in just a second he's getting uh these from somebody else well hold on just a second now uh as brother Brandon brought these dates and expounded them in the in the Tabernacle in the back of the Tabernacle it was Vindicated a light showing on the back and that's you know proving that it went down through all seven seven ages proving that what what his word said was true what he was saying was true so but now Clarence Len put dates but only brother brandham could put names to the ages and nobody else could do that and uh the reason that that Clarence lockin didn't do that is because that Clarence lockin preached that the Seven Stars in uh the redeemer's hand were not Messengers but they were the minist the five-fold ministry in each age or in each church so uh you say well well brother Ren's getting everything from somebody else but he didn't get this from somebody else brother so uh I should have put brother Brown I think I was copying that from the website Ephesian Church let's see so he he put all these these names to each Church age which we we're famili with and then now they say um that brother Brandon put names to each Church age so that he could put his own name at the last Church age that's what they're I'm I'm not presenting this to to um to fight them or because you know brother Brandon when he when he was speaking to the 17 religions in India he said I'm not trying to get you to see things my way but when they saw the eyes of the blind man open they saw the power of God then they they saw things that way but I'm I'm just trying to since uh you know when you see little sheep being led astray and things that's really my motivation the in the Ephesian church he said and the angel of the church of L I see is not known yet it will be someday but perhaps he on Earth he that has an ear know this is the age we're living in God will do the judging of that so he he never he never uh just came right out and said that I am the Messenger and questions and answers 1961 I believe that it's to be a man it'll be somebody after me but this message that I'm preaching is the true message of this day and it's the last message you see what I'm doing brother I'm putting you all the same place I am because you're just as much into it as I am you are messengers of this same message but anyway you can see what people are doing they're bending the truth a little bit saying that he put himself he put his own self as the last Church age messenger which um I mean I believe he was amen but he he didn't say I am Church M and then uh so I want to look at some of the things that we got like two minutes some of the things that Clarence Lin actually said and see what uh how it Compares and this is what Clarence Lin said about the Ephesian Church age and I just want to point out that this is all Clarence Lin said about the church age everything that he wrote can fit I can fit on one slide so you say well brother brandom got all of this huge expanse you think he's got this huge V that Clarence Len wrote books and books which he did but you can't say that brother brandom got all of this stuff that that he wrote about all the all the things tied everything together from one slide that Clarence Lin wrote and and so Clarence Larin wrote that is character seen its very first name for ephus means to go let go to relax that had become a backsliding church they say that's one of the things that brother brand plagiarize the character of the church is at Ephesus is a fair outline of the church period from 870 to 8170 and and that's another thing that they that they say he plagiarized those dates and and some of the other little details in here and and this is another thing that they say he PLU eyes the first seal this is now again this is everything Clarence Larin said about the first seal and I'm just going to be real quick when the lamb broke the first seal the first or lionlike living creature CED with a voice of thunder come the words and see are a many many manuscripts and in the revised version John had no need to come for he was already there the command then of come was to the riter of the White Horse I see what Clarence Len is saying he's saying that the Revelation was going to be to revealed to the rider not to John so brother R's not getting this Revelation from from Clarence L now some of these other things are are are correct you know moving along that the white horse rider was the Antichrist and so forth but now what about when when Clarence lgan saw that white horse rider riding away did he get a revelation of one God because Clarence ler remained a TR a trinitarian who went out to meet that Rider what Beast was it was it was it the word the lon that he he never says anything about that when did the Rider ride out cuz he puts him over in the after the Rapture that uh during that last seven years of of Daniel 70 weeks that uh then the writer begins to write out what about justification do you see that you're white white righteous church but what about uh all these different other parts of of Revelations the scene in heaven what kind of scene is being displayed here what about the what is the Father's throne and all these things that uh go beyond anything that Clarence Larin wrote just uh Way Beyond and this is all that moving through the real quick through the other seals the second seal this is all that he wrote about the second seal what about the false prophet sanctification any reference to the pope and this is everything that Clarence Len wrote about the seventh seal and he wrote some good good points in there about the silence and facing heaven but he never wrote about personal Revelation about uh the all the Mysteries being tied up in the last Church age the um and all the different things that brother R spoke about the three-fold purpose of his coming that God will be manifested in in first in his his son and his people and
