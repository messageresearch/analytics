«  229       †          Just think of it. Is there two Eternal Lifes? You couldn't answer that, could you? There is one Eternal Life, and that's the Life of God. This other kind of life, no matter what it is, it's got an end to it. And anything that had a beginning has an end. But anything that had no beginning has no end. And God said He would give us Eternal Life, without beginning, we were just made a part of Him. And actually the Life that's in us, wasn't brought here by human nature. Nature give us a spirit, but that spirit died, and we got the Spirit of God. Glory to God!
230    Was God a man? Certainly. "Let us make man in our own image." What was God? A theophany, a body. And there man was made like that and put over the garden. But there was no man to till the soil, in the senses. Then He created man out of the dust of earth, in the animal life, and that man tilled the soil. And the man fell, by transgression. Correctly. And God, the theophany, come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us, to redeem the man.

«  50       †        And then no doubt in my mind, but that's what Jesus had in His mind when He was here on earth, was that infallibility of God's eternal Word. For we know that in Him dwelt the Fullness of the Godhead Body. The entire Godhead was in Him. He was both Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but dwelt in a human form; the theophany of God, the great image of God that He made man in, then placed him in the earth... He had a body. God isn't without a body. God's got a body, and it looks like a man. Moses saw it; others saw it, and it looks like a man.

the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever I love that scripture because it's talking about the Word of God that's where we're at okay Hebrews 10 5 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make the comers darn to perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged should have no more conscience of sin you know we have gotten in trouble I guess you called it with a lot of the ministers of the message today because we've always made one stand in this that the Old Testament people there's a Salvation there forum there was a place for him to go to when they died all those things but there was no way they could receive the new birth there was no way they could receive eternal life this scripture shows you because if it had they wouldn't made those offering huh and see we don't think and and want to take the scriptures to see you know what we're doing we want our ideas well I just don't see that well that's alright go ahead for the wouldn't then verse 2 would they have not would they not how ceased to be offered because the worst were once purged should have no more conscience of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made us sins every year where it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins so it can't do it alright we're for when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offerings I would it's not but a body thou hast prepared me you may be seated the Lord to have his way with the reading of the word and for us into the understanding we tried to bring a message there Sunday and you know we'll pick up on that in this to really be a I guess you called it almost total repeat but it's because I want you to understand what we're trying to say and the way we're trying to bring things we're talking about the stature of a perfect man all right and we've got through and it's covered a lot of the things where the Prophet shows that the new birth faith you must have faith to be born again you can't add these virtues until you get faith you can't come to and climb up the the pyramid until you first start at faith bringing the new birth or were you know that we should do it and and that new birth is a very very valuable thing because as I was ending up and I'll repeat it in the message that you know the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings God in you makes it Christ in you the hope of glory brings you eternal life in your soul brings it to the position that God is living in you all right but the main thing now right now is I'm trying to make a point to where when we do start with the virtues and talking about what each one is and what it is and that works and things then we won't have to back up so far to cover things we try to get them into enough to give us understanding that then we can just say things and move on in the Lord all right but we we covered this past Sunday you know in the message that I really enjoy brother Forney Wednesday night you've done a good job and appreciate him you know but we were talking about how that the new birth no this was the point then and we'll pick it up the new birth brings you eternal life into your soul all right but it doesn't bring eternal life into the body or spirit that will take the end time and that's worth it that God has given us the the message to understand how and were and what and all is to transpire in this day and what a wonderful thing it is to have the truth to be revealed to us but to see that we're not born again in our body we're not born again in their spirit we're born again in our soul all right now here's the point of the day so listen and you'll see it this morning this afternoon the new birth makes that soul eternal okay that's the dwelling place of God we should have known that in the Baptist Church the method I mean where we come from we at least taught a little bit about it and we talked about that the bright OGIS are the church back then we didn't know to call it bright but we called it church that the church was the body of Jesus Christ all right and sees in that church by being the body of Christ God comes and lives in these bodies okay and he gives eternal life to that soul so I bury you and can cover that and that's what we were covering about the tabernacle of God all right see then eternal life comes into the soul but that's not the finish all right because there were many parts in the Old Testament to bring forth the tabernacle it kept advancing as we'll review in a second it kept coming forth from this to this to this for God could come and dwell in in in Jesus Christ and the human flesh and then give away that then it could start in you and I all right see then the tabernacle of God sure the new birth the born-again experience brings God into you and I makes us the body of Christ all right but it's not finished just because you get the new birth because we still have a body in spirit to deal with all right now in the Old Testament the tabernacle was annihilated right now follow the point of what I say in Sunday see Moses built the tent after what God gave him the pattern in heaven and he built the tent the tabernacle of God you know the skins and the things all right that stayed in existence until Solomon Solomon then you know come in to making because David couldn't do it we know the story but he provided everything for Solomon his son to to bring forth a temple or a tabernacle all right see then there was no more use of the tent you know the badger skins etc the thing so it was taken out of the way I don't know what they done with it if it depend me I would have probably tried to store it in a good place to just make it an antique when you or something that would be valuable to keep because it was the dwelling place of God because when that when Moses finished that God proved that he was happy with it because he come behind the veil right he come behind the veil they could have even Minister they couldn't do he came behind the veil of the inner veil part of the tabernacle or tent that Moses had made all right but see then when Solomon came into being building the tabernacle you know there see then it lasted for a long time and it was destroyed right but then it had to be restored and that's why I was bringing out I hope you caught that point that restoration is more valuable than we think we talked about that were to breathe to the faith of the fathers to this that or the other and then say well well we just don't see this don't see that it's more valuable for restoration that it is infer for what you start with you said well where's that at all right according to I believe it what is it Hagee I were that the latter house was more marvelous than the former our first house in other words Solomon and all of his beauty when it come to this restoration of the natural temple right then the restoration of the natural temple said the the glory of the latter house was more wonderful one because it was restoration in like I told you they they didn't Solomon you know everything was so perfect not the sound of a bus or anything sawing or what everything was done over here somewhere and then transported and brought in and all those stones placed in place and not not even a bit of hammering around or doing everything was so perfect you didn't have to chisel it down make it fit I'm going to come out to make a wonderful beautiful temple but why then would the Bible say that the latter house is more beautiful why would it say that when when Solomon and his great beauty of what he done when what they done in the latter house they just took a lot of the stones and just put them back in you know this made of walls and made this and made what they could they didn't go back and review all of this and make all of this back into they just had to use what they had and it was placed back in together sure they had to bring some stones and make them in shape them and everything else but the point what I'm getting at see why would it say the latter house because it was restoration restoration is more valuable then than it is to say what you start with if you restore something a you know it's greater than what you have in the beginning right some of you want to buy a good a model you've got about 50,000 bucks or something or $100,000 you can buy an a model one because it's been restored restoration it's a whole lot more valuable than what's the point I was trying to get you to see Sunday that the latter house what didn't where Jesus came in and the temple was there and all of the things the Bible said that was greater than all the other code it would be restoration season it wound up that was destroyed and that was destroyed after Christ and watch the overlap to her they were so beautiful that she had Christ there can't you just see those Jews no wonder they couldn't understand because you know what they could stand and look at that temple and Jesus was talking about his own self right he was talking about himself even to work destroy this temple they said you mean you're gonna tear down in this temple and all you gonna do that he was talking about his own body and what about see the reason the Jews couldn't accept him because he was supposed to be in behind the veil according to their understanding he wasn't supposed to be out there talking are you following me I'm trying to get you to see what restoration means to you if you can follow it because we are to be restored back to the original faith that was once delivered to the Saints and that's more glorious than when it was brought because its restoration God is more pleased in the end times than he was back Dyer is what I'm trying to get you to see I'm trying to get you to see restoration as to restoring that what God is trying to do with you and I is to bring us back to that original faith and by bringing it back to that original faith it'll be a greater day well I just don't see nothing going on then you never will with that attitude you never will see anything that's going on because you're not looking at it the way it's supposed to be you're not looking at it the way God looks at it what if you'd have been able to bend back guard seen Solomon's Temple and seeing all of those huge stones and all of those great thing and then you seen that they had to restore that one day and they wasn't able to bring back all of that stuff that David brought in this that in the other they had to do the best they could I'm just making a point to you to where you look at restoration the faith of the fathers is more valuable to you than you could ever think about all right because that's what I'm talking about of the statue of a perfect man see the faith of the father's being restored the statue of a perfect man bringing it back brother Brennan said those disciples had these virtues well then if the latter house is to be greater than the former how much more would it be valuable today to understand and walk in the virtues and things that God could bring it into the church when don't say again what does that mean it's not dire because you don't see it I guess it means it's not in existence right let's see Church day and that's what I'm trying to drive the point to us restoration means more than what we could think about is to bring back the original faith in an hour and time when all mankind those disciples faced only the Pharisees and Sadducees and maybe one or two little fling all groups or something they didn't have but a couple of groups to face right but yet we're facing thousands of denominations and how many in this message and look how it's going now when the point is trying to get this the Prophet to bring the message to us to restore the original faith and the people of the message are destroying the message that the Prophet is brought see they're trying to tire the temple back down to him but this don't worry about it it's going to be there God's going to make it it may not be with a handful of people when he's gonna do it it's gonna be there I don't care what we think about it it's going to be there and you can doubt all you want to that's what I said people are saying well I just don't if we think we've got what we've got what we were to be doing this out the other and I told you because I pointed out and looked that day I said I'm looking at the reason that it ain't happening because you're not believing it you're not believing it now the Lord willing it'll be next Sunday cause brother Bob is like but I pray that you'll be here next Sunday or at least listen because I'm gonna try to lay it down hard and strong of what I've been saying all along so next week will be a very valuable thing you know so make sure you either get the tape or are you here to listen if you can because I want to try to make it hard and strong but to show what God has been a doing and he's doing it now see we're looking for things to take place well often wonder see we're looking for this we're looking for that how long did it take to make the temple I never looked it up to see but the Bible says forty and nine years in the building of the you know it is forty-six correctly and then the three to finish the outside and the forty and nine years everyday they got up what we're gonna do today we're gonna put that stone in play we're gonna do this we're gonna do that what we do yesterday we put that stone in play but what we're gonna do tomorrow we're gonna put that one here what are we gonna do the next day we're gonna put one more here your are you listening it wasn't a great glorious time that they were hollered oh we're building the temple of God we're making a doctor sweating working day in and day out for 49 years and then you come up with an idea of saying now I don't see nothing going on even the breath you breathe it's a mighty marvelous thing of God and His glory I think don't sing you don't breathe stop try that but see that's where we're not looking at it in the serious matter we're looking at it in our parts we think we're supposed to have this or how that or have that show me in the Bible we're supposed to be come on I've taught it over and over I don't love to worry about it I've been teaching in 50 years I ain't worried about it I've always looked for a revival but us never been a revival like the world has talked about and it's not a revival like the believers in this messy talking about I'm talking about a revival of God word a restoration of God's Word to bring back God among the people that's the revival I'm talking about not a world wide sweeping revival not all of this out of the other that's to the Jews but see to gradually day-by-day grow in grace and knowledge and be able to stand when everything else is falling look at them that may be the people that brought you into the message may be the people that brought you into the message and you look at them now where are they tearing the message down instead of trying to put the temple together their time they're trying to tie it apart but do you understand what I'm saying when those Jews put that temple back together god looked down and he came again read the Bible he came into tent and they couldn't even minister he came when there Solomon got it ready he couldn't minister go and read us in Haggai on through there the different places when they restored the temple God came down into that temple all he needs is for me and you to get the temple ready for him he'll do the coming when we try to make this happen or that happen and then we look at it and say I just don't see nothing would you have seen anything if you'd have been down in Egypt and day by day you was walking in God's Word 40 years they walked in God's work brother Daniel what do you mean I mean it was a promise they'd be down there that long that was God's Word but how would you felt when you was a slave and being beat and killed and kicked around and everything every day you wouldn't I thought you was in the Word of God you wouldn't thought you were being fulfilling the Word of God do we look at the glory we look at the day of the end and we see a glory of something happening but we don't see 49 years and building the temple before God could come into it till we run our own thousand I did I don't see nothing going on if we had these great signs and wonders I could believe God is with us or you're a good example you're a good candidate for the devil in his days and hours well I just why don't you just go home and forget it he said what I don't know what let's go home and go somewheres else and forget it I'm not against anybody I don't want to run nobody out I'm trying my best Emil you and I to it to a place where we can take the punishment and live in the time when everything else is going against it till all even the people like I said the people that brought you into the message go back and think of some of those churches you were in and and what they've done since that time it's the church we don't look at it like a we want this great glory we wanted right there is a time when that transpires but remember the point God came down in that tent and lived in it his presence was with the children of Israel as they journeyed through the land Solomon build him a temple and he settled on us reading there this morning just looking at Solomon's he built that temple he built a place for God to dwell and God told him said I've been all of this I've been up and down you don't have to do these things for me because I've been happy to dwell among you richly Bible but he said in other words like I tried to proclaim that proclaim Sunday God was simply saying all right all right you want to do this I'll let you build this I'll let you build this tent to Moses what you see we don't look at it the way that God do it you realize read your Bible do you realize that Moses was told taken up into heaven and showing what to bill you remember me trying to explain that Sunday was he took up our shoulder board over here in a border with our put this board that I put this 10 time which is coming to our DDC Jesus Christ which did he see did you see Almighty God or did you see a bunch of tents and he was looking at one thing everybody else looking at something held that lie stood until Solomon came forth and then when it did it was dismantled are set aside as you want to call it Solomon built a house read it and along in the scripture there to where he was talking God to mankind I don't need this I've been happy to dwell among you but you've got it in your heart David that was what was so glorious David got in his heart he wanted to build God a temple he said I live in a house of Cedars and things he said God has to dwell out you're an emptiness that I'm cool the wind blowing through sand he's out after the hot Sun that stirred God's heart he said okay David you couldn't do it we said all that saw them and do it but David set out Solomon never had to do anything Solomon all he had to do was a symbol because David had everything ready David he could have said well okay I'll just go live and have a good time forget it no he said outright as quick as he's knew that he would not even be able to restore the temple itself he set out to set aside everything get this get that bring all together because I want you to go and read your Bible sometime find where Solomon was told of God how to build a tent I mean the the tabernacle short to me God told Moses how to do it right come on when Solomon picks up its the inter the things that was in there that God deals with Solomon he doesn't deal with him Moses he tells him how big how long what to do Solomon he doesn't tell him that you know why because you wouldn't listen and Sunday to what I was talking about so when Moses when Moses was told of God you want to do this I'll let you do it I don't have to have these things but if you want to build it I'll take you up here and show you how to do it and he's shouting Jesus Christ it's like we talked about that the the pyramid is some Bible and stone right and when it come forth Moses put it all into two words do this build that make this bill that come over into Solomon and see where if you find him telling him that God telling him how to do it he didn't have to he done told something Moses what to build Solomon just put into a different manifestation our parts you know what God had told Moses to build Moses was taken up in the Mount remember and shown there in the mouth while he was up there 240 days getting his riding and that's when God told him how to build it in you know the Tabernacle in the wilderness was show me where Solomon was taken up to show he didn't have to be the prophet Moses had already brought the banner of how to do it that's why you can't compare the tent that was laid out because it was this that and the other and then Solomon coming in and building all that up but Solomon was building the same thing in stone and and other things that Moses was told in heaven he didn't have to go to heaven it was restoration it was restoring our bringing forth into a different manner of God manifesting himself but finally that temple was torn down right but then when it was tore down they started again read over there were even like a heathen king he would know jew-- when those men come in and told him you know I want to go back and build my house he said you take anything I've got I'll just send a word ahead of you he got on his email and he said I had a thing to all the whole his country and said you give him anything he wants they didn't have to buy nothing that teeing supplied everything that would take to restore that temple don't you think he might get eternal life but understand what I'm trying to drive that then when that temple was finished God came the third time code he came in Moses and they couldn't minister he came in Solomon and they couldn't minister he comes again and they said it couldn't even Minister because of his presence but get back to the point as tall now that's why those Jews couldn't follow it they couldn't follow it because they thought God was behind the veil right where did the Jews thank God was come on he was behind the veil right they didn't know he'd left paddy left come on you just can't understand God in those ways because remember God can deal the way he wants to it always surprised me too brother around him to say God was still dealing with Israel forty years after Calvary we thought immediately Calvary cut off it dude and that's it uh-uh God was still dealing with Israel forty years later now that's what your prophet said that's what brother Brent says things that's hard for mankind to follow would you understand here's a man walking I've talked to claiming to be the God of glory you're a man making yourself caught and here he was preaching to him day in and day out and they said we don't believe you because if we hear of anything it'll be from behind a veil and said we don't right now have too many prophets that can go behind our because remember they have kind of got under control of the Romans you know and it's people all right what are you getting me God walks among mankind he's done gone from behind a veil come out into the original veil that he wanted you remember Sunday me trying to explain that what was God's original veil what was it before time ever begun you don't believe God had a body well I just don't believe God had a body back then well why did he have no why can't you say he had a body don't you think he had a place to dwell come on be serious well I do I just don't think he had a body go to random city did he called it a theophany yeah and things like that but he said it was a body he said God is not without a body he said he's not like the wind remember we've been through all of these things you ordered listen but those Jews couldn't understand that dar was the god of glory standing outside and they were saying no he's back to her he stood back to her if we can ever find this and get it right to where we get through to go behind there we'll find out some old cause behind ours where we find it from our and I listened our God does send a prophet now is that right that's where we don't follow the message in the Bible you know Jews the Jews was looking forward you know the Jews right today believe that Elijah will precede the coming Messiah come on get serious and you're thinking they believe that the Messiah can't come until the Prophet comes on the scene they believe Elijah will come that guy that was was there with us he we sat down we talked see they believe that Elijah is gonna come and precede the coming Messiah but they don't see that he was to come through the Gentiles and the time they believe he was to be a Jew you know those Jews believe actually Elijah will be able to tell them right where to put the temple and when they finished the temple then the Messiah's coming come on they're in the Thames they're not like us playing around well I don't know worth anything going on and on I just don't see nothing it's just it's just a bad day and it's horrible why was the other phone he says well he was he was but do you understand what I'm getting at what if you was a Jew and Jesus come up declaring himself to be God you'd say get behind the veil and I'll listen to you right you spoke to be back tyre you ain't supposed to be out here come on are you with me those Jews were thinking God was behind the veil but he doesn't walk from behind the veil and become into human flesh to the dwelling place of Almighty God which would be a body not a temple not a tabernacle but would be a body that God could come and dwell in what's that not who he was was he not the body of Almighty God all right Church then why can't we will see it see then the bride of Jesus Christ is that body we are the body of Christ that's what I'm trying to get across we are the body of Christ that's why he's not here in a corporal body because it would be contrary to Scripture see they thought he was back there and him saying he was out here he wasn't back there God wasn't behind the veil he had stepped out from behind the veil and coming to human flesh they said we won't anything God will go behind the veil we'll get a profit we'll do this we'll do that and there he stood in the body that he had brought into being to where he could live in you think well God brother Dale you you you seem to try to make it that God is a man I didn't try to make it God made it that way I didn't say it the prophets when it said it I didn't write the Bible let us make man in our own image our own likeness and let them have dominion over there I didn't write the book I didn't write in him dwelt a fullness of the Godhead bodily and I surely didn't finish the book up as the Prophet saying the bride is the fullness of the Godhead bodily she's his body right now that's why we don't he don't come to earth in a physical form well brother branham was garden we'll see then you done broke his scriptures because you got him in a bodily form he don't come in a bodily form we meet him in the air right at this present time where's he at the body is sitting on the throne revelations right for the body is on the throne but we are his body the bride of Jesus Christ is the body of Almighty God come on is that what your prophet had to say about it I mean it do you want me to read that we're his body come on how about reading this season's one 22 and 23 the church is the body the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all seasons 5 and 31 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones it hurts don't you understand what we're here for don't you understand what a purpose for us to be God wanted to live in a human flesh he didn't want to live in a tent he said I'd build them come on you remember Sunday we're talking about God was saying back to the empathy if I needed that I'd build it out of pure gold I'd make it yeah you know I mean I'd build a great bit I wouldn't be building all this stuff out here it wouldn't be no tent luring around it being our condition building might have the wind coming since emotional in meetings from COO but he said you're wanting to do it you're wanting to build me a body so go ahead go ahead Moses make it like this Moses made it Solomon picked it up and made it and put it into stone what Moses had ins in skins and things as all we're speaking of Jesus Christ every stone in that building was speaking of Christ everything that they done was speaking of Christ would you see that had to be running along as I said if he was listening that's the only time God and his temple that man had provided was there together are you listening when Jesus Christ walked on this earth they had that holy of holies right there right and they believed God was in that holy of holies right because the temple had been restored it had been brought back Jesus come out turn talk to him about it said you know he said restore this tear this down now build it back and read it they said what do you mean you gonna build this back through that and with 40 in nine years it's 49 years building in weight went through all of that showing how that took all of that 49 years of restoration it's not talking about the fact of motive Solomon how long it took or Moses how long it took it was the restoration restoration is more valuable than you think restoration means to bring back into the original form of what you had in the beginning that's restoration restoration was not God building and doing this over here and making it that away and then he gots to come over here and build something different that's what I tried to get you to see Sunday church God showed Moses how to build it Solomon wasn't told how to build it why because he followed Moses you're listening that's a very valuable point and thought Moses had already said what to do Solomon just moved it over in a different form and made it different Moses was told how to build a tent in the tabernacle and exactly Eden was shown how to make a pyramid what was they both doing making God in forms to word that he could be seen or where he was living with when it come down to him walking upon the shores of Galilee there was the very God of glory Israel could not understand how their God had left them behind the veil they couldn't follow that their guard was behind the veil if God had walked from behind the veil because he had stepped into human flesh which was the body he wanted now listen for a second before we read something God was not going to just build a people he wanted the people he could live in he had his own body remember what I wasn't saying on another day he said hold it if I wanted to build this I'd build it right see he's the one that built the body of Jesus Christ the way he wanted it there in Jesus Christ was Almighty God in human flesh but see in that same body was the pride of Jesus Christ waiting not physically talking come on God didn't want to just build a Tim build a body that he could come down and dwell with man he wanted to build a body that he could come down yes and dwell with man but then he knew the rest of the story that he was a healer or a savior or deliverer he wanted to come down and live in man why because he knew that she would be his body he knew that when he died the life would come out of him and go into the body you know the bride and to marry her forth as his body but that his flesh body would go through the throne and wait on the throne until witness is finished when this is finished on earth then we meet him in the air he raises and comes us away and we meet him in the air he didn't just want to just build a body for him to come and dwell in he wanted her body he could ground him but he wanted a body of people that he could dwell in that we would be his body 3:15 Philadelphian George but what is the temple of God Jesus spoke of his body as being the temple it was it was the temple of God but now that we are his body the true church is the temple of God by the Holy Ghost within us come on we are his body the page is unstuck taken from the statue of a perfect man this is number 5 what is the tabernacle now a body God tabernacling in a body then God was made flesh and dwelt among us in the form of Jesus Christ his son his creation then he become a dwelling place for God the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us changes our nature by sitting upon us the Holy Ghost then we become into the divine nature of God then we become a dwelling place for God are you in come on look at this Ed forgot 75 look what is there know how that God is in his church the church is now supposed to be taking the place of God carrying on his ministry we don't need a body he's dwelling in you and me the new birth brings him into you and me but now here is the finish to come into this evening his message see it's not all to just become born again he wants his divine nature to come in to ever individual his divine nature is the statue of a perfect man it starts with the new birth come on we'll get to it this afternoon statue of a perfect man Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got all these verts are sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place now this is a house that God dwells not a building with a big Bell on the top of it and a high steeple but a body has now prepared me a body that God can dwell in can walk in can see in can talk in can work in a men living instrumentality of God and God walking on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteous in ordered of the Lord come on attach to a perfect man 361 then the word coming from here manifests itself through each one of these beings see and makes his complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are because his life is in here they are in Christ come on what is it building the tabernacle building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place the perfect man the living tabernacle of the Living God where he dwells the moons keep on reading and that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church paragraph 140 which would be number 9 how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many here like to be that the dwelling place of the Living God we're not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the powerhouse I am the dwelling place of the Spirit by His Word 3:41 then God lives in a tabernacle called a building the living tabernacle of the Living God's dwelling place we are his body he doesn't need a body right now on earth rota Brown says you got the body he said people who say I got blood I got this remember he said if you got the body you broke ever Scripture in the Bible come on cuz they were talking about literal things like blood and like things he said if you've got that you broke every script why cause we're his body he's not coming to earth he's going we're going to meet him in the air why because he would have two bodies God don't have two bodies he's got one body he said wait a minute God's got a body we got no no that's where you're looking at it wrong God came down and dwelled in a body and made way that you and I could have that same body why cause the Bible said that we'd have a glorious body white like unto his Lac unto his body what about a group of people walking on earth is God in human flesh see the new birth makes now we'll get to seen the new birth makes him a body to live in because he's living in you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right but to make it complete on earth he's got to come through these virtues to bring his divine nature into that human or that part body that will have eternal life the float and let that come out wordly into human flesh a dwelling place for God well I'll tell you what boy you really might eat that now because I can't even find this that you're talking about not sure think don't think that we could be the dwelling place of God will you tell me who is or what is or worriers or what's he doing you realize now listen this is the life statement I hope you get you realize if we're not the body of Christ on earth then he has no body on earth you don't listen come on he has nobody on earth because his body's on the throne that's according to the book now the book says that the Bible that his body is on the throne and that Bible says that we meet him in the air and you know what when we meet him in the air we've already been glorified all body spirit and soul to meet him in the air because that's the only way we can do it are you listening bodily form is what a title the message bodily form God forming himself in you and I the stature of a perfect man will bring his very nature he's being and all down into a human body that can bring that body under subjection no no no we can't never come under subject ours where he said now listen only in this with this statement you know God ain't expecting us to do anything now you you're gonna have to listen for a minute God's not expecting you and I to do anything except die to ourselves and let him come and live in us are you with me all he wants us to do is to get out of the way and let him come in set that way I can't do it I agree with you but if Christ can come and live in us he can manifest it outwardly and there's where you start your being of that body because that's your body your theophany your body your soul of what you are it's on the inside and all we got to do is get him outside but we're never going to get him outside being so beautiful well I don't see nothing I was thinking there this week Ryan dismay'd a little testimony there Wednesday night and then you know I don't talk lilulu testimony I mean he made our testimony about God in his ways I don't know where you listened to what he was saying he said that baby said it had seizures and he said we was expecting it we knew it would have seizures you know there was expecting not expecting like waiting on it to happen but what did he say so when she had the seizure and he prayed for he just walked off the platform I thought my goodness man he just got to the point to telling us what God was doing and you did walking off get back up here testify for an hour and a half come on because what he was simply saying was she's alive she's here God had delivered her and he he didn't put that in words he just walked off and left what God has done among us in this day is enough without having what he done with the Prophet and the things that was to his ministry and all of those things the things this little church has seen transpire well they they got it right over there - I like what brother faughn he said that brother Tim Humes his dad which was a wonderful old man I met got to meet him they were wonderful and he said that you remember if I can get it there's an executive anyhow brother Tim's they asked his daddy you know something about it he said how could you tell the difference between anointed ones and brother branham he said because you fathered that gift in other words the others could only come so far I'm getting in the best words I can they could only come so far because their anointing ones with our was in him there in him was God to manifest his death but you know what that was an example for you and I no no I know you you expect us to I don't expect us to do anything greater than he done I don't expect us to do anything greater than Jesus done but I expect us to do more oh you remember greater greater would mean we're doing something he couldn't do but more means he's come in to us to do what he wants to do come on because we're his body now can you hold on for a second then how does the seed come the natural birth of a child how does the seed come it has to come from the male right come on am i right the seed comes from the one no mayo why is it brother branham said that if you get anything you got to go to the body how come they couldn't get over that in the scriptures and getting it to working right in the book of Acts and they sent for a couple of guys that was original and when they got there it worked why because it was coming from the body maybe you'll see what we're talking about maybe next weekend when we get to that because the seed has got to come through the body and see if it comes to the body then you may have to worry about it being messed up if that seed comes through the body has come to them too right so there's gonna be the Bride of Christ come on musicians bodily form how do you get born again faith cometh by hearing your incomes by somebody preaching somebody bringing the word but I'm asking you this question before next Sunday can you put everything you've got I'm asking you now can you put everything you've got in all the hopes you'll ever have on the fivefold ministry you got a week to think it over can you put everything you've got on the five for ministry no I'll put everything I got on brother branham according to the Bible according to the Prophet the five whole ministries for the perfecting of the saints ain't gonna depend on nobody I've got it straight from the Prophet according to the Bible you just lied is that plain enough according to the Bible you just lied because the Bible doesn't teach that the Bible teaches is downward coming what God brought the word on earth himself decent of man brother branham come his restoration back to the word but who's going to be the word who's going to be the word I didn't get a clapping hand on that sounding like I got a clout back there for somebody doing something wrong well rid of God anyway come on George let Stan do you understand what I'm getting at I'm trying to get you to see who you are and what your purpose is of being here somebody is going to have to be it why can't we believe that we're that but you'll never get anywhere will you wowsie wowsie woo I just don't see nobody with it I hope you listen to what I say it 49 years in building the temple and every day they move stones and they worked and slaved and done and they're all walking around I don't see nothing going on except we're building this some kind of a building we don't even know what it looks like yet the church that's where we're missing it because when the building was finished was when the Shekinah glory comes when this statue of a perfect man brother Brennan said it I didn't he said it when it builds itself up into here he said the true baptism of the Holy Ghost if you read statue of a perfect man you might order to go back and read it again because if you'll read about half way through all the rest of the message you'll see him emphasizing over and over and over a statue of a perfect man when it's completed will be the one that goes in the rapture whoa what do you mean brother Dale oh oh boy to get believers go hey man I hope you're right there yeah all born-again believers Oh rapture so evidently brother Brennan must have been talking about something about the rapture a little different than our thoughts of rapture maybe he's talking about the one the Bible says that you will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye there's a part of the rapture that you and I that are alive are going to have to experience here it's not D Christianizing all of those that have died and went on come on it's bringing it to the right place what do we got I can face to my bodily form [Music] it kept coming until he got what he wanted was a body to live in retrospect the father created that body according to the prophets message masterpiece the prophets milk that bodies the prophets wrote that body into being the world now you'll understand why I said Moses were told how to build it Solomon didn't have to be told he listened to Moses he could look out there in the shadows of the word he would build it the temple he could look at that tabernacle of Moses at beyond you're not paying attention [Music] Solomon looked after big but he bailed over here what had come forth and his understanding he never built its hidden endeavor that [Music] and one day that body was on earth that God could dwell in a human body but that wasn't all of it [Music] he wanted a bride that would be his body [Music] wake up jerk welcome to see what's taking place [Music] he holds my future and life is worth the living we call healing because healing I [Music] can face the coutny antibody delivers I have a body to live in he brought his body under subjection [Music] that's all he wants me and you to be it's come under subjection to that one that's within us is that a hard thing to do it is if we try to do it ourselves but it's not if we let him do it let him come innocently all I can face tomorrow be all it's gon be all I know he holds Church I hope you caught on the one a sayin Moses went to heaven and got the picture of what to do Solomon didn't have to go all he had to do was follow Moses and look and he said Darius he built it like that but it won't do no good for me to build a copycat or a picture over here to look like that he said I'm gonna put what's in my heart I'm gonna put what's in my heart over here cause Moses put what was in his heart over there they always build in the body everything had to match exactly then you take it you know you pull that pyramid and put it over there's exactly the same thing father we've tried there just helped us go with us now as we the natural meal and just Lord bring us back this afternoon and guide us and help us be with all those traveling take care of them give everybody a safe journey may we all be together in you in you as one that we can truly be your body thank you lord have your way in Jesus name you're dismissed [Music] and this life is worth in cars Oh [Music] walking face tomorrow because he laid my fears they're gone [Music] because I know I know he holds the future and life is worth living just because he lives because [Music] oh I can face tomorrow [Music] because he lay Oh fear is gone because I know oh yes I know he knows my future and life is worth the living just because he lives [Music] oh my fears there
