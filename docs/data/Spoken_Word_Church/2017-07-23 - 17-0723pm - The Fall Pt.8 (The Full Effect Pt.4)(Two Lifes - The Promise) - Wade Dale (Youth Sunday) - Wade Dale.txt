«  E-22       †        Let's close our eyes to our imaginations for a few moments and go way back into the--'fore there was anything. The great fountain of all eternity was that spirit of love, joy, that spirit of honesty, that spirit of trueness in this perfection. And then out of the existence of the Father went the Logos which was the Son, which was the theophany, which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a celestial Body. That's the Logos. The Word spoke out of them great Fountains of Life and went forth. And there was the theophany, which was God made into Word.
«  E-23       †        Then that theophany was made flesh in the Person Christ Jesus. And then all the fullness of the Trinity dwelt in Him, both Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, all in that. And that's the very way we go, plumb back to the original beginning of God. There we are borned again not of flesh, borned again not of blood, but borned again by the Spirit. And in that eternal Spirit of love and honesty comes down to make Its place in us.
And then when we die from this life, we go into the body which... If this earthly tabernacle is dissolved, we have a theophany to go into, a body celestial.
Then at the coming of the Lord Jesus, this body is picked from the earth again and made in a glorified state to live in His Presence forever. Then all the perversion, all the things that was in--in the perversion all goes out of existence. Flesh goes to its punishment. Hell opens up her mouth and swallows in all the evil and the perversion. And God and His beloved Church, His Bride, takes their stand for the eternities to roll on. That's the great hope of the Christian Church.

«  228       †          But, look, there's only one Eternal Life, and that's God. And if you're going to be tormented forever, and can never die, you got Eternal Life. You can't be tormented forever... You may ...

sweetheart she's special to me good to be in the house of the Lord now we're going to talk about somebody's real special we're gonna talk about the Lord Jesus Christ and man let's turn it in the Bible to the book of Genesis and it looks like me and brother Dale can't get out of the book of Genesis but that's ok it's alright it's where everything began so we're going to be genesis 3:15 today we're still talking about the fall the full effects of the fall to life and now we're going to talk about the promise because last week we kind of hit the at the end we talked about the promise there is a promise and the Bible says that God could swear by no other so he swore by himself he's going to do it we can't do it the devil can't do it the Angels can't do it but God is going to do it himself but he's going to do it through a group of people man he's not going to do it he is going to do it by yourself he's going to make sure this plan is carried out but he's going to carry it out through the bride of Jesus Christ hey man so we do have something to do with this man so let's bow our heads before we get started or Jesus we pray today Lord that you would come among us in a special way today you'd be the one Lord that does the speaking the revealing you'd be the one that today is our satisfying portion or that all things that are hindering us in our body and hindrance in our mind and hindering us in our work and all the things of life that we'll just lay it aside for a few minutes Lord and you speak to all of us Lord not just one person speak to everyone in the congregation thank you for bringing sister Bayo back with us Lord would sure appreciate that thank you very much special lady in our heart I pray that you'd bless her Lord give us strength just touch each one of us - Lord all of us are special in here we all are special people because we come I believe we come from you and that makes us real special Lord I pray that you'd be with us take care of us be with the missionaries Lord as they all are now preparing to - some still in the foreign field and some getting ready to come home here to be with the camp-meeting Lord just give them strength give them traveling mercy father we pray that you just be with the ones that are not with us today Lord take care of them it was a little bride all around the world father because we are truly the apple of your eye Lord we pray that you'd be with us and touch us now and cheese's name we pray amen genesis 3:15 now this is this is after the fall of what happened in the Garden of Eden between Adam and Eve and the Beast and this is what God is saying to Adam and Eve but what he's doing is he says to me is ringing out to Eternity because this is the eternal Word of God and this I in this scripture is God Almighty Himself not a prophet not a priest not a king this is God himself so that's what he says and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed now remember the promise is when we'll talk about in just a second a woman doesn't have a seat a man woman has to receive seed right the man has to seed so the woman's seed speaking of Jesus Christ that God would come in human flesh through the womb of a woman be given a seed by God and the sperm and the egg and produced the body of Jesus Christ a man and then what's that person going to do he's going to what he's going to wrap everything up bring it right back that's the promise all right I'll put enmity between the end woman between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now let's read acts 2:38 before we before we sit down because here is your promise then Peter said unto them repent not quit doing this don't do this don't do that repent repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call you may be seated in the Lord as blessing to the reading of the word now let's read Galatians 2:20 because we're talking about for you haven't been here the background a little bit on two lights now not two lives we're talking about two life's okay like brother Dale this morning bringing in two creations alright we're looking at two lights because what did Paul say he said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live which means he lived a previous life before that what y'all in Sunday school this morning thank you thank you well I told y'all in sun-tzu class what to do when we had booster and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of myself oh no that's not what he said he said I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Paul saying look it's nothing I've done it's nothing that is not me it's not I live he's already said that it's not islet live but Christ that liveth in me and the life I now live in other words I live the previous life contrary to the way I live now and then because as Christians we believe I believe one thing's for sure you have to have something new your old birth your old life is cankered nasty filthy dead and on its way to hell if you don't have the life of Christ inside of you then that's exactly where you're going there's no gray area there's no I'm a halfway Christian or I've got half of God in me or I've got some of God in me you either got all God or no God I believe in what saved always say but I believe once saved by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're always saved don't tell me you act like a devil all your life and then you gonna go to heaven I got quite loose were you thank you man that says truth but look the life which I now live I saw I saw my two lives we have one life that listen whatever you believe happened in the Garden of Eden there was a covenant that was before that God said if you eat of this this is what's going to happen right if you don't eat of this this is what's going to happen right then when what they did was is they broke that covenant he knew he knew man was going to break the Covenant Adam and he broke that covenant and now God had to bring another covenant in and but the Covenant came with a promise genesis 3:15 i will put enmity or in other words i'm going to put a division it's like I said before listen Adam didn't lose his relationship he was a son of God the Bible says he was a son of God amen he didn't lose his relationship I'm related to Samuel and Peggy Dale and I can't ever lose that but I lost my fellowship with God when I decided to go another direction we were talking about that back there a few minutes ago I decided to go another way in other words you can bring them a kid up in the way it should go absolutely and when it's older it'll come back but there is a time when I lived a different life I lived a life that that I knew that their God was nowhere to be seen that I that I decided that's the way I was going to live amen now listen we know God was with us we know that we know we had an angel with us we know we had something with us that helped us but I promise you one thing you're still a free moral agent that angel cannot influence you so much but so much you're a free moral agent because you can override that Eve overrode what God said hey man and did what she did all right but thou as we see that that fall coming in and we'll read it in just a minute that there had to be another life that we have to look for the first life light with even with Abel and Cain you look at Abel and Cain they made a sacrifice they had to have a sacrifice in other in other words they had to have a different life than just normal people same today today we have two life amen and I can say like Paul denai the life that I now live I didn't listen you know what I live by my own faith I live by my own rules before God came into my life hey man so I said before let's just break this thing down real good I was not born with any kind of eternal quality in this life show me one except that God before the foundation of the world saw that I would one day he would cross my path and that I would accept what he had now you didn't know that but he did he's all-knowing he knew that we crossed your path but he also knew that when he crossed the neighbors path they would reject him amen because remember we don't believe in predestination as that God had put you into a tube and he's going to pull you through that tube and that's the way it's going to be no listen that's not even a just God to do that all we are would be just Christian zombies pretty much least we'd be Christian zombies okay Lord what do I do no no no we have a free moral agency to do right or wrong even today a man period so predestination is easy if you got a person that knew what was going to happen before it happened now if you just got predestination of somebody that doesn't know anything until it happens you got a problem but when you've got a man called God because the season says those who lay what for knew he did predestinate a man so foreknowledge was first he knew before every person listened before the world was ever formed he knew you'd be sitting here today in fact if not then he's not my god if he didn't know whatever thought you're having at the moment he's not God he is in finite we are finite your thoughts remember a louder in heaven why because that's where they're at that all right but we had a promise because remember once we got across that chasm because if you look at the type in the Old Testament look in the Book of Luke I believe it is where you've got the rich young ruler dies and then you got Lazarus that dies and the rich young ruler is trying to get word where Lazarus is out and Lazarus is laying over there under a shade tree in the bosom of Abraham enjoying itself and he's over here the rich young ruler died he's in hell he's wanting a cup of water he's willing just some water on his fingertip and he asked Lazarus and Lazarus is look I can't go where you are and you can't go where I go why there was a great gulf the Bible said there was a division that what you know what separated their choice their choice on earth separated where they were at that moment nothing else but their choice because remember Jesus Christ died he came to this earth and died for every person on the face of this earth amen but he only but he knew who would accept him and who would not he did not just come down here and say well maybe somebody will feel sorry for me they'll make a movie about me called The Passion of the Christ and somebody might just get saved no that's not the way God works if he is all-knowing if he knew what your thought was going to be today before the foundation of the world absolutely he'll know what your beginning and your end is going to be amen that makes him in phonate we are finite you know I can see why God knew who all these kids were if you were infinite you'd know how many kids use going on because he's building this family if Genesis 1:26 man that we're talking about listen that's the pure family of God that we've been talking about and you can't have that old life and be in that family because remember your family traits go with you amen if you have those original traits of line and cheating and stealing and running around and drinking and smoking and cutting we can make a list listen the list is not a problem right the list is not the problem you know that's what we do I just read you that scripture where Peter said unto them repent the first thing we do is don't do this don't do that and only this but what we do is though we look at the characteristics or the attributes of that life and the attributes and characteristics characteristics of that life is that we were lost why because we were unbelievers we did not believe that God could save you and you really didn't care at the time please people please you say no I love God from birth well that's good but if you're not born again you're as dead as Adolf Hitler hello somebody that old life got to be not just divorced or not just hid under a bush or kicked in a closet no it's got to be annihilated and there's only one way for it to be annihilated and that's by the blood of Jesus Christ no man and blood could do it why because there was no life in that blood that could come back into me and you mmm so that what we've been talking about the two lifes and let's talk about the promise now let's go to John 14:16 let's just see for a minute since we backed up we're going to read this again everybody all right say ma'am and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of some time truth owed I read that wrong sorry even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive and I'm going to add a little bit in there it does not want does not want you still want to go do those things out there then you don't have God in you period period I like to get in your face period because why see if now that Seth is not looking with eyes it's not looking with eyes that's looking by what the eye of faith amen that's looking by the eyes of faith because look by the odds of faith you can see things different than by your natural eyes and then because it sees him not because watch neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you amen I will not leave you comfortless ah-ah-ah that one man will come to you yet a little while in the world what see if me no more but you'll see me you I've never seen Jesus yeah I see him every day I team every day I opened the Bible I see I look at my brothers the sisters with the born-again experience I see I look in the mirror I look in the mirror and if I'm born again I see Jesus Christ right and I don't make me nothing right because I also look in there and I see some of that other life sniffling they're called the devil because I came from my mama my daddy and I have these characteristics that I have to try to get rid of right okay yellow a wild I love this scripture because look at that promise this world will not see me they'll see me no more but you'll see me you'll see me because I live you shall live also at that day now listen I tell them tell them back there in the back listen at that day look how look how that you say well that was a John wrote that and and Jesus spoke that and he's talking about his day no wait a minute at that moment they didn't know any of that at that moment they didn't know any of that even the disciples didn't know that but at this day the day of this revelation you shall know not just maybe or have a mental conception or what the Baptist said or what the Methodist said or what the Pentecostal said or what the brand of mine said at that day you shouting at you one person you got talking to you today not another group he's talking to you and that day you shall know that I am in my father I am in my father hello man wait a minute and ye and me and I in you and we all right there now to us that's free the god that's one man goes Jesus what he said I my father - you have to be careful when I'm reaching him I'm always in one and that day Jesus said I my father one if you've seen me you've seen the father so now that I am in my father and ye and me and I knew how in the world can you ever be defeated you got an eternal eternal eternal when I watch he keeps going in John 14:26 he says but the comforter now you talked about I will not leave you comfortless I'll send another comforter now who is it but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name so watch the name of the Holy Ghost Jesus crying what's the name of the father Jesus Christ we don't believe in a Trinity I promise you that now we believe in offices because remember he was in a dispensation of the father and the Old Testament we read it in just a minute because we got to get to that I kind of got ahead of myself then we had a dispensation of him to being down here then we have a dispensation of him being what you're not going to see me any more but I'll be with you even in you what in the Holy Spirit in a spirit form I'll be with you even in you till the end of the world or the end of the age all right but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you a man what a promise now what we know one thing's for sure we covered it last Sunday no one just kind of covered again in the Old Testament though when you come to the genesis 3:15 you see that God made a promise but because of sin he couldn't fulfill that promise at that moment members they lost fellowship there was an enmity enmity means a division in but the enmity means something very harsh so God put enmity he couldn't come down in the cool today and talk to Adam he couldn't he couldn't come up to Abel and say Abel I'm going to give you of my life can do that he borrowed itself remember remember that cherubims was around the tree of life so they couldn't get back to him now who's the Tree of Life Jesus Christ eternal life the Tree of Life was eternal life and God put a hedge around it that they couldn't get to it so in your Old Testament because of what happened in the animal kingdom God used the animals for sacrifice and it was allowed this is elementary but we're going to get we're going to get to somewhere in a minute but he used the animals and the blood of bulls and goats and Hebrews 9 6 let's go to that one now when these things were thus ordained the priest went always into the first article accomplishing the service of God but into the second went to high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people the Holy Ghost this signifying now watch the Holy Ghost signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest you see that the Holy Ghost signifying that the way who's the way Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life and then remember I told you about last Sunday and I was going to bring up and I may bring you next Sunday where brother Branham said and it to me it just lines everything right up he said Jesus did not bring you in inheritance the inheritance always was either that or Jesus had to make something when he was down here no your inheritance was the that Genesis 1:26 man the brunette was talking about the promise that that was not even created it just became into a form where you could see it amen but what did he come to do he came to make what away back to your inheritance because remember the the fellowship we got to come back into fellowship with God the only way to come back into fellowship with God is to do what by the blood that High Priest if he walk behind that veil without that blood of that lamb he died under bulls and goats he died because he did what he did not do what God told him to do but once the high priest did everything got everything together got the word right got the right revelation he took that blood and he walked back in there and he give it for him and for the people but remember he had to do that every year over and over and over again the Holy Ghost is signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest because see we can go into the Holy of Holies now by the new birth we are in the Holy of Holies amen they couldn't you couldn't just walk back in there remember who was it somebody sons went back in there died right Aaron's sons I believe it was now they were in line to be high priests but they didn't do it right it's like our life we think well I lays a piece of my life to just say it right well you bury it you better get taken care of and as the Holy Ghost this thing finds a way into the holiest of Holies was not yet made Memphis while the first time and uncle was just standing which you were talking with the Old Testament which was a figure for the time all right remember that phrase at that day when Jesus came that day was over with when Jesus came on our gave his life the tabernacle or the old temple in the old testament was done away with now they didn't know that they kept so what they kept so enough they kept sewing the curtain by God they should have known well no I guess they should they should have known if that thing was ripped from the top to the bottom that it wasn't a man that did it because it's pretty easy to stand down here and rip but to rip it from 40 feet high believe it was certainly something feet high that curtain got ripped from top to bottom they ought to know God did that which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not him make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscious that's you and then explanation of that the blood of bulls and goats only covered your sin if you had sinned that blood would cover that sin but remember that sin was still right there and then the next year guess what had to happen you carried that sin all the way through the year the high priests had to go right back into the same tabernacle and make another offering sin was still there right right so let's see what happens after that which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them that until the time of reformation but cry but Christ's coming as and high priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands dare to say not of this building what was he talking about his body neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit comes remember the blood it was in those animals sister Val that wasn't an eternal bond that was an eternal spirit that was animal blood right it just covered but the blood of a man that had eternal life he didn't just cover it he sent it back and there's nothing under there anymore hey man what a mighty God how much more shall the blood of Christ ensues you said you sitting here today so I can't live this as your exact recruit you can't live it you try and see you'll fail every time but Paul got revelation he said it's not either liveth but Christ that liveth in me he he asked Christ to come into his life and live it for him amen how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit see blood of bulls and goats don't have eternal spirit Christ had an eternal spirit thank God that was that Genesis 1:26 men that eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God that's the question and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament remember the Old Testament there was a Testament bulls and goats something had to die and it didn't do away with your life because remember those people would just keep on sinning it had nothing to do with taking that old life out and putting a new life in God was just covering their life until he died at Calvary and then I'm telling you that's why that nobody had a new birth in their soul in the Old Testament there was not there was no life of an animal that could burn that old nature out of you no but there was a man came that's the promise that's the woman's seeds it had to be the woman's seed come that they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead listen unless you're just real goofy they don't read your will while you're still alive they read your will when you're dead because that Testament is not enforced that will is not enforced until the person is dead right amen I mean you know we got all these living wills and all this stuff but I'm talking about usually when you go in a lawyer's office and sit down the deceased is not in the room and when they read the will it's something that he or she has given you upon death Christ had to die and upon death he brought in a New Testament man which was not it was the Old Testament done away but a New Testament was in what hang on a minute he'll tell you what it is for a testament is the force after men are dead otherwise it is no strength at all while the testator liveth that's why the New Testament only began in the book of Acts Matthew Mark Luke and John is not the beginning of the New Testament the testator was still alive Bible says that while he's still alive it has no strength they were still under the law when Christ was here but when Christ died let's go to the next let's go the next scripture this is the communion Scripture he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins now what he's doing he's telling them that the next day he's going to die and his blood is going to what be spilled on the earth and the life that was in that blood is going to come back for a new Testament because the Old Testament couldn't do away with your old life it had no strength because the testator was still life but when he died when Christ died his blood was of the New Testament that now it doesn't just do away with your sin it covers your sins not just coverage your sin it does away with it and then it does away with your sin your be happy 3 you say I used to do this and I used to do that and I used to do this not used to do that yeah you still remember you know what God doesn't God doesn't remember it and that Old Testament sin people even the high priest you know they had to write things down there was always a remembrance the Bible said there was a remembrance every year they were something written down nothing going nothing going what sins are you talking about in their song it's the Mayo write a good song about that what sins are you talking about all right look now let's go to Hebrews 11 and let's put a little punctuation mark on this Hebrews 11 37 they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted now this is Hebrews 11 is to faith chapter of the Bible by faith able by faith Abraham by faith Jacob by faith Moses by faith Enoch by faith help me somebody of Sarah by faith and he just runs through the whole list and that's all in the Old Testament right by faith they did this they were stoned they were sawn asunder Isaiah was cut in pieces he was a young man Isaiah that wrote I was in the Bible he was a young man he was a priest and they killed him and they actually hacked him into they cut him they saw him asunder Paul knew this right in the book of Hebrew we're tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented and you know what if we wrote a commentary about it they were defeated right they would look like they were a defeated bunch of people paul says of whom the world was not even worthy the world was not even worthy to them for them to even walk on the earth they wandered in deserts in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise none of them had a new birth in their soul they had their old life and by faith though a good report through faith they believed God I ever have believed God and it was what imputed to him for righteousness now Abraham wanted a very righteous guy give his wife away twice laughed at God said oh my Ishmael walk before you but when you look back to the blood Paul said strong in faith never stagger that's a prophecy God and we think these little frivolous things that we we think is hindering us please if you put them under the blood got on even see him I telling you those days by life telling him I telling the other day I was praying I said God I just really I'm sorry I did I actually I must have went by a place or something brought to my memory something that I did that was wrong and I said God I'm sorry forgive me of that little boy spoke said please oh my what are you talking about what sins are you talking about and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better Jesus Christ for us is that all right you say that's this thing you know that the Bible calls the Holy Ghost of thing yeah so you know be careful but that's okay for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen that all right now watch here's another scripture that then I came upon first John 2:25 watch this I I really hadn't read this before but I love the little John's I just got finished reading them how many times have you read through the Bible and you reads book of John and you go I didn't read that first John 2:25 and this is to promise that he has promised us even eternal life boy you can put just put a punctuation mark on that that is the promise eternal life with the Creator amen let's read this conferences number one I can imagine God our Father down the Garden of Eden looking around to find a certain tree to where he could call his children up in his presence under this tree he selected the place and he called that conference and he stood at him and even the Serpent and there was a conference hell they had trespassed his laws and his laws were just and must the penalty must be paid and how are they going to live after the death sentence hangs on them because remember he said the day you eat thereof that day you're done right the first covenant that God said he said the day you eat thereof he said that day you'll die all right and how are they going to live after the death sentence hangs on them and there was a conference held and there was a perpetuation made for that sin brother Dale covered to this morning lamb slain before the foundation of the world okay and temporarily look temporarily until the woman seed was to bruise the Serpent's head that would pay the full penalty of sin there was a lamb sacrificed until that time to be fulfilled and there was something that was achieved there was something done that was great a way that man could be saved again hey man before the foundation of the world because watch Hebrews 10 let's continue reading now for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing can never with those sacrifices would they offer year by year continually make the comers air into perfect by any Old Testament received the promise age they weren't perfect now look God looking through the eyes of truth I'm sorry through the blood they were they were covered for the moment all right but for then would they not have ceased to be offered he's asking a question question mark because that the worshiper once purged should have no more conscience of sin that's what God's wanting but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year remember I said I wrote him down for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sin so it couldn't take away sin it only covered sin amen now let's go down to 9 just ask it for time and then said i lo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second what he done was he took those cherubims that were around the tree of life and he broke them back he opened the seal he took the seal off of that tree amen and he says I am the way the truth and the life I'm not just away on the tree how can you lose when you walk into a end of the court as brother Branham would always say you walk into the court and you've been convicted of something so there says Jesus is the prosecutor there says Jesus is the defense attorney there says Jesus is a judge and they all go what we doing here what seems like you humped what this man do but he took away the first at him in established the second he takes away your first life so that he can establish your second life and then he takes away all that old and all things become new by which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all it does not have listen we put him on the cross all time we put him back on the cross all the time can you die I've already died can you I've already died can you I've already listen people we have got to realize that this thing was over before it started but we've got to prove it down here like we were talking in the back sure God was Jesus Christ was slain before the foundation world in the mind of God but it had to happen in reality here for what a testament what is a testament it's a testifying man by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the blood of Jesus Christ once for all and every priest and if daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sin but this man this woman seed that said I'll put enmity back in genesis 3:15 he knew he would have to be the one to put it back together but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from went forth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he has perfected forever hold on a minute you don't see that I made it bigger so y'all the older ones can see you look Anderson's going let's read this together for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified what's your problem what's your problem I mean really what's your problem we still got a little unbelief is what it is we're of the Holy Ghost also is a witness because look when he takes you from that first life and puts that second life in you that is the witness that he's there Amen that's the witness that he now not only looks over you he resides in you where after that he said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days says the Lord I will put my laws in their heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I always remember oh wait a minute roll it up put it up about right here up this way up and down we got to get that right somewhere and and for those of y'all that are sitting up front you read this but read it with me and their sins and iniquities will I remember no or no what more let's read acts 1 we don't continue here with the promise just for a few minutes less all right and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem now this is Jesus right before he goes up but wait for the promise of the father which says he have heard of me because remember he just told them for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence what a promise Romans 4 verse 12 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that face of our father Abraham which he has been yet uncircumcised now for those of you that don't know that in the Old Testament they would circumcise the Jews with circumcised as a sign they would cut the foreskin off of the male member and that would show that you were under the Covenant of Abraham which was a type of the Holy Ghost doing away with the first life and all the old skin so that was a promise but it really never made anybody perfect because when Paul comes over here he says uncircumcision circumcision what are y'all talking about it's not of the flesh anymore it's of the inside man circumcise the flesh of the inside guy all right but who also walk in the steps of that face of our father Abraham which he had being yet circumcised because remember Abraham started well listen Abram walked through the promise uncircumcised remember he was 90 and nine when he was circumcised well anyway but remember it was a sign and he did his whole household and then what happened was that made a whole generation that they showed who they were why they were separating people you were a haven if you weren't circumcised but see that was only a what a law or that was only a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that didn't save Abraham and that didn't save any of them but by faith Abraham did it for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or exceed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void in other words do's and don'ts do this don't do that do this don't do that faith is made void and the promise made of no effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all so it's by faith are we saved and you say well rather you just sit talked about do's and don'ts listen you get rid of the the first life and you get rid of those do's and dont's what's that somebody able to make a song the things I used to do I do them no more we ought to make a song about that Aaron I think some of our hair is happening things I used to do I do them no more why Paul said the life that I now live I live by what the faith that God climbed on the cross for me and for you and died in the flesh that he might take his life and bring it right back into me and not only just push that old life of mine out but I nyle ate that life amen you better believe that if not then all you've done was you just swept him over in the closet and shut the door and when you need something else you open the door to let it out according to the Bible your old life must be dead I didn't say wife your old life must be dead let me tell you something else your old husband better be dead because you were married to Satan by your first life and if that man is not dead you're committing adultery and man that goes with natural and spiritual but spiritually we got to get this thing right listen Galatians 4 verse 22 I love this no wait a minute what we do go to Galatians 3 21 we're reading scripture today is that Alright and I was one that said the other day that we don't have to have a quote for everything we don't have to have one if you're not now to the to the place and I know there's young ones here but if you're not now to the place that you don't know the essence of this message then you're just behind I'm sorry you're just behind if you can't catch up it's not my fault cuz we're throwing it out there as fast as we can pull it out hey man you can't plead ignorance in this church is the law then against the promises of God god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness would have been by the law that's exactly right that's why I put that in there but the scripture but the scripture hath concluded look the scripture what we're reading has concluded all under sin remember the whole Hebrews 11 they none of them received the promise they still came under the sin curse of the Old Testament now the Old Testament wasn't sin curse but the sin curse was in the Old Testament okay it wasn't annihilate it until Christ came okay but the scripture hath concluded all under sin so what choice do we have I mean what's the woman's like some people they will will and have a choice yeah you got a choice that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that belief but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed right let me tell you something the Bible says in Revelations 21 that when that books open and you stand before judgment you're going to be judged by your works and your works is filthy rags in God's eyes but why not let's move over into this bride group let's move over into this new life to where we don't have to stand in judgment we stand as the judge judging not by my works you know what I'm going to point to Christ if I'm born again that's my that's my head because that's my shield that's my that's my burner that keeps me clean as that Holy Ghost that came into my soul that kept me clean there is therefore now no what condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen now look let's go to the latians 4:22 because we're going to have to transfer from that one life to a new life I'd rather do things more a new creation in Christ and then for it is written that Abraham had two sons one by a bond woman and the other by a freewoman but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh now who was that Ishmael Sara said go tape mouth and made and and less produced the promise for God that was Sarah's idea but remember God told Abraham to do it like to fulfill the promise that he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh look I just got finished reading it there in Genesis where Abraham gave a lot to Ishmael he didn't deny him as a son by the flesh Abraham never denied him as the son by the flash right he couldn't cuz he was standing there he knew he had had that but he had a revelation later that what he had by the wrong woman he had the wrong kid by the wrong woman the promise was to have it to Sarah and it was Isaac but he of the freewoman was by promise promise of the Holy Ghost to come into your life listen you were born under the bondwoman all of us that's why Christ had to come the way he did he didn't come under upon woman he didn't come by sex income under bondage like you and I we were all born in bondage except for one but he was the problem son to come by the freewoman by the woman she'd coming down to earth to live in a flesh body just like me in you but he was able to fulfill the promise that he should know that was God back in Genesis 3 well we believe in one God we just believe in one God it's not for voices or three voices or two voices it's one voice Jesus said before Abraham was I am he was that I am the spoke to Moses in the burning bush so he was the one that spoke in genesis 3:15 and said I'm coming four thousand years from now I'm coming you're not going to stop me Satan you're not going to stop me nobody's going to stop me I am coming to a virgin and I am going to clean that womb up I'm going to clean you up and I'm going to take you back to where are you supposed to be that to me is the promise the promise is that we got lost but we connect ourselves to the eternal he's going to take us right back to the Garden of Eden where we were supposed to be has there not been a fall amen Ephesians 1 verse 13 and whom he also trusted see this is your first life this says and whom ye also trusted after after that you started this new life I want to ask y'all some one question ask you a question be honest with me did you think about God when you were a sinner we got one honest one among us I mean did you did you ever I mean sure that was times in my life when God would I come to church or mom or dad would some what happen their life and somebody something happened but when you live in your common life before you were born again do you ever think about God no I didn't say think about God I didn't think I needed to read my Bible I read other things I have come to church why Colette have a desire to come that was that life that was under the bondwoman but thank God the promise was still there the promise was eternal the promise was there and could not be what it could not be annihilated because remember the first promise has to be an ally or the first life has to be annihilated but now when I come into the Commonwealth of God and became an offspring of God it turned all my attention to this things of God thinking about God all the time things that happen in my life now and your life I connect them with God it's a god thing you know you connect it with that I don't connect it with the world when I do something wrong I knew I step down and did something wrong trust a God forgive me don't you worry about that because remember you're still fighting I told him down downstairs brother Brahm didn't preach the greatest battle ever fought was in your soul because remember it's not a battle if Satan's in there just what I just said did you think about God did you think about godly things when when you were doing the things of the devil no you were the devil and you did the things of the devil and the devil was the one that had control of that inside guy but once you had him once you drove him out Luke the unclean spirit goes out of a man walking Dry places seeking rest find us none cometh back finding it swept and garnished and if you don't put something that new life in he's going to come back in there and he's going to make you set in a message Church and think you save and I write if you ever get to oligo you'll know I mean David somebody yesterday with some person that we were talking about we you'll know when that person gets to baptism and Holy Ghost a some people it's you just going to know it cause see they did it with me they knew my life had changed when God came into my life and gave me the baptism of the Holy go people knew that something had changed and then I didn't just suppress it see a lot of times will come to the altar and we'll what we'll do is like a guy steady sees you just like the being in prison you're not sorry that you're that you did what you did you're sorry you got caught right robbery you've seen that meantime they got sorry they got caught they always say they find Jesus in jail no you're right buddy no what happened was they got caught and their conscience said you got caught but if you ever take and take that what's inside of that and let God burn it out that desire won't come anymore to do the things that you used to do a man because look and whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory the Holy Ghost is the earnest let's go to Ephesians 2 verse 12 then at that time look then at that time you were without Christ this is your first life being what aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise that's what I just told you about we were strangers walking around in the world doing the world doing the things of the world but remember if you're a child of God and you're coming to God you become a stranger amen you become a little different and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh what that gap is being pulled together that enmity that came in and the Old Testament there was no way for God to get back to man but when God became man he put it all back together amen but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the white blood of Christ for he is our peace who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us the lords that division remember Hey look before you became before you became a Christian you didn't want to be around Christian just for a few minutes maybe come on people everybody say man hey man that Saint the old grandma all yours if she started talking about God just like grandma I think I'll go outside and count to ass in the yard or something I'm you know I'm not right we will not to do it while we were alienated we didn't want any of that that wasn't for us how many of you said that I cannot for me but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh why now you want to be around Christian why do you won't be around Christian because you like minded you draw strength that's why we come that's why I come to church I sorry I don't come to see y'all I come to get a refilling I come to get refueled I'm glad you're here and you're my friends but I don't come to them you know bro Kali ain't there today you ain't going no if brother Kali ain't here I'm coming I'm not gonna ask whether he's here or not I used you because I know what could but now in Christ Jesus he being sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ where he is our peace who has made for one both one both war and that's broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished now look I like that word abolish that means done away with having abolished in his flesh the enmity now that word enmity was way over in Genesis right amen having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances he talked about the Old Testament he talking about the Torah he's talking about all that in the Old Testament you know somebody said the other day we were talking about and no offence stand by here I was going to say this anyway you know the Bible says a woman shouldn't wear clothes pertaining to a man and somebody said well that's the Old Testament I said you believe in the Ten Commandments she said yeah I said that's in the Old Testament thing having a pretty brother having abolished in his flesh then I thought you'd sleep like that for me hey you get over set closer to board he'll start doing that even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances listen let me be honest with you like I wasn't going to be this is not do's and don'ts I did the things I do because of what my wife bottom line but when the life of Christ came in me the things I used to do I do them no more why because I have turned what is repent turn now look one preacher was preaching one time he says when I repented he said I turn he said I did a 360 a 360 is this same way you were going you got to do a 180 I think you talking about Michael Jordan doing a 360 you know I think you got to do it 160 180 thank you your weight 180 and go this way good job I told them I was gonna keep him waiting huh but now look this is what I want to get to full clothes right here I'm not going to ever get them a - light - I'm gonna get well I got a demand I mean Cain and Abel out of the wound of the day so might as well get this done having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances because remember look real quick he abolished in his place remember it wasn't that God was not wholly during the Old Testament but he was a spirit God is a spirit now remember it's theophany he was showed itself in many forms he did come down in human flesh but he didn't come down as the woman seed he wasn't the woman's seed as Melchizedek he wasn't the woman's seed as the captain of the host right a man so he had to come in when he said I when he talked about the woman see that meant he was coming in human flesh and man even the law of commandments contained in order to score to make in himself of plain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby he took he took genesis 3:15 and just didn't do away with it no he didn't remember Christ didn't do away with the law he magnified it he made genesis 3:15 like brother Shetty was saying Wednesday night I love that he made genesis 3:15 step right out of the scripture and I tell you that thing that dad's got back there if you've seen it we'll look at next Sunday I'll put up on the screen but it's the Bible being flipped open and there's pages and they come up and they form a man the Word made flesh and then you see Jesus will put your put you in there put you in there whatever speaks of Christ speaks to you in the beginning was the word and if you're part of the word now you were there you weren't there in a human body you weren't there in anything except God's eternal mind the eternal section I was like I told you last Sunday there's books books of life brother Brown said there's one part that of sinners is eating him right in the book I got quote him write him in a book in other words he didn't even have to keep up with their life not that he didn't want to he wanted to he wanted all saved but he knew that see that's what helps me with God with foreknowledge he could give it a new he could give Adolf Hitler ten million years and he'd never accept Jesus Christ he could give anybody you say give him a billion years they'd never accept he knew that therefore he collect them live their life on earth and go and die and be sent to torment because he knew if he give them millions of years they never would come to God because what foreknowledge he knew they never come to that what the Bible says coming to the knowledge of the truth you and I one day we came to the knowledge that this Bible and this Christ that died at Calvary was the truth it wasn't a fairy tale it was something that actually happened and it didn't happen for you it happened for me it didn't happen for you it happened for me it's for me only you're not included you better say the same thing because I can't go in on you and you can't go in on me but we can all go in on him a man you love Lord I'll tell you what let's just stop right there for to turn anybody going please I didn't say was going to close and go home yet but having abolished in his flesh the enmity so we've got the enmity abolished we've got the two lives though that we have to deal with for Jamaican himself of twain one new man what in other words he comes in and does it now listen he doesn't kill you as far as you you being dead and yet so leaves you he kills the nature that you were born under that's the old life and then you become a what a new creation listen if you don't if you don't think different if you don't act different listen we all have problems we all have ups and downs I told him downstairs I said look I promise you eternal life he didn't promise you a perfect life because he said you gonna have problems because you know why we have problems cuz we're alienated we're we're aliens to this world we don't even think like this world people y'all work with people and you listen to them you go my heaven where they get that from alright your own sister sometimes you know you yeah oh hey Jean I don't see sentiments all right but listen you listen to them talk no please you listen to them talking you go where did that come from how can you think that you know what it's the devil that's what he thinks God didn't put that thought in your mind if it's contrary to the word you just had a thought of your own and you're not listening you're not going to help those thoughts coming but you're being given a promise that if you're what have faith and what he's already saying turn your eyes toward him don't worry about the things of the world you just got to know that you know that you know that your first life is over over not two or three months later let it come back up over over and honestly you need to have put that on your on your refrigerator we put everything in world on a refrigerator but the things I used to do I do them no more now if you're lying you're not walking in okay the things I used to do I do them no more I come to church expecting God to talk to me I come to church not expecting to learn something that somebody else don't know that's the devil that's intelligence but I come for God to put pieces together questions yesterday we were talking about things about angels I had a question well one of the questions for answered just by a simple conversation why because it was what it was to people that has a new book that we're able to talk to each other because really it's not I live anymore its Christ that liveth in me and the life I now live there's a scripture in the Bible for them yeah I think I read it forehead first was the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God who lit who give his life and died he said this is just an old salvation story if we ever get away from an old salvation story and think that it's boring why do you think the sons of God shouted for joy because they saw the plan of redemption I just told you the plan of redemption was Jesus Christ coming to earth and human flesh dying resurrected couldn't come back into the believers at that time because he was in flesh but when he went back up and ascended to the Father he what he didn't send another person he just stepped over in that spirit form again and come right down into the believer hey man and that's the reason we can understand the Word of God that's the reason we can understand preachers preaching the Word of God is because we got the one that wrote it inside of us let me tell you something if you can't understand the Word of God you don't have the whole ego sorry I didn't say all of it but if you know if you're not if you don't have a clue you need to you need the one that gives you the clue because remember he said he would what leads you and guide you into all truth he will not leave you comfortless he will not leave you out in the dark but you know what a problem is God turns the lights on we turn them on got turned the lights on we turn them off is all right we turn them off leave the light on just don't be like the people say the lights on but nobody's home I like this right here new man new woman I've seen in the let's stand our feet we just has come I've seen in our life my life being back here I've seen a lot of us change and you know one thing's for sure it's God that did it because you and I can't do it our problem is is we've seen people come and go and some that we thought would stay wooden and some that we thought wouldn't did that's why you can't figure it out you just let God handle it and then you just sit back and watch God do his plan he'll work her right out every time problem is is we stick we go jump right in the middle of the plan no stay away stay away just open up your heart and let God come in that's just as simple and then you know what after that after you come into this great Commonwealth of God then you get every promise every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse and some of the lines no it is every chapter I don't saying that you think what you want sing sing the other Lord this is the evening time on page 523 if you have a need real quick Lord bless your heart for listening so we can walk around with your lives that one life go and be a new man a new creation the bride is preparing for [Music] thank you our sister standing here for a husband Lord and we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you'll take that away from him Lord as we speak and then he'll come back with a true confession Lord that you truly are the one that has done the healing from bless my brother Lord bless our system he wasn't going to make care what Jesus meant displayed varieties preparing [Music] right goodbye we break that in here Lord with the connection of maybe between me and another Lord in the name of Jesus Christ at our brothers eyes will be restored back color we believe that Lord you're the one to get it you're the one invaded you made these eyes Lord now we prayed this runaway Fred and then I'm rather be holding the name of Jesus things already the favor that I've been here to hear evening time later many things preparing now for all things already [Music] we all hate to have and that's with our children the Lord Jesus with great in your precious name Lord you're the creator that you would take her Lord and now as we turn her over to You Lord but you would drive her back to you Lord there's a man is drinking away from her lawyer and all that depression and the anger the things that she has were afraid to take those things away and give our brother silver here people that they were depend on his father for whatever happens we look to you in the name of Jesus Christ already [Music] you believe that listen all the players are on the field people back in the ages they had to wait on a prophet to come [Music] number four of Elijah had to wait so that's what the Bible said I had to wait for brother Ram to come on the scene preach this message and then then revelations 10-7 had to be brought in two days of the voice of the seven thing then you've got 144,000 Jews that's sitting over in Israel already back together somewhere in there they're waiting that can't be babies they can't be dead they got to be alive you got two witnesses it's got to come the fifth coming of Elijah and Moses got to go the Jews what's holding this thing up we are I told them this morning the right of redemption was that Boaz the type of Christ but Boaz redeemed Naomi right and he got Ruth right but what happened was that wasn't the whole story Boaz and Ruth had to have a child and had to take that child and turn him back over to Naomi amen the right of redemption is not over until the Gentiles produce Jesus Christ and send him to the Jew we're holding this thing up it's our problem I've considered it my problem that we're not out of here we not a resurrection and the only reason resurrection is not happening somebody don't have enough faith at the moment to speak it and it come to pass we got to build that faith and not then listen it can't be an artificial faith either because you know what's going to happen use on an artificially build it up and Satan's the first one is gonna come by and he's gonna kick her down right but you let God do it let God raise that up let God do the speaking have a passion for this message have a passion for God and you know what he's the greatest lover that ever will he knows every move you need he knows every everyday what you need before you need it hey man he knows what you're going through he knows what you need and he's already put it there in the Word of God a way to get over it but the greatest thing is that God has got everything right where it's supposed to be lifted we don't have another church egg we don't have another prophet to come we don't have another message to come so what's left produce what's already been spoke we must produce it we must start speaking and expect God to do something not just hope he does well I think I'll just I'll just whisper it and if they don't happen it won't make me look bad how we gonna get the dead out of the ground without you got to have a bold face Jesus walked up to the tomb and brother Brown said Jesus did not have to pray to raise Lazarus he was already prayed up before the foundation of the world where where were you you were in that man before the foundation of the world but we're already prayed up we just got to realize then there's the evening time folks this is not the morning this is not the afternoon this is the evening time and the next thing for us is getting out of here going home it's
