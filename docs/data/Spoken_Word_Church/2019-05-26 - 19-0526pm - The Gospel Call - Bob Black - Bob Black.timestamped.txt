[26:47] all my heart with all that hymn that
[26:49] with all I am and that's how we should
[26:51] be doing it right not halfway I think so
[26:54] many today that we pledge you know we
[26:56] kind of give give things a little bit
[26:58] halfway kind of withhold a little bit
[27:00] but we should be given everything that
[27:02] we have to this gospel so this more this
[27:06] afternoon I want to talk about a little
[27:07] topic called just the gospel call which
[27:10] is on my something been on my heart this
[27:11] week and and we'll start off by reading
[27:15] Joshua chapter 23 and then we'll go to
[27:21] Joshua chapter 24 just the first eight
[27:24] verses from Joshua chapter 23 and then
[27:27] Joshua chapter 24 but before we do that
[27:29] let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord
[27:32] God I'm so grateful Lord to be able to
[27:34] come together and look into your word
[27:36] once again look into the mirror of your
[27:38] word and find out what our we're living
[27:40] in and where we stand Lord Jesus and
[27:42] Lord God Lord it's such a privilege to
[27:46] be able to find out whether there be any
[27:48] fault in us or not or whether we're
[27:50] holding upright with the word Lord Jesus
[27:52] Lord God I pray Lord that you'll help us
[27:55] Lord Jesus and you're just quick in the
[27:57] word to us Lord God to be able to
[27:58] realize where we stand this evening Lord
[28:01] Jesus and I pray oh god it's your spirit
[28:03] Lord we'll move up over this
[28:05] congregation Lord Jesus as we invite you
[28:07] Lord to come in and dwell with us and
[28:09] worship with us Lord Jesus and make this
[28:11] not just a gathering together Lord but a
[28:13] real worship service Lord Jesus because
[28:16] that's what I believe that the bride and
[28:17] this day has Lord Jesus she's got a real
[28:19] move of the Holy Spirit move
[28:21] in our Lord Jesus moving in the Church
[28:23] of the Living God to make us something
[28:25] that maybe the world the world doesn't
[28:27] know anything about Lord Lord we ask
[28:29] Lord Jesus that you'll just take the
[28:31] preeminence of this service Lord God and
[28:33] open up the word though our hearts speak
[28:34] to us Lord Jesus in a way maybe that
[28:37] just idiot man couldn't Lord God but we
[28:39] know Lord Jesus said the father draws
[28:41] Lord Jesus and I know Lord God that
[28:43] you'll draw during this service Lord
[28:45] Jesus that's what I'm expecting Lord I
[28:47] come expecting that this won't be just
[28:49] any old any regular church service Lord
[28:52] but they didn't you'll make it something
[28:54] special we ask it and believe in the
[28:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[29:01] Joshua chapter 23 verses 1 to 8 Joshua
[29:06] said and it came to Kent came to pass a
[29:08] long time after that the Lord had given
[29:10] a rest unto Israel from all their
[29:11] enemies round about that joshua waxed
[29:13] old and stricken in age and joshua
[29:16] called for all israel and for their
[29:18] elders and for their heads and for the
[29:20] judges and for their officers and said
[29:21] unto them i am old and stricken in age
[29:23] in other words he's calling all the
[29:26] young folks to gather around to hear a
[29:27] little bit of wisdom from an old person
[29:29] that had been through some men through
[29:30] some trials if you remember when he went
[29:33] when they got called out of out of egypt
[29:35] Joshua and Caleb were the only ones to
[29:37] live to see this this this part of the
[29:39] journey so Joshua's he's old and he's
[29:42] been through some stuff and he wants to
[29:43] impart a little bit of wisdom to the
[29:45] young folks and you have seen all that
[29:48] the Lord your God has done into all
[29:50] these nations because of you for the
[29:51] Lord your God is he that has fought for
[29:54] you see there's another thing people
[29:57] think that we're just fighting where it
[29:59] is fighting out these battles ourselves
[30:01] maybe the young people the old ones
[30:03] everybody thinks that you got a struggle
[30:05] in your life that you're gonna be the
[30:06] one to deliver yourself but Joshua said
[30:08] no it wasn't it wasn't us it wasn't by
[30:11] our by our own doings it was by the Lord
[30:14] that fought for us and he said behold I
[30:17] have divided unto you by a lot these
[30:19] nations that remain to be an inheritance
[30:21] for your tribes from Jordan with all the
[30:24] nations that I have cut off even unto
[30:26] the Great Sea westward in other words he
[30:28] had placed him into their inheritance
[30:30] exactly according to the way that God
[30:32] had thought of it before and in his mind
[30:34] in his prime
[30:35] they haven't been put into the promised
[30:37] land exactly the way that God had Ford
[30:38] ordained even to the way that when they
[30:40] were born their mama cried out a word of
[30:42] prophecy exhorting how that they would
[30:45] be placed exactly where they would go
[30:47] and he's telling them something he's
[30:49] like Luke you look you're now in the
[30:50] promised land and the Lord your God he
[30:53] shall expel them from before you and
[30:55] drive them out of your sight and ye
[30:56] shall possess their land as the Lord
[30:58] your God hath promised unto you be
[31:01] therefore very courageous to keep and to
[31:03] do all that is written in the book of
[31:05] the law of Moses that you turned out a
[31:06] side there from there from to the right
[31:09] hand or to the left be very courageous
[31:13] to keep every commandment everything
[31:16] that the Lord God has told you to do
[31:17] don't turn to the right hander to the
[31:19] left that you come not among these
[31:22] nations these that remain among you
[31:24] neither make a mention they make mention
[31:25] of the name of their gods no calls to
[31:27] swear by them neither serve them know
[31:30] about yourselves unto them but cleave
[31:32] unto the Lord your God as you have done
[31:35] unto this day
[31:36] now cleave don't mean just to just to
[31:38] you know go to church and just kind of
[31:40] get around it a little bit but cleave me
[31:42] it's like to be vulcanized to it clean
[31:44] means to like that remember that one of
[31:46] David's mighty man that grabbed up the
[31:48] sword and he went to fight and until the
[31:50] sword his hand clove to the sword he
[31:53] couldn't let go of the sword because he
[31:55] had fought so valiantly and that's what
[31:57] that's what I believe that he met with
[31:58] cleave he means grab ahold of God with
[32:01] all the sinew and don't let go now let's
[32:04] go over to Joshua chapter 24 verse 14 to
[32:08] 15 he says he continues on after you've
[32:12] been exhorting I mean he says now
[32:13] therefore fear the Lord and serve Him in
[32:15] sincerity and in truth and put away the
[32:18] gods which your father's served on the
[32:20] other side of the flood and in Egypt and
[32:22] serve you the Lord and if it seem evil
[32:24] unto you to serve the Lord choose you
[32:26] this day whom he will serve whether the
[32:28] gods which your father's served that
[32:30] whether on the other side of the flood
[32:31] or the gods that they amber ice and
[32:33] whose land you to hell but that's from
[32:35] me and my house we will serve the Lord
[32:38] you may be seated the Lord at his
[32:40] blessing to the working in the word when
[32:43] I when I started preaching I one of the
[32:45] these older ministers that pastored
[32:47] another church he told me you know
[32:48] that's where that's where Minister
[32:50] starts is as for me and my house we will
[32:52] serve the Lord when you when you make a
[32:55] make a make a choice when you make a
[32:57] choosing that your house is going to be
[32:59] the ones that that is set apart that is
[33:01] that you have made it a choice in your
[33:04] mind that your house is going to be one
[33:06] that serves the Lord that all the people
[33:08] that live in your house are going to
[33:09] abide by a set of rules that come
[33:11] straight from the Word of God then
[33:12] that's where that's where a Christian
[33:14] life really starts hey you know I maybe
[33:17] I just want to preach on start preaching
[33:19] from this verse you choose you this day
[33:22] whom you will serve because you know
[33:24] every believers got to come to a place
[33:25] every person brother Branham taught us
[33:28] comes to a place where you have a choice
[33:30] sit before you can choose either right
[33:31] or you can choose role you can choose
[33:34] like the amorite religion it's a Moabite
[33:36] religion you can choose like the
[33:38] bedlamite religion that had been
[33:39] presented in front of them or you can
[33:41] choose the way of the Lord you have a
[33:43] right that you have a you you have a
[33:45] these two choices set in front of you
[33:47] and you have to make a choice and nobody
[33:50] can put that force you to make that
[33:51] choice it's all up to you your mama and
[33:54] your daddy can't make you can't force
[33:56] you to make the choice your pastor can't
[33:57] force you to make the choice it's a
[33:59] choice that you are though you are the
[34:01] only one that can make and you know I
[34:03] believe that everybody everybody that
[34:04] comes to church they want to make a
[34:06] choice they might want to make let's put
[34:07] it like this they want to make a stand
[34:09] they want to stand for one thing under
[34:11] another they want to they want to stand
[34:12] for what's true what's right and I
[34:15] believe that Joshua was well-acquainted
[34:17] with taking a stand and that's why he
[34:18] began to exhort all the all the young
[34:20] people that were gathered around him
[34:22] about making a stand because you see he
[34:24] had lived through some things where he
[34:26] had seen people make a stand and he had
[34:28] seen people not make a stand and so he
[34:31] had come through a place where he knew
[34:32] he knew the consequences of not making a
[34:35] stand if you remember when Moses went
[34:37] down into into Egypt he'd make he made
[34:39] us stand by himself and he made a stand
[34:42] not just upon some intellectual
[34:43] intellectual conception of God calling
[34:45] him but he made us stand because he
[34:47] hadn't met God and a burning bush and he
[34:50] knew who it was that came and talked to
[34:51] him and he went down
[34:53] failure and he said like like our pastor
[34:55] is always told of some failure I said
[34:56] who's coming to deliver Israel who's
[34:59] coming to deliver these Israelites and
[35:00] and and and Moses answered back I am
[35:03] because he had a personal revelation
[35:05] that God had given to him and he took a
[35:07] stand and I believe Joshua remembered as
[35:09] he was speaking to all these young
[35:11] people he remembered all these times
[35:12] that somebody had taken a stand as
[35:15] Joshua went out of the children went out
[35:17] with all of the children of Israel has
[35:18] he journeyed with Moses he remembered
[35:21] how all the people began to complain
[35:23] about bread they began to complain about
[35:24] bread coming down from God out of heaven
[35:26] you know what Jesus was on earth he said
[35:28] I am that bread that comes down from God
[35:30] out of heaven and the people began to
[35:32] complain about it because he didn't come
[35:33] in the way that they wanted it to and
[35:35] you see people even today in the message
[35:37] around on Facebook and wherever
[35:38] complaining about the revelation of this
[35:40] hour they don't want revelation anymore
[35:42] they don't work the Word of God in this
[35:44] hour they'd rather have somebody telling
[35:46] them all about how to live and how to be
[35:48] a good little person and how to be a
[35:49] good moral person but I believe that
[35:51] what you need in this hour is the
[35:52] revelation of the hour the revelation of
[35:54] God that he has given us you know you
[35:57] can get you can get in your head where
[35:59] you start complaining about coming to
[36:00] church you can start complaining about
[36:01] well I don't want to it seems so bored
[36:04] and everything it seems it seems like
[36:05] it's just the same thing rehash it over
[36:07] and over I've heard that sermon preached
[36:08] before but you know that's the same
[36:10] thing that the children of Israel did
[36:12] they began to complain about that bread
[36:13] that God has sent them down from heaven
[36:16] to feed them on the journey and that was
[36:18] exactly what they had need of I believe
[36:22] it's time to take a stand in this hour
[36:24] take a stand for revelation take a stand
[36:26] for the word of God that God has given
[36:28] it to us because this is the only thing
[36:30] that's going to take this out of here
[36:31] that's the only thing to combat the
[36:33] devil in this hour it's the only thing
[36:34] that can give you delivering power in
[36:36] your life delivering power over the
[36:38] things of this world it's the only thing
[36:40] that can give you overcoming power and
[36:43] that's what I take a stand for you know
[36:45] Joshua when he came to Kadesh Barnea and
[36:47] he saw he saw all the other Israelites
[36:50] began to not take a stand they failed to
[36:53] take a stand there when when God was
[36:55] able to deliver them from the Giants and
[36:57] and they came to that place y'all scuse
[37:01] me they came to that place there at
[37:04] credence barn the other great
[37:06] the great juncture time the great
[37:07] standoff where only two brother I'm
[37:10] talking about one in a million he began
[37:12] to explain how very very few would go
[37:14] all the way to a real true birth very
[37:17] very feud and compared it to Enoch and
[37:19] Noah and he compared it to Joshua Caleb
[37:22] they're two out of out of millions that
[37:25] came out of Egypt just two two were the
[37:27] only ones that stood there that took a
[37:29] stand there were only two that we're
[37:31] willing to take a stand in that hour you
[37:34] look around and you begin to wonder
[37:36] maybe could it be like that in this day
[37:38] maybe could it be like that were so many
[37:40] people come to church but so many so few
[37:42] people are willing to take a stand for
[37:44] the gospel willing to take a stand and
[37:46] say I believe that God is able to
[37:48] deliver everything every promise of God
[37:50] he's able to able to manifest every
[37:52] single Word of God that he's put made
[37:56] ready for this day now you see you see
[38:00] how dangerous it is do not take a stand
[38:02] do not stick us to take a stand for
[38:04] truth because every one of them died in
[38:07] the wilderness that we're unwilling to
[38:08] take a stand and so when Joshua will
[38:10] begin to talk to all these all these
[38:12] young people those were the offspring of
[38:14] the ones that had died in the wilderness
[38:15] because they were not willing to take a
[38:17] stand at Kadesh Barnea and then just as
[38:20] they were about to cross over so many
[38:22] didn't take a stand against the doctrine
[38:24] of Balaam which was we're all the same
[38:27] we're all the same there's no difference
[38:29] and you could see that even in the
[38:31] message play out today everybody people
[38:33] begin to be deceived and think that
[38:35] everybody's preaching the same thing
[38:37] when everybody is not preaching the same
[38:39] thing we are not all the same God God is
[38:43] God as a separator he is a
[38:44] segregationist because he takes he takes
[38:47] the righteous and moves them just like
[38:48] he took the children of Israel and move
[38:50] them down into Goshen he separated them
[38:52] through the from the evil he separated
[38:54] himself from the things of the world he
[38:56] separated him away and died the doctrine
[38:59] of balaam was that we're all the same
[39:01] let's just blend it all together you can
[39:03] marry a Moabite you could marry an
[39:05] unbeliever and they just tried that he
[39:07] tried to blend it all together until the
[39:09] children of Israel got sidetracked from
[39:11] that and instead of taking a stand for
[39:14] the word of God they failed to the
[39:16] deception of Satan's lie so
[39:18] you see how important it is to take a
[39:20] stand it's important to choose God's
[39:23] Word choose you this day whom you will
[39:25] serve God places it before us he gives
[39:30] us a choice whether we would choose him
[39:32] whether we choose his word or whether
[39:34] we'll just choose our own ideas whether
[39:36] we'll listen to the preaching of the
[39:38] gospel or where we'll just go home and
[39:40] try to figure it out on our own listen
[39:44] see Joshua was speaking to he was
[39:47] speaking we'll say he's speaking to a
[39:48] young generation hey you know III agree
[39:54] with the saying you know that the young
[39:56] people are the that they're gonna be if
[39:57] the old people it's all the older ones
[40:00] if they if they go by the grave and
[40:02] think if they don't continue on that the
[40:04] younger the all these young people are
[40:06] gonna be the next generation all these
[40:08] young people are gonna carry this gospel
[40:09] on but you know that the problem almost
[40:11] I have was saying look it's looking to
[40:13] the future and I want to look to today
[40:16] because I believe that the young people
[40:17] that are sitting here in this
[40:19] congregation or the generation that is
[40:21] going to see the dead and the dead in
[40:23] Christ rise from the ground
[40:24] I believe it you know if we keep putting
[40:27] it off putting it our believes that you
[40:28] are the generation I'm speaking to the
[40:30] young people the old people I believe
[40:31] that you are the generation that will
[40:33] not forgive it that will not prevent the
[40:35] dead in Christ from rising to the ground
[40:37] you are the ones because I believe that
[40:40] you are predestinated to stand and
[40:42] that's what I wouldn't identify you
[40:43] tonight I want to declare to you that
[40:45] you are predestinated to stand in this
[40:47] hour and the way that you're going to
[40:49] stand is because you were going to
[40:50] receive the word you're going to I've
[40:52] received the word for this hour you are
[40:53] receiving it that's why you're here
[40:55] because something is it there's a desire
[40:57] and you to hear and receive the word
[40:59] there's a desire in you to serve the
[41:01] word there's a desire you just stand for
[41:03] the word and that's what's going to
[41:05] cause the word to be made manifest in
[41:07] this a listen this is the our work this
[41:12] Laodicean our where you know every
[41:14] nobody wants to stand for anything
[41:16] everybody everybody just wants to
[41:18] believe whatever they want to believe
[41:19] and you know I believe you know young
[41:23] people old people everybody can get kind
[41:25] of caught up in that mentality that that
[41:27] whatever I think is what goes hey you
[41:29] know you can you
[41:32] so people began to start thinking I you
[41:34] know this is what I stand for and it
[41:36] creates arguments in the home and
[41:38] everything with where the parents may be
[41:39] beginning to try to lay down the law and
[41:41] lay down standards and everything and
[41:43] the young people not being born again
[41:44] yet yet kind of struggling in their own
[41:47] ideas struggling in their own mind
[41:49] saying well this this is what I stand
[41:51] for I stand for being able to do you
[41:52] notice his sleep late I was thinking
[41:55] about how brother branham he began he
[41:56] was talking about how he was struggling
[41:58] with Billy Paul when he was a young man
[41:59] he was saying Billy Paul why can't why
[42:01] can't you get up earlier before noon why
[42:04] can't you get up early before noon I you
[42:06] know brother Lewis was kind of preaching
[42:07] on that this morning he was touching on
[42:09] that how about if you consider it in you
[42:11] consider an ant how are the ant
[42:12] constantly Labor's all the insects think
[42:15] that you can go outside and see that the
[42:17] honeybee that's constantly laboring if
[42:19] you didn't labor it won't have food in
[42:21] the winter if Anne doesn't labor it
[42:22] won't have food and if you don't if you
[42:24] don't leave or you won't be able to
[42:25] provide for your family and you begin to
[42:27] think well what I stand for is just
[42:29] being able to do whatever I want
[42:30] how I stand for just being able to sleep
[42:32] till noon I stand for being up but you
[42:34] know what that's that's actually
[42:36] contrary to the Word of God you know you
[42:40] see you see what a danger it is to be
[42:42] able to hold up as the measuring stick
[42:44] for your prosperity for your success the
[42:47] measuring stick of your own life your
[42:49] own life is not the measuring stick like
[42:52] it's aruba but that built that temple
[42:53] the rouble built the temple with a
[42:55] measuring stick of god's word he held up
[42:58] the measuring stick and measured that
[42:59] said if it's not according to God's Word
[43:02] then we got to stop it we got to tear it
[43:03] down
[43:03] we got to rebuild it again and so when
[43:06] you you come to church to hold your life
[43:08] up against the measuring stick the
[43:09] mirror of God's Word and over time you
[43:12] begin to you begin to come more and more
[43:14] like the word that you're looking at in
[43:16] the Bible because you're becoming more
[43:18] and more like what you're being measured
[43:20] against but it's not yourself that
[43:22] you're being measured against you say
[43:27] well you know what I don't really see
[43:29] anything wrong with the way that that
[43:31] that that people say that we should be
[43:33] dressing I don't really see anything
[43:35] wrong with dressing in this particular
[43:37] way but God's Word says something
[43:39] different God's Word tells you how to
[43:40] dress how to line up with the measuring
[43:42] stick God's Word tells you how how that
[43:46] you know that you should not be
[43:47] corrupting your body you should not be
[43:49] smoking and chewing tobacco and all
[43:51] those different things kind of things
[43:53] why because it destroys your body it's
[43:56] destroying you and so listen I'm talking
[43:59] about taking a stand this morning you
[44:00] say why are you brother Bob why are you
[44:03] kind of hitting on o all those things is
[44:05] that really from the Word of God smoking
[44:08] and drinking and and the way to dress
[44:10] and all those things if I could turn
[44:12] over to 2nd Timothy chapter 3 first one
[44:14] to 6 where Paul's instructed Timothy
[44:17] like Josh was instructing all the young
[44:19] people he said this know also other than
[44:22] the last days perilous times shall come
[44:24] I believe that we're in the last days
[44:26] don't you for men shall be lovers of
[44:29] their own selves lovers of their own
[44:32] selves in other words just saying well
[44:33] whatever I want to do is the right way
[44:35] to do I don't really care about what the
[44:37] word says I don't really care about what
[44:39] the Bible says I don't really care about
[44:41] what the preacher says you know what all
[44:43] I care is about what makes me happy
[44:45] because if it makes me feel good if it
[44:47] makes me happy then that should be
[44:48] something that's all right and that's
[44:50] what they're measuring stick is and I
[44:52] hope that's not your measuring stick
[44:53] this evening covetous boasters proud
[44:56] blasphemers disobedient to Paris did you
[45:00] know even that being disobedient to
[45:01] parents is in the Bible
[45:03] disobedient to parents when you've got
[45:06] real godly a gril godly mother and
[45:08] father that's trying to raise you up and
[45:10] in your mind you think that you know
[45:12] better I listen I listen I'm gonna
[45:15] listen just speak frankly I wonder
[45:18] sometimes if the young people really
[45:19] know how much they owe the older ones
[45:21] love them how I've seen people around
[45:24] this church the older was weeping and
[45:26] sobbing because they're concerned about
[45:28] their young people they won't they young
[45:30] people to be saved I wonder if the young
[45:32] people really realize what a burden that
[45:35] is on the people's heart for you to be
[45:37] saved I wonder if you realize with what
[45:40] agony of what grieving the people are
[45:42] calling out to God in the middle of the
[45:43] night on the night bed crying at night
[45:46] for you to be saved
[45:48] I want to just call your attention to
[45:50] that see one day one day I believe the
[45:55] young people many young people will turn
[45:56] around and like I did I've no idea to
[45:59] turn around the baby I wish I hadn't
[46:01] acted like that when I was young I wish
[46:03] I hadn't acted all silly and everything
[46:04] like that
[46:05] disrespectful unthankful and holy Paul
[46:09] says without natural affection
[46:11] trucebreakers false accusers incontinent
[46:14] fierce despisers of those that are good
[46:17] traitors heady highminded lovers of
[46:20] pleasure more than lovers of god having
[46:22] a form of godliness but denying the
[46:24] power thereof from such turn away
[46:26] denying the power thereof what kind of
[46:29] power is there in the gospel that's the
[46:31] kind of power that can take you from
[46:32] loving yourself
[46:33] and loving your brother and sister
[46:35] that's the kind of power that can take
[46:37] you from being subservient says the
[46:38] things of the world they're giving you
[46:40] power over the world there's a kind of
[46:42] power that can give you power over that
[46:44] devil that you struggled with all your
[46:46] life and you could turn around and see
[46:48] it washed away in the sea of
[46:49] forgetfulness washed away in that red
[46:51] sea just like all the Egyptians that
[46:53] were destroyed as the Israelites crossed
[46:55] over that's the kind of power I'm
[46:57] talking about for this sort of thing
[46:59] which creep in their houses and leave
[47:00] captives silly women laden with sins led
[47:03] away with divers lusts ever learning and
[47:06] never able to come to the knowledge of
[47:08] the truth
[47:11] first I'm talking about a power that
[47:14] could make you not be ashamed of the way
[47:15] that your mama has a bun I commit a kind
[47:18] of power that could make you not be
[47:19] ashamed of your mama wearing a long
[47:21] dress gonna make you not be ashamed of
[47:23] the way that Christians around you
[47:24] talking acting things I'm talking about
[47:26] a power where you know that God is real
[47:28] and God is alive today because he's
[47:31] living in his church he's living in his
[47:33] people and he can live in you too listen
[47:38] we we try to we get to a place where we
[47:40] think well I like this particular kind
[47:42] of music and therefore it must be right
[47:44] but God can change your desire for music
[47:46] a desire cut from a kind of music that
[47:49] glorifies the flesh that glorifies the
[47:51] person that glorifies the creation and
[47:53] turns your desire to a kind of music
[47:56] that glorifies the creator yes he can
[48:00] heaven and earth will pass away but you
[48:01] you know the music the music CDs and all
[48:04] the iPods and all that would return to
[48:06] dust all this beauty of movie stars and
[48:09] everything will they don't doubt is
[48:10] beginning to sag and droop
[48:13] but satisfying the flesh will lead you
[48:16] down a road that you don't want to go
[48:18] when you become a prisoner to the devil
[48:21] but the power of the gospel can take you
[48:23] to a life eternal that never passes away
[48:26] that never dies it never goes away if by
[48:30] faith Moses brother Branham said but you
[48:32] got to choose you've got to choose and
[48:36] don't look at what you see choose what
[48:39] you see by faith that's the only thing
[48:42] that will count is what you choose my
[48:44] faith a lot as he had to make a choice
[48:47] Abraham give a lot his choice and God
[48:50] gives you your choice choose you this
[48:54] day whom serve in the Garden of Eden
[48:56] there was a tree of knowledge in the
[48:58] tree of life man was given the privilege
[49:00] to choose either one he desired and so
[49:03] is it today you're given your privilege
[49:05] as free moral agents to choose whatever
[49:08] you want to choose now I say tonight
[49:13] choose the based upon God's Word how
[49:17] will you know the right way to choose if
[49:19] you don't know God's Word if God's Word
[49:21] says don't do it then don't do it if God
[49:23] says do it didn't do it if God's will
[49:25] listen if God's Word says to come to
[49:27] church that you should be at church
[49:28] every see every single time the doors
[49:31] open and that's something we struggle
[49:33] with we say well what will my family
[49:35] think my family might be offended if I
[49:37] don't come to church listen the three
[49:39] Hebrew children did not care about
[49:41] anybody else being offended when they
[49:43] said we will not bow down to the image
[49:45] that you have erected up to the prophet
[49:47] of our day because remember that brother
[49:49] brother said that image that was erected
[49:50] that was not the image of Daniel the
[49:53] image to the prophet of their day they
[49:55] would not bow down to it and when they
[49:57] said maybe when they're saying in this
[49:58] they bow down to the image that has been
[50:00] erected to the prophet of our day do you
[50:03] care what other people think do you care
[50:05] what your family thinks when you say I
[50:07] will not back
[50:08] because listen whenever you make a stand
[50:11] it always causes conflicts conflict
[50:14] whenever you make a stand when a father
[50:18] makes us stand in his home it'll cause
[50:20] conflict a lot of times it causes
[50:22] conflict and until you know people begin
[50:25] to wonder well why why is it suddenly
[50:27] when a man gets saved when a woman can
[50:29] say why is it suddenly wrong for you to
[50:32] do this why is it suddenly wrong for
[50:34] there to be mixed bathing why is it
[50:36] suddenly wrong for you to dress in this
[50:37] particular way why is it certainly wrong
[50:39] for this and that and the other and it
[50:41] causes conflict because Jesus said in
[50:44] Matthew chapter 10 I think not that I am
[50:46] come to send peace on earth I came not
[50:49] to send peace but a sword I think
[50:51] sometimes we forget that but for I've
[50:53] come to set a man at variance against
[50:55] his father and the daughter against her
[50:57] mother as a daughter-in-law against her
[50:59] mother-in-law
[50:59] the other man's foes shall be they of
[51:01] his own household but I don't want that
[51:04] I want there to be peace and everything
[51:06] and what that means is that you're not
[51:07] willing to take a stand you're not
[51:09] willing to take a stand for the gospel
[51:11] now you know sometimes we think well
[51:13] what what the young people can't make a
[51:14] stand if their parents haven't been
[51:17] living right I remember the story in the
[51:19] Bible of Josiah who was crowned when he
[51:21] I believe he was about eight years old
[51:22] and his father had been living wrong his
[51:24] father had been living evil but when he
[51:27] was crowned they put that crown upon
[51:29] little Josiah's head he began to say he
[51:31] put he began to possess that it's harder
[51:34] desire to live true to God and begin to
[51:36] tear down all the altars that they had
[51:39] erected to bail he began to tear down
[51:40] everything that they had erected and I
[51:42] believe a young person in this day in
[51:44] this hour when they hear the truth
[51:46] coming across the pulpit they can go
[51:48] home and they could take their Danny's
[51:49] pornographic magazines throw them out of
[51:51] the house they could take the all the
[51:53] filth that their mama's been living all
[51:55] that all that makeup and everything
[51:56] that's thrown out of the house when you
[51:58] hear the gospel for yourself you can
[52:00] live it whether or not whether or not it
[52:02] may be anybody else has even been living
[52:04] around you because it's a personal
[52:06] experience you've got to choose for
[52:09] yourself you've got to be the one
[52:11] choosing you've got to choose right in
[52:16] Rome now I'm a flip-flop I'm a bear so
[52:20] hang on
[52:26] cuz it's not really you that doesn't use
[52:29] it you do the accepted right listen I
[52:34] was talking to talking to my kids after
[52:37] they get back from camps and things and
[52:39] I'm not bashing this so this is a
[52:40] problem all across life not just two
[52:42] camps but you see all these little girls
[52:44] they won't they won't they won't to be
[52:47] the one to choose a boy and then go
[52:49] taking this cell phone they go run it
[52:50] all over the place take my number call
[52:53] me get my Instagram or whatever and you
[52:55] see that's backwards
[52:56] that's that listen if nobody else has
[52:58] never told you that before I'm telling
[52:59] you I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna preach
[53:01] it because listen listen demand is the
[53:08] one that chooses the man and the gospel
[53:10] is the one that chooses ya even in the
[53:12] gospel the people are always running
[53:14] people just like Adam in the garden he
[53:16] was the one running and the man Christ
[53:18] Jesus was the one that chose Christ
[53:21] Jesus is the one that came running after
[53:23] him he was choosing him he wanted him he
[53:25] was looking at his character he was
[53:27] looking I won't you look that's the way
[53:30] a man that's the way any man wants to
[53:32] choose a bride that's the way any man a
[53:34] real man wants to choose a wife he's
[53:36] looking for character he's looking for
[53:39] his ain't not looking for just some kind
[53:40] of some kind of shapely something that
[53:42] can walk in a particular way to satisfy
[53:44] the lust of the flesh he's not looking
[53:46] for somebody to just take us on her on
[53:48] her high-heeled shoes going this way and
[53:49] that but he's looking for character and
[53:52] that's the same thing that God is
[53:53] looking for and you he's looking for
[53:55] character why do you think that I has
[53:57] you eros chose ester when she presented
[53:58] herself without any costly apparel
[54:00] without all pearls and all kind of
[54:02] dolled up with makeup and everything but
[54:04] he said I see and you something
[54:06] priceless I see a real character at you
[54:08] and that's why she was chosen to be his
[54:10] queen God is the one that does the
[54:13] choosing God is the one that does the
[54:15] choosing you see he's the one that's
[54:20] knocking at the door of your heart and
[54:22] listen you either you either accept or
[54:25] reject you are the one that says yes
[54:27] I'll open it up or I will shut the door
[54:30] you
[54:31] that accepts the one that is choosing
[54:33] the one that is choosing you and we'll
[54:35] get to how he chooses in a minute
[54:36] because you're chosen in him you've been
[54:38] chosen in him before the foundation of
[54:40] the world but I just want to talk about
[54:41] another example in the Bible remember
[54:44] when when when Isaac began Isaac the man
[54:47] and he began to won't I need a wife and
[54:50] so this story is very very different
[54:52] than the way that it normally works he
[54:54] says somebody else
[54:55] son look like somebody else to go find
[54:58] him or wife he said Eliezer the the
[55:01] messenger look just like the Prophet in
[55:03] this thing you didn't hear it straight
[55:05] from Jesus's Christ Jesus Christ lips
[55:07] you heard it from a prophet messengers
[55:10] lips just like Rebecca heard it from
[55:12] eleazar's lips but you can see how even
[55:15] in this situation as Eliezer went up to
[55:18] well how am I gonna find a wife for my
[55:21] for my master how am I gonna fight you
[55:24] can see the Spirit of the Living God
[55:26] moving upon the scene and that's it this
[55:28] is what I want to get to tonight it's
[55:30] God's Spirit drawing you listen a man
[55:33] can get up behind a pulpit and preach a
[55:35] good sermon but unless God comes and
[55:37] draws and yet speaks to your heart
[55:39] you'll just sit there like a rock along
[55:41] you'll just sit there like a toady frog
[55:43] you won't make more one move but when
[55:46] God begins to speak to your heart
[55:48] something's got to happen and you can
[55:50] see let's go to Genesis chapter 24 as
[55:54] Eliezer will begin to begin to cry out
[55:57] to God he said behold I stand here by
[56:00] the will of water in that interesting
[56:01] that Jesus so so many women in the Bible
[56:04] met the Savior in a well of water i
[56:07] standing here by the whale of water and
[56:09] the daughters of the men of the city
[56:10] come out to draw water and let it come
[56:13] to pass that the damsel to whom I shall
[56:15] say let down that pitcher I praise thee
[56:18] that I may drink and she shall say drink
[56:21] and I will give that camels drink also
[56:23] let the same be she that thou hast
[56:25] appointed for thy servant Isaac and
[56:27] thereby shall I know that thou has
[56:29] showed kindness unto my master and it
[56:32] came to pass before he had done speaking
[56:33] before he had done speaking the Holy
[56:36] Spirit was already working on the scene
[56:39] the Holy Spirit was already moving on
[56:41] her moving on this predestinated it
[56:44] Brian
[56:44] of Isaac to come and fulfill prophecy
[56:48] you say brother Bob what's that got to
[56:50] do with your sermon I believe that the
[56:51] Holy Spirit is moving in this
[56:53] congregation right now moving to fulfill
[56:55] prophecy you are you are fulfilling a
[56:58] vision you are in a vision right now you
[57:00] are fulfilling the Word of God right now
[57:02] because I believe that God that same
[57:04] spirit that moved on Rebekah I believe
[57:06] that that same spirit is right now in
[57:08] this building speaking to your heart
[57:09] moving upon your subconscious moving
[57:12] upon your secret desires causing you to
[57:14] realize speaking back that that is the
[57:16] truth that's nothing but the truth
[57:21] behold Rebekah came out who was born to
[57:23] Bethel well son of Milcah the wife of
[57:25] Nahor Abraham's brother with her picture
[57:27] upon her shoulder and the damsel was
[57:29] very fair to look upon a virgin neither
[57:31] had any man known her and she went down
[57:34] to the well and filled her pitcher and
[57:35] came up and the servant ran to meet her
[57:37] and said let me I pray thee drink a
[57:39] little water of that picture but she
[57:41] said drink my lord and she hasted and
[57:43] let down her pitcher upon her hand and
[57:45] gave him drink and when she had doesn't
[57:48] giving him drink I wonder if he was
[57:49] sitting there thinking well what's gonna
[57:51] happen next with the rest of my petition
[57:53] be fulfilled even in my sight well the
[57:56] rest of it be be made manifest as she
[57:59] then she said I will draw water for thy
[58:01] camels also until they have done
[58:04] drinking and I know it's been
[58:05] Illustrated many times how much the
[58:07] camel drinks do you see how how amazing
[58:09] this was for her to say I will water
[58:11] your camels also because a camel you
[58:13] don't just give it a glass of water you
[58:15] just don't just even pull up one
[58:17] bucketful
[58:17] well this is a very thirsty camel make
[58:20] drink up to 32 gallons of water in 13
[58:23] minutes another and think about that
[58:25] long line of camels in other words this
[58:27] was something miraculous still was
[58:29] taking place this was something amazing
[58:31] that was taking place
[58:32] he didn't just ask for some little
[58:34] piddly thing like like listen a lot of
[58:37] the young people today they want to put
[58:39] all their marriage on some of the
[58:40] penalty things that they know I had this
[58:42] little piddly dream I had this little
[58:44] something and you don't base anything
[58:46] upon the Word of God you don't you don't
[58:47] go back to the word to see whether or
[58:49] not you should be getting married or not
[58:50] but I said I've had that thrown up in my
[58:52] face I know a lot of you
[58:53] my testimony how I did have a dream
[58:55] before I saw my wife I saw my wife in a
[58:58] dream but I'm not saying that to make
[58:59] anything of myself I'm saying it to lay
[59:01] that beggar but to put the record
[59:03] straight because I did not go to my wife
[59:05] and say listen I had a dream now you got
[59:08] to marry me let's enough dangle that
[59:10] dream all in her face like that listen I
[59:12] had a dream see how spiritual I am look
[59:14] at this I believe that God can direct
[59:16] your path but he don't direct your path
[59:18] so that you can go manipulate somebody
[59:20] like that he don't go do that so that
[59:22] you can just dangle it in front of about
[59:23] somebody so you could say show how
[59:25] spiritual is how great you are listen
[59:27] there is a real true call of God in
[59:30] people's life there is reals a real move
[59:32] of the Holy Spirit in God's life and if
[59:34] God really does show you by revelation
[59:37] who you should marry then you hang on to
[59:38] that and hold it down in your heart and
[59:40] do like Eleazar and said if it is true
[59:42] that God will bring it to pass and if it
[59:45] is not true then maybe God maybe God
[59:48] didn't show me that think of it that way
[59:50] but listen I've seen so many so many
[59:55] situations I would listen I was talking
[59:57] to a pastor of another church I would
[59:59] just put this out there and he said he
[1:00:00] said I've had so many men come up to my
[1:00:03] daughters and say God showed me in a
[1:00:05] dream that I should be marrying Yuni and
[1:00:07] he asked one of them how many other
[1:00:09] girls did you tell that to and he said
[1:00:10] seven seven that you told that God had
[1:00:13] spoke to you and told you to marry marry
[1:00:15] my daughter listen
[1:00:16] oh I we made you a bunch of foolishness
[1:00:19] there's so much foolishness going on I
[1:00:21] would encourage you to be wise in the
[1:00:23] gospel be wise as a serpent and harmless
[1:00:25] as a dove but gird up your loins to know
[1:00:28] whether what's truth and what's a lie
[1:00:30] listen I just got coming to where listen
[1:00:34] if nobody else was saying I'm fixin to
[1:00:36] just lay it out there I believe that you
[1:00:38] need to sit down with your kids and lay
[1:00:40] it out there so that they know what's
[1:00:41] truth and what's right lay it out there
[1:00:43] so they're not let astray by all kinds
[1:00:45] of gobbledygook could all kind of
[1:00:46] nonsense
[1:00:47] all kind of Filth and perversion to
[1:00:49] people some some young man that's not
[1:00:51] even filled with the Holy Ghost all
[1:00:53] these goddamn is there is some lustful
[1:00:55] spirit comes sniffing around your girls
[1:00:57] and everything and wounded wanting to
[1:01:00] come up and egg
[1:01:06] listen it's time it's time to be real I
[1:01:08] mean it's time to be real it's time to
[1:01:12] stand for something it's time to stand
[1:01:13] for truth it's time to stand for
[1:01:15] something that's real in this hour look
[1:01:28] see see how it's saying it earlier only
[1:01:31] you cut to it's time for you to take a
[1:01:32] stand it's time and you can't make the
[1:01:35] right stand without God moving on you
[1:01:39] moving on you two to do that I think so
[1:01:44] many times you know it frustrates those
[1:01:46] parents and everything will well we
[1:01:48] started fussing and everything about why
[1:01:50] you listen to that music why are you
[1:01:51] doing such a thing why do you not
[1:01:53] understand why you should not dress this
[1:01:54] particular way you don't understand all
[1:01:57] these things but you cannot understand
[1:01:58] unless it's revealed because it's
[1:02:00] sovereignly revealed you cannot
[1:02:02] understand unless the Spirit of God
[1:02:04] comes and speaks to you and that's why
[1:02:06] in John chapter 6 245 it says no man
[1:02:09] could come to me except the Father which
[1:02:11] hath sent me draw him and I will raise
[1:02:13] him up at the last day it is written in
[1:02:16] the prophets and they shall be all
[1:02:17] taught of God of God every man therefore
[1:02:22] that hath heard and hath learned of the
[1:02:24] Father cometh unto me every man that has
[1:02:28] heard and learned of the Father cometh
[1:02:29] unto me and you know I think sometimes
[1:02:32] we get a sinner in our head when we when
[1:02:34] we read this scripture that no man could
[1:02:36] come to me except the father that's it
[1:02:39] which has sent me draw him though no man
[1:02:41] can come we look at that as a negative
[1:02:43] thing
[1:02:43] no man well I may as well not even try
[1:02:46] no man can come but do you all I want to
[1:02:49] flip that around and look at it real
[1:02:50] positive this evening because that means
[1:02:52] that no man can come unless the father
[1:02:54] draws him then that means that when the
[1:02:56] preacher gets I'm about behind the
[1:02:58] pulpit and something goes the word in
[1:03:00] your heart when you hear going in the
[1:03:02] mall berry bush that's not because of
[1:03:04] the preacher that's going you but that's
[1:03:06] because of a living God that speaking to
[1:03:08] your heart I want to identify that for
[1:03:10] you tonight that when the preaching goes
[1:03:12] forth and something in your heart says
[1:03:14] that's the truth
[1:03:15] the truth open up the door of your heart
[1:03:17] that's the living God moving upon the
[1:03:19] moving upon your heart I wonder all of
[1:03:22] you older ones that have been born again
[1:03:23] if you could look back this morning and
[1:03:25] remember when God first began to draw at
[1:03:27] your heart I remember when he first
[1:03:30] began to draw at mine hey listen how I
[1:03:32] grew up in a message home I grew up on
[1:03:35] Cigna I said it a message home I we had
[1:03:37] tapes playing all the time I remember I
[1:03:41] remember when my dad will go out and get
[1:03:44] the tape boxes that were shipped every
[1:03:46] once a month or however often there were
[1:03:47] and with joy and he would open up the
[1:03:50] tape and put the tape in and and open up
[1:03:52] the books and sit there reading for
[1:03:53] hours but do you think I did do you
[1:03:56] think I wanted to do that no because the
[1:03:58] father had not drawn me yet and I would
[1:04:00] sit there at when we went over long car
[1:04:02] rides and my parents would constantly be
[1:04:04] playing the tapes we would have
[1:04:06] devotionals every night in my home my
[1:04:08] parents was sit around and talk to us
[1:04:10] and read stories from the Bible and
[1:04:11] explain to us every single night and
[1:04:14] that's one thing where I would like to
[1:04:15] growing up as I've called it finally
[1:04:17] kind of falling short to be honest but
[1:04:20] my dad did it every single night when we
[1:04:24] were on vacation when we were at my
[1:04:26] grandma's house every single night he
[1:04:29] was constantly having devotionals but do
[1:04:31] you think I ran headlong after the
[1:04:33] gospel not until the father drawled me
[1:04:36] but one day I was walking with my dad as
[1:04:38] we went after after church we were
[1:04:40] walking down this disa
[1:04:42] through the wheat fields as they were
[1:04:44] growing I believe it was a wheat I was
[1:04:45] some kind of crop and even getting to
[1:04:47] talk about the future home of the
[1:04:48] heavenly bride and the heavenly
[1:04:50] bridegroom in the earthly bride and
[1:04:51] began to talk about that and and and it
[1:04:54] wasn't just the words that he said but
[1:04:56] something began to speak down on the
[1:04:58] inside of my heart and when I got home I
[1:05:01] could not put down the tapes I could not
[1:05:04] put it down
[1:05:04] I ran headlong to the message I was
[1:05:07] talking to another brother years ago he
[1:05:09] was testifying of how when he heard that
[1:05:11] call he said I read the entire Bible in
[1:05:13] a weekend the entire Bible in a weekend
[1:05:17] listen that's that's that's running like
[1:05:19] a large after a half serious
[1:05:22] the entire Bible from cover to cover
[1:05:25] why because something that got ahold of
[1:05:28] him and it wasn't just to preach it from
[1:05:29] behind the pulpit but it was a living
[1:05:31] God and that's what I want to get to you
[1:05:33] tonight is that there is a living God
[1:05:35] movie there are angels and kept around
[1:05:37] the palace that you can't see there's a
[1:05:39] living God speaking to your heart right
[1:05:41] now and he's calling from an unseen
[1:05:42] realm he's calling you to look look past
[1:05:45] the things that you see look past the
[1:05:47] things that your two eyes could behold
[1:05:49] and look past look to see what God has
[1:05:54] waiting for you
[1:05:55] he's calling he's drawing you see
[1:06:03] because that's how that's how he's done
[1:06:05] everywhere remember Paul in the Bible
[1:06:07] Paul ran he thought that he thought he
[1:06:10] was doing the right thing by running
[1:06:12] after Steven and killing him by
[1:06:14] persecuting Christians by running a
[1:06:16] throw up but then one day and listen to
[1:06:18] how it has worded in Acts chapter 2
[1:06:20] verse 36 2/3 I'm sorry I snapped ur 9
[1:06:23] and he said in Acts chapter 9 verse 4
[1:06:25] and he said he fell to the earth and
[1:06:27] heard a voice saying unto Him Saul Saul
[1:06:30] why persecutest thou me and he said 'who
[1:06:33] out the art that Lord and the Lord said
[1:06:35] I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is
[1:06:38] hard for thee to kick against the pricks
[1:06:40] it's the heart for thee to kiss kick
[1:06:42] against the pricks who are you who is
[1:06:44] pricking him who was prick and Paul was
[1:06:48] it wasn't it Steven so much when he saw
[1:06:50] him dying there no it was it was a
[1:06:52] spirit of a living God speaking to his
[1:06:54] heart cricketing but listen what they
[1:06:56] said on the day of Pentecost in Acts
[1:06:58] chapter 2 verse 36 and 37
[1:07:00] therefore I Peter said therefore let all
[1:07:02] the house of Israel know assuredly that
[1:07:04] God hath made that same Jesus whom ye
[1:07:06] have crucified both Lord and Christ now
[1:07:09] when they heard this they were pricked
[1:07:10] in their heart and said unto Peter and
[1:07:13] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:07:15] brethren what shall we do and wrought
[1:07:17] while all around about him all the
[1:07:19] Pharisees and Sadducees were standing
[1:07:21] there or I don't see nothing special
[1:07:23] about this but they were pricked in
[1:07:25] their heart why because the father had
[1:07:28] spoken to them it was God on the inside
[1:07:30] calling to them God revealed
[1:07:33] that there's something real about this
[1:07:35] when they begin to realize that these
[1:07:37] are these men are drunken with wine
[1:07:38] there's some kind of supernatural
[1:07:40] stimulation there's something
[1:07:42] supernatural going on and God spoke down
[1:07:44] on the inside of their heart this is
[1:07:46] true this is real where is he calling
[1:07:54] from he called he called Saul by name
[1:07:58] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me
[1:08:02] saw saw do you know what he's calling
[1:08:06] you by name tonight he's calling you by
[1:08:09] name because when you when you hear that
[1:08:11] gospel call and buy the gospel call I'm
[1:08:13] not just talking about a preacher from
[1:08:15] behind the pulpit but I'm talking about
[1:08:17] the Spirit of God calling your name he's
[1:08:19] calling from eternity because he knew
[1:08:21] why he knew you before the foundation of
[1:08:24] the world he knew you he saw you he knew
[1:08:26] that you would be sitting in this
[1:08:28] service tonight
[1:08:29] he knew whether you would be asleep or
[1:08:30] whether you would be awake he knew
[1:08:32] whether your ears will be open he knew
[1:08:34] whether you would be receptive
[1:08:35] he knew whether you would want it or not
[1:08:37] and so it was predestinated into him
[1:08:39] before the foundation of the world and
[1:08:41] that's how you were chosen in him you
[1:08:43] were chosen in him he chose Christ Jesus
[1:08:46] and because you were in him before the
[1:08:48] foundation of the world he also chose
[1:08:50] you you were chosen in him well how were
[1:08:54] you chosen in him because in John
[1:08:55] chapter 12 32 is has an eye if I be
[1:08:58] lifted up from the earth will draw all
[1:08:59] men unto me o men what kind of meal in
[1:09:04] Genesis chapter 1 26 27 that said God
[1:09:07] said let us make man in our image after
[1:09:09] our likeness and let them have dominion
[1:09:12] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:09:13] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[1:09:15] over all the earth and over every
[1:09:16] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:09:18] earth so God created man in his own
[1:09:20] image in the image of God created he him
[1:09:23] male and female created he them and you
[1:09:26] were there back then you were there as
[1:09:28] an attribute back then and he
[1:09:30] new you you were predestinated into him
[1:09:32] before the foundation of the world so
[1:09:34] that when he died on the cross he could
[1:09:36] look forward in time and know that one
[1:09:37] day you would receive it like he prayed
[1:09:39] for you in John chapter 17 like who in
[1:09:42] John chapter 12 it says if I be lifted
[1:09:44] up from the earth will draw all men unto
[1:09:46] me and now he's drawing you you that
[1:09:49] were predestinated to hear this gospel
[1:09:51] before the foundation of the world he's
[1:09:53] drawing you to himself he's drawing you
[1:09:56] back to the eternal and how is he
[1:09:58] drawing because when you hear the
[1:10:00] preaching of the gospel then and the
[1:10:03] preaching of the gospel is true when
[1:10:05] truth is preached because the Spirit of
[1:10:08] God can hover over that word hover over
[1:10:11] you and say and point back to that and
[1:10:13] say that's the truth brother Branham it
[1:10:15] will be his head the response would be
[1:10:17] just as simple as just raising your hand
[1:10:19] will you raise your hand all the people
[1:10:21] in the congregation that he brother
[1:10:23] Branham would be talking to stand up
[1:10:25] from your seat raise your hand all of
[1:10:27] those things because listen see how you
[1:10:30] cannot raise your hand without something
[1:10:34] spiritual taking place
[1:10:35] why because Ezekiel chapter Ezekiel
[1:10:38] chapter I believe it's 30 36 says that
[1:10:41] you've got a stony heart he's got to
[1:10:43] soften up your heart so that he can he's
[1:10:45] got to soften up your heart by the
[1:10:46] revealing of the word without a soft
[1:10:48] heart you just sit there all stony-faced
[1:10:50] like like like a little toady froggy
[1:10:52] gonna leave you just sit there staring
[1:10:54] at the preacher but when God begins to
[1:10:56] move upon you like he moved upon the
[1:10:58] water in Genesis when he moved upon the
[1:11:00] water and calls that see that
[1:11:01] predestinated see that had been laying
[1:11:03] there brother I said from another
[1:11:04] civilization an eternal civilization
[1:11:07] when that Spirit of God began to move
[1:11:09] upon that seed the seed came up and
[1:11:12] that's what he's doing now he's moving
[1:11:13] upon that a predestinate his seed in
[1:11:16] your life and he's gonna cause it to
[1:11:18] come up he's calling it he come up from
[1:11:20] the mud and the muck and the mire until
[1:11:22] there's a birth that takes place because
[1:11:27] what Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 says
[1:11:29] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:11:31] before the foundation of the world that
[1:11:33] we should be holy and without blame
[1:11:36] before him in love having predestinated
[1:11:38] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:11:40] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:11:43] good place
[1:11:43] his will he's chosen us in him my that
[1:11:47] should make every believer so happy
[1:11:48] today that should make every believer so
[1:11:50] happy to realize that God has spoken to
[1:11:53] you on a one-to-one basis he came down
[1:11:57] he saw so much of you hey valued you so
[1:12:00] much that he sent his spirit into the
[1:12:01] church so that he could speak to you so
[1:12:04] that he could commend you you know they
[1:12:06] were talking about that young man that
[1:12:07] just killed himself up there I III I
[1:12:10] wonder you you you want to just get
[1:12:12] across to all the young people all the
[1:12:14] people in the world if you could realize
[1:12:16] with what value you have the value your
[1:12:20] soul is worth ten billion trillion
[1:12:22] world's your soul is worth that much to
[1:12:26] God and God is worth so much that he
[1:12:29] came down and died for you and died for
[1:12:31] you so that he could send his spirit
[1:12:33] back on the day of Pentecost and speak
[1:12:35] to you in communion with you on a
[1:12:36] one-to-one basis that's how much God
[1:12:38] cares for you but you see with the devil
[1:12:40] the devil tries to get in there and tell
[1:12:42] people that they're worthless and they
[1:12:44] don't have any value and and all that
[1:12:45] kind of things someone all kind of
[1:12:47] discord like that all brothers and
[1:12:49] sisters constantly tell they tell your
[1:12:51] children constantly tell you young
[1:12:53] people how much you love them be salty
[1:12:55] to be so salty to them that will make
[1:12:57] them thirsty be salty to one another
[1:12:59] that will though don't let the salt lose
[1:13:03] its savor be so salty and sweet and
[1:13:05] wonderful and kind to one another
[1:13:07] that'll make everybody just long to be a
[1:13:09] Christian everybody long to have what
[1:13:10] you got that's that's my prayer for
[1:13:13] myself you know I know many times I've
[1:13:15] fallen I've failed I failed of that I've
[1:13:18] failed as a father so many times but
[1:13:20] listen the mistakes that we made many
[1:13:22] times we make mistakes raising our
[1:13:24] children many times we make mistakes but
[1:13:26] there is a God that can come upon the
[1:13:28] scene just like Josiah that was raised
[1:13:29] wrong and he can patch everything up and
[1:13:32] make all things new
[1:13:33] he can he can straighten everything up
[1:13:37] maybe sometimes it's good for the for
[1:13:39] the young people to see mistakes in our
[1:13:41] lives to realize that there's no good at
[1:13:42] us just because people people think with
[1:13:45] a you're a minister you must be all
[1:13:47] perfect and everything listen ministers
[1:13:49] have more problems than anybody else
[1:13:50] because the devil won't save more
[1:13:52] problems but the devil's got all of his
[1:13:54] guns trained on you to constantly hinder
[1:13:56] you
[1:13:57] you can't study or things I'm talking
[1:13:59] about it but Meyer you hear about all
[1:14:01] these pastures are all around that the
[1:14:03] devil will try to attack their kids and
[1:14:05] get them running off to get married and
[1:14:07] all these kind of things listen we
[1:14:09] should be praying one for another
[1:14:10] praying one for another diligently I
[1:14:18] don't know why I got off on that but
[1:14:20] anyway listen let's just it's been 45
[1:14:29] minutes so I'm trying to come to a close
[1:14:30] here you think about all the ones in the
[1:14:35] scripture that that didn't know hardly
[1:14:37] anything about the gospel and maybe
[1:14:40] their hearts were cold but then God came
[1:14:43] on the scene to begin speaking down on
[1:14:44] the inside of there speaking to them
[1:14:46] revealing himself to them calling them
[1:14:50] just like little merry little 16 year
[1:14:53] old Mary one day she was walking just to
[1:14:55] do about her own business and an angel
[1:14:57] came to deliver her a message that and
[1:14:58] he began to expound to her about how
[1:15:00] Isaiah Isaiah had prophesied that the
[1:15:02] Virgin shall conceive and she said well
[1:15:04] how is this going to be and he said well
[1:15:06] well the Holy Ghost is gonna come upon
[1:15:09] thee and the power of the highest shall
[1:15:11] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:15:14] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:15:15] be called the son of God
[1:15:17] see she heard a message she heard the
[1:15:20] message from the angel but you see it
[1:15:22] takes the Spirit of God to come and
[1:15:23] speak to you it takes the Spirit of God
[1:15:26] to come and quicken it without the
[1:15:27] spirit I was talking about in Sunday
[1:15:29] school this morning without the Holy
[1:15:30] Ghost where this is just a gathering
[1:15:32] without the Holy Ghost and many times
[1:15:35] you can you can begin to just look at
[1:15:36] the natural and you begin to lose sight
[1:15:39] that there is a Holy Ghost moving in the
[1:15:41] church
[1:15:42] maybe maybe sometimes many ministers as
[1:15:45] they stand from behind the pulpit you
[1:15:47] begin to look out to people as Louise
[1:15:49] was was expanding this morning and see
[1:15:51] people seem like they're not desperate
[1:15:53] anymore their eyes are have clothes that
[1:15:55] can barely stay awake and it seems like
[1:15:57] they don't even really want it anymore
[1:15:59] is there a hunger for the gospel anymore
[1:16:02] and you begin to end the natural and the
[1:16:04] natural you begin to think well maybe
[1:16:05] nothing's going on but realize that that
[1:16:08] God that Hebrews 13:8 says that he's the
[1:16:11] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:16:14] that God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
[1:16:16] is still moving in his people he's still
[1:16:18] working he's still doing things he's
[1:16:22] still calling his people they see you
[1:16:28] see it's not the preacher going you
[1:16:30] though it's not the preacher it's the
[1:16:33] Holy Ghost that's doing the drawing
[1:16:34] remember in 1st Samuel chapter 2 it says
[1:16:37] talking about how that that little
[1:16:40] Samuel lay in there at night when the
[1:16:42] Spirit of God came and began to minister
[1:16:44] to him and it says an air the lamp of
[1:16:46] God went out in the temple of the Lord
[1:16:47] where the Ark of God was the same it was
[1:16:50] laid down to sleep that the Lord called
[1:16:52] Samuel and he answered here am I and you
[1:16:55] see what Samuel thought it was he
[1:16:57] thought he thought it was the priest he
[1:16:59] thought it was the priests dog and
[1:17:01] that's what I want to call to your
[1:17:02] attention identify when you when you get
[1:17:04] a little idea something begins to stir
[1:17:06] down on the inside of your heart that's
[1:17:08] that's God speaking to you and the only
[1:17:11] thing for you to do is just quickly run
[1:17:13] and respond and he ran into Eli instead
[1:17:15] hear him I for that cost me and he said
[1:17:18] I called not lie down again and he went
[1:17:20] and lay down and the Lord called in
[1:17:21] again Samuel as Samuel arose and went to
[1:17:24] Eli and said here am I for thou call us
[1:17:26] me and he answered I call not my son lie
[1:17:28] down again now Samuel did not yet know
[1:17:31] the Lord just like so many of us the
[1:17:33] first time we heard God so maybe we need
[1:17:36] a little bit of extra destruction and
[1:17:38] maybe that's why I'm preaching this
[1:17:40] tonight to identify the Holy Ghost
[1:17:42] calling you when the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:44] speaking to you that's the Holy Ghost
[1:17:46] revealing to you trying to come in and
[1:17:49] knock it on the door of your heart
[1:17:50] neither was the word of the Lord yet
[1:17:53] revealed unto you and the Lord called
[1:17:55] Samuel again the third time and he arose
[1:17:58] and went to Eli and said here am I for
[1:18:00] thou just call me and and Eli perceived
[1:18:03] that the Lord had called the child
[1:18:05] because you see it's the Lord calling
[1:18:08] you may the conference with God in 1960
[1:18:11] brother have said talk it over with him
[1:18:13] tonight friend just a few words will
[1:18:15] mean so much let's bow our heads just a
[1:18:18] moment now I'd like for each one of you
[1:18:19] to think in your heart am i worth
[1:18:21] anything
[1:18:21] sure you are God loves you look what he
[1:18:24] came for you oh how do I know he will
[1:18:27] receive you the very thought of you
[1:18:30] recognizing that you're wrong is the
[1:18:33] fact that Christ is dealing with you he
[1:18:36] said no man could have come to me except
[1:18:38] my father draws him first
[1:18:39] that shows that God's right near you
[1:18:42] drawing you he wants to hold a little
[1:18:45] conference with you there in your seat
[1:18:47] or standing around in the aisle in the
[1:18:50] wall or outside leaning against the
[1:18:52] building or out in your cars the Holy
[1:18:55] Spirit oh I know as sin was simple I've
[1:18:57] heard that before you but it's the truth
[1:18:59] he wants to hold a little conference
[1:19:02] with you now and just talk it over with
[1:19:04] you I wonder if you've ever ever had a
[1:19:07] little conference with God before I
[1:19:09] think that's one thing that may be so
[1:19:11] like it in so many of our lives I'll
[1:19:13] tell you that's one thing that's been
[1:19:14] lacking in my life because you get so
[1:19:16] concerned with all the things around you
[1:19:19] get so concerned with your job or how
[1:19:21] long it takes to get to work and
[1:19:22] everything that you forget to commune
[1:19:25] with God and forget that he's drawing
[1:19:27] you but listen you know you know that's
[1:19:29] why people people get in their hand well
[1:19:31] this church brother Dale and brother
[1:19:33] waiting there by their there it gets
[1:19:34] altar calls there gets people coming up
[1:19:36] and giving their life to the Lord no
[1:19:37] nobody's not against giving their life
[1:19:39] to the Lord
[1:19:40] nobody's against the altars against
[1:19:43] altar calls if it's the man drawing you
[1:19:45] if it's the man saying come up trying to
[1:19:47] pluck away at your emotions and things
[1:19:50] which well what what don't you think you
[1:19:53] saw your brother or your sister come up
[1:19:54] the other day or whatever it might be
[1:19:56] well don't you think you ought to come
[1:19:57] up now too and you see what it ends up
[1:19:59] doing is it doesn't do anything people
[1:20:01] get this misconceived notion of what
[1:20:04] what it really is to come to the Lord
[1:20:06] they think they begin to think like
[1:20:08] Samuel did that it was the priests draw
[1:20:10] on them instead of waiting on waiting on
[1:20:13] God to do the drawing but you see we
[1:20:15] believe in altars we believe we believe
[1:20:17] like Abel back in the with brother I'm
[1:20:19] explaining here he put himself on that
[1:20:21] altar with his sacrifice and identified
[1:20:24] himself with that lamb that he offered
[1:20:26] up he put himself on that altar and he
[1:20:28] died himself and I believe it or died
[1:20:30] out whether it's in your car whether
[1:20:32] it's in the
[1:20:32] yeah on the bus to work whether it's
[1:20:35] whether is in your pew at church I
[1:20:36] believe in a diet out but it's got to be
[1:20:39] God that does the drawing
[1:20:40] you remember how brother Brandon begins
[1:20:42] to he kind of got on one of his Deacons
[1:20:44] when when he went up there brother Billy
[1:20:46] Paul after Billy Paul had gone through
[1:20:48] all that trial or gambling and all that
[1:20:49] all the different things that he got up
[1:20:51] got involved with and he can win up and
[1:20:54] kind of tapped him on the shoulder don't
[1:20:56] you think it's time don't you think you
[1:20:57] need to be up there at the altar when
[1:21:00] that when the Spirit of the Lord was
[1:21:01] moving and brother Branham came by later
[1:21:03] and he said you can't do that you can't
[1:21:05] just you can't you can't force anybody
[1:21:07] in any way because then it's the priest
[1:21:10] then it's the person then it's the man
[1:21:11] it can't be the man it's got to be God
[1:21:13] doing the drawing because then when it's
[1:21:15] God doing the drawing it's something
[1:21:18] real it's something real like we were
[1:21:20] talking this morning about it and in
[1:21:23] Sunday school what yes any school what
[1:21:28] is the Holy Ghost the real baptism of
[1:21:31] the Holy Ghost is a personal revelation
[1:21:32] of Jesus Christ personal to you and that
[1:21:35] is the calling of God that is the
[1:21:36] drawing of God God revealing himself to
[1:21:39] you he reveals himself to you that he
[1:21:41] has justified you he reveals that you
[1:21:44] need something's wrong in your life he
[1:21:45] reveals that you need to be sanctified
[1:21:47] and he reveals to you that you can be
[1:21:50] sanctified and you began to feast on the
[1:21:52] word and you begin to eat the word and
[1:21:54] he begins to reveal it to you and till
[1:21:56] it pushes out and pushes out but it's
[1:21:58] not the man behind the pulpit and it's
[1:22:00] not your mama and daddy it's God doing
[1:22:02] the drawing it's God doing the revealing
[1:22:05] and then it becomes something real you
[1:22:06] see then it becomes something somebody
[1:22:10] nobody can take away from you because
[1:22:11] it's God on the inside doing the work
[1:22:17] you see psalm 42 7 says deep brother
[1:22:21] brahma used to always reach on this so
[1:22:23] many times deep calling earth under deep
[1:22:25] with the noise of thought water spouse
[1:22:27] all of our waves and thy billows are
[1:22:30] going over me you ever you ever
[1:22:31] experienced that when you just get in
[1:22:33] the presence of the lord so much until
[1:22:35] he's just wafting over you and he's
[1:22:37] speaking to you and communing with you
[1:22:39] and you know what it means to have a
[1:22:41] deep calling to your deep a deep the
[1:22:44] soul of god in communion with your soul
[1:22:46] something
[1:22:46] something draw and you something
[1:22:48] speaking to you something and you know
[1:22:50] what that does it puts you it puts you
[1:22:52] into a state of desperation cuz listen
[1:22:55] I'll be closing on this in a minute let
[1:22:58] me just bear with me just a moment cuz I
[1:23:00] got to get this out y'all when God
[1:23:03] begins to speak to you when God began to
[1:23:05] speak to me as I was walking with my dad
[1:23:07] they put me into a state of desperation
[1:23:09] that there's something out there that I
[1:23:12] don't have that I need there's an made
[1:23:14] me thirsty it made me realize what that
[1:23:18] thirst was awful all of a sudden and the
[1:23:20] only way to quench that thirst was to
[1:23:22] get into the word to get into fellowship
[1:23:25] with God to pray and seek Him to long
[1:23:27] for him to get into communion with him
[1:23:29] it made me desperate and listen you're
[1:23:32] gonna see you can preach a sermon about
[1:23:34] you need to be desperate you need to be
[1:23:36] desperate and you do need to be
[1:23:37] desperate but it's only God that can
[1:23:39] make you desperate but when God begins
[1:23:41] to draw a tomb against the pool at you
[1:23:44] it's time to let go and get it get real
[1:23:47] it's time to give give over to that
[1:23:50] desperation because brother Branham
[1:23:52] taught us that when when you begin to
[1:23:54] get desperate that's when things happen
[1:23:56] something begins to take place when you
[1:23:58] when you begin to get desperate you know
[1:24:00] I'm not your brother Bob was talking
[1:24:01] about getting the new birth no I'm
[1:24:03] talking about this whole journey when
[1:24:05] you begin to see the Statue of a perfect
[1:24:07] man and you realize that there's
[1:24:08] something like it in your life something
[1:24:10] more beyond is something greater than
[1:24:12] just a new birth then I believe it
[1:24:15] should create a desperation and you if
[1:24:17] that's really God calling you and that's
[1:24:19] really God drawing you and not just
[1:24:21] somebody drawing it out on the
[1:24:23] whiteboard
[1:24:23] not just somebody explaining it to you
[1:24:25] so you say well good I've got that now
[1:24:27] from an intellectual standpoint I've got
[1:24:30] a good laid out for me but when God does
[1:24:32] the draw and when God begins to reveal
[1:24:34] himself for you it puts you into
[1:24:36] desperation why because you're desperate
[1:24:39] for the word brother Burroughs said in
[1:24:43] desperation she said you can't be
[1:24:45] desperate til God speaks to you Oh
[1:24:48] Church rise and shake yourself pits your
[1:24:52] conscience wake yourself up in this hour
[1:24:55] we must be desperate or perish
[1:24:58] there is coming forth something from the
[1:25:00] Lord I know it as thus saith the Lord
[1:25:03] there is coming forth something and we
[1:25:06] better get desperate
[1:25:07] that's between life and death it'll pass
[1:25:09] through us and we won't see it you know
[1:25:12] I believe maybe sometimes it kind of
[1:25:14] hinders people when when ministers get
[1:25:16] to preaching about desperation it kind
[1:25:18] of oh well don't you think I'm desperate
[1:25:20] enough for whatever don't you think
[1:25:22] maybe you don't see the way that I pray
[1:25:24] and agonize that many times we don't but
[1:25:26] I believe many times preachers are like
[1:25:28] Joshua and Caleb when they begin to
[1:25:29] stand up there as they saw the people
[1:25:32] unwilling to make a stand and what do
[1:25:34] they do they begin to wring their
[1:25:36] clothes and I believe that's what the
[1:25:38] Ministry of the gospel around the
[1:25:39] message is doing in this hour is that
[1:25:41] written in their clothes and desperation
[1:25:43] it's time to get desperate it's time to
[1:25:46] pay take a body change do you think
[1:25:48] you'll take a body change without
[1:25:49] getting desperate do you think you'll
[1:25:51] take your body change with just going
[1:25:53] along haphazardly like brother Lewis was
[1:25:55] preaching this morning
[1:25:56] yeah listen listen that was a
[1:25:58] masterpiece this morning that he
[1:25:59] preached because he was talking about
[1:26:01] the lackadaisical layout of seeing
[1:26:03] spirit that grabs a hold of so many and
[1:26:05] you just go floating away down the river
[1:26:07] floating away without getting desperate
[1:26:09] but I believe that gospel was sin in
[1:26:11] this day to make you desperate to
[1:26:13] realize that something's gotta take
[1:26:15] place you gotta be like that little
[1:26:17] chicken hatching out at the edge like a
[1:26:19] little ego I had will say eagle brother
[1:26:21] Bret told the story about the little
[1:26:22] chick hatching the other egg but I'm
[1:26:23] gonna say Eagle Eagle hatching out of
[1:26:26] the egg then it's it's desperate to
[1:26:28] break through it's desperate to get
[1:26:30] through that thing and he said that
[1:26:32] little that little Eagle and a little
[1:26:34] chicken whatever it is it's labeled and
[1:26:37] it's pushing trying to get through and
[1:26:40] you know what you can't help it you
[1:26:42] can't help it because it'll kill it what
[1:26:44] is it what does he mean by you can't
[1:26:46] help it you can't do it for it you can't
[1:26:49] do it for your kids you can lay it in
[1:26:52] front of them you can lay the gospel in
[1:26:54] front of them just like the ministering
[1:26:56] of the Gospels laying it in front of the
[1:26:58] people but I can't make anybody live the
[1:27:00] gospel like you've heard the story
[1:27:02] that's saying about you can put lead a
[1:27:04] horse to water but you can't make him
[1:27:06] drink you can lay the gospel in front of
[1:27:08] somebody but it's only God that can draw
[1:27:10] them to it
[1:27:11] it's only
[1:27:12] god that can draw them to make it to
[1:27:13] drink and listen your God is drawing you
[1:27:17] through a process and you're laboring to
[1:27:19] bring forth life laboring
[1:27:21] like remember the story of Hana shall
[1:27:23] she began to cry she didn't have a son
[1:27:25] she wanted to see that promised son come
[1:27:28] forth he wanted to see a child come
[1:27:31] forth and she began to call out for God
[1:27:33] when they went when her husband went
[1:27:35] down to do his beauty as a priest she
[1:27:37] went into the temple and lay there
[1:27:39] before the altar and she forget to call
[1:27:41] out to God why because there was
[1:27:43] something that she knew she didn't have
[1:27:45] and she needed and I believe that's how
[1:27:48] every every young person every old
[1:27:50] person in this in the entire world and
[1:27:52] that in this church today should be you
[1:27:55] should realize if there's something that
[1:27:56] you don't have call out to God until God
[1:28:00] comes upon the scene and delivers that
[1:28:02] son into you everybody all right brother
[1:28:13] ever said in birth pains he said Lily he
[1:28:16] said considering how it grows toils has
[1:28:19] to bring herself up this little pond
[1:28:21] Lily where it where it come through dirt
[1:28:23] look mud muddy waters dirty waters it
[1:28:26] pressed its way through all of that this
[1:28:28] little germ of life working itself from
[1:28:30] the bottom of the pond where the frogs
[1:28:32] and things are at and then brings
[1:28:33] yourself up through all of that but when
[1:28:36] it gets in the presence of the Sun it's
[1:28:38] born the little seed bursts open into
[1:28:41] life it cannot do that until it goes
[1:28:43] through all that process it's got to
[1:28:46] come through there that's what makes it
[1:28:48] is because the discern itself is what's
[1:28:51] drawing the Sun itself
[1:28:53] it's what's drawing the life in that
[1:28:56] seed and when it gets fully above all
[1:28:59] the dirty waters and muck and so forth
[1:29:01] then it's so happy
[1:29:02] it just gives its life out freely and
[1:29:05] it's a beautiful life when it gets to
[1:29:07] the presence in the presence of that
[1:29:09] which is drawing it up I think that's a
[1:29:11] beautiful type of Christian life with
[1:29:14] something that's drawing you out of the
[1:29:15] world until one day you're born right
[1:29:18] into its presence by the Holy Spirit how
[1:29:21] beautiful if you try to help it you kill
[1:29:24] it
[1:29:25] like a little chicken when it's being
[1:29:26] born you know if you'd ever noticed one
[1:29:28] of the little fellers ride on top of his
[1:29:30] little beak already bird that's born
[1:29:32] from an egg it's got its maturing this
[1:29:34] Oh egg shell the old inner parts of the
[1:29:36] eggs has to rot away and it has to take
[1:29:39] this little beak and scrape back and
[1:29:42] forth until it breaks to shell out
[1:29:43] we call it peeping its way out down in
[1:29:45] Kentucky where I come from
[1:29:47] peeping his way out they have never
[1:29:49] found a better way see you try to help
[1:29:52] him you'll kill him pick the shell off
[1:29:55] of him he'll die see he's got to labor
[1:29:59] strain break forth you see that's what's
[1:30:04] happening in the church now is that the
[1:30:06] church is laboring breaking forth
[1:30:08] laboring to bring forth the promised son
[1:30:11] and many many in this church are at
[1:30:13] different stages of labor some are
[1:30:16] laboring to just push through that
[1:30:17] through that little that first was a
[1:30:19] layer of dirt into the Sun and some are
[1:30:22] laboring to push forth and bring forth
[1:30:24] that adopted son that adopted child that
[1:30:28] birth of the Son of Man different ones
[1:30:30] at different stages of labor but we're
[1:30:32] all laboring but I want to encourage you
[1:30:34] tonight I see that's what makes it so
[1:30:36] difficult to preach I can't make anybody
[1:30:39] desperate but yet I'm gonna be I'm gonna
[1:30:41] preach desperation you must be desperate
[1:30:44] you must be desperate in this hour now
[1:30:47] is the hour of desperation I see I'm so
[1:30:50] tired of hearing excuses well we can't
[1:30:52] get desperate into your persecution
[1:30:54] combs I believe that if you get along
[1:30:56] with God a little bit if you'll get into
[1:30:58] the world and begin to just look into
[1:30:59] the mirror of God's Word long enough
[1:31:01] it'll create a desperate longing in you
[1:31:03] to see God's Word fulfilled in you I
[1:31:06] believe that I believe that that's what
[1:31:08] that's what the message of the hour
[1:31:10] calls for desperate if and if not why
[1:31:13] did brother Branham preach desperation
[1:31:15] why did he preach birth pains I believe
[1:31:18] that it calls for something else other
[1:31:19] than just kind of coming along coasting
[1:31:21] alone coming to church just kind of
[1:31:23] being lackadaisical and that's why
[1:31:25] that's why in the book of Revelation it
[1:31:27] says he'll spew out of his mouth if
[1:31:29] you're neither hot nor cold just kind of
[1:31:31] lukewarm just lukewarm enough to just
[1:31:34] well I kinda I'm here I'm kind of doing
[1:31:37] it
[1:31:38] I know about the message so I must
[1:31:40] believe it but get into the message
[1:31:42] until it becomes a living reality to you
[1:31:46] listen I'm telling about my personal I
[1:31:49] told you about how when I when the Lord
[1:31:51] began to first call me when the Lord
[1:31:53] gave me the Holy Ghost when the Lord
[1:31:55] hath filled me with the power I remember
[1:31:57] the first thing that I thought well when
[1:31:59] I got I was reminded of how brother
[1:32:01] Graham said very very few will go all
[1:32:04] the way to receiving the new birth very
[1:32:08] very few and you think well that that
[1:32:10] means very few will go all the way to
[1:32:13] receiving it in that moment listen
[1:32:15] friends I hate to sound negative but I
[1:32:18] believe I believe that things are
[1:32:20] proving out that very very few have gone
[1:32:22] on to receive a real born-again
[1:32:25] experience not just talking about
[1:32:27] adoption but just the baby form born
[1:32:29] again experience and so I want to
[1:32:31] encourage you I want to lay it out
[1:32:33] before you it's time to get desperate
[1:32:35] let's so let's be on fire for revelation
[1:32:38] let's be on fire to see the promised son
[1:32:41] be born in us maybe the musician can go
[1:32:44] and come and I'm gonna try to wine it up
[1:32:46] right there because look we talked about
[1:32:51] making a stand making a stand you need
[1:32:54] to do this listen to this kind of music
[1:32:55] don't listen to that kind of music do
[1:32:57] they dress this kind of way take a stand
[1:32:59] for the gospel this is the way that you
[1:33:01] should be doing but you can't do that
[1:33:02] until God calls you otherwise it's just
[1:33:05] delaying what obeying a set of rules
[1:33:07] obeying a set of rules that your mom and
[1:33:09] daddy have set for you obeying a set of
[1:33:11] rules that your your pastor or whoever
[1:33:13] has set for you
[1:33:14] but when God comes down and begins to
[1:33:16] speak to your heart then it becomes a
[1:33:18] living reality it becomes something that
[1:33:21] God moving on the inside and he gives
[1:33:23] you he gives you something to stand with
[1:33:26] but until you get that Ephesians 4:13
[1:33:30] says wherefore take unto you the whole
[1:33:31] armour of God that you may believe all
[1:33:34] day and having done all to stand see you
[1:33:38] do everything that you can to stand you
[1:33:41] do everything that you can do to stand
[1:33:42] you do all that you can understand and
[1:33:45] then God will take care of the rest
[1:33:47] amen you believe that tonight let's
[1:33:52] stand on our feet and just and I just
[1:33:54] worship them for a little bit go ahead
[1:33:58] brother

[1:34:08] windows of heaven are open name and they
