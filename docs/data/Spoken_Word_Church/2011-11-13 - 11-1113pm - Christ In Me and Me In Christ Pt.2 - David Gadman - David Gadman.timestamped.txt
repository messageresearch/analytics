[21:09] hallelujah amen amen
[21:22] uh
[21:30] while you're standing we'll just uh
[21:32] read you another story
[21:34] this is kind of you might have heard
[21:36] this one before somebody said one time
[21:37] brother might have not mentioned this
[21:39] but
[21:41] called the last supper really the reason
[21:43] i'm reading this is you know you never
[21:45] know what you're going to end up or
[21:46] where you're going to be you say well i
[21:48] if i ever you know i don't have to serve
[21:49] god whatever but you don't ever know
[21:51] where you wind up you don't serve him
[21:53] hey man listen to this i thought this
[21:55] was amazing this is a replica of
[21:57] leonardo da vinci's painting of the last
[22:00] supper
[22:01] this famous masterpiece took over seven
[22:03] years to paint
[22:05] the interesting story behind the paint
[22:07] is that da vinci
[22:09] felt that he should use living persons
[22:11] as models since this was to be such an
[22:12] important picture
[22:14] he started with the painting of christ
[22:17] hundreds of young men were studied to
[22:19] find a man whose face portrayed
[22:20] innocence and beauty after long search
[22:23] he found a man whom he felt could
[22:24] portray christ the painting of christ
[22:27] took six months
[22:28] when christ was completed the vince he
[22:30] worked for six years painting the
[22:32] disciples until all were completed but
[22:34] one
[22:36] that one was judas
[22:37] to find someone whom they eventually
[22:39] thought looked like judas was a problem
[22:42] after a long discouraging search da
[22:43] vinci heard of a man in prison at rome
[22:45] who was sentenced to die for his brutal
[22:47] crimes
[22:48] leonardo went to rome
[22:50] as the prisoner was brought before him
[22:52] he saw a man with an ugly vicious face
[22:54] scarred and full of hate
[22:56] he knew immediately that this was the
[22:58] man he wanted to represent judas the
[23:00] savior's betrayer by special permission
[23:03] from the king the prisoner was brought
[23:05] to milo to pose for davinci for six
[23:07] months
[23:08] he set for davinci and appointed ours
[23:11] each day
[23:12] finally the gifted artist finishes
[23:15] his painting
[23:17] as the guards was taking the prisoner
[23:19] away he broke loose
[23:21] rushing to leonardo's leonardo's side he
[23:24] gaps look at me do you not know who i am
[23:28] with his sharp piercing eyes the bench
[23:30] he looked at the man and said no i do
[23:31] not know you i never saw you until you
[23:33] were brought before me in rome then the
[23:35] prisoner lifted up his head toward
[23:37] heaven and cried oh god
[23:39] have i fallen so low
[23:41] then he turned to da vinci said leonardo
[23:43] da vinci look at me again i'm the same
[23:45] man you painted only seven years ago as
[23:47] a figure of christ
[23:49] so i just thought that's real amazing
[23:52] you never know what you wind up amen if
[23:55] you ever get away from the lord and i
[23:56] sure don't want to get away from them in
[23:58] this late hour
[23:59] amen saint john's gospel the 10th
[24:02] chapter we want to look at this again
[24:06] excuse me christ in me and me in christ
[24:12] trust that everyone
[24:14] good afternoon and just
[24:16] can you pray for brother wade from sam
[24:21] services back home they ain't started
[24:22] yet but praying that they'll have a good
[24:24] time in the lord tonight
[24:27] john chapter 10 verse 21 let's just
[24:30] start at verse 25 again jesus answered
[24:32] them i told you and you believe me not
[24:36] the words that i do in my father's name
[24:38] they bear witness of me
[24:39] but you believe me not
[24:41] be because you are not of my sheep
[24:44] that's the reason they didn't believe
[24:45] him because they were known of his
[24:47] as i said unto you
[24:49] my sheep hear my voice
[24:51] and i know them and they follow me
[24:53] and i gave unto them eternal life and
[24:55] they shall never perish
[24:57] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[24:59] my hand
[25:00] my father which gave them me
[25:03] is greater than all and no man is able
[25:05] to pluck them out of my father's hand i
[25:08] and my father are one that's just by our
[25:10] heads
[25:12] father we love you lord this afternoon

[25:24] endeavor to try to say something that
[25:26] would bless your people lord open the
[25:28] eyes of our heart once again lord god
[25:31] help us lord
[25:32] may the vessel just move aside father
[25:34] you speak tonight lord because that's
[25:36] what we come for we didn't come from
[25:38] here to to hear or be seen from anybody
[25:41] lord not even me lord god i'm just the
[25:43] vessel that you chose to use to like
[25:45] father i pray that i can move myself
[25:47] aside lord and heal myself to you and
[25:50] you just use my lips and speak to me
[25:51] lord god and anoint the hearts and ears
[25:54] of the listener that they'll be able to
[25:56] listen and receive what they have need
[25:58] of father for me being a man i know have
[26:00] no way of knowing what they have need of
[26:02] father but father
[26:04] you do lord and lord if they pull from
[26:07] the gift lord lord you can actually move
[26:09] me away from my notes and speak directly

[26:19] fill all with the holy ghost we ask
[26:21] these things in jesus name amen you may
[26:24] be seated
[26:27] read that again out of the amplified
[26:29] verse 27 and 28 and that's what i want
[26:31] to kind of deal with them a couple of uh
[26:33] uh
[26:34] scriptures there tonight
[26:36] again christ in me and me in christ amen
[26:39] i want to be in him like we said this
[26:40] morning we found out that they they did
[26:42] not believe because they were none of
[26:44] his and i sure want to be one of his
[26:47] tonight amen
[26:49] and amplified the 27th verse it reads
[26:51] like this the sheep that are my own
[26:54] hear
[26:55] and are listening to my voice hey amen i
[26:58] hope i'm one of his tonight if i'm one
[26:59] of his i'm i'm hearing and i'm listening
[27:02] to his his voice amen and i know them
[27:05] and they follow me verse 28 says like
[27:08] this and i give them eternal life and
[27:10] they shall never lose it or perish
[27:12] throughout the ages to all eternity they
[27:15] shall never by any means be destroyed
[27:18] and no one is able to snatch them out of
[27:21] my hand thank god for that now let me
[27:23] read you something that the prophet of
[27:25] god said and then we'll get right into
[27:26] this amen got a few scriptures i want to
[27:29] look at some quotes and just different
[27:31] things and so you just bear with me
[27:32] tonight this is what the prophet said it
[27:34] isn't because my mother there is saved
[27:36] that i'm saved
[27:38] it's because god chose me in christ amen
[27:41] that'll make a shout right there it
[27:44] isn't because my mama's safe tonight it
[27:46] isn't because my daddy's saved it isn't
[27:48] because i go to brother homer's church
[27:50] or or i knew the prophet i fished with
[27:53] him i hunted with him it isn't bad but
[27:55] it's because god chose me in christ
[27:57] hallelujah hey amen it isn't none of
[28:00] them but it's because he chose me in him
[28:02] amen he said i want you to see it now
[28:05] you too not you choosing yourself amen
[28:08] not me choosing myself right amen it
[28:10] wasn't that but it's not your choice

[28:18] had nothing to do with it amen oh he
[28:21] said you had nothing to do with it god
[28:23] oh my when you get to see what's true
[28:25] you say you mean that i didn't turn to
[28:27] the lord no sir you had no way at all of
[28:30] turning to the lord your whole nature
[28:32] your whole makeup was against god amen
[28:35] my whole makeup my whole nature amen
[28:38] because me and you was actually born
[28:41] between satan and eve our nature we came
[28:43] to hear and the bible says we were born
[28:45] shaking iniquity come to the world
[28:47] speaking lies the first light we ever
[28:49] told was probably to get out of a
[28:51] whippet or something but hey our nature
[28:53] amen wasn't even for god amen but god
[28:56] knew that hey somewhere amen that he had
[28:59] like that little eagle story that the
[29:01] prophet of god talked about amen he said
[29:03] you had no way at all i turned to the
[29:05] lord your whole nature your whole makeup
[29:07] was against god god called you

[29:12] that he called me that he called you we
[29:14] are to be thankful to god for that
[29:16] tonight right right amen it always it's
[29:19] always been that way
[29:21] amen we're to be faithful to god tonight
[29:24] because of that amen we all stop right
[29:26] there and get on our faces before god
[29:28] say god i thank you tonight that you
[29:30] call me that i didn't have nothing to do
[29:33] with it nobody had but god you called me
[29:35] and you chose me and you
[29:37] right
[29:38] hallelujah amen it's just as a shepherd
[29:42] he protects his sheep jesus protects his
[29:45] people from harm amen we can expect as
[29:47] believers to suffer on earth meaning we
[29:50] can expect as believers we're going to
[29:52] suffer amen we're not exempt from those
[29:54] things amen satan can't harm their souls
[29:57] are taking away their eternal life with
[29:59] god amen
[30:01] he can't do that it's like job amen you
[30:04] know he has to play satan has to play by
[30:06] the rules of the game right
[30:08] amen amen you know the story there how
[30:11] that when he came the sons of men the
[30:13] sons of god came to brazil there and
[30:14] satan was right amongst them and god
[30:16] asked him to have you uh consider my
[30:18] servant job how did he say just man he's
[30:21] he he hates evil and he's a perfect man
[30:24] and there's none like him
[30:27] amen can you man i hope he says that
[30:29] about me tonight but there's none like
[30:31] him amen amen and open satan said well
[30:33] you got a head bit around let me just he
[30:35] said all right but don't take his life
[30:37] amen and all that the bible says that
[30:39] job never did charge god foolishly hey
[30:42] amen i mean you're not exempt from those
[30:45] things amen but i hope that mean you
[30:47] amen can have something like joe did
[30:50] that though all hell is raging against
[30:52] us amen we're going through hell in high
[30:54] water but we are still able to stand
[30:57] because it's christ in me and me in
[30:59] christ right amen amen oh we may have to
[31:03] suffer we may have to go on to all kinds
[31:05] i don't understand them things sometimes
[31:07] hey but we will have to we're not exempt
[31:09] amen he said there are many reasons to
[31:11] be afraid
[31:13] amen because this is the devil's
[31:17] hey man hey i get kind of scared every
[31:20] now and then hey man i get kind of
[31:22] afraid every now and then hey man when
[31:24] you look around you see that but cause
[31:26] this hey this is the devil's domain amen

[39:10] instant
[39:11] it no longer draws its support from its
[39:14] environment life ceases
[39:17] at that point the organism is declared

[46:15] that what about now amen god help me
[46:18] that's where i come to the house the
[46:20] bible that's why a lot of people don't
[46:21] want to come to the house of god because
[46:23] the scripture says judgment begins at
[46:25] the house of god and a lot of people
[46:27] don't want to come because i know if
[46:28] they come they're going to be judged

[46:54] short at right amen
[46:57] check up on our soul salvation
[47:00] take inventory hey man we need to do it
[47:03] every day all right
[47:05] every second of the day yes he said all
[47:07] of us we're short of what christ wants
[47:09] us to be that's right oh god
[47:12] help me then lord if i'm short of what
[47:14] you want me to be god help me lord help
[47:17] me to line up help me to take your word
[47:19] and embrace it lord oh god he said it's
[47:22] time to lay aside every weight
[47:25] amen
[47:26] he said even when death knocked it amen
[47:29] that's saint paul's heart door hey man
[47:32] he was he said what in this car he said
[47:34] i'm persuaded hey man i know whom i
[47:36] believe amen what do you say he said i
[47:38] fought a good fight and i kept the faith
[47:39] but then hey amen here's where they laid
[47:41] it for me to crown the glory amen not
[47:44] only me but those who are looking for
[47:47] his coming hallelujah he was persuaded
[47:51] amen he said if he sent you and you're
[47:52] sure of it you're going to achieve this
[47:55] the work that god he said if he sent you
[47:57] and you're sure of it you're you're
[47:59] going to achieve the work that god
[48:01] predestinated you to do you'll stand
[48:03] there and god and god will take every
[48:07] carnal impersonation away from you amen
[48:09] right stand there you can be you you can
[48:13] be persistent because you know who you
[48:15] have believed and what's right examine
[48:17] your revelation with the word if it's
[48:19] contrary leave it alone if it's with the
[48:21] word god's bound duty bound to keep his
[48:24] word amen his duty bound to keep his
[48:27] word so amen i want to check my
[48:29] revelation and if it's a mind up with a
[48:31] word that needs duty bound to help me
[48:34] and see me through
[48:36] hallelujah
[48:37] hallelujah
[48:39] amen
[48:41] glory god
[48:42] amen
[48:44] hallelujah look at john
[48:47] hey man like i said i'm just i'm just
[48:50] reading these and i can see you can
[48:52] look at them take a note on the reading
[48:54] when you get home hey man saint john 8
[48:57] amen and uh
[48:59] 12. hey man it says it like this saint
[49:01] john 8 12
[49:02] it says then speak jesus again unto them
[49:05] saying i'm the light of the world he
[49:07] that followed me shall not walk in
[49:09] darkness but shall have the light of
[49:10] life
[49:11] hallelujah and again in saint matthew's
[49:14] gospel the 7th chapter in the 14th verse
[49:17] because straight is the gate and there
[49:19] is a way and amen which leads to them to
[49:22] lie and few there be that find it
[49:24] who am i now listen to what the prophet
[49:26] said he said that manifested out of the
[49:28] world amen is the bible jesus said he
[49:31] was the light of the world the bible
[49:32] said he is the word the vindicated
[49:35] scripture is the light
[49:37] amen so if we got the light in us then
[49:40] we're the vindicated scripture for this
[49:42] hour that we're living in all right
[49:43] listen he said see how perfectly the
[49:45] scripture is a day that won't be called
[49:47] day or night amen fruit can't rob it
[49:49] unless the sun ripens it no matter how
[49:52] how
[49:53] matter how much you preach whatever you
[49:56] do it can't be robin it can't be
[49:58] manifested it can't be vindicated only
[50:00] by him who said i am the light of the
[50:02] world the word the word so there has to
[50:06] come forth the power the holy spirit
[50:08] himself to robin are to vindicate our to
[50:12] our to prove or to make manifest that
[50:15] what he's predicted would happen in this
[50:18] day
[50:19] hallelujah
[50:21] hallelujah they eat their light predicts
[50:24] that or produces that hey amen so the
[50:27] light it's come and then it produced
[50:30] what it said it would produce it'll
[50:31] indicate what it said it would have been
[50:33] okay it'll manifest what it said it
[50:35] would be manifested
[50:37] right amen then we read in matthew 7 14
[50:39] because straight as a gay this isn't
[50:41] what he said but you he said because
[50:43] straight as the gate narrows away and
[50:45] but few there will be that find it for
[50:47] as it was in the days of noah we're in
[50:49] eight souls we're saved so shall it be
[50:51] at the covenant of the son of man think
[50:52] of it what day are we living
[50:54] do you recognize the eye
[50:56] do you recognize today
[50:59] oh my god right he said do you recognize
[51:01] the eye right he recognizes today
[51:03] brother says we're living the light out
[51:05] right this is not few of them in
[51:08] in his day recognized him
[51:11] even knew him just very few
[51:14] never recognized him never knew him
[51:17] millions of people that knew nothing
[51:19] about it
[51:20] he said millions
[51:22] of people that never knew nothing about
[51:24] it
[51:25] he said
[51:28] street is a gate and there's the way
[51:30] just thinking of how many didn't
[51:32] recognize him didn't know he was that
[51:35] and then right around where he was at
[51:38] that's the pitiful part but they didn't
[51:40] recognize him what about today
[51:43] but they don't recognize the hour and
[51:46] the day they're living in
[51:48] amen when they see things come when they
[51:50] see the word of god being made manifest
[51:52] they still don't recognize amen they are
[51:55] and the day that they're living in god
[51:57] help me they meant to recognize my day
[52:00] and my heart that's why i want to be i
[52:02] want to re that's why i need to remain
[52:04] open to his will and say god help me
[52:07] oh my he said he'd give us eternal life
[52:09] he said he'd do that he said my sheep
[52:11] know my voice he said a stranger they
[52:12] won't follow he says they know my voice
[52:14] they're mine i'll keep them their
[52:15] fathers put them in my hand and no man
[52:17] can pluck them out amen oh saint john 1
[52:20] 12 says it like this but as many as
[52:22] received him to them gave he power to
[52:25] become the sons of god even to them that
[52:27] believed on his thing see he came to his
[52:29] own the scripture says and his own
[52:30] received him not but as too many as
[52:32] received him to them gave he to who then
[52:35] that received him that he the power gave
[52:38] them the power to become the sons of god
[52:41] amen
[52:42] when he came he was expressed
[52:45] just exactly like the scripture said he
[52:47] wouldn't be expressed when all those who
[52:49] were redeemable believed it
[52:51] amen all those that were redeemable
[52:54] believed it
[52:55] amen because he said to them

[53:03] and the only ones that could receive him
[53:05] were those that were redeemable right oh
[53:07] my
[53:08] so he came and expressed just like the
[53:10] scripture says he would express amen
[53:12] then all those who were redeemable
[53:14] believed it because they were the
[53:15] thoughts of god
[53:17] the attributes of him at the beginning
[53:19] were made flesh and redeemable as
[53:22] brought back to god as many amen because

[1:10:53] hey amen he said oh that does it amen
[1:10:56] he's gave me the shield of the holy

[1:11:04] hallelujah
[1:11:05] amen oh i'm sure glad that god knows all
[1:11:09] about us
[1:11:10] one more listen what he says
[1:11:13] now where are we today brethren
[1:11:15] where are we at if you abide in me and
[1:11:18] my words in you then you can ask what
[1:11:20] you will right and it'll be done for you
[1:11:23] now that's christ's own word the word
[1:11:26] has to abide in you that's right if you
[1:11:28] abide in me in christ and my word in you
[1:11:31] then how did we get into christ by
[1:11:32] baptism of the holy spirit then that's
[1:11:34] one part but then if you abide in me and
[1:11:37] then my words abide in you then you can
[1:11:39] ask what you will but you have to have
[1:11:41] both christ and the word and you're you
[1:11:44] really can't have one without the other
[1:11:46] that's right because it's the self same
[1:11:48] thing you can't have the father without
[1:11:49] having the son you can't have the son
[1:11:51] without having the holy ghost it's a
[1:11:53] self-same spirit so then see you can't
[1:11:55] you can't do it any other way then today
[1:11:57] god's provided absolutely for our lives
[1:11:59] now i'm tied to him by his word he's my
[1:12:02] absolute i found that it's a great and
[1:12:04] precious to live by him
[1:12:08] christ in me and me in christ
[1:12:11] amen he said i found out that it's
[1:12:14] precious to live by him
[1:12:16] hey man that's what i want to live by
[1:12:18] tonight hey man i don't want to live by
[1:12:20] nothing else but i want to live by him
[1:12:22] and i want him to be in me and me and
[1:12:24] him all right oh that's what i'm
[1:12:26] searching today
[1:12:27] hey man that's why i'm taking inventory

[1:14:02] but anyway they built it
[1:14:04] and they labeled the ship the unsinkable
[1:14:06] right
[1:14:08] they even had lifeboats on that ship
[1:14:11] but why have lifeboats if it's
[1:14:13] unsinkable right
[1:14:15] hey man could you imagine what a whole
[1:14:17] lot of faith so it's like saying i got a
[1:14:19] watch that can never lose time
[1:14:22] i got a car that can never get a wreck
[1:14:25] hey man i remember them getting on the
[1:14:27] getting on the uh uh oh no as they built
[1:14:29] it and they said uh uh uh operator
[1:14:31] rawlings operator back then i forget how
[1:14:33] many years she had to work in order to
[1:14:35] buy one ticket to go on its maiden
[1:14:36] voyage to riding first class
[1:14:39] one person got in there said they sucked
[1:14:41] to their knees in the carpet
[1:14:43] one lady got on there by the name of mrs
[1:14:45] cordova
[1:14:47] she had 72 trunks that was just for her
[1:14:49] clothes oh my god the rich
[1:14:52] and the luxurious is the ones that got
[1:14:54] on there he meant to take its maiden
[1:14:57] voyage
[1:14:58] and as she was getting on there she
[1:15:00] looked it to one of the dead cans and
[1:15:02] she said do you think this thing is
[1:15:03] really unsinkable and he looked at her
[1:15:05] and said ma'am god almighty can't sink
[1:15:07] this oh my god
[1:15:09] oh god
[1:15:10] can you imagine that's like what
[1:15:11] happened i think i forget what it was
[1:15:13] when a new york had a blackout 1960 or
[1:15:16] something and they said hey we'll fix it
[1:15:19] they said we fix it so we will never
[1:15:20] have another one
[1:15:22] 1977 they had another black house three
[1:15:25] separate boat of lightnings hit three
[1:15:26] separate power plants at the same time
[1:15:29] oh my god
[1:15:31] you don't mess with god that's right but
[1:15:32] anyways getting over i'm saying this
[1:15:34] because hey we're on this ride amen and
[1:15:36] america is going down i want to be in
[1:15:37] christ hey man she's sinking hey man
[1:15:40] there's nothing stopping her she's going
[1:15:41] down hey man i don't care hey man you
[1:15:44] can put a washington you can put a link
[1:15:45] in every county in the world she's going
[1:15:47] down but listen here's the story here
[1:15:50] that it was and they was getting on
[1:15:51] there and they was going and and they
[1:15:53] was taught they was good warnings i
[1:15:55] think seven warnings about icebergs
[1:15:58] that night seven warnings we've been
[1:15:59] through seven church ages oh man i had
[1:16:02] seven warnings
[1:16:03] the last warning ain't many cops sold
[1:16:05] out on there to where the operator took
[1:16:07] off his earphones and threw him down
[1:16:09] said shut up shut up we don't want to
[1:16:11] listen to the warnings anymore
[1:16:14] but they hit that iceberg
[1:16:16] right amen
[1:16:18] they knocked the first class
[1:16:20] plumb on their beds
[1:16:22] well one day i got hit by the word hey
[1:16:25] man see the up the second class they
[1:16:27] didn't feel it too much the third class
[1:16:29] didn't feel nothing at all but it was
[1:16:30] the common people that heard him gladly
[1:16:33] hallelujah one day i heard the word amen
[1:16:35] and it knocked me out of my bed
[1:16:37] hallelujah hey man oh there's a lot of
[1:16:39] people about to hurt it but it didn't do
[1:16:41] no good amen
[1:16:43] amen amen there's make believers there's
[1:16:45] uh uh uh unbelievers but hold up
[1:16:47] believer when he hears it he'll make his
[1:16:49] way amen i don't care come hell or
[1:16:51] eyewater he'll make his way to give his
[1:16:53] life to the lord amen and so there was
[1:16:56] good and so when they hit it it just so
[1:16:57] happens that the desire of the ship was
[1:17:00] aboard the titanic he went down there
[1:17:02] and he said he said if one compartment
[1:17:04] because of compartments we're filling up
[1:17:06] with water he said if one compartment
[1:17:08] was spilling up said you might we might
[1:17:10] could still float if two maybe
[1:17:13] but he said all sick i think it's six or
[1:17:15] seven is that all seven compartments are
[1:17:17] filling up since she's going down
[1:17:20] you better sound the warning but he
[1:17:21] hesitated
[1:17:23] and he hesitated
[1:17:24] the one at the end
[1:17:26] they had to held off the men
[1:17:29] from the lifeboats with guns he said
[1:17:30] nobody's getting on the lifeboats but
[1:17:32] the women and the children
[1:17:35] and in the end when it started listening
[1:17:37] and it was going down
[1:17:39] all the band there was a bright bunch of
[1:17:41] men they were playing with ragtime music
[1:17:43] to kind of keep the people calm but at
[1:17:45] the end they said you can hear them off
[1:17:46] in the distance playing near my goddamn
[1:17:49] that's right
