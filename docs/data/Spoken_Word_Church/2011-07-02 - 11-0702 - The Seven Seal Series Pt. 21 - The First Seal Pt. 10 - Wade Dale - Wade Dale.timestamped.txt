[0:32] read a little bit today now what we're
[0:34] going to do is good to have sister
[0:36] Francine re with it from Jamaica and her
[0:40] husband speaking for us today did a
[0:42] wonderful job last night looking forward

[0:48] Fellowship
[0:50] afterwards all right Revelation 6 CH 1
[0:54] now what we've done is we have this is
[0:55] number 10 I think in the first seal but
[0:58] it's number 20 as far as as being um in
[1:01] the seven seal series We are
[1:05] continuing on the first seal we're going
[1:07] to read this today we're going to read
[1:08] some quotes and then next Sunday what
[1:11] we'll do is we'll put everything all the
[1:13] identifications of the first seal we'll
[1:15] list it then we're going to go to the
[1:17] second seal so the second seal will be
[1:19] in two Sundays all right but this coming
[1:22] Sunday will be a recap and then we'll
[1:26] put down all it like it's the the U
[1:29] combat Beast is the lion uh we're
[1:31] looking at the Antichrist the Deeds of
[1:34] the
[1:34] nicians uh mystery of iniquity man of
[1:37] sin we've already read all
[1:39] that and then we'll move on to the
[1:41] second seal all right so at this pace we
[1:45] will probably be finished about
[1:47] Christmas but if we're still here that's
[1:50] okay if we're not that's okay too we'll
[1:51] just finish it over there we don't have
[1:53] to go and uh depart from each other so
[1:56] chapter
[1:58] 6 verse one
[2:01] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[2:03] the seals and I heard it were the noise
[2:04] of Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[2:08] come and see and I saw and behold a
[2:10] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[2:12] bow and a crown was given unto him and
[2:16] he went forth
[2:17] conquering and to conquer now remember
[2:21] what we were talking about for the past
[2:23] Sundays the White Horse is the white
[2:24] righteous Church it had to be white
[2:27] because it had to be deceptive it
[2:28] couldn't be he couldn't start off as a
[2:31] black horse because you could see the
[2:32] separation had to start off with the
[2:34] White Horse Satan had to start out so
[2:36] close remember we read in Ezekiel we
[2:39] read in Isaiah we read in 2
[2:41] Thessalonians that man of sin he wanted
[2:44] as as he was cast out as he was cast out
[2:47] of Heaven he's always wanted to get back
[2:50] into heaven well what is heaven Heaven's
[2:53] not a space or somewhere that's for wall
[2:56] Heaven brother Brown said consist of the
[2:58] word so he got kicked out out of the
[3:01] word Satan got kicked out of the word
[3:03] cuz that's what he's perverting he's
[3:04] perverting the
[3:06] word when he got Adam and Eve to do what
[3:09] they did that perverted this outside guy
[3:11] but God still kept Adam and Eve their
[3:15] soul was clean they they had the baptism
[3:19] of the Holy Ghost in their soul
[3:21] right but they did what they did with
[3:24] the outer man so the outer man
[3:26] fell Adam never fell in in his soul
[3:30] right that theophany never that's right
[3:33] that's why I don't understand these
[3:34] people trying to say well you're just a
[3:37] soul brother R spent all his whole
[3:40] Ministry trying to make sure that we
[3:42] understood that we had a body a spirit
[3:44] and a soul we live in three different
[3:46] room
[3:49] right we're not just a soul we're a body
[3:53] spirit and
[3:54] soul a man all right and this man Christ
[3:59] Jesus showed us how to live in all
[4:02] three but Satan took Adam's ability to
[4:06] be Eternal in this thing you're seeing
[4:08] right here not the soul right because
[4:11] the soul that sinth it shall die not the
[4:15] spirit we sin every day of our life
[4:17] that's right all right even bad thought
[4:19] even you know Dad and I were talking
[4:21] about even even if let's just be plain
[4:25] we're adults the relationship you have
[4:26] with your wife that's
[4:28] sin
[4:30] God allowed that to happen he allowed
[4:33] the bed not to be defiled but if we have
[4:36] any kind of thought that we're not going
[4:38] to have those thoughts over there right
[4:40] we're not going to have those thoughts
[4:41] over there not going to need those
[4:44] thoughts over there it's going to be
[4:46] brother R said it's going to be so much
[4:48] higher wow so much higher than what we
[4:51] love down here it's going to be he said
[4:53] millions times what we love you okay so
[4:56] we sin every day we have sinful f
[4:59] thoughts but that soul and that person
[5:02] that you are that being that come to you
[5:04] at the new birth that person never had a
[5:06] bad thought that person never sinned cuz
[5:09] the seed remaineth in it and it cannot
[5:11] sin all right but as Christians we have
[5:14] sins and we sin every day all right but
[5:18] what we got to realize is that now that
[5:22] that we have I think the the apostles
[5:24] had a great understanding of the soul of
[5:28] man watch Paul's writings and all those
[5:30] and then Peter going up the statue of a
[5:32] perfect man he understood that this man
[5:34] inside was perfect but this man outside
[5:37] was not so this man outside had to be
[5:40] brought under subjection to the one
[5:42] inside all right so there's where you
[5:45] come to where they could not take a body
[5:46] change because they said okay my soul is
[5:50] eternal they believe that held on with
[5:54] with good faith but they died this end
[5:57] time that's not what's going to happen
[5:59] somebody's going to take this this part
[6:02] of the Bible and let it become a brand
[6:04] new book why not become a brand new book
[6:06] cuz you know what as a as a born again
[6:08] Christian I read the Bible and boy it
[6:10] just opened up things to me and opened
[6:12] up things to me but now it's opened up
[6:14] more things to me all right I mean it
[6:17] become a brand new book like I said it
[6:19] didn't become a brand new chapter that's
[6:20] right it become a whole brand new book
[6:23] why because
[6:25] you
[6:26] you brother Brandon preached doors IND
[6:28] doors
[6:30] read that book sometime doors and doors
[6:32] he said even though you are a Christian
[6:34] once God's in your house you allow him
[6:36] to come in remember the door knobs on
[6:38] the inside and you let him in that's
[6:39] right you let him in you become a
[6:41] Christian you become born again he said
[6:43] there's still doors in your house that's
[6:46] right that you don't let God in that's
[6:49] right and he start talking about listen
[6:53] Pride all kind of things that you got
[6:55] that as a Christian what it's that right
[6:57] there you got you got uh to to me you've
[6:59] got seven
[7:01] doors Butz this is the door you let him
[7:03] in at Faith all right this is the door
[7:06] you let him in and this does have
[7:09] something to do with the
[7:10] first but we got to understand one thing
[7:13] we either are God or we're the devil
[7:16] right one of the two and you can be
[7:19] white righteous every day of your life
[7:20] and die and go to hell you can ride that
[7:22] horse right there and he'll take you
[7:24] right into purgatory you open the door
[7:26] to let God in but see you still got
[7:28] doors in'll shut
[7:30] everybody understand that you got doors
[7:32] that you have to
[7:34] open you say seven ads there's seven ads
[7:37] this is not an ad he said add to your
[7:39] faith 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven all right then
[7:44] it's all molded together by the holy
[7:47] spirit that comes and puts all this in
[7:51] action remember you're put insert you're
[7:53] put at a position for service then
[7:56] you're put in service you're put in
[7:58] service that's you birth but then you
[8:00] put in service for virtue you put in
[8:02] service for knowledge for temperance
[8:03] patience Godly kindness all right and
[8:06] the Capstone which is love not the love
[8:08] you have for your wife it's a love
[8:09] that's greater far greater than that cuz
[8:11] remember the Bible said in 2
[8:13] Thessalonians it wasn't that they didn't
[8:15] hear the
[8:16] truth they didn't hear the love of the
[8:19] truth now remember we read that it
[8:21] wasn't it says the love of the truth is
[8:23] what they turn
[8:25] down they had the truth
[8:28] right people in a message church for
[8:30] years have the truth but do they have
[8:32] the love of the truth love AG love
[8:34] what the love of God the perfect love
[8:36] that brother R said all those people
[8:37] over on the other side had perfect love
[8:39] which was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[8:41] in your soul the new birth because
[8:45] people if we don't see that that man is
[8:46] in
[8:48] there you're not going to see that
[8:50] opposition going any other direction
[8:52] that's right when that white horse rider
[8:54] rode out away from brother brandham and
[8:56] he saw that Rider go away from him he
[8:59] knew one thing for
[9:00] sure he might come back as something
[9:03] else but that white horse was riding
[9:06] away from him he said here stands the
[9:07] Lamb with a book in hand and there goes
[9:08] the white horse rider the what that
[9:11] white righteous
[9:13] church that he might have been a part of
[9:15] cuz he was preaching that the Holy Ghost
[9:17] was the was the white horse rider which
[9:19] was wrong he corrected himself God
[9:21] corrected the prophet we can't correct
[9:23] it all right but you saw that opposition
[9:26] right off you and I must see the same
[9:28] thing
[9:29] you and I must see that same writer that
[9:32] white righteous like brother Keith was
[9:34] talking
[9:35] about this is not a social event I don't
[9:38] come in here Sunday just for a social
[9:40] event to see
[9:41] y'all I come to meet God and if God's in
[9:44] you then I meet you God in you just try
[9:48] I'm s
[9:50] that's when it says that Satan was
[9:52] kicked out of heaven and Heaven consists
[9:54] of the word was he was he take taken
[9:58] from the revelation of the word that's
[10:00] why he's trying exactly trying to get
[10:02] back in he was taken away he was the
[10:04] anointed sherff he was the guy he was
[10:06] the uh vice president in other words
[10:09] right but when God said remember what we
[10:11] read it he said when iniquity was found
[10:13] in you I cast you out in other words
[10:16] that's paraphrasing that's what
[10:17] scripture said when we read in
[10:19] Ezekiel thou son of the morning you've
[10:21] done this you've done that you walked
[10:23] through the Garden of Eden pretty close
[10:25] to God you had God you had Adam who was
[10:29] what secondary God Eve who was a
[10:33] secondary god with
[10:34] Adam then you had the
[10:37] devil you had four pretty powerful
[10:39] people walking in the Garden of
[10:41] Eden now what happened see Adam got
[10:44] messed up Eve got messed up and the
[10:45] whole thing got messed up now what's and
[10:48] then what did God say he said depart in
[10:50] other words go away but I'll come and
[10:52] make this thing come back what to the
[10:55] original to where there wasn't where
[10:57] where you can you you can have love for
[10:59] your for your sister and it not be a
[11:01] love that's perverted like it is down
[11:03] here that's right you know with Godly
[11:06] love but it says I saw and behold a
[11:09] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[11:10] bow remember he was a
[11:12] bluff and a crown was given unto him who
[11:14] gave him the crown you and I gave him
[11:17] the crown or the people in the church
[11:19] ages that that believe these ideas
[11:21] that's why brother randam said he said
[11:23] he said I he said I always wondered
[11:24] about those denominations well he
[11:26] preached why am I against organized
[11:27] religion in 1959
[11:30] 4 years before the seals broke and now
[11:33] he's just realizing why no he had a
[11:36] further revelation of wine he knew it
[11:38] was rotten but he really didn't what he
[11:41] was trying to do was put it in the word
[11:43] right but when he put it in the word in
[11:45] that first seal and he saw that white
[11:47] righteous Church stand so close and
[11:49] remember we talked about John John on
[11:52] the aisle of pmas he
[11:55] admired the Bible said he admired that
[11:57] church he looked upon her in other words
[12:00] she was so
[12:02] beautiful he was getting so close to it
[12:06] right he was getting close even a born
[12:09] again Christian for 60 years this man
[12:12] admired that church because it was so
[12:14] beautiful now he didn't see a big steep
[12:15] he saw the spirit that was working in
[12:17] that church all right wasn't the big
[12:21] Steeples and the colors and the pantry
[12:23] and all the gold no he saw that but he
[12:25] admired her it said what her
[12:29] the
[12:31] system and guess what you and I can
[12:33] admire it and that's what we do until
[12:35] we're born
[12:36] again we're just a
[12:38] church we're just an
[12:41] organization then when we come into the
[12:42] body of Christ we become an
[12:44] organism all right
[12:48] now when power was given in the first
[12:51] church age second Church age Third
[12:53] Church age like I said a couple of
[12:55] Sundays ago it's kind of strange that
[12:56] that third age parallel with the seals
[12:59] the first three ages and that third age
[13:02] ended in 606 which was the Nan Council
[13:07] all right which they began in 606 to
[13:11] declare that Jesus was not the substance
[13:14] of God but a light substance so he was
[13:16] another person another personality and
[13:18] there's where your Trinity of the
[13:20] godhead came about there at n brother
[13:23] Brown calls it the Deeds of the
[13:26] nickan cuz they conquered the Ley with
[13:28] the Deeds that they started with
[13:30] remember the Bible say it was a saying
[13:33] from a saying it become a Doctrine and
[13:34] all the way up let's read that let's
[13:36] take the seal
[13:38] book page 143 in this book R
[13:45] paragraph
[13:52] 292 everybody okay
[13:57] there paragraph
[14:00] 2992 first seal got it should be around
[14:04] on top of your page if you got a seal
[14:06] book like this one right on top
[14:08] paragraph
[14:09] 292 got
[14:12] it
[14:13] okay who is this mysterious riter of the
[14:16] first church age then who is he let's
[14:17] think of it who is this mysterious riter
[14:19] that starts forth in the first age and
[14:21] rides Plum on out into eternity cuz
[14:23] remember like I said Satan got off of
[14:26] that horse but the horse just kept on go
[14:29] it cuz the people gave it the power when
[14:31] when he became a pope and they became
[14:35] remember a crown was given brother Bram
[14:37] said you can't Crown a spirit so it
[14:38] started right there and in in Paul's age
[14:40] he said Grievious wolves remember we
[14:42] read would come in among you and he even
[14:45] gets to far to say hey some of you
[14:46] inside of this
[14:48] group is going to lead some of the
[14:50] people away all
[14:54] right and rides Plum out into eternity
[14:56] so he gets off one horse
[14:59] that horse already has his
[15:02] characteristic and he just keeps on
[15:04] riding cuz what he's riding right on in
[15:06] the people that father son Holy Ghost
[15:08] baptism um the Trinity all that came
[15:12] about of this white righteous church
[15:14] this white righteous animal horse the
[15:18] power horse is the power the power what
[15:21] the people gave the horse the power
[15:23] Satan just gets off of that horse he's
[15:24] already he's already got those people
[15:27] duped or are um deceived so he gets on
[15:32] another horse we're going to see that
[15:33] again that he'll get on the second horse
[15:36] cuz he had something else to do remember
[15:38] I said before God never changes his way
[15:41] God never changes his tactic but Satan
[15:43] always Chang his head he'll get on a
[15:46] white horse and he oh well they're going
[15:48] to know what's going on so I'm going to
[15:49] go jump over here or I can't get you
[15:51] this way I'll get you another way
[15:52] remember brother said he said Satan's
[15:54] got one shot right wherever your
[15:56] weakness is he's got one shot am right
[15:59] and when he's and and he's and he said
[16:01] he had a right for that one
[16:03] shot but when he makes that shot you
[16:05] better make sure you got it covered cuz
[16:07] he's coming for it whatever weakness you
[16:10] got he's going to try you all right now
[16:14] let's go down to paragraph
[16:16] 294 a white horse rider went out see who
[16:20] is he he is mighty in his conquering
[16:22] power he is a great fellow in his
[16:24] conquering power you want me to tell you
[16:26] who he is he's the Antichrist exactly
[16:29] what he is now because you see if if if
[16:32] an antichrist Jesus said that two would
[16:34] be so close together until it would
[16:35] deceive the very the bride if it was
[16:38] possible Antichrist it's the Antichrist
[16:41] Spirit hadn't been crowned yet
[16:43] Antichrist Spirit but we see in the
[16:46] first seal it said a crown was
[16:48] given so there had to be some flesh come
[16:51] on this guy or whoever this person is
[16:53] all right remember in the church ages
[16:55] when we opened the first church age back
[16:57] there we found out that the holy Spirit
[16:59] was against a certain thing that got
[17:00] started in that church age and that was
[17:02] called the Deeds of the
[17:05] nicians you remember congregation says
[17:07] amen niiko means conquer Ley means the
[17:10] church the Ley niik lean to conquer the
[17:13] Le take the Holy Spirit out of the
[17:15] church and give it all to one holy man
[17:18] let him be the boss of all of it you
[17:21] went through it see nickan notice nickan
[17:24] was a
[17:26] saying come out of saying Paul age
[17:29] Grievous wolves is going to come a Sayan
[17:32] CU see there was no Trinity back in the
[17:33] first three Church ages but they began
[17:36] to talk about it speak about it Satan
[17:40] got in the congregation and started
[17:42] putting a seed in people's
[17:44] mind you know this Jesus
[17:47] guy how could he be
[17:50] God he said he was the son of God that
[17:54] makes him a lower form a son so there
[17:56] must be a father son then there must be
[17:59] a father son Holy Ghost then there must
[18:01] be a woman involved because you got to
[18:02] have a woman to have a birth so let's
[18:04] bring Mary into this thing see how easy
[18:07] it is I can just sit here and try I can
[18:09] make it so pretty I can almost make you
[18:10] believe it sitting right here then it
[18:13] just looks so strange that you'd have
[18:16] God come down in a son and and be a baby
[18:18] and be born of a virgin and and like
[18:21] brother Rand said he said uh a natural
[18:24] birth is more complicated than a than
[18:26] the the Virgin birth cuz it was God
[18:29] creating but like the people in the
[18:31] message they say God created the egg and
[18:33] a germ and then it just grew up a man
[18:34] and then he become God at the River
[18:36] Jordan well you know what you're right
[18:37] back to NAA
[18:39] again you're right back to that old
[18:41] doctrine that there's three
[18:44] Gods cuz if they say there's even just
[18:46] two Gods that's right the two Lord
[18:48] Doctrine and all that stuff he's not two
[18:51] that's right remember I told you in the
[18:53] Bible y'all looked it up for me it says
[18:55] the Holy One of Israel o n e One right I
[18:58] will not see let my holy number two see
[19:01] corruption that's what most people say I
[19:04] I'll not let my holy number two see
[19:06] corruption no it says my Holy One see
[19:09] corruption all
[19:10] right but you see how easy though you
[19:13] can come in here and you with
[19:14] flattery with flattery you can start
[19:17] that's right you could start digging
[19:19] just a little bit and I can do it I'm a
[19:22] minister I can do it I can twist your
[19:23] mind I mean you may the Holy Spirit may
[19:25] catch it sometimes the Holy Spirit may
[19:27] not catch it
[19:29] but the Holy Spirit somewhere is going
[19:31] to catch it if you got the real holy
[19:32] ghost in your soul something's going to
[19:34] sitting in many times in a
[19:36] service um and something just say that's
[19:41] not right that's right something's not
[19:43] right that's right that's not right and
[19:45] you feel it right inside that's right
[19:47] and and it's worse when about 300 other
[19:49] people are shouting and praising God
[19:50] over the over the error and you're
[19:52] sitting there going this ain't
[19:55] right but people shout over anything
[19:58] that's that's how it got started in the
[19:59] first age same thing that same Spirit
[20:00] listen people that Spirit never died
[20:02] that's right Spirits don't
[20:04] die Spirits over in Jamaica don't die
[20:08] they Same Spirit over here like Keith
[20:09] said just to color the Skin's a little
[20:11] bit different same devil all right same
[20:15] action same
[20:20] tactics you think if you went on an
[20:22] island by yourself you wouldn't have any
[20:25] any false Doctrine but if it's more than
[20:27] one you've got two IDE
[20:32] not that you heard that story about the
[20:34] guy that uh they found him on an island
[20:37] and he was all by himself there was two
[20:39] buildings there and he said guy come to
[20:42] get him you know been about 5 years I
[20:44] come to get him said what is that he
[20:45] said well that's the church that I go
[20:49] to only one guy on the whole island you
[20:51] know that's the church I go to now and
[20:53] the man said well what's this building
[20:54] over here he said well that's the church
[20:56] I used to go to
[21:06] funny but it's
[21:08] not funny but it's
[21:10] not all right take the Holy Spirit out
[21:13] of the church and give it all to one
[21:14] holy man let him be the boss of all of
[21:16] it you went through it see nickan notice
[21:19] nician was a saying in one Church it
[21:22] became a Doctrine in the next Church age
[21:25] still can't Crown a Doctrine but when
[21:27] you come up to that third age and in the
[21:29] Third Church age it was a forcement and
[21:31] they had deny see a counsel and it was
[21:33] then made a Doctrine go down to 297 to
[21:36] save
[21:37] time look he started out to conquer
[21:40] notice he has no Crown the white horse
[21:41] rider I'm speaking of here a bow and the
[21:43] crown was given him
[21:47] afterward who give it to him the
[21:50] people that's why you must hear the true
[21:52] word of God to combat this that's right
[21:55] to combat this horse
[21:58] Rider but he's a bluff he has a word
[22:02] with no
[22:03] power okay he has no Crown see he had no
[22:07] Crown to start with but a crown was
[22:09] given him notice later he was given a
[22:12] crown yeah three of them three on one
[22:15] that was 300 years later at the naasan
[22:20] council when he started out a spirit of
[22:23] nickan to form an organization among the
[22:26] people and then it kept on going going
[22:29] on became a saying and then it
[22:31] became a
[22:33] Doctrine now look at save time
[22:37] 301 when n nican see the Antichrist is
[22:41] finally he is carnate in a man then he's
[22:45] crowned when he started off as a nickan
[22:47] spirit in the church he's a spirit you
[22:49] can't Crown a spirit but 300 years later
[22:52] he became a pope and what's he talking
[22:54] about he's talking about the first Nan
[22:56] counsil was 300 a day the second I
[22:59] counsel when they put this thing into a
[23:01] law and a Doctrine was 606 so it was 300
[23:03] years later all right put 300
[23:06] years Satan's Satan's got patience
[23:09] Satan's got more patience than you got
[23:10] to that you perfect man that's right
[23:13] okay so don't think he's no he's patient
[23:16] right he just comes in with flattery the
[23:18] Bible say just a little bit here and a
[23:19] little bit there see if you come in with
[23:23] with with with that dark horse at
[23:26] first youd know yeah you come in with
[23:29] that black horse you say opposition but
[23:32] he came in with a white horse just like
[23:35] Jesus riding a white horse in the
[23:36] Millennium he pulled that out of God's
[23:38] mind he pull that out of the Bible in
[23:40] other words the
[23:42] Bible don't you think Satan saw all that
[23:44] stuff he saw it what did remember when
[23:47] Jesus came on Earth the brother read it
[23:49] the other Sunday Satan took him on a
[23:52] mountain and showed him what the world
[23:56] every nation right brother BR said show
[23:59] him United States so it wasn't just then
[24:01] over there in Palestine he showed him
[24:03] forward to right now all right so guess
[24:08] what Satan's got a little bit of
[24:10] forethought yes the only problem is he's
[24:12] an unbeliever yes he don't believe this
[24:14] is going to happen to him he don't
[24:15] believe that somebody's going to break
[24:17] his bond and knock him off his
[24:20] horse okay cuz he's had so much success
[24:24] this is the whole thing about this seal
[24:26] book this seal open
[24:28] Satan has had so much success even after
[24:30] the seals were open in 1963 people kept
[24:33] dying the prophet died so Satan's like
[24:37] there's nothing to this all there's got
[24:39] to be a people stand up and say this is
[24:42] what's going to happen this it's going
[24:44] to happen to me right death toward your
[24:47] Ste grave toward your Victory just like
[24:48] I said here in our our our theme is in
[24:51] my flesh I shall see God that's good
[24:53] that's good for job to say that cuz he's
[24:55] dead but see in my flesh I shall see God
[24:58] without dying that's right without dying
[25:01] in my flesh but this right here this s
[25:04] I'm not talking about this book you
[25:06] understand the revelation of these seals
[25:08] somebody's going to pick it up and
[25:09] somebody's going to carry it on and
[25:11] somebody is going to take those four
[25:14] horses and Destroy them cuz they're
[25:17] they're all death brother R when we get
[25:19] in that fourth seal he'll say it was
[25:21] death from the beginning but we're just
[25:23] now able to name it see it was death to
[25:27] begin with this white righteous Church
[25:30] what that killed
[25:31] people brother brandham said 68 million
[25:35] Jews I mean 68 million Protestants were
[25:38] killed he said Untold billion
[25:41] spiritually killed that's the worst to
[25:43] kill 68 million Christians you just put
[25:45] them in heaven but when you kill 68
[25:48] million people that are not Christians
[25:50] you put them in hell you've done worse
[25:52] to them if you if you had physically
[25:55] killed them than to spiritually kill
[25:57] them and let them just keep on going
[25:58] thinking that they are
[26:00] right what's the mystery of iniquity
[26:03] iniquity is knowing to do something and
[26:05] you do it anyway that's worse than not
[26:08] knowing what you're doing we come up to
[26:10] the end time and things we know not to
[26:12] do we do them anyway that's right see
[26:14] that's where we got to get rid of that
[26:15] thing all right let's finish reading
[26:17] right here get up front so s Fran can
[26:19] sing
[26:24] for but now look in paragraph 302 he's
[26:28] talking about the pope and all that but
[26:29] now look Glory notice and when this holy
[26:33] spirit that we
[26:35] have now let's talk about the opposition
[26:38] this holy spirit that we have becomes
[26:41] incarnate to us the one that's in our
[26:43] midst now in the form of the Holy Ghost
[26:45] becomes incarnate to us in the person of
[26:48] Jesus Christ will crown him King of
[26:50] Kings now where are we going to crown
[26:51] him
[26:52] here we in our flesh are going to Crown
[26:55] in King of Kings here
[26:58] cuz if he's not King over this it's
[26:59] going to
[27:01] die when he resurrected all power in
[27:03] heaven and earth been given unto me why
[27:05] he had rulership over everything he
[27:07] didn't have rulership over his body he
[27:09] said well wait a minute he had to
[27:11] sleep he had to eat he had to function
[27:14] as a human being remember he was tired
[27:17] went to sleep in a boat remember he got
[27:20] aggravated with a group of people one
[27:22] time and planted a
[27:24] rope see but when he come out of that
[27:27] grave he said all power all all power
[27:29] brother BR said if he another God he
[27:31] don't have a lick of power if we believe
[27:32] what Jesus said we believe what Jesus
[27:35] said there's no other God that's got any
[27:37] power
[27:38] anywhere but see that's that's not the
[27:41] second person of the Trinity saying
[27:43] that that's almighty God saying cuz all
[27:46] power in Heaven and Earth has been given
[27:47] unto me like brother Brown said if
[27:49] there's another God somewhere he's
[27:50] powerless that's right so when when he
[27:53] gains
[27:54] preeminence here that's when he's prown
[27:57] that's when Crown now we'll let you know
[28:00] how we going to Crown I I was telling
[28:01] somebody the other day when we talk
[28:03] about
[28:05] crowns Crown we think is Look up the
[28:07] word
[28:08] Crown it's
[28:10] glory it's
[28:13] honor most
[28:15] crowns are um trying to think of the
[28:20] word but it it's it's more like leaves
[28:23] oh yeah Ivy um you've seen them before
[28:25] maybe in your country that season that's
[28:29] correct because when we crown him King
[28:31] of Kings I don't think we're literally
[28:32] going to go up there and put we're not
[28:34] going to all be wearing a crown I just
[28:35] want think that it's going to be the
[28:36] crowning
[28:38] Glory all right we give him total
[28:41] preeminence in our life we crown him
[28:44] that's right see we then we if we
[28:46] literally put a crown on his head that's
[28:48] fine with
[28:49] me but when we're crowned and cap with
[28:51] that Capstone we're not going to walk
[28:53] around and I'm not trying to be
[28:54] sacrilegious or funny but when we're
[28:55] crowned with a Capstone we're not going
[28:57] to walk around with a pyramid hat on top
[28:58] of our head I mean I'm not trying that's
[29:01] not none at all but I'm trying to make a
[29:02] pointal crown for us to know who he is
[29:05] right no that's right
[29:07] no no he when he come out of that grave
[29:10] he was
[29:11] crowned king of Lord case King but see
[29:14] he's still Satan's got a little
[29:16] preeminence sorry guys Satan's got a
[29:19] little bit in all of us we got bad
[29:21] thoughts and all these these got a
[29:22] little but I'm going to tell you
[29:23] something I'm going to make this
[29:25] plain brother brand said this thing
[29:28] right here is going to be sticky till
[29:29] the day we are changed this thing right
[29:32] here because it came from your natural
[29:35] parents and you're going to fight it
[29:37] till the day you're changed and and
[29:39] dad's trying his best to show us a
[29:41] simple way to not know how the change is
[29:46] going to happen but understand that
[29:50] we're in the right time we've got the
[29:52] right word we're we're in the right
[29:54] position that's right to walk into a
[29:56] change brother said what a change just a
[29:59] change just
[30:02] change just a
[30:04] change Abraham and Sarah I don't believe
[30:07] his hair started getting darker one day
[30:09] and dark no I believe he was changed the
[30:12] Bible said we'll be changed in a moment
[30:13] in the twinkling of an eye I believe
[30:16] Sarah and Abraham just woke up one
[30:17] morning and he looked over at her and he
[30:19] thought he got in the bed with the wrong
[30:22] woman and she looked over and looked at
[30:25] him and said I'm definitely in the bed
[30:27] with the wrong
[30:28] man no they looked at each other and
[30:30] they knew because see they' lived
[30:32] together since they were children you
[30:35] know 16 17 years old they lived together
[30:37] so they knew each other as they were
[30:38] young so they looked over at each other
[30:40] and I I believe it kind of sparked in
[30:42] Abraham's mind he said Now's the Time
[30:46] right he met
[30:49] MDC and fed him and and and MDC said one
[30:54] thing that's very important he said can
[30:56] I withhold
[30:58] anything from
[31:00] Abraham can I withhold anything see
[31:02] that's the end time right now we may
[31:05] meet MDC which we should have in our new
[31:07] birth we and we shouldn't meet MDC why
[31:09] because he's a
[31:10] priest he's a preacher he's a priest
[31:13] he's a high
[31:15] priest if we meet
[31:17] him that's what he's saying to you if he
[31:20] communes with you like Keith said last
[31:22] night there's certain times that that
[31:24] that you have to just sit down and and
[31:27] work it out with you and God alone
[31:29] that's right there no man can do it for
[31:30] you no man can have an answer if
[31:32] somebody was to come talk to me about
[31:33] losing their
[31:34] wife I couldn't talk to them I couldn't
[31:38] do that now brother Gary Atkins could
[31:40] and some of the others did their wives
[31:42] were pass on you see I couldn't enter
[31:44] into that right but it would take
[31:47] another brother or it would take you
[31:48] just sitting down with God and just say
[31:50] God I ain't nobody I can talk to but you
[31:53] and God alone but still you got to have
[31:54] a high priest you got to have a priest
[31:57] and that's what Abraham recognized who
[31:59] he was right one God not three he said
[32:01] Lord one so we got to recognize one true
[32:04] Living God and then he said can I
[32:06] withhold anything from
[32:08] Abraham and that's what he's saying to
[32:10] you and I in the opening of the seals he
[32:12] said I now cannot withhold anything from
[32:15] you because you've come to a
[32:17] position then 30 days later they were
[32:21] changed cuz remember what did God say he
[32:23] said about what the time of life the
[32:26] other 28 days you know 30 days you women
[32:29] know what I'm talking about you cycle
[32:31] you going to be changed cuz you think
[32:33] you going to have a baby so from the
[32:35] time he m m cassid it was only a 30-day
[32:38] period but now remember during that
[32:41] 30-day period he gave his wife away
[32:44] again remember she'd done been changed
[32:47] she' done been changed at that there at
[32:49] the end and went down to guer
[32:51] remember and she was beautiful brother
[32:54] BR didn't Mar that old 100y old grandma
[32:57] he said that ought to prove as a change
[32:59] right there he said that King can have
[33:00] thousands of beautiful young women and
[33:02] here he wanted that one oh
[33:05] grandma no she'd already been changed
[33:07] back so during that time in
[33:10] there so that's what I'm telling you to
[33:13] make a point we're still going to have
[33:15] problems even heading toward the change
[33:17] of the body we're still going to have
[33:20] even though we're fixing to get ready to
[33:21] birth the promised son we still going to
[33:24] have problem and we got to watch
[33:26] ourselves amen okay because you still
[33:29] live in this thing right here Abraham
[33:31] still wanted to save what his stinking
[33:33] flesh the prophet said he didn't want to
[33:36] lose his life he wanted to save himself
[33:38] so he told a little
[33:40] lie but watch how God is God said hey
[33:44] a I'll not hear you until you get that
[33:48] man to pray for
[33:51] you that what because he had promised
[33:54] that man that man had to promise a
[33:57] didn't have the promise Abraham had the
[33:59] promise that's what I tell you about all
[34:00] the time all the time don't worry about
[34:04] the journey when Abraham come to the end
[34:07] he just walked right into that body
[34:10] chamber but now he was in the right
[34:12] place at the right time if he would have
[34:14] been off her and sheep somewhere and God
[34:16] walked by he'd have missed it but he was
[34:19] sitting in the right place he had his
[34:21] little wife with him they were doing the
[34:22] right then here come
[34:25] God
[34:28] I was just thinking always said God it
[34:31] to us a little bit at a time we can't
[34:33] take we couldn't take it that's correct
[34:35] and when when mes came to Abraham he had
[34:39] to be that had to be a long visy because
[34:41] they cooked that P well he butchered the
[34:44] cow he cooked it brother R said made
[34:46] buttermilk so it takes a little while to
[34:48] make buttermilk they had a long visit
[34:50] sure they were there for probably a day
[34:52] or so you know who knows because like I
[34:54] said you take a calf and you butcher it
[34:57] you you Slaughter it I know you know
[34:59] even deer hunting it takes a while to to
[35:01] skin one out and clean it out and then
[35:03] they cooked it then they make cakes so
[35:06] it was a visit that wasn't a 5minute
[35:09] visit Abraham didn't go create cakes no
[35:13] he was a human he had to bake them you
[35:14] know him and Sarah so it was a journey
[35:17] that they took but Abraham one thing
[35:19] when MDC got ready to leave remember
[35:23] what he said one more time can I
[35:26] withhold any
[35:27] anything from this man and brother
[35:30] brandham said we are a type of
[35:33] Abraham actually Abraham the type of us
[35:37] everything types the bride we don't type
[35:39] Abraham Abraham typed us Isaac typed us
[35:44] okay everything in this Bible types me
[35:46] and you we don't type people remember
[35:49] we're not a type we are the person that
[35:51] God looked for we are the image that he
[35:53] wanted we're not a type of the image
[35:55] that he wanted we're the image that he
[35:56] he wanted we're supposed to be God made
[36:00] manifest in another form Abraham
[36:02] couldn't do that cuz Abraham didn't have
[36:04] the new birth Abraham had an anointing
[36:06] he had a promise God honored that
[36:08] promise but Abraham was not
[36:12] bride you and I are bride we're Sons and
[36:14] Daughters of God Abraham cannot look at
[36:16] God and say God you're my father sure he
[36:18] can in the Old Testament terms of being
[36:20] Jehovah God that's right but his father
[36:22] far as being in the lineage of being a
[36:24] son he wasn't a son I don't see why
[36:26] people can't believe that cuz the Holy
[36:28] Ghost did not fail in in the Old
[36:30] Testament they had an anointing just
[36:31] like an anointed one that God would
[36:33] anoint that spirit and then he would
[36:35] lift off and then Abraham could do what
[36:36] he did give his wife away laugh at God
[36:39] do the things that he done David could
[36:41] do the things he
[36:42] done I I don't it's to me it's very
[36:45] simple brother R said if David had had a
[36:47] new birth he'd have never done what he
[36:48] done that's
[36:50] right right but he did it in his flesh
[36:55] right but God so loved David because so
[36:56] David had a heart that we got to
[36:59] remember God can see all things he he
[37:02] saw David's
[37:03] Integrity David loved God but he
[37:06] couldn't control what because that rider
[37:09] was riding in
[37:11] him huh Satan was right there come on
[37:14] people Satan's right there he's not far
[37:17] off he's right here with us he comes
[37:19] Church be than we do that's right he's
[37:21] here when we're not that's right right
[37:25] but now next Sunday we're going to we'll
[37:27] just list all the
[37:28] things and then we'll go start on the
[37:31] second seale but remember this thing is
[37:33] so close it could very deceive the very
[37:35] elect if it were
[37:38] possible but we know it's not
[37:41] possible
