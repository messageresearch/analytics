[2:29] father we thank you for this day in your
[2:31] love unto us we thank you for grace and
[2:33] Calvary thank you for salvation thank
[2:35] you for being you and we pray now that
[2:37] you would just bless us and come Among
[2:39] Us Lord to speak to us you've sung to us
[2:42] we sung to you and you've worshiped
[2:44] we've had a good time in doing that
[2:46] prayed and and all Lord and talking
[2:48] about you now it's time to sit down and
[2:51] listen to the word so we ask you to open
[2:53] our eyes that we may see truly who you
[2:56] are and what you're doing we love you
[2:58] and we thank you forgive our sins
[3:00] guide us in Jesus name
[3:03] amen
[3:04] Romans 8.
[3:12] and we know that all things work
[3:13] together for good to them that love God
[3:16] to them who are the called according to
[3:18] his purpose
[3:20] for doing whom he did for no he also did
[3:22] predestinate to be conformed to the
[3:25] image of his son that he might be the
[3:27] firstborn among many brethren
[3:29] moreover whom he did notice
[3:33] you're going you know I keep saying this
[3:36] where you'll remember it
[3:38] you're going to this moreover verse 30
[3:40] starts it's already done
[3:43] man all right see moreover whom he did
[3:47] predestinate that's done done
[3:50] he also called Already Done
[3:53] in whom he called them he also Justified
[3:55] already done in whom he justified them
[3:58] he also glorified
[4:00] it's all done in him now it's not done
[4:03] in me and you that's the difference in
[4:05] it but right all right said
[4:08] what's then what shall we then say to
[4:11] these things
[4:12] if God be for us who can be against us
[4:14] you may be seated Lord had his Blessing
[4:17] to the reading of the word
[4:20] that undropped it I'll pick it up in a
[4:22] minute and the message
[4:24] I generally try to get everything so
[4:26] perfectly in line and and
[4:29] one time I might goof and leave the
[4:31] script and I put down first Timothy 1 17
[4:33] but that's not the one I wanted all
[4:36] right I'll get to it in a minute it'll
[4:37] be in the message
[4:39] but now remember what we're trying to
[4:40] talk about
[4:42] how does God predestinate
[4:47] he predestinates by his foreknowledge
[4:50] because you've got to go
[4:53] to
[4:55] foreknowledge first
[4:58] then you go to predestination
[5:00] you don't go to predestination first
[5:02] because you're you're missing the point
[5:05] you're you're getting it that would be a
[5:07] predetermined Factor but by
[5:09] foreknowledge he can predestinate
[5:14] what will happen and do and can write it
[5:17] down
[5:18] to me the Bible was written before the
[5:19] world ever begun I don't have any
[5:21] trouble with that
[5:23] uh you know the whole Bible as far as
[5:25] God was concerned
[5:27] he was was done back there because he
[5:30] said infinite he's not like me and you
[5:32] that has to think things over and change
[5:34] your mind you know and do up and down
[5:36] what he once says is finished
[5:39] now that's what about having a mind like
[5:41] that
[5:43] but now
[5:45] you forgive me I try to explain
[5:47] something
[5:48] I believe
[5:51] that The Closer we're coming to the true
[5:54] understanding of God's word
[5:58] I believe we're coming to the mind of
[6:00] God
[6:03] you said well I was born with a mind of
[6:05] God that's true
[6:06] but we were born with babies babies mind
[6:10] of God
[6:11] that's the best way to say it because
[6:12] why would you need the statue of perfect
[6:14] man growth development if you were had
[6:17] everything to start with all right well
[6:19] see I believe that we're coming to a
[6:21] place now until we can talk about some
[6:23] of the things that we're speaking of
[6:26] in that way we can get a better
[6:28] understanding because we can we can tie
[6:31] together a lot the prophet has said and
[6:33] it won't be confusing and and then we
[6:36] will have a better understanding
[6:38] of God's word
[6:40] but now remember what this morning the
[6:43] one thing I want you to hold over to
[6:44] remember
[6:46] the prophet said if we
[6:49] don't stay with the same simple gospel
[6:52] said we will work our way away from the
[6:55] truth
[6:56] well now that's
[6:58] salvation one God word of baptism no
[7:01] eternal hell
[7:02] all of those things are the same simple
[7:04] Doctrine in other words what he taught
[7:06] up to that place
[7:08] he's talking during the seal book right
[7:12] see then we just want the great big
[7:14] things to look out and see what this is
[7:16] and that is
[7:17] no I want the Simplicity of the Gospel
[7:20] the word that I can walk upon what I
[7:23] believe
[7:24] you know and it'll hold me
[7:27] and like I've always said if the
[7:29] disciples had eternal life you know as
[7:31] everybody said well you come with
[7:33] eternal life whether the disciples had
[7:35] it why was they scared to death right
[7:37] right they scared to death in that Upper
[7:39] Room
[7:40] they weren't coming out of there until
[7:42] the Holy Ghost fell but when the Holy
[7:44] Ghost fail it was clear to nothing
[7:46] change the whole situation didn't it all
[7:48] right see that's the way we are when you
[7:50] know where you stand you don't have to
[7:51] worry about them right
[7:53] you're just going down the line
[7:54] believing it and don't worry about
[7:56] what's going
[7:57] but now we've tried to explain this
[7:59] morning about the
[8:02] fact of us being part of God
[8:07] and I know that's a
[8:09] it's a word that's been used the
[8:11] prophets words were there
[8:13] uh we talked about it
[8:15] but sometimes in the human element we
[8:18] have troubles
[8:19] comprehending very simple words
[8:22] part of God
[8:25] well see we want to we make that as
[8:27] being something he made
[8:30] right and talk about a part of
[8:34] I I have no thoughts whatsoever
[8:38] of talking about the children of God
[8:42] as being something that God made
[8:46] no I know maybe the wording is is
[8:50] different from maybe sometimes the way
[8:52] we hurt things and things but think
[8:54] about it just think
[8:59] if there is just
[9:01] God and he's eternal
[9:05] and that God has offspring
[9:09] children
[9:12] not only now all of us by natural
[9:14] creation are the children of God
[9:15] everybody in the world is a child of God
[9:18] by creation you understand that
[9:20] you know it don't matter who it is God
[9:21] had to give the life there's no way it
[9:24] doesn't matter uh what you do with all
[9:26] the other every person the prophet said
[9:29] that come into the world is a child of
[9:30] God
[9:31] why because God created us
[9:34] all right
[9:35] but now I'm back talking now about
[9:40] in eternity
[9:42] were that God dwelt Alone
[9:47] he was self-existing so then we couldn't
[9:50] be back there his people
[9:52] her ideas or thoughts we could only be
[9:54] there as an attribute that was in him
[9:59] as I said this morning then we talk
[10:01] about being there as in his mind well
[10:03] Judas was in his mind
[10:09] but see Judas proved who he was
[10:13] in what he done
[10:15] you know what we prove Who We Are
[10:20] we prove who we are what we do
[10:24] all right then in being that
[10:27] I'm talking about the children of God
[10:33] not children of God the way we talk
[10:34] about children of God
[10:37] we've talked about children of God that
[10:39] we become children of God
[10:42] you know
[10:43] well
[10:46] what are you talking about
[10:50] we received the new birth
[10:54] and it makes us a child of God
[10:58] but did we have a beginning
[11:00] does that eternal life that you received
[11:02] in your new birth did it ever have a
[11:04] beginning anywhere
[11:06] no
[11:09] it was a time we didn't have it
[11:12] right
[11:14] there is my whole key right the time we
[11:17] didn't have that
[11:19] and by the new birth it was transmitted
[11:22] to us
[11:24] and see that another way God
[11:29] he could dwell alone
[11:33] self-existing
[11:36] and yet he could have within him
[11:39] the attributes to be a savior A Healer a
[11:42] father a son
[11:45] and none of that in existence in any
[11:47] form other than within him
[11:53] is that hard to comprehend
[11:57] I know sometimes words we use and
[12:01] thoughts maybe that we hadn't thought of
[12:03] or are strange and we have to consider
[12:07] them a little while
[12:10] but see that's the way I believe God
[12:13] I believe Jesus was God made manifest
[12:16] according to the scriptures in flesh
[12:23] then being that God he's not a second
[12:25] person
[12:29] he's the person
[12:32] I looked that up one ago it's on Daniel
[12:34] 70 weeks paragraph 110 of the the part
[12:37] called six-fold purpose
[12:40] he's not as
[12:42] a second person or anything he's the
[12:44] person
[12:48] right and being that then God
[12:53] never had a time did he begin
[12:57] now the word God had a time that it
[12:59] began
[13:01] because it would be developed into being
[13:03] by worship
[13:05] God meaning an object of worship
[13:08] but it was the same Eternal God
[13:10] go back to the questions and answers in
[13:12] Genesis and listen to the prophet his
[13:15] explains
[13:16] he said the creation of the world a
[13:19] different thing he said like a child
[13:21] playing before the father's nowhere
[13:25] and said then he says let there be
[13:28] what
[13:30] who was speaking
[13:33] was that a son
[13:36] was that another person
[13:38] or was that God in another form
[13:41] called a son
[13:44] a lot of difference in it right
[13:47] see then Jesus Christ dwelling on the
[13:49] Earth
[13:50] was God in another form
[13:54] now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ is God in
[13:59] another form amen
[14:01] called a bride that to me is simple
[14:06] sure I admit there was a time that was
[14:08] very very confusing
[14:11] but yet
[14:13] you just keep thinking about it
[14:17] as he was the Bible says so are we
[14:20] in this world
[14:22] so here he was in mortal flesh
[14:26] Soul and Spirit almighty God flesh being
[14:29] a creation
[14:31] at a beginning
[14:34] that flesh had to be made Eternal in the
[14:37] resurrection
[14:39] all right
[14:40] you and I
[14:42] lost doomed and on the way to hell
[14:46] amen God came down by the new birth
[14:49] which I firmly believe in justification
[14:51] sanctification of baptism of the Holy
[14:53] Ghost
[14:55] not just walk up the altar shake the
[14:57] preacher's hand and say I believe the
[14:58] message
[15:01] don't do that with me I might tell you
[15:02] the devil does it too
[15:04] I'm sorry I might just do that because I
[15:07] don't want to hinder your faith
[15:09] but I don't want you just based on some
[15:12] thought of your mind
[15:17] see I believe you buy the new birth have
[15:21] eternal life
[15:23] and if that's true
[15:26] if that's true that you have eternal
[15:28] life
[15:29] then that eternal life
[15:31] never had a beginning
[15:33] so it always was eternal
[15:36] so the prophet's right when he says
[15:38] you always was eternal he's right
[15:42] but he's not talking about this body
[15:46] we have no sense to look at that know it
[15:48] right
[15:50] um
[15:52] see he's speaking in the terms of
[15:55] understanding
[15:58] the truth of the word of God
[16:02] and see then
[16:03] by doing that see he's he's bringing it
[16:06] down to showing us who we are
[16:10] he says we're little Messiahs
[16:14] he says we're little gods
[16:21] you know we are as the scripture says
[16:24] that the word comes to the
[16:27] sons of God
[16:31] we know how it comes right we're not no
[16:34] problem
[16:35] the word come by the way of the prophet
[16:39] as I said the other day you say well you
[16:42] don't you mean it can't come to me I
[16:44] agree with you can't come to you
[16:46] can't come to me he came to the prophet
[16:50] all right
[16:52] we want everybody now trying to correct
[16:54] him yeah
[16:56] see because they think the words come
[16:58] into them
[17:00] we'll get to it in a minute where
[17:02] brother random mentions the Catholics
[17:04] and he says
[17:06] talk about eternal sonship he said and
[17:08] the other churches
[17:13] we know the Catholics are the one that
[17:14] believes in eternal sonship
[17:22] the Baptist Doctrine is eternal sonship
[17:26] co-equal co-eternal
[17:30] right
[17:31] God the Father God the son God the Holy
[17:34] Ghost and no scripture whatsoever for it
[17:36] that's right
[17:38] he said and the other churches
[17:41] all right let me say it like this you
[17:43] know the Catholics and the other
[17:45] churches like Lula
[17:50] they believe in eternal sonship
[17:53] blessed God I don't believe in it well I
[17:55] want you to explain it then
[17:58] because the only explanations I've ever
[18:01] heard of explaining Eternal sonship is
[18:03] always dealt with
[18:05] Jesus Christ
[18:07] I've never heard anybody in this message
[18:09] if you have I'm sorry and you know you
[18:11] tell me later but I've never heard
[18:13] anybody explain
[18:15] Eternal sonship in relation to the
[18:17] church
[18:18] have you
[18:21] I'm talking about in relation to us as a
[18:23] church
[18:24] we see then that's making us a second
[18:27] person
[18:30] and we we fight the quote of a lot of
[18:32] people that I'm a son of Jesus that was
[18:34] the son of God
[18:36] we say that was wrong
[18:39] you know and I agree
[18:43] but if you don't believe who you are
[18:47] then how are you going to have it
[18:48] straight
[18:53] we won't get to this because we're going
[18:55] to go over so far and then drop back and
[18:56] go back down so hang on to it
[19:01] the prophet of God said you never became
[19:04] a son of God
[19:06] by the new birth
[19:14] just believe that
[19:17] he said it's not the person
[19:20] that comes predestinated eternally from
[19:22] God
[19:24] or the but it's the word or seed
[19:29] a lot of things brother random said see
[19:31] that we need to get them together
[19:35] and and think about it
[19:38] and and it's not just saying that
[19:40] brother Dale's a teacher no I'm just
[19:43] what I am
[19:46] but you see these brothers out running
[19:48] on the field and they're not going to
[19:50] tell you everything brother Brown and
[19:51] said they're just going to quote what
[19:53] you want to hear yeah
[19:54] yeah and what they want to use
[19:56] and what makes you feel good
[19:59] oh you always was eternal
[20:02] you always wasn't I've got the quotes
[20:04] for the prophet well amen
[20:09] but if you always was eternal how did
[20:11] you become Eternal all right
[20:15] got a question
[20:17] how did you become eternal
[20:20] well you don't hear him preaching about
[20:22] the new birth
[20:26] they're preaching it's just a doing away
[20:28] with the old thoughts
[20:30] and coming forth with a new thoughts
[20:36] and being just
[20:40] right missing the whole truth
[20:43] go ahead brother Anderson and pull up
[20:45] Romans eight that's not the one I was
[20:47] looking for a while ago but Romans 8. I
[20:50] want to keep on that we was this morning
[20:54] Roman 8 uh 14 or 8 15 we'll start
[21:00] we're talking about heirs and join ours
[21:07] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[21:09] our spirit that we are the children of
[21:11] God
[21:14] and if children
[21:19] in heirs
[21:22] Heirs of God
[21:25] so whatever he has
[21:29] we have
[21:32] and in our day in terminologies now
[21:34] what's the point
[21:36] and our day and thoughts
[21:38] to get an inheritance means death
[21:41] of the one who
[21:43] has the
[21:45] property the material money whatever you
[21:48] want to call it right
[21:52] and see people say you know people will
[21:54] say well my God didn't die
[21:56] well who died on Calvary
[22:03] was that Jesus that died on Calvary
[22:07] sure
[22:13] but what happened there
[22:16] he within himself in the flesh could not
[22:19] give us anything
[22:22] that's why it starts off that we're
[22:24] Heirs of God
[22:31] we receive eternal life from God because
[22:34] he's the only one that had eternal life
[22:37] the flesh man Jesus didn't have eternal
[22:39] life
[22:42] him dying on a cross was an ability
[22:45] right
[22:46] to release the life
[22:50] that the life could come back on you and
[22:52] I and bring our inheritance to us
[22:55] which what is our inheritance
[22:58] the world
[23:01] who cares
[23:06] The Inheritance we need is sonship
[23:13] we use that word Loosely see we need
[23:16] children of God
[23:18] we need to be The Offspring of God
[23:21] not just Sons and Daughters of Jesus
[23:23] that was the son of God
[23:26] either Jesus was almighty God
[23:29] and we really are messed up
[23:32] see God dwelt in that flesh
[23:35] amen and death pulled that life out of
[23:39] him
[23:40] whose life God's life
[23:44] so that's why it says then
[23:46] in children
[23:48] and if children and The Heirs of God and
[23:51] join heirs with Christ
[23:57] now I've always believed this I don't
[23:59] believe when we get to heaven I mean
[24:01] it's just coming in the message
[24:03] I don't believe we're going to
[24:05] go up to heaven and we're going to see
[24:08] Jesus here
[24:10] and we're going to look over here in our
[24:11] little Halo we're gonna look over here
[24:14] and see another form or something
[24:17] I just
[24:19] since I saw one God I've never believed
[24:21] that
[24:24] I believe one day we will see Jesus and
[24:28] know who he is
[24:31] we'll know that he is father son Holy
[24:35] Ghost
[24:36] everything
[24:40] but only his children
[24:43] only his offspring I may not have it in
[24:46] here I got laid on the desk see only
[24:49] those who are predestinated
[24:53] can see
[24:56] the truth of one God
[25:01] there's people that would be given
[25:03] eternal life and to watch on judgment
[25:04] right
[25:06] you have your field sealed you let's
[25:08] give an eternal life
[25:10] you have your 144 000. that's given
[25:13] eternal life
[25:16] but none of them were the bride of
[25:17] Christ
[25:20] none of them are his offspring
[25:24] you agree
[25:27] see that if they're not his offspring
[25:29] his offspring is a special
[25:33] point but what is it
[25:35] it's a special designation of himself
[25:42] so what I was saying this morning now I
[25:45] believe that back before the world
[25:46] self-existing
[25:48] when he dwelt totally alone not a matter
[25:50] of molecule or anything
[25:55] that he had attributes
[25:59] and those attributes were his children
[26:04] now his children as I said this morning
[26:07] is not like our children
[26:10] the best we can do is our children
[26:13] all right
[26:14] but no see his children are the same as
[26:18] he is
[26:21] right
[26:22] and he was God made manifest
[26:27] in a human vessel
[26:32] right then we are to be God made
[26:35] manifest
[26:37] part of God
[26:40] because why because none of us can be
[26:43] the fullness
[26:46] but it takes all of us together to be
[26:48] the fullness as I was quoting this
[26:50] morning the prophet said
[26:52] God he is not complete without you
[26:58] but you mean God needs me
[27:03] now you don't need any of us
[27:06] get that out of your mind he don't need
[27:08] you at all
[27:09] right it's a wonderful glorious pleasure
[27:13] to realize and find out who you are
[27:16] right and then he can use you right
[27:20] he don't need us we need him
[27:24] but when we realize who we are and what
[27:26] we're doing here
[27:28] you realize you and I are to face Satan
[27:31] as no other age has ever faced him
[27:35] somebody's going to walk off this Earth
[27:37] without dying right
[27:39] you agree right
[27:42] well that means somebody's going to
[27:43] realize who they are
[27:48] now get out of that cobweb things in our
[27:51] brains it keeps running us back to
[27:54] thoughts and you know
[27:56] well mama said you know you know we're
[27:59] not God now son we're a son of God
[28:02] well that was good in Mama's Day
[28:05] she had a good point
[28:07] now we ought to understand it a Son of
[28:10] God is God made manifest
[28:13] in another form
[28:16] that's the Simplicity to me to the
[28:18] godhead
[28:21] because if the God is not complete
[28:23] without you
[28:26] then we certainly not run into a Oneness
[28:28] Doctrine
[28:30] remember the one that's doctor and one
[28:32] like your finger
[28:33] they believe that Jesus was the last
[28:36] form of God
[28:38] I don't believe that
[28:40] I believe you
[28:43] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:46] the new birth in you
[28:48] is the last form of God to the Gentiles
[28:52] then he goes to the Jews
[28:55] and he goes to the white throne
[28:58] he has many more ways of manifesting
[29:00] itself
[29:03] when I believe the bride of Christ is
[29:05] the last form of God
[29:07] in morphe change his form into another
[29:10] form
[29:11] he's not here now in Corporal body he's
[29:14] in you and I
[29:17] that's why he can't step back on Earth
[29:20] you don't you don't think like that
[29:22] why would it be that he can't come back
[29:24] to earth
[29:26] because he came back to Earth he'd be in
[29:28] the body and we'd be in a body so it'd
[29:30] mess it all up
[29:32] but by the time we meet him in the air
[29:34] we're going to be as he is which is
[29:37] eternal
[29:38] then we can Fellowship together
[29:42] think about it your simple points
[29:47] see we how we are a part of God
[29:51] by the eternal life that we have in our
[29:54] soul by the new birth
[29:57] that new birth makes us a child of God
[30:00] or if you want to call it a son of God
[30:04] there's no problem with it
[30:06] the prophet could call him Jesus the son
[30:08] of God
[30:12] but he never called him God the son
[30:15] you know
[30:18] he called him Son of God the Bible
[30:20] called him Son of God
[30:22] but not God the son because that's the
[30:24] second person
[30:27] I don't believe in that
[30:32] notice now
[30:35] we say we don't believe in eternal
[30:37] sonship
[30:42] what do we mean then
[30:44] we only talking about Jesus Christ
[30:51] are we just talking about that he was
[30:53] not an eternal son
[30:55] why would you want to be an eternal son
[31:01] see you're separating yourself from the
[31:03] real truth of the understanding of the
[31:05] word of God
[31:08] to be the children of God
[31:11] is not to be another person
[31:16] to be the children of God is to be the
[31:18] children of God
[31:19] a part of God
[31:23] and he didn't make us and put us over
[31:26] here
[31:28] right
[31:29] ah
[31:33] I don't look around at my kids and say
[31:36] well I tell you what you better behave
[31:37] yourself because I made you
[31:39] and I can I can take you out of
[31:41] existence
[31:42] maybe I needed to whoop them a little
[31:44] bit but
[31:46] you know I never wanted to take them out
[31:48] of existence
[31:50] why because they're part of me
[31:54] all right but you know what they're just
[31:56] apart they're part of the mother too you
[32:00] can run the DNA of the mother all the
[32:01] way back as much as you can run the
[32:02] father back
[32:04] we just lay upon the father line because
[32:07] of the the ego I guess the men have but
[32:12] to think we're something
[32:17] well you know what
[32:19] God was able to get Jesus Christ here
[32:22] without
[32:24] Joseph and Mary
[32:27] right
[32:29] he could have put him on a rock
[32:32] and done the same thing
[32:35] but it would not Abate him Akin folks
[32:38] so he didn't choose to do it that way
[32:41] he could have spoke him into existence
[32:43] he had done that many times
[32:47] when he went down to the the three you
[32:50] know going to Abraham and two going on
[32:52] to Sodom he had spoke bodies into
[32:54] existence
[32:56] that had done that
[32:57] but it wouldn't have been kin folks
[33:00] so you would not know dealing of calling
[33:02] us joint heirs
[33:06] he join ours to me means that I've got
[33:09] you so much as you got
[33:12] that's joined
[33:14] you know
[33:15] all right you got 51 and I got 49 that's
[33:18] not join ours
[33:22] means the same
[33:25] amen now how did he I wrote my thought
[33:27] here to hold it until we could break
[33:29] them down
[33:32] how
[33:33] how did Jesus get anything
[33:39] I said Jesus well I'm in it the man
[33:42] flesh
[33:44] how did the flesh man get anything
[33:47] first off God was in the flesh
[33:51] second off what was in him changed his
[33:53] body
[33:55] right
[33:56] well it's not that to What's Happening
[33:58] Now by the new birth
[34:00] God is living in us and he's going to
[34:02] change these bodies
[34:06] we just won't be the fullness of the
[34:09] godhead as one person
[34:13] but all together around the world we
[34:15] make up the bride of Christ
[34:18] his children
[34:22] and see if you get the scripture then
[34:23] you can can depend on things and do it
[34:26] where the Bible said back there you'll
[34:27] be with your offspring
[34:31] and God quickened that to me one day and
[34:33] he said
[34:35] your children will be there
[34:38] they're sitting here
[34:41] the grandkids is on the way
[34:43] and the great grandkids is on the way
[34:50] you see I have no problems with claiming
[34:53] uh you know like you'd say well now let
[34:56] me get this right
[34:59] oh
[35:00] Terence was getting the life out of
[35:02] everything so we use him to talk huh
[35:08] okay
[35:10] now he's my son
[35:13] he said well God told you your children
[35:15] will be saved
[35:18] see now here's your narrow-minded
[35:23] I believe Terence married the girl he's
[35:24] supposed to marry
[35:30] I believe Wade married a girl he was
[35:32] supposed to marry I believe I ain't a
[35:34] married divorce he's supposed to marry I
[35:35] believe that
[35:41] and you know what I believe that makes
[35:43] them one
[35:46] right
[35:48] right well when he said I'd be there
[35:50] with my Offspring you mean I'm going to
[35:52] leave my daughter-in-laws or son-in-laws
[35:53] out of it
[35:59] I don't believe it that way
[36:04] I claim them all
[36:07] and one by one they're going to come
[36:11] you just keep doing it
[36:14] just don't quit when everything gets to
[36:16] go in the worst is when you believe the
[36:19] most
[36:19] right
[36:21] and everything looked like it's totally
[36:22] gone there's no hopes
[36:26] right at the ends when you start saying
[36:28] I believe
[36:32] do you notice I used to tell her I said
[36:34] every time I look at wait I laugh at him
[36:38] not life and because it was wrong with
[36:40] life
[36:41] I just know that he's going through a
[36:43] hard Road
[36:46] but he's coming
[36:48] why because he's your child no
[36:51] come on no
[36:53] but because I as a child of God claim my
[36:57] children
[36:59] why can't you do that with yours
[37:02] yeah but mine's out there in the world
[37:04] of love
[37:07] you used to be lost somebody claimed you
[37:13] come on
[37:16] another run said some old great
[37:17] grandmother back down through there
[37:19] prayed for you
[37:26] I don't charge you on that part I just
[37:28] leave it okay
[37:29] yeah
[37:31] but I thought
[37:34] that we were supposed to believe the
[37:35] prophet
[37:37] I thought the prophet said that God
[37:40] would hear his child
[37:42] more than he would hear an angel you
[37:46] remember them quotes
[37:48] more than he'd hear an angel
[37:53] and see he never sent an angel down to
[37:55] die
[37:57] right
[37:59] and he never sent her son to die
[38:03] he came himself
[38:08] I can show you what the prophet said he
[38:10] said one day he said that's too big of a
[38:12] job I'm going myself
[38:17] that's just so expression right or
[38:20] showing you emphasizing the the fact
[38:22] that what he believed about he said I'm
[38:24] not going to send us I'm going myself
[38:26] too big of a job
[38:30] see he hasn't chosen us for this no
[38:33] purpose whatsoever
[38:35] he has chosen you and I to end this
[38:38] whole thing up
[38:40] I'm gonna quit writing notes
[38:44] I don't get to follow him anymore
[38:49] but listen Church
[38:53] God has saved the best to last
[38:57] you want to know anything about what I
[38:58] believe about God
[39:00] but he has not went to heaven to stay up
[39:03] there
[39:05] he's down here
[39:08] I love it when the prophet said that one
[39:10] day
[39:11] he said even though he knew the end from
[39:13] the beginning even though he could see
[39:15] Israel and all her he said he didn't go
[39:17] up to heaven and sit down
[39:19] did he come down to live it with him
[39:22] you want some more quotes
[39:26] he said
[39:28] that God one day said
[39:31] I'm going to go down to Sodom
[39:34] to make sure that things that I've heard
[39:36] are right
[39:38] now he's infinite God he knew everything
[39:41] about Sodom
[39:43] right
[39:45] but yet he said I'm going down
[39:50] I think he's still here
[39:54] what you're looking at just gonna get
[39:55] the ride to go off of this Earth
[39:57] because of the vessel it's in we'll get
[39:59] to that when we talk about the seed they
[40:02] come predestinated eternally
[40:05] we're getting over a little bit and then
[40:06] we'll start going back down through and
[40:08] come over back into time with it
[40:10] what I'm talking about now let me get on
[40:12] to the thought we're talking about the
[40:13] children of God
[40:17] not as secondary persons
[40:21] because children would go of God would
[40:24] imply now listen to what I'm saying I'll
[40:26] quote the rest of that in a second
[40:29] to be children of God in our human
[40:32] terminologies means we've got to have a
[40:34] mom and a daddy
[40:37] right right that's sensible
[40:41] requirement right
[40:43] daddy can't do it by itself
[40:46] right
[40:48] you'll see one of these days we ain't
[40:50] let Eve come in the garden
[40:51] I believe Eve was going to speak the
[40:53] word
[40:55] you should have just stayed with it Adam
[40:57] did not just speak it all the time he
[40:59] could have took care of it
[41:01] she just goofed up by getting her own
[41:03] intelligence in the way
[41:07] God is waiting on the bride
[41:12] to realize who she is what she's doing
[41:14] here
[41:16] where he can pour into her his
[41:18] revelation
[41:21] and I stated again like in the days of
[41:24] Martin Luther how many times did Martin
[41:26] Luther preach on the just you live by
[41:28] faith
[41:29] may have done great teachings on it
[41:33] because it's what he was see
[41:35] but one day it was quickened unto him he
[41:38] said you just shall live by faith he
[41:40] tackled the world
[41:43] and overcome the world with that because
[41:46] it's something real what do you think is
[41:48] going to help us keep us I mean what do
[41:50] you think is keeping us from walking off
[41:52] of here
[41:56] we don't have it the way we need it
[41:59] right and until we get it we'll keep on
[42:01] hammering it out
[42:03] until somebody says that's it right
[42:06] there
[42:07] and then what it is it'll take place
[42:10] well
[42:11] see because we are not a second person
[42:13] we are God made manifest
[42:17] upon the Earth
[42:19] a part of God
[42:23] I wish I could open up our heads and
[42:25] pour that into us
[42:29] to where we could see it
[42:32] but listen to what he said let's go back
[42:34] and I'll try to get in the notes
[42:37] go ahead we're number one brother
[42:43] let's talk about this eternal sonship
[42:46] I want this quote First into your mind
[42:49] taking officers we would see Jesus 1961
[42:52] or 09 paragraph e or E8
[42:57] and only anything that had a beginning
[42:59] has an end
[43:01] and only anything that had as a
[43:04] beginning as an end it's just those
[43:06] things which do did not begin
[43:08] has no end that's Eternal
[43:11] eternity has neither beginning or end
[43:14] and the only way that we can have
[43:17] eternal life is receive part of him in
[43:22] US
[43:23] now is that enough
[43:26] he said that's the only way
[43:28] yeah but I got it figured out we come
[43:30] this way and we can see now you're
[43:32] facing the prophet
[43:34] he said that's the only way
[43:39] you have a brother so-and-so made it's
[43:40] so beautiful now that they had this
[43:42] light and I remember one of them had
[43:43] this big old light up here and then he
[43:45] brought the light over and he brought it
[43:47] down this way and then he'd bring it
[43:49] over
[43:51] and I thought
[43:53] it looks beautiful
[43:56] but I thought a minute
[43:59] I thought that ain't right
[44:03] see something inside of me just said
[44:04] that ain't right
[44:06] you know why
[44:07] because he took all of this
[44:10] and he put it over here
[44:14] he left nothing here
[44:17] but everybody shouted about the
[44:19] Beautiful
[44:20] illustrations
[44:26] do you realize a quote right around and
[44:28] said is going to kill you if you can't
[44:30] get it right all God was he poured into
[44:33] Christ you remember that one
[44:38] and all Christ he poured into the church
[44:44] well I know you don't think it's carnal
[44:46] as I do but try it on let's try it a
[44:49] little bit every once in a while to be
[44:50] carnal instead of being so Holy Ghost
[44:52] revelated until everything is spiritual
[44:59] oh God was
[45:02] he poured into Christ
[45:04] you have no God anymore
[45:09] you got Christ
[45:13] all Christ poured in the church you
[45:16] don't know Christ anymore you have a
[45:17] church
[45:22] you don't realize what you've just done
[45:25] you totally done away with God
[45:27] and you left the people
[45:30] I'm not talking about something like
[45:32] that now
[45:35] the man would have had a beautiful
[45:36] picture if he'd draw it and left his
[45:37] Halo and he said now that Halo came over
[45:40] here and down here to begin to create
[45:43] Etc
[45:44] but never took nothing away from here
[45:48] you realize when that the prophet
[45:51] explained in question and answered Jesus
[45:53] that the sun went out
[45:56] he said not like an arm going off he's
[45:58] trying to explain it
[46:00] there was just as much of God here as it
[46:03] was over here
[46:07] come on have you done goofing it up
[46:10] do you take that God and you put it take
[46:12] the quote all God was he poured into
[46:15] Christ you don't do away with God he's
[46:17] still sitting right here looking he
[46:19] poured into Christ the son right
[46:22] you take all that and you pour it into
[46:24] church and you do away with nothing
[46:27] it increases
[46:31] God is expanding expanding himself
[46:34] brother won't preach that 1971.
[46:38] God expanding himself
[46:45] every time a child is born into the body
[46:49] is expanding God
[46:54] see we want to make a beautiful picture
[46:56] out of it though
[46:57] Brothers at my house one day and he said
[46:59] something I said my Lord man
[47:01] he went to God got drawn out he ain't
[47:03] even right it's a beautiful picture
[47:09] I can make you a beautiful picture they
[47:10] don't make it right
[47:13] he just going by a beautiful picture
[47:17] okay
[47:19] and the only way that we can have
[47:21] eternal life is
[47:22] receive part of him in US
[47:25] and that makes us sons and daughters
[47:27] what with God's life in US
[47:31] then we have eternal life
[47:35] as we are Sons and Daughters of God
[47:39] therefore we're Eternal with God
[47:45] when we receive
[47:47] eternal life
[47:50] there's only one way to do it
[47:54] how do you get eternal life
[47:57] that's to be born of this Holy Spirit
[47:59] the only way we can have eternal life is
[48:03] to be born of his spirit
[48:12] how can it feel like it I just feel like
[48:14] I always was
[48:18] it got to do with feelings
[48:21] what does the word of God say
[48:24] all right
[48:26] so I give you that to where we you won't
[48:28] I keep interlacing thoughts about our
[48:31] our quotes about that we must be born
[48:33] again to keep you from from settling
[48:37] down on a thought
[48:38] of trying to get it to try to make us
[48:40] something
[48:41] they were not
[48:43] the Bible said it is he that hath made
[48:45] us and not we ourselves
[48:48] so whatever we are God made us
[48:53] why not just have a good time
[48:58] you know I I pray to God
[49:02] and I've been around Prior Warriors I'm
[49:04] just not one I've never been one I'm
[49:05] sorry
[49:06] now your people make so beautiful
[49:08] prayers you know
[49:10] you know
[49:12] they seem like the Heavenly anthems
[49:14] opened up
[49:16] and all I can do is say Lord
[49:18] you know I'm sorry
[49:20] I ain't done too good today
[49:23] you know I let things get in my way I
[49:26] got upset I got this I got that I got
[49:28] problems I got troubles
[49:32] and I say well Lord would you help me
[49:38] when I have the kids
[49:41] they don't come over to the house
[49:44] Daddy
[49:45] I'd like to talk to you a little while
[49:48] you know we are your children and we're
[49:50] I say what do you want
[49:53] that's what I'd say right but they don't
[49:55] do it that way because that's not the
[49:56] way to approach it
[49:58] they just go to the house and say we
[50:00] need so and so I said go get it
[50:04] my kids has got a key to my house
[50:05] everything I got they got a key to it
[50:12] they come in the house get what they
[50:13] want
[50:14] they don't have to write down what they
[50:16] got
[50:19] well because they're my children
[50:23] I want them to be that away
[50:27] I want them to be the whether they can
[50:28] be at home
[50:31] me
[50:33] you know the old thing I never did see
[50:36] very much of it but was it called Dallas
[50:39] on a woman that called something 40 back
[50:42] to them you know South Fork or something
[50:44] south Florida you know they all live in
[50:47] that big old house
[50:49] you know
[50:51] and you know that's what I do with my
[50:52] kids
[50:53] if I'd had a house big enough
[50:56] of course I'd want them a private door
[50:58] where they could go out and I'd want a
[51:00] private door where I could go out
[51:07] but I'd love to handle just everyone in
[51:08] the same house
[51:10] we do that anyway it's no problem
[51:16] talking about the children of God
[51:19] all right let's get on the Eternal
[51:21] sonship let's talk about it a minute
[51:24] I'll try to get through in a hurry I've
[51:25] got communion go to number two which is
[51:27] revelation of Jesus Christ verse 1960
[51:30] 1205 in the morning service
[51:33] and look what he says about eternal
[51:34] sonship
[51:39] I want to ask you some of you precious
[51:41] Catholic people who call that the
[51:43] Eternal sonship of God God Eternal ship
[51:46] of Jesus Christ with God
[51:49] how can you say such a word
[51:51] I'm a dummy with a seventh grade
[51:53] education but I know better than that
[51:55] the word son has to have a beginning
[51:58] so how can he be Eternal and be a son
[52:03] eternity has no beginning or end
[52:05] so he can't be a son an eternal son he
[52:08] can't be
[52:10] all right
[52:11] now remember the point of what I'm
[52:13] getting at I spent this morning and half
[52:15] of the day whatever he is we're join
[52:17] ours
[52:19] when you're explaining him you're
[52:20] explaining us
[52:22] that's the way he done it not about what
[52:25] I decided to do
[52:28] look
[52:30] he can't be a son
[52:32] and he's an eternal son
[52:34] and then have a beginning because
[52:36] there's no such a thing as an eternal
[52:38] son
[52:39] my son had a beginning so he can't be
[52:42] Eternal you see he is the Eternal God
[52:47] not
[52:48] the Eternal son
[52:50] he says Glory
[52:53] Almighty Jehovah come down and made
[52:56] manifest and dwelt with us
[52:59] look what he says he is the Eternal God
[53:01] not the Eternal son
[53:09] why because
[53:14] he is God
[53:17] what are we supposed to be go to the
[53:19] next one
[53:24] this is
[53:26] questions and answers
[53:29] Hebrews part two paragraph 3385.
[53:34] or as I have went through it the
[53:37] Catholic
[53:38] call it the Eternal sonship of God
[53:41] which is I have said before the word
[53:43] doesn't even make sense
[53:45] see there cannot be an eternal son
[53:49] because a son had to have a beginning
[53:54] so now you can't but he can't be you
[53:57] can't be an eternal son
[54:02] come on
[54:04] and so Jesus had a beginning
[54:06] God had no beginning see but the son now
[54:10] he's explaining
[54:12] what he was how did it could come to
[54:14] pipe but the son was not Eternal Eternal
[54:17] Sunshine but the son that was with the
[54:20] father in the beginning was the logos
[54:23] that went out of God
[54:26] now what was we explaining the logos
[54:28] that went out of God
[54:31] the word the speech
[54:34] that was God in another form
[54:37] not another God
[54:43] and it was the theophany that went out
[54:46] the human form that didn't have eyes
[54:48] like you see the better eye didn't have
[54:51] the ears like it here but a far more
[54:53] hearing
[54:55] see it was a theophany that with all
[54:57] this rainbow condescended into theophany
[55:00] Moses saw it when it passed through the
[55:02] rock like that he saw the back Parts
[55:05] said it looked like a man
[55:09] even the scholars go if you've got a
[55:11] Scofield bible go back and read Genesis
[55:15] and you'll see it talking about
[55:19] logos God Etc
[55:22] and then when it talks about the
[55:23] creation you'll see him using the word
[55:26] Sun
[55:30] because it was a word
[55:34] see they know that much about it but how
[55:36] much do we know about it look at the
[55:38] next one
[55:42] this is Christ is revealed in his own
[55:44] word
[55:45] 65 822 paragraph 53 54.
[55:49] my son is the Catholic Church puts it
[55:51] Eternal son
[55:53] and all the rest of the churches
[55:58] the word don't even make sense
[56:02] so evidently now all the churches
[56:04] believe in eternal sonship
[56:10] now
[56:12] you're going to argue the quote with him
[56:14] go ahead
[56:16] see there cannot be any turn be Eternal
[56:18] and be there and be a son because the
[56:20] sun is something that's begotten from
[56:22] and the word Eternal it cannot be any he
[56:25] can be a son but he cannot be an eternal
[56:28] son no sir it cannot be an eternal son
[56:34] but now he is the son
[56:36] so much
[56:38] now he's explaining what it is that all
[56:41] the word that was in Jeremiah and Moses
[56:43] all them
[56:45] they spoke of me
[56:48] that's why he's a son
[56:50] that's why he was called a son
[56:52] that's the reason he was called son
[56:54] reason he refers father why it's just as
[56:58] simple as you can just let God pour it
[57:01] to you pour it into you all right God
[57:04] revealed in a body of Flesh
[57:07] notice reveal from flesh are from word
[57:10] unto flesh
[57:13] that's what he was
[57:16] God was revealed in flesh
[57:20] we call that a son
[57:23] so evidently everybody believes eternal
[57:25] sonship
[57:31] he said all the other churches go ahead
[57:34] let me read fast
[57:36] who is God 1906 or 50. I go backers and
[57:40] fourth word
[57:41] I'll go from 65 to 50 to 47 to see that
[57:45] he's holding the same thought back here
[57:46] as he's holding over here that's where
[57:48] everybody thinks he had this thought
[57:49] over here and then he changed his
[57:51] thought over there
[57:54] right
[57:56] well he learned better after the third
[57:59] pool
[58:03] and I agree that there was things open
[58:05] after the third book but it's like Wade
[58:07] said when we were
[58:09] facing some people about it
[58:12] and the people were saying we'll take
[58:14] what he said after the word and you know
[58:17] the sword in the hand
[58:20] all right
[58:22] we'll go back and read
[58:24] The Sword in the hand was out in Sabina
[58:26] Canyon or whatever
[58:27] and he come back to Jeffersonville
[58:30] under that anointing it was fixed the
[58:32] priest the white horse rider
[58:34] wrong on the first seal
[58:41] sure
[58:45] you hadn't heard that doctor in that
[58:46] long and that's 40 years that's 50
[58:48] almost 50 years ago
[58:51] and he was right over here so far the
[58:53] message then he was wrong and the son of
[58:55] man come down and straightened him out
[58:59] well I'd like to know where he
[59:00] straightened him out
[59:03] because he was born to prophet
[59:06] and they're that great space for that no
[59:08] no one can fathom it in their mind
[59:10] beyond that that space eternity it's
[59:12] Jehovah God out there and we're taught
[59:14] in the beginning that the logars or the
[59:17] Son of God went out of God
[59:19] now I do not believe in eternal sonship
[59:23] he's always getting us away from
[59:24] believing what
[59:27] he's telling us that he called him a son
[59:28] but don't believe in eternal sonship
[59:31] okay
[59:33] that's even radical to even think
[59:35] even mentioned such a thing
[59:37] eternal sonship
[59:39] how he had a Eternal substances they're
[59:42] saying he had an eternal wait it's even
[59:45] it's even Eternal sonship how could he
[59:48] be a son he had to have a beginning see
[59:51] all right look at your neck
[59:54] number six
[59:57] Revelation Jesus Christ page 21 Church
[59:59] age book people talk about Jesus being
[1:00:02] the Eternal Son of God
[1:00:04] now he isn't that a contradiction
[1:00:05] whoever heard of a son being Eternal
[1:00:08] sons have Beginnings with that which is
[1:00:11] eternal never had a beginning he is the
[1:00:13] Eternal god Jehovah manifested in the
[1:00:17] flesh
[1:00:18] so is it today
[1:00:21] he's the same Eternal Jehovah God
[1:00:23] manifested in flesh right
[1:00:27] if we just realize it
[1:00:28] look at the next one
[1:00:31] wisdom versus Faith 62 401.
[1:00:35] Burger of 87-88
[1:00:37] and here's a little thought that you
[1:00:39] everything that had a beginning had an
[1:00:40] ending but it's the things that did not
[1:00:42] have a beginning that doesn't end the
[1:00:45] only thing that's eternal
[1:00:47] therefore I'd like to ask the question
[1:00:50] how could we ever make sense out of the
[1:00:52] word of the Eternal sonship of God if he
[1:00:56] was a son he had a beginning
[1:00:58] if he was eternal son how could he be a
[1:01:01] son and be eternal her son is is a
[1:01:04] product of something
[1:01:05] but if he was
[1:01:07] he was could not be an eternal son
[1:01:10] there's no such a thing
[1:01:12] Eternal sonship of God there's no Son of
[1:01:15] God all right there's no such thing as
[1:01:16] an eternal Son of God God If he if he
[1:01:19] ever had a beginning
[1:01:21] he cannot be nothing but Eternal no I
[1:01:24] don't
[1:01:26] but if he was a son he had a beginning
[1:01:29] so he cannot be an eternal son
[1:01:34] it was the Eternal God manifested in a
[1:01:38] son
[1:01:42] well it's it's in the Sun
[1:01:48] uh-huh see
[1:01:50] Eternal God because God is the only
[1:01:52] thing that's Eternal I'm wanting to get
[1:01:54] down to one more that I got in here so
[1:01:57] hold on a second
[1:01:59] let me see if I can cuddle no we don't
[1:02:00] want to cut too much go to number nine
[1:02:05] because I want you to listen to the
[1:02:06] thought
[1:02:08] going to number nine which is thirsting
[1:02:10] for life
[1:02:11] 57
[1:02:14] 6 30.
[1:02:17] the book called The Facts of our faith
[1:02:19] and they use the word of Eternal sonship
[1:02:21] of God
[1:02:22] the word don't even make sense to me the
[1:02:25] word Eternal means eternity which had no
[1:02:28] beginning or has no end and the son
[1:02:30] means at a beginning so how could it
[1:02:34] what it could be a eternal godship
[1:02:43] you can have an eternal godship
[1:02:47] but not an eternal sonship
[1:02:51] a lot of difference what is eternal
[1:02:53] godship
[1:02:54] God living in many vessels
[1:03:00] eternal godship
[1:03:01] but never Eternal sonship a son is one
[1:03:04] that had a beginning
[1:03:05] what's what he's explained what it is
[1:03:07] and the low Gods which was the son of
[1:03:09] God went out created by these great
[1:03:12] Fountains of Purity God is those Spirits
[1:03:16] went out and it created the logos and it
[1:03:20] was a body he goes on to explain it it
[1:03:22] was a theophany of what it was doing but
[1:03:25] do you get what he's saying
[1:03:26] it could be an eternal godship
[1:03:33] but not an eternal sonship
[1:03:36] all right
[1:03:39] let's get the next one
[1:03:41] which is Hebrews chapter 5 and 6.
[1:03:44] be number 10.
[1:03:47] progress 64 is where we're going to
[1:03:50] he didn't have three people up there and
[1:03:52] sent one of them
[1:03:55] his son he didn't do that
[1:03:58] it was God himself come down in the form
[1:04:00] of a son
[1:04:01] because what are you going to call like
[1:04:02] I said this morning or when it was the
[1:04:05] three Hebrew children down in the fiery
[1:04:06] furnace and that never could have to
[1:04:08] look down in there and he seen these
[1:04:10] people being taken care of and not being
[1:04:11] hurt in a fiery furnace that killed the
[1:04:14] people that throwed them in seven times
[1:04:16] harder than it ever been to help he did
[1:04:18] before
[1:04:19] what would you call it
[1:04:21] didn't we throw in three yeah well
[1:04:23] there's four in there and one of them is
[1:04:25] like the Son of God if I could see the
[1:04:28] movement I've got to put a sonship apart
[1:04:30] connecting you know if you can see
[1:04:32] something visible
[1:04:34] all right you put a sonship form of the
[1:04:36] word
[1:04:36] all right
[1:04:38] but then you realize if he's taking care
[1:04:39] of the rest of him he's got to be God
[1:04:43] so he said he's locking to the son of
[1:04:45] God
[1:04:48] and look
[1:04:50] it was God himself came in the form of
[1:04:53] son son at the beginning and then Sunday
[1:04:55] a son has a beginning and the son that
[1:04:57] had a beginning and some of you you're
[1:05:00] Catholic people I got your book facts of
[1:05:02] our faith said the Eternal sonship of
[1:05:04] God how are you going to express that
[1:05:06] word how are you going to make it how
[1:05:09] sense how can it be Eternal that's not
[1:05:11] the Bible that's your book
[1:05:14] Eternal citizenship they don't that word
[1:05:16] is not right or anything that's the son
[1:05:18] had a beginning an eternal has
[1:05:21] no beginning so it isn't Eternal sonship
[1:05:24] Christ become God the Flesh and dwelt
[1:05:27] Among Us he had a beginning
[1:05:30] wasn't no Eternal sonship it's the
[1:05:33] Eternal godhead
[1:05:35] not sonship
[1:05:38] now think on that
[1:05:42] an eternal godship
[1:05:45] not an eternal son
[1:05:49] not an eternal sonship
[1:05:51] an eternal godhead
[1:05:55] that's the way I believe the way I do
[1:05:56] Father Son and Holy Ghost makes the
[1:05:58] godhead right
[1:06:00] amen right now is that that the godhead
[1:06:03] that was the scripture I was going to
[1:06:04] use that part of doing showing it but
[1:06:06] anyhow
[1:06:07] Father Son and Holy Ghost is the godhead
[1:06:10] you take out any part of that
[1:06:14] and you know how the godhead complete
[1:06:19] so you take us out of it you don't have
[1:06:21] the godhead to complete
[1:06:23] God we're his offspring
[1:06:26] see that's what I believe about an
[1:06:27] eternal God
[1:06:29] Eternal sonship and watch
[1:06:32] and I know the scripture I preached on
[1:06:33] it many years so don't worry I'll get to
[1:06:35] it in a second
[1:06:37] but the Bible said that God made me all
[1:06:39] in all you know there'll be a time when
[1:06:41] the sonship
[1:06:43] won't be in existence
[1:06:46] but will it be destroyed no
[1:06:52] won't be destroyed that's what we think
[1:06:54] see we think up here all this was great
[1:06:57] big thing and then it come down here and
[1:06:59] just leave a vacuum up here
[1:07:03] when we get dire folks
[1:07:05] and we see Jesus
[1:07:08] the Bible to be fulfilled where he said
[1:07:10] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[1:07:16] we won't be looking at a father son the
[1:07:18] Holy Ghost under a trinity Doctrine
[1:07:22] we will see Jesus Christ and know that
[1:07:24] he's almighty God
[1:07:26] he will be Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:07:27] still standing right there you never do
[1:07:30] away with anything in God
[1:07:32] now come on that's one of the things
[1:07:34] that will keep a key that will help you
[1:07:36] anything God ever had he'll always have
[1:07:42] anything's a part of him that's why the
[1:07:45] hell's not eternal
[1:07:47] it's not a part of God
[1:07:51] that's why Sinners not Eternal it's not
[1:07:53] a part of God
[1:07:56] it will be annihilated is not a part of
[1:07:59] God
[1:08:03] but anything's a part of him will never
[1:08:05] be done away with him
[1:08:06] show me something that's done away in
[1:08:08] God
[1:08:11] that's why I believe in all the gifts
[1:08:14] I'm leaving all the things the Bible the
[1:08:16] nine spiritual gifts and all of that I
[1:08:18] believe in every one of them
[1:08:22] and see the prophet said we're going to
[1:08:24] have to answer for the gifts not working
[1:08:26] in this church
[1:08:28] let me tell you one thing about it this
[1:08:29] boy's never stopped him
[1:08:33] but don't you worry about it we can put
[1:08:34] it in order
[1:08:37] we got the word we put it in order
[1:08:39] if it comes out wrong we just get them
[1:08:40] tell you it's wrong
[1:08:43] well now you got the Holy Ghost you're
[1:08:44] gonna get mad at me cause I told you
[1:08:45] you're wrong
[1:08:48] come on
[1:08:50] if you get mad at me for telling you
[1:08:52] you're wrong you don't have the Holy
[1:08:54] Ghost
[1:08:58] now you might have problems with what I
[1:09:00] say but you can't argue about it
[1:09:04] why because you prove you're lost
[1:09:07] that's where people don't understand me
[1:09:09] I don't have any problems were you
[1:09:11] telling me brother Dale I don't agree
[1:09:13] with you
[1:09:15] that don't bother me but don't go tell
[1:09:17] everybody else you don't agree tell me
[1:09:19] then go tell them
[1:09:22] put in the
[1:09:25] newspaper the next day but come to me
[1:09:27] first
[1:09:28] because it might be something you and I
[1:09:30] are misunderstanding not going to the
[1:09:32] man the other day about something he
[1:09:33] said I just don't agree on I said
[1:09:34] brother it's it's
[1:09:36] you don't understand I'm trying to say
[1:09:38] the same thing you're saying I'm just
[1:09:40] using other words
[1:09:44] I said I'm not different will you I
[1:09:45] agree with you
[1:09:47] but it's just the way I see it the way I
[1:09:48] express it
[1:09:50] you know
[1:09:52] because I believe if you've got the Holy
[1:09:54] Ghost the Holy Ghost is going to keep
[1:09:55] you straight
[1:09:58] but don't thank your feelings
[1:10:01] can't be heard because it can
[1:10:04] remember your feelings is on the outside
[1:10:07] we're in the spirit and the thing
[1:10:11] somebody tells you the truth it's only
[1:10:13] about the flesh but it's Amen for the
[1:10:16] inside of the hand right that's the
[1:10:18] difference in it
[1:10:24] you mean you'd get mad at me brother
[1:10:26] Marlo with me telling you the truth and
[1:10:28] I'll save your soul
[1:10:31] you might not like what I say
[1:10:33] in my terminologies
[1:10:35] you're not going to get upset with me
[1:10:37] why because you don't know the truth is
[1:10:39] the truth
[1:10:42] you might tell us I wish you'd said it
[1:10:43] some other time or a little kinder well
[1:10:46] that may be true
[1:10:49] the church I'm trying to tell you about
[1:10:51] God and his ways and doing but to
[1:10:54] express it to you to see yourself
[1:10:57] well the Lord will in the next message I
[1:10:59] may take some more and if not then we're
[1:11:01] going to start coming back this way
[1:11:03] toward time
[1:11:06] but we got a lot to preach before we can
[1:11:08] get into time
[1:11:09] we've got God's foreknowledge
[1:11:12] in his predestination and the writing of
[1:11:14] The Book of Life
[1:11:16] we got the morning Stars saying together
[1:11:18] and the sons of God shouted for joy
[1:11:20] we got all of those things to deal with
[1:11:22] before we can get back down to earth
[1:11:27] but my whole point is one thing
[1:11:30] we are the children of God
[1:11:33] and if children then we're Heirs of God
[1:11:35] because that's the way we become the
[1:11:37] children of God Is by receiving his
[1:11:40] eternal life
[1:11:41] and we're join ours with Jesus Christ
[1:11:43] that that logos that came out to come
[1:11:45] down
[1:11:46] see to do you or not or join ours with
[1:11:50] it if he had a right to speak the words
[1:11:52] you've got to write to speak the word
[1:11:53] that's where we're living below our
[1:11:55] privileges as the bride of Christ
[1:11:59] I know what it is folks I live in this
[1:12:01] human vessel
[1:12:03] and I start something starts coming and
[1:12:06] when it does the devil will come and I
[1:12:07] said but look what you've done look what
[1:12:08] you've done look what you've done
[1:12:09] yesterday look what you've done here
[1:12:10] look what you said look what
[1:12:12] right that's right come on am I hitting
[1:12:16] you
[1:12:17] something gets you on your shoulder and
[1:12:18] I'll tell you you ain't worthy of
[1:12:19] speaking
[1:12:21] the best thing to do is say Satan you're
[1:12:23] right uh ain't worthy but my daddy told
[1:12:27] me to ask amen he didn't tell me how
[1:12:30] good I was that he'd answer me
[1:12:34] if one of my kids went out and murdered
[1:12:36] and done everything in the world you
[1:12:38] know I would never reject them as my
[1:12:41] children
[1:12:43] they would still be my children
[1:12:48] well because they're my children
[1:12:51] I'd love them and everything else and
[1:12:52] try to help them in any way
[1:12:58] but you understand what I'm saying
[1:13:04] whatever Jesus Christ has or Christ is
[1:13:06] the Bible called it so Christ was able
[1:13:09] to create the world is that the
[1:13:11] scripture
[1:13:12] does the bible say that all things were
[1:13:14] created by Jesus Christ
[1:13:17] and without him there was not anything
[1:13:18] made that was made
[1:13:21] and when he came here on Earth he proved
[1:13:23] that he was one it was back there that
[1:13:25] said let there be he stood right here on
[1:13:27] Earth and said hey
[1:13:30] even before they'd rece received the new
[1:13:32] birth
[1:13:33] he said I knew you before the foundation
[1:13:35] of the world
[1:13:40] that's what he says about the disciples
[1:13:41] now don't go try to find that in the
[1:13:43] scripture on a lot of you got to give up
[1:13:45] but go to brother random and let him
[1:13:46] explain it
[1:13:49] he said Jesus said he knew them before
[1:13:51] the foundation of the world
[1:13:53] and I had Glory with you
[1:13:56] we don't remember it right
[1:13:59] why because we were only attributes
[1:14:02] the disciples don't remember it they
[1:14:04] were only attributes
[1:14:06] he wasn't having fellowship with them as
[1:14:08] a uh
[1:14:10] God in a a sinner
[1:14:15] it was when we was in God
[1:14:18] and then a part of God
[1:14:21] and the only part of God is the eternal
[1:14:23] life not people
[1:14:26] get this thing out of the way
[1:14:29] this is the garbage can we're trying to
[1:14:31] get redeemed
[1:14:34] well I just feel like I was back there
[1:14:35] brother Dale sometimes when you're
[1:14:37] preaching I just feel like I was back
[1:14:39] there
[1:14:40] I don't feel like I'm back there I know
[1:14:42] it was
[1:14:43] if I have eternal life today I know I
[1:14:45] was back there
[1:14:47] why because that's eternal life that I'm
[1:14:49] talking about not me
[1:14:51] not as a person
[1:14:54] you know what the prophet said your name
[1:14:56] was written there he said
[1:14:59] I'm paraphrasing the quote now because I
[1:15:01] have to get it
[1:15:01] he said not necessarily your name now
[1:15:10] your mind name may not be Donnie
[1:15:20] it may not be Anderson
[1:15:23] we have trouble with his anyway getting
[1:15:25] that maroon gone
[1:15:28] we don't make fun of people about their
[1:15:30] names
[1:15:31] it's just that we try to pronounce them
[1:15:33] sometimes we can't get it and I can't
[1:15:35] remember whether they're from Kenya or
[1:15:37] North Africa or South Africa or New
[1:15:39] Mexico I can't keep up with it I don't
[1:15:40] try to get that all in my mind I'm sorry
[1:15:45] I just try to be what I am
[1:15:49] but listen
[1:15:53] see the next message you'll see is we'll
[1:15:54] start coming back this way now
[1:15:58] I mean dropping it back into time
[1:16:00] because
[1:16:01] if you can see that before the world
[1:16:03] ever begun that you're a part of God
[1:16:06] you don't have no trouble with him
[1:16:08] predestinating
[1:16:11] but by foreknowledge he's got to get
[1:16:13] that flesh here
[1:16:17] you got a deal on four knowledge get
[1:16:18] that old flesh we're looking at
[1:16:21] don't deal with predestination about
[1:16:22] that old flesh
[1:16:24] deal before knowledge
[1:16:28] because how are you going to have in the
[1:16:29] morning start staying together and the
[1:16:30] sons of God shouted for joy
[1:16:34] you know one of the prophets said they'd
[1:16:36] done that
[1:16:37] he said because they seen the Plan of
[1:16:39] Redemption
[1:16:45] we way back there looking at the planet
[1:16:47] and how the Plan of Redemption didn't
[1:16:49] come into view until we start back this
[1:16:51] away
[1:16:53] you got to get Adam into the garden
[1:16:55] first
[1:16:56] and then you can talk about the Plan of
[1:16:58] Redemption because Adam in the garden
[1:17:02] didn't need Redemption
[1:17:07] right he wasn't a sinner
[1:17:09] he was perfect
[1:17:13] then you start dealing with
[1:17:15] those things
[1:17:16] let's stand together we got communion
[1:17:19] anybody has a need we just
[1:17:22] open up and say if you have a need just
[1:17:24] coming
[1:17:25] unless
[1:17:26] pray about it
[1:17:28] and believe it
[1:17:31] then we'll go into the communion
[1:17:40] anybody have a need before we go into
[1:17:42] communion
[1:17:52] with my children
[1:17:54] okay well let's believe that God will
[1:17:57] take care of it amen father we commit
[1:17:59] into your hands what our brother is
[1:18:01] talking about
[1:18:02] Lord Jesus
[1:18:05] he wants you to work out all of his
[1:18:07] problems so that's a good thing to do
[1:18:09] just take them give them to you Lord
[1:18:12] and father we love you didn't we We Just
[1:18:15] Praise Your Great Name
[1:18:17] we ask you now to bless our brother and
[1:18:19] just be with him and let everything work
[1:18:20] for your honor and Glory
[1:18:22] in Jesus name
[1:18:25] anybody else before we go into communion
[1:18:29] you know we'd just be like what the
[1:18:31] things that we've heard from the prophet
[1:18:33] are from the world and the people
[1:18:35] you know
[1:18:37] The Story Goes that there was a
[1:18:39] a man that he hired a bookkeeper you've
[1:18:43] heard the story to do all of his book
[1:18:45] work and handle everything and
[1:18:49] one day the guy came in and he said
[1:18:51] late in the evening he said
[1:18:53] your bankrupt said you're done you're
[1:18:55] broke you don't have any money
[1:18:57] everything's
[1:18:59] new and said what you're going to do he
[1:19:00] said I'm going to bed
[1:19:04] you're going to bed when I told you
[1:19:06] everything's messed up said yep that's
[1:19:08] what I hired you for
[1:19:11] yeah
[1:19:12] Corner way of saying it but you know we
[1:19:15] have a lot of problems and troubles and
[1:19:17] all that we just don't give them to God
[1:19:20] you know he's the problem solver
[1:19:24] we're the one who created them
[1:19:26] and we try to straighten them out we
[1:19:28] just keep creating them
[1:19:30] so the best thing to do just give them
[1:19:31] to him go to bed
[1:19:33] I tell you how I go to sleep at night we
[1:19:36] pray me and my wife we pray there in the
[1:19:38] bedroom you know and we get down and we
[1:19:40] pray and and then I just turn over to
[1:19:42] bed and I said well Lord I'm not going
[1:19:44] to do anything else this evening there's
[1:19:45] anything else you can make me think of
[1:19:47] and I need to go do I'll try to run do
[1:19:49] it in a hurry but if not I'll see you in
[1:19:51] the morning
[1:19:54] well well I said before the room gets
[1:19:57] dark I'm asleep
[1:19:59] well it's a good way
[1:20:02] you know when I can't sleep when I'm
[1:20:04] worried about my problems
[1:20:07] you want to try to tell her she gets
[1:20:09] worried about everything she builds a
[1:20:10] house she's got everything built in her
[1:20:11] mind before she ever even before we even
[1:20:13] bought the property
[1:20:17] I said honey that's not the way to do
[1:20:21] just lay down and say Lord when we get
[1:20:23] to our it'll take care of it
[1:20:26] until then you take care of it
[1:20:29] because I can't solve it
[1:20:31] you'll go to sleep a whole lot quicker
[1:20:34] than you will trying to figure
[1:20:35] everything out all right
[1:20:37] let's read our scripture and go into the
[1:20:39] communion
[1:20:41] First Corinthians 11 23 for I have
[1:20:44] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:20:46] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:20:47] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:20:49] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:20:52] he break it and said take eat
[1:20:54] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:20:56] that's doing remembrance of me after the
[1:20:59] same manner also we took the cup we need
[1:21:01] some saying this cup is the New
[1:21:03] Testament in my blood this new year as
[1:21:05] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:21:07] me where as often as you eat this bread
[1:21:10] and drink this cup you do shoot the
[1:21:11] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:21:13] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:21:16] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:21:18] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:21:20] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:21:22] him eating that bread and drink of that
[1:21:24] cup or he'd eat us and drinketh
[1:21:26] unworthily eateth and drink a damnation
[1:21:28] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:21:30] body now I remember one time brother
[1:21:34] Mulk said something about this and it
[1:21:35] really helped me
[1:21:37] he said you come in here and you're
[1:21:38] going to fix and take communion and say
[1:21:39] it here you know that uh let a man
[1:21:42] examine himself
[1:21:44] and they said let him eat
[1:21:46] my wife found something wrong
[1:21:49] examine yourself you find something
[1:21:51] wrong
[1:21:53] he said well the best way to describe
[1:21:54] that is brother Dale if I said something
[1:21:56] to you offensively you know and was
[1:21:58] wrong or something like that
[1:22:01] and said I come to the communion and
[1:22:02] I've got to cover up you said something
[1:22:04] wrong
[1:22:06] well see the devil will keep telling you
[1:22:07] don't take communion
[1:22:09] he said why not just say well okay Lord
[1:22:11] quickly because I get where I'm going
[1:22:12] I'll take care of that
[1:22:13] he said go and take the communion
[1:22:16] but just make sure you get right on the
[1:22:19] other
[1:22:21] because if you don't you're going to
[1:22:22] bring damnation on your own self
[1:22:27] I mean if you do something wrong you
[1:22:28] come up to the communion you think
[1:22:30] well hey wait a minute I said something
[1:22:32] to a guy down there at work
[1:22:34] well I can't go call him up right now
[1:22:38] so I'll just
[1:22:39] say Lord I'll take care of that in the
[1:22:41] morning
[1:22:42] just make sure that's the first thing
[1:22:44] you do
[1:22:45] see he covers it all right I love it for
[1:22:48] that
[1:22:51] for this caused many a weekend sickly
[1:22:53] among you in many sleep for we would
[1:22:55] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:22:56] but when we are judged we're chasing of
[1:22:58] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:23:00] with the world or for my brethren when
[1:23:02] you come together to eat Terry one for
[1:23:04] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:23:06] meet at home that you come not together
[1:23:08] under condemnation and the wrestle I
[1:23:11] said in order when I come
[1:23:14] let's just take a few moments of Silent
[1:23:16] prayer praying one for the other where
[1:23:19] the Lord would be with us and forgive us
[1:23:21] and make us worthy to take the communion
[1:23:23] and to make all things straight
[1:23:25] and right in our hearts and lives if we
[1:23:27] have anything now that needs to be made
[1:23:29] straight it needs to be taken care of
[1:23:31] you don't say well hey wait a minute let
[1:23:33] me get this out of the way
[1:23:35] and see then that way we just take a
[1:23:37] little time
[1:23:38] to pray just pray in one for another
[1:23:57] thank you
[1:23:58] just blessing God each and every one of
[1:24:01] us Lord make us worthy in you forgive
[1:24:03] our sins cleanse us and keep us in Jesus
[1:24:06] name
[1:24:10] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:24:12] it Lord Jesus we ask you this be with us
[1:24:15] as we now partake of this communion and
[1:24:18] we come to the place of breaking the
[1:24:20] bread because it was a symbol of your
[1:24:22] broken body for each one of us
[1:24:24] we know it's not the body it's just in a
[1:24:26] symbol
[1:24:27] you know but yet Lord how wonderful
[1:24:29] assembly is when we do what you say
[1:24:31] we love you and we thank you sanctify
[1:24:33] the bread and the partakers in Jesus
[1:24:35] name
[1:24:44] as I always tell you I think of the
[1:24:45] children of Israel
[1:24:48] when they were getting ready to leave
[1:24:49] out
[1:24:52] the last thing they done was
[1:24:55] at that lamb
[1:24:58] then they had a place in a park which
[1:25:01] in a form of the communion
[1:25:04] they took that and
[1:25:06] they were ready to leave
[1:25:09] I think we need to be about getting
[1:25:11] ready to leave out of here myself
[1:25:13] and you know I want to anyway
[1:25:16] but you know what I'm not too bad of
[1:25:19] shape I I'm kind of enjoying life myself
[1:25:22] I may have problems hurts and heartaches
[1:25:24] and troubles but you know what huh
[1:25:27] I'm still better than a lot of people
[1:25:29] a lot of people didn't get up this
[1:25:31] morning sister Johnny always says he
[1:25:34] says the Lord woke me up
[1:25:36] well you know not a clock did well he
[1:25:38] made the clock
[1:25:40] so you know
[1:25:43] he's helping us always if we just do
[1:25:45] that and realize it all would be well
[1:25:47] and different
[1:25:49] in what we're doing
[1:25:51] and we'd have a whole lot of a different
[1:25:53] life
[1:25:54] an attitude about things to just realize
[1:25:56] he's in command
[1:25:58] he's taking care of everything
[1:26:01] Lord Jesus we thank you for this wine
[1:26:03] just went through the process now
[1:26:05] we ask you to sanctify it's a symbol of
[1:26:07] thy blood that was shed for each one of
[1:26:09] us we ask you to sanctify the wine and
[1:26:12] the partakers that we may all be
[1:26:13] together as one in you and guide us now
[1:26:16] in Jesus name amen
[1:26:22] I know it was the blood
[1:26:25] I know it was a blood
[1:26:29] I know it was a blood
[1:26:32] for me
[1:26:35] one day when I was lost
[1:26:38] he died upon the cross
[1:26:42] and I know it was a blood oh
[1:26:48] I know it was a blood
[1:26:52] I know it was the blood
[1:26:55] I know it was communion is for everyone
[1:26:59] who has the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:02] when I was lost
[1:27:05] he died upon the cross
[1:27:08] and I know it was a blood for me
[1:27:14] I know it was Supply
[1:27:17] I
[1:27:18] I know it was the blood
[1:27:20] I know it was Sublime thought
[1:27:26] one day when I was lost
[1:27:30] he died upon the cross
[1:27:33] and I know it was the blood well whose
[1:27:38] blood was it it was Emmanuel's plan
[1:27:42] it was Emmanuel's mind
[1:27:46] it was Emmanuel's blood for me
[1:27:52] one day when I was lost
[1:27:55] he died up on the cross
[1:27:59] and I know it was a blood for me
[1:28:09] I know worship
[1:28:13] what a wonderful thing to be able to
[1:28:15] think about
[1:28:16] they were not tied up in things of
[1:28:18] believing this is a little robotic
[1:28:20] literal blood Etc
[1:28:22] we believe the truth
[1:28:24] it's in symbol form
[1:28:27] but yet said do this until
[1:28:30] I come
[1:28:32] so I'm in the message you stop taking
[1:28:34] communion because they believe the Lord
[1:28:35] Has Come
[1:28:37] that's their business that ain't nothing
[1:28:38] to you and I we'll take the communion
[1:28:40] here until the day comes that we're
[1:28:42] walking off this Earth
[1:28:44] because I don't believe that means you
[1:28:47] know until I come to work that I believe
[1:28:49] it means the last thing we're going to
[1:28:51] do and you know what we'll get over
[1:28:52] there the first thing we're going to do
[1:28:54] marriage supper is not going to be
[1:28:56] taters and beans
[1:28:59] it's going to be the communion
[1:29:03] so why not be with the lies I would love
[1:29:05] to be I wish it would fall that way that
[1:29:08] we would be taking communion and then we
[1:29:10] just go up
[1:29:11] and we just sat down at the table
[1:29:15] sit right down at the table
[1:29:18] and just take the communion
[1:29:22] it'd be a wonderful time wouldn't it
[1:29:28] let's all protect together
[1:29:41] you can be seated for a moment
[1:29:43] we're getting ready
[1:29:46] if you'd like to turn into scriptures in
[1:29:47] John the 13th chapter
[1:29:50] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:29:52] now put into the heart of Judas is
[1:29:54] Simon's son to betray him
[1:29:56] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:29:58] all things into his hands and he was
[1:29:59] come from God and went to God
[1:30:02] he rides from supper and laid aside his
[1:30:04] garments and took a towel and gurged
[1:30:06] himself
[1:30:07] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:30:09] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:30:11] wiped them with a towel wherewith he was
[1:30:12] girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[1:30:15] Peter saith unto him Lord just thou wash
[1:30:17] my feet
[1:30:18] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[1:30:20] do that I know it's not now but Thou
[1:30:22] shalt know hereafter
[1:30:24] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[1:30:26] wash my feet Jesus answered him if I
[1:30:28] washed thee not thou has no part with me
[1:30:31] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my
[1:30:34] feet only but also my hands in my head
[1:30:37] Jesus saith unto him he that is worse
[1:30:39] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[1:30:42] is clean every wit and you're clean but
[1:30:44] not all for he knew who should betray
[1:30:46] him therefore said he you are not all
[1:30:48] clean so after he had washed her feet
[1:30:51] and taken his garments and was set down
[1:30:53] again he said unto them know you what I
[1:30:55] have done to you
[1:30:56] you call me mastering Lord and you say
[1:30:58] well for so I am if I then your Lord and
[1:31:01] Master have washed your feet you also
[1:31:03] want to wash one another's feet for I've
[1:31:05] given you an example that you should do
[1:31:08] as I have done to you verily verily I
[1:31:10] say unto you the servant is not greater
[1:31:12] than his Lord neither he that is sent
[1:31:15] greater than he that sent him if you
[1:31:17] know these things happy are ye
[1:31:20] if you do them
[1:31:22] let's Stand Together be dismissed
[1:31:25] I was reading something in the paper the
[1:31:27] other day and I was thinking
[1:31:29] you know in some of the countries like
[1:31:30] brotherification lives in
[1:31:33] you know they can be put in jail for
[1:31:35] trying to convert
[1:31:36] someone from one belief to another
[1:31:40] you know it was in the paper the other
[1:31:43] day I meant to cut it out
[1:31:46] they're making it to her
[1:31:49] that it'll be against the law
[1:31:53] for you to try to convert
[1:31:56] a person from being a
[1:31:58] homosexual
[1:32:06] they're making that law
[1:32:08] they're taking
[1:32:10] actually be against you said no school
[1:32:12] no place no nothing
[1:32:15] has a right to try to tell somebody
[1:32:19] for thought to be what they want to be
[1:32:25] you think we're immune to these things
[1:32:27] no
[1:32:29] we're sitting right in the middle of
[1:32:30] them
[1:32:32] who's worried about it it even mentioned
[1:32:34] in our clergy and stuff like that trying
[1:32:36] to change someone's thinking
[1:32:40] that they have a right to think what
[1:32:41] they want
[1:32:43] the Bible don't give you a right to
[1:32:44] think what you want
[1:32:47] we are the children of God we have no
[1:32:49] right to think we follow what he says
[1:32:53] right but you see they're going to crack
[1:32:55] down and do what they want to
[1:32:58] because they're the law
[1:33:00] well
[1:33:01] so that means we've got to be here close
[1:33:03] to the end time if things are going to
[1:33:04] start taking place and praise God bring
[1:33:07] it on let's get under this you know do
[1:33:09] whatever Prophet said Church done better
[1:33:11] under persecution
[1:33:13] yeah I certainly don't want it
[1:33:16] but that's what he said
[1:33:20] let's think about these things father as
[1:33:21] we go now to have the foot washing we
[1:33:23] pray that you'd bless each and every one
[1:33:25] of us and guide us and be with everybody
[1:33:27] on the way home
[1:33:29] give a safe journey let everything be
[1:33:31] all right for you Lord we love you and
[1:33:33] we thank you we pray what we said today
[1:33:35] has been
[1:33:36] Lord worthy of being said because I
[1:33:39] tried
[1:33:40] but I know when doing the best I can do
[1:33:41] I still fail in words and terminologies
[1:33:44] and things that
[1:33:45] are not right according even to the
[1:33:47] human language because I just got my own
[1:33:49] words
[1:33:50] but I pray Lord that you'd help and
[1:33:51] guide each one of us and take care of us
[1:33:53] and give us of your loving grace in
[1:33:56] Jesus name
[1:33:57] you dismissed
