========================================

want to see you i want to see you open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] you are holy [Music] amen i know that's your desire this evening to see him it's good to be in the house of the lord this evening i'm going to uh just minister from a little subject um from mark chapter 11 to knife we'll go ahead and turn there and as everybody's taking their seat and uh take a little y'all got a little spoiler sunday evening but i'm gonna be preaching on uh getting into position for perfect faith from the from the from the message that brother graham preached uh perfect faith um sometimes when i when i'm you know when i'm reading what brother graham said little little things that he says and a message will pop out and so just kind of want to call out getting into position for perfect faith let's go to the lord in prayer before we go to the word lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together and look into your word lord and we know that the scripture says when a man finds a pearl of great price he just sells everything so he can get it and lord we know lord that your word is like it's like a great big field that we go treasure hunting in lord and tonight lord i want to go through your word and find these little treasures lord jesus that will give your people edification and strength lord jesus it'll help somebody along life's road and maybe there's somebody this evening lord is battling something and going through something in life and i pray god that tonight you'll give them something from your great treasure box pull something out lol god that lord they might be able to be equipped with lord we ask your blessing upon the reading of this word lord tonight and your ask your blessing upon this service lord that you'll come and be welcome here among us lord jesus lord god you've given us the power of your word lord give us the strength of your spirit lord to come and quicken it lord and make it alive to us it'll come and live in our hearts lord we ask and pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen so getting into position for perfect faith now uh this is this is uh one of those you know kind of perplexing scriptures even brother branham when he would read he talked about he would read this talking about coming to a place where you could speak and all these kind of things he would he would say it for a while it stumbled and everything but let's read it and see what it says mark chapter 11 verse 22 27 and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says now think about that that if you if you come to a place where there's no doubt that all the doubts are moved and you you come into a position for perfect faith you can say to this mountain be thou removed and be cast into the sea and it will happen therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them right now there's another just see jesus is telling his disciples he's setting them up for a position to have faith to believe and he's telling now listen when you pray don't come groveling and everything but come confidently and boldly believing that the things that you're asking for that you already receive them amen and i love this is one of our favorite verses we need because you know a lot of times when you pray you'll get in your mind that you're supposed to you know hold your hands a certain way or or kind of uh lay on the floor or get on your knees or whatever now but this jesus says when when ye stand pray and you know what the scripture also says when you've done all you can do stan and he's talking about he's talking about here somebody that's coming confidently not groveling and all those kind of things but somebody's standing on what they believe when you stand praying forgive oh my amen if you have all against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now there's a lot packed into that scripture let's see if we'll unpack what we can unpack and find in the in the treasure hunt tonight and uh i don't have too many quotes so we'll maybe we won't hold you too long tonight but kind of start off on this you know brother browning when he was preaching this sermon he you right after right as you're reading this scripture he's he's talking about jesus is setting everybody in position for faith and and lays down to stand praying and have confidence in all these things that we just read and then he kind of throws that right there in the middle you got to forgive forgive now now you think about that when you come when you're when you're down there in your prayer closet or riding in your car or whatever and you begin to tell god that you believe his word and make your confession boldly and all those things and then there's a little hiccup there's something that you got against somebody and you see god to have to come to a position of faith of perfect faith where all doubt is gone there's nothing in the way you got to get rid of all of the things that you've got against other people and see yeah i remember last time i was preaching i kind of got on uh offenses and things like that but see what think what builds up in people was when you get around one another offenses begin to build up and you begin to build up complexes against one another you begin to think that somebody's got something against you and it becomes a blocker and you'll never be able to move past that you'll never be able to move beyond that if you can't forgive one another so forgiveness from god is actually predicated on you forgiving one another if you can't forgive your brother who have you seen how is god how do you expect god to forgive you how do you expect god to forgive you of the great big mountain of things when you can't forgive somebody of just a a a little smaller i was kind of contemplating the other day about how we get so tore up with little small things when there was stephen with getting rocks hurled up against his head getting his skull cracked and and all those things and we we account many times a little small things as something big we got to lay those those those those things aside if we want to have get come to a position of perfect faith brother brother bob that was an unpleasant way to start this sermon i wish you would get off of those kind of meddling kind of things but you see that these things are necessary to bring us to a place where we can have confidence before god because god wants you to come to a place where you can have confidence where you can approach him boldly with confidence now think if you could think if you could just if you're not at that place yet if you could imagine what it would be like to be able to get on your knees and approach god confidently knowing that there's nothing that you have against anybody else that your slate is clean that you don't have anything against anybody else that you've maybe even the ones that you think have something against you you've gone to them and you've straightened it all out and everything's laid bare and then you see then you can have confidence to come before before god boldly professing and confessing that what you believe his word that you that you know he is the god that he is your god the god that you serve and you can come boldly professing you can stand like jesus said stand upon his word stand confidently on what you know to be right you see sometimes we got we just got forgive means to just let go and sometimes we gotta just let stuff go even you know many times we quote the lord's prayer luke chapter 11 and and i think one of the other gospels is really where it's laid out more plainly but in luke chapter 11 it says give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone everyone that is indebted to us my that's a that's that seems like it's asking a lot but if you can forgive everyone that is indebted to you it will free things up so that you can come with confidence it'll free you it lifts it lifts that burden off of you and god wants you to be free of all the burden you know that's one of the promises that we get we have access to in the message is freedom that when you receive the word and you're able to just let stuff go and come to god boldly it gives you freedom freedom is one of the benefits of the message of serving god freedom and liberty to serve him freedom to be able to just to grab a hold of his promises and say i believe it and there's nothing that's holding me back freedom to let other things let things go all these ways that so easily be beset us now now let's get into the topic here what is faith now brother braham said you cannot be saved without faith and and he talked about how faith actually declares or it speaks for itself now think about that that faith when you've got faith faith is the thing that does the speaking on its own behalf faith is this thing that that declares whether it's actually there or not and that now now let's let's kind of get down to the we'll say the nitty-gritty get down to the where the rubber meets the road because the devil the devil will sit maybe the devil's sitting here right here in this sermon he pro he probably is sitting there right there right here in the pews next to you listening and the devil believes and trembles the bible says the devil will listen and he acknowledges that that god is god there's no other god beside him he acknowledges that all these things are are you know technically true and so of course the the devil believes but what's the difference between the devil's belief and in your believing now the devil can look at the scripture and say well that's true that's sure sure but now when you grab ahold of the word of god by faith and believe it in your heart and you say that's true something something takes place what takes place it actually becomes a life it actually lives so there you can see that the difference is faith makes the word live faith actually produces a living word a living reality it will make the things that you read about and it'll turn it from just like an education an intellectual faith it'll turn it into a living word a living reality and that's why it declares or it speaks for itself because when it becomes alive then it becomes it is testifying of itself it testifies it's bold brother i'm saying faith is something that you believe is there that really nothing else will declare it's there but faith nothing else will declare us there but faith and then he goes on to talk about how faith won't work without love and that's where you know brother brother wade has been preaching on perfect love and and we've been talking about adoption and those kind of things and you see how love and faith are so closely related that you've got to actually have love to have real faith and brother brown says brother brown says explain he began to explain in this message he was talking about how this couple when they first got married he uh they were just a young couple in the and the and the man in the story had uh he had a history of alcohol problem and when they got married the the little sister she said now listen i know that you had a a background of alcoholism but now listen i love you and if you if you ever stray if you ever go have a trouble with that and go back out into alcoholism and and go and and kind of mess up you know when i'm not around you go to work and i start hanging out with some people or whatever if you ever fall just remember that i love you i i love you and when you come back we'll get together and we'll pray about it we'll bring this situation before god and we'll get together and we'll iron this thing out now now think about this that's a lot contrary to the way a lot of people do in the message a way a lot of people approach their marriages and things it's not with love and not with confidence but with bashing one another over the head until i tell you drive one another into submission most of the most of the time we approach situations like that or people you see that if you if you mess up when you get home i'm gonna drag you in front of the church and you're gonna confess i'm going to drag you over this way and that way i'm going to knock you out or whatever but you see love love is actually you've got to have love to have confidence and see that brother when he went to work he told all of his all the people that he was working with he said how could i do anything to to go against the confidence that she has in me i know she loves me with a love like that how could i do anything that's the kind of love that produces faith and you see when you've got that kind of love to god then you can come boldly before him with confidence that's the kind of love that will produce a perfect faith when you come before him and you can say that i know that you saved me and i know you brought me out of sin and i know that you would not have died on the cross if you didn't love me and i know that the reason that you set the fivefold ministry is because you love me and i know all of these things and the love has been built up until you've got an actual love relationship going on and you have confidence because you know that you love god and you know that he loves you and it's a relationship you see that's what god wants you to have a relationship with him he doesn't want you to have a relationship built on fear and wondering if he's gonna just uh have something horrible to you if you slip up or if you mess up he wants you to love him that's the kind of relationship he wants you to have you see brother brown said brother brown said faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyway see it masters all circumstances and faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together and so then you can see that if you love god then everything will begin to work out every you begin to come to church you begin to do the things that you're a christian does because it's not because that you've been you it's because that you love god your brother said and if you love the lord just not trying to dodge hell not just trying to dodge hell but you love the lord then you have faith in god see if you love him if you love him really from that agapo love that brother wade's been bringing out agapo love that kind of love the selfless love that's willing to lay everything out you know in the beginning of this message brother ram talks about how faith really really true faith does for other people you're not so interested in them doing for you but it's something for other people and that's what real agapo love is doing el gapo love will make a minister labor for hours to try to get a message not even concerned about how much money or how much fame or what any of that kind of stuff all of that becomes irrelevant love will make people labor for one another love will make people do for one another love will make you go to the hospital and be with people love will make you get off work or whatever to help people love will make you talk to your wife or your spouse differently it'll make you lay down your selfish attitude and stuff and treat somebody differently because that's that's what agapo love is not filial love not stargate love and not definitely not eros love but a love of god that proceeds from god himself that kind of substance faith that we're talking about yeah brother brown said now now now think about this now we think about it in the context of the sermons that have been preached talking about adoption talking about it coming to a place talking about uh perfect love brother john said now now he preached this sermon in front of a prayer line and at the end of this sermon he said y'all this didn't anchor in i don't think it's anchoring in what i'm really trying to express so i want to kind of expose that tonight i want what he was trying to say to anchor in i want you to catch the vision of what he was trying to say that they did not catch back then and brother brown said now we want to speak now upon faith and a different type of faith a different type of faith perfect faith and he said that's a great thing now maybe maybe later on you can go back and listen to this message it's only just a little bit over an hour so it won't take that long go back and listen and meditate on these things that he says as he says it like this now we want to speak now upon faith in a different type of faith a different type of faith and he says we're i'm trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us now what's it going to take to see apostolic times moving among among the church it's going to take a malachi 4 to actually literally turn the hearts of the children back to the original faith of the fathers actually restore them back to open up to preach the revelation of the seven seals and those mystery truths would literally turn your heart back and cause you to come to a position of perfect faith realizing what you're doing and whom you have believed and positionally placed you so that you can believe the right way now brother branham said listen now he says that he says and it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we see it but we want to see more of it we want it such a flow that it'll be a help to us to flow out to others to flow out to others what about the flow flow back to me to flow out to others because real faith goes out to others you see real faith is where you can help others and do something for others and do something for the kingdom of god and do something for god you see see what stumbles people is that when you say perfect faith you begin in your mind you begin to think well i can never i could never approach to perfection i could never approach to this kind of faith the same thing with the capstone the same thing with the token all these things these great doctrines it seems like so so far off i want to get it down to your level a little bit that it is possible and that is actually the reason why the message was given so that you could have perfect faith the reason why the message was given so that so the little child could have perfect faith i was thinking this morning about about peter that a man sitting there with with no education that could not read or write maybe he could a little bit he couldn't he couldn't read and yet he preached he talked about the stature of a perfect man now see see it's open to anybody that can receive if you'll just open up the door of your heart and let the word come in the word will actually position you position you and place you in a way that you can begin to take hold of god's word and recognize what you're doing here recognize what has got what god has done in your life and you can actually believe in the way that god wants you to believe in the way that the word actually begins to come out of your own mouth and you begin to speak the things that are in the scripture so that when you pray you're not praying like a little baby anymore but you're praying standing in faith believing in the god that you serve that he's he loves you and he's there for you and he's watching over you he's watched over you your whole life and he's there to make his word come to pass in you now now now let's just go through perfection just briefly let's read some scriptures now in hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 to 2 it says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection to perfection perfection now not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god or the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment all of those things are good and we know we've been taught that we go beyond we've got to keep going on like where where did pentecost fail by stopping you don't go you don't stop you keep moving on because we're moving on towards something in second corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 paul said for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection not that you would be little babies tossed around around by every window doctrine but that you would be perfected in luke chapter eight now here's a very strange one maybe we hadn't come across before here's a real strange one and this is the parable of the see the sower of the seed i'm gonna read it for you and just call out some things because jesus said now the parable is this the seed is the word of god we know the parable about how the the the sower goes forth and and a lot of the seed gets choked out and different kind of things things happen so it can't grow and and jesus is explaining it and he says those by the wayside are they to hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root for which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life that kind of sounds like layout of sea a little bit doesn't it joked up with the cares and the riches of the pleasure this is life too much time to watch netflix and too much time to get on instagram than to actually get into the message and bring no fruit to perfection to perfection but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience bring forth fruit so when you see the fruit being born and it matches the same thing that went into the ground then you've got perfection back again i'm just kind of laying this out brother brahma said in perfect faith in this message he says now you see somebody else do something by a word act of god or promise of god and many of them say i can do that too now i'm tying this in with a scripture that i just read about the fruit not coming to perfection now listen what he says i can do that too it's an imagination and when they do you find them wrecked up out there somewhere it's got to be a substance now that is potentially a faith that is something that would bring you to a faith it's potentially like if you'd asked me for an oak tree and i give you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree but it hasn't produced itself yet but when it really brings itself out it is an oak tree and when you imagine that god does this but when it's revealed to you it's a faith then a perfect faith that cannot fail and i believe that brother branham preaches in different levels now one hand he's saying yeah you you start off at justification but wait till it comes out of the ground wait till it comes on out then you got perfect faith there in your soul but what about what about after you've been born again then let that let what has been planted continue to mature as the word has matured down through martin luther and john wesley and pentecost and now is coming out coming out to the headstone coming out to a place where now you can see the original fruit that was planted the original grain of wheat coming forth so what is perfection what perfection are we talking about we're talking about a perfect faith a mature faith a fruitful faith of faith where there's no leaven anymore no leaven nothing mixed in it no hybridization no doubt no it's back to the original again because brother branham said that you got to have perfect faith for a rapture in this message he said perfect faith came for for a perfect rapture perfect faith now think about that perfect faith a perfect faith is given to a perfect bride to take a perfect rapture see how perfect that is you've heard a perfect message and that perfect message was given so that you could have a perfect faith you see it's something that you have something that you've already got when you became a born-again believer growing into manifestation growing into reality and that's why sometimes it's so confusing to listen to the way that he's wording it because it seems like you've got it and then it's far off it seems like when you listen to the statue of a perfect man you've got it you've got you're born again but yet you've come all this way and you don't have the holy ghost yet you've got it but there's something else you got it but it's growing in the maturity and when it grows into maturity then you come to a place where it's mature and there's no doubt and you come to speaking conditions the gospel message the message is actually getting us in position for perfect faith and you know i think this is i i know many times many preachers have preached on how we we keep pushing it off and pushing it off but now i believe it's time to get into the message and realize that it's a present tense reality that the things that brother branham talked about now are accessible to you and i the things that so many people have probed now are like he said it's right at the door it's right at the door if you can just just take some time and get in there and hunt for the treasure hunt for the little bits of gold and the nuggets and and when you come out you'll say this is something that i found that will give me faith this is the thing that i needed to overcome what i'm going through this is the thing that i needed to take me to the next level that's what the message is doing to you now brother brown said in the message adoption back in 1960 he said now listen how he says talks about positionally positionally placing you bible teaching is usually a little treacherous a little you know kind of walking out on the thin ice we call it but we just feel that maybe at this point and at this time it might be good to kind of bring the church to what i think a complete understanding positionally of what we are in christ jesus now as we as we'll go along in this message you'll begin to understand why it's so important for you to begin to realize who you are because who you are and who god is and the relationship the love relationship that you have because that is actually what positionally brings you to a place of perfect faith is knowing who you are what i think a complete understanding positionally of what we are in christ jesus and sometimes i think that preaching is a wonderful thing but i believe sometimes brother beeler that teaching goes beyond that especially to the church preaching usually catches the sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places of man positionally what he is and see that's how you're going to have perfect faith is by understanding through the teaching through the preaching of the word what you are and we can now listen i got this bold and real big in my notes here we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are so if you want to have perfect faith this kind of mature faith that i'm talking about you've got to know who you are and you've got to understand who you are you've got to believe who you are of course that only comes by getting in the word now brother branham he began to talk about how faith faith versus science faith faith does not care about what you see it does not care about circumstances faith faith just looks to the unseen faith sees what the senses cannot brethren says now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is and it's impossible to please god without faith you cannot please him and if you say you believe god you have never seen him see so then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith anything that the census declares is no more faith it's a scientific fact now you say you might begin to think well i wish that i could see him i wish that i could see him right here but your faith is so much higher than your your natural senses that when you see him by faith it's greater than if you could see him sitting there in the chair sitting there in a pew because if you see him with the inward eye then you it's actually him inside of you that allows you to see and it's greater than that because on the inside you're not looking at things that you see anymore you're looking like peter when jesus called in to walk on the water and he stepped out on something that he could not see and he ignored all the things that he could see like abraham who ignored the circumstances to ignore how old he was and instead of looking at how old he was in the circumstances looked straight into the face of god's promises and claimed it anything that the census declares is no more faith it's a scientific fact it's got no more faith so faith faith is only concerned with looking at god's word but said you have to accept him by faith and he that cometh to god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word of god see you must first believe this is god's word and you must come to god by the word see just take the word what it says and that's right now see we're coming to a place he's establishing what it takes to have perfect faith when you can look at god's word and accept it and say i believe that that's true i know that it's true i know that i believe that then it begins to build your faith actually when you begin to sit in a cir in a service like this and his service actually as the preaching of the gospel goes over the pulpit your faith begins to rise if you really open the door of your heart and you listen and through the service your faith is building and building and building just like it was in this service as brother branham preached he said i'm trying to build your faith and at the end of the service they had a prayer line why at the end of the service and not the beginning because as they had heard the word their faith was built and built to a place until they began to believe god and brother i said you must come with an unfailing faith believing that god made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that faith you got to be in a position to have that faith that's what the word does is it places you it puts you right there in that position where you can grab a hold to it and that's why brother brown said and that's what we're going to talk on see to receive that faith and then he goes on he talks about how in hebrews 11. it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for it's not what you imagine not something that you can just you you're just hoping for or something it's just as real to you as any sense of your body will declare anything else it's just as real as to say i feel my coat it's just as real as i hear that baby talking and i'm talking about faith now i'm talking about when you get a real revelation and you know that god has opened your eyes on the inside open up your faith eye then you it's as real to you as this pulpit it's as real as the carpet it's as real as the pew you're standing on and brother adam said if you've got real faith and you go to the doctor and he says you've got cancer you'll laugh at the doctor because you've got something that's greater than anything that the doctor can say it's just as real as i hear that baby talking there or making this noise see just that real is music playing it's real because it's based upon something real not based upon the sinking sands of man's theology or a man's imagination or something maybe some kind of supernatural thing that maybe god allowed you to see at one time but it's based upon the rock of the revelation of god's word the revelation of who he is it's not upon what you can or can't can or cannot see or feel like i like somebody we were talking to some young people one time and somebody said well i you know i don't believe that a minister has a right to get up and preach behind the pulpit unless he sees something supernatural first now see then you got to go back and compare it with the word what's greater to be able to see the pillar of fire or something or to see an angel walk down the aisle or to actually have a revelation of god's word a revelation that gives you that kind of substance faith that you know what you're standing on and see then your house is not like that parable that jesus taught then your house is not built upon a sinking sand now i hate to say it but that's what many people today have done is they've allowed their their spiritual condition to be built upon a sinking sand of creeds or ideas or just their their laziness that they never went on with the gospel and they never went on they never were encouraged enough within themself to go and find out what the message was about and then they find out that they built everything on a sinking sand that crumbles at the end of the road but brother brown said that if you built if your revelation if your spiritual experience is built upon the rock of revelation it will never fail it can never be taken away from you and it's built what's perfect faith based on if faith is based upon god's word amen now y'all hang on with me i know some some of y'all i know y'all are like this is this is real basic why is he covering all this come on now we're we're getting somewhere y'all ain't intimidating me [Laughter] your faith your faith is in god's word brother brahma said it's a substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of god the word of god and that only that only now now that means that means that you're not saved because of a certain minister you're not saved because of a certain man or even the certain church that you go to because those things could be taken away all that could be taken away but if you're if you're if you know and you recognize that you're saved the reason that you're here tonight is because god has done something in your life you'll never be able to remove that brother brahman said that puts it back to where your faith in is not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in an organization it's not in a group of people it's in god because god is the word see your faith is in god so then you know when you get you get to a desperate place and you begin to call out to god and you have a love relationship with god that agapo love the deep calling to the deep then see if you're if your faith is based in your faith with god then you don't have to go call somebody else and wait for somebody else to do something you don't have to you're not relying on somebody else's relationship with god because you yourself have a personal relationship with god for yourself and you can stand and pray for yourself i i believe that's what every god called minister wants for the congregation of the lord it's for everybody to have their own relationship with god and if it's not if it's not some individual if it's not some man then that includes you you see because you're not saved because something that you did you're not saved because of your works peter peter one time he thought well i'm i'm real good i i i'm never gonna leave you lord i'm never i'm in matthew 26 it says though all men should be offended because of the yet well i never be offended and he thought he was going to be saved because of how much he could just just work up the gumption or work up the courage or whatever he thought he was going to be able to save himself jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the crew thou shalt deny me thrice psalm 100 says know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we're not the ones that has done it he's the and now and y'all bear with me now i i'm getting to something that that if we have confidence that he is the one that has transformed us that we didn't stop smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol or all of the things that we can look back and see that we used to do we didn't come out of those strange doctrines because of our own power but it's actually the lord that has moved us the lord has brought us to this place he's the one that has carried us this far and you see that that actually positions you to where you can have perfect faith to look at your own life and recognize that god has done something in you that god's done something for you and it's not something that you can point at a man or an organization or something that god has done it in zechariah chapter 4 it says the word of the lord is a ruble not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts it's not by your doings it's not by your power or you're working something up but it's by his spirit that has brought you this far his spirit is the thing that is working and doing it in you and that's the way that the headstone is going to come not by your struggling and striving it although that's part of it but it's his grace that's going to come to the church it's grace grace and she shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shout is crying grace grace unto it it's his grace to you that's brought it so then you can say we're going to say goodbye to all the complexes that have come by looking at man and looking at yourself goodbye all the things that where you say well i'm not smart enough that i'm not good enough and i'm not smart enough he's the one that made the way he's the one that's died on the cross so that you could come to him [Applause] you say i'm not pretty enough girls and i'm not a smart enough guys and i'm not strong enough i'm not this enough he's the word says that we are more than conquerors through him that loved us so when you begin to look back at his word instead of a man instead of your own self instead of an organization then you can begin to have perfect faith many times we look at our own lives and look back at the things we used to do and say well i i've got all these transgressions how can i ever pay for it i'll never be able to pay for my transgressions but his word says that it's already paid for it's already paid for and so perfect faith looks to him it looks to the things that you cannot see it looks to the it looks to what god has already accomplished in his word brother brown said i love this quote in 1954 he said therefore jesus didn't make a mistake when he said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect and how could a human being be perfect how can you be perfect in your own self i hope we just squash that it's not in your own self how could a human being be perfect he could be perfect by his perfect faith resting in him saying he paid the price for me and that's how you could be perfect by perfect faith in him perfect faith in that perfect one and brother said and he promised it and his word and here he comes and promised it for this day therefore you know where you're standing when he said so see there you enter into a position you're entering into a position for perfect faith when you can look at god's word and know that he said so he said see that gives me a faith because he never does nothing contrary to his written word and if it was contrary to the word i couldn't have faith in it brings it right back again to the word see faith in hearing the word of god you must hear the word of god god's word is that all-sufficient word it's all you have need of is this word and see now now you're coming when you've heard the word and it's built up within you and it's built up now you're coming into position for a perfect faith and brother abraham said i want you to get this now the church has got to lift itself in the power of god the church has got to lift itself in the power of god he said how we are too close to the end now and i believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make-believe out and get into something real get into something real where you begin to realize that jesus was right when he said that all things all things are possible to them that believe all things means all things that means that your family can be saved that means that that disease that you've been struggling with all these years that it's not too late the devil might be telling you that you've been suffering with that too long but all things are possible to them that believe all things and and it's true where jesus said in matthew 21 verily i say unto you if you have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done if you believe that all things are possible then that's possible too if you believe the word and the word is in you and you've been identified with the word then you have a right to speak the word you can speak the word and you have that privilege you have that privilege because the veil of the shook has been pulled back from your eyes and now you're coming to a position of faith where you know what you have access to when the shock is over your eyes you don't know what you have access to but when it's pulled back then you can see clearly you can see what you've got access to because now the grain is made bare you can see your eyes that's why brother brown told that story about his mama would rub that kungry saw over him the kung grease is the message of the hour that has been applied to our eyes to take away that shook veil and reveal to us the promises of god that we have access to the promises like all things are possible to them that believe and we are believers are we not we believe in the good times we believe in the bad times we believe when things are going right we believe because we are believers we believe in god we believe we know what we believe in now brother brown said in spiritual food and due season he said i want you i want you to get built up now i want you to get built up in the holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour what's the faith of this hour a perfect faith a perfect faith where you know that all things are possible the the faith it's going to take more faith than ever was at any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up that's why i believe the message of the hour is building up your faith it's building up not tearing down maybe there was a time long ago when it was time to tear people down but now the message is building people up it's building you up so that you begin to realize who you are built up like like who built up like how zerubbabel cleaned off the foundation and began to build up the tabernacle build it up so that when it was built up again the presence of god could come in and build up like elijah when he cleared off the stones and he began to peel up the stones like brother wade was preaching on last sunday and when he build it up they he stood with confidence and began to call on the name of the lord and identified who who they were not jacob but israel he said you're the god of israel he knew who he was he identified the church with the god that they served this is israel and he and then the fire field when he built up what had been torn down and brought everything back again to the way that it should be then then you see then they were positioned for perfect faith and that's what called the fire to fall you see you need you need the word you got to have the word the word's got to be built up in you to have perfect faith and you need the holy ghost to have perfect faith you've got to have the holy ghost now brother said now see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they had christ walking with him but then afterwards christ was in them so you see it's hard then to have this perfect faith without the holy spirit it has to bring it the holy spirit is what brings perfect faith now you say the disciples didn't have perfect faith no for they had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out of him and they couldn't do it they couldn't do it by their worked up intellectualism but when perfect faith entered in on the day of pentecost then they were able to do to do the things that jesus told them that they could do oh my let me see where see they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them i give you power you see you see how he's identifying power with the word amen i give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them see what i mean but jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen he had faith that what he said would happen so y'all hang on with me now we're we're just at the top of the hour he had faith now they see g brother is laying down something jesus had faith in who he was he had faith in the word and who he was now you see how how brother brown's building up your perfect faith that when you begin to recognize the word you know the word then then you begin to recognize that the word has had an effect on you it's accomplished something in your life and you begin to recognize something taking place in you and your eyes begin to open up to what you are then you begin to have perfect faith when you begin to see who you are brother said he had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing in myself he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word in other words i know that god has made me something i know that i'm here for a purpose i'm here to die for your sins and that's why he said i can do nothing in myself now you you've got that same confession here tonight i can do nothing in myself in my flesh in this tabernacle that i may have there's no way that i can wrap i can i can accomplish anything in myself but god has it by the power of the holy ghost he's done something in my life he's changed me he's molding me in his image and now you see you begin to recognize what he has done that it that's him working something in you it begins to build up a faith in you that's why you know jesus he began to he would identify himself in the scripture that's how we know that he had perfect faith jesus said in john chapter 8 he said then jesus said unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall know you know then shall you know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things in other words i got the word inside of me and i'm able to speak it because of who i am now come on let's put that in a presentation reality let's put that in the present tense and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him come on now let's bring it to a present tense reality somebody bride that's coming to a perfect faith that everything you do is pleasing to the father all the doubt is being cast out you're coming to a position where you know who you are just like jesus knew who he was in john chapter 12 it says for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment he gave you a commandment too he gave you a commission to speak and go forward he gave you a word to fulfill in this day do you believe that there's a purpose for you to do just like jesus had a purpose what i should say and what i should speak and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak even as the father even as it has been revealed to me then i i speak it that's i i i speak according to my revelation is what he's saying in isaiah chapter 2 61 he's saying the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath this is the scripture that jesus when he went there in the in the temple and he opened up the scroll and began to read identifying himself with the scripture because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings under the meketh sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are brown to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord he's identifying himself in the scripture how do you identify yourself with the scripture when you read the story of abraham i go i'm going through the same journey when you read the story of rahab i also was protected by the blood i'm protected i'm under the blood covenant when you read the story of david you can pray like david david went through the same three journeys that abraham went through when you read through all these stories in the old testament you're reading about yourself because you see people going through the same thing that you went through you're identified with him and it identifies you with the word because when you listen to the message when you listen to the tapes it echoes back that i know that i've gone through that same thing that brother branham's talking about i know that i've been there i know that i was there brother branham said and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and they was in him and that gave him faith because he understood his position he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this he knew what he was now do you see the importance of the opening of the seven seals because the seven seals actually identifies to you who you are it gives you confidence and positions you where you're supposed to be because when the seals open up you can look back at your life journey and know where you came from you can look back at your roadmap and know what god has done to you the shields open up and thundering out thundering out not just like something that is impossible to understand but thundering out lived voices a life lived by the word is the word express and that will give you that will position you for perfect faith now you know the dilemma with preaching like this recognizing who you are is because hold on now hold on you got to be humble hold on now that was that seems like a paradox that seems like a paradox when you begin to talk about that uh and i know that stumbles a lot of the young people here and everything how can how can you all be preaching that the son of man is is here and how can you be preaching that we're god in flesh and all these kind of things how can you trip now don't trip don't trip but go back to the word and see what the word says don't don't get stumbled all the way i'm telling you something now if this is true it's a matter of life and death so don't get stumbled over oh don't don't get stumbled up by deep teaching but go back and find out whether it's true or not somewhere along the way there's got to be a fulfillment of malachi 4 5 6 and revelation 10 7 and all the other scriptures that speak of this age that we're living in about what happens in laodicea and all the difference here there's got to be a fulfillment of that otherwise you gotta there's there's got to be there's got to be there's got to be a seventh church age messenger there's got to be it it it's true now now go back and do like the brains and search it out that's all i say about that now brother ryan said in the unconditional covenant you can never make yourself something that you're not if you're just impersonating christianity no matter if you're preaching the gospel you need an altar call in your soul you're just you're just impersonating if you're just trying to act like that person that's a christian you're miserable yourself knowing in your heart that you're not right you just feared hell and started off trying to be a christian god has to call you to be a christian god called abraham amen so it's god that that it in luke chapter 14 and verse 11 it says for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that umbleth himself shall be exhausted in first peter 5 5-6 it says likewise you younger submit yourselves younger under the elder the whole the whole christian experience is about submission and and brother we talked so many times about the way up is down if you want to go up get down see how low you can get not not how exalted you can get not where you can place yourself at the feet the first place of the feast but see how see how low you can get because god is the one that does the promoting god is the one that promote and what's he looking to promote he's looking to promote character and you cannot promote yourself many times we want to promote our family and ourselves we want to promote our kids and get our kids up there and promote them imagine if that was how uh the fivefold ministry was called the five full ministry was called by i want to do it but you see god is the one that promotes by character he's looking for character the same way that he chose david he chose david because of what he saw in his heart and he put him up there as king god is the one that promotes and so you can't you can't get high by promoting yourself you've got to let god do the promoting you can't elevate yourself you can't put yourself up there like that parable that said wait wait until you're called to the high place at the wedding feast don't put yourself up there but wait until somebody else puts you up there that's a lesson in all aspects of life you'll get embarrassed if you try to put yourself up there you'll get embarrassed many times because it won't work right it won't work the way that you think because you haven't waited for the word to position you and put you where god wants you instead you're trying to put yourself where you think that you should be but if you wait and let god let the spirit put you let god promote you then everything will work out god let god do the positioning brother said therefore he relied upon what god had made in him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what god made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer amen and you're a believer not because you put yourself in that situation but the holy spirit working in you put you and placed you the holy ghost is what made you what you are today and i want to say if you're not a believer this is where believers are made if you're not a believer right now then you've come to the right place if you want to enter into the entered into the the the circle of fellowship that come as jesus said to peter on the boat come come and eat freely the spirit of the bride can't say come now let me see where we can go from here because brother brown he begins to go on about how when you look at your inward to your heart at the situation of your heart and you know that something's wrong you cannot have confidence see trying to get positioned for perfect faith that's why first john 3 chapter 3 verse 18 says my little children let us not love and word neither in tongue but indeed in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have we confidence toward god so if you come before god and you're praying and something's you know something's not right you're sitting here in this in this sanctuary this afternoon and you know that you're not right with god then it's time to get that out get that taken care of seek forgiveness from those you've offended go back and patch things up in your life that that aren't right and you're not if you're not living right get everything straightened out because that's the only way that you can have confidence with god if you're a backslidden christian tonight and and something's not right in your life the only way you're going to have confidence from with god is to circle back around and get everything straightened up and line back up brother and said if there's condemnation in your life straighten that first see if you got condemnation or you might have oral robbers and a dozen more people who has faith to come in and pray over you and jump up and down and pour oil on you by the gallons it still won't move it still won't move if there's something down in your heart that prevents you from having confidence from god as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence with god you'll automatically know that you're wrong you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a believer and there's nothing between you and god you can ask what you will and know that it will be given because that's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples and brother said now the only thing you have to do then now this is a word that's so strange now listen this is have faith in what you are right you see how strangely worded that is you would think he would say have faith in god and faith in in the word and all those things those have come before the word has been built up in you it's produced something in you and now you come into a position where it's time to have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are and jesus had faith in the word of god that said what he was it is written of me it didn't david in the psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him i am the bread of life that come from god out of heaven i am that tree of life from the garden of eden i am all these things i am that i am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed messiah that the spirit of god was upon him he said now i and myself do nothing but it's my faith in god my faith in god and god was that it was in him the word made manifest now brother iran said the identification the identification of a scriptural christian these words said jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now see what he's doing he's saying first you have faith in god you believe his word then you recognize what god has accomplished in your life and you have faith in what you are and then you can look back and see that truly you are a christian because these signs shall follow them that believe and that is the scriptural identification of a scripture of a christian brotherhood said now how can you call yourself a believer at people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer and deny any of this word see you can't do it see when you believe the word it will actually produce and that's what faith is faith is the word made alive faith actually brings mark 16 to life where you you can take up deadly serpents you drink deadly things all of the things that were spoken of there it's on the paper but when faith grabs a hold of that it actually produces it it makes it a living reality brother brahman said you got to take the whole thing and believe it and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs follow them that believe and i am a personal witness that these signs shall follow them that believe if you live for god then signs and wonders will follow you it may may not be appropriate to say in a sermon but signs and wonders will follow you i i'm not going to list out all the things that i've seen in my own life but i can i can definitely tell you see you see people that people that say well i don't see god doing anything you see what he's saying there look at your own life i i i believed that for so many years and and i it's like i i'm seeing this for a new time seeing this afresh that brother branham said if you say that you don't see god doing anything in this church and the bride and all these things it's because that something is wrong with your own life it's time to begin inspecting your own life and seeing if you can identify your own life with the scripture and if you can't maybe it's because that you're not believing correctly because brother branham taught us that if you believe the word correctly it will have an effect it will produce something it will produce signs and wonders what kinds of signs and wonders well the sick will be healed the lame will walk the blind will see you'll get a revelation the word will be opened up to you and beyond that the light the word will be made alive to you it will become a living reality where you'll be you'll see something because you will have a personal relationship with god a love an agapo love relationship you and god alone well the brain said oh could you compare a christian today with them christians of long ago how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the holy ghost the holy ghost would say do it and they would do it a prisoner to the word and will of god he couldn't even move until god moved him and he said wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that it's going to going back it's got to come and he said it's on its road now i believe how was it on this road people were being born again back then people were catching a hole he said that i could count on one hand the number that caught the seven seals when he preached it but to me that means that at least one called something about what he was saying in other words it was on its road back then people were already catching a hold of what he was trying to say and being positionally placed placed into the body for perfect faith what what gives you perfect faith the word brother said before the word identified identified himself what he was and the same word identifies us in first john chapter 2 verses 3 to 5 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments see there's your identification he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected perfected hereby know we that we are in him amen if we know him and we keep his commandments in other words we're walking in his word putting one foot in front of the other walking and walking up that mountain up the statue of a perfect man allowing his word to be made manifest in us bringing just to a place where we can have perfect faith john 15 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and that shall be done unto you now brother iran said now see he knew who he was therefore he had faith faith could produce when he knowed what he was now if you abide in me and my word and you then you know who you are right ask what you will it'll be given to you now now come on now let's put this in the context of the sermons that we've been here put this in the context of adoption time and the capstone and the headstone the token and all these things when you know who you are if you abide in me and my word in you then you know who you are when the world is built up within you and packed in and the spirit comes and quickens then you know who you are so if this word told you something then you can have the same confidence then what's going to happen brother brown said jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my words and you my words this word abides in you then ask what you will and it'll be done for you see now you're coming into position for perfect faith and what makes it so hard to preach is when you're born again you've got perfect faith but you grow into more perfect faith and more perfect faith it's not that you don't have faith you've got faith but it continues to be built up and built up to a place to now all that doubt all that has been cast out and you come to a place where you know where you stand now now brother and i said he said and i'm closing in just a second he said to us if you abide in me and my word and you saint john here you can ask what you will it'll be done then recognize your position in this scripture as a believer recognize your position that's why i call it getting in a position for perfect faith recognize where you are see you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position i see you reckon that you can recognize him like they did on the road on the road to emmaus and when their eyes were open they recognized that that was jesus christ they recognized who that was and you could recognize there's a man walking on the water like peter did but peter recognized when jesus said come he recognized that i can do the same things that jesus is doing and he took a step out and began to walk on the water i can do the same thing that he did he began to recognize his position brother abraham said you're a christian you have right to any redemptive blessing that jesus died for you it's all yours it's already paid for you just have to believe it now imagine it but believe it and know that it's yours and you can possess it oh that's the conquering faith no yeah the musicians can come on if we could just get into position get into position like like had it right but put us in the position of hattie right there who was in the position of saying after the prophet had shared a testimony she was in the position of saying that's nothing but the truth now you're in that same position you're in the same position of you've heard the prophet's message and you're in the position now where you can say i believe that that's nothing but the truth and then she was in the position where god gave her the right to speak whatever you say whatever you say you can have you're in that same position you're now in the position where you've heard the word preached you've heard the message of the hour and now the word is in your mouth do you know you know a lot when we when we talk about the shout the voice and the trump we like we got the shout down that the message came brother brennan brought the message but we don't we got we kind of stumble over you actually taking the book out of the hand of the one give me the book take give me that and i'm going to take it and i'm going to become it i'm going to eat it and then i will be able to prophesy again as the scripture says it's time to fulfill to realize what position we have in the word amen you believe that now now you see i believe yeah go ahead and applaud and i believe that because of that because of the message that we've heard we've got we've come to a place where we can fulfill what god wants us to do and one of those things to fulfill is that god has made us a people that can worship so let's arise in worship let's worship the lord we should be able to worship him like no other people can't trust because we know what we believe and we know what we are amen 705. [Music] you have long for sweet peace and for faith to increase [Music] do you believe that you can have whatever [Music] claim those children that are out in the world claim it and believe it claim those lost loved ones whatever you say you can have it whatever you say matches right back up with the word [Music] you don't even have to have somebody lay hands on you or touch you or just enter in with him enter into that holy place and let god speak to you and perform a miracle in your life [Music] [Applause] let's just worship it [Music] you love him this afternoon [Music] if you need something tonight you don't have to leave without getting it just stand there right there in your seat and you can come forward and be prayed for it claim whatever you have need of god is here to give it to you that thing you've been trying to get rid of all those that bitterness and everything just just lay it down and let it go lay all of it down on the altar of sacrifice and let god sweep it away if you have never tried it before try it sometime give over all those burdens to him he said he's willing to take all of your burdens and bear them our burden bearer [Music] is it all laid on the offer every bit of it that's what he wants to see everything he wants you to come like that little woman that broke that bottle of woman over jesus feet and she broke it so she could never go back once it was broken there was no going back there was no going back for a refund there was no going back for the money back just come and come and lay it all at his feet let there be no going back no going back once you've broken that bottle at his feet [Music] hmm [Music] control [Music] that your promises are true lord and we join our faith together lord god claiming your word lord jesus that you'll come and touch our sister and your body lord jesus granted lord we believe lord that you'll manifest your world and manifest your healing today lord jesus you christ we pray that you might go rejoicing lord believing in your word [Music] amen [Music] is [Music] you can only be blessed [Music] amen that's the only way to have peace and sweet rest and just give it all over to him hey man you love him tonight anything else oh that's right yeah well i'll be gone i'll be uh speaking up there in blue ridge on sunday so or mackaysville yeah wherever that's right thank you all right let's just go to the lord in prayer and then we'll be dismissed lord god we thank you for your grace to us and for your spirit this evening lord and pray lord that you'll just go with all your people and protect them on the way home lord granted lord the words that were spoken tonight will sing in their heart lord jesus and give them confidence and faith lord jesus lord they might look at their own life lord and know that you've truly worked something in their life and that might build confidence in the lord jesus i pray lord that you'll build confidence in all of your saints lord jesus that when we come boldly before your throne lord jesus we'll be able to just stand boldly believing lord god and what we have heard and who we are lord jesus and who we who you are little god and come position lord jesus for perfect faith we thank you lord god for your grace to us now lord go with your people lord in the name of the lord jesus christ amen you're dismissed
