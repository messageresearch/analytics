[11:03] to the scripture Hebrews chap 10 verse
[11:07] 19-22 and uh just take a little topic
[11:11] little Wednesday night topic of how how
[11:13] do I
[11:19] overcome let's just go the Lord in
[11:21] prayer Lord God we're so grateful for
[11:24] this for the words of eternal life that
[11:26] you've given unto us in this age that
[11:28] takes tears down all the confusion and
[11:30] all the chaos and gives us Clarity on
[11:33] what we're doing here and what we need
[11:34] to do to go forward I pray God that
[11:36] you'll Lord be among us tonight Lord
[11:38] Jesus we've come Lord Jesus together to
[11:41] hear your word and to be strengthened
[11:43] Lord Jesus I pray God that you'll give
[11:45] us exactly what we have need of Lord be
[11:48] with my lips Lord Jesus to anoint me to

[11:52] with the right meaning the right effect
[11:53] Lord God and I pray that you'll be with
[11:55] your people to Quicken the words to them
[11:58] Lord Jesus we ask your bless blessing
[11:59] now in your name amen so Hebrews 10: 19
[12:04] starts off like this Paul's telling
[12:07] us having therefore Brethren boldness to
[12:11] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[12:13] Jesus by New and Living Way which he
[12:16] hath consecrated for us through the veil
[12:19] that is to say his flesh and having an
[12:22] high priest over the house of God let us
[12:25] draw near with a true heart and full
[12:27] Assurance of faith having our hearts
[12:30] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[12:33] our bodies washed with pure water God
[12:36] bless you you may take your
[12:39] seats of course we we know we we went
[12:42] through these scriptures in Sunday
[12:43] school and and uh it's it's kind of good
[12:46] to go back and rehearse some of the
[12:48] things that we read but you think about
[12:50] how that uh there's a New and Living Way
[12:53] Paul is telling us which he ha
[12:56] consecrated us through the veil of
[12:58] Christ flesh back behind the veil you
[13:02] know and that's modeling the Old
[13:04] Testament uh outer Court inner Court
[13:06] holy of holies model that way that you
[13:10] go from the outer Court to the inner
[13:11] Court to the holy of holies where you
[13:14] have that innermost fellowship with God
[13:17] and you think about behind the veil of
[13:19] Christ's flesh dwelt that same logos
[13:23] that same Pillar of Fire that led the
[13:25] children of Israel through the
[13:27] Wilderness that was that met Paul uh
[13:30] Moses there in the in the burning bush
[13:32] that spoke to all the different ones in
[13:34] different ways and different times and
[13:36] different seasons and now that same life
[13:39] was back behind the veil of Christ's
[13:42] flesh and that now you and I can have
[13:44] fellowship with that same life if we'll
[13:48] go through that process that was typed
[13:50] of outer Court inner Court holy of
[13:52] holies that's why Paul is saying let us
[13:54] draw near with a True Heart in full
[13:58] Assurance of Faith having our heart
[14:01] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[14:03] our bodies washed with pure water you
[14:06] think what a great promise that is that
[14:08] God can take somebody that doesn't have
[14:11] you know we've been kind of meditating
[14:13] on conscience that's got an evil
[14:14] conscience and he can sprinkle that
[14:17] conscience through with his blood and
[14:19] with his word and and change that so
[14:21] that your conscience is clear and your
[14:24] body can be washed with pure B water and
[14:27] clean you up so that you can walk and
[14:29] live in a Sanctified life so you know
[14:32] brother Brandon would ask that question
[14:33] why are people so tossed about why does
[14:36] it seem like people are so tossed about
[14:37] from this ever which way and you know
[14:39] you see people that'll they'll come to
[14:41] church for a little while and then they
[14:42] go out and they they they just can't uh
[14:45] live a stable Christian life and that's
[14:48] what we're meditating on this evening
[14:50] what what does it take for me to
[14:52] overcome and there's so many things that
[14:54] I can overc for us to overcome in this
[14:56] day that seems like the the do of Hell
[14:59] have just been leased in this age the
[15:01] internet the worldwide web is snatching
[15:04] people away and and uh things at at at
[15:07] at schools and everywhere you go at work
[15:10] it's enemies on every hand well how do I
[15:13] overcome those things and now even in
[15:16] you know you maybe you might just be
[15:18] sitting in your room with a video game
[15:19] and you might have all these mind
[15:21] battles and things well how do you how
[15:23] do you overcome there might not even be
[15:24] anybody sitting in the room with you
[15:26] just you and yourself and the devil
[15:29] giving you all these thoughts given all
[15:31] this torment well how how do I overcome
[15:34] well I thank God that God has given us
[15:36] the recipe for these things laying here
[15:38] in this scripture and if we can just get
[15:40] away from all the social media and get
[15:42] away from all the world worldly things
[15:44] and all the movies and things and look
[15:45] into the recipe of God's word we'll find
[15:48] out how to defeat the Devil at every
[15:49] turn now isn't that right that God
[15:52] whenever You' got a problem in life if
[15:54] you want to make a cake you go look at
[15:55] the recipe if you want to if you want to
[15:58] Pro figure out how you need to file your
[15:59] taxes go look at the
[16:01] documentation if you want to find out
[16:03] how to do anything in life there's a
[16:04] rule book and an instruction book and
[16:06] God has given us his rule book and if
[16:08] we'll follow it we'll we'll have
[16:10] overcoming power in our life and you you
[16:12] you think about what brother Ram said in
[16:14] in this sermon that we're just
[16:15] meditating on tonight he said I believe
[16:17] we're living in a very I think this was
[16:19] many many years ago I I believe we're
[16:22] living in a very wonderful glorious day
[16:24] of opportunity when people of this day
[16:27] living to see the Shadows of the coming
[16:30] of the Son of God oh if it was the
[16:31] Shadows back then what about now what
[16:34] what kind of a day should we we be
[16:36] living in now he said I believe with all
[16:38] my heart that the world is going to
[16:40] burst now into the greatest Revival that
[16:43] was ever known or it's going into the
[16:46] darkest chaos that's ever been known in
[16:49] history it's a great time of people to
[16:52] make a decision on what they're going to
[16:54] do now this was back way many many years
[16:57] ago where it it seemed like the whole
[16:59] nation was sitting at like a junction
[17:01] time and based on people's decision they
[17:05] were going to either go off down into
[17:07] chaos into the darkest chaos that's ever
[17:09] been known in history or burst now into
[17:11] the greatest Revival that was ever known
[17:14] now you think about the nation sitting
[17:16] in a junction time like that well what
[17:17] about what about you and I sitting
[17:19] whatever your your status and life is
[17:21] sitting here tonight it could be your
[17:23] Junction time where whatever way you
[17:26] turn that's the way you could either go
[17:28] to a great Revival and you know we know
[17:30] the days of Revival the the Revival Days
[17:32] Are Over the days where just worldwide
[17:35] everybody's jumping and shouting and
[17:38] great big worldwide Revival like they
[17:39] had overseas in John Wesley's days and
[17:42] isza Street and so forth those days are
[17:44] over oh but now when you when you make
[17:46] the right decision and you yield
[17:48] yourself to God and and take him at his
[17:50] word oh then the great there's a
[17:52] greatest Revival that's ever known that
[17:54] will start in your heart and in your
[17:55] life now that's what we're talking about
[17:58] tonight not not just kind of a head
[17:59] religion not just kind of an
[18:01] intellectual something but something
[18:03] that really takes place down in your
[18:05] soul something that takes place in your
[18:07] heart where you don't make a decision
[18:09] from your head but down on the inside
[18:11] that you make a decision where uh you
[18:14] you want to serve God and and and you
[18:15] make a decision to follow after him no
[18:18] matter what comes no matter what comes
[18:19] your way whether it's heartache whether
[18:21] it's trials where whether it's
[18:23] difficulties you've set your mind on
[18:25] things above and you're going to stay
[18:27] with it no matter what now that's when
[18:29] something really begins to take place I
[18:31] was looking at the hour the message the
[18:33] hour has come or brother brother said
[18:35] the time has come the time has come when
[18:38] the sign should follow the Believers the
[18:41] time has come for the church to move up
[18:43] or go back you have to make your
[18:45] decision isn't that right the time has
[18:48] come and maybe tonight if you haven't
[18:50] decided to make your decision yet maybe
[18:52] the time has come for you to do so maybe
[18:55] the time has come for you to figure out
[18:56] what you're going to do and what
[18:57] direction you're going to go in or
[18:59] whether you're going to give your heart
[19:00] to God or
[19:01] not the time has come and I I I think to
[19:05] meditate on what he's saying there the
[19:06] time has come when sign should follow
[19:08] the Believers if we're ready really
[19:10] meditate on those words that he's saying
[19:12] that to to really take hold of it that
[19:14] that I want to see God moving in my life
[19:17] that I want to see something taking
[19:18] place in my life and you know brother
[19:20] Ram said that many times spiritual Le
[19:23] people some because the sons of God are
[19:25] going to be led by the spirit of God
[19:27] they're going to be something
[19:28] Supernatural is taking place in their
[19:30] life and he said many times spiritual Le
[19:33] people are going to be misunderstood
[19:35] because it's such a strange and an odd
[19:37] life to live a full surrendered life to
[19:40] the Lord
[19:41] Jesus Oh somebody somebody that's
[19:43] overcome it's strange to see somebody
[19:45] that's overcome somebody that's overcome
[19:48] the things of this world and don't want
[19:50] nothing to do with the world it's
[19:52] strange we we were talking about on the
[19:54] way in you know the the girls had
[19:56] interviewed a little job and and they
[19:58] they uh they they they told them they
[20:00] were going to be hired and they sent
[20:01] them all the paperwork and everything
[20:03] well they they told they sent them the
[20:04] the thing that said you got to you we
[20:07] want to know what your pant size is well
[20:09] they messaged them back and say well we
[20:11] don't wear pants and
[20:14] crickets I ain't heard nothing back for
[20:16] like three or four days why cuz it's odd
[20:19] it's different you're different it just
[20:22] it's beyond finding out like that the
[20:24] world just don't know what to do with
[20:25] you if you're if you're if you've
[20:27] overcome the things of this world you're
[20:29] going to act different you're going to
[20:30] dress different and I don't think that's
[20:33] anything to be ashamed of oh when you
[20:35] find yourself being ashamed of the
[20:36] Gospel or ashamed of your mom or your
[20:38] daddy or ashamed of the way that your
[20:39] parents or your grandparents dress or
[20:41] ashamed the way your church is or it's
[20:43] time to time to go past that Veil past
[20:45] the past the inner Veil to go into that
[20:47] Holy place and find out that there is
[20:50] really a living God that'll change you
[20:52] and make you act differently and dress
[20:53] differently and talk differently what
[20:55] does somebody what does a spiritual Leed
[20:57] person look like that the world finds
[21:00] odd and strange they're going to act
[21:01] different aren't they they're going to
[21:03] dress differently they're going to act
[21:05] differently they're going to be living
[21:07] by their conscience living and guided by
[21:10] a conscience that keeps them from doing
[21:12] things at work that other people don't
[21:13] have no problem doing things you keeps
[21:15] you from doing things maybe even at
[21:17] church that other people don't have any
[21:18] problem doing it's going to make you
[21:20] live a life where you can have love and
[21:22] compassion for other people oh that's
[21:24] the kind of life that I want a life
[21:26] where you can love somebody that hates
[21:27] you and have compassion for somebody
[21:29] that nobody else can have compassion for
[21:31] you oh I'm talking about a Christian
[21:33] Life where you can have fellowship with
[21:35] other people and you want to live in
[21:36] unity not division but you want to come
[21:38] together in fellowship and Community
[21:40] where you can you want to live in peace
[21:42] and forgiveness oh that's what a real
[21:44] Christian holy ghost filled life that's
[21:46] what an overcoming life is where you
[21:48] live in peace peace and forgiveness and
[21:50] you're trying to bring peace instead of
[21:52] division you're trying to forgive
[21:54] instead of Harbor up all these uh Ledger
[21:56] books of things that people have done to
[21:57] you over the years years but you're
[21:59] trying to forgive you're trying to
[22:00] you're trying to cover things over
[22:01] because all of your sins were covered
[22:03] over by what Christ did for you on
[22:05] calvary or a real overcoming life is
[22:08] going to have faith and trust in God
[22:10] because your life is going to be lived
[22:12] by faith your whole life is based on
[22:15] faith so when when there's it looks like
[22:16] there's nothing to have faith in when
[22:18] the doctor tells you there's there's
[22:20] just no hope when it looks like all hope
[22:22] is gone but yet there's something down
[22:24] on the inside of a real believing
[22:26] Christian that hangs on because your
[22:28] life is based on faith and you know a
[22:32] Believer a Believer is always going to
[22:33] believe that's what they known by
[22:35] because they trust they trust in God and
[22:38] no matter what comes no matter what the
[22:39] situation is they're still going to
[22:42] trust and believe in God right amen and
[22:44] that's why the mark of a real believer
[22:47] is going to be truth and faith and
[22:50] integrity and honesty that's a real
[22:52] Hallmark of a real Christian as living
[22:55] their you know what Integrity is as
[22:56] behaving the same way in public and
[22:58] private is behaving the same way all the
[23:00] time and living your life based on a set
[23:03] of rules that come straight out of the
[23:05] word of God that that make boundaries
[23:07] for your life and restrictions and rules
[23:09] and constraints that make you live a
[23:11] life of honesty and integrity and God
[23:14] wants us to live a life of honesty and
[23:16] brother Ram said there's one thing that
[23:18] a person must always be and that is
[23:21] honest tell things so that you can go
[23:25] back and tell it a million times and
[23:28] it'll be be the same thing now that's
[23:30] how you want to live a peaceful life I
[23:33] remember growing up when I was a
[23:34] teenager you know you'd say something
[23:35] you'd try to get out of something you
[23:37] know and and then now you got to connect
[23:39] all the dots well I said this and now so
[23:41] I got to I got to say it this way next
[23:43] time but but if you just if you're just
[23:45] honest all the time that you don't have
[23:47] to remember what you said last time you
[23:49] don't remember have to remember what you
[23:50] said yesterday and then the week before
[23:52] that and a month before that to make
[23:53] sure the whole story lines up all you
[23:55] got to do is just be honest and tell it
[23:57] the way it is tell things so that you
[23:59] can go back and tell it a million times
[24:01] and it'll be the same thing you see so
[24:04] just be honest no matter if it's bad or
[24:07] whether it's good be honest and if it's
[24:10] against you say it anyhow or keep still
[24:13] don't say it at all see no no matter
[24:16] what it is brother Brandon would say if
[24:19] a man is not as good as his word you
[24:22] can't trust him because he's not no good
[24:26] now where's that come from it come from
[24:29] God now we're come from God so we're
[24:30] going to act like our daddy and our
[24:32] daddy when he says something you know
[24:34] you can trust that in fact he gave us
[24:36] two immutable evidences two things two
[24:38] that God the god that can't lie swore an
[24:41] oath on top of that so we we could TR we
[24:43] know we can trust God now if we come
[24:45] from God then that makes us honest just
[24:47] like our daddy so if we say something
[24:49] then we're going to stick with it we're
[24:50] going to stay with the word you you can
[24:53] you can uh you can trust on a real
[24:55] Christian's word just like you can trust
[24:58] in the word of your daddy now now if you
[25:00] really realize that you if you really
[25:02] look at the word of God like that when
[25:04] God promises something you can trust it
[25:08] when your daddy says something you can
[25:09] trust it and if you're like your daddy
[25:12] you can trust your word too now he said
[25:15] just be honest no matter if it's bad or
[25:17] whether it's good be honest I I think
[25:20] sometimes we have trouble with that even
[25:21] in our own life you know some sometimes
[25:23] you struggle the man well I don't want
[25:25] to tell my wife if I don't like her food
[25:27] but now come come on now you can layer
[25:29] some love on top of it and say I would I
[25:31] would rather not eat this kind of food
[25:34] and then you'll be happier for it cuz if
[25:36] you don't like it then why you why
[25:38] should you have to eat it come on now
[25:41] I'm talking some truth hon honesty
[25:43] Honesty will make your life

[25:48] and cheese then why should you have to
[25:51] eat macaroni and cheese if you don't
[25:52] like it just be honest and be frank and
[25:54] be real if you come on now let's get
[25:57] home now if you don't like the preaching
[25:59] be H just be honest sometimes I I wish I
[26:02] W you know sometimes my wife will tell
[26:04] me you went too fast you went too slow
[26:07] or whatever or I didn't understand and
[26:09] you know what it helps to be honest not

[26:44] honest you know you come to church
[26:46] sometimes and you just can't understand
[26:48] the preaching you might as well be
[26:49] honest with yourself be honest with
[26:50] yourself and be honest with the preacher
[26:51] be honest with the teacher and say I
[26:53] wish that you would frame a little bit
[26:55] different and just be honest and that'll
[26:57] help everybody it'll help you it'll help
[26:59] the preacher to be honest and if you're
[27:00] struggling to overcome just be honest if
[27:04] you're struggling to overcome you might
[27:05] as well be honest with yourself and say
[27:07] I got a problem with this thing that I'm
[27:08] trying to overcome and if you're not
[27:10] convinced be honest if you have a
[27:12] question you might as well be honest and
[27:14] you know what God will bless an honest
[27:17] heart God will bless you in your home
[27:19] God will bless you in your marriage if
[27:21] you're honest if you're honest with your
[27:23] kids he'll Bless you that's the problem
[27:25] we've got sometimes we draw back from
[27:27] just being being honest with our kids
[27:30] well I don't think you should take
[27:32] communion how about that as honesty I
[27:35] don't think you're at a place where you
[27:37] really are dedicated enough and really
[27:39] sincere enough and let's have an honest
[27:42] conversation and just lay it out there
[27:44] but we draw back from being honest we'll
[27:46] say well I I I don't want to hurt their
[27:48] feelings I don't want and that's our
[27:51] problem isn't it when when somebody's
[27:53] honest with you and you draw back
[27:54] because you don't want your feelings
[27:55] hurt then it it it that that that's the
[27:58] problem that we all have to we all have
[28:00] God will bless an honest heart we must
[28:02] be honest in heart now now look what
[28:05] honesty
[28:07] is honesty is based on truth and our
[28:10] daddy is
[28:11] honest and when he says something you
[28:13] can Bank on it amen and the whole chist
[28:16] whole of Christianity is based on
[28:18] honesty and truth so much that if you
[28:21] want to see a devil cast out be
[28:24] honest that's how you cast out Devils is
[28:27] be honest be honest and real don't cloak
[28:30] it over with no deceit don't try to
[28:32] cover it over with some some deception
[28:34] or some manipulation but just be real
[28:37] honest be real honest and true now
[28:40] there's a TR there's a secret if you
[28:41] want to see a devil leave you come up
[28:44] for prayer and you just lay it all out
[28:46] there and you say I'm coming with an
[28:47] honest heart and I want to be delivered
[28:49] of this thing I want to be delivered of
[28:51] the thing that I'm trying to get rid of
[28:53] I'm trying to overcome and you come and
[28:55] lay it all out there at God's feet and
[28:57] say God you take care of and I'm coming
[28:59] with an honest heart I'm coming
[29:01] believing I'm coming believing what you
[29:03] said because I know you're a God that
[29:04] keeps his promises and you see if God
[29:07] doesn't come and keep his word and give
[29:09] you something that you can that will
[29:10] anchor your soul that you can overcome
[29:13] with Honesty will cast out Devils right
[29:17] Honesty will cast out Devils Amen in
[29:20] John 8:32 it says and ye shall know the
[29:23] truth and the truth shall make you free
[29:27] why it's honest communication it's
[29:30] something coming over the pulpit that
[29:32] really will that that you know is true
[29:34] and you recognize it's true it's not
[29:36] fake it's not false but it's the truth
[29:40] and the truth an honest truth is what
[29:42] will set you free of the devil's
[29:45] captivity and you'll watch those chains
[29:48] drop off your life and and you'll begin
[29:50] to have real and real overcoming
[29:52] experience like what was spoken of in
[29:54] John 17:17 where Jesus said sanctify
[29:57] them through through thy truth Thy word
[30:00] is truth now if the word is truth and
[30:04] the word received in a penitent heart
[30:06] that desires to be truthful will
[30:09] actually cleanse you and sanctify you
[30:11] how by getting rid of the Devils getting
[30:13] rid of the devils in your life getting
[30:16] rid of everything that plagues and
[30:18] besets you it the truth the honest truth
[30:21] is the thing that set you free and John
[30:23] 17:19 Jesus said and for their sakes I
[30:26] sanctify myself that they also might be
[30:29] Sanctified through the truth how you
[30:32] going to be Sanctified through the truth
[30:34] not a lie we're not coming to church to
[30:36] hear some deceiving words or some kind
[30:38] of manipulation or something but we're
[30:40] here to hear the transparent freely
[30:43] given freely available truth the honest
[30:47] truth not mixed with any kind of a lie
[30:50] but the honest truth and honesty listen
[30:52] now Honesty will take care of any kind
[30:54] of a devil that's in your life Honesty
[30:55] will take care of
[30:56] infidelity somebody's cheating on
[30:58] somebody else maybe a young person got
[31:00] caught up in something at school or
[31:01] whatever and they're cheating on their
[31:03] boyfriend or girlfriend but you you
[31:04] bring it back home and just lay it out
[31:07] there in honesty I'm sorry I did
[31:10] something wrong now you might not get
[31:12] the the result that you want but at
[31:14] least you'll be honest and you'll be
[31:16] free in your conscience your conscience
[31:19] will be free now that's what we want so
[31:22] sometimes we avoid being honest because
[31:24] we we we don't we we're afraid we're not
[31:26] going to get the desire that we want to
[31:28] see but the desire that I think every
[31:30] Christian wants to see is a pure
[31:32] conscience a pure heart where your
[31:35] conscience is clean and honesty will
[31:37] take care of prejudice where where you
[31:39] don't want to talk to somebody else
[31:41] because they're different than you or
[31:42] because they're richer or poor or
[31:44] whatever but oh you just let a real
[31:45] honest CH you know you know brother I I
[31:48] I I've been looking across the parking
[31:49] lot at you and I hadn't really got to
[31:51] know you before but I'd like to take you
[31:52] out to eat sometime or something and you
[31:54] just have a real honest conversation and
[31:56] watch that devil of Prejudice leave you
[31:59] and you'll be different that devil of
[32:01] corruption somebody at work trying to to
[32:03] do something uh uh uh behind behind
[32:07] somebody's back or whatever go around go
[32:09] around corners and everything but just
[32:10] real Honesty will take care of that
[32:12] Honesty will take care of a cheater at
[32:14] school just looking over at their
[32:16] friend's desk honesty and you know
[32:18] that's what God wants us to be is he
[32:20] wants us to be honest in our schoolwork
[32:23] if you if you'll really buckle down and
[32:24] do your schoolwork and try your very
[32:26] best and not try to cheat
[32:28] not but but to really do it do your very
[32:31] best then that's something that you can
[32:33] be proud of how can you be proud if you
[32:35] looking on your friend's paper and
[32:37] you're copying everything and and trying
[32:39] to trying to get credit for what they've
[32:41] done and then at the end of the school
[32:42] year you look back and you haven't
[32:44] learned nothing you haven't done nothing
[32:46] because you're just kind of riding
[32:47] somebody's coattails and that's how a
[32:49] lot of Christians are too they don't
[32:51] want to learn anything they just want to
[32:52] ride a preacher's coattails they don't
[32:54] have an experience for their yourself
[32:55] they just want somebody else to tell
[32:56] them what they should believe and tell
[32:58] them how they should act and hang on to
[33:00] somebody's coattails but God wants
[33:02] honest communication he wants honesty
[33:06] honesty from the beginning to the end
[33:08] and honesty will take care of your
[33:10] mental
[33:11] health that's that's why so many times
[33:14] we got to pop pills and things because
[33:16] because we just ain't living an honest
[33:18] life we we're harboring all this
[33:19] resentment and all this things against
[33:21] everybody else and then we got to go to
[33:22] the doctor and i' I've I've sat there at
[33:24] work and listen to people tell ask
[33:27] questions about the health care and and
[33:29] they'll raise their hands and they'll
[33:30] say well I'm taking $400 on for drugs a
[33:33] month on and things like that and and
[33:35] and then you find out Christians are
[33:36] having to do the same thing because they
[33:38] got such horrible mental health problems
[33:40] and I'm not saying nothing against
[33:42] doctors or any kind of those kind of
[33:43] things you know you got to do what you
[33:44] got to do but God God gave us a way to
[33:47] be free of these things so that you can
[33:49] have Clarity in your mind and you're not
[33:51] you're not bound by the by the devil
[33:53] putting all this weight of the all these
[33:55] things in your mind that you're trying
[33:56] to battle out and I I'll tell you if you
[33:59] just be honest with be honest with your
[34:00] wife be honest with your children be
[34:03] honest with the preachers at church be
[34:05] honest with everybody at church and
[34:07] you'll find out that the devil will
[34:10] leave be honest it's the truth it's the
[34:14] truth that is taking us to a higher
[34:16] plane of Revelation and understanding
[34:18] now it isn't that isn't that the case
[34:20] that that's what we come for is the
[34:21] truth and the truth that we hear is
[34:23] piling on piling on until in our hearts
[34:26] and in our minds until we're changing
[34:28] to be true to be perfect that's what
[34:31] Perfection is complete until we're true
[34:35] like our father is and brother Ram said
[34:39] he said he told this story as he was
[34:40] preaching this sermon he said I went
[34:41] home tired
[34:43] weary upset crying went to bed and after
[34:48] the wife got to sleep I went in the room
[34:51] and knelt down and said dear Jesus I
[34:54] don't know what I'm going to do
[34:57] here I am right back where I started
[34:59] from
[35:00] again I guess I made a failure about two
[35:04] hours from then he appeared to
[35:06] me see how sometimes you got you got to
[35:09] pray for a while don't give up he
[35:12] started praying and he said two hours
[35:14] later he
[35:16] appeared and he showed me a vision of
[35:18] such a panoramic view of people I never
[35:21] seen I was talking to my wife in The
[35:25] Vision now think about I I I really like
[35:27] to just meditate on these things these
[35:29] stories that he's telling sometimes we
[35:31] just we'll listen have a tape playing in
[35:32] the in the background and we're not
[35:33] really paying attention but let's let's
[35:35] meditate on this so he's seeing a vision
[35:38] of a panoramic view of people and he
[35:41] said now you people that I know that
[35:43] know me I I know I'm not a fanatic I
[35:45] don't say these things unless they're
[35:46] the
[35:47] truth I thank God for a prophet that
[35:49] would not just be uh flippant with
[35:53] saying something but he'd wait till God
[35:55] he was sure God showed it to him and
[35:58] then he made sure that he was telling
[36:00] people the
[36:01] truth oh thank God that we can read a
[36:04] message like that with confidence that
[36:06] it's the truth and this thing the story
[36:09] that I'm telling you is the truth that's
[36:11] right and I seen it then I seen brother
[36:13] arganbright standing there and I went up
[36:14] to him and he said Billy brother Billy
[36:16] we've given out all the prayer cards and
[36:19] everything's ready now for the meeting
[36:21] we got a way to take you in and out I
[36:23] said thank you brother arganbright and I
[36:25] walked over to some more Brethren and
[36:27] they was another brother preaching I
[36:29] said who's he they said they put him
[36:32] up I said who who is they he he's
[36:36] turning around there's there's somebody
[36:37] else preaching how hey what's going on
[36:41] and they just turned around walked away
[36:43] and the man made dismissed the audience
[36:46] and let them all go I said oh you
[36:49] shouldn't do that because there's no
[36:51] altar call oh they said another fellow
[36:54] spoke up and said we we done took up the
[36:56] offering I said when is the offering
[36:59] more important than Souls before Christ
[37:02] see now in this Vision they were
[37:04] prioritizing money something else over
[37:08] Souls oh that's the main thing of any
[37:11] church service that's when you come
[37:13] together sometimes we lose focus of the
[37:15] thing that we're coming to church to
[37:16] kind of see one another we're coming to
[37:17] church to to eat at lunch and and have
[37:20] some fellowship and whatnot but the main
[37:21] focus of this whole thing is souls and
[37:24] that's what brother brandom got all
[37:25] upset about is is what what about the
[37:27] alter call who was that everything was
[37:30] off kilter and this man was up there
[37:32] speaking and they dismi he dismissed the
[37:34] service and he said and and another
[37:36] fellow spoke up and said we we done took
[37:39] up the offering like that was the main
[37:41] thing and and my friends money ain't the
[37:43] main thing that ain't Why We Gather and
[37:46] there ain't any other main thing other
[37:48] than Souls that is the only reason that
[37:51] is the main reason all the other things
[37:54] around that the songs that we sing and
[37:56] the fellowship and the the cushy pews
[37:59] that we sit on and everything everything
[38:02] is just accessory to that fact that
[38:04] we're here for Souls that's what we're
[38:06] here to do is win souls so brother
[38:09] brandom was no was so upset there was no
[38:11] altar call and oh think that tonight how
[38:14] much value how much value did that man
[38:16] Place upon Souls we're just going to
[38:18] we're just going to dismiss the
[38:20] congregation we got the offering that's
[38:22] what that's what the service meant to
[38:24] him but there ain't how much value do
[38:27] you place on a soul how much value do we
[38:30] place on a soul to think that your soul
[38:32] is worth 10,000 worlds and so then God
[38:36] took him and showed him a vision
[38:38] efficient for Souls efficient for souls
[38:41] he taken me up to a real bright stream
[38:43] of water it was the most beautiful blue
[38:46] water and great fish were swimming
[38:47] around in it he said I will make you a
[38:50] Fisher and he said Now cast your lure
[38:53] into the water and when you do pull it
[38:56] slow first time
[38:58] and the next time just give it a little
[39:00] jerk not too hard and the next time set
[39:05] your hook for the
[39:06] catch and so there's three PS go
[39:10] go got it and he said I got it all
[39:14] excited and jerked it hard on the next
[39:16] one out and I pulled the fish and all
[39:19] out of the water and what it was it was
[39:22] a little bitty fish and it just about
[39:24] the size of the lure and I got my mind
[39:27] all tangled up and I was straightening
[39:29] out my line and the man was behind me
[39:31] this man which was behind me walked
[39:34] around in front of
[39:36] me dressed how in Palestinian cloes with
[39:41] a turban on his head he had a turban on
[39:44] his
[39:45] head I I know y'all heard this story
[39:48] before but maybe you hadn't which is why
[39:50] I'm reading it like this he had a white
[39:53] robe he said brother Brandon that's it I
[39:55] said I know I didn't do it right I said
[39:58] I jerked it when I ought not to and he
[40:00] said don't get your line tangled up in
[40:05] these kinds of times I said well I'm
[40:07] running as straight as I can I'll be
[40:10] very careful the angel told him you was
[40:13] always trying to explain it you oughtn't
[40:16] to have done that he said you made a
[40:18] public showing out of it now let's
[40:21] examine the night where brother Brandon
[40:23] messed up in that Vision sometimes the
[40:26] Supernatural is be Beyond explanation
[40:29] and the fishing line got all tangled up
[40:31] when he tried to explain it he tried to
[40:34] make it public and you'll see as we go
[40:37] along studying this thing out the third
[40:39] pool is private it's something that
[40:41] happens to you as an individual you know
[40:44] many times in your Supernatural life
[40:46] things will happen God will do something
[40:47] for you private that you can't share but
[40:51] it's expressed in different ways anybody
[40:53] can look at somebody and see see that
[40:55] something's happened to them in a
[40:57] private realm so something happened
[40:59] privately to a Christian and they got a
[41:01] private New Birth a private experience
[41:05] and then they come to church and you can
[41:06] see that something's changed something
[41:09] happened privately something happened
[41:11] down on the inside something happened to
[41:14] you in that little room in John 3:3
[41:18] Jesus answered and said unto them verily
[41:20] verily I say unto thee except a man be
[41:22] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[41:25] God
[41:27] so something happens to you privately
[41:29] where you can see the kingdom of God but
[41:31] then you can't explain to somebody else
[41:32] what you see you can try to explain but
[41:35] they can't see unless they're born again
[41:38] you don't know what's in that holy of
[41:40] holies you don't really know unless
[41:42] you're born again the only way that you
[41:45] can really see is you've got to be born
[41:47] again and I'll give you an example they
[41:49] probed and argued at at Matthew 28:19
[41:52] that Jesus said that you got to be
[41:55] baptized in the name of the father
[41:57] Father Son and Holy Ghost and Peter come
[41:59] down on the day of Pentecost because he
[42:02] could see he he was saying like brother
[42:05] Donaldo was preaching he was saying the
[42:07] same thing that Jesus said but if you're
[42:10] not born again you can't see that you
[42:13] can't see it the right way when you're
[42:15] born again your eyes become open now you
[42:17] see what the evidence of the new birth
[42:19] is that you can see your ey your
[42:22] spiritual eyes become open and that's
[42:25] why in 2 Corinthians it says therefore
[42:26] if any man being Christ he is a new
[42:28] creature old things are passed away
[42:31] behold all things are become new and
[42:34] Revelation chapter 3:20 says behold I
[42:37] stand at the door and knock If any man
[42:39] hear my voice and open the door I will
[42:42] come into him and will suck with him and
[42:46] he with me now there's God knocking at
[42:48] your door and if you open up the door
[42:50] then he'll come in and the door shut
[42:52] behind you and it's you and God in there
[42:54] eating over the table it's you and God
[42:57] in there alone private something
[42:59] happened I I thank God that the gospel
[43:01] is set up that way that even here while
[43:03] I'm speaking to you you in amongst all
[43:06] of this group here together that
[43:08] something can H be happening privately
[43:10] with different individuals that's why I
[43:13] I love some sometimes you you know you
[43:15] go preach and and it some seems like
[43:16] everybody's draw draws back but other
[43:19] times you preach and it seems like
[43:21] you're just preaching to a congregation
[43:22] where tears are rolling down people's
[43:24] faces and what is it it's they're
[43:26] sitting there in public amongst
[43:28] everybody else but something private is
[43:31] happening something H is happening that
[43:34] that maybe the person next to you don't
[43:36] have nothing no idea what's going on
[43:39] that's why brother R said then he taken
[43:41] me from there and I seen a great huge
[43:44] tent I never seen such a tent and it was
[43:48] packed and lined everywhere with people
[43:51] looked like I was standing above the
[43:52] people looking down where I just made an
[43:55] altar call and hundreds and hundreds of
[43:59] people were weeping and rejoicing after
[44:01] they had accepted the Lord Jesus as
[44:03] their Savior and I looked and then heard
[44:06] a man get up and say call the prayer
[44:09] line I think that's two very striking
[44:12] things about this third pool Vision that
[44:15] it was well it was packed with people
[44:18] and there was something there to attract
[44:20] them they weren there to see some
[44:22] television show but they were there to
[44:25] see something
[44:27] truthful something
[44:30] real and and there was these two things
[44:33] that seems like everybody in the message
[44:35] always battles about here in this third
[44:37] pool Vision there was an altar call and
[44:40] there was a prayer line now I you know
[44:43] brother BR said an alter call sometimes
[44:45] you man gets to pulling at people and
[44:47] saying well don't you aren't you afraid
[44:49] of your mama's going to die or whatever
[44:50] but when God really begins to draw now
[44:52] there's a real alter call that God's
[44:55] doing the drawing amen and he said
[44:57] people begin to line up over on this
[44:59] side the left from where I was looking
[45:01] down the platform and they lined all the
[45:03] way up and down the street for a prayer
[45:06] line and I noticed to my left which
[45:08] would have been to my right if I was on
[45:10] the platform a little wooden building
[45:13] and I seen that light that all they have
[45:16] the picture of you know that's always in
[45:17] the meetings I seen that light leave me
[45:20] and go to that building and go in that
[45:22] building and a voice said to me I'll
[45:24] meet you in there that'll be the third
[45:28] pool and I said why he said well it
[45:32] won't be a public show like the other
[45:35] and he said I'm just going to kind of
[45:36] skip through my notes he said I don't
[45:38] understand going into that closet like
[45:40] that that little think now in that big
[45:43] huge tent that little wooden wooden room
[45:45] right there in the middle of it and
[45:47] brother R said I don't understand going
[45:49] into that closet like that and then and
[45:52] and the angel told him he referred to
[45:53] Matthew chapter 6 that says doesn't the
[45:56] scripture say
[45:57] when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as
[46:00] the Hypocrites are for they love to pray
[46:03] standing in the synagogues and in the
[46:05] corners of the streets that they may be
[46:06] seen of men verily I say unto you they
[46:09] have their reward but thou when thou
[46:12] prayest enter into thy
[46:14] closet and when thou Hast shut thy door
[46:17] pray to thy father which is in secret
[46:20] and thy father which seeth in secret
[46:23] shall reward thee openly and brother
[46:25] random will refer to that little
[46:27] building as a closet to tie it with this
[46:30] scripture in Matthew chapter 6 when thou
[46:32] prayest enter into thy closet because
[46:35] something's going to happen to you in
[46:36] your private Closet in your private
[46:39] chamber where just you and God alone and
[46:42] he would say I just believe that little
[46:44] old Tabernacle is going to spread out
[46:46] and it's just going to be marvelous what
[46:48] the Lord will
[46:50] do oh sometimes when it's when you get
[46:53] alone that's when you really find
[46:55] something that you can anchor to when
[46:57] you get along with God and you begin to
[46:59] maybe maybe shut the door and just begin
[47:00] to think about God's word and his
[47:03] promises that's when you something
[47:05] really anchors down in your heart and
[47:07] the things maybe that you've heard
[47:09] through the week or that on that tape
[47:10] you've been listening to it begins to be
[47:12] real to you then you've got a real
[47:15] anchor you you know sometimes you go to
[47:17] work and it seems like people say
[47:19] hurtful things and at church or whatever
[47:21] and you just s so tossed about by
[47:24] everything but when you get into your
[47:26] little private time with God that's when
[47:29] things begin to get different maybe
[47:31] you've got something against your
[47:32] brother maybe you got something against
[47:34] somebody or you don't even know which
[47:36] direction to turn what what should I
[47:38] where where should I go to school where
[47:40] should I go to church but you get along
[47:42] with God and you begin to meditate on
[47:44] his word and you begin to talk to him
[47:46] and he talks back and something real
[47:48] begins to take place now come on church
[47:51] that's where we really begin to get
[47:52] anchored when we're alone with God so
[47:56] alone with God God we where you're not
[47:58] hindered by all the other things of this
[48:00] life all the other things of the world
[48:02] you're not hindered by some some
[48:04] nonsense that somebody told you well I
[48:06] don't think you'll ever receive it I
[48:07] don't think you'll ever get healed but
[48:09] you get along with God and find out what
[48:11] God says about it and then you'll find
[48:13] out that you're not tossed about a
[48:16] Christian is not tossed about why
[48:18] because a Christian's faith has got a
[48:20] solid resting place you know we paint
[48:24] the picture in our mind so many times of
[48:25] like a a boat on the sea that's tossed
[48:27] around about but uh brother Ram said he
[48:30] was in a plane one time and he was
[48:31] looking down at a boat in the harbor and
[48:34] he was wondering how that boat could
[48:36] be why it wouldn't move out of its place
[48:39] in the middle of the storm that he was
[48:40] looking at and the guy next to him said
[48:42] well is anchored it's anchored it's it's
[48:45] it's not it's not moving around because
[48:47] it's got an anchor and every Christian's
[48:49] anchored to the word of God the truth
[48:52] that they have heard the truth that they
[48:54] believe and that is their anchor I think
[48:56] God tonight that my faith don't have any
[48:59] don't doesn't rest in any ability that I
[49:01] would have it doesn't rest in any
[49:03] ability that anybody has or upon what
[49:06] church I belong to or what people I
[49:10] associate with but my faith anchors and
[49:12] rest entirely upon the finished work of
[49:15] the Lord Jesus Christ already been
[49:18] received and that's why so many people
[49:21] kind of get tossed around about cuz they
[49:23] don't have that anchor right he said
[49:25] I've noticed many Christians is in my
[49:27] life to be up and down I've wondered
[49:28] about that now if you're like that
[49:30] tonight if you're if you're tossed about
[49:32] and and you want to you want to have a
[49:34] real stable relationship with God like
[49:36] your parents do or like the the other
[49:38] believers at church
[49:41] do maybe that's a question to
[49:44] ask why am I tossed
[49:47] about he said there are people who seem
[49:49] to be very religious seems to have such
[49:51] a deep
[49:54] desire and daily they search and hunt
[49:57] and seek for God and never come to any
[49:59] settlement of any kind to where they
[50:01] could ever be settled or anchored into
[50:04] Christ now I'm just kind of going to
[50:06] take a quick detour here I think years
[50:08] ago when brother rown was preaching
[50:09] sermons like this that was the case that
[50:12] people were searching and hunting and
[50:13] seeking and trying to get but they just
[50:15] couldn't get stable and that's what he's
[50:16] preaching at I think now the danger is
[50:20] that people just don't really care
[50:21] anymore I I I had a young man that asked
[50:24] me a question uh when I was preaching at
[50:26] a church he said what do you think the
[50:27] the most dangerous thing that young
[50:28] people face today is and I I told him I
[50:30] think it's apathy I think that's the
[50:32] most dangerous thing that anybody faces
[50:34] is they just just don't really care
[50:36] anymore they they come and they sit and
[50:38] they look and and they're and they're
[50:39] there but what is what is the point that
[50:42] brother R's getting that the heart the
[50:43] heart is not in it if your heart's not
[50:46] in it you know you can memorize
[50:47] scriptures and you can look at things
[50:49] from your mind from your intellectual
[50:51] standpoint and and learn and and learn
[50:53] all the Greek words and all the
[50:54] different meanings and things but if
[50:55] your heart's not in it something's wrong
[50:58] you're not stable that's why he would
[51:01] say there's two different kinds of
[51:03] christianities an intellectual or a
[51:05] mental conception of what God has said
[51:07] in his word and an experience that God
[51:11] has given the man in his heart do y do
[51:13] y'all know what that means to have an
[51:15] experience an intellectual conception
[51:17] where you can read about it and you see
[51:19] or you you listen to what somebody else
[51:21] has said but an experience is where
[51:24] you've been there yourself am is where
[51:27] you have lived through it yourself when
[51:30] you can look back at the scripture and
[51:32] say I I was there I was there when when
[51:36] Jacob was wrestling with the angel I
[51:38] know what that's like I was there when
[51:41] Ruth come from the moabites and she
[51:43] heard a message and she turned and she
[51:45] said I'm I'm going to go with I'm your
[51:48] God is going to be my God and your
[51:49] people's going to be my people I was I
[51:52] was there when David was pulled from the
[51:53] Sheep coat I was there when Moses made
[51:57] God at the burning bush and then you can
[52:01] know because you've had your own
[52:03] experience and you've Liv through it now
[52:06] see he said the one intellectually
[52:08] intellectually is a hungering with your
[52:09] brain with your brain you're just and
[52:12] your spirit you're just thinking about
[52:13] it and you you want something you you
[52:15] want it and he's feasting on God even
[52:18] but his his Feast doesn't hold out you
[52:21] know that's like somebody that had a
[52:24] good Evangelistic camp meeting and and
[52:26] they hear the word of God they're
[52:28] feasting on it they enjoy it and they
[52:30] maybe they'll run and Shout a little bit
[52:32] but then they leave and something hadn't
[52:34] anchored because it's just in their
[52:36] spirit in their head it's just in their
[52:38] brain but the other one the other that's
[52:41] got an experience something happened in
[52:43] their soul the other one seems to have
[52:45] Victory all the time there ain't nothing
[52:49] bothers them now now come on frame it
[52:51] right what he's saying there's plenty of
[52:53] things in life that bother you I I think
[52:55] sometimes being a
[52:57] uh being a Christian you know can be
[53:00] maybe one of sometimes the most sad
[53:02] experience the most full of the most
[53:03] heartaches full of the most trouble but
[53:06] yet there's nothing that bothers you
[53:08] nothing that bothers you you might not H
[53:10] be happy you may maybe all your
[53:12] happiness is taken away but there's
[53:13] nothing that bothers you because down in
[53:15] your heart you've got joy joy
[53:18] unspeakable and it was it will anchor
[53:20] you and carry you through all the all
[53:23] the ash heaps that job set on where
[53:25] maybe tonight you can look back and say
[53:27] I know what it's like to sit on an ash
[53:29] sheep cuz you've experienced it and
[53:31] you've been through it and you can be
[53:33] identified with that but you're just as
[53:36] solid and anchored as can be because
[53:39] you've got an anchor in your soul that
[53:42] holds and no trials and no storms
[53:44] bothers you at all and brother man would
[53:47] say that they seem to have something
[53:49] about them that people who are
[53:52] Christians and trying to live for God
[53:55] admire that type of
[53:57] Christian look how he framed that people
[54:00] who are Christians admire that type of
[54:03] Christians you know there's there's a
[54:05] lot of people that are Christians
[54:07] they're they're they're in the
[54:08] campground they they're in the in the
[54:11] court and they come and they're they're
[54:13] they're you know they're participating
[54:16] but they're just you know they they look
[54:17] like their life is a little bit shaky
[54:20] but then then there's other people that
[54:22] oh oh they're salty and and you it just
[54:25] makes you thirsty to look at their life
[54:27] and that's the kind of a life that we
[54:29] should strive to have the kind of a life
[54:31] that makes other people salty to make
[54:33] our kids want to be like that to make
[54:35] our our young people want to be like
[54:37] that that's why Jesus said in Matthew
[54:39] Matthew Chapter 5 ye are the salt of the
[54:42] earth but if the salt have lost its
[54:44] savor wherewith it shall be salted don't
[54:46] you want to be that kind of a Christian
[54:48] that's a salty Christian is somebody
[54:50] that shows love and kindness and respect
[54:52] to all
[54:53] people a a salty Christian makes Faith a
[54:57] priority a salty Christian gives freely
[55:00] of your time and your talents a salty
[55:04] Christian is hungering and thirsting for
[55:06] righteousness constantly oh you just
[55:08] want more of God and if you don't get
[55:11] nothing else out of this sermon maybe
[55:13] tonight just think I think about how
[55:16] much more of God you want if you want
[55:19] more of God there's more that be had to
[55:21] think how much more you want of God to
[55:24] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[55:26] and that's one of the on that Sermon on
[55:28] the Mount Jesus said if you hunger and
[55:29] thirst you're going to be filled you're
[55:31] going to get what you're hungering for
[55:33] what a blessing it is just to want it
[55:35] because there's so many in this life
[55:38] that could care less oh I I think that's
[55:41] one of the greatest curses there is to
[55:43] sit in a meeting to sit in a church
[55:45] where the truth is being preached and to
[55:47] not care that is that is truly a curse
[55:51] that is a curse upon this generation
[55:53] that's a curse upon this upon this age
[55:55] that we're living in where the gospel
[55:57] can be preached and people just turn a
[55:59] blind eye and not
[56:02] care fruit salt is showing compassion
[56:05] for the poor and putting other people's
[56:08] kns before your own and being a positive
[56:11] example to others and brother brand
[56:13] would say I've often wondered Lord what
[56:15] is it that these people have that others
[56:17] crave so much for and yet seem to fail
[56:21] to get
[56:22] it and he said many of our teachers in
[56:24] schools have brought in much the ology
[56:26] of telling the people well it's CA you
[56:28] didn't shout or CA you didn't speak in
[56:30] tongues or all these things but he said
[56:32] altogether you find these people when
[56:33] they do shout or speak with tongues or
[56:36] some other emotion they still don't seem
[56:38] to be the person that they should be so
[56:42] it's not how much you shout is it but
[56:44] let's not get rid of the
[56:47] shouting it's not how much emotion is it
[56:50] you can have aemotion or not have Emo
[56:51] motion and that won't prove what it is
[56:52] but let's don't get rid of the
[56:55] worship oh thank God for balance I don't
[56:58] want get I don't want to get rid of the
[56:59] worship just because it's not emotion I
[57:01] don't want to get rid of the shouting
[57:02] just because that's not how much you
[57:03] shout but it's something that takes
[57:06] place in your
[57:07] soul something that takes place in your
[57:10] heart and he said you truly have two
[57:13] different mental faculties you've got
[57:14] the one of them in your brain and the
[57:17] other is operated in your heart which is
[57:19] called your soul so it's your spirit and
[57:23] your
[57:24] soul I think think now what are you
[57:26] using right
[57:28] now what is it listen to this sermon I I
[57:30] preached sermons before where the pastor
[57:32] would come up behind me I preached this
[57:33] sermon one time uh just recently with
[57:36] the pastor come up behind me and he said
[57:38] well that was a sermon for your soul
[57:41] what does he mean by
[57:43] that sometimes you know you just get
[57:46] there's sermons preached that just kind
[57:47] of get you all excited right but then
[57:49] there's other times where a sermon
[57:52] really gives you something that'll
[57:54] anchor you and it's not just to get you
[57:56] worked up but it's to give you something
[57:59] that'll help you in your soul not just
[58:02] in your flesh or your spirit that's why
[58:05] Paul said bodily exercise profits a
[58:08] little it's great to get up and run
[58:10] around at church sometimes but something
[58:12] that'll anchor you and keep you is that
[58:15] correct teaching of the word the truth
[58:17] of the Gospel that will that will give
[58:20] you power against the devil overcoming
[58:23] power that when the Devil comes and
[58:25] tells tells you you ain't worth nothing
[58:27] you got something to throw back in his
[58:29] face when the Devil comes with all of
[58:31] his lies and schemes you've got the word
[58:33] of God to give it right back to him and
[58:36] just like Jesus did when he was tempted
[58:39] because that's how you'll defeat the
[58:40] Devil every time that's how you'll cast
[58:42] out Devils that's how you'll change the
[58:45] atmosphere of your home that's how the
[58:47] atmosphere in the church changes do you
[58:50] do you real if you think about that
[58:51] words have such a power that by the when
[58:55] the truth is presented it will actually
[58:57] change the atmosphere in the place that
[59:00] it's
[59:01] in isn't that true when you're sitting
[59:03] around at supper time and you begin to
[59:05] talk about Jesus then the atmosphere
[59:07] changes because the words that you speak
[59:10] have an
[59:13] effect and brother Adam said there's
[59:15] been things that's happened to you that
[59:17] you knew was going to be yet you could
[59:19] not explain
[59:21] why what are you using right now what's
[59:23] the difference between your soul and
[59:24] your spirit
[59:26] sometimes something happens down in your
[59:28] soul and your spirit's at odds with it
[59:31] and you wrestle with it you battle it
[59:33] out like Jacob and the angel and he'd
[59:35] say there's no reason you couldn't
[59:37] explain it out but yet you just accepted
[59:39] it and it happened just that way that's
[59:41] when something happens down here
[59:43] something down here when the doctor says
[59:47] I I don't think there's any hope but if
[59:48] there's something happened down there
[59:51] way down deep like an iceberg with way
[59:54] down under the water there's that part
[59:56] part that you can't see or like a ship
[59:58] that way down under the water there's
[1:00:00] that Rudder that's that's guiding the
[1:00:02] motion of the ship and you can't see it
[1:00:04] you can see what's happening on the deck
[1:00:06] of the ship but there's something
[1:00:08] happening underneath that controls where
[1:00:10] it goes and that's what your soul is
[1:00:13] your soul controls where you go what's
[1:00:17] going on under the water what's
[1:00:19] controlling your
[1:00:20] direction now you see the difference
[1:00:22] between and I'm not going to stay too
[1:00:24] late tonight it's already been 45
[1:00:25] minutes so I'm going to be closing just
[1:00:27] directly I'm not going to keep you long
[1:00:29] but let's let's meditate on this before
[1:00:30] we close what's the difference between
[1:00:32] your heart and your head your heart is
[1:00:36] going to be an
[1:00:37] experience I know cuz I've experienced
[1:00:41] it firsthand but your head is going to
[1:00:44] focus on all doctrinal Precision a
[1:00:48] accurate understanding let's make sure
[1:00:50] we articulate it right now now see what
[1:00:53] you can focus so much on correct
[1:00:55] articulation just like the Pharisees
[1:00:57] were trying to prove out or or maybe the
[1:00:59] early Christians that didn't understand
[1:01:01] the people of that day trying to
[1:01:03] understand what Jesus said about how you
[1:01:05] should be baptized now he said I got a
[1:01:08] quote I got a quote that he said we
[1:01:11] should be baptized in the name of the
[1:01:12] father Son and Holy Ghost well that's
[1:01:14] your head but your heart looks at things
[1:01:18] differently and your heart is going to
[1:01:21] have a close personal relationship with
[1:01:24] God there's that Clause that
[1:01:27] again you see that your heart your heart
[1:01:30] and everything your heart relationship
[1:01:32] with your wife if your heart's not in it
[1:01:34] you're just you're just going to end up
[1:01:36] glow slowly gr drawing apart until you
[1:01:39] both live on other sides of the house
[1:01:42] and you don't really care about one
[1:01:43] another anymore you're just friends but
[1:01:46] if your heart's in it it's something
[1:01:48] different you're United in that like the
[1:01:51] three parts of the house you've got the
[1:01:53] bedroom where you unite and uh real
[1:01:56] heart experience is going to be faith
[1:01:59] based in faith and trust I'm trusting in
[1:02:02] faith and my personal conviction in the
[1:02:05] word rather than some intellectual
[1:02:07] Ascent to doctrinal truths that somebody
[1:02:10] tried to teach me or somebody tried to
[1:02:11] tell me but I'm trusting in what I know
[1:02:14] to be
[1:02:15] true you see the difference sometimes
[1:02:17] that everybody wants we we'll get to
[1:02:20] this place where and I know we're all
[1:02:22] sheep and we got to have a leader and
[1:02:23] things but there's got to be a place
[1:02:25] where you come to where you know what is
[1:02:28] right or wrong and you are not trusting
[1:02:31] in just what somebody else tells you to
[1:02:33] do you got to have a Shepherd that tells
[1:02:36] you there's grass over here but there's
[1:02:38] got to come to a place where you know
[1:02:40] that this is grass and I want some more
[1:02:42] grass and you don't have to have
[1:02:44] somebody tell you and that's your
[1:02:45] personal experience your personal faith
[1:02:48] but in your head you're looking at it
[1:02:50] through reasoning and intellectual
[1:02:52] exploration you question everything
[1:02:54] every question about faith is is answer
[1:02:56] through debate and study and critical
[1:02:58] thinking and you just don't have a real
[1:03:00] experience for yourself see you can
[1:03:03] debate the the pillar of fire that Moses
[1:03:06] met all day long you can debate and
[1:03:07] argue about what what was happening was
[1:03:09] the bush really burning was the bush
[1:03:12] what kind of a bush was it and you can
[1:03:14] argue over those thing kind of things
[1:03:16] but when you have a real experience with
[1:03:18] God you know that that was God speaking
[1:03:20] to you from the bush like
[1:03:24] Moses that head looks at
[1:03:27] education it's got to study and work
[1:03:30] things out and and we all it's got to
[1:03:32] start from the head you're studying
[1:03:33] you're working things out but it's got
[1:03:35] to drop down into the heart where you're
[1:03:38] living out your faith through your
[1:03:40] actions that demonstrate love compassion
[1:03:43] and humility real love and compassion
[1:03:46] and real Fellowship not just an in
[1:03:49] institutional structure where you you
[1:03:51] just you're comeing to preserve and
[1:03:54] interpret and teach the doctrine of your
[1:03:56] particular place of worship oh that's
[1:03:59] not what God wants but God wants us to
[1:04:01] have a real
[1:04:03] experience oh think that that's that
[1:04:05] that's what church is about is having a
[1:04:07] real experience in your heart a a real a
[1:04:11] real alter call where somebody's heart
[1:04:13] begins to be moved and the tears begin
[1:04:16] to drop from their face and something
[1:04:18] begins to stir in their heart and they
[1:04:21] want some more of that they want more of
[1:04:24] God and and
[1:04:26] tonight as we're about to close we could
[1:04:28] ask that question is the Mana in your
[1:04:31] head or your heart when they were
[1:04:33] crossing the Red Sea and come over into
[1:04:35] the promised land god rained down Mana
[1:04:38] out of heaven and if they just let that
[1:04:41] man had lay just a little too long on
[1:04:43] the ground it would melt and run away
[1:04:46] just like frost or something on the
[1:04:48] ground it didn't hold and the next day
[1:04:51] they're hunting more hungry again and
[1:04:54] the same thing is happening today in
[1:04:56] Christianity he'd say many people before
[1:04:59] 9:00 get hungry again see cuz just
[1:05:02] because you receive some Mana from the
[1:05:04] Evangelist they got you all stirred up
[1:05:06] doesn't mean that you're settled just
[1:05:08] because you heard some good preaching
[1:05:10] for a little bit and you kind of got
[1:05:11] stirred up you can eat mana and be
[1:05:14] lacking now there's a mystery in it that
[1:05:18] you can eat mana and still be
[1:05:21] lacking that you can eat mana and it not
[1:05:24] hold
[1:05:26] that you can enjoy the Mana just like
[1:05:28] they did sitting there in the outer
[1:05:30] court with maybe all the unbelievers all
[1:05:33] the visitors coming through and eating
[1:05:35] Mana just the same and something not
[1:05:37] hold you can eat mana and be missing
[1:05:40] something you can eat the word of God
[1:05:42] and be missing something you can still
[1:05:44] eat you can eat mana and still be in the
[1:05:46] outer courts because it matters where
[1:05:48] you're eating
[1:05:49] at it matters where you're eating it
[1:05:52] makes a
[1:05:53] difference Jesus said he that hearth
[1:05:55] Heth my word and believeth on him that
[1:05:57] sent me hath everlasting life and shall
[1:05:59] not come into condemnation but has
[1:06:01] passed from Death unto life he that
[1:06:05] heareth my word not upon feelings or
[1:06:08] emotions or Theory some unknown
[1:06:11] something that somebody has said to you
[1:06:12] that has no basis but upon the word of
[1:06:15] God the human soul rests solid like Paul
[1:06:19] said in Hebrews 6 by two immutable
[1:06:22] things which hope we have as an anchor
[1:06:25] of the soul both sure and steadfast and
[1:06:29] which entereth into that within the veil
[1:06:31] something anchored down in your heart
[1:06:35] the difference tonight as as the
[1:06:37] musicians come forward and we'll just
[1:06:38] close on this note the difference is
[1:06:40] from your head to your heart something
[1:06:44] something that goes from being
[1:06:45] intellectual to Something Real down in
[1:06:48] your
[1:06:49] heart I want to lay that out for you
[1:06:53] tonight are you in that kind of a
[1:06:56] condition where you're eating mana and
[1:06:59] you're enjoying it but something just
[1:07:01] ain't anchored
[1:07:02] yet maybe it's time to get honest with
[1:07:05] God and watch the devil leave if you
[1:07:09] have need of something tonight we're
[1:07:11] standing by to pray for you and pray
[1:07:13] with
[1:07:14] you Paul said in Romans chapter 12 I
[1:07:17] urge you brothers and sisters in the
[1:07:19] view of God's mer Mercy to offer your
[1:07:22] bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:07:25] pleasing to God this is your true and
[1:07:27] proper wor Worship in Philippians
[1:07:30] chapter 1 he said for to me to for to me
[1:07:33] to live as Christ and to die is gain God
[1:07:37] wants us to just be honest about where
[1:07:39] our condition is and to give everything
[1:07:41] over to him why cuz God wants your head
[1:07:44] your heart he wants your heart
[1:07:47] tonight he wants you to love him as
[1:07:51] we'll stand to our feet and let's just
[1:07:52] worship
[1:07:53] Him and if you have a need
[1:07:56] we're happy to pray with you and pray
[1:07:58] for
