Douglas will be with us and then we'll be having the Thanksgiving uh dinner on the next Sunday which is 27th and we know that Brother Dean has gone down to his brothers and we forgot to announce this morning brother Aaron has gone up to brother Sparks to preach for him today so that's why he was missing you know today but we we thank the Lord for all things amen Matthew 5 in Romans 10. Matthew 5 Romans 10 . Lord Jesus we thank you thank you for everything father because we love you and truly when we hear that song about I love you Lord it rings deep into our heart and we just want you this day to realize that we love you and mother then if nothing else could be said we could just say that and go home Say I Love You Lord because you know from the depth of our hearts we mean that we're trying to talk about what you're trying to get to us yes why wouldn't we want to love you just have your way now lead us by thy Grace and understanding let your light shine in each one of our hearts forgive our sins leaders in that understanding years keep us in Jesus name Matthew 5. begin with verse 17. scripture turned on the wrong place I didn't want to read from there let's just go to Romans 10. we got from Matthew 5 we've been reading for for a while for some reason my Piper moved over so we was going to Romans because this is the main thing I want to get this afternoon Romans 10. let me just read verse 8 through 10. but what sayeth the the word is not thee even in thy mouth and thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus You Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thy shalt be saved for when the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made under salvation all right then we know that Matthew 5 48 says be therefore perfect right even as your father in Heaven is perfect and that's required you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word but I just want to continue on the thought that we were trying to bring this morning but what I want to do is I told you we I go through stages so we were taking about three services there to spit stick with the Old Testament Saints and then this morning we brought it up to Jesus Christ that's right all right and we brought it up to the point of what thou Hast the words of eternal life yeah and as I've ending up the point this morning saying see nobody had the words of eternal life sure they did in the bases that they were speaking of Christ coming right I mean it's all a foundation coming up but then a man walked on this Earth one day that had the words in his kind of life right had he not spoke there in The Parables you know showing the sower and the things we would have never known about eternal life all right that's right we would have never known about a savior and what are you doing I would invite you to read those scriptures Matthew Mark Luke and John because to me that is the Keystone to bring us to a place to understand that's right what happened it tells us what happened man was doing great and Jesus said you would have had a cloak for your sins have thou not come right that's it now you have no covering right all right amen he brought it out in the open he expounded upon it he magnified it brought it out the word that even our thoughts we were saying this morning would condemn us how can the human moral start the thoughts of perfection right all right now how would it be then that we could no wonder it's always been no way that Mankind's always said Nobody's Perfect oh yes we love to quote there's none good no not one have you ever looked at who said that the Lord Jesus there is none good no not one because there's nothing within any of us that we could ever think about the point of being perfect but God said we must be perfect right and we were saying this morning that our righteousness must exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees are we will in no wise inner heaven no that's a great thing to think about right when you're talking about people that never committed sin that's right as far as what would be known in their day of sin if you could they would be killed see then that way we look at it of what is perfection now this is what I want to point to stay in your mind today I just mentioned it this morning we'll read it in a minute the prophet said you're either perfect are you lost now do you understand that okay see we want to get into the great explanations of but not really brother Dale oh you're leaving out and you've always taught us that that you begin your salvation with justification that's right and then you must come through sanctification that's right we see that neither one of those are the new birth so then the prophet is we'll read it in a minute you'll see he's right right but your mind and your mentality will run that you mean if I know how the baptism of the Holy Ghost is I'm lost that's exactly right he said but I've come through justification I've come through sanctification that's true but neither one of them will give you eternal life right that's right not in this day now there was a day under Luther justification brought them to Newburgh under Wesley sanctification brought them to demand but he won't bring it to us today all right he said but I'm believing them too okay sure right if you're believing unto that's fine but believing unto literally means what you're saying you're believing unto right it means you're looking forward to something else it means like in the Old Testament that when they made an offering they were looking unto all right see thank God for the truth that's what I said when I hear that song I Love You Lord you know I told you years ago I raised my hands when I say I love you because that's the sign that I mean I'm telling him I love you if you don't know I love you you're in bad shape but I'm telling him I love you because see salvation is of the Lord amen now I want that in your mind before we read the quotes of the prophet that to think about see unless you are born again see then you are not saved you're not perfect he said well you just got through preaching to us that repentance made us perfect it does go to chops It Off now we're going to require something else see we're coming into a situation now that repentance can be perfect and you're perfect because you repented exactly right right amen that's wiped away that's right but that won't give you the new birth no right now listen what I'm saying that won't cover you all right come on go to Future home because you repent doesn't cover your future that's all right amen are you listening that's right amen that's why I want to cover just pick up this to go on with it see if you repent that drops off you buy sin the prophet said that has nothing to do with the future read it page 14 15 16 get your home that has nothing to do with the future because your sins are shut up because you're sanctified cleansing you that has nothing to do with future it's where you're at West Banks is gone right but when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost who's just as much that away no just as much by the way right right that's right because that's where you come to eternal life and that's where you come to really what you want to talk about being perfect right I was laying the foundation through the two matches you know to show you that God says under the atonement if you really offer that atonement sincerely not haphazardly we covered that right now just cause you throw the lamb down no but if you were really sincere God Chuck's healthy sins right right you stand perfect same thing then the animation in this day now right we're not talking about down in the ages now everybody with me yes so you you get something and you you've got to cover it because people's minds will run back and reverse that's right justification in the days of Martin Luther was the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth right right sanctification in the days of Wesley but it required in Wesley's day for you to be justified right right and then to be Sanctified right all right that was the new birth that gave them eternal life but neither one of them will give us eternal life today he would only be like an Old Testament just covered right you can't divorce sin you can't put it away it can because you won't answer that no more but the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth today all right it gives you eternal life yes like the words of eternal life have been made alive Jesus had the words of eternal life we read that this morning right right Peter said that it's because he said dark to Christ the son of the Living God that was a revelation unto it amen I didn't get into the new birth that did not give Peter the new birth just because he said that because you're going over you'll find out at Murray or not the one said the dark the Christ the son of the Living God also one of them even said the Christ of God I didn't give him the new birth see those were the days when it was just the words of eternal life but then it had to be revealed right and that's what happened on the day Pentecost the words of eternal life become Eternal right but I believe the new birth is the birth of the word all right see eternal life is not just a call or an idea he's eternal life right the word has been made alive in you right see then we went from this morning and said brought it up to Jesus he had the words of eternal life but that's all he could do was slow it down he could not give eternal life to it right the father's only revealer of the word so he couldn't reveal it run around and said Jesus said even my own life did not reveal that unto you now then see when with the death Pentecost Kenny he didn't make that word eternal yep that was so down in their heart right right that's why the scripture said Faith cometh by hearing and what and hearing by the word amen in other words the hearing of the word brings you to a recognition brings you to a state of understanding brings you to a place of saying I'm lost that's right brings you to a condition to where things can happen unto you but it doesn't give you eternal life right you can quote all the Bible you can quote all the message that doesn't give you eternal life it has to be the experience of eternal life all right the word has to be made alive like I was trying to say this morning at the end of it see for two years I studied the message and people were telling me you know this one brother's specialist one day said well what do you mean you're not born again did you believe the message well that that wasn't it that's why I believe there's not too many the prophet said new verse today right right you know why if people are taking a concept a thought or an idea instead of doing just what I told the brother this morning go confess yourself into it all right that's right if you need eternal life go confess yourself into it you need healing confess yourself into it all right say what God says because that's why we read Romans you believe in your heart that's wonderful right but you got to confess with your mouth it's a combination that's right see your mouth must say what your heart believes you say one thing with your with your mouth oh yes I believe Jesus I believe in being saved but it really don't matter how I live that's right now you can fashion drunk that's right don't come out of your mouth it wouldn't have compared to what was in your heart see then perfection then in this day when you're talking about perfection you're not just trying to talk about justification yeah that does Chop It Off and you don't have to repent no more of that that's our problem right how many of you would admit don't raise your hand you don't have to but that many of you would admit that you're still repenting what you've done 20 years ago 40 years ago 50 years ago right right that's right right Satan still brings up things you've done 30 years ago and you're repenting of it well I like that song what sins are you talking about if you repented God don't remember that that's right right we need to work on what we do now you know amen right because if you truly said I'm sorry for what you've done and you really mean it then God cleansed it right all right that's a form of perfection but that's not the Old Testament perfection all right those that put you not guilty right right yes that makes you not guilty but it doesn't make you eternal it didn't make them Eternal right right you see why we could spend months and much more on the point of trying to get it to you I wanted you to see that those Old Testament saints were perfect God said they were well because they were forgiven yes all right but then now to be as they were will not give you the new birth that's right that's right amen for sure Amen to be where Luther was won't give you the new birth to be where Wesley was won't give you the new bird but to be worthless this is the street Pentecost which was the New Birth that came do that makes you then perfect all right see then we'll go into it another message going down the line we'll go into the statue of a perfect man and we'll go into things you know I'm covering it how did that word does perfect does mean a full age right Etc but it meant the same in the Old Testament right it meant the same of Satan the same definition just a little different wording from the Old Testament perfect to the New Testament Word Perfect Satan was perfect yep because God created him perfect and that's right he can't create anything imperfect same word for you and I to get the new birth on you all right my father with me because I'm just trying to hit a point this is the finish of this morning see then Jesus had the words of eternal life amen right but there was no one at that place could comprehend what he was just saying that's right that's right they finally got down to the lies and said something he said you mean you now believe right all right the best they could do was what we were read during the scripture that we believe right that thou Hast the words of eternal life right you know that was the best they could do because you couldn't be born again Jesus came under the law to redeemed them or under the law Matthew Mark Luke and John is not the New Testament Jesus Christ came in the Old Testament yep dude that's what's real hard to get drilled into our minds because we've been taught all our life turned the first book of the New Testament everybody turn the Matthews has been instilled into your mind that Matthew is the New Testament and it's hard for me to convince you that it's not and then when I get you convinced to where I say turn to the first book of the New Testament you'll finally turn to the book of Acts why cause I'll beat you over the head too much with it until now you remember it but is it a reality that's it right amen see Jesus had the words of eternal life right and like I preached to you before if he had not have shown in us into the Earth right not in that ground he showed us the word and not a bride ready he said well she wouldn't even matter no but the word was saying right the word for sir but see the Holy Ghost couldn't fall on that word right that's right because the Holy Ghost has not been given the Bible says go Jesus had not been glorified right see they went away he could be glorified would it be crucified all right see then bringing it then to the New Testament under the word perfect with all of this in the background does somebody understand what I mean I know that that seems to be a a dry spot do you understand what I'm trying to get at the Old Testament Saints did not have eternal life in their soul because there was no way really animal life to be able to get back into the believer right right amen right right so there was no way for them to have eternal life in their soul right that doesn't mean that you're lost that doesn't mean that there are you know no hopes that means they were covered yeah and that's why they couldn't come up but when Jesus raised some of them could come up but not all of them right because there's a lot of them didn't have the faith it's like Jesus was seen a 500 Brethren after the Rapture the Bible called that on the 120 number huh what happened to 380. let's saw him oh if I had just been back there if I had just been back there I could have seen you might believe it you liar you got the devil on your mind instead of God's word we are what we would have been there if we are here with the word we would have been with the word then but if we're not on the word here we wouldn't have been with a word back there that's right it won't change us we are what we are that's right if you won't stand up for the word now you wouldn't have stood up for the word if he seems that night I want to love to sing brother Branham I would I would have loved to see him and been in the ministry there so you was that's wonderful but that don't give you eternal life all right I don't give you eternal life don't you solve the profit that's right I don't give you eternal life cause a prophet get you thus saith the Lord you're healed or whatever you know things happen I don't give you right is when you receive eternal life right all right so you're not sure we have to pick up in the New Testament you're trying to work bring the word perfect but let's don't take it so high that was the purpose of using the Old Testament as examples right that you could look back there and see them but a man like Noah yeah you know good be called perfect and die of drunk right right well he got on perfect there ain't no thing being we'll get to it the minute bro said you're either a saint or you're not he said there's no such thing as a black white bird right so God is not going to say about Noah in one verse and he's perfect in the next verse say he's a bad guy right right and next verse he'll tell you what he done all right Don't Call Him a bad guy right amen that's my point moved in into the New Testament keep the same shouting your channel of mine that did repentance today won't bring you the new birth right right man it takes the person of Jesus Christ to come amen now I'm not saying that you can't come right up here and say right here and go through justification say in case the baptism it all goes at one time I'm not going to tell you that because it can happen right but it would be a very very very very very very very very how many more varies do I need rare occasion right right right amen it would be something that would be can be done but probably call them Paradox is that the word for him to use or something you know can be done right that's why you can't tell them say well come up here and be justified then go back come back and do something no because it might come up and go through it all at one time right that's left to the person all right but on the biggest percentage then I know people even tell you they'll say you're not supposed to tarry for the Holy Ghost well the Bible said he did right yeah you don't have to try and just take it well where you gonna take it what are you gonna do we'll just receive it yeah I'm sorry to not have a good memory and that's what gets me about some of you you know we'd be talking and you'll say I seen that right off when I heard it the first time I believed it and I'm thinking I wish I didn't think I'm thinking it took me about three years to get that one thing drilled into that person thank you they're saying I just got an old one why don't you get it one time why you know just just receive it I received it just like that in anything you know you want to take them and say don't pray for the person you're telling them a lie yeah but that ain't nice I try not to be that away you know but I'm just telling you the truth I never told nothing I thought was the lie I said I just try to tell you the truth about it all right it was two years and I was confessing before God gave me the new birth well you sure I agree with you um but I'm a bad guy it just takes a long time to get through to me but you know what he does get through all right he has been able to get through and bring me through all of it you know it's all right brother Mo had a dream about me one time and he told me and in his dream he he seen me and you know he we're going somewhere and I don't remember what he said he was in like a car or something he's got there he said look around like a message here I come ride the bicycle but you know what I got there I might have been a whole lot slower or according to his dream you know all right but I'm just telling you that part because listen but when you come into receiving Jesus Christ as your savior have you received the person of the word right you've heard the word you've talked about the word you sung about it you confessed it but have you really received the person and the word right right that's it and then what I'm saying this morning right at the end where the prophet of God said that those great things to him was a revelation right did he see a vision so you're going to run a ground after a while you can run okay with it but then somebody comes along like me to say oh but what about brother run said when you come to the third bullet with no vision then we know nothing he said something just told him whatever you have need of he didn't see a vision of squirrels he said whatever you have need of you say it and it'll be to her it was a revelation the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ Mr God revealed personally to you I think it's Faith 45 personally to you where he spoke right to you all right yeah I've heard people say well I think I got the Holy Ghost because the preacher said I did well put that what if the preacher back for you Nia wondered what he was saying it right why he was getting it or not you know right right but you see that way we're building up on something we want somebody to tell us something we want somebody to tell us what this message is the brother asked me to write down Daniel 70 weeks I said brother don't know me making me right that you can hear the tape if I wrote it down you wouldn't be because you couldn't rule down first no leave it all life and yesterday when we said the notes back there for the for the wedding you know because we I was trying to get it back to work keep it inside my Bible where it looks odd you know it's like downsizing it and writing it real small thing and they looked at it and I said you think you can read that and they said no I said I can't eat it when it gets cold but if it's true you know but listen I believe then the new birth is a birth of the word the words you've heard that's why you've always got to hear that's right how here we you know and how is it that you can't hear you can't hear without a preacher right we'll bless God I didn't hear no preacher I was listening to the prophet what do you think he wouldn't appreciate it I was just reading the Bible what Paul said will you think Paul wasn't a preacher yeah amen you see it sounds good don't it but when you analyze it do you have eternal life man if you do you don't have to worry about doctrines your ideas right sure we can have problems yeah okay how's your healing that's right but how can the Holy Ghost agree with a false Doctrine that's right I told the sister that one time and I said if I had no other thing as an Evidence of the Holy Ghost than the fact that he's kept me away from everything I said I would shout like glory and say I've got the new birth because something killed me why don't you think that away right yeah but I want to do that sorry God allows you run around and said he said you lay under the spout long enough then you'll come through speaking in tongues that's right well you know I've been on this about 40 something years and ain't never spoken tons yet I'm Amish do you think you come along and say well we spoke in Newtons because you changed your language well that's okay but that's still not what I wasn't talking about I ain't smoking trouble right what am I going to put into the house that smoking talk to me because I'm not born again I'm not gonna put a cat away right how amen look coach of Pentecostal he said you ain't got it you remember what running around run into the two guys you know in his first Minister it to Jesus name you know when I was speaking Tom's other interpret she's come up on one of them said he's genuine Christian dope on the other one said he's a hypocrite he said one of them said if you ever spoke in tongues he said no city grew with it you ain't got it you can Bank on one thing that was the hypocrite that wasn't the guy that really had it right right right because that's what's so hard to try to say now to you the the point I'm trying to get across right when we read where the Prophet says you're either a Christian or you're lost all right now A lot of people are in the stages of justification it's just repented amen right is the prophet saying they're lost like the word lost totally gone no but he's saying you're not born again yet right right and he'll even says it's your if you die in that state you're going to heaven you want them close right so you said it said you were going to heaven if you die in that state because you're believing unto amen but he didn't say he was in The Bride that's right he didn't say he was born again that's right so that's why it's so hard is to try to tell you now to get to a point and say hold it now the prophet of God has got to be right amen because you're either lost or you're saved all right that's right when I'm in between no they ain't going to win between you may be in between all right but there is no in between God don't count the in between he counts it that he could even send you to heaven as a foolish virgin right but you're not listening what he's saying you're either born again or you're not in Black right amen amen he says in one of these quotes we'll get to it in a minute he said you're either born again or you're not going to heaven now Analyze That we're supposed to go then brother Dale they don't want to happen right yeah but you conjured out a prophet because he said if you're not born again and you said the food is burned is not born again because there's going to be a lot of people in heaven you have any trouble so then when he's saying you're either lost or you're saved he's not making gray areas he's telling it like the Bible says right but now there might be a lot of us in Gray areas Lewisburg is going to heaven one day right right because they're going to be giving eternal life but you know what now let me say it brother Dave's language the foolish version is not going to heaven without eternal life fun all right okay wait a minute what do you mean I mean they're going to the white Throne judgment to receive eternal life and then they go to heaven right they can't go to heaven without eternal life that's right right they ain't going to heaven and get eternal life that's right so now we're right right see people hear me say something make a statement Lord look what he's saying all right I'm trying to express what the prophet had said to us and doing my job and he said the preacher's supposed to take it break it down all right like I said this morning about to run across there what run around and said run it across without stopping to emphasize for a long period of time or putting in for instance and it looked just like he's saying something wrong I'd have been doing that I'd put it in princess but they're just trying to translate words around and say let's band and address the third person of the trinity oh my that's a direct quote really random I didn't think you believed in the Trinity I don't well why did you say that well I said word confuse everybody else I guess the best way you did that but are you listening and then we get on to what we're trying to talk about so then when you're coming into the New Testament now remember on the day of Pentecost anybody with me not a sister Street it'll be your son but on the day of Pentecost in the Bible you had to be justified Sanctified before you could be filled with the Holy Ghost there wasn't nobody in the upper room that wasn't Justified and Sanctified that received the baptism of the Holy Ghost now see that's where when I start talking people they dry up only because they know that what I just said right they just don't agree with it but just explain it some other way well how did them people go through that don't ask me I know they were three years in Mountain High walking with the Lord Jesus and brother Brown said that made them Justified and Sanctified and listen I even know how to quote he said that was only potential do you want that one Peter and them were only potentially Justified to Sanctified oh really right sure but they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah because the reason it was potential is because Jesus Christ hadn't made a way yet the way wasn't made perfect so it was potential right that's right Earnest if you want to call it right right they were Justified and Sanctified come on but your Prophet said it was only potential because Jesus Christ did not die only after the death of Jesus Christ can you come through justificated the same case the baptism I'm gonna hold up that's right when Jesus Christ died that place them that was potential okay potentially Justified and Sanctified when he died and they believed it went in that upper room that was no longer potential right the way was made the Holy Ghost could fall they fell on them that believed the word the 100 380 didn't make it right I ain't saying they didn't make it later never I said you didn't make it later right because they were called Brethren right that's what it says in the Bible it was three up 300 500 Brethren maybe they went on they didn't received the Holocaust they didn't get enough room right right me all right that new birth in the upper room didn't make a bunch of blabbering babies as everybody thinks that's right it made them with a statue of a perfect man to right here and I point to it where it says the Holy Spirit because they didn't get to Hitch them right right that's what your Prophet said well if it didn't get the headphones it didn't get the Holy Ghost well that's why he put right there Holy Spirit right here man it's The Headstone of love amen he said The Headstone did not come yet and but it was enough to bring them into the body of Christ amen all right it may then them sealed in as the faith of the father right but the five thousand or three thousand that received it in just a little while after them that's right they didn't make it up here they didn't make it up here they made it right here right right they were born again in faith how could they be born again even higher than that because they only heard one sermon but you know what that one sermon done it put them through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under one sermon so I said I'm not going to tell somebody that you can't do it you know now come on don't you you get in with me it didn't this when when the Holy Ghost fell on the death Pentagon it didn't just justify the people and then they might have to go they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter says to Peter that says the house forbid we've been by sin they receive the Holy Ghost like we they received a new birth right that's where people can't follow brother Run's message and he'll say I met people that had to Holy Ghost 50 years before I did he said exactly like the book of Acts later now the baptism of the Holy Ghost the same as the upper room experience right go to that and heard the word right right see the Holy Ghost can only quick and what's in you and that's why there's not so many new births why gonna happen you bring a New Birth by preaching false Doctrine right right just one that we need the words of eternal life we need to realize this message now I can preach to people about the new birth right where in Brazil we all got it we're just waiting on you to get it well okay one of these days I'll get it we'll all happen blessing I just don't believe it that way or I wouldn't be preaching this to me I'd just be at home studied myself right I'll be sitting down listening to somebody else that's what I've always said it took a good old Baptist I've talked to Pentecostal preachers they knew no more about the New Birth then when you in the Baptist Church the only difference was we believe they shouted we believe they spoke in tongues right listen church I'm just trying to get something to cross but if I don't get into these notes I don't worry about nothing I got plenty of time but you're either perfect or you're lost all right then when we read these things don't get all tangled up with it that's right that's right well I don't I don't know whether I'm saying or not within you're lost right yeah because we just read that's right you believe in your heart and your mouth says what's in your heart it's not believing your heart I think I'm saved right maybe I am I read the message of the hours so that means I got to that's not the evidence okay that's right no move the only evidence you're probably never put yourself on was one thing right whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right amen right right now if the spirit in me will keep on agreeing with the word I know for certain it's not the Holy Ghost all right you don't have to tell me I know myself but I'm trying to get to point to you to where you won't be confused later and then we read it and then you're you're fumbling backwards and forth in your mind and I thought the prophet said she went to lie I thought it was this way I thought it was anyway well get up tell me your thoughts tell me what eternal life is I'll be glad to sit and listen to you my brother Davis just believe the message let's Baptist right well I shot it that's meant to this costume I said Hail Mary that's happening right I believe everything the prophet said that's all of them put together amen right but you know yourself because a lot of you have been around at least 20 years and you know yourself even in the past 20 years you've seen a lot of these old heads that was in the message fall off after Doctrine that's right oh yeah I'm sure you know that right well evidently they didn't know the Holy Ghost well who are you to be judging I'm me who are you I get away from that saying who are you Jr and I'm Sue Ellen or whatever you know so that was an old statement made years ago off of a movie goat it simply means who you think you are you're judging my my one rotten apple by your whole bushel it's rotten you want another languages or whatever I'm just trying to get down this honestly talk to you do you really see that under the New Testament then where we're at today we're back to the Pentecost Lutheran M could be justified and be born again of this day that's right we are to return to Pentecost Azusa Street where the people likes it or not Azusa Street run around said was the baptism of the Holy Ghost even calls it be profit amen 464 single book the prophet came himself in the fullness in the baptism he said that's right see we don't want to quote them when I just can't sing well I don't care what you can't see I don't care what I can't see what does God say amen if he says I'm perfect I'm perfect you argue the point with it but if he says that I'm not perfect I'm not perfect I have no argument right man I've got his word right what do you see what I'm talking about so now when we read these get your mind into this state of what I'm talking about now when the prophet says you're either a sinner or a Saint you're either saved or you're lost and if you're not saved you ain't going to heaven right get all of that foolish virgins and all of those things out here die behind you get it down to what he said Is Right the Bible don't Define foolish virgins it does work it puts it in the scripture you understand what I mean but it doesn't break it down the Bible don't make one thing putting us to heaven in another law what I told you every foolish version that ever goes to heaven is one day going to receive eternal life and to watch your own judgment right so then nobody's going to heaven without eternal life is that Central right yes yes what else would be said that's why I love him because he can show it to us and he shows it to me to be able to break it down to keep you from being confused about it I'm sorry that I take a long time and some of you get all hooked up and everything else because you don't like it cause I take a long time but you don't remember when I was taking a long time to try to help you is that plain enough why can't you battle with somebody else if you have eternal life you can bear with anybody do if you get what you well okay let's go let's read some of them all right brother Joe go ahead and put it up laughs look what he said haven't you heard this is from the Mason the Lamb's Book of Life 1956. haven't you heard many times that people say oh that was none perfect that's right oh wait a minute you just said that there's none perfect this is what he said you've heard people say many times that people say there's nothing perfect you want to race that out where's that that's right now because that's what he say that's right you can't be perfect in the side of your fellow man but you've got to be perfect or you'll never go to heaven that's right the Bible said Jesus speaking into beatitude Matthew said be therefore perfect even if your father in Heaven is perfect I'm gonna get back there while I realize and find out why I wrote that in Matthew 5 13-24 I'll read that later see when I wrote it down because that's what I had on my notes read all right then you've got to be just as perfect as God is are you lost now how are you going to do it see now one little mistake and you're lost one little flap of the eye and you're gone cause nothing can enter into have to to those places but perfect so you can't go to heaven unless you're perfect and we don't realize and establishes everybody never gets to have it's going to be perfect that's right oh the problem going to the next one the queen of sheep in 1958 I don't agree now this is doing what he's saying he's talking about unbelief is one of the most hideous things that can strike a person and there's only two faculties that can never can govern you that's either face or unbelief you cannot be halfway between there's no black white birds or drunks over men Center Saints you're either a Believer or not a believer I'm the only sin that there is is unbelief that's right see now we're going to stop okay you're a believer in unbeliever I might there's a lot of people in the world it's between those two right they're not a Believer enough to be born again but they're religious enough to not be a sinner right right I want to listen that's why I see these things need to be explained to your mind that's right right because there isn't a lot of people that fits between being a Believer or not a Believer you said well brother damn I heard this message I believed it how much do it but don't you believe a whole lot more today yes amen yes you see then you say well then people are unbelievers you never heard me say this unbelievable you never heard me say people leave this church in an unbeliever right right are they left the word no that's for their decision to make it ain't mine that's right no you're an either believer or an unbeliever right now remember this is what God is looking at he makes no difference because he's looking at it as there is no white bird there is no drunk sober man that's right there is no believer that's an unbeliever so we're either Believers or unbelievers the only sin there isn't unbelief that's right you see what I'm talking about see you just say well brother so-and-so preach tonight it's really enjoy the more glad I just shouted young he read around on top of some of these things and you never heard a word to say it yeah tell me what he said I don't know but it was good all right well man showed me a picture one day you showed me a picture and he'll look like that now you are gay I said ain't a bit of Truth on the page but it's a pretty picture you want me to draw you a pretty pitch he didn't even think to look at it to see what it was saying right it was just beautiful to him you seen the one where the guy you know that we talked about where he got this Pillar of Fire up here and then you got everything jumped over here and this jumps over here and that jumps over there everybody's looking at her oh look at that it's wonderful ain't a bit of truth to it amen we get everybody just glories in the pictures come on folks right be sensible me you see their faith or unbelief you cannot be Highway between all right you can't be well I really don't know you know I really don't know a lot well that's okay if it's been revealed one time in your saved you're saying one little thing right because that way the most illiterate person and I love that right amen most illiterate person can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't even know what their names are but God could drop down in their heart and give them the new birth take that person through justification of baptism in my Holy Ghost right amen and give them the new birth look what he said leave that in that brother Joe just to me is that the same one I wonder if this quote the last one you might be ever so religious you can never tell a lie you might be such a church member did all the neighborhood would say that's a renowned person and still be a sinner in the Son of God you're not judged by that it's by your faith not judged by your life you see what he's saying it's your faith he didn't believe it none is condemned already wonderful people out there that go to church every day and love God and would do a whole lot more than we do for God now brother Dale you're telling me about I've explained it yes they can be foolish virgin right but as far as right now they're lost now that's what you don't like because you don't like for me to say that like one brother told one time he said brother Dale said I didn't have the Holy Ghost I didn't say didn't I never did that come out of my mind I said the way you act shows you don't have it right he went away from your left his place said the brother Dale said I didn't have the Holy Ghost well if he'd had it he wouldn't have left right you'd say well you didn't never did say no I'm just saying it you didn't have to Holy Ghost he'd still be here because he'd know what I said was right right if you got the Holy Ghost today these quotes won't make you get upset you'll say Amen to what the Bible and the prophet had to say about it amen it won't change it that way look at the next one debate on tongues there's no black white bird no drunks over man did you see the right where's wrong I really disappointed carefully it it you can't have error and Truth together now let that soak in a minute you can't have error or truth together it's either truth or it's era when I wrote it down I don't know do you play it you think you know everything no but what I know as far as I understand is true did you see what I said what I know is true right amen so it's not neither it's whether you got it or not because people want people don't know the mansion you can't ever ever you see the truth do you believe that don't you brother and certainly if the spirit is Right a scripture is right then let's stay with the scripture you're going to understand after church you're trying to stay with the church you know bye what do you see what he's saying how can you be born again by somebody preaching era now come on I know God can winking ignorance and do what he wants to say right we know that but it's all in him look at the next one ten verges which is 144 000. 1960 12 11. and remember we're going to deal on that shark limb this morning you're either in that body or out of that body there's no pretty good Christian that's right and and dire you're either Christian or you're not Christian there's no black white bird no drunks over man you can't have it you're either a Christian or not a Christian you're either in Christ or out of Christ I'm not de-christianizing anybody is that what you think he's not gonna be christianizing people all right why can't you read what he says to say what he said on that one you know where are we then like I said this morning oh yes I've never heard of anybody that said right around was wrong on marriage and divorce yeah yeah I'm talking about when he gave the grace you ever heard anybody just walk up since he was wrong right there nope boy they want to believe that yeah it didn't say he was wrong on the other look at the next one 6-03-63 323 and you remember the whole thing is based on two things one is and one and Antichrist the other one crashed so now we're sitting here today we're either Christ by the new birth or Antichrist I'm blessed God I'm not an antichrist well that's what your Prophet had to say so argue with him well he didn't mean it that way I just read it it's still the same thing okay there is no Highway Christian there's no drugs over none man no black white bird no no no Senator Saints no you're either a sinner or a saint see there's just no in between you're either born again or you're not born again you're ready to filled with the Holy Spirit are you not filled with the Holy Spirit no matter how many Sensations you had if you ain't filled with the Holy Spirit you're not filled with it see and if you had been filled with it your life shows it goes right up to it see nobody has to tell anybody about it they see it amen no just gorgeous look at the nature go away Jesus 63 1103. but when we're condemned with unbelief sin of any type sin is unbelief there's only two types two things that every person in the world is living by did you hear that one every person in the world is living by one of these two maybe it's either Faith or unbelief there is no hide way between there are no drug trouble man tonight there's no black white birds tonight and there's no sooner saying he's either born again or not born again where you believe and we don't believe right amen amen bless God you think you know everything you think is not it I'm just saying that where I'm standing in the Lord that's perfect that's all I'm saying I'm saying the new birth makes you perfect amen because you're not a sinner if you are what are you well you mean every day all right did you say it or say he disbelieved God's word a lot got to be said about Sin man Jesus said show me one thing that I didn't fulfill the word you want me to find them we brought around he said show me where I ever missed the word all right what was he talking about seeing then natural life and things we do every day because in God's eyes that's sin because my Bible says anything's not a faith it's sin right whether it be eating too much or whatever all right spiritual amnesia 1964 411. you must be identified somewhere you must show your live shows tonight where you're identified you're identified either in Christ or out of Christ right you are not high not halfway there is no such thing as a drunk sober man there's no black white bird you're either saved or you're not saved you're either a saint or a sinner one or the other and your spiritual attitude towards God's word identifies you exactly where you're standing what is it look at the next one I normally read a lot today but I want you to see these things right around and said you people don't want to hear these things now watch it be therefore perfect there's one scripture and wrote around and said they were perfect back there and the other day remember I was bringing out the scripture where we think that we got well I got you trapped number of them because the Bible says that the worshiper was not made perfect you remember that one I brought around and puts them both together come on no sacrifices which are offered year by year never made to Comer unto perfect now he's using that scripture then he turned around and he says Jesus in Matthew Saint Matthew's gospel said be there for perfect evening your father in Heaven is prayer how are you going to do it how can you do it how can you be perfect as god is perfect be as perfect as God is prayer but that was a commission or a commandment made a commandment by Jesus Christ to be as perfect as God is in heaven Mercy do you say looking beside listen to it hold it just a minute let's find out how that Perfection is made now God back there in the beginning when he forced all down through this streak of time and he knew they would have to have a remedy to save those which were designed to be saved those who hungered to be up there in that realm he had to make a way to redeemed those people back again and we read one this morning where he made the way to his own blood right I think this is the one yeah the next one is one that gay this morning on perfection come on up with the next one it's the same one we gave this morning but anyways he predestined the name of the church to me give me under without a spider rim and if a garage required a church without smarter wrinkle he had to have something to make it that way he could not require his Justice his judgment could not let him ask such a thing if there wasn't a way to make it he made it to his blood how did he make it that day on Calvary it's in 1969-25 hungry he made a way he gave us the spirit the holy spirit that sent it back to the Earth for you and I to live by that's what Calvary means to us to follow him and we're going down looking at the lives you either accepted or rejected therefore there is no sin Shackled hanging on us at all God just like we had never seen what about the psalmist David that would say under the blood of bulls and ghosts right blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin think about that not scripture you know if he said it must be somebody that's right you sure was a bad egg now with me an adulteress a murderer or what all kind of things you could say about it it's an iPhone but he was once said because he was standing under the atonement there's no shackles or nothing the perfect sacrifice made us perfect for Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect then there is no more to be done but we're made perfect in the presence of God what do I do go down to the next in the last book of life now you got to be perfect you said being there for perfect even as your father name and it's perfect now how are you going to be when you're continually sinning when you're continually doing what's wrong oh you wouldn't denying our problems of doing things he said how are you going to do it when we're doing it now this will kind of put a little kink in the legalism but notice it isn't what you do if what God has done it's not what you do it's what he done see you can't be perfect you can't be in yourself but in Christ you are perfected you're not trusting in your own good works right or your own church you belong to but you're crushing into shed blood of the Lord Jesus there you are that's what makes you perfect that's what anchors you in faith being in Jesus Christ bypass the next one number 12 God is just a token and the worshiper underneath the sacrifices the token that you know and that's what it's believed but Iran says you can't not on this quote here but he said you can't impute sin over the token well it's my face happened I'm trying to hurry look at the next one which is 19 and number 13. law or Grace preach 1954. 1005. well I hope you see it it is whether you're going to be a Christian or not listen it's whether he was good enough it's whether he was good enough I love the way your your Prophet talks you know he talks about English just like we do right right if God accepted him and his blood makes an atonement God don't see you he sees the lamb he talked about the little me you know going out and dancing around I remember his mama told him he said God ain't looking at you you're looking at your sacrifice he's going to live but one person had to die for the imperfect that was me William Brown no good not fit to live where did it go to hell born and sinful family raised a sinner no good at all not one sound part about me that's right but one day I accepted Hallelujah when God looked down on Christ and Christ took my place then God don't see me he said the perfect one then as long as I'm in here in him that I am perfected not in myself in him not my perfection I don't have any you don't have any it's it but it's his Perfection right amen I'm looking at me looking at him let's get the last one like in the infallible word of God 56 406. and you can't be perfect but as long as you're in Christ you're perfected by his vicarious suffering and death of the cross God doesn't see your sins he sees nothing but one perfect person the body of Jesus Christ he came that's the reason they love the hard prophet thought surely God would curse Israel but look at the things they had done wrong but he failed to see the smitten Rock in the right serpent going before him make an atonement God couldn't see through the atonement his blood the answer is flesh what do you think about it are you perfect or just forgiven God says we're perfect that's right by the new birth the prophet says in other words just paraphrase it even with the new birth you and I every day do wrong and remember this morning when I was trying to explain about job knew he'd done what God told him to do but he didn't see Christ right so when is whenever you came to him and condemned him for being self-righteous he ain't condemning for the fact that he was saying what was right he condemned me for being self-righteous because he thought he could do it and had done it in himself right isn't that self-righteousness but when he seen Jesus Glory when he seen the Redeemer you realize what a sinner he was I've tried my best to explain Paul oh man imagine I thought what was I thought this was life he said I found it to be death that's right what was he talking about keeping the law to the perfect letter a Pharisee the Pharisee a Hebrew the Hebrews blameless he said read it concerning the law blameless but he said what I thought was life I found to be dead see he couldn't see Jesus right that's right come on don't you see what I'm talking about Doreen I keep bringing it up he was like job he was like Joe he couldn't see the retainer because he didn't think he needed me run around the birthday and said it was hard to get those Pharisees to realize they're Sinners where he could die for them amen what about it Paul walking in a perfect state could not be condemned by the law perfect blindness but one day he said I thought this was life he said I now see it's death I don't want to be found in him not having my own righteousness but the righteousness as he said that comes by faith that's right see when he seen Jesus he realized what it was to be a sinner and he made a statement that's outstanding brother Connie condemned me years ago for saving it I said I'm the chiefest of Sinners he said brother Dale ain't never been out there to live like we did in the world I sit down here brother Dave was walking close there's the guy that could say he's the chiefest right when you're walking very close and alive until I received this new birth until I seen Christ I thought I had it or you listening yes I thought I had it I thought my life proved ahead I didn't drink I didn't smoke I didn't curse I didn't do anything concerning the Bible blameless right you can say oh you're putting your own horn and I'll just telling the truth respected looked up to my people because 23 years old I was an ordained Deacon in a matter that never puts a deacon into a 40. but they don't want them young Hot Heads in there teaching their adult Sunday school class the deacons and the elders and their wives let's see one day I like Paul yeah it's all that what I thought was life going to church being good paying my time and we never got up on Sunday or we going to church well the kids got a sniffly no let's all stay home happy boy you know what I'm telling you God's honest truth money how do you feel today well I still feel like going well let's just don't go I had more than that and I was in the Baptist Church now you can condemn me you can scream and holler at me and say brother Dale's hateful old guy you just don't understand my problems this order's made for praying for the sick your home is not made for praying for the sick do you understand that statement yes I never read in the Bible call the Elders to come to your home that's fine if your chicken can't come but you know yourself this man's been here for years and you've seen me through many sicknesses and many my trials and trouble but it's never been a day that I didn't come to church well you just went as sick as I am I told you years ago still stand on it the reason a lot of people are never healed they don't want to be healed they'd rather be sick where they can go out there I'm not going around jumping like this my knees killing me my back hurting I need to send praise the Lord how you doing I'm doing wonderful foreign the people out there might not understand that but you know it's true there's ever been a time I missed Services because of being sick church is where you're supposed to be when you're sick right now you come up here with some quarantined disease will put you downstairs but we'll give you if you can watch your services but I wouldn't care if you come shut the side of me all right amen I wouldn't care if you come here and stood on the platform with me with a deadless disease it could be I wouldn't be afraid that's right right you're a dummy I agree with you but I wouldn't be afraid okay yeah that's where you say brother they don't know I've been in them places and you've seen me walk out of them listen to church I can say like Paul fun the thing I thought was life going to church being good paying my time working myself to death I thought that would laugh because you see I could quote Paul and say poor old Paul he just didn't know that he needed to be born again all he had to do was believe I believe and he didn't Oh Heaven help you but you see I seen one day what I was doing was death and I started crying out to God for life but how many of you have ever thought of it even in that form that where you come from was death that's right so then I have to explain those are wonderful people those were good people thank God for them and Annette Brown never condemned them he said there's a place for him but that's not for you and me the law was fine for the other people but Paul said it on it for me he said now I take my ways five times and all the stripes in the deep and all these other things can't you look back at him and see the old Old Testament prophets and what they went through the only to speak of what was in their life with Paul trying to get the people to see Jesus he said they said oh even God warned Paul through the holy spirit said don't go right he said because they'll kill you read your Bible in the book of Acts Paul was warned by the Holy Spirit not to go he said I'm not only we'll let you go I'll go it I'm going to roll to give our life the man like Peter said don't hate me the way they did my master hang me upside down why because he had a more sure word that's right thank you I said Peter there he said I have more sure word I saw Jesus on the mountain I saw all these things when I got a more sure word of Prophecy that's right I've got the new birth now can't you see it you see why I love it I don't but I saw it was right till I come in this message and I've seen I didn't have what the Bible said what everybody else is I come in this magic to prove I got the Holy Ghost going to come to the message I'm sorry maybe I'm the only one in the world that's messed up like it would I don't mean that sarcastically I mean this is true but thank God he got a hold of it thank God he was able to contact me to tell me he said you wasn't born again all right I told you I saw God when I was 11 years old but that didn't mean I'd want it again I've seen things in my life that would that most people would put on there to say you had to have a new birth but I never claimed it you see that's why I'm trying to preach to you what the new birth is it's not your shot who's speaking in tongues all of that comes after babies born yep right it's not the baby the baby got to be born for a cries we agree with all of those things we believe in all of the gifts I encourage you to use your guilt that you have within you and you'll answer to God for not using your guilt see I'll have to answer for not allowing you to use them and no one year has ever done it one man here started doing something one time and some of them guys said something about it I said they ain't doing nothing but speaking in Spanish and I never knew a word of Spanish you got mad at me but you know what it proved later that's right what about a jerk you're either a Christian or you're lost you're either saved or you're lost you're either born again or you lost there is no gray area well brother Dale I just come in today and heard it what can I do thank God and get justified by everything and then leave on sanctification right and then come to the baptism when the Holy Ghost deep because that's what you need to do I got an extra stand together we'll just go right on the end of the community I'm sorry for being a little late maybe one of these days I'll learn to preach slower advice or something and quit you know something anyway but I just want you to see what the New Birth really is and you must be born again and just believing is not enough even sanctification is not enough the new bird when we went to so-and-so and and the more they when they were praying for somebody to receive the Holy Ghost they just shouting all over the place well why wouldn't you shouting this morning while I was praying for the brother you want to condemn me what's the matter you know like it that way do you if the people were shouting all over the church or people were shopping all over the church I've been in many places where people were shouting all over the church and I pray the same prayer and I pray right here and that's starting to feel that person with a bad kid while ago you don't have to you don't have to beat people over the head and Hammer them around for another season anyway just tell them it's for her all they got to do is accept it that's right may take a while to accept it brother Dale do you mean you encourage people to no I didn't I don't encourage you to wait two years to get the Holy Ghost I ain't never said that I said that is me because I'm kind of slow but I'll tell you one thing according to the Bible and according to the prophet we're either Christians or we're lost we're either saved or lost we're either born again or not born again we're either perfect or we're not perfect I just got through reading all of the quotes the prophet didn't say surely he knew what the new birth was surely he knew the situation of mankind what do we think about well I know somebody who's a real good Christian but they don't believe it's naked I just can't do telling you it's wonderful people Lori Hallelujah thank God for him but if they don't believe this message you know there's something wrong that's right that's right because the Holy Ghost I believe this last year right absolutely I don't you tell me president you believe everything right around said I believe all that I know he said but I ain't heard everything he said and you know what if one of these days I find something that the spirit in me don't agree with what he said you know what I'm gonna come out here and tell you I don't believe this that's what means I've been lost all this time right I have no problems with saying that but if he agrees with his word I have no problems I'm telling you that's why I believe that's right because that way you heard me say it how do you check if people is Doctrine by my new birth who are you for me okay you want to do I check it to see whether it's according to my newborn and you know it must have done pretty good because my batting average is pretty good about all these Doctrine just went around the message that's right that's not bragging that's facts don't have to brag if you stand on something like I've always said now we've got in trouble trying to explain it but I said when you got an old nag of a horse you have to brag on it if you've got a good one you don't have to and I always saying about my wife I said I got a wonderful wife I don't have to brag on her debruce what she never was calling her a horse telling the truth about it that's the problem if you don't understand me I guess mine shouldn't talk like that let's get into the community Paul said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had something this cup is the New Testament in my blood let's do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoes the Lord's death till I come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and shall leading me to that bread and drink of that cup or he that eat it and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickness among you in many sleep where we would judge for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world we're for my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come out to come not together in the condemnation and the wrestle I said in order I'm not good let's just have a few moments of Silent prayer to pray one for another the Lord would be with each and every one of us you pray for me I pray for you all right I Love You Lord we thank you just have your way with each and every one of us forgive us of our sins make us worthy to be Protectors of these things and if we ask it in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread has been made for this purpose today here we come to the time of being able to be to be partakers we ask you that you would sanctify it represents thy body which was given for each and every one of us it represents Thy word Lord all the things and we know for sure it is we're talking this morning gosh the words of eternal life the Lord we love you and we thank you sanctify the bread and the partakers in Jesus name amen foreign a little round wafer to keep over hang on to it try to act like we're religious didn't have a lot of good meaning to it a lot of good things to take place by taking the communion if we just believe it thank the Lord for it that's where I like to break it didn't say no way for it or nothing that's all you believed and go ahead I believe in that the word they took it and they ate the bread they drank the wine but see then we become so righteous that we wouldn't take wine you mean y'all take wine up there make it mistake we don't run by I don't agree with that that's right we get to where we can't do it and have to buy it I'll just we just won't have it that time we will get something because I don't want no attitude foot to it or nothing father we thank you for this wine just went through the process now Lord it's better every day because it represents your blood which was shed for each and every one of us we love you and we thank you we ask you to sanctify the wine sanctify the bread and the partakers that we may be together as one in you in Jesus name all right come morning through the midnight come morning Earth glory for me sometimes I despise and rejected and I question oh Father how then I take one for more and I don't care and it gives me the strength come morning by the river brainstream oh Kerry the Minecraft true midnight um the morning my cross through the midnight good morning without before me Glory you believe it some morning between six and nine Prophet said Something's Gonna take place we know everybody says Well it can't be until in the morning between six and nine well where was he talking about because it can't be six and nine all the way around the world at the same time there's a vast difference in it hmm toy must not have been talking about this that's what everybody says should we go to Jefferson's dealership we'd be in Tucson you know everybody wants to argue the point of blue faces or something I believe it'll be between six and nine and it could sit in here and just keep going as a sweep around the world like that but it'll still be between six and nine one last time put that what does that make us ready to go but you see to know we've got the new birth that's the thing that's going to go what you're looking at rides alone going to be changed but see it's the reveal word that will change us finding out who we are what we're doing that's all it's for eign while we read our scriptures and now I'm asking the brothers are up here do not not put down the foot washing that we get through Reading scripture because that's the same as we were saying this morning about let's honor the word it's just being read let's honor of the prayer it's going to be going in and out I sit back in the office sometime and I see people so I'm gonna come to the door and stand forever and wait all the way through brother call me reading a scripture though and wait that's good not the others have just go in the door now that's not good hey come on don't wait on yourself if you gotta go but if you don't have to go that bad you can wait a few minutes till somebody gets too brave is that long enough amen I try to explain things I just want it to be right man somebody get up right now and run out you got an emergency that's an emergency that's right hip it I'm not talking about that I'm talking about all the way normal everything less respect that's right amen I see the people sometimes when I'm reading scripture here I'll see people that are talking or doing things that's not good I see people that are playing around and doing things it's not convincible all right respect God we come to honor him and worship Him respect him when someone's praying is he somebody up testifying and you see the rest of the people getting their books up and zipping up doing everything you know and I may do that myself but you better believe I'll stop doing it we should honor and respect God kids or kids they play they make a racket you know Brothers never said a word come on get up come up here if you think I am never said a word about crying babies it's always adults right right babies are babies train them that one's crying we got a room they come back don't let them just keep crying because everybody don't want to hear you made me cry you might want to hear it cry but everybody don't want to hear your baby cry so get up take them out do one now with respect I come in this church here see when I came up here this morning that we had to we had the wedding that was fine there's no problem now she'll forgive me right now but they'll say is what he means so don't translate it and make me say something else we had the wedding yesterday we had the life we talked we had the things we had to do decorate and had to move everything all right and then putting it all back when I came in this morning that's the first thing I'm doing we got here real early and I wanted it deliberately turned I turned the tape on and I came up here and I asked God forgive us because of having to do what we've done but yet to sanctify the building amen the prophet of God said one child running through the building would disrupt the next service you want that quote the next service coming up do we grieve the holy spirit amen now you catch that time I'll take it's all running don't jump up right after and we know you know what I'm saying see if people are coming they'll say well brother Dale did you mean my kid it got to run out I couldn't catch it no but if you get it set with you right I think your your children understand weed I've never said a lot about things I think that you would have noticed that weed if they're small enough you know no they need to stay with you right you go to other churches they got all the boys sitting over here all the girls sitting over there I ain't no so worried about that that's a good idea but I've never encouraged it here okay but keep your kids where you can watch them now you may think that your little angels are little angels you won't do nothing I never did think that I always told you that my kids my grandkids and my great grandkids her Halo is held up by horns meaning they're human they're going to do it but adults I'm in trouble kid adults getting upset and can ruin everything in the building and because you don't like something that's said you sit there showered up you know her face what if you're grieving in the Holy Spirit that's right that's right that's right what if it's you that's grieving the Holy Spirit in the Bible they call that out that's right it might come a time again to be called out thank you you start let's just be Christians you don't like what's going on just go to sleep while it's going on you know and they do respectable either but you know what I'm saying let around see it if the brown Tabernacle voted Brother Brad a brother now would have preached Jehovah Witness Doctrine you know what he said he said I would say that that was the leadership of the Holy Spirit now that may be perforation that Mr it's very clever he said God if that's what they want God will let him have he never bragged on the Tabernacle my whole life he'd always say we got our troubles here it's like anywhere you know why because he was honest since you're sincere man right yeah that's right you're staying on these things all right let's read the scripture go into the footwork supper being the end of the devil having now put into the heart of Judah sister Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was coming from God and went to God he rises on supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and guarded himself after that he poured water into a basin to begin to Washington Southwest feet and wipe them with the towel were with he was dirty then cometh either Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord thus that I wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto them what I do what I do that I know it's not now but I shall know Hereafter leadership unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I worse thee not thy is no part with me Simon Peterson to him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head Jesus said unto him he that is worse knee that's not saved to wash his feet but it's clean everywhere and you're clean but not all where he knew who should betray him therefore said he you're not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what happened unto you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master I washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet but I've given you an example that you should that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you if you let's stand and be dismissed and ladies can go downstairs Heavenly Father we thank you for this day we pray Lord we've tried to get across the things to look at things in the right order and to see that your Prophet was right the Bible is right when it says we're either a Christian or we're lost there's no middle area but yet a lot of people Lord dwell in the middle area that are trying to be one thing and trying to be another but you don't look at them like that you look at them as the bases if they don't have the new birth they don't have it so then you just say that it's all lost without it and father those things are so clear but yet we can get our minds muddled up into trying to Define things until we see and find it being in the air in ourselves we love you and we thank you blessing as we go on into the foot worship and then be with the people on the way home give everybody a safe journey may your love be with each one of us in Jesus name amen amen you're dismissal thank you
