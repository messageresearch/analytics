[0:35] through these scriptures Lord God and
[0:37] just Quicken it to us give us something
[0:39] to help and encourage Lord we pray in
[0:41] your name
[0:43] amen now we're on Hebrews chapter 13: 7
[0:47] that says remember them which have the
[0:49] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[0:51] the word of God whose Faith follow
[0:54] considering the end of their
[0:55] conversation which is Jesus Christ the
[0:57] same yesterday today and forever and so
[1:00] we've just kind of been diving into this
[1:03] remember them which have the rule over
[1:04] you and you know if you really study
[1:06] that out there's there's two ways that e
[1:10] either either uh the word of God will
[1:12] claim your life and the and the Holy
[1:15] Ghost is actually ruling you through the
[1:17] preaching of the true gospel or men's
[1:20] ideas will will will will uh rule over
[1:24] you and it's it's uh and so we've kind
[1:27] of been examining that nickan spirit
[1:29] that began to move in the in the in the
[1:32] very first church age that Antichrist
[1:35] Spirit to to limit the moving of the
[1:38] Holy Ghost and to counteract uh to to
[1:40] counteract that and so you know remember
[1:44] them which have the rule over you you
[1:45] really think
[1:46] about maybe one example would be Phillip
[1:49] running up to that Ethiopian unic and
[1:52] the Ethiopian unic saying I I I want to
[1:54] understand what I'm reading here and
[1:56] Philip saying you do you do you
[1:58] understand and he sits down with with
[1:59] him and begins to explain and as he
[2:02] explains the word something begins to
[2:04] grab hold of that man's uh heart and he
[2:08] you know they pass by some water as
[2:09] they're riding in that Chariot and he
[2:11] says I you know I what what what
[2:13] prevents me from going down and getting
[2:15] baptized so what what's ruling in there
[2:17] in that situation not a man's idea but
[2:19] the word is actually claiming his life
[2:21] and begins to to to he begins to he
[2:25] begins to see what that scripture in
[2:27] Isaiah is talking about begins to
[2:29] identify by Jesus Christ with the
[2:31] scriptures and begin to say well you're
[2:33] telling me how to be baptized and who
[2:34] this man is and I I want to fulfill the
[2:37] scriptures so he goes the the word is
[2:39] actually moving him to do that and uh
[2:42] counteract that with on the other side
[2:45] um down through the Dark Ages and down
[2:47] through history you've got priest you
[2:49] know like this picture a man with his
[2:51] eyes blinded he can't see the scripture
[2:53] you got somebody leaning over his
[2:54] shoulder like the the priest telling him
[2:56] well I'll tell you how to get somebody
[2:57] out of purgatory you need to pay me some
[2:59] money give me your cow and I'll and
[3:01] that'll fund my prayers to get somebody
[3:03] out of the Purgatory and they're
[3:05] actually limiting the moving of the Holy
[3:07] Ghost because how can the Holy Ghost
[3:09] move across false Doctrine and and and
[3:12] and so they got that that organization
[3:14] is actually preventing God from being
[3:16] able to move in in in the fullness that
[3:18] or you see oh you see why why full the
[3:21] full Doctrine the Full Gospel that we
[3:24] have in this hour is so important it's
[3:26] supposed to unleash the full the the
[3:28] ability of the Holy Ghost to move
[3:29] forward in our lives amen
[3:32] so what what is nickan ISM why did God
[3:36] hate their deeds if you go back and
[3:37] examine uh so that's that's really what
[3:39] we're talking that rule that man man's
[3:42] ideas ruling over people ruling over the
[3:46] situation instead of the Holy Ghost now
[3:48] brother Ram said in the first seal he
[3:50] said now
[3:52] remember let's just take our time and
[3:54] read some of these quotes he said now
[3:56] remember about the time Christ come on
[3:57] the throne the Antichrist Christ come on
[4:00] the throne
[4:01] Judas about the time Christ went off the
[4:04] Earth Judas went off the Earth just
[4:05] about the time the Holy Spirit Come Back
[4:07] the Antichrist come back you know John
[4:10] said over here little children I would
[4:11] not have you ignorant you know about the
[4:13] Antichrist which he's already come and
[4:15] working in the children of
[4:17] Disobedience the Antichrist then there
[4:21] he was began to form and there the
[4:23] nickan spirit to make an organization so
[4:27] now we we're just labeling things nickan
[4:31] Spirit Antichrist Spirit mystery of
[4:34] iniquity tack all those things together
[4:37] that's what he's talking about the
[4:40] Antichrist Spirit then that was begin to
[4:43] form there and the nican spirit to make
[4:45] an organization he said no wonder I
[4:48] hated that thing see there you are it
[4:50] wasn't me it was something in here
[4:53] there's the thing it's come out you see
[4:55] you see it I was all around the sides of
[4:58] it I couldn't see it till now I know it
[5:00] now there it is that nickan Spirit God
[5:04] hated and now that Spirit become
[5:07] incarnate and they crowned it and here
[5:10] it is right here what the Bible said
[5:12] they do with it perfect what does it say
[5:15] that he he hated it back there in
[5:17] Revelation Chapter 2 Under the ANG right
[5:19] when it first started moving under the
[5:20] angel of the Church of
[5:22] Ephesus remember therefore from which
[5:24] Thou Art fallen in verse six but this
[5:26] thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of
[5:29] the
[5:30] nicians which I also hate now as we
[5:33] study this out you can really kind of
[5:35] begin to see why God would hate that cuz
[5:37] he he wants the true gospel to be
[5:40] preached so that he can have Liberty in
[5:42] the congregation to be able to move and
[5:44] to do to to baptized with the Holy Ghost
[5:47] to be able to fill people with the
[5:49] spirit and and that nickel an idea that
[5:52] man's idea that's contradicting it it's
[5:55] really the devil prevents that so you
[5:58] see these two things these two these two
[6:01] things God moving with a genuine moving
[6:04] and something that's fake the Antichrist
[6:07] Spirit the devil moving taking maybe
[6:10] taking just one word off twisting the
[6:12] thing so that God can't move now you got
[6:15] and now brother Brown said in the second
[6:17] seal he said now watch first nickan the
[6:20] nician was called in the Bible
[6:22] Antichrist because it was against the
[6:24] original doctrine of Christ and the
[6:26] apostles now I've got a little picture
[6:28] here that shows the first seal and you
[6:30] can see these two these two forces just
[6:32] toose you got a lion on one side and
[6:35] then a white horse on the other side and
[6:38] what did Brother Ram say in the first
[6:40] day he said that's what that that's that
[6:41] white horse rider under the way of a
[6:44] white righteous church but an
[6:48] antichrist it's got to look like on a
[6:50] horse even just like Christ is coming on
[6:52] a horse so close and deceive the very
[6:56] elect here he is he's the Antichrist he
[7:00] started riding in the first church age
[7:03] now he rides on down on down through
[7:06] every
[7:08] age so what what's that white horse
[7:10] signifying that nickan Antichrist Spirit
[7:13] or an anointed one starting off some to
[7:16] counteract the real genuine baptism of
[7:19] the Holy Ghost in the first seal brother
[7:21] R said at the end time these books
[7:22] that's been rolled up all this time with
[7:24] these mysteries in them is broken then
[7:26] out comes the mystery to see what it is
[7:29] but actually they started forth at the
[7:31] first church age because at the first
[7:33] church age received the message a white
[7:36] horse rider went out see who is he he's
[7:38] Mighty in his conquering power as a
[7:40] great fellow in his conquering power you
[7:43] want me to tell you who he is he's the
[7:45] Antichrist that's exactly what he is now
[7:49] because you see if an antichrist Jesus
[7:51] said that the two would be so close
[7:53] together until it would deceive the very
[7:56] elected the bride if it was possible if
[7:59] it was
[8:00] possible what what's going to keep you
[8:01] from being deceived though a true
[8:04] understanding of the word you got a
[8:06] revelation a real Revelation that's been
[8:08] unfolded to you and you won't be able to
[8:11] be deceived in in this if if the word is
[8:14] fully unfolded to you Antichrist is the
[8:17] Antichrist spirit and in the Ephesian
[8:20] Church H he said what the church had at
[8:21] Pentecost is her inable right originally
[8:25] she had the pure word of God she had the
[8:28] power of the spirit manifested in divers
[8:31] signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy
[8:32] Ghost that original church was not
[8:35] organized by men it was led by the Holy
[8:39] Ghost there's what God wants God wants
[8:42] each individual in the church to be led
[8:45] by the Holy Ghost and have their own
[8:47] relationship with God right it wasn't
[8:50] very big it was hated and despised it
[8:51] was oppressed it was persecuted unto
[8:53] death but it was true to God it stayed
[8:57] with the original word pattern
[9:00] and in the pergam peran church age he
[9:02] said you will recall that I brought out
[9:05] in the Ephesian age that the word nickan
[9:08] comes from two Greek words nio which
[9:11] means to conquer and Leo which means the
[9:14] Le nickan means to conquer the Le now
[9:19] why is this such a terrible thing it is
[9:21] terrible because God has never placed
[9:24] his church in the hands of an elected
[9:27] leadership which moves with political
[9:30] mindedness he has placed his church in
[9:33] the care of God ordained spirit filled
[9:37] word living men who lead the people
[9:41] through feeding them the
[9:43] word he has not separated the people
[9:46] into classes so that the masses are led
[9:49] by a holy priesthood it is true that the
[9:52] leadership must be holy but then so must
[9:55] be the whole
[9:56] congregation further there is no no
[9:59] place in the word where priests or
[10:02] ministers or such mediate between God
[10:04] and the people nor is there a place
[10:07] where they are separated in their
[10:09] worship of the Lord God wants all to
[10:12] love and serve him together
[10:15] nanism destroys those precepts and
[10:19] instead separates the ministers from the
[10:21] people and makes the leaders overlords
[10:24] instead of
[10:26] servants now we're what we're examine
[10:29] was we're examining that nickan Spirit
[10:32] he said in the Ephesian Church age he
[10:34] said well here we'll take it when the
[10:35] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[10:38] were all in one place and one Accord and
[10:42] the pastor came down and preached a fine
[10:44] sermon and say give me the right hand of
[10:46] fellowship and we'll put your name on
[10:48] the book that don't sound right does it
[10:50] you might get that you couldn't get that
[10:51] in an Alman act they know better than
[10:53] that the old lady's birthday Almanac is
[10:55] more correct than that would be well
[10:58] what caused that then
[10:59] the nickan bringing in a bunch of men to
[11:03] twist up the
[11:04] scripture and make a denomination now
[11:07] here's the clencher here's the essence
[11:09] of that nickan spirit that can't let God
[11:13] move in it that can't let God move dies
[11:18] right there Then he said you're dead you
[11:20] got to name you're living but you're
[11:23] dead many of them dead and don't know it
[11:27] and the sardian church AG he said it was
[11:29] quite a large church at the beginning
[11:31] but they started a denominational Spirit
[11:33] coming among them trying to denominate
[11:35] the church which was called the Deeds of
[11:39] the
[11:40] nicians the Deeds of the nicians now it
[11:42] wasn't a Doctrine yet and then we took
[11:45] the word and broke it down what was
[11:47] Deeds what was nickan that's a foreign
[11:50] name to us so I took the Greek and broke
[11:52] it down and niik means to conquer or to
[11:54] overcome or overthrow something nickan a
[11:59] deed a Deeds that was trying to
[12:01] overthrow the Le and put all the
[12:04] blessing and the only one to read the
[12:06] Bible the only one to give the
[12:08] interpretation would be the bishop or
[12:10] some great head person of the church why
[12:14] is that so bad because God wants you to
[12:16] have your own personal relationship God
[12:19] wants you to experience the power of the
[12:21] Holy Ghost in your life God wants you to
[12:23] experience the liberty of the Holy Ghost
[12:25] in your life and when you got a priest
[12:27] like that picture I I lean over your
[12:29] head that picture that we were looking
[12:30] at and your eyes are blinded and it's
[12:32] all put on somebody else then that's
[12:35] contrary to what God wants to see done
[12:37] in your life God wants you to have a
[12:40] personal relationship with Jesus
[12:43] Christ the Ephesian Church age build
[12:45] around said now Paul's wolves had become
[12:47] nickan they were trying to form a
[12:49] priesthood like the levitical priesthood
[12:51] which was foreign to the New Testament
[12:54] Doctrine the word niik means to conquer
[12:57] overcome overcome what the Ley the Holy
[13:01] Spirit take out of the church the
[13:04] resurrected Lord Jesus with signs and
[13:07] wonders among the Believers and put men
[13:10] voted in to be a pope or a carnal
[13:12] Cardinal or an
[13:14] overseer trying to take the Holy Ghost
[13:17] away from the Le and give it to a order
[13:20] called The Holy order of men placing
[13:22] them over the lady not to call them
[13:25] pastors which means Shepherds but Father
[13:28] which Jesus said don't you call no man
[13:30] father on this Earth see that evil thing
[13:33] and what did we do why do you call not
[13:36] call any man father because you didn't
[13:37] get that eternal life from a man you got
[13:41] it from God God is your father when you
[13:43] begotten of him he's put his own life in
[13:46] you and you call him
[13:48] father brother that's why we go back to
[13:50] that quote that we've been reading it is
[13:52] the word that rule rules us this is
[13:54] Brother brand I'm explaining that
[13:55] scripture obey them which have the rule
[13:57] over you it's the the word that rules us
[14:00] not men now as a man as a husband as
[14:03] head of the woman he rules her but the
[14:05] church is a woman too and her ruler is
[14:08] the word Jesus is the
[14:11] word and the Ephesian Church age again
[14:13] he said it started out in the early
[14:15] church it was called Deeds then it
[14:18] became a Doctrine it became the standard
[14:20] it became the unbending way it finally
[14:23] took over and what happened God was
[14:26] pushed aside which is always what
[14:29] happens when you begin to take man's
[14:31] ideas instead of the word of God and
[14:32] begin to like they did all down through
[14:34] the church ages organize it until they
[14:36] were they had a pope over them oh it
[14:39] started so small so quietly so
[14:41] inoffensively it looked so good it
[14:42] seemed so sound then it c a hold and
[14:45] like a python it squeezed out the very
[14:48] breath and killed all the spirituality
[14:52] there was in the church now that's what
[14:54] the nickan that's why God hates the de
[14:56] and nicians cuz it's strangling out all
[14:59] the
[15:00] spirituality the signs and wonders the
[15:02] Liberty the movement of the Holy Ghost
[15:04] and the people that are sitting in the
[15:06] congregation oh that false Vine is
[15:08] subtle it is like an angel of Light
[15:11] until it gets a hold on you now I want
[15:14] to say that I believe in leadership but
[15:16] is it is not the leadership of men I
[15:18] believe in I believe in the leadership
[15:21] of the Holy Ghost coming through the
[15:24] word he said I believe also that God has
[15:27] set men in the church
[15:29] men who are gifted by the spirit and
[15:31] they will keep the church in order I
[15:33] believe that I believe also that the
[15:34] church is ruled over by men that God
[15:37] sends to take charge but that rule is by
[15:41] the word so that it is not men really
[15:44] ruling but the spirit of God for the
[15:47] word and spirit are
[15:51] one he said in again in the Ephesian
[15:54] Church age he said Paul saw it coming
[15:56] but he warned them about this subtle
[15:58] priesthood that would come and take over
[16:00] with its false doctrines he knew they
[16:02] would Implement a way of worship that
[16:04] excluded the people from any part in a
[16:06] holy spirit Ministry and even right
[16:09] today among those who claim to be free
[16:11] and full of the spirit there is not too
[16:13] much freedom in the lity and the best we
[16:16] can see is a few preachers with inspired
[16:19] preaching while the flock just sits
[16:20] there and tries to absorb it this is a
[16:23] far cry from Paul who said that when all
[16:25] came together all had the leading of the
[16:28] spirit and and what all participated in
[16:32] spiritual worship oh there's when you're
[16:34] really fulfilling where we all have our
[16:36] licks of fire that we bring together and
[16:38] here sitting together in the
[16:40] congregation it's like one great big
[16:42] Pillar of Fire come together because
[16:44] everybody's got their own relationship
[16:46] with God right not just one
[16:49] man and the church corporate has never
[16:51] learned this lesson from the scripture
[16:53] nor from history every time God gives a
[16:55] visitation of the Holy Spirit and people
[16:58] get
[16:59] free after a while they bind themselves
[17:01] right back to the very thing they came
[17:03] out of
[17:04] amen he said again they set the word
[17:07] aside deny the work of the spirit of God
[17:10] subjugate the lady and make it
[17:12] impossible for the lady to worship God
[17:15] unless they come through them or through
[17:16] their pattern which is nothing but a
[17:18] blueprint of unbelief from Satan
[17:21] himself and the sman church she said the
[17:25] Lutheran Revival never did rise up again
[17:27] the West Revival never did rise up again
[17:30] the Nazarene Revival did not rise up
[17:32] again neither will the Pentecostal
[17:33] Revival rise up again why because you
[17:36] killed it you hybrid it with the world
[17:38] with the nickan idea not let the Holy
[17:42] Ghost have its way that's right you
[17:45] hybrid the church and it can't breed
[17:47] itself back
[17:50] again so what's the conclusion of the
[17:53] matter remember them which had the rule
[17:55] over you not by ruling not by ruling
[17:58] with man's ideas whether with our own
[18:00] carnal thoughts or things to organize
[18:02] like into a denominational system or
[18:04] something like that but ruling with the
[18:06] word by preaching the gospel so that the
[18:09] Holy Ghost can have Liberty in this
[18:10] assembly and change people's lives by
[18:12] the true teaching of the word remember
[18:15] them which have the rule over you who
[18:16] have spoken unto you the word of God
[18:18] whose Faith follow why are you following
[18:21] because it's the true it's true
[18:23] according to the gospel according to the
[18:25] Bible considering the end of their
[18:27] conversation in other words remember
[18:28] your leaders and the consequences of
[18:31] their faith in God and We examined that
[18:34] a few week weeks ago that you can look
[18:35] at the lives of the people that that
[18:38] have been preaching the gospel and
[18:39] examine them and see that see the effect
[18:41] of the Gospel on their life and remember
[18:43] what their faith wrought in their own
[18:45] life and and that will give you
[18:47] confidence confidence to believe that he
[18:50] is the same yesterday today and forever
[18:55] now now what's that mean now let's
[18:56] examine that for a little bit that he
[18:58] would act the same now there's a true a
[19:01] true understanding of the Gospel that'll
[19:03] give you Liberty to know that he'll act
[19:05] the same that he did back there yes that
[19:07] he's the same yesterday today and
[19:09] forever
[19:13] Amen brother Brown said if that is the
[19:15] same Spirit here as it was then it'll
[19:19] manifest the word like it did then and
[19:22] you see how these things stack on one
[19:23] another if you got the true the true
[19:26] gospel being preached that it will allow
[19:29] the true genuine Holy Ghost to move
[19:32] there's no he said there's no difference
[19:33] in him at all he lives in his church
[19:35] doing the same thing that means that the
[19:39] same signs and wonders that were done in
[19:41] the early church could be done in today
[19:43] because he still the same let's examine
[19:46] what he says here he said if that is the
[19:48] same holy spirit that was in the
[19:49] wilderness with Israel and also was in
[19:52] Jesus Christ it's now in the church it
[19:54] does the same works because it's the
[19:57] same light
[19:58] it's the same Spirit if you could just
[20:02] believe that
[20:03] friend he said in Hot Springs Arkansas
[20:05] he said and brother when you try to read
[20:08] of a painted fire of Pentecost and
[20:11] somebody tries to tell you that the Holy
[20:13] Spirit isn't the same today as it was
[20:17] then somebody tries to tell you the days
[20:19] of Miracles has passed that Jesus Christ
[20:21] isn't the same yesterday today and
[20:23] forever that they try to tell you don't
[20:26] you believe it them is not pictures God
[20:29] Almighty sent that message to you that's
[20:32] right it's for you and to your children
[20:34] to them that's far off even as many as
[20:36] the Lord Our God shall call God is still
[20:40] God Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[20:43] today and
[20:45] forever he is right here tonight to save
[20:49] the lost to heal the sick to fill the
[20:51] Holy Spirit those who desire to be
[20:54] filled and I pray maybe that now you you
[20:57] know you you go back and remember that
[20:59] picture I showed of The Lion and the
[21:01] white horse rider and maybe that will
[21:03] begin to unfold what that really
[21:05] represents something fake to keep you
[21:07] from the true moving of the Holy Ghost
[21:09] an antichrist Spirit to prevent the holy
[21:11] ghost from having Liberty in your life
[21:13] and something genuine something real a
[21:17] lion that represents the power of the
[21:19] holy ghost moving in the people and
[21:21] those two things are are battling out
[21:24] they're battling out right now they're
[21:25] still moving but God wants you to
[21:28] recognize that he is still the same as
[21:31] he always is always has been and brother
[21:34] R said in the patriarch Abraham he said
[21:36] if you can't take that word test then if
[21:39] you doubt it little suspicious of it you
[21:41] can't hardly believe it there's
[21:43] something or other you can't believe it
[21:44] then don't you come in the prayer line I
[21:46] wouldn't even fool around the altar till
[21:48] you can get enough Grace to know that
[21:50] God's word is true right and when you
[21:52] once break through that veil of unbelief
[21:56] then you got the keys in your hands of
[21:58] death hell and the grave because you've
[22:00] got a conqueror who conquered for you
[22:02] then you've got Hebrews 13:8 that tells
[22:06] us Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[22:10] today and forever oh to see to to not
[22:13] recognize that that he's still the same
[22:15] it's like you being being having your
[22:17] mind veiled off to really the true
[22:19] essence of and that's what the word the
[22:22] word was given to us to break through
[22:24] those things so that God can have
[22:26] Liberty in our life yes he said in
[22:29] wisdom versus Faith How could a lily
[22:31] live a lily seed live and grow when it
[22:34] thrives on Waters grow and one of those
[22:36] Dusty denominations where that nickol
[22:39] and spirit's moving what to prevent the
[22:41] holy ghost from being able to move how
[22:44] could it do it when it thrives on water
[22:45] water is the spirit they have a form of
[22:48] godliness but deny the power of the
[22:51] spirit see through the word falls on
[22:53] them it can't though the word falls on
[22:55] them it can't grow it can't grow grow
[22:59] just like the word was on Eve but it
[23:00] couldn't grow why she accepted wisdom
[23:04] Satan's wisdom the word comes to them
[23:06] the word falls on them sure it does
[23:08] it'll fall on them they can hear the
[23:09] word preached did you ever see people
[23:12] set in the church they never will make a
[23:14] move preach to women about bobbed hair
[23:17] year after year still got bobbed hair
[23:20] talk to men about smoking women about
[23:22] drinking they drink right on just the
[23:24] same just like pouring water on a duck's
[23:27] back it ain't got no place to grow it's
[23:30] that old pleasure seeking popularity
[23:32] well let the rest of the women do it
[23:34] first then I will I don't care what they
[23:36] do it's your duty to follow the word of
[23:38] God though the word falls on them it
[23:41] can't grow Satan's wisdom see so it just
[23:43] becomes denominational dust they can't
[23:47] believe in Hebrews
[23:50] 138 all puffed up with the wisdom
[23:52] nothing for it to grow in how can they
[23:55] believe Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the
[23:58] same yesterday today and forever
[24:01] couldn't do it see oh they say they
[24:02] believe it oh you tell them that they
[24:04] say sure we believe it then show me the
[24:06] fruits of it let me see it let me see it
[24:09] being done let me see the church that
[24:10] you're preaching to do what they did and
[24:13] the First Apostolic Church then that
[24:16] believe the
[24:18] word you see what he's saying he's
[24:20] saying if you really believe Hebrews
[24:22] 13:8 that will produce the same Christ
[24:27] that was man ested in the early church
[24:29] age you'll see that same God moving if
[24:33] you believe it like that he said in
[24:35] scriptural signs of the time remember
[24:37] our God is still the god of Elijah he is
[24:40] still the God that he ever was he is
[24:43] still the same God he moves in the same
[24:47] cycle he does the same thing he is the
[24:51] same yesterday today and forever I've
[24:54] seen them stand dumbfounded paralyzed
[24:58] and taken off the field God Still
[25:01] Remains God he said if I had had
[25:04] listened to reasons there would probably
[25:06] have been thousands of people died years
[25:08] ago but I carried a message exactly like
[25:11] he said around and around the world and
[25:14] I'm going again by the grace of God not
[25:17] by reasons but by a commission I lean
[25:20] not you say you're 55 years old if I was
[25:23] 95 that don't mean a thing amen and
[25:27] we'll stop on this as the musicians come
[25:29] forward he is still the same God that he
[25:33] was with Abraham he is still the same
[25:37] yesterday today and forever he is still
[25:39] the same God to any man that's been
[25:42] called to take the word of God God will
[25:45] stand by him if he don't be a
[25:48] calary God bless you
[25:56] amen
[26:14] than
