standing I want to just make an announcement I sit back in the office and I see and I do it other times but I see some of you coming in and going out while the Bible is being read that's disrespectful

they're having to travel on later Lord going on back to to their word they're going to be at home you just be with them take care of them just have your way with each and every one of us got us now blessing you said in your words you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe him we thank you we commit it to you now in Jesus name all right Matthew 5. it will be up on the board there if you want to read it verse 37-48 then we'll go to John 6 verse 60. but let your communication be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right she turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go on my own remember this is right after the Beatitudes you know Beatitudes blessed is he the blessed is he blessed is he now the Lord is showing you what the Beatitudes turn into living in our lives right you remember that right you have heard that it has been said I shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you here's the attitudes in action now love your enemies bless them that curse you and do good do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven pretty maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and send us Reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even Republicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans show and watch as he sums it up be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect all right let's go over to John we read that every scripture because we're in a study on um be therefore perfect this is message number three so then we take a title from that and then we go forth with John 6 16. many therefore his disciples when they heard this said this isn't hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself the Disciples of murmured at it he said unto them does this offends you you know you got to eat this you eat nothing you eat you know the father and the when Jesus knew it himself the disciples murmured it he said unto them does this offends you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before amen it is the spirit that quick enough the flesh prophets of nothing the words I speak unto thee once they were spiriting their life but there are some of you that believe not or Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it was we're given unto him of my father from that time many of the disciples went back and walked not no more with him then said Jesus unto the 12. will you also go away little word you want to go to right amen what was the answer then Simon Peter answered in Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life so you can be seated will stop right there he goes on to say that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God now as I said we've been in a in a series and I gently preach anywhere from 20 to 50 sermons when I get in a series I used to sign scripture as a thought but then continue on in what I'm wanting you to see because you know as we've said before many times they've argued about that Matthew 5 48. where it says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and you know the denominations people have argued that and then you hear it even among the uh messaged people to argue about what that means and they try to define words and that's fine it's all right because it says there that um Scofield even gives it that um it's not the fact of talking about sin that Jesus was talking about he was talking about growth development do we know that that goes with it but you know we we still have to uh keep it in the correct line because we just say well this is the definition well the definition of a wording can be fine because you remember that we used our in in Genesis 6 and 9 where it says Noah was perfect all right in his generation job one and one job one and eight and job two and three all says that job was perfect right all right and then Genesis 17 it says for Abraham was told to walk before God would be perfect all right then in Psalms 37 and 37 I think this is Mark the perfect man right all right but then we found out that were the the word in Genesis 6 and 9 that says to for that Noah was perfect it means completeness sound etc etc it's not talking about Sin and sinlessness right it's more talking of a stature a point but we also found that that was the number 8549 and you strong but we found that in Ezekiel 28 where it's talking about Satan right he said he was perfect when he was created and he was sure because God can't create any create anything imperfect that's right so he was perfect in his creation right but then he went forth you know and went on but it's the same definition amen do people want to argue about what this means and what that means instead of taking the whole things and a lot of people they believe that Noah was the only righteous seed which many was the only seed of God and everything else was serpent seed and that's in the message now and it you know he so that would have ended at the flood and that would have been a problem but I like the way it wrote around says he said will you say that the curse was Blackness to put up on cage that ended at the flood well if there was only one righteous seed left and Noah was the only one then everything out of there is messed up you know and so that solves the problem but that don't solve it to people that don't want to hear it that's right because they're not going to do it it's just like everybody else will say you know you say well the Bible said be perfect you think be perfect amen well now if the Bible says I am right then your argument is not with me right that's right your argument is with God amen amen because he was the one that said it and that's what I've been trying to get across a couple of messages that even in the Old Testament then we haven't got to the New Testament we're bordering on it today of coming in you know and you know in just a minute and you'll see what we're getting to to border on between the old and the New Testament then this afternoon we'll come on over into the New Testament with it that in the Old Testament no it was perfect right well I really don't now you just talked to God right I'm gonna argue with you right you just talked to him I'm like this would just we're preaching all right you say well it says job he was perfect God said it three times that's right now anytime according to the prophet anytime God repeats himself there's a total repeat of the uh first chapter in in there and uh two and um first and eight I believe or somewhere in there and two and three it's just identical repeat all right and if God repeats itself the prophet said listen you know listen because he's saying something right Amen in other words he's stamping it with a a point of saying listen to this right you know verily burning oh yeah amen I say unto you yeah that means it's a double statement of listen amen because it means something all right now that's the way I look at it because that's what I followed the Bible all right but then we say well it's impossible to be perfect I agree 100 that's right amen it is impossible for any mortal human being do you ever think about being perfect right amen now this is going to stumble you because we're going to go over to it eventually even under the New Testament blood of Jesus Christ it's impossible for a human mortal being to be perfect right man within themselves are you with me amen yes but brother then we're perfect in the New Testament but wasn't perfect in the old show me the Bible I just gave you scripture that it says they were perfect that's just a few you know scriptures to show you that God looked down and when he said for Noah to make that atonement right amen he made it right his arguing Brothers came you know three of them when they first with him chapter after chapter that he'd secretly sinned he said I haven't done it amen he said sure I'm a human being I'm a moral but said show me what I've done wrong amen and they couldn't do it all right fine because he was under the atonement right even maybe atonement of those expression the other day for his children and God saved them right amen all right that's right now that's how much the atonement was made all right see then when we come to look at it what made him perfect the atonement right red through red you see why God couldn't see him because he made you oh man when they made that atonement for sin they settlement right now here's where we go to and I said I've seen tags it said said I'm not perfect I'm just just I'm just forgiving well now if you're forgiven if God forgives you right how can he ever bring it up again right you see the corner of Mind wants to make beautiful statements that people looked at that you know and probably um no 99 of the people have looked at that tag thought well that's right I'm not perfect I'm just forgive but when I looked at it I said Thank God I'm forgiving that makes me perfect right amen hallelujah amen brother to Hell mate that make you no God said I was that's right you argue with him I'm not trying to express nothing but the Bible right and the prophet's message to what he said all right so I gave you some quotes let's just pull these up going and start reading on them but brother random says it these were perfect so you can't argue with him somehow you can you I know this ain't gonna convert nobody I've always said that well you ain't gonna convert nobody don't want to be converted right you ain't gonna change nobody's mind it don't want to be changed that's right you could spend six months sitting there with them pounding them to death about it that the Bible says the prophet said they come out and say but why did you saying amen yeah we're not perfect oh we might be forgiven well I thought the Bible said no more that our sin was in the seal forgetfulness to Never Be Remembered anymore I I thought that's what the Bible said Amen brother Dan what are you trying to get to us one thing we've got to believe what God says what do you mean we've been in the message 40 years and you're still trying to tell us that yeah amen we're around here 40 more I'll still be trying to tell you that all right amen amen because that's what we're not doing we're not believing What God Says About Us amen amen we sympathize with the message the prophet said oh my God act right oh my God in other words you know what he means sympathize is not like feeling sorry for the message that's not what he's saying that means he's meaning that we just we just kind of take what little bit we we want and one little bit we can do and we kind of go along with what we think is right like I talked to sister's husband there was a he was telling me about the Quran and things and you know he said the Bible's writing places he said we bled I said in other words what I read to you that you want to agree with is Right amen but when it says you don't want to agree with is not right green because it you know that's right all right but now listen look what the prophet of God said about it we find out that on the message 1961's 808 from the house you see now we find out that job was a righteous man no no and when God was testing him they called said and said oh sure when you come up before God with the sons of God he said now evidently Satan must have been covered enough because he could stand the presence of God when I'm understanding his sin in the presence of God is supposed to be annihilated right that's right evidently Satan has some way that God is still using the old boy right when we come up before God when the sons of God he said as God said to him where were where you been he said oh just walking up to and fro and up and down on the Earth see you considered my servant job he's a perfect man amen now that's your Prophet saying drop them down to what's underlined you read the other he's a perfect man and that was before the blood of Jesus Christ was shed see and he said he's a perfect man he's just he's upright there is none like him amen all right right now your Prophet could say he was perfect the Bible says he's perfect amen but do you believe he was perfect don't believe he's perfect I argued with him for about 10 chapters probably amen yep right amen and even eliu which is Christ The Fourth Man when he came to him he didn't argue with him about his Perfection of the atonement right but brother Rome said he told him he was just a little bit too self-righteous that's right well you know what self-righteous means righteousness of yourself not good enough shall righteous in other words he was saying I didn't do it yep I'm not guilty amen but under the blood of Jesus Christ we're guilty of all things under the blood of bulls and goats if you looked at a woman there was no listening to that right amen right it was just you don't do adultery right but when you get the New Testament you start looking then amen changes do different things that's right all right are we talking about it right look at the next one I'm just getting things to worry that you'll you'll hold on to it which is a message here what's the father the prophet of God says what many people want to say because somebody's sick but they did Evil I mean the truth Joe is a perfect man no I said so but sometimes God bless the fix and hear these people and test them for their faith he was testing a saint and not rebuking The Sinner amen amen that's reason I held that he was test testing a saint not rebuking a sinner and God does that to test amen so every time you get sick don't mean that you're doing something wrong right it could mean you've done something right amen you're taller than that amen quit thinking about home and consider sometimes I might be right amen I tried all right but now listen we went through trying to show through the Bible that the prophet of God says under the atonement in the Old Testament that in God's eyes they were perfect amen amen that's why your one atonement was made see you had many atonements for for things you've done individually right amen right Chic adulteries Etc you had things and you had all kind of atonements had to be made for everything a baby born it just had to be done that had to be done all right those were individuals but once a year yep amen that high priest had to go make the atonement for the entire tribe of Israelite amen you know those that were Believers to live under it all right and that's fired them during that year you know because it was what God required amen see that's my point so we can conclude by saying that surely under the atonement of the Old Testament that the people could be called perfect amen sure because of the blood atonement all right so we've been through this now so this review and knowing that that blood atonement every one of them spoke of Jesus Christ amen right to come to make his atonement right so then all sin was just in the Old Testament was just covered right that's right right okay pushing it forward the word Jesus Christ died once for all right amen all right that's why I said the other day I was trying to show you little points along the way that's why that a lot of the Old Testament Saints who don't say all of them so that's a problem but still it says some of them many of them I think it said amen went up with Jesus well you know if it wasn't perfect how could it go up amen must have showed that it was all in Christ they couldn't go up until he came amen that's right that's right so he was the perfect atonement right amen all right then you remember I kept saying it this way then how much more sure should we believe that's it in the New Testament by the blood of Jesus Christ by the new birth that we could say that we are perfect amen amen right because we have the new birth the prophet of God I believe it's in the token I'm pretty sure it's in that one he said God won't impute sin over the token right amen that's why your Old Testament was a Record Keeper all right man that's right all right but it was just a Record Keeper what she done that's right that's right Jim Bill said boy bless God we ain't under Record Keeper no more now we're under Jesus Christ was magnified right amen right he went from the doing to the thoughts right right amen magnified all right what you say like this see I try to write them what people think oh there's a weapons see how much more sure should we believe in that in God's eyes that as long as we're under the atonement right right we're perfect perfect amen that's right amen now did you follow me yes I said under the atonement yeah you remember the man that was blessing with brother randomly put it up today a man with question one brother around him when he was talking on the seal book I brought this quote the man was saying that you know well now there is no altar in heaven you know well see you you run your scriptures and we all talk about in heaven that there's an altar amen and we talk about Jesus Christ on the altar well you can't read that as a direct quote the right and that's what the man was arguing with brother random said there's no altar in heaven in the New Testament he said cause we don't need an altar because the altar is within us in other words all right so here's what the prophet of God had to say about it he said now there's this now if there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven where is the sacrifice for sin lay and then right the lamb there has to be a place where this laying lamb bloody is laying down where the blood is now the incense was the older odorous stuff that they burnt which the Bible said was the price of the Saints now that's the scripture that's right amen that puts your altar see the word that it brings it in the right perspective if there isn't No sacrifice on the altar then the prayers cannot be received right it's only by the blood on the sacrificial altar that lets the prayers go through to God so you better believe whether you own it or can find it or want to take what other people says well there is no scripture it says there's a body laying on the throne well you got a lot of body on the throne you got a lot about that but there is no scripture about that a body is laying on the throne oh there's nothing laying there I don't like it that way you know what I love when he made the atonement my Tomah then was made Eternal all right man come on I have an eternal right atonement how much more would it be than the blood of bulls and ghosts how much more would it be of the blood even of a man amen it's an eternal atonement because it's not one he's not stretched out on the throne waiting on them you know alter waiting on everything to get through no it's a sacrificial altar they were sold under the altar right all right but those will be dealing with the Jews and the thing that's right but see we have one daughter for you and I which is what John 1 verse John 1 John 2 1 says that if we have if we sin we have an advocate right Jesus Christ the righteous amen so we do have one to pay the atonement you don't misunderstand my way of expressing things because I try to make it as blunt as I can to where you won't misunderstand me and you don't have to figure out what I'm talking about I'm telling you what I'm talking about right that's the way I talk you just can't find the Bible scripture you can't find where it says there's every tub will sit on its own bottom that ain't in the Bible amen but we used to quote it can't tell the difference in the season set the button in the trees and she had nothing to leave that ain't in the Bible amen but we quoted it and formed by it but it's not in there right see so if you start running to find a body laying on the throne just remember the sacrificial altar that it was speaking of the word the prayers of the Saints could go through so he's making the atonement that our prayers can go through he doesn't see us the prophet says we're under the blood of Jesus Christ right right right he said the whole world is under the blood or else God would destroy it all right but said he hears my voice amen he hears my voice to the blood all right so then God not sitting by looking down at the blood no these are things that are said to help us to understand all right now back to Matthew 5 48. it says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and the Bible also says unless you're righteous unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness right another scribes and Republicans describes and Pharisees right right and have you ever thought about one that says Christ looked like it would have said Sadducees in in Pharisees right come on it looked like it would have said sadly season Pharisees because that would have covered the two groups man all right my dad left everybody else out yes right so he said unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes just the fellas that wrote down times this is the guy sitting in the corner that never had anything to do but right and every day he wrote and they say every time he would come to that word God he glazed him down go take a bath and come back and start writing they say this actually probably what happened to Lazarus the reason that he died he took so many bastards he and writing the Bible I miss it that's what they're saying I don't know it's a good point but my point is it didn't say the fair season said you see because that would have been to two religious gods right Joy putting the scribes where it would just be me and you you know everybody because they had a righteousness too amen under the atonement right amen but unless our righteousness exceeds that now how can our righteousness exceed those guys wind that's what I said that guy with natural muscle he probably take a bath every time you see the word God and they don't ride it out they got their code will say it all right but then the high priest would be killed for any sin he committed to unless our righteousness exceeds that what can we do now how can it exceed that right well I'm forgiven brother Dale and maybe you're getting me lined up a little bit but I can see that I'm perfect but I'm not righteous let's look up the word righteous that's right amen amen it means to be right right man simple amen you don't have to find all these great big words to describe everything just look it up righteousness means the state of being right well if you're forgiven you're right amen but of course we don't believe in that because we don't forgive all right we forgive but we don't forget then we say well let him ask me to forgive him I'll forgiven that's not Bible according to mark which we cover has to be in the speaking of the word saying to this mountain he goes on down a little further there and says if you won't forgive you won't be forgiven that's right yeah but we don't want that we don't speak the word speak the word you know we'll forgive right right amen that's right but you can't be forgiven if you want all right and you're not going to come to speak into the word right right see this is going away on down to message I mean I just drop in a little bit along the way amen all right but look look what brother Brown had to say on it go ahead Brazil number three the thoughts are being perfect the thoughts are being perfect amen now watch what he says this is off the first seal 1963-18 ever born again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless amen he's not trusting in his Works come on in the blood of Jesus Christ and his confessions dropped into the Bible says so you know a lot of people read and they put their definitions and and they I'm not arguing with him about they the way they say things but if you read that naturally across her and you've got a problem amen so you ought to read by Revelation and sit across what you read right let me read that to you and see what you say every morning again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God he's not trusting in his works in the blood of Jesus Christ and his confession dropped into it that'll look like right around said he's not trusting him I quoted all in one sentence make sure to stop that and broke it up into two sentences but they only put a comma I didn't break it down just separated that a long way to put me some branches around it if you see what I'm talking about they put the computer and I had to put a parenthesis around this thing because it looked like brother random would be saying that you're not trusting no we're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ you see you say well I said what brought around said run around and said that I'm not pressing in the blood of Jesus Christ he didn't say that amen that's two different sentences not the way we read okay the Bible says so see he that that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin after you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and between him and God that would scatter sin Till There be nothing left of it right see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let his sin pass there he cannot Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and how could we ever start the thought of being perfect but Jesus required it if Jesus required it he's got to make a way for it and he has his own blood that's right yeah now that's why job see he could see that he was right right now you understand what brother Brown would come along and even eliu the Chrysler would rebuke Joseph you see Joe couldn't see Christ the way he wanted to see but once he made his stand then he seen Christ did I know my redeemer lived but when he was in his own self he could only see I'm not guilty right he couldn't see that somebody had to come and if that somebody didn't come to take job's atonement confession and bring him before God through the Lord Jesus Christ he was in self-righteousness are you listening see he had he was looking he wasn't looking for somebody else to come right come on read the book a joke man he wasn't looking for somebody else to come but once he's seen God's moving up and then he said I know my redeemer a little bit seeing one that would come that would not only cover his sins but we're eradicate them right amen well that guy couldn't eradicates right right man but Iran uses the word divorce we'll get to it right all right you couldn't be divorced in the Old Testament man right he couldn't be eradicated see do we have the house some way to make it if he requires for us to be perfect he had to make a way good to make some Brother John you had to make the neck that's perfect right this is unless you call Perfection 1957. well I hope this soaks way down deep now look God knows he had sheep and it's working he knowed he was going to have a people to be saved and his love looked down and seen those who would be saved their four by four knowledge he predestinated the church to meet him Yonder without spot or wrinkle and if God required a church without much now Sparta wrinkled he had to have something to make it that way he could not require his Justice his judgment could not let him ask such a thing if there wasn't a way to make it amen right he made the way amen that job that was perfect because he was innocent yeah not guilty and even if you sinned and he forgives you you're not guilty you're perfect amen could it no difference and not guilty and perfect but see job didn't see one to come until the Bell strung on him until the Lord got to it then he seen it amen right amen he seen the Redeemer coming all right amen didn't even make that statement isn't it he couldn't do it until God wrote it back and he seen the one that was to eradicate his sins right because you didn't have any all right he didn't have any to eradicate there was already covered amen amen but you see it was this it was what he had to go through Jesus Christ had to make a way through his blood that's right to take those that were not perfect in their natural right but bring them to a point that he had said they were perfect under his atonement right within when the atonement came the atonement right right okay which was God himself and he in human flesh see then when it happened joke seen him coming and he knew his sins was eradicated who didn't have any trouble in the resurrection that's right he was able to rise in the resurrection man why because the perfect one had come and eradicated sin amen well now if he eradicated it that way come on I like to do this I know I mean I'm hateful I love to preach it too I like to get you out on a limb where you'll let him in at least shake your head coach brother Donnie says that's good amen but at least you have to agree what to say he doesn't like to come up with a statement yeah if we believe he eradicated for them if he didn't do it all at one time he's got to come back and die again are you listening if he only eradicated their sins if he didn't eradicate ours right man he's not to come back and die again and according to my Bible he doesn't do it right according to my Bible he died one time and he will be eradicated why are we concerned with this way right man amen you sure look it was like that then I'm just living like the devil go ahead come on amen yeah bless who you are amen oh you're preaching a greasy Grace you don't just do anything no I'm not man because see you don't follow me everybody don't hear me all the time I don't believe everybody in the Old Testament they took a lamb and walked up I preached it to you for 40 years I've got to take a lamb walk up and throw it down turn around and walk off say I'm forgive me I don't believe he was amen he was capabled by the one atonement that was made for Israel but that sin remained come on we'll get down to where we was with Moses in a minute that sin remains you see him saying there's a Christian the prophet but God says you will reap a toad before now that's your prostitute because I can just go out and live like the devil go ahead because if you're a Christian you got a robe full of helpful to get on you right because every devil in hell is going to come after you so we're here well I got bad with that Lord didn't that's what he thought yeah he's taught in the garden because God didn't come down she thought she got by but he was right he said today you eaten around so she never lived a thousand years amen he was right she was the one that hadn't messed up where do you follow him see then the Old Testament people according to the fact that they would accept what God Said to them and do it sincerely because you remember we bring it out the other day he got where he said you're you're sacrificing offers you become a streak in my mouth right yeah come on that's what God had to say about it right right but you see a man he said who'd I Look to a man with an honest and a sincere heart that's right amen who feareth God and when his order to shoot us another word goes away from evil so you go ahead and think you can just live like the devil long you want to because you're that's a good old Baptist once saved always saved right I didn't believe that not the Baptist Church as a deacon for there for five years and I didn't believe it then and I certainly don't believe it now right right man standing I told you about a no because standing out there one day looking at these women walking down through there I said sir I said that's not right he said oh the Bible says look on God's heritage he was old enough to be my daddy matter of fact the worst came through I looked at him and I'm in it just as much as I mean today I said it don't say lust after they don't say that see I was against it then I'm certainly against sin today people think that I'm trying to preach some kind of a greasy Grace no you seen a sin as a Christian you'll reap It Up full fight that's me you and everybody come on even your prophet amen said a word to his wife there one day and went over to pray for a baby and God come down and says you go make that right or not to his wife about to it was to his wife but it was about the income tax guy tell him I'm not here you take your hand off that baby he went and made it right and he come back said give me the baby now remember what happened and listen then they had to believe now that's my emphasis the people of the Old Testament had to believe right right it wasn't just offering off right that's why I believe that it said many it doesn't say all the Old Testament changed it just says many of them well where's the other if meaning was 99 but still one percent amen right right see because it their atonement was not accepted for them amen that's right but they were covered by the blood of the sacrificial lamb just like today the prophet of God said there is a buffered blood of the blood of Jesus Christ that covers this world and if it wasn't for that we would be annihilate it come on we're still here taking care of us amen right even though you say you're a Christian they ain't sin in 40 years that's what Jack Cole said that lady told him that he said lady sit down shut up you're the biggest sinner here that was a good point amen I like what he said there one time he told the lady said I want to lay my tongue out on this altar because I got a long tongue he said Lady it's only 14 foot ain't enough all over here he was tough but he was right see church we must accept what God Said all right now get to Point what I'm saying they had to accept that lamb was dying for them blood around said you laid your hands on the animal right and said when they cut it the blood was frailing all over you amen and said you believe it's your sins was transmitted to that animal right man now it's not just haphazard just do it I'll send it up by Joe he's okay let him take it on for me no won't work Joe with it amen that'll be ourselves right but listen if we believe it that way then why would we believe in any formal thinking that under the blood of Jesus Christ we could go out and live like the devil and get my way come on Amen if you don't see what I believe about it you've got a mental capacity problem what I'm saying under the blood of bulls and goats they believed in it we might flee Jesus Christ paid the price amen sure you make a mistake hoping brother Brown you don't like me no we'll quote him right around you sin he said every day is that a quote amen amen what he said he said I see him every day really random did you disbelieve no no no sin has degrees up and down we've reset for 40 years you ought to know it it was a little mistakes he made in life right but they're still singing right when my Bible said that anything is not a faith is what sin that's right so you see where we're at seeing that if you magnify it under the New Testament like I said lust and back tire wouldn't they're not making a tone for luster there may be atonement for doing it we've got to make this and we got to have an atonement for the thinking about it right you remember what I was trying to bring out learn the scripture in Exodus 32. where the when the children of Israel made a golden Cali go down and read there about the 30th verse from 32 chapter 32 where Moses said pre-adventure I shall go up and make an atonement man I want you to show me what animal he offered all right come on all right you know my Bible search the rest of the scripture if you want to there's no record he offered any animal all right that's right you know what he done he reminded God nice mom wrote around and said and I always wondered how Moses could tell a god a better way of doing something he said if I found out it was Christ amen he never sacrificed one animal up there Moses did he didn't take nothing up no blood went up he went up himself and he went before God and he said God that's right if you destroy them destroy me then run around and puts that scripture together with the other scripture word that he's relating it that Moses reminds God or one of them reminds God there said it would be said that you could bring him out but you can't take them in amen he reminded him of his word that's why I asked you the question I keep asking it which is right do we believe in the atonement that covers sin or does God's word cover sin come on natural I know what I preached to you we got to make the atonement it was made but who forgave Adam and Eve right before Adam and Eve stood before God is centered right right and God offered to sacrifice but his word that he said in heaven right that's right amen so when God says the atonement is what I say that's what he says that's right when he says you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's exactly what he meant amen all right by his word amen that's what I'm trying to get you to see I'm trying to get you to see one thing we got to believe what man said amen that's right don't quote right around him he said I already get one man believe what another man say yes amen right it's when we have trouble with the Bible oh shut up father son Holy Ghost said all kind of things security Baptist Bible convert them to baptist Faith what you do I still believe every word in here I said and I couldn't find out that there's a lot of things I didn't that the Bible didn't say that I believed right right but listen you know man wrote this right yeah right no no my brother Dave you don't understand God no come on I know you were out no sense no that's what I'm talking about you want to go back to the history of the writing of the the King James version with me set them down and gave them the little Scrolls and said translate it amen and when they came out to translate it from the Greek and the things of the New Testament not even the old but the new when they came out to do that if it didn't compare exactly they threw that now amen but when they came up with all of the groups and you know it had to be the holy spirit amen so my Bible said the Holy Ghost let right he led them to write it all right amen right sure but a man wrote it down and then a man came in the last day Hallelujah to tell us what did they said that's right man a man goes out in Arizona I mean I turned he goes up and he gets the grace of marriage in divorce amen well everybody wants to believe that they don't believe those things he said they ain't gonna deny that one oh yeah yeah he set me free yeah yeah the words of a man amen right you said brother your carnal how much carnal Moses was a man right and Moses said God you destroy them you got to destroy me first that's right I was a man he said God I'll remind you you said you're going to take a man all right amen and you know that wasn't there it was a cross that Moses didn't get to go in because we called her smiling the rock but tonight he went over here always in the temple right by the side of Moses read your Bible he stayed there Moses said you stay in the temple why he had to learn about a God that would hear the words of a man man all right come on God would hear the word to a man and that man could stand her as God for the people amen am I quoting brother ran right he said while Moses were speaking he was God he said when he fell back he was Moses so that didn't make him her God brother random was telling us the message he was God but when he stepped back he's brother Brown yeah amen he's not my God these two back here behind a lot of people don't understand why I have him there a lot of people don't even know the story of of Michelangelo he painted a picture of of Jesus Christ at 30 years of age this is the one over here excuse me there's nowhere no that's right over here 30 years of age he paid him one at 33. you come and look Kaufman I might send it wrong but you know what I like because I'm in the middle that's what happened to that man to break me that's why they're back there he looked like he's over 50 years old in the last one even the story is that Hoffman wrote in in the inability to paint because of the lines were so perfect after it but he painted two pictures one of thirty and one of 33. it took you and I had to make that that's right yeah it made him a sinner for me he said but Hebrews 1 says yeah that's what I like Hebrews 1 said God in tundra time in diverse manners fake by but how did the prophet translate it in right amen you had to believe that man was God's future when I wrote around and said some things was wrong they're saying today I know he did when he said when I was right or I agree because there was nobody could correct him amen before they're good at it now but they wouldn't nobody could correct him amen because the sealed has not been broke he stands before God but he stands between us and God right amen like I said we're glad to say the grace of marriage endorse is mine but then when he says that Jesus was almighty God then they want to make him a man they want to make him a second person yeah they want to make him another identity these brothers what they're saying but you understand going on with it I'm sorry God I just can't see it in the Bible it's just like we're good to it this afternoon you know that running around and said if you don't believe you're perfect you'll get it this afternoon amen he said if you don't believe you're perfect you're lost right that's right solve it let him say it all right we'll get back this afternoon in case you miss it it's on the last book of life look like I'll give it to education money you don't get to come back in the last book of life 1956 uh 607 paragraph e35 he said if you don't believe you're perfect you're lost that's right so we're either lost or saved that's it we'll get to that you see you're either a sinner or a sign and there is no white black bird right okay I thought I'd have some questions about what the brother said during this past Wednesday I thought some of your sisters would be asking me about that do you remember how you brought it out he's bringing out how's it the women you know and how they're supposed to be not supposed to be subjects in all things well now you can make that say what you want to right amen I think the brother said it right yeah I didn't argue with him that's right I just thought some of you come up say you mean I got to be in subject and everything because you already know what I preached you already know wrote a brown said a woman know how to be subject to the man if he tries to get her to do something contrary to the word amen right right we've done preached that okay she don't have to do wrong things because he says that says it for her to do it right that's right amen amen she don't have to be on the subject but at the same time yes sir that's right she can't refuse to be his wife amen amen she's under subjection she'll be his wife to cook to bed and all is said amen amen without enough to rhyme you know man hello all right get you to laugh because that makes you remember it but she used to be under subjection in all things amen that is not contrary to work because you know what I've said to you see your husband tells you do something this country the word you say a little devil don't tell me I don't have to do that now that's not right that he tells you to cook him something to eat and you say bless Garden like I told sister or sister Cooney sister truly Rucker drive 250 miles to get down here and I spoke right straight to her place right over there one day I said you go home and you get back home after driving five hours you walk in the house right if he tells you you can't go to church where you want to because it's a better word then you don't have to obey amen see you can say in all things in the legs a big old open space don't you man man down at work one day was telling me that and he wouldn't even believe her this message she's supposed to do it I know I'm carnal I'm sorry I just said you mean tell me if you tell your wife you got to go come into adultery she's got to go do it and he said yes sir I said you lying hypocrite amen I said you ain't nothing with the devil yeah that's right oh let me back up all right I said you remember the devil thinking something like that amen I said cheap to be under subjection to you as my wife is to a husband all right and but not because you go tell her to do something I thought I'd get that truck cover it okay but now listen see we're talking about the word yeah that's when we read in John that knows disciples come to Jesus the story lies you know and all the things unless you need to flesh that's on the man all the different things a lot of people walked away he turned to the 12 and he said and I've got your quotes here if you want we'll probably have time to read them but you know what right around said he he turned to them he said why don't you go to amen or why don't you go so well also or do you want to go it makes it what amen were right into the next brother you'll Escape how can I have this thing if I cut the other fuel number five let's see what it is I went on a relief I gotta read this and cut away listen what you probably had to say on the message to whom would we go 1960 606 because Peter had found something in Jesus that isn't in other men that's the reason he said to whom would we go Now read it right he didn't say where will we go right I like that all right all right now I did another quote wrote around says and he was mentioned he'd be going along and he said where do we go but look what he's just saying why did he say it like that he didn't say where will we go amen because that means you leave this church and go to that church and go over here and you go over there you go here a while you go there well you run here where do we go no no you didn't say where we know he said to whom will we go all right amen exactly not changing Church it ain't no problem because we go to him which is the word amen the prophet of God said the only reason you have to leave your church is be called the demand got off the word amen I mean not to worry but to whom amen now that's the words of eternal life amen I told you this is still the Old Testament now that's the words of eternal life he act like the other man didn't have that's what made the difference all right man get in the word so eternal life there was that Christ that was standing in Moses amen right you could tell God a better way of doing something inside of that man not the flesh come on man but inside of that man was the same God amen who were to whom shall we know that not where do we go we go to the word all right amen that's right not man following stuff it's the word that's right yeah exactly see God used a man to speak and honored his word I gave you the quotes where I wrote around and said that he could not go over Moses read it if you want it I'll be glad to give them to you he said he commissioned Moses for the job he said thereby couldn't go over him right that's right that's right around his words amen you couldn't go over Moses because he ordained him to lead him through he said he didn't lead him through he only got it so far he got him that far how far have you been amen you at least got him to the land amen all right I like it that way brother one time told me here said God told me to come to the Lord where there's a Moses Ministry I said yep you're here now this Moses if you're going to try to top me don't do it because Moses died so I don't do that but I said second off now Joshua was going to take you over because brother Dale can't do it he can lead you to the land but he can't take it in amen I can tell you the message but I can't I can't interpret it to you all right man the Holy Ghost is the only interpreter in the world can we see where we're at right until the disciples said we go amen thou Hast the words that's right Moses went before God and spoke the words of eternal life amen come on you didn't make the people eternally he spoken about because God said I'll kill him when I get ready listen I'll let it go now right amen right read your Bible he said I'll let it go but he said when the day comes I'll deal with that amen see run around Kane with the words of eternal life I like to really arrested these numbers for later the words of eternal life that's something to me right I just felt like that that's a million bucks to me amen right right the words are eternal life right amen this message wrote eternal life to me amen and come on now as a deacon for five years I joined the church when I was 18. I was teaching when I left the adult Sunday School classes which was the deakers and deacons and elders and their wives and I was 20 no 10 years ago I was a deacon at 23 years old so you know they had a lot of respect about it and you know what when I came into this message you heard me tell that I've read six books a day and listened to two types all in one day not every day but I've done it really colleague and witness because he used to be right there with him and I just sitting there and made it my wife and them could witness it neighbor said another here the other day he's up the house Phil was doing something he said I remember when we used to walk through the house here and that man preach that's a neighbor's boy and we play tapes we listen to the message but you know when I come in this message actually and I didn't have eternal life I didn't do what 98 of the people of this message say I know I had eternal life or I wouldn't have come to the message when I seen the message I know that I didn't have eternal life and yet I was justified and Sanctified I know that I knew that part I knew God was in my life and I knew things and seen things you heard me to it seen things that the people in this message would love to see today but yet I knew I didn't have eternal life you know what I didn't have the words of eternal life right what do you mean you read the Bible no I read it with the wrong prices amen right you did too the Bible never said baptized father son and I want to go and the Bible never said hell was eternal ever said these things right that's what we read right and when I seen that and I've seen where he was explaining then the birth is the birth of the word right and Hugh Matthew was right when he said the story right forth and soul and the seed and the life and some came to life and I knew right then I didn't have anywhere every time an all the call was given I was in the altar crying two years well you do believe yeah come on folks amen you know the way I preach now that's the way I talk now my son I'm sitting right there when he's 12 13 years old I put in his 90 of the preacher that was in this message as far as being able to quote run around and quote him correctly and go back up I say what I mean and I mean what I say because it was true he came to me after he come back to the Lord he come to me and said brother Daddy what does this mean I said it means so enjoy he said how come I had to talk I said cause he's been laying there ever since you read it amen waiting on to be made alive man I'm trying you didn't come to me and I said okay now my son all you need to do is y'all don't start preaching no you come to me I said you need God you need the Holy Ghost and he saw God in July not Daddy telling me God told me you're gonna be standing in the puppy and I had witnessed in my life I told her I told her I said don't you tell nobody just forbidden to mention it to anyone amen one day he couldn't do it he said Daddy I want to talk to you I said you don't want to talk to me most preachers in this message with a son coming up like that would say son you're preaching Sunday I said no you don't want to talk to me you got to talk to your daddy amen the one you found out to be your real daddy you go talk to him about it but I said run son until God runs you down about eight months later he comes he said Daddy I'm ready I said you preaching Sunday amen why because I don't believe in playing all right man I knew I didn't have the new birth but that's all I wanted and I packed every word I could get in there see because then I knew I had come to the words of eternal life amen that's right brother Brown says the Bible says repent everyone up and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and then you shall he said and God's obligated amen when it's obligated to everybody that reads that and says it all right no that's right no way he's obligated to the one that sees that and believes it in his heart into being real and life give the word to eternal life all right man then it becomes eternal life when God quickens it oh but brother Dale I believe I come in this world with eternal life where'd you get it come on I thought it was to come through Jesus Christ that's right amen and Abraham would have had it Motors would have had it no you see Church eternal life is the word Made Alive and Jesus had the words of eternal life all right the whole world of religious forms was waiting on the man that could say right have the words of eternal life sure and somebody could get it after then when it was bottled up in one man right all right man he had to go pay the price amen he could plant the seed but he had to pay the price amen he paid the price that the life could come back on the scene but he had the words of eternal life to lay out into them that's why Peter goes on to the next verse and said Thou Art the Christ all right amen mind because it was quick and unintuitive right right amen it could be quicker than to you you can get a revelation without being born again but it's only for the time that didn't give Peter eternal life he had to go to Pentecost right Amen brother run said it was phased for the time talking about the little woman you know face for the time you can have faith for the time Abraham did one of these days I don't want to preach them or something come on music you know I told sister trivia I'm going to preach one of these days what brought around made a statement it's always boy with me he said to discernment you see you know everybody wants to make it some kind of a fiction of his mouth some kind of or something some kind of a doing you know what he said it was he said it was a revelation brother Brown said it was a revelation amen God revealed it back to him no only South Asians he didn't see Visions Jesus didn't see visions I do nothing till the father shows me brother when I said he saw a vision all right then we'd like to die if he didn't do nothing to see the vision no that wouldn't I a lot of things happened that he didn't see an open Vision like this right he saw vision from inside again right right that's why I wrote around and said nobody can argue about this and I'm telling you now he said because he's revealed amen the Bible says without a vision you perish I mean here's the invasion some of you have but everybody in here can't raise your hand and say they've seen a vision right right so you're perished that's where everybody preaches it ain't it no if you've seen a revelation you've got a revelation of one true believing God that was a vision not to see it out there amen but Ephesians inside of you the words of eternal life amen hallelujah let's come to an individual man right now you can have a new testament you can't go from where we was in the Old Testament to the new without having the words of eternal life standing right there with the ability to give his life must stand look at he could give his life and when he could give his life then he could bring eternal life to you and I that's right the words of eternal life they argue about Jesus and they say part of his word was read my part it was logos I don't have enough sense to argue about that I just believe what he said he said one day he said my words your spirit in their life amen when he said Harry that old Fox you're going to say that with God come on you're gonna said it wouldn't God talking so you don't want to say one time I was a man that brought around God speaking one down in my hands feet booing the man speaking who was he that's right you see what I'm talking about the words of eternal life a man standing on Earth 2 000 years ago right into you and I the words of eternal life that's right no wonder this man could withstand in life's days and talk about a third pool yep where he was challenged to speak the word he said not what is written that's right he spoke the word because he had it within his possession the words of eternal life that's right that's what I believe about this message you say anybody yeah but he speaks according to my Revelation go ahead 372 inspirable you say where who are you well who are you you want to be able to say it too amen right it's been revealed to me right man that's why you can't take it away from us anybody have a name I had no experiences everybody
