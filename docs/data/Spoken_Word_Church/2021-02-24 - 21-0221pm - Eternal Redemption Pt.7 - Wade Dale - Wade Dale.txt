then we ain't far from it when that song was pinned there probably was a lot of years waiting but now there's not a lot of years waiting the reality is here hey man i i know we believe that we see it if you got your bibles you want to uh let me get the announcements out of the way brother aaron will be preaching wins tonight okay get your shield yep get your face shield um brother aaron we'll be preaching wednesday night uh ladies will be meeting afterwards to uh figure out what they're gonna do um i was looking back on our um father's day trip and i what we had done is i had forgot but i looked back we're gonna be there wednesday we've got it for wednesday night thursday night friday night not just thursday night and friday night because we didn't have a good length of time to to go and i think the sisters are going to do that also and i know it's june but still i'm going to announce it because somebody will forget it but june the 17th so we're going to have church service on tuesday night that week well the dale's lit so the sisters can do what they do and we what we were going to do i know i remember we talked about last time is was going to get there at four o'clock and then some of us you know we the ones that opened up the cabin will come back down here church wednesday but if we'll have church on tuesday then we'll just get up there wednesday we'll have wednesday night the sisters will have time to get there on wednesday um and thursday and friday and come back saturday at about 11 or 12 o'clock so just keep that in your heart i'll call brother chris long he and brother ronnie his son is going to be here with us so i'll tell them they need to be here on tuesday not wednesday so for us to leave on wednesday at 4 o'clock so just keep that in your mind also remember brother kern again he's uh was uh diagnosed with the virus but he's doing better so we ask that you just keep him in your prayers also remember communion right after service well the kern is setting outside so that's all right amen that's good [Applause] and that brings me to number one thing i want to since we're getting all back to church again i want to read you a couple of quotes for brother adam i know we all getting back to church again and everything we um i always when i i was always a manager when i was growing up and never was much just a i was a laborer or some but when you when you become a manager and take a position you have certain responsibilities brother brown said we're not an organization we're an organism an organism is a whole within interdependent parts brother brown said in church age of church at church order in 1958 he said may every officer of the church fill his post of duty knowing this that god is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office in the church each one will have to give an account brother man said 1961 wasn't so from the beginning i think every person ought to be at your post of duty when your church is open that's correct that's exact you should stand by your pastor and stand by your board and stand by your church brother brahma 1962 he said we always want the people to stay at their post of duty now what he's doing he's announcing church services somewhere else he said but if your church is open you be at your post of duty now listen posted duty to me means you've got an office like i said about management when you get into management you're required listen if one of my trucks didn't get out if one of my employees didn't come in when i owned a trucking company guess who drove the truck okay i stayed and drove the truck i didn't galavan off somewhere and take a vacation okay everybody got that when your church is open every soldier ought to be at his rank and in his place brother brown said 1963 perseverance now if you have a post of duty you go there that's what you're supposed to do always stand at your posted duty that's your duty to god and pastor and the rest of your congregation okay so if you got an office in this church you should be here now we know as brother dale said this morning it's good to get these people out preaching these young brothers out preaching but don't everybody leave it at one time you've got a post of duty right here now if you're preaching somewhere that's different but just go out fellowshipping gallivanting around that's not right if you have a post and a job to do now brother chris the only post that he's got to do is sit in that seat right there and he said okay that's fine now if he goes off and wants to visit the brother so-and-so's church that's okay but just let us know oh yeah listen y'all can get on facebook and talk about your dog having diarrhea but you can't tell your pastor that you ain't going to be here he's the one you need to tell if you're a minister if you're a song leader or any kind of musician tell brother joe canada tell me we're right here but i will always if i'm the only me and brother dale's only two people here i'm i'm staying here even if i have something i have to do because this is my post of duty now we do go out and preach but we make sure we have a backup plan like brother um brother branham said he said we're an organism an organization organism has independent interdependent parts if you have a part in this church you need to be here when the doors are open i'm just reading quotes and you should be able to do that anyway that should be now if you don't want to be resign if you don't want to be and that's okay too sometimes i hated being a manager i wanted to resign i want to just be where i go in and go give me do my eight hours and let me go back home i wasn't built for that i guess because i never was able to do that except a long long time ago at mcdonald's but i have if you have a post of duty you have a responsibility not to another church to this church does not say that you don't need to go out and go to fellowship meetings that's not but if i'm reading quotes brother brown said if you have a church to go to and it's open you need to be here i think that's really simple but some of us are get oversimplified every once in a while and have to be told that it's wrong to do those things so it's it and and it reflects because you know what it does if you have a job here and we look around and we see empty seats here we see all the preachers gone and nobody's here you know what it does we start asking well where's so-and-so and where's so-and-so and if nobody knows where so-and-so is we got a problem i don't want to know your business but if you got business in this church everybody understand what i'm saying if you got to post to duty if you ain't going to be here don't pull the burley williams and call it 8 o'clock on saturday night he's and he don't care if i tell him he knows that he's called me at 8 o'clock at night he's already in ohio gonna preach sunday and he wants me to preach for him the next more that morning so we know better than that we just don't get up on sunday morning to go i think i'll go church somewhere else well if you do then that's okay but if you have an office in this church you should not do that this is your post of duty right here and if like i said again if you don't want to do that it's not going to hurt our feelings now i'm talking me and brother dale we already discussed this you got to have opposed to duty filled look back here today and i saw empty seats there was nobody playing a guitar there was nobody playing this what are we doing you should want to fill a place you should want to fill a position if you don't then that's okay do like brother chris come to church shave your head come to church and come to work and then smiling eyes is all i see but you know what brother chris is happy that and i'm happy with to see him here because that's his post of duty brother brown said even just sitting in a pew but we miss you when you're gone i'm trying to make it a little bit funny but we do miss you when you're gone and we do wonder not to be nosy but you never know you don't you just say wow where you been what you've been doing just reading what the prophet said but this this church we get we're getting back to doing things i know and i was thinking yesterday we have become so i i don't even remember last year very much just things went by and it was all abnormal and we didn't do this and we didn't do that and now we're trying to get some normalcy back so it just sometimes it takes a little bit of shaking to get us back into our into our routine and i hope and pray that we get back into uh sunday school and bible study and all those things because i long for that whether you do or not i long to get together and talk about the word of god i don't i don't like to stand separate because you know what the devil likes for us to stay separate yeah man he likes for us to stay away from each other you know why because he's got more time in your brain but when you got people around you they're uplifting and building you up and talking about the word of god and talking about what god's done in your life then you know what the devil has no place there he hates that and i love that because he leaves because resist the devil and he'll leave and flee from you so just take that to take that to heart just remember if you have a posted duty you need to be here that's just pretty simple you got a job if you don't want the job somebody else may else want it but brother brown said you're you're responsible to god not to brother dale you're responsible to god for what you do so so let's just all be careful and do the right thing so god bless you just wanted to kind of get like i said we're starting back together getting things back in where everybody's coming up front now and make sure we all wear a mask and and and keep the uh keep this thing out of here so lord bless you and let's bow our head the heavenly father we thank you for the day that we're living and the time we have to be here forgive us of our faults and our many mistakes that we make lord i pray today that you would be the active participant in this service lord you do the speaking thank you father for the song service and the specials lord the different things the players lord we truly are an organism and we can't we can't have two hearts two lungs two livers and all those different things lord we have one heart that functions we have a set of lungs lord we have people that function here lord and and being holy ghost filled people father we we pray that we'll do the things that are acceptable to you father give us this dare our daily bread just be with each one that's on the highways the ones that are traveling lord be with our pastor keep him safe be a brother current out there lord bless his heart out wanted to come to church so bad i pray that you would put that fire in every one of our heart every one of our hearts lord that we want to be here more than we want to be sick father we pray that you'll just be with us now and take care of us in jesus name amen you know some people would rather be i saw a thing yesterday a sign somewhere says some people would rather be sick than well and they would because they wanted nothing to complain about hebrews 9 verse 11 we're still on eternal redemption and we're going to get a little bit into the um the first three dimensions and i i got a little thought i want to share with you that you and i are living in three dimensions right the time life and matter we talked about that a little bit on wednesday but you remember you're in a three-part person body spirit and soul so you've got and those are to connect you to this world and to the other world to another dimension amen and we'll talk about that in a minute we'll read some of the things that brother brown said about that that by christ being a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of bull goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord at his blessing reading the word let's read number one real quick we've got to take communion today so we won't be very long job the oldest book in the bible was supposed to even be written before moses wrote genesis but the oldest book in the bible was speaking of redemption yet redemption was far way before that you know i was thinking also yesterday when god was writing his first bible when he looked down through time by foreknowledge he had to step out of eternity and look into time because that's what he's writing he's writing about our journey in moses's journey moses wasn't up in heaven as a person he was down here so god can move through what i'm saying is god can move through any dimension like brother dale was preaching this morning jesus christ before he was glorified everybody understand what i'm saying before he went to the cross before he had a body change he couldn't walk through a wall he was limited by the time life and matter that he came down in he was an eternal person but now when he came back after the resurrection he appears to the to the disciples and he just walked through the wall brother brown said he went through so fast so the adam just broke up and then he came what then he became solid again because they said oh he's a ghost and they said he said give me some fish where'd that fish go it went into his body all right so that's what we're looking at is that when we see this that god wrote this plan of redemption he had to go ahead and look in he had to go drop into time watch everything that went on in time and then pull back up into eternity to write the bible because that's what he's writing about our this right here if this was the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world in the mind of god that had to happen but he had to see it it had to be in his thoughts how many of you have vivid thoughts and vivid imaginations and boy some of you i know do known you for a while what are you laughing bless your heart she can't call me old man in just a few months she'll be as old as me bless her heart but redemption is one of the oldest things in the bible redemption was even plan of redemption was laid out before the world was ever formed think of god see foreseeing for knowledge and making a way of redemption before he even made the world so he dropped down into time watched time through all these six or seven thousand years that he's watched time or longer and then now he popped back up eternity but remember he's an eternal being he can do that he's omnipotent he's omniscient he's omnipresent he has no limitations he's an unlimited god but he decided to limit him limit himself to come down here in human flesh as brother dale's talking about that same creator come down into this real slow first three dimensions and became a body of spirit and soul for the plan of redemption to be fulfilled all right so now because titus watched titus 1 verse 1 it says in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began the bible said who did he swear by he swore by himself so he is the orchestrator and he is the master scientist he's the master of everything because he's the one that done it but you and i have to do what by the fall we were detached from god now we gotta get back attached back to god but we know that how do you do it through preaching that's paul but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our savior and i uh brother dale is a he's he's always been my dad but he's always been a positive guy and he brings that positivity that is a word look it up google it he brings that positivity into the into the message of the hour where it's not so wild you as you wound doom and gloom why because that's the way i think god is god's not sure he got he got ill at people he got mad right got angry got jealous god's got all these attributes that we think no that's just reserved for human beings no he said i am a jealous god right that's right i am a loving god i don't know it's only one and i'm it is right that's what he said he said there's no other god beside me there's no word of god before me i am the only god now he can say that because he backed it up but through preaching and through the baptism of holy ghost you can say the same thing that you are a part of god the same part of god that said let there be light the same part of god that that created man in his own image because you're the image that he created you know brother ray you're the very living living image of that genesis 1 26 man that's why i love it so much if you'll connect yourself to that that's your image and god created you put your name i don't care if you're a sister too put your name in god created wade in his own image in an image of it just got separated by the fall so that he could be a redeemer so they could be a healer so that he could be a savior because he had those groaning attributes inside of him and they had to the only way as brother luis read the quote a long time ago the only way that god could fulfill his correct and full purpose is to become human flesh that's right it was listen i don't want y'all to get the idea that god said oh man i got to go down there now and get human and that was the whole plan right right he was he loved it you don't take my life he said i give it amen he didn't die the roman spear didn't kill him the roman nails didn't kill him he said into the hens i command my spirit he died when he wanted to when he had to he was in complete control on that cross and thank god you and i were there with him amen all right so ephesians 1 we know paul speaking of ephesians in verse 4 according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world not chosen of him but chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having what predestinated us into the adoption of children now what is adoption adoption is what the placing of a child the organism that we're talking about brother brown said four people can't be a a heart one heart but you can be a kidney you can be a pinky you can be a little you can be a partner you can be an arm you can be a leg because that's the body of god the body of god is not just one big heart the body of god is feet toes legs and all the way up to the neck and that's what you need to find out where you're at and get in it that's your post of duty somebody somebody's posting duty in this church is to pray for us every week that you'll get a good sermon from god amen oh that's just that's the bet brother brown said how the success of my meetings is what your prayers he said two women remember the two old ladies he said they prayed in that closet and he said i had success because of their prayer wow to me that's supposed to duty but they knew what it was and they got into it they got an unction from god and they started praying how many of you prayed for a good service amen you should pray for a good service why would you not what do you come here for if you're not praying for good service we need to fellowship with god to the praise of the glory of his grace when he hath accepted us in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness is what sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence have been made known unto us so there's something as brother dale was talking this morning there was something that god was going to make known now he was going to make no the father was going to declare the son and the bible says the son declared the father where were we inside that sun so what happened he in morphed on the day of pentecost it didn't do away with that son because that son of god came back on the day of pentecost inside the people and inside your pentecost on your day of pentecost he came inside of you but you and i live under the open book the son of man showing that this thing can be redeemed right here luther couldn't do it because luther laid in the floor and beat himself with whips trying to get this thing and his thoughts lined up with god couldn't happen he was under justification but still the longing was there right the longing was there even under luther coming out of catholicism his longing was was to be better and to be a christian and not be what he was what he saw back in the do you do the same thing i don't want to be what i was six months ago eight months ago three months ago and you know what we all got denominational ideas hello all of us do so thank god he's got us out of that that's thinking thinking we're talking about now look that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together what this organism this body of christ he's going to bring it in together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him i want you to pay attention to that heaven and earth because we're going to get something in just a minute whom also we have obtained an inheritance in other words no you didn't have anything to do with god calling you but you did have something to do with answering him amen you have nothing to do many are called fewer chosen god's god wills that no one be lost but he knows who will accept it and walk in it and he knows who will not we don't that's why brother they said brother brown will you preach why do you even preach if everything's you know in other words there you go that predestination cut and dry he said i don't know who's saved and who's not saved he said i keep preaching the gospel throw the net out there i might get snakes i might get frogs but i get a couple of fish every once in a while amen because in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being procrastinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will let's read romans 8 28 and we know all things work together for good to them that love god to them that are they called according to its purpose this is just a little bit more on four knowledge for whom he did for no thereby understand what we're talking about foreknowledge is first f-o-r-e-4 b4 before god could predestinate he had to have knowledge of what he's going to predetermine everybody got that he had four knowledge he stood here in time and he watched everything unfold he said all right this is what's going to happen this is the way it's going to be but remember he didn't come down here and influence you or anyone else more than he did anyone else because he's not a respecter of persons he saw what your choice would be and you know what he done he also knew that your choice would be when he come down here and he he was on earth and he and he preached a sermon about the uh about the seed and the sower and once one was on stony ground one was on this kind of dirt one was on this kind of dirt what happened the seed was planted but the cares of life made that seed die the roots didn't get far enough it didn't get planted deep enough so the birds came by and took it away all these different things that's what that's what he saw happen because he was a caesar seed planter he's been a seed planter since the beginning of time he's the only one that is a seed planter amen for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he justified who he justified them he also glorified so he knows how far you're going to go he knows how far everybody's going to go but yet he didn't he's not going to come ever come that's why i said it's just real simple how the devil works god says you can make it satan says you're worthless you say no no god tells me i'm god's not gonna tell you you're worthless that's right listen i and myself know i'm worthless right but i look what i was chosen in him so if he went to calvary brother chris if he took my stripes if he took my shame if he took every sin i ever committed then where am i the sinless perfect bride of jesus christ the bible says he will present to you without with him without spot or wrinkle a glorious church the bible tells us so let's just start listening to what the bible says and forget what the devil says amen power of god the word predestinate that's not a good word to use the word for knowledge is better now this is a prophet speaking predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination but god not making sitting in order a little hole that you have to go through do you understand that to be a righteous judge he cannot now there's been billions of people on this earth he can't treat them no different or they can stand in the day of judgment and say you treated me differently every person was put on free moral agency even the devil himself and his angels were put on free moral agency because they chose his message over the lords we already covered that but god knew that he predestinated i was thinking yesterday and and sometimes you have to kind of get a little you have to eat a brownie every once in a while terence likes brownies so we've got to eat a brownie every once in a while put you in a different mood but you know what the bible says and even brother brown said god we'll talk about that later god cannot see your sin even as a christian remember he hears your voice through the blood but now i believe he has a legion of angels though that can come down and walk right beside you even through all the things you do because listen what did brother brown say on adoption he said the holy spirit would go back to the father now he's using it as an illustration the holy spirit doesn't leave your body and go over it no it's communicating we'll get to that in a minute listen god put you in flesh to stay right here but he made you a soul first and that soul can go there how do you get a revelation you don't get a revelation in this dimension you get a revelation coming from another dimension when it's from god it's coming from somewhere else so that makes you a spiritual person and a human person wow but we look and see that by foreign knowledge though he knew who would and who wouldn't and he knew how far you would go and even even like i said in adoption he knows how far you could go and he knows how much he can give you you know a lot of times we and we pick on our kids a lot but we were kids too at one time but you know your your parents expect a lot out of you some do good some don't but god expects a lot out of you but he knows the end from the beginning we don't but you know what you got to do as a human being though if you put yourself in christ won't that holy spirit direct you ain't not what it was given for to lead you and guide you into all truth if you'll let that spirit man on the inside listen to what's saying from that other dimension not what's going on here because remember look brother harris had a good quote i like what he said he said these three he said where you're living at is not even so this is not even supposed to be i mean it is yeah we're here but it wasn't supposed to be this way we were supposed to come to adam and eve and just have a glorious time and always be in eden and always be in eternity but that didn't happen right so this is all working under permissive will because none of this everything you see the bible says is temporal or temporary and the body you live in which is a mortal body has to be changed to made it make immortal or it has to go to a grave but that doesn't do away with you you go into another dimension whether it be five or six thank god for a prophet to tell us where they all go thank god for a prophet to tell us that we live in three dimensions and even if you'll look that up i've been looking it up through the week because we think dimensions and it is dimensions that are faster and slower but you know we live in three dimensions aaron what's the scripture that's the height the depth and the breath we live in that dimension dimensions lengths heights breaths i look at depth perception because the wall is back there see we live in this world that has dimensions but with god there's no time there's no dimension he has no limitations you and i have limitations i'll get to in just a minute when we got into time is when god said the day you eat thereof that day you'll die there was no dying before that but when when god said die that puts you in a 24-hour day it puts you now still adam lived 920 years after god said that but he eventually passed away he was mortal you and i are mortal but that thing that was inside of adam it wasn't mortal it was in the spirit realm because remember adam before he was put in the flesh was brother brown said like the holy spirit he just covered all over he was a person but he ruled the whole earth the whole world he ruled it wow don't you think though that that's not what's going to take us right back to where we're going amen take her back to the garden of eden what before the fall not after but before the fall because time brother brown said will blend into eternity because remember time is so strong though look we depend on it we all depend on a time clock and you know what that's why that there they're saying now that they may pass legislation here in the state of georgia to keep the daylight savings time where it is where it changes in march and it won't change anymore because how many times have you it's messed up for about three or four days why because you're a time creature and you get this gain an hour losing our business and your body's just all man you ought to go to the philippines you're 12 hours into the next day that'll mess you up but you know why though because we're creatures of time brother chris was here the other day and he's two or three hours different from us in arizona and he said i don't know why i'm so hungry i said because it's five o'clock in arizona because your body is hooked to that it was five o'clock there you know and it was it was like eight o'clock or something here or something like that and he he's like why am i hungry i said well your body's still back out there in arizona somewhere in time so we're still all creatures of time but when are we going to stop when we come into this when we come under this umbrella of god and and the and the revelation why do we need to be in time and i'm not talking about looking at our time clock make sure we don't preach two hours i'm talking about why do we have to worry about time why do we have to worry about tomorrow why do we have to worry about when we're sitting here today take that thing and blank it out don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow what the bible say tomorrow will take care of itself we all know tomorrow's what day monday and for all of us that work it's one of the worst days why because we've had saturday and sunday well some of y'all have to work on saturday being a postal employee but you have sunday where you just relax a little bit and and you really don't have to feel a lot in time but boy monday morning you're going to work whether you like it or not so let's don't worry about it though right but like i said before and i'll talk about in a minute we we are influenced i don't believe adam the reason i'm saying is i don't believe adam was influenced by time i don't he was i don't think he was influenced by dimensions because he was as far as the earth he was the god of the earth now what does that mean that means he was ruler of the earth but when they did what they did and when god declared the day you eat thereof that day you die and then that day came that locked them into those these first three dimensions to to for them to live in but still remember though what was adam created first spirit being god had to have a connection with the spirit world with adam so he could talk to him what about me and you you were given a soul for what to choose by and when you choose god god doesn't talk to you through your seed tastes phil smelling here god does talk to you through your memory reason conscious effects and imagination but somebody else does too but if you're born again of a spirit of god that soul inside of you came from eternity and came inside of you and you should be able to let that thing out and think eternal thoughts listen to me a revelation is eternal thought glory revelation is not time thought it's an eternal thought it's something eternal that god and you know what brother adam said it's sovereign he'll give it to you but you know what he's not going to he didn't give the revelation of the seven seals to brother neville not knocking brother neville at all wonderful minister wonderful brother but why didn't he give the revelation he knew he couldn't handle it he knew by foreign knowledge before knowledge he could predestinate a gift down in this end time called the seventh church age messenger and he knew that man would be in the eagle anointing and he could go higher and be able to stand i was reading some quotes a few minutes ago or last night sorry where brother branham was talking about he said you just don't know let's talk about sound barrier he's talking about breaking the sound barrier but he's talking about doing that in the prayer line he said cause when that he said when that sound bear breaks he said when i go into another dimension he said i don't know if i'm here or i don't know if i'm there now what about a man that walks and didn't know what place he was in and he was standing there he said you just don't know what i have to go through right i don't i don't think i'd want that gift i'm like brother dale i think i want to thank everybody loves me brother i'm new he felt a knife in his back when they were hugging his neck they were you know sticking the knife in his back because he knew what they were thinking he knew god had let him look look in a faster dimension listen when he was up there in that prayer line there was those demons and nobody could see them by him that come from another dimension they wasn't end time lighting matter they didn't have length breath and depth length breath and depth no they came from another dimension brother brown said i was reading yesterday he said oh sister you've got cancer i said oh sister you've got cancer too so the reason i know it he said that demon is screaming to that demon for help he said i see a black line going across i thought my goodness i'd go crazy if i could see all the demons y'all okay questions and answers number four how can i take a huckleberry i'll leave it alone i already got people upset how can i take a cockapoo and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only thing is what now look here's my thought on this and the process i'm taking while i left that quote in there the kookaburra has been transmitted from a kookaburra from a kookaburra wheat a cocoa bird to a germ called wheat life now that can't happen in these first three dimensions you are a person you are doomed you're dying you're on your way to hell right right but by the transforming power of god through the eternal life that he had he's the only one that can come inside of you burn your old nature out your cuckoo burr nature and put his life in the wheat germ oh you still look like you do but but i hope you manifest different yeah i hope you're not drinking beer smoking cigarettes and running around doing all these things ladies cutting your hair not you see you manifest on the outside what's on the inside you have to because once that life now still you know you you made to the outside world we look like huckleberry still but we should never act like one we should never act like like we used to before then you bury that cuckoo bar it'll produce a grain of wheat because there's a life of wheat put in that kookaburra and the life of the cuckoo bird has been taken out but the nature of the cuckoo bird is still sticky what what's he talking about he's talking about still you've got that spiritual nature of memory reason conscious effects and imagination that will torment you until we take a body change but it less torments you a lot less when you go up that statue of a perfect man because it takes some of them old demons out all right so as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature what is carnal what does carnal mean just for a second human human nature you're going to have a human nature until the day you take change of the day you pass away because you won't come back with that that kind of human nature when you come back into this dimension with that glorified body that's what death does death separates that right the body stays in the earth the soul goes into the sixth dimension but that sixth dimension empties into this dimension picks up that body glorifies it and you don't have that sticky nature no more thank the lord that's what that's why brother brown said why do i fear death all the things all the things sister alicia all the things that bothers us if i could just tomorrow now i don't want nobody wants sister lisa to die or me either one i hope yeah but if we pass away all that's gone it all passes to john and the yangons but for us though you see how god does it though god said brother brown said death they'll take you into that sixth dimension he said and death is only the vehicle that'll take you there because you we're trapped in this thing right here you can't transmigrate my soul we'll cover that a little bit later not today but you can't take my soul and put it in that set of drums you can't take my soul and put it in brother donnie and him into mine because their brother brown covered that in the church age book because there's doctrines that that you can migrate a soul and then even the mormons we were all souls up in heaven literal people according to their doctrine walking around making plans helping the lord helping the devil and then all of a sudden we come down here to fulfill that plan no brother brown said you were nothing just just realize let's realize that but realize when you get the baptism of the holy ghost that takes your mind and turns it back to where it was that you have heavenly thoughts that this thing is not going to be over when you die it's just your beginning and if you're a christian no more no more sorrow pain no no no no no and never will you have to come back here like you were before why would death scare you as a christian right paul says oh death where's your sting grave the only grave the only victory the grave had was he kept him in there for just a little while but you know what paul's waiting paul's waiting because when paul steps back into this dimension with his people that body is going to have to yield to paul and that body is going to connect back with paul and he's going to be a young guy again i've always said before brother dale was talking about this morning we think now this is the way we think if i don't get any further than this that's okay this is the way we think we think that this thing right here is so solid and so it's dying but that soul inside of you i can't explain it but god had a body back before the foundation of the world and it wasn't it had no fall to it but that's what we think we think oh when we move into this spiritual realm that we're a lesser person no this is the most less you'll be that's even this would be the less you'll ever be is right here because that thing inside of you always was eternal it is solid and more solid than death itself because you know what when the apostle paul when he laid his precious neck down on that chopping block and that guy did his job and he whacked that thing right right in the middle of his neck and his head went rolling this way and his body fell over when paul just a few seconds later when he stepped over into that other dimension he did not have to go find his head he didn't have to go no nope he when he stepped over another dimension he thought man got a pain in my neck got a cricket in my neck but it went away just like that so which one was greater the paul that mama and daddy brought are the paul that god met him there on the road to damascus and give him the baptism of the holy ghost there's nothing going to harm us folks nothing can harm a christian you can't be shot your soul can never be shot it can never be broke up into pieces but now listen folks if you don't turn yourself over to god i don't know what your soul gonna look like it's gonna be tormented don't know what that is don't want don't want to know just get born again just get born again it'll take care of every bit of that psalms 135 139 15 says my substance was not hid from me when i was made in secret listen we had to be made between mama and daddy that's what that's talking about we had to be made between mom and daddy and i read you the quote where brother brown said we were born between satan and eve people hates that in the message they do not like that quote but guess what it's true when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuous were fashioned as yet they weren't even on this earth who was he told jeremiah one of them he said i he said i called you before you was in the womb of your mama well now that's a figure of speech he went down there calling for jeremiah no he knew what jeremiah was going to be when jeremiah was born whichever one of them it was he knew that he couldn't say now see even brother brown will talk about jacob and esau jacob have my love he saw how i hated see there he no by foreknowledge he knew what esau would do and he knew what jacob would do so therefore he could by election say jacob have i loved and he saw how i hated pretty simple huh so now let's talk about dimensions just for a few minutes we live in three dimensions which is light time and matter let's read here brother brown this number i think it's quote number four present stage of my ministry if you want to read about all seven dimensions and get ahead of me read present stage in my ministry and he'll tell you about all seven so we've got light time and matter and it's kind of uh we'll get to that in just a second now when we come along we remember we live here in three dimensions and i don't know whether i can name them or not one of them is light the other is matter tommy he's either talking to tommy osborne or tommy hicks i think remember what the third is someone says something he says adam and then somebody says time time right light matter and time and our five senses contact them dimensions our sight contacts light our feelings contact matter and so forth number five face without works is dead look here friends let me give you this illustration i might have done it before what color is that shirt it's white anyone's got sight know that that shirt's white you have five senses of body see taste fill smell in here now none of these senses will declare god there to declare this world when god made man he made him in his image instead of man so what's he saying he made man in spirit image not in five senses not in the sea taste phil smelling here that we know of you understand what i'm saying that we live by now when god made man he made him in his image instead of man's and he put him in five senses to contact his earthly home that's genesis 2 7. not to contact god with those senses don't declare god they declare the earthly home where the man had to contact his earthly home he had to see taste feel smell in here but faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen you do not see it taste it feel it smell it or hear it but you believe it see what i mean so you see taste feel smell and here is what's connected in here but now what makes all that work is what's down inside amen the motivator of you is your inside person your soul that's the motivator that's where all motivation comes from that's where your life comes from that's the real you that's what separates you from an animal you have a soul to decide right and wrong everybody got that but we live in like i said before we live our body is actually in three dimensions body spirit soul like i said before your body is put here to contact this world and to do the things of the world now your spirit realm what's it for your spirit realm is to contact the inside of the inside guy everybody got that but your soul is the real you that's the real person of you that like i said the bible says don't worry about the body you can't make your stature no bigger and he's the bible even tells us is don't worry about who can kill your body don't worry about who can kill your spiritual being he said but you worry about that person that can kill your soul and the only one person that can kill your soul is god almighty amen he said don't worry about if you're born again don't worry about the second death well you say second death your first death is physical right and then if you get born again you have died and resurrected in christ and the second death white throne judgment has no hold on you we bypass that cause that theophany that genesis 1 26 man is what god's looking at and if inside of you that's what god's looking at he can't judge you if you've already been judged what's inside the real you has already been judged i read you the quote last sunday we were in christ at calvary we were in christ at the in the tomb we actually went to hell with him when he went preach to the souls in prison we were inside that theophany so you don't have to go to hell again you already been but your body let me read something right here because man had contact with both worlds heaven and earth he had to be able to communicate with both these worlds that's why god made adam a spiritual being first but now remember he was made a spiritual being that was given eternal life as a grown man but you and i because of what happened in the fall because of the sex act you and i had to come a baby amen we had to come a baby and we had to be given a soul that came from god that was perfect right that's why all babies go to heaven that's why the age of accountability what the age of accountability in this world is what whatever you think 12 13 14 whatever year old you want it to be it's when you know right from wrong it's when you know not to do what you're doing but god though has given you a human body by mom and daddy coming together through the egg and the sperm they give you this physical body listen there's no life in that everybody got that there's zero life in that brother brown said oh that's just wiggling muscles it's just what it's receptors firing it's the firing of your brain and everything being made but there's no life there thank god for a prophet he said the only time there's life is when that baby comes out of the womb and the doctor power and then god gives it life god gives it life but it's not eternal life he gives it a natural life he gives it a soul to make a choice with that's why i thank god for a prophet i was looking at a kid the other day from guilford and it's um tammy harrison and pete harrison we've known him forever they have a well she has a a child a down syndrome child and thank god brother branham i'm like how can god judge that he can't because that's what mom and daddy did he's locked into that but remember his soul doesn't look like that right and brother brown said he even had a special angel that was with him all during their life oh what a god what a god that can do that for somebody and he's got he's got a more chance to go to heaven than me and you sitting here and if you turn the word down you're going to hell but because of what man has done mama and daddy i love what brother branham in one uh i'll try to find it because i want to read that one he's getting a prayer line and they walk up and he's talking about demons and he's talking about we'll talk about next sunday and fourth dimension he talks about a demon and then somebody walks up and he said he said oh he said that's not a demon he said in other words that's just genetically something genetic going on in the body that's just because mom and daddy maybe because i think they do what different chromosomes when you have a down syndrome and they have too many of this one and not enough of this one well it says to me that's life but god gives it a soul anyway but he takes that soul and he says that's not your fault he said that's adam's fault he said but i went to calvary for adam he said i went to calvary for you too he said you don't have a way to make a choice he said so i'm going to give you eternal life now they'll never be bribed but guess what they'll have eternal life duty different ones i'm telling you you look at them you say boy no they got more chance than we do right if we don't get right with god but the three dimensions now listen if you'll think about this just for a second then we'll stop because we're on the three dimensions and i want us to take communion we'll go every time that god has to come down into this dimension a couple things happen now remember before the fall adam and eve brother brown said they just communed like this just every day you know god just walks down to cool today hey adam how are you doing oh dad i'm doing good everything's fine and then when the fall happened it separated that or unplugged that and they had to be caught into this dimension what about pearl adam i think man adam had all this responsibility and adam had all this he could he could just travel like a thought and be over there i just believe that and after the fall though that couldn't happen anymore he was stuck in this dimension the first three dimensions but you look and you see that when man fell time began so you had to start recording time but once that dimension locked in when god broke into this dimension it's always been with noise it's always been with two things thunder and a cloud you think about it you think about what i told you that brother brown said there in the statue of a perfect man he said it you sit there and you you listen and here it comes 2 times 2 is 4. 2 times 2 is 4 2 times 2 is 4. faster and faster and faster what you're doing is coming into this dimension but watch in exodus 20 verse 18. let's go to that one real quick and we'll read that now remember brother branham talks about the sound bear and we'll read it next sunday and i believe that that's what happened when the seals broke god came from eternity to this dimension to give that seven seal book to that prophet for him to give it to us amen and what happened there was thunder and a big old cloud happen oh yeah that came from something supersonic it wasn't man though no exodus 20 verse 18 and all the people saw the thundering and the lightning and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off now when is this this is when moses god was giving moses the ten commandments which at that time would say brother brown calls it the seals thundering and lightning john 12 28 father glorified thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again now jesus heard it but the people around him didn't hurt it hear it they heard thunder the people therefore that stood by and heard it said it thundered others said an angel spoke to him well look how mysterious this is all right let's read one more revelations 10 what happened in revelations 10 i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven closed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head in his face with a sun in his feet pillar of fire and he added his hand a little book open he said his rightful don't land his left foot on earth and cry with a loud voice and when he cried seven thunders uttered their voices any time god comes down when seven thunders uttered their voices i was about to write and heard a voice from heaven saying seal it up then we keep reading in revelations 19 verse 5 in revelation 6 verse 1 i saw when the angel opened one of the seals i heard it was the voice of noise of thunder but it wasn't just a noise because look one of the four beasts saying come and see listen i'm going to leave you with a start right here i don't care what this dimension we're in light time and matter we'll get to that next sunday because we're going to take communion today but when you have an experience with god it ought to shake you it ought to shake you like brother dale said about revelation revelation will change you there's only one thing that will change you because listen even brother brown said brother brown they said brother what is the new birth he said it's the revelation or the thundering voice of jesus christ personally to you because you hear what god said how many times brother brown said remember he was standing up on that rock and the whirlwind and all the people had to run under the bus and run under the cars and he said get down blew the mountain off why didn't it hurt him because god was speaking to him god was talking to him when that thing came down over him they heard nothing but just confusion that's the problem now they just heard confusion they heard what they wanted to hear but they said brother brown what was that he said god was talking to me up on that mountain to get marriage in divorce he said he came and told me and they looked at and they saw this amber light going up and down he didn't talk to them people down there at the gas station he was talking to one man same way with me and you let god speak to you i know we're stuck in this dimension we're stuck we're we're tired we're weary we're warned we're we're still concerned about first one thing in another please people believe that that thing inside of you is more real than you how or how are you gonna how do you get your healing i say god that thing inside of me is not sick it can't get sick this gets sick because mom and daddy brought it but that soul that god give you is eternal never will get sick never will have a problem our problem is his greatest battle ever fought why fight the thing that wants to save you but we do let's stand our feet these three dimensions yes sir they'll hold you right here right but remember if you're born again today you were a spiritual being before you ever before there ever was a foundation of the world you were a part of god you had a legacy you had a peace of god waiting on you and when you got down here you absolutely fulfilled what was there brother brown said if you have eternal life tonight that eternal life and you always was eternal you love the lord amen let's bow our heads just for a minute before we take communion you have the father lord we pray that you'd be with each one as we come to this place we haven't taken communion in a couple months lord and we pray that you just bless us lord give us revelation as we drink this wine and partake of this bread lord we know it's what we do in this dimension but when lord we know that it come from a heavenly dimension where you're sitting now at the right hand of the father lord but you're down here though in spirit form in your bride and as we lift that cup up and as we lift that bread up lord we know that one day one day there was nails put in that body of yours we know that when they lifted you up that all the weight of the world crashed down on your shoulders when they dropped that cross down in that hole and there we were your bride locked into a dimension of body spirit and soul of a man called jesus but lord that wasn't the end that was only the beginning because when you died and you tore your life out of that body you went to hell and preached the souls in prison come back up through paradise and pick those up lord that we're stuck in those dimensions the bosom of abraham lord you emptied it out and took him to glory with you but father you didn't stay there you promised lord a few days before you went to the crucifixion you promised i'll come back i'll send the comforter and i will not be just with you i'll be in you see you couldn't be in the people at the time you were walking on the earth but lord when you come back on the day of pentecost now you can go into any believing heart of the seven billion people on this earth today you could enter into every one of their soul and give them eternal life father i pray that if someone here doesn't have the new birth lord i pray that you would sound a thundering voice in their heart say repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and here we are taking the communion the representation of the blood and representation of the body that was broken for us at calvary and lord we know that one day we'll get to talk to you and you can relay that experience to us firsthand because the nail scars will still be there the nail prints will still be in your feet but they're there for me so that i can come forth in a perfect body and have eternal life and be able to live not have to worry about it in the back of our mind have to worry about slipping up or or messing up or getting a disease or being hungry or no more of that lord we know too much of that as human beings because we live in this carnal nature in the carnal mind but i pray lord just for a minute now that you would release that so we can see that eternal dimension and people your bride can look inside of each other we can look inside of ourself and you can help us see that what we have is you that's brother dale's talking about lord the fullness of the godhead bodily we all have a part we got to play we're part of your body and we must be made manifest we must be made known we will be manifest lord on this earth father i pray that you'd be with us now give us supernatural guidance and supernatural faith father for the rest of this journey we ask in jesus name we pray lord if there's any sick among us we pray lord that you said you sent your word and healed them we pray that they'll dig deep inside brother brown said he said jesus said if he was standing right here tonight he couldn't heal you he was standing right here in a suit of clothes he's already healed you before the foundation of the world so if any of you need healing father we pray that you would touch them lord and give them strength for their journey brother kearn out there in the parking lot lord we pray that you'd be with him and bless him lord and his family keep them away from this this cursed virus lord we pray that you just bless each one now in jesus name we ask amen let's not forget if he wants to take communion i think we can give him communion don't you out there yeah we can give him communion if he wants it you gonna give him okay good okay all right you want to do them i was hoping you said that i gotta find it i never have that thing marked in my bible i do have it mark but i gotta find it bear with me please it's in my old bible and i've got it all marked up and i can't find it in this one but yeah let's give him communion out there and uh if his family is out there they all out there okay all right corinthians i took every one of these out of my bible okay what is it corinthian oh god thank you lord corinthians first corinthians 11 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread you're giving thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this dude is off because you drink it in remembrance of me now for the same manner also he took the cup and he stopped saying this cup is the new testament see he hadn't died yet there was no new testament that's why you we say that and it's and it's true the new testament began on the day of pentecost when this new testament came not the regular blood and the and the the wine and the and the eating of the bread it's when christ came back on the day of pentecost and put his life inside that was a new testament but the testator had to die first he hadn't died yet but he's prophesying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup so i said before let's look look deep inside of ourself don't look at others look at herself but he that eateth and drinketh unworthily either and drinking damnation unto himself not discerning now what's the lord's body we are okay what's the lord's body us for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we should not be condemned with the world if you our condemnation you've passed from death into life you're not condemned with the world cannot will not ever be if you're born again why because he took your condemnation at calvary that's what he's fixing to do right here is what he's telling him they didn't understand it at the time but boy when paul instituted this in corinthians i believe they understood i know paul did that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger led to meat at home that you come not together into condemnation what were they doing they were sitting down and eating a regular meal and getting drunk the prophet said at this communion table but this is not it's a solemn time because a lot of them down here it says that many are weak and sickly among you many sleep you make sure that you can take this communion amen and the rest will i set an order when i come let's take a moment of silence praying one for the other thank you for all things jesus name we ask amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it definitely father we thank you lord for this bread that's been prepared by holy hands it's not just been bought at a grocery store that anybody and everybody's touched but lord has been made according to your bible so now i pray that as we take this communion that we'll understand lord that your body was laid stripes and it was driven holes in it and there was a crown of thorns on your head lord you look terrible but lord to the christian it's the most beautiful thing that ever happened on earth father we pray that you'll just be with us now and let this be a sanctification to our body in jesus name amen you know his legs wasn't broke we know that because the bible said he wouldn't be but he was a broken man when he was on calvary he cried father why is thou forsaken me in other words where's that anointing i had before where's that where's that peace but he said nevertheless not my will but i will be done he did exactly what he was told to do we need to yield ourselves to the same thing do what he said do i used to stand back there a lot of times when i was a young kid but why in the world these people of course being a kid not being a christian i thought what's that going to do for me according to what you wanted to do it's according to what you wanted to do the heavenly father we pray for this wine lord it's been made with holy hands and now i pray lord that as we partake of this as it lord ferments and gets better and better with age father we know that your bible your word lord it gets better and better as time goes on and father we're looking at the time that we can get into eternity father where we can drink this with you there lord in that wedding supper lord we pray that you just sanctify the people bless us now as we take this communion in jesus name amen amen just take that for tell everybody these are disposable the ones they're drinking out of are disposable so there won't be any cross-contamination you got bread okay be careful god bless you boy i'm glad he's here man that makes me feel good but i knew you know what some will stay home when their cat's sick but some will come here when their kids are dying asked ryan and gabby about that how many of you would do that but you know what kid didn't die kids back there in the back playing so it's what you say to this mountain be moved and cast into the sea what you say what you have in your heart but just think about these things that we've been talking about it's like with brother dale talking about the what you are you're the sinless bride of jesus christ and he and that was part of the plan see we're not out of the plan being out of the plan is everything else everything else is out of the plan of god except god inside of you that was his whole plan now sure he's got part of the plan where he's going to have a foolish virgin he's got part of a plan where he's going to have people that are given eternal life because of of their condition that they're born with or the different things like or different things like that down syndrome they're going to be given eternal life he's got a place for them that's part of his grace and part of his plan it's part of his plan of the people that are going to be given eternal life for being good to you don't know a thing about god i don't want to chance that though for john i know too much we know too much we got too much going on we can't plead there was an ignorance offering in the bible for people that were ignorant that didn't know the customs of the land but that ignorance offering wasn't for the priest they died if they did something wrong it wasn't it was an ignorance offering for somebody the stranger that come in and maybe defile something that didn't really understand and we know that being being young christians we make mistakes but now as we grow older paul said the things i do i would not and all that but he said one time he said when i was a child i spake as a child he said but when i became an adult he said i put away my childish things they some things that we should not have to deal with sure we like to drink milk but i don't think mama's my mama but i don't think she let me sit in her lap now a little too big for that and she'd be telling me grow out boy i mean that's what ain't that the way it is with god grow up child come on get off my knee you're growing get up do something praise god for yourself amen we serve a gracious god that we can even do this and pray for each other just remember what i said we love you with the love of the lord we just i just want it to be done i'm a stickler for doing things right and trying to get things done i know i don't do it all the time neither does any of y'all but we try and we're held to a different position when we got a position so just remember that amen god bless you take communion that's good let them go ahead go ahead and take them like we're not going to do foot washing i'll be glad when we get back to foot washing too man get all these ordinances back but god bless you we love you let's just take a second and let them get these up and like i said thank god for everything you do to do though there there's um there's an old saying that that um 20 of the people do 80 of the work but that's okay that's all right because we need everybody right we need everybody to come to church do their due diligence but what's more important folks is to pray before you get here pray for a service that we can that we can break out i'm just waiting any man for brother john to take off down that aisle when he starts singing those songs and and i told him i said i'm like brother dale i may come out that side door and follow you a little bit but right and we know that's not everything but but there's an atmosphere that that you bring and it's hard to fight it if it don't get left at that door right back there hey man okay all right you want two okay brother donnie's gonna get two prayer cloths while they're finishing up right there will put the brother on you just put him on him and how many you need one well i'm gonna give you two yes yes ma'am and you know where they go see that's something that we that's something right there look at what we can do that has nothing to do with the cloth has nothing to do with anything but god the faith that we have that god's now here with us he's not somewhere else he's right here with us he don't have to travel to get here and those prayer cloths wherever they go that anointing sure the oil is a symbol but us praying over them we we set them right here the reason we put them here folks and we got used to have a big bag of them i think we've used a lot of them but that's because what goes over this pulpit we believe is the truth we believe if you come and sing a song if you come brother john and all the different ones coming and and sing that you're anointing all this right here we don't have to literally pray for these i believe they're already anointed we've got oh here's some right here we haven't cut them up yet but with every preacher all the songs everything is done right here this anointed that cloth glory and like brother they'll say he can't wash it off brother danny how long have you had yours 16 years you need to you need to come up here and redo it i didn't think so hey it's as old as them twins right there isn't it almost the ones we give you before but brother danny had him all under his watch and he had him stuck everywhere when he was in the hospital and look at him now he's alive and well he didn't look very well he didn't look very good 14 15 years ago trust me i was there a lot of us were there during that ordeal but you know what the angel lord was there he could have hit his head and killed himself right that cement block went far from his head he fell over how many feet it was off the chicken house moved him over brother ray just a little bit just a little nudge he let him go through some things he lets you go through some things we're not all perfect we might get a broke arm we might get a broke leg but you know what god may want to talk to us god may want to see how many people go to brother danny's house and help him see what i mean god's a god that you have to watch everything that goes on because it's not just one thing old brother danny fell and broke no there was a lot of testimony there was a lot of help that came in there was a lot of prayers that went out what if you didn't have nothing to pray for julie what would you pray for yeah right no but you got a lot to pray for right every night before i go to bed one more four-week close you see that thing right there when i go to bed that thing falls down my arm and i reach and i touch it and i start with sister jill fleeman that has these and she's still battling you know the cancer and all the things all the way down the line and i start until i fall asleep calling people's names do you do that he said what good does it do how do you know it doesn't do any good i do because you're breaking the airwaves you're you're you're getting the attention of god brother brown said god loves for you to quote his word to him i said lord by your stripes right here i am healed i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord let's bow our hands dear lord thank you for the day that you give us you give us a wonderful time lord he give us a really nice building to be in lord you give us comfort you give us all good jobs lord you give us the baptism of the holy ghost and our soul what more could we want lord but we do want more of you we want more of the different things of revelation and gifts and of wisdom and faith and even speaking in tongues and interpreting and and prophesying and all these different things lord as it works in the body of christ we appreciate lord a place to come to now father i pray that as we exit the building that you'll sanctify us lord for this journey that we have to go home then we have to go out into the world and go to work but lord you said you'd never leave us or forsake us you'd be right there with us and lord many times we don't think that but when we go through a situation we see that you are always there you were right there with us the whole time leading and guiding us into all truth lord be with the ones that are sick be a brother current lord lift him up be with the family lord that they won't get any any of the virus lord and all the ones that are around lord we pray that you just touch each one of us forgive us of our sins and may the blessings fall upon each one of us until we come back winning night or not brother aaron for the preaching of the word lord different things lord we
