========================================

amen good morning good morning praise the Lord amen thankful again to be in his house of worship we're going to read from Romans 8 amen 1 through 17 let's pray heavenly father again this morning we are thankful Lord for the privilege and strength that you have given us Lord to come together to worship father we pray that all things that's not concerning your word Lord be cast from our minds at this time Lord that you would just lead us and bless us God give us strength to walk forth and hold fast to your word Lord let us recognize though that which is true Lord and that which is false Lord and hold to your word Lord let us have love and understanding one for another all those that don't understand you Lord we pray that you will bring your knowledge unto their hearts and Minds Lord and we thank you for this hour in this day and the words that we read Lord just let them find a place of rest in our hearts in Jesus Christ name we pray amen Romans 8 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it is weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the rightous of the LA might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be Carly minded is death but to be mind is life and peace because the carnal mind is enity against God for it is not subject unto the law of God neither indeed can be so cannot God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and Christ in you the body is of but the is but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you there we are not to theh to live the for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many spirit of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB Our Father Spirit itself bear Witness with our we are the children of God if children thens of God and joins with Christ if so be that we suffer with him then we can glorify together amen God bless you be seated amen amen and amen I want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Joel 2 and I had Joel 3 but we'll go over to Jeremiah 3 Brother Anderson gets it I had it Joel 2 and Joel 3 but we'll go Joel 2 and then go to Joel to Jeremiah 3 okay man good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we had a good time yesterday at the fellowship meeting and everything had a good good crowd there and uh pray that uh you know we get to Fellowship together cuz that's the only time we ever get to see each other that's during that period of time and really enjoy it man remember the announcements now the uh let's see the Bible study will be coming up the first Saturday in December remember our Christmas time will be uh there in the December the 14th and then remember the watch Night Service and and uh on on the 31st and brother Boran be preaching for it so remember these announcements I know we have other announcements and also you know you can get ready for your Christmas time of who's supposed to do this over here and who's supposed to do that over there and every what yall do and all the doing it but let's go to Joel 2 and Jeremiah 3 all right Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you have given us an opportunity first to believe you then an opportunity to serve you and then an opportunity to know and realize that you're God and you change not by knowing about you then we can come to a realization in our hearts of a loving savior of God that changes not and that you Lord are Desiring to Fellowship among your people so we just ask you to come and bind all enemies and powers of that would be against thy word that we may be able to speak what you'd have to to be said and Lord bless us and guide us we love you and we thank you Father and just have your way in each one of our hearts and lives in Jesus name amen sure we'll go to Joel 223 be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former r rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the C the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the pmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of your the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall not be ashamed all right let's uh we can keep on going but we know what it is that he promised the outpouring of the spirit all right and we know that took place back under then it took place you know of the time but just to save time reading let's go over to Jeremiah now and remember what we read up here in verse 23 of Joel it talks about the former and the latter rign and then the promise of restoration all right the promise of restoration see but then he spoke of a for and L all right then the promise of restoration but now look what he says in Jeremiah 3:3 therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no latter rain and thou Hast a forehead thou refuses to be ashamed you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we spoke last weekend on a Revival and I hope you followed and listened to what I had to say about the things that I believe in all and uh I I'm I've always been one to try to take everything the prophet says not just uh get a a certain thing you know and get a part and say well he said this well I I love to keep on reading to find other things that are said and in doing that then we can put it together and it comes out to be a beautiful picture but you can take anything you want to uh of the prophet of any point or thought whatever or the Bible you know and and you can make it say anything you want to and you can say well I said what the Bible said well that's true but you know how the prophet said that one day he said the Bible says Judas went and hung hisself then he took another scripture and says you go do likewise so then you can say well I said what the Bible said all right but see to put it together and bring it together in a complete form to where that you can take everything the prophet said about that subject and uh be able to uh come out with a conclusion because if you can't then you don't know what you're talking about you said well I I said what the Bible said or I said what the prophet said well that's wonderful that's good but that's the pro what did he say that's just being able to read amen all right you say but but I'll just stick with what this right here well you know the reason you stick with that right there is because what you've been previously taught right huh what you've been previously taught whether you like it or not or want to admit it is still in your brain right you cannot erase it you were taught of Trinity you know all right and you were taught nobody can understand well then by doing that then that shuts off your mind to the point of trying to receive all right it sets you in a position that you won't listen and uh you know cuz you say well I I I just stay with what the prophet said I just be simple well be simple and be stupid that's very little between the two you know and then you put it together and be simply stupid that really does get to be a bad problem problem but the I've always tried to get you to look at everything to take all that the prophet had said about the topic you know and bring it together and even though it may sound uh contrary but it will come together if you'll give it time and then even like you'd say well the prophet talked the white horse rider was the was the Holy Ghost then he changed later you can't put those two no you can't put those those two together because that was one thing that could not be uh remember until the seals broke nobody in the world was responsible for knowing about that white horse rider even though Clarence Lin before then said the white horse rider was the Antichrist that's before brother branham's time but he was not a prophet see he couldn't bring it and like I said until the seals broke you can't say the prophet was wrong right he was just lack of understanding right but then when he come to the point of of you know it being presented then he accepted what was presented and that's all I've ever tried to get all of us to do is accept what's presented go home think about it study it over and see all right and that way we can understand all right see we went through you know and showed how that the prophet said the Revival is over he said America rejected the gospel in 56 and he said that's thus sayith the Lord will we believe that the worldwide sweeping Revival is over there'll never be another worldwide sweeping Revival he said they're looking at the two witnesses and the things to Israel remember we brought that out looking at the two witnesses and the the closing heavens and the doing things you know but remember now even that Revival will not be a worldwide sweeping Revival it'll only be a Revival to Israel amen it won't be for anybody else all right but see then we're not looking for a great sweeping Revival and see we could say well I I said what the prophet said Revival's over well what about where the Prophet said the bride hasn't had a Revival yet youen remember that was out of the seal book said she hadn't had a Revival yet said it take those seven unknown Thunders to wake her up well well I us don't see how that can fit together with this all I know but see it's over for the world y he said you say the Revival's over he said it's not over he said let's go forward you remember that let's go forward he said it's not over see but the worldwide sweeping Revival is over yeah all right but why is it that we can't have a Revival of our own like he said and see you say well that was worldwide sweeping Revival that he was speaking of back in the 56 was over with cuz he said then you know he said I predict that they'll reject the gospel and he said and they did but there in 56 he said a Revival amongst the elect right amen of Revival amongst the elect amen see then the Revival that he was speaking of when he was speaking in the seal book that said the bride hadn't had a Revival yet that's not going to be for the world Amen that's going to be only for the elect then brother Dale are you looking for a Revival no I've been I've been in one ever since I've been in this message but see you're looking for a Revival to sweep out and hospitals emptied and and all of this that and the other you say well we got where the Prophet said there won't be no empty in hospital no but he didn't say you couldn't empty a room now come on he didn't say you could go you're not to go in there and pray for people I'm not going to hospital and pray for nobody cuz might empty the hospital now don't be that exalted that won't work out too good you know all right but you see we look at something and we set in our mind what we think and then when somebody's contrary to that we just cut it off you we just cut off their thoughts and don't listen but you see that's where that I've always said said if you don't agree with me come and give me something contrary to what I've said that's right well if you don't agree with me you're Duty bound to come and tell me that you don't agree with me or shed up you remember at the weddings when you asked the thing if it's anybody here got any reason that this wedding shouldn't go on Speak now or whatever forever hold your peace well had a brother say something about that one time to me about a wedding and I said uh hold it brother you was the best man and I said you said there's something wrong with that yeah I said well you was the best man why didn't you raise your hand I said in other words shut up I don't want to hear it again and I don't because see that's what you're supposed to be but yet that don't work he everybody got to y y we'll get to that in a little while in the message and see but do you understand what I'm getting at I believe there is to be and is now going on the greatest Revival of all revivals now all the great things that had happened all the great movement of God and the sick healed and the the dead raised and the things like that I believe the greatest Revival is now in effect to the elect amen right right but you know what that can be somebody sitting right there on the Pew right beside of you can be in a Revival and you're sitting there dead as a doornail that's right amen right amen and not know what in the world's going on that's why I said when I came into the message and saw what the prophet was saying I've been in a Revival ever since because I love for him to speak something to me you know and I I love to keep things dangling kind of in front of you I asked question yesterday I said they had a cup of water there I said is that water on the inside or is that water on the outside I said which one is it when it's on the inside we saw them poured in there well they got optical illusions I guess is the word for you ever seen those things that a spet sitting out in midair and not hooked up to nothing and water running out of it ever seen one of those I mean you're going to get up there and get a hold of it to find out what's going on because to look at it it looks like it it's just sitting there in mid iron water's coming out of nowhere you never seen one of them optical illusions we'll get to that this afternoon all but now what I want to cover today is one thought I hope I've made myself clear I'm looking for a Revival to the Bride of Jesus Christ the greatest Revival do you mean it's going to end up with less than what we start you know I mean is it going end up to be less than what you start with you mean everything in the Bible would speak of the end time yeah do you agree with that that's right you mean all that's been down through there all the great things that's happened and yet we're just well I'm just waiting on bus pull up you one of these days something going to happen get well what about you amen brother they ain't waiting on a bus I'm waiting on an airplane we'll get you a jet and go to work but listen be serious this is life or death we're not coming to church I hope you understand I thought everything back there pointed to this I thought everything was waiting on you and I of course we don't believe that so now you see and when we get to it in a minute you'll see what I'm talking about you'll see that spirit that takes us away from the revealed word is what's killing us and binding the holy spirit cuz come on if that statement ain't right I want somebody get up show me I'll just quit then you get up come on show me I'm wrong I'll quit I'll never preach another sermon you got my word on that if you can show me that everything before us all of that back there all the whole Bible is not pointing at this time for you and I to make a change of the body walk over this Earth in a Rapture and you tell me this is not the greatest day well I don't see nothing going on what's that got to do with it what does that got to do with it yeah but if we had it we'd have I stood up last night and testified at the fellowship meeting of two Miracle babies and about a young couple that would come to church with their baby laying in intensive care on life support but yet they came to church you know what God touched the child but nothing's going on you'll never see all of those things like that but why can't we believe if everything back there is not pointing at us then we better turn around and get to pointing back you know this is the greatest day that's ever been the end of all things the Bible said has come upon us right amen yeah but but look what's fixing happen look what what if he live back there in the Dark Ages and they took you out and cut your belly open and fed you to the Hogs took the babies and cut them out of the mothers and throw them to the Hogs all in the name of religion brother I don't think that's going to happen again what if it does you're I don't think it's going to happen ain't going to stop it but the faith to believe God's word and be prepared to where we can understand what's going on Amen you look at the people of this message and if you think it a it ain't been right about what I've said all these years because this ain't the first time I spoke about the things we're going to talk about how the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years you realize if that's statement is correct then it really was not free on the day of Pentecost the way God wanted it to be free or else your Prophet was wrong it's because you've always had Satan involved in the whole situation see but I wrote this like this say why are part not people getting a Revival or experiencing one they are not taught to expect one right come on might quiet on that ain't it they're not taught to expect one or what are they taught to expect some oh I want a Revival I want a Revival well what do you mean well I want to see the power of God come down in the building and US shouting speaking tongues and screaming Glory Hallelujah and shout all over the place that's what most people think of Revival is I thought that a Revival was to revive what you already had I didn't know it was to shout Glory Hallelujah that's the effects of it right that's the effects of it you're wanting to go back to some kind of a form when it's all pointed to here amen right and this is the day and the hour that God has looked forward to to bring his bride to a place that they could believe his word and stand on his word irregardless of what anything takes place now I just don't see nothing going on yeah but listen why are you not expecting a Revival why can't you say you're experiencing one you realize revive means to row over and each time you get a revelation you're being revived right when the Lord revealed something to you you're getting revived Lord showed me something Wednesday night when Wade was preaching Lord willing I'll try to get to it this afternoon and uh you know talk about it a little bit you see I enjoy when the Lord speaks to me abely amen you know and you know sometimes it's very rare and you know sometimes I have to go quite a while waiting for any speak to me again you know but what about you what are you expecting you know what now let's make the statement and then I'll get off of that part of you're going to get what you expect you're going to get what you expect right because you're expecting it well God can't do anything other than what you expect him he cannot override our free moral agency that's right amen don't worry about it it's not going to sweep the world you know my you know I have said this there was certain brother used to come around cuz he wrote a lot of letters and and i' say God please don't do nothing while that man's here cuz if he do then it's going to fill this church up and we're going to have to build on he said well you're you're I know what I agree with you I'm a funny person but you know I've come to realize we could have right here in Lula the dead raised every day and it wouldn't add one person to this building if it did it'd be denominational people that didn't know anything about the word that come in to see the effects don't worry about it but listen are you expecting a Revival or are you experiencing a Revival want to get that point there's a lot of difference in the two you're expecting something means you do not have in your possession or you would not be expecting it right but if you say I'm experiencing it well now what's been our thought for 6 months or more now positive attitude talking about that only the people in the Bible that ever amounted to anything was people that God spoke to and gave an experience or something right well why not start expecting something to take place you know what it might surprise you take place you know well we sat around this home drum and not expecting nothing well then that's what we're going to get right a man on the radio one time years ago and he was talking about his Blessing plan that he said you got to take it and you know put it to work and uh his great plan that he was talking about all right now he's made a statement he said nothing from nothing leaves nothing right and you know what I believe that yeah you know nothing from nothing leaves nothing we're getting a PL plop around up here so somebody have to chase it down they're working on it all right now but listen why is the Revival not taking effect right let's just read a few things and to see what your Prophet had to say about why and that's why we read the scripture that he promised a for and latter rign Joel amen right he gave the the doings and the you know the outpouring of the spirit the different things he talked of those things and you let's try to swap in a battery or do something or whatever we got something wrong with this system but now as I said Joel promised these things all right but then Jeremiah said it is going to be withholding right why I remember years ago I spoke on that and uh sister brother Harris's little daughter she couldn't understand so she wanted to know what was a horse forehead you know then I had to explain that you know what was a horse forehead and uh it all come out I hope to the right understanding but you know but that's what it says in in uh Jeremiah says because thou Hast a horse forehead that's the reason you don't have to stay there get turned on that's the reason that there's he's withholding the rain y right now we went through in the message last week that brother browner's message is the former Reign amen right amen I've been listening to it about three times this week on the spoken word Original Seed where he says you know talks about the former and latter rain and and things and you know and remember he said you people say you've had a latter rain he said nonsense he said you hadn't had the former reain yet and then in the the doing he says this Prophet will preach for the from the beginning to the former Reign he calls it right well because that's his message his message was a teaching rain right the latter rain is a holy spirit to Quicken that all right so now you got to have the former so we've had that we've had the prophet's message we're not looking for another Prophet to come to to bring us a message or tell us where this message is wrong yeah you know and it should have been said this way or should that you know like they're doing today but to know and to see that the former Reign is planted by the prophet now I believe the five-fold ministry has to plant that rain amen I believe that that's why we stay with his message amen improve things by what he says cuz that's former Reign see what I'm saying to you God quickened to me this and that would be a latter rain in my understanding but when my words are being brought to you I can only speak of in a former rain form because it's a sewing rain and even Jesus when he was here on Earth as we'll get two more this evening he told Nicodemus he said you must be born again now that was a former Reign that the man could in no way understand but the disciple on the day of Pentecost saw what Jesus was talking about because they had a latter rain and it quickened the things he had said and even taught them things to come the Bible said all right now so we're not looking for a former Reign to come you know a teaching Reign by somebody else now some of you blanked out so I'll say it again the prophet's message is a former Reign amen I believe that the fivefold ministry must sow that rain because it's left up to them that's what your Prophet said and the Bible says the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints all right now but she has no message to bring other than what he brought right right all right amen but see then God brother brandom says only the spoken words written of see said God will be the latter rain to come and take the bride in the rapture amen all right so now let's talk about this what's what's the problem that horse forehead that's your understanding that's your intelligence so we're going to be dealing with this intelligence that we think is so great and we'll we'll try to get to it so go ahead with number one on hearing receiving and acting and look what the prophet had to say it's 196 uh 607 therefore the church needs a good cleansing what we need today is some oldfashioned Revival some sweeping revivals some power of the lord we need men and women who's willing to sell out to everything in this world to burn every bridge behind them we need to take the world today we ministers like the Norwegians used to take a country and what he says they done amen when they went in by ship they hit the shore and set the ship a fire and burned it behind them and nowhere to go he said now that's the way we need to be you said but brother Dale asked back there when when he didn't look for Revival now I I want you to tell me and show me where the Prophet ever said he wasn't looking for a Revival I've done went through that in two Services last Sunday to those on the internet if you ain't got enough gumption to go back and listen to it don't call me about quotes they're there because I tried my best to express express it the best way I could right about a Revival but look what he says he said we ought to be like that burn the ship behind us but now U let me say this without being too sarcastic if you can straighten brother brandom out and do the things the way the people are today you evidently didn't burn your ship yeah right right you evidently didn't burn your ship cuz you got back on the boat you got off of and you pull back out in the ocean right so you didn't burn it behind you right I don't have anything left over just in case this don't work and I don't have a Swedish Swedish bank account in case the money goes wrong and I got a little hold out you know I got all of my ducks in this row and it's going and it's been going ever since I've been in it so I ain't worried about where it's going all right look at the next one now think about we're talking about we need a Revival he says to sell out everything in the world but yet I admit you and me me me we're more worldly today than we've ever been we got more worldism than we've ever had it might not be wrong with a lot of worldism because that's the world but when we put worldism that's right ahead of the word of God like I said about Ryan and Gabby they came to church when their baby was intensive care on life support and I told him last night as honest as I could tell you if that had been me I probably wouldn't have come and I'd say it right here 99% that leaves Ryan and Gabby out 98% that leaves them out I'd say 98% of the people in this building would not have done what they done if you don't like that forget it I give them honor and Glory because they believe God spoke to them well if you believe God spoke to you where you ought to go to church where he spoke to you from okay look what he says off the message God's provided Place 1965 all right you can say well this is back in the old days there look what he he says that's the way it is today people want to hold on to their Petty ideas they want to hold on to their Creeds they want to hold on to it then talking about a Revival in our day how can we have a Revival when it's all messed up the way it is watered gasoline and everything else all kind of detergents and all these modernistic thing so what's he saying like I said most people are not looking for Revival so you might as well just cut the tape off and forget it till the service is afternoon that's fine you know but if you got any thought in your mind of thinking about a Revival to the elect something going on now in the elect to get ready to walk out of here that's it and if you're not thinking that way then you're not elect so it's okay all right look what he says about a in a deceived Church by the world while Samson was bound and we can't have a Revival listen to our loyal brother Billy grah Revival in our day listen to our to all listen at Old Robert screaming Revival in our day listen at the rest of them Revival in our day how can we have a Revival when we're bound no brother I'm loosed we've bound the holy spirit with our organizations and traditions and we can't have a holy ghost Revival we're not in the organizations bless God I've got out of there a long time I'm ago like brother Mo used to say he said you got your coat and hat and moved houses you know what he meant same old coat and hat hanging on the corner of the next hat a house you know you didn't do no good you just got your coat and hat and left see church I'm serious because this is life and death to me right but what are you waiting on I want somebody to tell me give me some hope yeah I don't have no hope but what I read I have no problem with listening to your ideas of what you think is going to take place as long as it's in the word but why is it everybody who comes along some young man come up got a little move a little spiritual go about everybody runs to him I don't one they die down they come back waiting on another young guy to come along oh we really got it this time okay but we don't have no organizations brother Dale we don't we don't have no Traditions he said that we we bound the holy spirit with our organization and traditions he said we can't have a holy ghost Revival now if the Holy Ghost is bound How can there be a Revival when I always understood it was the Holy Ghost that brought the Revival the Holy Ghost would get on somebody's heart and they'd rub the seats and praying for everybody in there in a Revival strike that's my understanding is if I missed that I'm sorry look what he says on the next one I think it's a deceived Church paragraph 79 so Revival in our day how can we have it when the regular Revival Giver is bound by the world now how can you have it God won't come in where the world is you can just depend on that he said you associate with the world then it it it's all of it when you let the world creep in you go to acting like the world then you're finished but when you cut loose ever fatter from the world and come to God God will use you until you go to flirting again you know that a lot of you don't believe in going to Fellowship means you think that's whirly but were with you yesterday in Walmart or a ball game or sitting watching One or deer hunting okay but you think it's worldly to associate with people that don't agree with you but you let them call you to come and preach and you'll be the first one there you'll open the door for them I've said that and I won't back up but you see that's where we think that out there is keeping us from having a Revival uh-uh as a matter of fact brother Brown said that's going to put the pressure on you and you know what he said he said the church always done better under persecution so you know what they're going to be our help yeah right Y what you see Church you go to flirting again here's the only hope that I have this morning to wind up my message is this while Samson was bound a new Shak of her grow out see that's our only hope in Lula Georgia amen is that God has given us a Time what do you think we've been around here 40 something years since the prophet's gone who do you think that was Far irregardless if you want to believe brother rand's coming back and preaching you've still been sitting waiting on something to happen right the rest of the people making fun of the people that believe it that way well I don't believe in that old junk about that I I don't believe in that old return Ministry what are you doing well just don't see nothing going on but we we'll go to church today if it don't rain Grandma don't feel good I'll probably go down by her afternoon and visit her at the nursing home afternoon okay that means you could come in the morning uh okay the only hope you and I have is that God has given us time that a little lock of hairs grow back on Samson's head that the bride has come to reality of thinking hey something's got to take place cuz if it don't you and I are dying and going by the grave that amen look what he says on the Feast of the trumpets that's 1964 719 he's talking about you know the ridings of the white horse rider I mean the four Riders and the things coming through like in the seal there is another group being made ready after a while Revelations 19 the next time the church is heard she comes also and up on exactly horses not excuse me not upon exactly horses the Bible said he was on a white horse and the host of heaven was following him upon white horses that's right while this group down here has got 2,000 years bound what's now bound at the river Euphrates and that's them Spirits remember and you remember what happened in those Spirits y those Spirits were bound and loosed on ikan and Hitler and them to drive the Jews to the the Homeland in the 30s the 40s and threw that away all right I say still driving them to the Homeland but that's just the point but he said to be loose 20 years later upon the bride well if you want to go to 48 then somewhere in 88 it got loosed again whatever you want to start it should have at least started something now loosed upon the bride to drive her to the Homeland right okay look what he says and has Bound for 2,000 years also that church is bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under modum back there and under the church ages it's been bound not at the river Euphrates but at the door of Creeds and dogmas at the the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of man-made systems now if you'll take that from 60 4 and 2,000 years would put you back past even the day of Pentecost because remember as quick as the Holy Ghost was loosed on the day of Pentecost the Antichrist was Loos also right amen right so the holy ghost has never been able to work in the church freely like he wants to why because people started taking their own ideas what about people in the days of Paul saying the resurrection has done P that's what they talk you know where they got that from Paul misinterpreted what he said because he talking about the resurrection to be an out Resurrection and the resurrection of the new birth was inside of us right amen and they put it to a physical thing right but look what he goes to say see this is one the things I love most people read this and they get all the home drums and they're down in down and out oh persecution persecution don't bother me whatsoever no I don't want to be killed I don't want this to happen or that to happen but I know one thing for sure if it's true that the church does better under persecution bring on the persecution look but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible said amen not talking about what a man said talking about what we say it's what the Bible said and those two meet again meet one another on the Battleground Lucifer and Michael again like the beginning they've been bound to for 2,000 years almost almost 2,000 years Michael and Lucifer will fight when the Jews come into being right but why can't you see what's going on now Michael is Christ and I thought Christ was here fighting a battle now I would like for you to read to for and show me where brother Brandon brought any army down from any country together around Jerusalem come on you've been taught all your life all these armies are coming from India China Russia and all this gather around and it will take place but I'd like for you to read to foreal and show me where the Prophet says that you know what he says is coming he said Protestants and Catholics because what is Russia China India Protestants and Catholics well those countries over don't even have they've got the same carnal mind that come out of the garden which is organization or Catholicism my brother Ram never talked about firing guns and big old things you know tanks running he talked about a battle that if you'll read it you can see they were in that battle the greatest battle ever fought is right here in your human brain but we want to look at the all we want brother Dale brother gave me a book one time I want you to put down everything brother Brown said on 77 I never wrote down the time cuz he didn't care what was going to do this out or the other all he one was all the quotes well tell me brother Dale is Russia coming down this way is China coming this way is it coming down way why don't you just get a map and look the Bible says when Jerusalem has come passed about on all sides and you know what we own one side probably 3/4 of it is in cirle by us are our buddies right satellite countries cuz where is the Antichrist supposed to come from here right he says she's to be loosed look what he says on canor there paor Locus k now 1959 paragraph 113 you put a rag around a sh line you know you try to close off try to strain out all the bugs and that's what's the reason today we can't have Revival in our day it's too much man-made Dogma the lifeline won't won't wash through an old g r a g that rag I guess he's saying it'll stap the life will drop right back down to the ground that's the reason our revivals fail our revivals failed because that we're not getting the lifeline straightened out now what's he talking about there the lifeline water coming out of a cyan and you put a rag around it to filter out all of the bugs and you just get more bugs cuz we used to we filtered the bugs out right and we thought we were safe drinking the water we pushed it back and you know kind of remind me on movie I saw one time about an old old drunk when he comes up on a liquor steel where they got the mice going and it's kind of working and he didn't uh he didn't get him something straining he just moved the dead bugs the snakes the frogs the the the possums and everything back and he just he didn't give a hoot about a bug see we thought we filtered the bugs then we found out there was more than just those little there were minor organisms you know every what it was and kill us well I don't see how they died cuz we we filter that water yeah you filtered some peanuts down in Georgia not too long though right look at the next one this is from the third seal and now if the church churches would forget their Creeds and forget their dogmas and just take the Bible plead the promise that would become effective to him you want a Revival you've got to want it you've got to want it you got to First find out it's for you right right all right he said God will bring it did we read that the Holy Ghost may have been bound but you know if you read that whole message you'll find out that the Holy Ghost is be loosed according to Malachi 4 the Holy Ghost is to be loosed according to the prophet's message but how many of us are interested enough to read and listen to T do things what about it you say well he said the Revival's over he did back in 55 56 isn't going through there but look what he says in 1955 on a hidden life in Christ go ahead it's number eight R it up for you Brethren the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost that brought them results in will bring the same results to every believer tonight that's willing to concentrate their life to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of the Lord Jesus the Same Holy Ghost but you go out to people like I told you I said in Colorado years ago and two brothers was talking about and they said well we don't understand how come brother Brown said the holy same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost was in the people and I tried to explain that to them and they just blowed me one went this way and one went that way you know they didn't even listen cuz you see they already had it figured out one of them thought it hadn't come yet the other one thought you already had it that's that was what they were doing see you can't talk to people about a Revival why because it's all over and if it does come brother so and so will tell us when it's coming right man came to brother Mo's house one day and brother Mo mentioned something that he and I had been preaching on and the brother looked at him said where'd y'all get that from and brother Mo said it's what the prophet taught he said no where'd y'all get it from said it just come out up in North Carolina up here under a few weeks ago I said it came out a lot of years ago in a prophet's message y'all are just now getting catching on to it of course I had one brother call me he said I want to come down and preach this new thing that's going on up here I said I don't heard about it don't want it boy he didn't like that I told him don't hurt it don't want it yeah but listen if we'll do that if ever believer not just willing to consecrate their life to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of the Lord Jesus not a hard thing to do you know what look what he said it'll do he said it'll break down Traditions it'll change men's Hearts it'll melt you into one person in Christ Jesus s an old F and S Revival across this country he said that's what it would do right well where's the people going to do this what we need today we need an oldfashioned God sent Heaven bought Holy Ghost brought Revival not just a little bitty shaking up or a little emotional worker but an oldfashioned dying out self-c concentrating Hallelujah backwood SK skin sky blue sin killing religion amen it won't white wash you it'll wash you white the devil will white wash everything that he can but God washes white and that's what we need today is an oldfashioned God sent Revival that'll just break down the hearts of the people and bring all of these denominations into one great big unified group of the glory of God now we know that's not going to happen but let me get down to just a little Point here that brother Rand made a statement one time I forgot to bring it he said when a move becomes among the bright a sweep he calls it he said them denominations will gather together boy bless God one of these days them denominations going to gather together and when they do we're going out of here that wouldn't what the prophet said he said when the move becomes among the bride the denominations will come together you want them to come together get a good old handshake and happiness around here when some of you ain't shook hands with the people around here in six months right right I ain't talking about just one okay I'm talking about the biggest portion of you right what about it let's get down to Lula for just a minute go ahead with number nine let's get this one couple of little quotes we'll quit look what he says on adoption there is where the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed watch what he says it is your misbehavior of unconfessed Sins Of You believers the unbeliever is not going to stop anything he'll try to hinder it but it's Believers that you got the problems with right can cause this church to bitterly fail but here's where people doing it and at the day of judgment you'll be responsible for every bit of it bless God I'm straight I'm right you said' wait a minute brother well that's the truth Lula Georgia what do you realize if he's right there that unconfessed sins is a problem now a lot of you know a whole lot more what's going on in this church than I do because you like to run your mouth and you like to listen to what everybody else says instead of saying don't talk to me talk to your pastor now you ain't going to say that cuz you got that gossip and spirit on you get upset with me too old to play games that's right but you see the reason I don't know what's going on here is because I don't go around oh what's going on what's going what's going on what's going on yeah yeah brother dick going eat we in the morning don't find out what's going on then the next morning brother Mark and next day brother and next I'd rather sit down in the woods I'd rather sit down in the woods on a deer stand and pray for you not thank God say God show me what's wrong hey he don't have to show me what's wrong I'm looking at it right he don't have to show me who's doing what because you know what now find out you're doing it I'll pray for you I'll pray for are you well you're a funny fell I'd go right straight to that person or them people or them no when that happens and I'll call you in my office remember one statement I make you come in my office whether it be him or him or her my kids or my wife and you're called in my office you don't have nothing to say what do you mean brother Dale when I call you in there you don't have nothing to say I'm going to tell you yeah but you don't understand my case not expl I'll say shut up I told you when you come in here you don't have nothing to say you say no that's not right you told me that ain't right if I cry and pray for you and lay before God and and cry and pray and he he does speak to me he ain't waiting to dilly dally with anybody do you understand but you see our problem is what said one person now all all it takes is one thing I would like for you to explain now we got Wade Dean Aaron where's Bob and Lise now I want the camera to turn around on me when I sit down is there any way to do it I may have to get a little further back but what if I sit down and you're preaching and I go h or either do you know that one person can walk in this building with the wrong attitude and affect everybody in this building that's right you don't think like that why is it that we're supposed to pray and things before services and you come in here with a bad attitude well brother D what that got to do with Revival Revival's got to start here what's in the other churches out there we can't control revival can only start here when we come in here with one attitude one mind and one Accord amen you realize brothers sisters anything we grip about a baby right I move up front where I don't hear them babies crying my hinder my spirit that baby crying don't hear to me as much as you sitting there with a lock down attitude I'd like for you preachers to answer that one thing to me right that's right that if I sat there with my arms folded Y and didn't say Amen when the service is over you'd want to talk to me and want to know what I differed with you about am right amen I walk outside and don't shake your hand why why didn't he shake my hand he walked right by me are you kidding it what's hindering Lula is Lula do you realize you come in here with a lock down attitude and you will control every person is sitting around you amen you ever notice me I'm always saying amen sometimes I've amened what I didn't think was right when it was finished but when it started the amen was right I've got accused of that a few times I said you didn't hear the first part first part was right you see a child crying did brother brandom say a child running through the church between Services would hinder the next service to come no brother Dale I don't think God's that way then you don't believe brother Brown's a prophet okay cuz that's what he said you come in here with a sarus attitude sat down grappy then the people around you are going to have that attitude and all you got to do like I said all I got to do sit on the front row and you preaching and I go everybody the building what's wrong with brother Dale he didn't agree with that you see Church we're not getting by he said at the day of judgment you'll answer for that amen I'm not going to judgment bless God well then you're going to have to repent to this church do you understand you're going to have to come up here and bent to this church for your actions and reactions are you're going to be held accountable for them no is that right am I mean all you got to do is one thing and people around you know there's something wrong and they don't have to know there's something wrong but reason Reon is most people's got that same Spirit a lot of you sit next to each other because you like the spirit you sit next to I watch you move when things starts and how many times have I told you if you got a problem you're supposed to come to me but Brother D I don't I don't I don't start nothing but if somebody comes and says something to you you're supposed to say let's go to the pastor are shut up of course you're not going to do it but you're going to answer at judgment amen well brother Dale I've seen you bad attitudes and I'm always saying to me you forgive me you ain't never heard me say this I'd like to play you some tape sometimes you ain't never heard me say I forgive you cuz I know what's happening right then and I say I forgive you because I believe if I didn't say it other problems would take place see we're not playing games church this is not just going to church and being good paying her tithe and somebody's going to walk off this Earth and these old bodies going to be changed what but you know it's only when the bride has a Revival and you tell me you're not going to have a Revival and I tell you you're not going for you ain't going to be in the chain of the body I said it 30 something years ago the biggest portion of the people would die and go by the grave because they would not be able to do that I've said that to you for all of those years that's right but let's don't get a pitch for it and start throwing it back okay right you know and say Lord get rid of my part like I said let goddamn kids crying I can't listen I can't preach with that attitude because I can put up with the kids crying more than I absolutely we listen to tape the other day and there was a kid cried on the tape for 30 minutes brother R never said a word he just kept right on preaching and he was at jaff if I ain't mistaken but he just kept right on preaching yeah just remember you come in here with the wrong attitude you get your feelings hurt you're trying to lock down that's why I love to look at individuals and look you in the eye because I'm trying to save your soul amen amen that's right because you'll get upset because I do something around here that you don't like and I'm trying to save people's Souls you don't never have the point of saying well I don't understand what brother Dale is doing but I've seen him before and seen it come out right a Revival is not a great shouting Glory Hallelujah it's the opening go of God's word when he's revealing it to you and I he's Reviving us right how is the statue of a perfect man Built Well I need patience I'll just I'll just have it I'll just I'll just get me some patience no he's going to reveal the word to you and bring patience going to reveal the word to you and bring knowledge and Temperance and that's right godliness by the opening of the word now you tell me that ain't right I want to know where you're getting it from because for 50 years that's all I've seen and all I've tried to get you to see rocking close to 50 years to try to get you and me to see Christ and get away from our baby Petty feelings brother around said in Christ The Mystery of God reveal what he said Church it won't leave you that way we've got hund close to 120 people on record in this church he said he won't leave you that way he said he'll send somebody in sit down among you shoot them with poison said they'll go through the church I've got that one if you want to read it he said when it happens cling together it didn't say agree with them and you know oh yeah that's right yeah but that's that gossiping I still say you're on the phone five minutes or more you're gossiping because you're going to get around to it no we're taking prayer requests why can't God move in Lula do you realize what that would be at a judgment we remember we're not going to the white Throne judgment no no no no no the bride don't go to that but there's a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad your Prophet said that and the scripture says it all right you realize that that judgment you're going to stand there and answer for every little little attitudes and all them times you listen to people gossip I can't HP it they just started talking there's a little old word that says shut up my wife likes that when where you know there's a little old word that says no you know that's the hardest word for me to use is no cuz I'm a Doty old granddaddy you said well brother Dale you've heard feelings this morning let let me say it the best I can say it you can't hurt the bride's feelings you can stir them a little make them think but you can't hurt their feelings so if you got your feelings hurts you're just not right is that enough that plain enough let's stand but just remember my statement if you sin before come on M this if you sin before the church you come before the church to answer that and why wouldn't you want right I don't understand that I've been under two Pastors in this message I'm thinking that's right if I may count more but brother Mike was one and brother MO and while I was assistant to them and I wasn't a pastor or ministering of it brother mik I was a deacon but people would come out and ask me questions about the message and I would refuse to answer them because their Pastor was supposed to answer that question one day he was standing there and he said go ahead and answer I said I will then brother Mo was Pastor here for five or six years I can lay it on the line here before God and say I never done one thing against him to try to hinder him I always wanted to help him I wanted to back him up well because I believed he was trying to bring the truth you never heard me say even with a couple of brothers that we had problems with over the years I still made nothing derogatory about them because I loved them Brother D I just I just can't be that way well maybe you need to pray that's all I got to say what we got brother 596 596 anybody have a need the Al's open night I I begin to cry and my mind just fails to know exactly why I can't explain with tongue or pin the spirit is GR gring deep within it must be God here in my soul I feel the PO I feel the PO I hear the call

deep within it must be God lord Jesus just be with our buddy Lord and all of this when it takes place everything all right ibody else I know his Fe is moving me give my all to me and what about itol I to hear the word and each and something to say to the church now that uh the pastor has talked about having wrong attitude and I didn't want to leave the service cuz I'd justify you know the way he says if you wait another day you justify yourself and I didn't want to do that I've had uh wrong attitude in the past and I want the whole church to forgive me because I was going through some things and I've heard people's feelings you know and uh even with the baby people want to hold her I don't let some hold her because of different uh I grew up in Africa I grew up differently and you know I don't believe in some things like kissing the mouth or so I try to stay away from that and but I don't I don't mean to hurt people's feelings and uh I've been accused of not talking to Young sisters I talk to the older women I'm not trying to ignore the young sisters I'd like to be friends with everybody and just different way of growing up different genetic makeup so I'm a little bit different but I don't want to hinder anybody or have the wrong attitude or I've had problems in the past and you know some people knew body but I do know God has delivered me from a lot of things amen that I cuz I used to see people come testify and I used to wonder now what can I say God has done for me he's done other things but you know a deliverance and now I'm able to talk to a sister I really used to have a problem with but I have no Pro I woke up one day and I have no problem with it and I really know God delivered me out of that I didn't work out anything but we've been praying about it brother Dale knows about the issue he prayed for me my husband prays for me a lot and it just disappeared and I'm very grateful for that so I'd rather answer for things here than over there right with an opportunity so thank you for that Ma we just ask you to reach down touch her see having problems we commit it to you Lord and believe you that by your stripes he in Jesus name anybody brother wants to say a word you all know me I have had a bad attitude a lot of times in years past I have been listening to Brother Sam and what he's had to say I ask you as a church to forgive me for the things that I've been short Stampy whatever about but I would also like to testify I just spent two weeks on the best vacation I'll ever have because God moved from me while I was gone amen my attitude has changed I know it I can't explain it I don't I wouldn't try I just know I'm Different amen and I appreciate God for it and I hope the rest of you can see it and will forgive me for all the past amen amen and amen anybody else would have a need father we thank you for this day and we just commit it into your hands now believe in you Lord that you you showed us the word to bring and I know that I get in the wrong way trying to bring it I'm sorry I can easily say to the the congregation Lord and I'm sorry for saying something that would be offensive but then when you say it it's up to them to decide Lord cuz I can apologize but you don't have to we just ask you to help us all bring the right attitude among all of us Lord from the pastor to the back of the door Lord we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you dismiss
