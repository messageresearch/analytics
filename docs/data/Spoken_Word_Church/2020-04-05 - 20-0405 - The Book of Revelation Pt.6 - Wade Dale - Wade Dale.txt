========================================

all right good to be here good to be here this morning wanna make sure we pick up make sure that we are up and running Lord bless you good to be here in the house we're good to have all the room is just full of empty chairs so we've got everybody here today that didn't come with us so we're still doing the 10 people and still doing the distant singing washing our hands so you just hang in there we're going to make it through this so they want to do some hard times in the church seems all the different church and dozens of Church ages and they got killed for what they believe we I got them that parts yet so world k at the moment we might have to do little I've been out walking mile two miles every day and every day in every Indian we kind of eat a little bit better so make out all then a whole lot out there but we're gonna start here I think we got down to like verse 4 and but we'll start again to the angel of the church in Sardis that's the third evening church age is the one two three four number five church age it was a time of of Martin Luther when he was protesting the Catholic Church so did people in this era our time our church age was persecuted for over a thousand years by the Catholic Church and you read foxes Book of Martyrs that's when all that happened Columbus time that things be Martin Luther's coming at the end of that age and he's bringing his message to the start easy in church but this is what God has to say to that church into the angel of the church in Sardis right because you got to remember that angel was Martin Luther so God was directing whatever he was saying he was saying through Martin Luther going through the angel of church in Sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars melech Seven Fishes art seven starts with Roman Church ages I know thy works that thou has a name that they'll live us than our dead remember we talked about that last Sunday where the first three Church ages there wasn't a such thing as the father mode of baptism only in this Catholic age of the age of Columba did they develop they I mean the Catholic Church and then everybody accepted it that the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism was the correct method we know it's not you have a name that I'll live it than our dead and it wasn't even a name it was titles to a name but God winked at her Ignis because the book was not open the book that working under a closed book being watchful and strengthen the things which remain in other words Martin Luther was getting a remnant that was coming out of the Catholic Age Martin Luther was getting that group of people they still had a Catholic reign for a thousand years or more so the Catholicism in the brain or in the psyche of the people was that it was right so here comes Martin Luther who is a Protestant who protested that's where you get Protestant from protested the Catholic Church said be watchful and strengthen the things which remain so when Martin Luther comes on the scene God reveals to him that to just show them by faith not by penance not I know Binion not by the sign of the Cross of the Hail Mary for praying the dead Saints but it was what believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die so that we're still in that church he's coming out at Turf days they were still persecuting the Christian where I have not found thy works perfect before God now this is the church so they will do work they were not in a perfect sense but in God's eyes that were perfect for their time their makeup that they were perfect for their time because the just shall live by faith that's what put them in the body of Christ with you and now that's not all included it's part of it but at this point in time I have not found thy works perfect before God remember therefore how thou has received and heard and hold fast and repent in other words you're fixing to hear a message from this man called Martin Luther and he's going to tell you some things that you haven't heard previously because the previous thousand years was we're on the Catholic Church decided and holiness independence and now he's fixing to tell you something from God to repent from that hold fast to it and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee telling the people look turn back to God get away from what you're doing he's not talking about coming this is not the coming to the Lord okay coming to the Lord was not the third Church at our fourth birthday all right but he's telling me to bring a message yeah okay I'm coming to bring a message and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments no where's Hilda this was the Dark Ages but look that was bride in that dark gate they weren't all it sure they would get a little bit but they would still bright they kept their garments white and that had lived through this turbulent time some had to give their life during that time but there was some that made it through and they show what was being white for they are worthy he's overcome saying shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels in other words it was such a horrible time they were coming out of God's promising the people if you'll live right to your messenger live correct by the Word of God through your messenger then you're gonna be robed in white I'll not forget you he's not gonna forget that church agent because he's not gonna forget this look for the church oh you just because they had all the Catholicism and all those things God still had his little bride in there somewhere all the way through all right mm-hmm and I will confess him confess his name before my father before example even happen here lady hear what the Spirit says to the churches so we know for sure that Martin Luther was the turkic messenger it was from 80 1520 to 1750 a couple of hundred years and there was a lot of times in there that that did look really good but now that was the beginning of restoration now remember you got to remember this it was Reformation because he was reforming the people not doing away with all the doctrines of the Catholic Church he was accepting Father Son Holy Ghost baptism he even accepted the Eucharist for a little while and he had a lot of things he brought out of the Catholic Church that he used in even in Lutheranism now you see the difference that you see it's emblems of the Catholic Church because the ritual they did he brought some of them with it so that means they weren't perfect they weren't all doing the right thing but they were doing one the time they were doing it in their break up that the Martin Luther was a mighty powerful trkage messenger a lot of things went on in its life that would you go through but we're going to continue on through I read a church a book and read Martin Luther he see what what God meant did Martin Luther because he protested the Catholic Church are that's why you see again that's where the Protestant message began you see that there was a group over here that protested the Catholic Church and they didn't sometimes they basically protested them but a lot of times even in close to like in the 1700 you'll read back in history where the King of England team James and different Kings a freaking King James Version about okay though Kings were some of them were totally Catholic but then you had King James and the different Kings Henry the eighth and all those different ones in history that you read in the history books because I remember we were at a Constantine back in in these we read when Constantine came and made all the took all the riches that he had he made churches out of them they took out this one they put it in this one you read that history because the history reads that Constantine was a good guy but we know brother Brown says he he used it for his own political gain and he he put church and state together like they have a Jezebel did and that didn't work out very well so but he was one of their Crusades they put crosses on their shirt and they went to kill him if you didn't believe in the Catholic Church on this end coming up you didn't believe in the new part coming to got the Turk then you were killed so now you were coming out of that age of the physical killing in turn now a spiritual killing which you got you you got your white horse here red horse and black horse in these two church pages because the blackness was not the physical killing this was Ben kill him down here going into the safe but then the spiritual killing is where it all came from because well hapless Catholic state tattling Protestants yeah sure God used him for a time but God you can see in a minute God moved on to this next trkage in this next church a messenger and a lot of people said oh we're Lutheran's we're standing right here well then God moved away from them they became part of the Protestant move but they were reformers not restorations but it was a start of restoration because remember the corn of wheat went the ground died he'd come up stay dead they put in the ground a new you can see it from here a bit but when you come back to Martin Luther it's like the seed went back in the ground it stayed there for a thousand years research a book stayed there for a long time but all of a sudden the sunlight started shining on a new message of protest to protest the Catholic Church that all these things were wrong but now remember to you got to remember the reason it's not total restoration my brother around come to restore is that when Martin Luther come out he brought the father son Holy Ghost baptism with him he brought the Trinitarian doctrine with him he brought different things that the Catholic Church came up with gun didn't cut didn't come up with these things the Catholic Church did but getting there was some things that started a restoration because he should know when I'm praying did thinks anymore we don't have to flaunt ourselves and walk down the street with our knees to try to do penance he left some of those things and came out why the Bible says come out over my people when he came out but what he does he brought some living same way we're gonna talk about John Wesley he was part of restoration but he was under Reformation because he left a little bit of what Luther had Lutheran ISM not look there's pure message but he left some of that and said ok the just shall live by faith but you can't stand the pub and drink beer and smoke a pipe and talk about God anymore God has brought us to something different okay because you got to remember to in this sardian church age it's when ten Bell Wycliffe and all them started putting the model together so they were able and now with a big thing with King James and all the different teens the different Kings is like we can't understand they go to Mass and look at your history they're so good on the History Channel there's something you can see the underlying religious part being a being a spiritual person you can see how God's working even through those Kings to get the Catholic Church over here and the Protestant Church over here to protest because because one of the Kings I think it was King Henry he come down he says I'm the new leader of the church the Pope can be the leader of the Roman Catholic Church I'm gonna be the leader of the Church of England so buddy that started another little beauty war in itself but they were so strong they prevailed and you see them making their own Protestant churches to be against because that's what protest what do you do when you protest you're saying that ain't right and we've got a voice and we're saying that's not right so we're protesting that all right so that's where the Protestants came from but it wasn't a fool like I said restoration because Martin Luther brought some of the bags with it and then John Wesley brought the same pretty much father son Holy Ghost Trinitarian all the different little dolphins but when we get over into our church age we're gonna say a full restoration of pushing all that back and we take the floor word of God which is just like it was in the first church age that's why you've got the Alpha and Omega bride being the same basically the same brighter plus we're plus they need to take the river right now resurrection interactor we take the resurrection in the Raptor we're plus our plus is the headstone nobody got there now our plus is the seals the the no eternal health because see that still came up cat litter little girl Leslie might have done away with purgatory but they still believe they wouldn't become Pam all right so but if when you see that you see the property god company says no that's that's got to stay back down but Luther brought someone with him Wesley brought someone with him even Pentecost brought son with them but when we see the full restoration of the word coming in the end time that's why God had to send a prophet at wedding he wasn't going to send a property just to say what William branham's the Prophet we're going when he believes him and he's right here balance is wrong you could say that but that's not really the way to approach it approach it in a way that look read revelations 3 there's something wrong with every Church 8 and the last one is totally wrong he's going to spew out his mouth God is standing on the outside of church when you get back in and he didn't say that here he's saying okay I got a little bit against you but I'm gonna take a group of you out I love you but there's something I don't love about you it's like we're gonna say the same thing here but you got to hear what the Spirit says to the churches so Martin Luther had a baptism the Holy Ghost many many many many many many people dr. baptism the Holy Ghost under Luther's message of their just shall live by faith come out of that kind of a church showed God that his words race and show God yeah well he show it down here that we look at that to just show that my faith with Martin Luther it was the seed word for the time because that Steve had went the ground and died couldn't abide alone it had to come back up we wanted to come back up into to shoot Robert explains as many hundreds of time it comes up into two shoes now hmm we're fixing to plant stuff out here now in the spring you put the seed in the ground it warms it bursts and get the moisture it bursts open and it puts up what I don't care if you plant corn beans or whatever most of the time it's either one little shoot or two some dense two suits come up just like this now that's very important couldn't you say oh I got corn I got corn less harvested you will not get anything but two greens you three green shoots of grits you that's all you're gonna get go ahead but there's life and that the life of the seed is in that but it's been it's been held inside the to shoot so then when Martin Luther's message Martha's message never died there's no message ever died the messenger died one way but parts of his message moved on through John Wesley and then there's the stock comes up look you gotta help you know this was okay but it can be kind of tossed in the wind and you can almost trampled it over you see how window but now when that's shooting the middle of a piece of corn it's a big old stock right it comes out of that middle in a big stock and it leaves these down here how the life was in this but all of a sudden now the life is going to come out into that stop these are gonna die put them in the ground die looters people looters in the ground they die physically died not spiritually dying they physically died had to like them but that life has moved into the what the Church of Philadelphia which is a little more closer you just got to see this in chemistry all you see is cells and photosynthesis going on in and and green and but inside there somewhere is the light that's going to make that little PCC you just can't find them that you you take when I planted my of course they were already big but some way or somebody had to put one one little seed had to go in that ground if first opened up may have tree about this tall I've planted it and now I get hundreds of out without put one seed that was in one Apple that came off of another dream so where's the life the life in the sea the life goes up through the trunk the life goes up through the trunk but then what happens when the corn eat now we harvest corn to eat when it's wet we say wet because you put it for corn on the column things like that but now in Illinois we're hunting that they have to wait a little the market content in that seed is the less coming that is less than 10% so it's almost dry because what will happen with their process is then that don't the stock dies first you see it just as brown they said man they get this but you see the old farmer not an old farmer but he goes out there and he pulls the ear back pull the grain out and does some little process to it to see how much moisture contents in it if there's too much moisture content if they harvest it and put it in a grain bin you're gonna have out probably you have a corn sweet if everybody knows what that is on the south you're gonna have a wildlife in liquor why because it ferments we don't want that permit he doesn't want to firm it so he wants that tank completely look like it's dead but let me tell you something though there's life in that scene whether we look at it like now when we look like man word there's a hammer there's life in that seat where and then he'll put it in the bin and guess what if this is a heirloom seed if it's not that GMO junk they're doing there but if it's an heirloom seed you can take that seed that came off of that corn cob take that seed next year he'll put hundreds of them in the ground and make thousands of corn that's the way God does with spiritual multiplication in the same way does with when he started with one seed Martin Luther comes up shoot that was very important don't do away with it you can't go from seed to seed there's a process you guys have what green shoots then you gotta have a stop and then the life comes out of that God moved on to the Philadelphia Church they put through the good great powerful church not just to just shall live by faith but let's get Saints and petition right let's not smoke drink cuz let's live a clean life john wesley says clean life but that's still he still brought a lot of that old stuff with it right because he wasn't Steve but inside there is every cornstalk this every time sorry every courtier is inside that stock actually Elkhorn stop that record one day in Institute so the line has to move through all that to get to you and I which is the seed grain it's got to go back to seed again but where is the original seed but black brother Brown said you potentially help an arrow Corning come if you cut that down you'll never have another elysee say that's what he wants to do one cut it down no doctors boomed over and sit all I meant stop I'm gonna make John Wesley come out of this I'm gonna fill him with the Holy Ghost and I'm gonna run that life all the way up that stop I'm gonna make some more leaves up here because they put they got to be able to praise the Lord and get sunlight into that make it green photosynthesis to put it down into the ground roots and all the other things working together that's why you can't cut any of these turf changes out and you you hear people sometimes will be little Church ages no there's the life of God started when he went McGrath when Christ went in the ground died he said if it stays there buys along but if it what it becomes 4 which is resurrecting this is Palm Sunday resurrection next week he resurrected so that what so that you and I steve's could be planted in the ground of our hard enough the ground of our Monday because the spoken word is original see what's inside is what works this outside guy is too it's just like all humanity but the inside guys what makes a difference but there's the seed word back again inside of you so that when brother they'll preach it brother Brown preaches any minister preaches and you receive you're receiving the pure seed word you're not you know receiving stops anymore you might mean you first start cuz everybody's journey just like we were coming up a broom if you'll notice in Athens time when he first started in this journey under justification has a tight he made a lot of mistakes he didn't love because he what he didn't know he knew that God give him a promise and he knew that that promise would come to pass but he didn't know how God didn't tell him at first he saw you at ninety nine years old are going to have a baby with samurai which now will be Sarah he didn't give him all that information he didn't need that you don't need all this information to begin with you just need to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved a man and when you do when you receive the life of God he comes out with two suits coming out now not born again but the tissues is part of it which is justification like we said in church a ceased he let me sit thou hast a few names which have not defiled the garment remember that for that one time receiving hurt and hold fast and repent what's the first thing you do when you in justification you repent of your sin okay that's that's justification under Martin Luther justification the to shoot you don't really you know see you don't really see the stop yet or you don't really Steve that ear of corn yet but you got it right there the life that's gonna make it is right here so the wife is gonna make you from Abraham's a neighbor is already there if you're truly justified and you didn't justify yourself that's what we've been talking about stairs but if you continue on then we come in to to the angel of the church in Philadelphia right now now think about it let's remember let me get this point straight Martin Luther had the same new birth you got not different now the word he had to work with was different than what you have today because under justification to just show them my faith that's what God for that time said I'm gonna click on that it's like I said about this you know you look at brother's back I want to see if those that right now well that's all Luther could see but now that doesn't do away with the whole world but all I see right now is going back him God said ham I'm happy with that because you see me dot you see me but then Wesley God just open up one more he's not that's for people sitting in here would even Sam when he hit this right here Martin Luther did but when you come to John Wesley he opened his eyes a little bit more for the word because if they would read it number one because that was a problem with a lot of the kings had with the Catholic Church I missed that point a minute ago what happened was is they were glad they didn't speak Latin so they go to these masses and they were doing all dirty and pardon the expression but you know saying this in a foreign language and the King for life what did you say what I mean God is supposed to talk to us you know the Catholic Church is what we're yeah we're God's represented you do what we say and some of the Kings were like nah man my common people thank God for some of them I know it's rotten but someone really good thank God for some of the Kings that said no I don't want people to be able to read this Bible that you say you've got in this Latin ballgame you sitting there you yelling yawn yawn yawn yawn the whole service hey listen nobody thought anything of it yeah you were just doing doing works but then King James and all the different King says no I will select a print that will see the Catholic Church then said no that's when that thing separated when the Catholic Church says no this is the way it is remember even the Catholic told brother Brown city well God's give us the church we can rewrite the Bible or do whatever we wanted to programs like no you know that's not what she's going to be doing so anyway so that's where the separation is let's read this we just sent in we'll build from because the angel the Church of Philadelphia write these things says he that is holy he that is true sees coming more from justification and sanctification coal with its truth he the have two keys of day that you can open no man shutteth and shutteth no man open we're getting ready to see a missionary age regards going to send them a seed out all over the world I know that works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou that's a little strength what a little strength what the stock now lives little strength and has kept my word and have not denied my name we'll stop right there let's go play god bless you well at your service in just a minute [Music] [Applause]
