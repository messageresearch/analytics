========================================

he's gonna throw you guys off a little bit like that you get it like I say it's like a puzzle relations 28 elation 3 to 28 to 29 so there are neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free view there is male or female for you all one in Christ Jesus and if you're being Christ then you're Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise also the price of the Bride of Christ is male and female like Adam and Eve was there he had a male and the female had the same mom in the same DNA so see there's a cry in the land for a kingdom and there's a cry of a child was growing up without a father there was a crier for a woman who's given in age and can't find a man to marry who can't be responsible in every relationship you say there's a cry of churches where women volunteer for everything and men or am ia missing and I'm usually named Douglas he says that men who are here on earth can get their instruction by heaven but flush it out here below let's say in Greek God tells us what to do but we want we want to do what we want to do yeah so this is not our world we've been put place here to see the affairs of a king but a lot of men say oh I'm going to run it the way I want I want to do it [Music] there's not a righteous for male but for a kingdom and there is also right for a kingdom and from Almighty God he said he looked he looked for man but he could not find any the skull is sick you'll 20 to 29 to 30 CQ Vicki or what 22 9:30 he said the people of the land have used a present and exercise robbery and have that's the pool in idiot they have oppress the stranger wrongfully he said and I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I could not find any confine none let's go to a wall Genesis 6:5 tree said and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord that he had made a man on earth and grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the thoughts are there for a repenting me that I have made them but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord let's go so there must be a difference between that just being a male and being a man so God is having trouble fun and being a fine and a kingdom man school Isaiah 3 verse 12 as for my people children and their oppressors and women rule over them or more people which they left the cause of being to hurt and destroy it the way other paths this is something about the on the children are chaos and women not and the women have to rule you know we're living in and destructive culture now there must be a difference between a male and a female in the book of Genesis when God created Adam he was created in a perfect environment by the perfect by a perfect being let's go to Genesis 1 now when God first starts creating his he's God he says and God said let there be light and God God God said that to be this but God said let there be there but when you starts dealing with man and chapter 2 he goes from the God that create anything up you know creates anything out nothing you like to say but in chapter 2 when it started the over the man he's the Lord God you know and percent and said the Lord God formed man of the dust line out of the ground made the Lord the Lord God 15 in the Lord God took the man 18 and the Lord God said if she died admit that man should be alone I will make him a helper and out of the ground the Lord God the Lord God is capital L Ord to be it to be a kingdom man you have to have all that all the virtues of a statute of a perfect man and the kingdom kingdom means ruled of kingship he says you are not a kingdom man unless God is telling you what to do said the problem we have is that independence of man then who don't like to be told what to do we don't want our kids telling us what to do and even if our wives tell us before to do we don't go for it sometimes even if God tells you what to do what to do you don't do it unless you like what God is telling you so the kingdom of God the eternal servant or kingly rule of God manifested and accepted by man on earth and the hope for the future the central theme of Jesus teaching the phrase does not occur in the hope destined but that idea is present in thy kingdom my kingdom we have we had three drivers at waterworks and one driver retired so they kind of saw the driver and they kept looking for him all the time be it was always in the truck token on his horn and stuff like that they could never get him to do anything so the ball says told him one time we don't have any work for you if you want to sweep the warehouse or whatever you can and stay here so he called Brown and the big boss who said does that there's a manager of the warehouse has the authority to tell us to shoot the warehouse guess what he didn't last very long so he didn't want the job so they sent him to do other stuff and they fired because he was always making excuses I don't want to do this you don't want the job as Colonel John 18 33 the third Center then Pilate entered into the judgment Hall again and called jesus said unto Him or thou the King of the Jews jesus answered him saying thus the this think of thyself or did others tell it to be a mean Pilate answer mi-joo domination the chief priests said deliver thee unto me what has God done jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world in my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate therefore said unto him although King then jesus answered they say that I am a king to this end was I born and for this cause came unto the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is the truth pass it and the message perfection brother - brother Graham said Christ verse 4 shadow also and Melchizedek in the priesthood in the ninth chapter net 7 not in the seventh chapter of Hebrews are the Melchizedek Abraham also foreshadow all that they're all the good thing just a shadow and how that Melchizedek in the seventh chapter read on him here would you read it for a moment for this melts says that a king of Salem priest the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the start of the kings and blessing amen Abraham Lord his cousin had back slate you see that real truth period of Christ he said I hope you get it no matter how far he backs lived when he was in trouble here come Abraham to him with an army the aliens around it about through the bellies of Sodom that come down and took Sodom and his King and it took him there and had to take lot with him my neighbor hummus on cold blood relation brothers children he looked down and saw that the enemy had taken his blood relation he form an army of his own servants went after him that represented Christ when he was the Church of the Living God had been called away in error of the devil the Foreign Legion angel came to the earth to pursue the devil overtook him are they to be a scarer the enemy and will how we love him for that overtook the enemy and he slew the enemy and robbed him of everything he had cast him aside and what was the first thing that they think they did Abraham returning back without his wife his children and all the procession trampling walking back to the old home grounds again he met Melchizedek melchester there was a king of Salem Salem and Jerusalem is Jerusalem when the Jews went into Jerusalem they called Jerusalem Salem which means the city at peace he was the king listen let us read to Abraham gave a tenth part of olive first being interpret the king of righteousness who was that this king they met him come back with a triumphant victory as a church is today from cavalry after that the king of Salem witches came at peace with our father without mother without the Senate they were neither beginning days nor end in our life who is this king of Salem the Great King of Jerusalem not the earthly King the heavenly the earthly Jerusalem is a type of the heaven II here come the king of Salem which is the first king of the Rachna the king of peace he didn't have any father didn't have any mother he didn't have the beginning of him there's been a lot of kings and there is a lot of kings but there's something wrong team there's only room for one King and that's Jesus Christ in the message that seven seal brethren said now they said it was a sword of the king but it said the sword King the sword of the king and there's only one King and that is God and he has one sword that is his work and the message that spoken word is the original seed progress that you can only serve God as you do and believe that sermons and god send you can only serve God on earth as God's servant that sent on earth by divine inspiration interpreted the work to you the message world the world falling apart that's the King that should come to his kingdom someday and his kingdom is not being established in their heart of his people here on earth on the kingdom you guys ain't got farm yet mister of a perfect man that's what I was talking about Kingdom and has that of all this especially yes right ten person you know that brother or sister do you wrong yeah go ahead so you need all these you got a patient you know you're gonna have enough what a brother Brent said if you don't have enough I'll be there stitch of a perfect man God willing a chef statue of the man you're affecting himself into that being perfectly worshipped God enough being his Tabernacle God manifesting how we could stay on that till you almost suffocated in here from the heat notice that God is always at all kinds of reflected in himself in a man and demonology brother Graham said man never didn't keep his covenant with God the law was never kept it couldn't keep the law Christ was calm and broke the law himself because Grace had already provided a savior Moses provided a way of escape and in the escape rather and then the people after that they still wanted something to do in the present state of a ministry man is a failure to begin with he's only an agent through which Scott works through and God works his own will but when you see the super-duper people that's always having this and that and the other you better stay away from them see Jesus himself into the death process and all the things relevant I believe that when God calls a man to service if he's a married man as as the help man he calls it one of the 10 because they are two she should have done it [Applause] questions an answer God is not a woman God is a man there's only one really one that is a man a woman is the byproduct from a man man was not made for her for a woman but woman was made for men see if you just open up your spiritual understanding you see man when man first came on earth he was both male and female feminist and masculine before he'd become sexy a feminine spirit the lower spirit is suit oneness Timothy and then there's also muscular man but when he may then put him into a difference in order to reproduce a world he he brought the feminist spirit out of him and put from him and ripped from his side and made him a female the Revelation chapter 5 he said all nature waiting for his master the master is the son of God it was given to serve now God will have his heaven of course but this is given to the man and the Kings man redeemer come to redeem us back to that we lost when the work is finished we we have all these things again what kind of all things we'll have all power we have all eternal life will have eternal health will have eternal youth will have eternal power or just it eternal with a tournament and then we're all waiting for that time to come Tice tight attire I just say searching 10 kids are okay I'm a because I sake not thyroid if they're and we can look to earth the hem and see the son of man rising from his throne to start to work the earth for the rapture of his church and I know that his precious feet won't touch as a sinful earth as that time for as Rebekah wrote the camel and jumped off the Tamil right between the house of Abraham and until she met her bride Oh God and the church will meet our bride in the air it was bright Malin everlasting life he said when you're staying the kingdom stay in the Gospels stay right one one of these days God will call you out and set you aside add up you and his son before the people and give you as something that will shake the nation with it yeah absolutely brother said God doesn't deal with groups a man God deals with individuals because the man has different ideas he's built up different in nature and God has to take that man and mess him around and pull him Iran out of his own self till he gets him in his nature and God deals with that person [Applause] got hidden and reveal in simplicity the president said a man was made to rely completely upon God that's the reason we're like unto lambs a sheep and sheep cannot lead himself he has to have a leader and that Holy Spirit is supposed to lead us so man is made that way and God made all of his works so simply that the simple couldn't understand it and God had made himself simple with a simple in order to understand by the symbol perfect faith I don't forget this one I might be getting close God uses men and men only God doesn't use machinery God doesn't use crew a man who doesn't use organization the do use of individuals always I'm bailing a God he will hello Henry when God first started creating he was a self assistant tell him you know and then like I said in in chapter 2 and it's there's the Lord guy so then the Lord that you breathe you know that scent you he's also your Lord he was alone am the eternal burning and Hamlisch thought he wanted to become material they do then he spoke the word and the world was materialized that's the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation it's nothing wrong is there lying men met materializing so you could be touched whew and in the Millennium that Elohim said in on the throne that's right with all of the subjects around him that he predestinated before the foundation of the world like a man building shining or making chimes and water which bells got to ring different from the other the same material but so much iron so much still so much pressed to make it give the thing that's the way God did it you breathe this one - that one - this one - that one - this one - that want to be God exactly what he wanted the future home he said potentially the kingdom of God is in earth now in the hearse of his Saints is its attributes that he began in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed what's he waiting to retain the earth to see expects tribute on it to fulfill exactly this bridge predestinated plan things that are to be it is a perfect Kingdom so it might be a perfect people come because you have to stand to be married to a perfect Son of God and you might be a perfect price okay you do it through anything else but the perfect world of God which is the waters of separation that washes us away from sin Amen that's right the father Jesus Christ think of it the drinking blood world amen the blood the word of the God bleeding blood to watch the bride and a man yes sir she stands perfect virgin adulterer and she never seen in the first place amen she was strapped into it any question that I comment by the way too unfinished good part of me because he says surely sometimes we read Genesis 5 verse 1 and 2 Genesis 1 and 2 it goes in with the program yet his his father wanted to oh yeah this is the book of the generation of denim the day that God created man and his likeness and God made him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created and Adam lived this book is of the generations of Adam in two generations of Eve I think the duration of generations of me or anybody of the generations of Adam and male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name that alludes to male and female was Adam yeah he was both and then when God separated them the analogy of pulling a rib is just a story he took Eve out of Adam's separated Balaam all right he said we're gonna help man they tell them as long as you don't throw me out here I'm good I thought y'all gonna throw me out okay thank you like I say I'm not for all the way [Music]
