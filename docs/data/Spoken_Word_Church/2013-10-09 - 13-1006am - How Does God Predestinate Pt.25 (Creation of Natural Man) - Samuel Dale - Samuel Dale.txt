Johnny's out today called this morning said she got into bad poison poison ivy and you know she's too old to be doing that that's what I'm laughing about she's too old to be getting into poison ivy but she is she W like that but you know and sister Kathy Gabriel is real sick this morning remember her and we figured we'd have probably more watching on the internet this morning you know from the live Services than we would actually have here but you know the Lord is good to all of us good to see everybody if you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Romans 8 where we've been reading and then we'll go to Genesis 2 Romans 8 Genesis 2 we really had a good time yesterday in the Bible study and you that want to uh hear the services you're welcome to them quick as we can get them made brother Jo and him's not here today so you'll have to wait a little bit about getting those made but just pray for brother Joe and him be traveling back today and brother Bob and them from the meeting so remember them and keep them all in your prayers uh then announcements the last uh Wednesday of this month which will be the 30th will be brother forny will be here preaching for us on that Wednesday uh we got other announcements later of different ones but let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your love unto us we thank you for Calvary we ask you now that you'd just bless each and every one of us with your presence and your understanding Lord that we may walk in the light of your love and to see you made manifest among us here this day we pray that you would forgive our sins most of all and keep us in your love and Lord that we might walk in the light of thy Grace is our desire because we know that you desire to to reveal yourself unto us and that was the purpose of bringing mankind into being to be able to make yourself known and Lord we pray that You' Just Have Your Way Now guide us in Jesus name amen Romans 8 28 8-31 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified in me also glorified what shall we then say to these things what could we say to all of what he's done for us if God be for us who can be against us all right we'll go over to Genesis 2 and begin our thought thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made remember it was 6,000 year I mean six days creating the Earth and then coming up to where that the seventh day would be the rest then on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made see all right and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had caused it to to not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust to the Earth see does to the ground and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living Soul we pick up the next scriptures in on over so you may be seated uh the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been attempting to cover the things of seeing the creation and as we were reading there see the world was created and it was 6 days if you want to call it 6,000 years that's fine because a day is a thousand years thousand years is a day in the Lord so it took God six days to make the Earth and all of the things and he made mankind on the last day all right then when he finished making mankind then he rested on the seventh day and then you go through where Jesus said come and unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest that would be speaking of throughout the scriptures and showing how that the children of Israel then was commanded to uh they would work six years and then they would rest the seventh that was an example because of the way God done all right then you would have that you work six days and rest the Sabbath you work six years and rest the Sabbath or sabatical and and they would do those things as an example of what happened in the creation of mankind and man's creation was on the sixth day and you know physical creation that then Genesis 2 picks up and it really gives you a recap because really the man is created on the sixth day and it says there these are the generations of the heavens and the Earth and things so he's recapping the creation of life and things and then he comes down to the creation of mankind all right and we know in Genesis 2 Genesis 1 we've been covering verse 26- 28 of the creation of man where he says let us make man in our own image go ahead and pull that one up brother uh Richard and uh we'll read a little bit from Genesis 1 and we'll just you can read it as we scan down talking about it see then we've been through quite a lengthy discussion about how that man was made and we're talking about man now being made in the image of God because that's what the scripture said let us make man in our own image all right and God being a supernatural being you know then he created man first a supernatural being all right and that supernatural being would be there that he could as verse 28 talks about that he could rule the Earth the the animals Etc as a spiritual creation because that's in the image of God which is the interior part of us if you want to talk about it call it Soul being person of what we are you know you're you're made up of a body spirit and soul your body has five senses C taste feel smelling here your second realm of you has which is called a spirit realm it has like memory reason conscience affections Etc but then inside of a human being the difference between us and an animal the animal can have the senses up to a degree and it will work up to a degree you can train it to a degree it can do but it doesn't have a soul right because that was left for mankind to be a soul would be the image of God all right and that's what makes us so different from the animal you know the animal he's you you go out and tell the bird you need to build your nest a little different you know you go tell an eagle and he's got he's all of these thousands of years he's been going up in the highs of the rocks and you know he's been making his nest and putting it all up there and and you go up there and try to tell him so well you know it'd be more sensible if you got a little lower you know down closer to ground you wouldn't have to fly up so much but I'd say you know there's probably never very many snakes ever eats an egg of an eagle and the ones that gets closer to the ground they probably get a hold of but that eagle you can't tell him different why because he doesn't have a soul within himen all right but a man it says and we'll read it here you know as we read there and he became a uh form Man Out of the Dust of the earth and he breathed into his nostrils and he become a living Soul all right that soul of mankind is a great thing amen because that's like in the Old Testament when you had your animal sacrifices which were ordained of God to cover the sins of mankind but it could not eradicate it and there was nothing to be able to come back into the believer so he would do wrong you know he would commit adultery he would lie cheat steal Etc and as he did then he would go down and he would take a lamb and the lamb would be offered in his stead and his it would be marked off the things that he had done but yet he went right back with that same old desire to do wrong because he could not there was nothing to for the animal to be able to come back upon the human all right because the animal didn't have a soul right all right but see then we become into you know the point of being in a soul being soul is the word is being uh person you know and that's what we are and that's why Jesus Christ had to come and die to release his life the soul that would go out of him he said on the cross there you know my soul is troubled you know it had to be released out of there by death the where that he could come back into you and I to give us a new birth amen all right bring us in as as uh Jesus was talking to Nicodemus you know and he said you must be born again amen Nicodemus said you mean I've got to go back into my mother paraphrasing scripture but go back in my mother and be born a natural thing again and Jesus said if I tell you Earthly things or if I talk to you sensibly here and you don't understand me how you going to understand the great Heavenly things he said you must be born again all right so then it would be necess necessary that a human being to be anything in God we must be born again all right and to do that meant the soul of God would have to be released to where it could come back so on the day of Pentecost as we talk about there in the Bible when they were in the upper room and the Holy Spirit came it came down and it gave life to the people you know it gave a new birth all right 120 in the upper room then they went outside 3,000 later and it started the church coming into the point of Salvation all right just giving you a little fist run through and that would make then the the the soul of man Eternal by the new birth all right that's why we must be born again but that soul of natural man look at it the Bible says nothing was withholden from man and you look at it as we were talking about the other day you look at The Marvelous thing uh that they can do in science and technology because of being a human being right you know who would ever thought as I tell you the kind of little joke about it but there was a man sitting one day listening to them tell that one day this is well on back you know said one of these days they're going to be flying airplanes across the world and you know and you'll be traveling here and doing that and the man just gets up and he just you know he lets them have it he said you ain't nothing but crazy you know you're a bunch of idiots so he goes over to his two boys and he said let's get out of here come on Arville and Wilbur well you know your history right who was the first ones that flew the airplane they just didn't listen to Daddy you know what and it's not listening to Daddy they wound up flying our planes well now we can get in our plane and fly faster than the speed of s you know I mean you just travel around the world now almost like an almost instant and then you pick up your telephone and you can just dial IND you and you can talk to them y right our life it's not a pause and a problem you can talk to him live right why because man that soul of man that God made when he breed into Adam he became a living Soul amen that soul of man being made made that man higher than any animal could ever be thought of Amen right all right and in doing that that man would have control of the animals and even in our fallen estate you know even after the fall came you look at Mankind and after 6,000 years the animal is still afraid of man why see he smells the man coming into the woods the deer's gone right the virus smells the man he's leaving why because there's something about the animal that he he still has that connection to the fear of mankind all right why because of the soul of mankind amen cuz what have we done we come up with gun okay used to we shot little arrows you know you know or thr little Spar David would sling a rock you know and and I've always been amazed at them because reading your Bible you find out David had like 300 men that could throw at a highest breath you know I mean it ain't a gun in the country to hold a highest breath than 100 yards you know Miss at the highest breath and shoot it's impossible but those men so well trained but yet still look at the gun David was limited to the amount of distance he could throw we take a gun now it's dangerous for 5 miles they take these Sharpshooters they go out with these Special rifles and and they can just sit over there three or four miles away and just pick a guy off why because we've developed into such a high technology because of man having or being not just having a soul that's an odd way of saying it but man being a soul he turns out to be something marvelous even in his Fallen estate amen it's just unlimited what can happen you you look at it look at the uh brother Hal Thomas the other day was sister Anna you know Canard there you know you you she went they split her open they done triple by pass put her back together and say going home I'm wanting them to get around to where they can get they've getting to transplants on everything but I want a brain transplant you know I mean that's the one thing I want them to hurry up and do now I I want to choose who I the one I receive it from okay now just to make your life a little bit about life because what a marvelous thing we are look what man creat created it he he created us in such a marvelous situation until it used to be now it's kind of breaking down because of the deterioration but a newborn child used to be almost totally immune to any sickness for maybe the first six months right but now it's like I said everything's deteriorating so bad but what about God making something like you and I I don't have to tell my hand to move I I don't have to to force myself to speak you know I don't have to be trained to talk I never could figure out how you spell pneumonia with a p but they do but you know a little child that's 2 years old can say Daddy's got pneumonia will you think he knows what he's talking about no he's just heard it so we get a lot of training in our life but you know after a while he can go look it up in the dictionary right that's like Zach back there he he didn't like it when when they made him go to school and uh he you know kindergarten he didn't like it he turned against his mama and his Nanny and uh he even told his daddy said next time we go on vacation leave Mama at home cuz he didn't like it cuz it's making him go to school well they come to me and they said now Papa you got to do something you got to talk to that boy cuz he's upset with everybody and he don't want to go to school well I sat down and I talked with him and I said now listen Zach I said I want you to know a little something I said you remember when you're sitting around at about two or three months before Christmas or something and we're we're sitting there and we're going to get you a gun you don't know what that is do you said no I said because you don't know your you know you're you're not trained you you can't spell you can't do I said but if you go to school and you listen and you learn I said nobody won't be able to spell around you these big old words that you don't know what they are you know what he went the next day and he started making good grades right it was just a contact that was made with him because of what the soul that was within him not because of his human intelligence but because of a soul that was within him that you can contact all right now salvation then is a birth in the soul so I'm not speaking today to your head because you're sitting there thinking well I wish he'd hurry up and how long is he going to be and I want to get home I want to go get something to eat what are we going to have for lunch you know my Bottom's hurting my head's hurting this is hurting but see I'm trying to talk to the inside of you Amen to get you to think that part that's within us called a soul is a wonderful thing amen yes sir and he made man on the sixth day and he breathed into his nostrils verse 7 and he become a living Soul when a baby is born naturally all right that baby when it comes into life I know science says they're living in the wound and all this that and the other but just remember the animals the same way all right the animal in the wound is the same as a human in the wound I don't believe that it becomes a living Soul until God breathes the breath of life into the child and then it comes forth as a living Soul all right it it takes and it seems odd now here's an animal that doesn't have a soul and it seems odd of what happens in your first birth you know you can take a six week old puppy you can set it on the table it'll walk over to the edge and look off right it has enough intelligence not to move any further but the human being has to be trained a lot cuz you take a a six or eight 9 10 months some of our kids just kind of slow walking okay wa was 16 before he ever got where he could walk straight but you take that baby and you put it out you know what it'll do it'll crawl onside and fall right off the table but yet the intelligence in that baby is already vastly superior to the Animal Kingdom right because it it can goo it can do things and it'll start talking but yet see God knew when he made the man like that he made him special where he could talk to him amen made him where he could deal with him and fellowship with him because it's what he wanted if you want to take just a wording of it to say God was lonely amen right why because he was self-existing is the the best words we can get you know when you can go back to Elohim and all like that do the scholars they come up with the word Elohim to EXP BL self-existing and he existed alone but he was lonely he wanted something to fellowship with right you know he brought you an eye into being it was not enough to bring the animals he' already created the Angels right he created the animals he created all the world he had a lot to fellowship with but there was nothing like him cuz the animals not like him right it's you and I now physically speaking we come in image of the animal life because we were to be made higher and God done that where it could confuse mankind I don't believe in evolution but I do believe in Creative Evolution amen I believe God created one animal created another one another one another one another one higher order and that way the stupidity of mankind of Darwin and his theory of evolution could come up and conf you know destroy man's faith in God by saying we're just nothing but just a a monkey well we may act like it but that's a lot of difference in acting like in being one you know but we're in the highest form that could be and by putting that soul in mankind that was made in the image of God then we could be contacted all right and it took 4,000 years of Earthly time for God to deal with Mankind and trying to get him to to come to him for salvation and like I said then it had to be that he had to come and die to release that life to be able to come back in you and I to give us a new birth amen that way then we could be contacted all right then think about it God thought enough of you and I to step down in human flesh that body was not God that was a human creation Hebrews 10:5 a body thou has prepared me but inside of that body was the very Soul and Spirit of almighty God that's why Jesus could say unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins that's why he would say they when they said show us the father he said have I been so long with you he said if you seen me youve seen the father that's scripture that's why we believe in the one true and living God not in the Trinity concept because that goes on over into too far because God is not a Trinity there's no such word in the Bible all right now but see then we we want to be come towards his image we wouldn't going to come towards a three person image right because even the says the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see now I'm quoting scripture all right I'm a human being I'm a father I'm a son I have many many manifestations of myself but I'm only one and know was the way God was amen he come into being to die on a tree he said but God can't die hey come on you're right God can't die but he died in flesh that flesh died because the life EX did out of the flesh right into thy hands I commend my spirit all right out of that human body that we call Jesus God stepped out of it amen and left it hanging there on the cross they finally put it in the Tomb and he was busy doing some other work and when he was he came back picked up that body raised it in a glorified State all right but that's what he wants with me and you am he wants you and I to come to a place to where that we realize what's within us by the new birth amen we see what we are we're humans sold under sin right as we say about a little baby you know I mean there's a baby you know yourself you you raised him two years old he's got cookie all over his hand he's got cookie all over his face and you say did you get a cookie and he said right now who teaches him to lie that's right you know who taught the child to lie mama don't lie daddy don't lie of course A lot of times they do and they hear us too right you remember there in the Bible where the 40 the shoe buyers come out and eat up to 42 children you know Elisha you know the reason it was cuz Mama and Daddy was up fire saying go up old ballhead old ballhead said Elijah went up Elisha you talking about doing something too see sometimes we do put our kids in a lot of trouble because of our lying but you get the point we just we just naturally born to liar you hate to look at a little baby and say you ain't nothing but a liar but it's a truth they why up be that way why because we're born in Satan's domain out here this is his kingdom he offered it to Jesus right are you in the Bible right he offered to Jesus the world and the things and Jesus said no I'll pay the price that's right all right but see in doing that man is in the image of God God is just one and man is just one amen all right and see then that way we can look at God or or Mankind and and we can see and understand God because we see one another and KN who and we know who we are and know you know what's going on but see in that then we look at it that when he made the man we know that he made man and all the animal forms right all the animal forms he made male and female dog cat horse everything monkeys he made male and female but when he made Adam he just made Adam read your Bible we'll we'll come through a part of it taking pull that up and he just made Adam then he took a rib from Adam and made Eve all and Adam said now she's Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone she's a part of me that's the way a true husband and wife ought to be right after 55 years you know me and my wife would be going to town she said do you want I said yeah I want it done you understand what I mean she's asking where we going to eat and I'm not talking about eating I'm said y'all want it done I want it cooked or she'll say something I said what do you want to eat and she'll say uh I don't know whatever I said how do you want that cooked you know how do you cook whatever what I'm getting at is we Fellowship we talk about you know we we can bypass a lot of the whole line of talking right true husband and wife becomes one they can just byp pass that and you're thinking alike you even start looking alike right now a lot of people don't like that but that's true I can go into the science side of that that's Joyce and Danny never had a like of me to talk like that she's blonde he's blackheaded I ain't talking about that is after a while you start looking alike why because you're around each other so much all right but now think about it there as man was lonely as God was lonely and he wanted to bring man into existence where he could fellowship with him then when he brings Adam into existence he cannot fellowship with Eve because he's not in existence yet so he puts Adam to sleep and he takes a reib out right Genesis 2 and he makes him a help meet we miss that a lot because we want to use the word helpmate but it does not say that it says help meat me T it doesn't see say help mate m a t e go two men can be a mate two women can be a mate right right that's just meaning companion connections but a help meat means one of you or part of you Adam said she's Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone she was part of him amen now they were in the garden they could rule the garden and take care of it right well because they were in the image of God that inside part of them was in the image of the very God Amen Eve could say Adam the wind's blowing a little too strong you just say peace be still right right you want to see that again what did Jesus do when he was walking when they were out on the sea and he comes walking on the water I mean read your Bible come on he comes walking on the water walks right out to him and they were scared to death because the waves were going and just up and down and he just simply says peace be still the winds and the waves just calms away why because that was that man again standing on the earth that you and I should have been like amen right but we got all confused in the fall it was in the garden we got all messed up if you want to call it in our terminologies today our old flu got stopped up now you know what happens to a boiler or anything that the flu is get stopped up it's going to blow up somewhere and that's what happened in the garden is Satan begin to talk to Eve right and as he begin to talk to Eve he got her to reason and reasoning is fine because the Bible says come let us reason together that's fine if it stays with God and His word correctly amen all right but when we take Satan's ideas Paul said it later he said that we be uh confused or paraphrasing it saying that we wind up being uh like Eve who fell for Satan's lie right and see Satan had to to get some Road the devil as we call him uh he had to get some Road into the human race to be able to confuse you and I amen and as he did he picked Eve because Adam he could not do anything with him Adam in his original state the devil could not do anything with Adam because Adam was in the image of God right not degrading the woman because Eve was in Adam and you know how I preach and what I believe the Bible doesn't say in Eve all dies the Bible says in Adam all died right no matter what Eve done it was Adam who accepted the responsibility of the fact of what the Fallen condition was and he took Eve right right had he not done that God would have annihilated her right but yet he loved her he he cared for her she was part of him she had been there with him no telling how long that they would have been in the garden cuz remember it was in the day of rest that they fell right in the seventh day that was coming out as we would talk about the rest day and as it did she winds up in listening to Satan in his life say you'll be as God knowing good and evil you know and he begins to talk to her and he tells her said you were created for the purpose that's right but Adam is withholding that from you and so is God he's withholding from you the the fact of what you were created for you were created for multiplication and if it did then Eve went the wrong way with it right we can go through the serpent seed of what happened because you got to admit the Bible talks about a seed of the serpent all right but I'm not wanting to get onto that as much is to get on to one thing when mankind was made he was made in the image of God to desire after God to want to fellowship with him right God wanted that he loved it he could come down as we talk about it in the cool of the evening the prophet would say it this way come down in the cool of the evening and fellowship with Adam and Eve and he need lay them down put them to sleep and said you know wake up the next morning beautiful everything was running perfect in the garden why because they were there the way they were supposed to be right all right there was no sin there was no problem no heartaches no troubles and God would come down and fellowship with them you said well do you mean God came down well the Bible does say that when they done wrong God came down and said Adam Where Art Thou see God is not a um we want to talk about him as John 5:24 or something God is his Spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth that's wonderful that's truth but you mean to tell me that you and I are something greater than he is you I mean look at us look what he made think about it they're talking about brother how Thomas now to put a little pacemaker in what about they just they just go through and they just drill a little hole and they go right through your rib cage and they just drill this thing into your heart and it's a screw but on the screw in I guess is what what is electrodes or whatever they're far and uh they just connect some wires to it put a little thing in there about size of a silver dollar and brother Thomas's heart rate went from 40 or 50 up to 80 you know amazing thing that mankind can do right I said they can take out a kidney put back in a kidney they could take out a heart right and even had a man live for how long a month or something one time with a mechanical heart you remember that when they first started what wonderful things mankind can do right unlimited to the things right you can almost travel like a thought because as I said about the telephone while ago you tell me that's not doing like a thought but you can talk straight to Africa used to even in the the beginnings you know they had to you had space and you could call and it spaced and you had to space out the hours Etc but now it's almost just instantly why because we're human beings but we've taken what God has given us the ability to think to reason to work out things we've taken that and we spin it all on the scientific side and thank God for automobiles I know Donnie he likes m models and they're beautiful to sit out there and look at but I'm not going to California with him in an a model now just not going why because we going to have to work on it all the way out there in back if we make it if I'm going to California give me a Cadillac let's go or get on airplane and go modern technology is great but you just think about what God what we've done with that we made everything so instant you know like was it John and Charles Wesley it was recorded of her that I think she had 12 kids I believe that's right and it was recorded of how many hours a day she sent with her spent with her children praying and and reading to them at night we know they didn't have washers and dryers and and stoves to cook and you know refrigerators to keep things in and this that and the other you know and here we are we got everything yep my wife she wanted a dishwasher years ago I got her one but she wouldn't do the dishes cuz that's Anna yeah you know I mean we got her a dishwasher but she wouldn't wash the dishes right but we did buy our dishwasher it's used about one time every 3 months because she doesn't like it all but yet other people you know they'll just take everything boy everything comes off goes to the dishwasher you never touch it you just get ready to put them on the table take them up put them over here you know everything's great praise the Lord man I used to get up over morning before going to school when I was able to go to school cuz I play on the me most of the time but you have to get up and draw water from Mom them to boil and do the wash now you just going and flop in that's it but my point is what happened to the time you know my wife's got ever modern invention can be thought of in the kitchen I still don't have no time she don't have time to do this out of that why she's in the kitchen but you got all these modern inventions what would she be if she was having to get up build a fire in the wood Stone do all of the things and see we've let these things that Satan has brought in to us Captivate us and take us away from really what we need to be we don't want to throw those things away no way no I don't want to go back to horse and buggy uhuh no no way I like it where we're at I like the air conditioner I like the heater I like those things don't you I like to be able to go downtown and buy uh I love Dr Pepper so we go get a Dr Pepper sit in the refrigerator and you know man you're just drinking Dr Pepper and modern inventions are wonderful but is it taking us so far away from God until we've forgotten about him right that's my whole point if he created us for worship created us for the basis of you know to come down and fellowship with us you know you wake up a lot during the night I do I wake up a lot during night get up and walk through the house you know what I don't blame God and saying well hey you're getting too old you're getting this you're getting old man you're getting to yeah you know no I said Thank you Lord for waking me up I do have the ability to walk through the house I have the ability to talk to you and that's when I pray a lot is just in the middle of the night because it's quieter well you know what in the middle of the night everybody else is asleep so me and God can talk he's not busy on the phone answering everybody else right he can talk to me and I like it that way CU I want to fellowship with him because that's what we need to be why not he made us right he created us he gave us life amen amen why wouldn't we want to give it back to him amen why would we not want to be just happy and have a good time as a Christian you got to run around with a sad face oh I'm a Christian I'm happy though no you ain't happy your face can't say it Jesus one day said there must have been a comical joke about it because Jesus told oh Herod one day he said go tell that fox it must have been a joke about Herod as being a fox see why can't we be happy as Christians right laughter the Bible says is a good medicine oh you get up every day oh I feel so bad you know what you do you a little bit you're going to feel bad you know what she going to be down to the doctor's office and he's going to be giving you some pills trying to make you feel good when I get up and be happy and say thank you Lord for salvation in my soul thank you for loving me and caring for me and giving me your own life brother Dale you're never down and out what's the saying around here when you call me what do I say laying in the hospital but what do I say hey I'm doing wonderful how are you why because he don't need bragging on the devil he got enough as it is right he got enough people going down that's what I tell the doctor I don't mind talking to them doctors just like I talked to you I told that the other day when he's thumping on my chest to check my spleen thing out and I said what are you doing that far he said well I'm checking your spleen I said Oh I thought you was doing that just make me think I was you that was something you supposed to do to let me know you was a doctor he just died laughing I don't you know why because he's a person just like we are I appreciate him thank God for doctors but thank God for the healing as brother col I read the scripture that he sent his word and healed us and Deliver Us from destruction sir why can't we accept it why can't we realize what we've been made for as it says there in Genesis 1 128 you remember the other day when we were talking about we told Adam and Eve in their spiritual condition to multiply and replenish the Earth amen you realize that's what we're doing that's what I'm trying to do now is to take the word and talk to you about it and talk about God and his ways and and things to just to to try to get you to see the God that I serve why because he wants to talk to you he said now you're the preacher right don't have too with it no he wants to talk to all of his children amen right he wants to deliver he wants to do in all of the things to you and I but think about it now in the creation of Eve she wasn't made wrong she was made beautiful the most beautiful woman that was in the world probably ever will be in the world was Eve and Adam was happy as they could walk in the garden together and fellowship together why because she began to learn about God too y of what God's purpose and the things was for and see that's what you and I ought to be doing it's learning about God study his word you want to know about God read his word don't read a G's omac try to find about God no you find out how to plant your garden but read the Bible what's wrong with that have we throw it away now read it like I've told you they could have figured out in space you remember when they were trying to put the the all of the astronauts in space they wind up a day missing and they couldn't figure out how to get that all of those calculations together when one man there happened to be a a Christian and they said was anything you know of to where we can figure this out and he said yes in the Bible said the Bible says that there he asked a question when man did and and the son stood still with Joshua and it says about a day so they run their time calculations back to that period and they picked up all of the day except about this 20 minutes or 40 minutes or something that they liked in their calculations and asked him said is there anything else he said yes said one time a man was dying and said God told him he wasn't going to die said he asked well how can it I be assured of this he said it's easy thing for the sun to go forward it said Let It Go backward you remember that in the Bible and it went back so many degrees that turned out to be the 20 minutes had they read their Bible they could have put the astronauts in space right and they had to come back to the Bible to find the answer to all things well it's got the answer to all of us but he made man and instilled within man the love for him he put everything under his control to where he would be the god of the earth if you want to call call him Jesus said you call him gods that the word come to we're not the god of Heaven no but we are the children of God Amen and the Earth is our domain right amen see we have a lot to do with that's what I was talking about a moment ago when you talking about smiling and talking and fellowshipping and joyous and happy we have a lot to do in this domain that we can conquer Satan amen you go into a doctor's office brother gir there his daddy was a chief surgeon of deap General Hospital for many years and he said the first thing he wanted them to do when they came into his office was to have a positive attitude that we were talking about this morning the lady brother random was talking about that brother around simply said to her said you've had this thing for you walk with these crutches for 2 years she had an opportunity right there to to be able to get over her understanding and get away with those crutches but she said yes and said I've I've had them for 5 years he said and you will keep them why because she had lost all contact with trying to serve God in the right way she was more interested what the doctor said right well why can't we look at him in this life life and that doctor told me to take my kneecaps off 40 years ago that's what he told me he said Don't Take Your kneecaps off said do we out I said so what you're not taking my kneecaps off I laughed at him he laughed back I liked him he come in there with paint all over him he was my kind of a doctor and he said I and talk to him he said well I have to take him off Sam I said you're not going to take them off well I still got him amen you want to go walk in the woods for about some hunting land you know no 73 year old man that's like these guys will tell you he'll work you to death why what if IID accepted what that doctor said CU well the doctor said he going to take my kneecaps off you know what he took them off for long cuz he proved with proved me on the x-rays why that make any difference God didn't tell me and I questioned God I said what no so I laughed at him I said you ain't taking him off why can't we be like that when they told me I had leukemia I said no chemo do what you want to with this whole body but there'll be no chemo I said because you're on that side of the table man and I'm on this side I'm the preacher puts them in the grave you're the guy that doctors them that's the way I talk to doctors cuz they're human beings they said you won't give me that now I'm not telling you not to take it but I'm just telling you God talk to me and I said no well I'm still alive they finally come around and said well hey Sam what you got is the kind that that don't kill you I said well okie dokie so what I'm 73 years old I supposed to have a lot right but if I get up every day oh I'm 73 now get up with a positive attitude you know there's a lot of people that can't get up right to have a positive attitude why because God is positive that's right he said his word and healed us he said amen right all right and we're brought here for the one purpose to serve God Amen that's what we need to do Eve was taken from Adam don't start counting your ribs guys and see if there's one missing Eve was taken from Adam to be part of Adam right and a true wife is a part of her husband right we got these songs today I stand by my man right my lady made it got 14 husbands right she already to say I stood by my men instead of man but true lying through her teeth but it's the truth you ought to stand by you man is your husband that's right he's your helpmate he's the one to help you right amen a true husband and wife is a wonderful situation cuz that's in the image of God Amen you put them both together trying to be right and you see something right but you put them pulling and bickering and arguing first two years I told you you don't like my way of preaching but that's all right I told you the first time you marry you marry for lust right harmones is a factor you say oh love at first sight now I want to see that somewhere ain't no such thing as love at first sight you learn to love that's right that's right right y there was things my wife didn't like about me when me her married but you know what she loved me she got over it he said what are you talking about I'm talking about God making a man and making that man so much like him until it's an amazing thing that a man can be be right God wanted that fellowship with that man right amen he wanted the ability to come down in the garden and talk to Adam and Eve amen and he'd like to do that today to you and I if we just let him brother you believe in God talking to people I sure do I sure do it may be an inward speaking to you but what maybe that's the way he talk to Adam and Eve where we're talking about life not in Bible study I ask the question a lot of times and people laugh at me because it's not a dumb question maybe but I said if you say dog in Spanish are you thinking dog or are you speaking what is it perago ever I can't pronounce them but then we asked another sister what was hers in in Swahili you know and I said when you think of dog why don't you just say dog well you know what they're say dog but it's in their language that's right and you know that God can understand every language in the world right that's right you don't have to figure out how to talk to him just talk to him amen right brother D do you get down and you cry you no no sometimes I do sometimes I don't sometimes I walk around through the house just like if you heard me you say who in the world is he talking to I'm just talking to him I'm saying Lord now you know my problems my troubles and what I need I don't have to beg him plead with him no I just have to believe that he hears me cuz the Bible said if he Hearth us we have the petition that we ask for why because we're in His image think about it mankind a marvelous wonderful ful creation and God came down to be with mankind amen that's right and you know he didn't come down as a glob or a monkey looking something or whatever he came down to look just like us I believe when we get to heaven you know what we're going to see God not as a spirit floating around not as a doing because to me God is a being he's a person right right he's wonderful and he made man wonderful just like we're talking about a wife I'll end it with this talking about like even the prophet of God said one day like this he said God couldn't give a man nothing no greater than Sal you know Salvation is first but he said God give a man a good wife that's right that's a wonderful thing do you and Nanny get along and don't never fuss no no we have our problem she's her and I'm me and most of it's me I don't mind admitting that it's like I've always said to you I wouldn't care for my wife knowing any thought I ever had can you say that I would never care from my wife knowing every thought I had if she would hear the last one I had about the situation the first one might not be too good right cuz I'm a human being but the last one I have is thank you God for giving me a good helpmate meet part of me but most of all I thank him for salvation my kids are here my grandkids are here thank God for that I thank him for salvation am cuz that's the number one thing he told Nicodemus he said you must be born again Nicodemus said I don't understand you if you look the original up in the Greek you'll find it it say You must be born from above cuz that's where he came from that's right but he came down to where we could have what he had right amen he turn eternal life let's go come on just let's think on these things what is man that are mindful of in the Bible says are the son of man right he created us for the purpose of us to worship him but we must do as the Bible says worship Him in spirit and in truth so I want to know the truth about it don't you and then I know how to worship why because he's the god of creation he's the god of worship go ahead listen 291 291 anybody have a need the altar is open we love to pray for the sick we love to pray for salvation why because it's all in the same atonement we believe in healing we believe in Deliverance and guidance stand here and talk all afternoon about the things God has
