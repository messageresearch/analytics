[0:02] three
[0:03] languages
[0:08] amen
[0:10] see everybody's back for more
[0:13] amen praise the Lord
[0:16] well let's just open up in a word of
[0:17] prayer this morning
[0:19] precious Lord Jesus we thank you Father
[0:21] once again Lord for giving us this
[0:23] opportunity Lord to come to your house
[0:24] Lord Jesus and oh God just to Fellowship
[0:28] Lord with your people Lord God and we
[0:30] pray you bless this day Lord bless the
[0:32] Sunday School of service Lord Jesus and
[0:34] oh God just speak to all of us Lord
[0:36] Jesus as we're on this journey of Life
[0:38] father God and we just need you to guide
[0:40] us and keep us Lord bless this topic and
[0:42] be with us this morning we commit the
[0:45] service into your hands in Jesus
[0:46] Christ's name amen praise the Lord
[0:50] so I thank the Lord the lot has fallen
[0:53] on me again to give another Sunday
[0:54] school a lesson as uh brother Bob put it
[0:58] so um we're going to get right into it
[1:00] by the grace of the Lord so I'm sure
[1:02] from the last
[1:04] Jubilee Sunday school you've been
[1:07] spending you've been saving you've been
[1:10] hopefully paying off some debt and
[1:12] hopefully you also been giving
[1:15] so um that's a it's a daily thing as
[1:17] said before
[1:19] that you know money is one of those
[1:21] things that we we do daily in between
[1:23] service some of us are going to go out
[1:25] and buy lunch some people are going to
[1:26] eat lunch downstairs so which money is
[1:27] always a factor that's
[1:29] that we have to deal with
[1:31] but I love Jubilee and we'll go to the
[1:33] next slide
[1:34] because Jubilee always says you know no
[1:37] matter how long they had been in bondage
[1:39] how long they were supposed to stay
[1:41] there when the Year of Jubilee come of
[1:44] the Jubilee when the trumpet sounded
[1:45] every man could go free if he wanted to
[1:48] go free
[1:49] and as we talk about financial Jubilee
[1:51] remember we're not just talking about
[1:53] money we're talking about all of God's
[1:55] promises that's there for us
[1:58] there for us if we wanted but again the
[2:01] world has many many things set up to
[2:03] prevent us from going on with the things
[2:06] that we hear in God's word
[2:08] but money is one of those things again
[2:09] we can all relate to from the youngest
[2:12] to the oldest we can relate to it those
[2:15] who are handling money well you got kids
[2:17] coming up
[2:18] you got grandkids coming up so all of
[2:21] these lessons need to continue
[2:23] and they need to see us be an example so
[2:26] they can see because the world and the
[2:28] Devil he's setting examples he's setting
[2:30] things up that they can see and they're
[2:32] looking at our lives
[2:34] how are we handling this thing called
[2:36] money
[2:37] next slide
[2:42] and our prophet in 1965 way before I was
[2:45] born many of you were probably young or
[2:48] some of you were born after this he said
[2:51] clean your lives up pay your debts oh no
[2:54] man Jesus said get all things off your
[2:56] hands get everything right Make Ready
[2:59] Get Ready remember in the name of the
[3:02] Lord something is fixing to happen
[3:06] praise the Lord keep that always in your
[3:08] mind as we live our lives that we should
[3:10] have clean lives paying our debts owing
[3:13] no man just the way Jesus said getting
[3:15] all things off of our hands so that
[3:16] we're ready we're ready for whatever the
[3:18] Lord has for us and we know the promises
[3:21] that he has for us and our Prophet is
[3:23] saying something is fixing to happen and
[3:26] this is amazing to me you know way
[3:27] before I was born this quote was out
[3:29] there of course I didn't know it to very
[3:32] very late
[3:33] but it was out there just as the word is
[3:36] out here all the promises is still there
[3:38] and we need to be able to practice these
[3:40] things so we can believe God's
[3:42] principles and practice them so our
[3:45] faith can grow by the grace of the Lord
[3:49] next slide
[3:52] I'm gonna hit on some of the principles
[3:54] a couple of the principles that we've
[3:55] talked about and kind of put a little
[3:56] context behind it and share a little
[3:58] testimony with it so we know the
[4:02] principle and we know this and we we all
[4:04] know this in God's word plainly states
[4:06] that God owns it all
[4:07] he owns it all and if we just pause for
[4:10] a minute and we think that our father he
[4:13] owns it all
[4:15] right now and if we say that but to
[4:18] really get to where we're believing it
[4:20] we got to have something to practice on
[4:23] something that increases our faith that
[4:25] we can believe God truly owns it all our
[4:27] father really really does Own It All
[4:31] we have to manage his resources
[4:33] diligently that's that's what his word
[4:36] calls for for us to be diligent and
[4:38] diligent that word again it means
[4:40] characterized by Steady Earnest
[4:42] energetic and painstaking work just to
[4:45] keep something in order we got to manage
[4:47] what he gives us diligently
[4:50] remember money costs your time if you
[4:52] waste money you're wasting the time that
[4:54] you put in to earn that money
[4:57] be patient we know we heard that message
[4:59] last week about patience wonderful we
[5:01] have to be patient we have to give God
[5:03] an opportunity to work and avoid debt
[5:06] like a curse we got to avoid debt like a
[5:09] curse that's for sure if you go to the
[5:12] Old Testament it's a blessing for
[5:13] obedience
[5:15] God told Moses and he told the children
[5:17] of Israel he said the Lord shall open
[5:19] unto thee his good treasure the heaven
[5:21] to give thee Reign unto thy land in his
[5:24] season and to bless all the work of
[5:26] thine hand and thou shall lend unto many
[5:28] nations and thou shall not borrow
[5:32] and the Lord shall make Thee the head
[5:33] and not the tail and thou shall be above
[5:36] only and thou shalt not be beneath if
[5:39] that thou hearken unto the Commandments
[5:41] of the Lord thy God which I command thee
[5:43] this day to observe and to do them
[5:46] amen now that was to Israel and we're
[5:49] spiritual Israel so we should be even
[5:51] greater than that you say well how am I
[5:53] going to lend to Nations well it's very
[5:56] simple when you put money into your bank
[5:58] account a checking account for example
[5:59] or a savings account the bank they take
[6:02] that money and they lend to other people
[6:03] that's how they make their money they
[6:06] charge them a higher interest rate than
[6:07] they would pay you and that's how they
[6:09] make their money so if you have money
[6:11] that you're saving in a bank account you
[6:14] can fulfill that scripture by lending to
[6:17] many and that's what God wants us to be
[6:19] he wants us to feel like we are the head
[6:21] but in order to do that we got to fight
[6:23] we have to fight our way through this
[6:27] and financially it's it's in his word of
[6:30] course there's many many scriptures but
[6:32] we got to be skillful fighters in the
[6:34] word of God and what he wants
[6:36] and of course I say all of this you know
[6:38] as if I I never made mistakes and
[6:40] sometimes when I'm talking to the kids
[6:41] and I'm all charged up and I'm like oh
[6:44] you know but I gotta step back and be
[6:46] graceful because I made many mistakes I
[6:50] learned this from the ground up my
[6:51] brothers and sisters from the ground up
[6:54] and I'm going to share with you my
[6:56] testimony of the biggest mistake that I
[6:58] made as I told you before we got into
[7:00] business we lost all kind of money I
[7:03] didn't know what in the world was going
[7:04] on I was paying my tithes I thought I
[7:06] was living right and here it was in 2008
[7:09] the stock market and the housing market
[7:11] I mean went down my brother and I are
[7:13] just losing money left and right
[7:15] and I started saying Lord what's going
[7:17] on as I said before we we hustled we
[7:20] lost a ton of money but we paid it back
[7:22] and I started asking God like Lord show
[7:24] me what what am I doing wrong I remember
[7:26] laying in the bed thinking like Lord
[7:27] what am I doing wrong
[7:30] you know I we we were we grew up poor
[7:33] for sure and um as I said before you
[7:36] know God gave me an opportunity to go to
[7:37] college and that was all his grace
[7:38] that's part of my testimony I was um you
[7:42] know played around in school in high
[7:43] school I didn't do hardly anything we
[7:45] skipped class and my dad was a worker
[7:47] he's like hey just work y'all ain't
[7:48] gonna do good in school anyway you know
[7:50] you need to work and um so my brother
[7:53] he's a you know construction guy he
[7:55] worked hard I tried to hang with my dad
[7:57] and both of them out worked me out there
[7:59] I'm like I got to do something
[8:01] and um I went to uh we moved to a new
[8:04] school and I remember the principal
[8:06] telling me she said look if you skip
[8:08] school like how you've been doing you're
[8:09] going to jail
[8:11] you can't do that here and I'm like okay
[8:13] we're gonna we're gonna see
[8:16] what happened that day was very odd
[8:18] though the first class I believe was
[8:19] like the first or second day it was the
[8:21] last period of the day and the teacher
[8:23] that teacher was an English teacher very
[8:25] Stern teacher but some reason she looked
[8:28] at me and she said oh my God you you
[8:30] you're gonna do great you're gonna do
[8:32] amazing
[8:34] like I looked around like who was you
[8:36] talking to
[8:37] the principal came by the class that day
[8:40] she brought me in the hallway this
[8:42] teacher and said do you know this young
[8:44] man I still don't know what she was
[8:45] talking about the principal was looking
[8:47] at her like
[8:48] you don't know this young man
[8:52] but by the grace of the Lord that
[8:54] started something in my life that
[8:57] allowed me to just start doing well and
[8:59] did God just transformed my life I was
[9:01] able to go to college learned some
[9:03] things I thought I learned I started
[9:05] studying business and in college and got
[9:08] out of college and of course you know
[9:09] I'm making more money than I I ever
[9:11] thought I would make and got marriage to
[9:14] my beautiful wife and we're living life
[9:16] you know money coming in and money going
[9:18] out every day if we had a good budget I
[9:22] budgeted but I didn't know what I was
[9:23] doing everything came in everything went
[9:25] out and that lasted for years
[9:27] and I remember we started looking about
[9:29] we got a house and then you know we
[9:31] wanted to move to another neighborhood
[9:33] and let's go to the next slide
[9:35] and um
[9:36] they were building a new house and I was
[9:38] like yes I'm going to take care of my
[9:40] wife we're gonna get a new house man
[9:42] we're gonna Live It Up
[9:44] and we went to the house and I had no
[9:46] money again I was working and we got
[9:49] this house and I took out I told you a
[9:52] 40-year loan 40-year loan had two
[9:56] mortgages to pay for this home and this
[9:58] is one of the mortgages
[9:59] it was 302 thousand you know in Maryland
[10:03] a different price a different price
[10:04] range up north through 302 000 it was
[10:08] 6.375 interest rate 40 years all right
[10:10] and
[10:12] 1700 was the payment yes I thought yeah
[10:15] we could pay that I budgeted out I'm
[10:17] like yeah we could pay that and let's
[10:18] say hey let's get this house we're gonna
[10:20] be happy
[10:21] But as God started dealing with me and
[10:23] money and I started being diligent with
[10:25] his resources I started looking at this
[10:27] after we paid out all that business debt
[10:30] and I'm like Lord God you know what's
[10:32] going on and I start being diligent with
[10:33] the money that he was giving me and as I
[10:36] was looking at this and started really
[10:37] looking at what I had signed up for
[10:41] and I realized oh my Lord the interest
[10:44] on this loan is going to be 500
[10:47] something thousand the total if I just
[10:51] let this thing stay as it is I would be
[10:53] paying 800 000 for a home
[10:56] eight hundred thousand five hundred
[10:58] thousand dollars extra that I never
[11:00] intended to sign up I just wanted this
[11:02] house I was thinking I was going to get
[11:04] 300 000 for this house
[11:06] but see you see how the devil he gets us
[11:08] into these vines that we're not thinking
[11:10] about it we're not planning on doing it
[11:12] I just wanted a house for my family
[11:14] but the Devil he's out there to take the
[11:17] resources that God has given us to be a
[11:19] blessing and take it and give it to
[11:22] Wells Fargo
[11:23] I mean I'd much rather give Terence a
[11:25] hundred thousand instead of getting
[11:26] Wells Fargo 500 000.
[11:29] don't ask for it brother Terrace
[11:32] but truly I instead of giving 500 000
[11:36] extra
[11:37] to Wells Fargo
[11:39] what if I said God if I had that money
[11:41] Lord what would you have me do with it
[11:44] well that's what our father wants that's
[11:46] what he wants from us
[11:48] but thank God for his word that Jubilee
[11:51] it says no matter how long you had been
[11:53] in bondage or was supposed to be in
[11:56] bondage you could go free
[11:58] but I called Iran I would start an
[12:00] investigating I said you know
[12:02] here's the situation we got ton of debt
[12:04] I'm just paying bills living paycheck to
[12:06] paycheck started emailing anybody I
[12:09] could find and I remember one person
[12:11] saying hey look you need to get rid of
[12:12] this house you're in over your head and
[12:15] I'm like I do but I got a baby we had
[12:18] two kids I'm like Lord God what do we do
[12:21] but thank God for his grace praise the
[12:24] Lord for his grace let's go to the next
[12:26] slide
[12:28] so now the people today are expecting
[12:30] God to reach down
[12:34] get them by the neck say yes that's
[12:36] right you bring me out clean me up heal
[12:38] me and I'll believe you God doesn't do
[12:39] his business that way he gives you the
[12:42] promise but you have got to fight for
[12:43] every inch of ground that you possess
[12:46] praise the Lord that's it he wanted us
[12:49] to fight our way through my mama so we
[12:52] started praying I started getting my
[12:54] wife and saying okay we got this
[12:56] situation we're gonna have to cut down
[12:58] on everything that we have I didn't know
[13:00] if we were going to sell this house or
[13:01] not but no matter what we had a 40-year
[13:03] loan 2007
[13:06] 2047 would be paid off
[13:09] if we kept what the world had signed us
[13:12] up for and I kept living my life and I
[13:13] could I could have just kept going on
[13:15] but after God starts showing me this
[13:17] stuff and I'm like okay we need to fight
[13:20] our way through we cut down and this is
[13:22] the same thing if you're in this
[13:23] situation or if you can start seeing
[13:26] what God has for you if you apply these
[13:28] principles you can see where he will
[13:30] take you
[13:31] mama so we started fighting cutting down
[13:34] stop eating out and these are hopefully
[13:36] you're getting principles as I'm talking
[13:37] through all of this cutting down we
[13:39] start saying okay instead of eating out
[13:41] like we used to eat out all the time and
[13:43] we would always be at restaurants and we
[13:45] pay for everybody it's like man we just
[13:47] living it up 300 200 I mean every Sunday
[13:50] was going out with somebody
[13:52] but after this we start cutting down my
[13:54] goodness we start saying hey we're going
[13:55] to have a budget I'll eat out fifty
[13:58] dollars a month
[13:59] you know that's it we're gonna enjoy
[14:01] that Mickey D's we're gonna Max it out
[14:04] with coupons but it tastes so much
[14:06] better I'm telling you when you know
[14:08] what you're doing and you're letting God
[14:09] lead you it tastes I mean it was like
[14:12] steak man you wanted every french fry to
[14:15] last I'm telling you
[14:17] but that's the gratefulness that start
[14:19] coming out if something broke we started
[14:20] fixing it because we're like hey we
[14:22] cannot spin anything extra we got a
[14:25] problem
[14:26] we got a 40-year problem on our hand
[14:29] we're in bondage
[14:31] praise the Lord Jesus and we started
[14:33] knuckling down selling things that we
[14:35] didn't need and just being diligent
[14:37] still enjoyed ourselves but everything
[14:38] we just cut down
[14:40] cut down we started using cash instead
[14:42] of credit cards and things like that
[14:43] sister Alicia would go to the store and
[14:45] yeah people gotta wait behind you as you
[14:47] take out cash and you count it out and
[14:50] something goes over instead of your
[14:51] credit card you slide it right something
[14:53] 10 cents go over a dollar thirty dollars
[14:55] forty dollars but when you cut down we
[14:57] had to do this just cash well we could
[15:00] still designate what we want we could
[15:02] still say Okay I want you know 300 in
[15:04] groceries every two weeks but let's hold
[15:08] it to that
[15:09] okay that's being diligent you can
[15:11] decide as a family what we're going to
[15:13] do together
[15:15] okay if your wife likes to shop
[15:17] she might want 300. well Brothers you
[15:21] may have to work a little harder do you
[15:24] want 500 but talk her down a little bit
[15:26] maybe but designate what you want to
[15:29] give and manage that that's how you
[15:31] start getting diligent and we did that
[15:33] by May of 2013
[15:37] five years later still owe 240 thousand
[15:40] dollars
[15:42] still trying to make it fighting our way
[15:43] through
[15:44] by the grace of almighty God praise the
[15:48] Lord and this is where the grace of God
[15:50] comes in see he's our father he owns it
[15:52] all right as you start listening to him
[15:55] and obeying his principles he started
[15:57] adding Grace to it he gives you Grace
[15:59] you're still finding your way through
[16:01] but he's giving you Grace in your fight
[16:03] because he knows you will win that's the
[16:06] wonderful thing about our father right
[16:08] if you fight you will win
[16:11] if you're expecting to not fight you
[16:13] will lose
[16:15] you see that's he's letting that that
[16:17] that be known okay we have to fight our
[16:20] way through right every inch all of the
[16:24] promises we know we have to fight our
[16:26] way through
[16:27] by August of 2017 and and we see we
[16:31] still wanted certain things I remember
[16:33] saving for a fence this was a big thing
[16:34] my wife and I always talked about we
[16:35] wanted a fence in our backyard and after
[16:38] we got away from credit we started
[16:40] saving for those things so I finally
[16:41] saved up ten thousand dollars for a
[16:43] fence big yard like yes but this debt
[16:47] was stand right at me and I said Lord
[16:50] God okay
[16:51] I remember having a little conversation
[16:53] what do you think
[16:55] okay do you think we'll get this fence
[16:56] or put it on the debt and she didn't
[16:59] really think much she said oh well if
[17:00] you want to put it on a debt so once I
[17:02] got that green light I'm like all right
[17:04] I won't ask two times it's going on the
[17:07] fence it's going on the house I'm sorry
[17:09] so we take that 10 000 put it on the on
[17:12] the house brought it down like wow
[17:15] behind every loan there's something
[17:16] called an amortization schedule and it
[17:19] gives you the breakdown of every payment
[17:21] and every interest charge if you have
[17:24] debt I think that's a very important
[17:25] thing for you to have because it'll show
[17:27] you your interest costs so as I started
[17:30] seeing this interest cost at every extra
[17:31] payment I would make I would be saving
[17:34] something and I knew God wanted me to
[17:36] have this at Wells Fargo so if I could
[17:38] pay a little extra and and turn cut out
[17:41] some of that interest one extra payment
[17:43] I would save Seventeen hundred dollars
[17:47] a month
[17:48] one extra payment I would save Seventeen
[17:51] hundred dollars
[17:53] okay so as I started looking at five
[17:55] hundred thousand pay one extra payment
[17:56] it will cut down I would pay it
[17:59] started feeling the benefit of that
[18:01] Seventeen hundred dollars that God would
[18:03] have for me instead of me paying it off
[18:04] to Wells Fargo
[18:07] by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[18:09] his grace by August of 2017 I made the
[18:13] final payment on that house
[18:15] by his grace
[18:17] [Applause]
[18:19] by his grace so I stand Here believing
[18:22] what I'm saying it is impossible two
[18:26] hundred and forty thousand I don't make
[18:27] that kind of money
[18:29] by the grace of the Lord Jesus
[18:31] but by his grace and his grace adding to
[18:34] it blessing doing different things a job
[18:37] of bonus will come through and things
[18:39] like that
[18:40] and I would put it on the house forget
[18:42] it I didn't want to buy something extra
[18:43] I wanted to save that five hundred
[18:45] thousand dollars by the all grace of God
[18:48] and it's the same promises ever is for
[18:51] all of us let's go to the next slide
[18:54] he says if you've got a shadow of the
[18:58] power of God in you you got power to do
[19:00] it God is omnipotent see what I mean the
[19:03] power that's in you will make you could
[19:06] speak a world into existence and go live
[19:08] on it Hallelujah there you are that's
[19:10] what power is in the church now but it's
[19:13] controlled by a law it's a law of Faith
[19:15] Jesus said all things are possible to
[19:17] them that believe and if you can believe
[19:19] it whatever God will lead your soul to
[19:22] believe pay attention to these words
[19:24] whatever he will lead your soul to
[19:26] believe that is yours every place The
[19:30] Souls of your foot can set upon by faith
[19:33] God gives it to you amen it's yours you
[19:37] possess it if you can find the key to
[19:40] this law of faith that opens it to you
[19:42] if you are Son of God you are daughter
[19:45] of God that never leaves you it's with
[19:47] you all the time but your faith gets
[19:50] away from it but it's still there
[19:53] and I I stand here to say and that's
[19:55] what's happening even with this word
[19:56] this message that we have it's ours but
[20:00] our faith gets away from it gets away
[20:02] from is it really a Rapture does God
[20:05] really owns it all
[20:07] does he really
[20:09] my so you can see the fight that we're
[20:11] in brothers and sister we have to fight
[20:12] our way to get to where our faith can
[20:15] hold to these promises
[20:17] if not
[20:19] we already know we know what will happen
[20:21] although we're born again but we won't
[20:23] be effective
[20:25] but by the grace of God if we could hold
[20:27] on to it and our faith can grow in the
[20:30] smallest of things it will continue to
[20:32] grow so after seeing God do that in my
[20:35] life
[20:35] from Nothing by his grace
[20:39] you see it doesn't just apply to money
[20:40] my faith can anchor a little stronger
[20:42] like Lord you have these special
[20:44] promises for us Lord that we can speak
[20:46] worlds into existence
[20:48] it's not just a fable it's the truth
[20:52] we're going to seem crazy
[20:54] but we need some in our life to where we
[20:57] know hey you might think I'm crazy but I
[21:00] paid off a 40-year loan
[21:02] within 17 years it was gone
[21:06] that's crazy that's crazy
[21:10] especially coming from where I come from
[21:13] coming from both nothing
[21:15] but to see God come on the scene just to
[21:18] stand behind that faith it just
[21:21] increases your faith
[21:23] and as I shared with you the testimony
[21:25] my dad and how it's just so much because
[21:27] as you start holding on to God
[21:30] you as you start going to him for
[21:31] everything like Lord do you want me to
[21:33] use the money for this Lord this is
[21:35] another Avenue Lord what do you what
[21:37] would you have me to do and you're
[21:39] waiting on him you're fighting to wait
[21:41] you're fighting with the patience to
[21:43] wait even if you have the money you're
[21:45] like Lord would you want me to do this
[21:48] Lord you know do you want me to change a
[21:50] vehicle right now or wait a little
[21:52] longer
[21:53] you know and he'll balance those things
[21:55] out in your life each person he'll
[21:57] balance it out because he knows what
[21:58] he's expecting but we have to be in that
[22:01] spot where we're surrendered enough to
[22:02] where he can guide us through these
[22:04] things
[22:05] but again it's fighting to increase our
[22:07] faith run through some tips just to
[22:09] remember how to fight in the Book of
[22:11] Joshua let's go to the next slide
[22:13] remember you got to be strong and of
[22:15] good courage you've got to be strong and
[22:17] of good courage remember good courage is
[22:19] different from Bad courage bad courage
[22:21] would be I will apply for this credit
[22:23] card that's bad courage I will talk to
[22:25] the bank manager about the loan I'm
[22:28] gonna have the courage to do that no
[22:29] that is bad courage good courage is Lord
[22:32] I don't have the money father give me
[22:35] the strength to wait give me the
[22:37] strength be strong and very courageous
[22:39] observe and believe and do what his
[22:41] Prophet has told us all of this you can
[22:44] read in Joshua stay in the word meditate
[22:46] on it day and night remind yourself I
[22:50] Love Philip Philippians hey it says be
[22:52] anxious for nothing be anxious for
[22:55] nothing when you feel that anxiety
[22:56] coming up so Lord that word says be
[22:58] anxious for nothing but all things by
[23:00] prayer and supplication with
[23:01] Thanksgiving let your requests be known
[23:03] to God and the peace of God that passes
[23:06] understanding so keep your heart and
[23:08] Minds through Christ Jesus that
[23:10] scripture is with me all the time
[23:11] because we live in a world brothers and
[23:13] sisters where anxiety and anxiousness is
[23:15] always there believe me as we fought our
[23:18] way through you know the starter would
[23:20] go out in a car or something happens and
[23:23] you know it's like man
[23:25] it's time to buy new car instead of get
[23:26] a starter fix
[23:28] but no I'm not gonna be anxious I had
[23:30] people at the job you know and by the
[23:32] grace of the Lord he gave me a good job
[23:33] I thank him for it John when you're
[23:35] gonna get rid of that old car I'm like
[23:38] brother I don't know but it still drives
[23:41] praise the Lord it takes courage takes
[23:44] courage you walk out there you see
[23:46] everybody else with their nice cars and
[23:48] you're like I could get a nice car but
[23:49] do I need it right now or is it other
[23:52] things God you want me to do well you
[23:54] know what you know they're going to just
[23:55] have to deal with me driving this
[23:57] minivan around for a while I know they
[23:59] would probably want me to be in
[24:00] something different but you know what
[24:02] hey they're going to be happy and I do
[24:04] this this is all the time Brothers this
[24:05] is this is the fight that we're in you
[24:07] know I walk out there I'm like why am I
[24:08] feeling embarrassed walking to the van
[24:09] you know
[24:12] why am I you know I'm like they're gonna
[24:15] have to just get used to it I'm not
[24:17] trying to impress anybody but this is
[24:19] part of the fight this part of the
[24:20] struggle because I want God to leave me
[24:22] not my emotions I want him to Lead Me
[24:25] amen and that's what we have to do even
[24:27] with his word we're gonna have to stand
[24:29] there more people looking at you like
[24:31] you're crazy
[24:32] you believe that you really believe a
[24:34] Rapture and you're gonna leave the Earth
[24:36] are you sure
[24:38] well yes I do I believe
[24:41] this is personal don't be afraid
[24:44] do not be dismayed by the grace of the
[24:47] Lord Jesus let's just go on
[24:50] we're going to go to the next slide
[24:54] a couple minutes
[24:55] and as we look in the word we can see
[24:58] the tactics of the enemy right
[25:01] he has Wilds he has tricks and the word
[25:04] wow means a devious or cunning plan or
[25:08] scheme especially one used to outwit an
[25:11] opponent or achieve an end employed in
[25:14] manipulating or persuading someone to do
[25:16] what one wants the devil has been doing
[25:19] that from the very beginning my brothers
[25:21] and sisters from the very beginning he
[25:23] haven't changed that tactic if he can't
[25:25] get you one way he'll set you up and
[25:27] that's what he's doing financially
[25:28] setting us up so he can rob us of the
[25:30] resources that God wants for us to have
[25:32] that he can use for his honor and glory
[25:34] and not only that but just to get to
[25:36] that point where we have that freedom in
[25:38] our life to be led by God
[25:41] and the wonderful thing about the Lord
[25:42] Jesus he is not going to hold back he's
[25:45] going to bless you he promises that but
[25:48] we got to learn to wait on him and not
[25:50] be fooled this little picture on there
[25:52] is this little girl she's a she's a
[25:54] young girl she says your first credit
[25:55] card use it wisely and she's looking
[25:57] like she's a young lady now I know she's
[25:59] being deceived amen that's what that's
[26:01] what the devil does you start feeling
[26:03] grown when you're able to get a credit
[26:04] card again I got my first VCR on credit
[26:07] at JC Penney's I thought I was a man I
[26:10] had arrived 200 and something dollars I
[26:13] recall for a VCR on credit praising the
[26:16] Lord are the parents gonna be proud of
[26:18] me my deceived
[26:21] but by the grace of the Lord he gets us
[26:24] through all of this next slide real
[26:26] quick
[26:27] be patient got to be patient through all
[26:30] of this Aiken the the interesting thing
[26:33] about Aiken if you read this chapter it
[26:34] says it's a sad we know it's a very sad
[26:37] story cost a man his entire family
[26:39] but if you read
[26:41] in Jericho of course when he took the
[26:44] spoil and they lost men in AI
[26:47] when they went to Ai and conquered AI do
[26:50] you know God told them in that city
[26:52] after Aiken had died and gone through
[26:54] all that he told the Israelites they
[26:56] could keep the spoil in that City
[26:58] I said my head he waited one more battle
[27:02] one more battle he could have gotten the
[27:05] spoil in the other city so God has these
[27:08] things for us but he knows why he wants
[27:10] us to wait and he will bless I see it I
[27:13] believe it he will bless if we learn to
[27:17] wait on the Lord
[27:19] by his grace
[27:20] as we fight to believe let's go to
[27:25] the next slide
[27:27] keep going to the next
[27:29] be the last slide keep keep going
[27:30] through
[27:32] we'll end on this note
[27:34] the musicians can get ready next slide
[27:38] keep going
[27:42] right here you guys know the story
[27:44] remember the story brother I'm told of
[27:46] the the elderly lady and her son was a
[27:49] businessman working in India and charity
[27:51] came by and they wanted to find out why
[27:53] this woman was living in this condition
[27:55] and she was probably stricken and
[27:59] someone turned her into the authorities
[28:00] and authorities came by and they said
[28:02] you know what is do you have anybody to
[28:04] help you anybody in your family that can
[28:06] help you she said well I got a son he's
[28:08] the sweetest young young man he's been
[28:10] over there for about 10 years and he's
[28:12] just um I can't tell him I can't tell
[28:14] him I'm in this condition

[28:35] had pretty pictures on them where did
[28:37] she find them in her Bible she was rich

[28:45] all bound up you're rich
[28:48] where do you find it in the Bible you
