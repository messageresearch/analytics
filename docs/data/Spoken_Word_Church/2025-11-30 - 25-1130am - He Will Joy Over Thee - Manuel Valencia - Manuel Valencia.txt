TRANSCRIPT
========================================
words of life that you would uh impart that life to us and that you would impart all that um it is set out to be uh to accomplish. Lord God, we're thankful for your precious vindicated word, for your precious vindicated prophecy for this last age. We're thankful for rapturing faith. We're thankful, Lord God, for all the seals that have been opened. And we're thankful, Lord, that you're giving us your Bible truth revelation. In the name of Jesus Christ, bless his teaching, Lord God, for your honor and for your glory, we say. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, id like to take a text for the study here where it says we he will joy over thee. And then it says with singing. So, let's go to Zephaniah 3:17. And here's a thought for the morning. It says, "The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty. He will save. He will rejoice over thee with joy. He will rest in his love. He will joy over thee with singing. That's a thought. God will serenate over you. God will sing. And and the the the two words you want to keep in mind today is joy and singing or rejoice. The word rejoice and joy, very, you know, similar words. And the thought here is we sing unto the Lord, right? But what a thought to know is that he will joy over thee with singing. Amen. A God that receives worship that there is worship in his presence. Sometimes we kind of see him as a machine or something that's just, you know, that that that basically doesn't enter in. And it's something to look at today when we find about joy and how joy produces uh singing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we find that in the book of uh Zephaniah obviously it's a prophetic book. It's a text that was during uh written during um the reign of King Josiah. So his name means Yahweh or the Lord Jehovah has hidden or the Lord protects. And it is believed that he prophesied around the ages of 6:30 to 625 for about 5 years before Christ time. And that is uh during again King Josiah which his reign was between 640 and 609 BC King Josiah's reign. And I like to read the same text again but in this format because I think it it helps us see it a little bit better. It so talking about God who's in the midst of us that midst of thee is mighty. I I love how if you break it down this is exactly what the verse says. He will save. He will rejoice over thee with joy. He will rest in his love. What a thought, right? He he he rests so much in his love because he knows what it is. There's a trust that there's a power in there. So he would joy over thee with singing. Let that sink in. He God's going to joy over thee. And he he might have a little jig, a little song. Amen. In some places it says with dancing or with shouting and shouting out loud with the shout with the loud shout. So he will save. He will rejoice over thee with joy. He will rest in his love. He will joy over thee with singing. And then so I have a thought here. When God comes by, he does so in his presence, right? Is in the midst of thee. You know how we know that scripture that says he abides in the praises of his people, right? So divinely inspired singing is the Holy Ghost uh the Holy Spirit of God singing in you, right? The believer. Yes, the believer is praising God, but also God serenating over the believer. I don't know if you ever been down the road and all of a sudden you just &gt;&gt; I got my mind made up. You just get a little song and all that. Just don't Yeah. Don't Don't Don't underestimate that. You know, that's that's God's presence coming by. Before you know it, he might talk to you. You might pray. You might be healed. You might, you know, claim your children. It's just God God um God is a God of joy. I just wanted to take that thought and and joy will produce singing &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; singing also comes in a way of you know when you have a mourning uh when you you're mourning or when you're sad you know there's there's also that but of but but joy will produce singing &gt;&gt; so divine so I have here salvation as we know sanctification we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and glorification of course it will result in singing it you know that is God's rejoicing over you when he's doing these works of you and resting in his love and rejoicing over thee with singing. So just take back uh on that same chapter 3 and 19 through 20 just a little bit of content there and then we'll go into some other some other aspects of this thought. 19 says, "Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee. I will save her that halth, and gather her that was driven out, and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame. At that time, I will bring you again, even in the time that I gather you. For I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord. And you see, we sing, the angels sing. We find that in the scriptures. God sings. God loves singing, right? Whether it's him, the angels, or the believer. So in Luke 15:7 we have a very familiar scripture uh where it says I say unto you that likewise in the same manner joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over 90 and nine just persons which need no repentance. So in in most of the translations that word joy says that there's going to be a party in heaven or that there's going to be singing there's going to be shouting that there's going to be there there's going to be rejoicing you know over the one sinner and that's going to be the theme of the topic is in the natural we find that a father joys over his sons walking in righteousness but when they're saved but we're also going to find out how we are begotten right we're we're also we're also a children of God so we become when we're new and we're become born again of course there's going to be a rejoiceing of his heart. So we find here that there was a song of Moses and I like in I like here in Revelations 15 2-4 where it says in verse three and the song of the lamb. So they sang the song of Moses. This is the the uh what we find here and it says saying great and marvelous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of all saints who shall not fear thee oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest. I just like to take away here how the song of Moses was still sang again and then the song of the lamb. So God experiences joy himself. Just just think of that for a moment because you sometimes we we forget that you know he does experience joy. So here it is in Hebrew 12 too. looking unto Jesus, the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. In Romans 14:17, it says, "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." That's the kingdom of God. So, and in Romans 15:13, it says, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost." Amen. Galatians 5 uh 22-23 says it's a fruit, right? So the fruit of the but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy. So it's amazing to know that it's it's a fruit. It's a fruit of the Holy Ghost, right? You can only have it once you have the Holy Ghost experience. Peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. Against such there's no law. So there's really no law against joy. &gt;&gt; So if you're out there having a little bit of joy, there's no law against that. &gt;&gt; Think about it. So there's no law against joy means that you're free to have joy. It means you're free to walk in joy. It means that you're at Walmart or something and and a thought comes or the word comes by or or an inspiration comes by. There's no law that says you cannot be joyful. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Joy is not given by the world, right? Nor can it be taken away by the world like the little song goes, right? And this is Jesus speaking in John 15:11. These things I have spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full. &gt;&gt; This is God's joy, you know, and sometimes we look at it, you know, of course God gives us joy, but sometimes we see it as something that that he gives us and then, you know, goodbye, see you later. But see, he himself is joy. It's an attribute of God. It's the fruit of the Holy Spirit. Right? And joy produces singing. So Psalm 16:11 says, "Thou will show me the path of life. In thy presence is fullness of joy. At the right hand there are pleasures forever more." And the famous uh verse that we use, it's usually a small portion of the big verse that we use is for the joy of the Lord is my is your strength. It's my strength. It's our strength. Amen. And it the content there is is longer, but usually we just say that portion, right? But it is indeed that it is the joy of the Lord. You know, sometimes we just see it again. It's something he gave to you, but it's actually himself. He's a joyful God. So then that produces the believer singing for joy. It'll be a short Sunday school study this morning. So um in Psalms 135-6 it says but I have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing unto the Lord because he has dealt bountifully with me. Amen. That's the reason why we sing. And especially singing that comes out of joy in the Holy Ghost is is of course is a victory that has that it's it's an overcoming, right? It's a manifestation of an overcoming. Psalm 98:4, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord. All the earth, make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise." Amen. And it's something you cannot manufacture. You know, it has to really be the Lord doing it and giving it and giving the inspiration. Psalm 95 says, "Oh come, let us sing unto the Lord. Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. And here's an example of a psalm. So, I'll just pause here and take a break here. Psalm 100. If you don't mind flipping to it, I'm going to teach you a little psalm. All right. I don't have a tambourine here. I don't I don't know how to play instruments, but &gt;&gt; you can make a joyful noise. &gt;&gt; Really? Yeah. I don't have a good beat, though. Yeah, I'm not a musician, but I sure can make a joyful noise, and I sure could have the joy to praise him. Right. &gt;&gt; All right. Psalm 100. Just listen to this song. I learned this from some of the brothers from Arizona, the church uh Love Divine, and I think it came from the brothers from California, the original church that worked that got started there. So, this is this is straight up word. In Psalm 100, I'll start as slow as this. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye, all ye lands. Serve the Lord, the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord, he is good. It is he, he that hath made us, and not we, we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise. Be thankful unto him and bless his name, his name forever. For the Lord, the Lord is good and his mercy is everlasting and his truth end truth endureth endureth to all generations. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. And then it sings again and it goes on again. I missed that second verse, but um I love those songs, right? Because you're it's it's the it's the joy of the Lord. It's you're singing about his word. You're you're praising him. This is another that says, "This is the day. This is the day which the Lord hath made." Which the Lord hath made. We will rejoice. We will rejoice and be glad in it. And then it goes to a higher tone. Amen. Well, praise the Lord. And I just think that God's word is perfect. I love that he rejoices over thee with singing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he gives us that inspiration. In Isaiah 61:10, it says, "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord. My soul shall be joyful in my God, for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation. He hath covered me with the robe of righteousness. It's not just meaningless praise, right? As a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as the bride adornneth herself with jewels. bridegroom, you know, it's it's decking himself with ornaments and the bride adornneth herself with jewels. So, sisters, you might know that's kind of a type for you. You might know how much joy you get when you're when you're getting dressed with jewels. It says Psalm 92, I will be glad and rejoice in thee. I will sing praise to thy name, although most high. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in Psalm 119 111 the word right. So thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage. Imagine that an inheritance right forever. For they the words thy testimonies thy precepts are the rejoicing of my heart. Isn't that beautiful? Is to have the gift to be able to have that joy that comes through just the trust and knowing that God's testimonies are sure and his word is is settled forever. It's a heritage. Psalm 19:8-10. It goes, "The statues of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandments of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes." And then it goes, "More to be desired are they than gold." Yeah. Much much grow sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Amen. &gt;&gt; In nine it says, "The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever. The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous alltogether." Amen. And I encourage the the people that are inspired to sing, the people that know how to sing to to find the tunes to these songs that some psalmists have already because man, you can't go wrong by singing God's word, singing his psalms and getting under that inspiration and and just in that anointing and and and getting into the same inspiration that the psalmist had. They're pomic, you know, they're there's rhythm to it and they're even as we read them, we we rejoice even without the the singing just because it's God's poem to us. &gt;&gt; It's God serverating to you. You know, I just have a quick testimony here. in Mother's Day in Mexico, my mom um my father was out um working in another country and and so here it is mother's days and four or five in the morning before the breakup light comes a guitar to the window and here I am. I was sleeping with her. I was probably like four or five. I can barely remember this. And I just start hearing some strings. I don't know if you ever woken up to a serenade. Uh, not me personally from a from my wife playing the cello or something, but that'll be nice. But it it was special. It it stuck to me because it was like a morning serenade. You know, you musicians that God can put a song in your heart. That's that's special. That's God's coming by in his word and his singing, &gt;&gt; rejoicing over you with singing. &gt;&gt; Take that and and run with it. you know, make the write it down and write psalms and sing specials. I I just think it's beautiful and and it had such an impact on me because that song was singing to the mother, right? It was singing the and that song in Spanish. It says, "I'm singing you the morning uh songs that David would sing." So, it's it's amazing, right? Even even the musicians, right? in their in their inspiration just saying that I'm just singing you that those psalms sisters and musicians will sing and and giving thanks to you know for the attribute of being a mother boy I she was wetting her her pillow with but she was crying you know she it had an effect on her because here he is her husband's abroad Mother's Day it's a big deal in Mexico Mother's Day you know so to me it just it just uh that's a good image right there of what a morning serenade And then Proverbs 23:24 is just a last thought is how God rejoices when one soul is saved and it typifies here also a father relationship as a son we joy when our children are walking in truth. Um but we but also think about it when God rejoices and the whole point is that God has joy. It says Proverbs 23:24, "The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice, and he that beggetth a wise child shall have joy of him." It's in the natural, but also think about it in the spiritual, right? When you become born again, you've been given the wisdom of God and and you be given righteousness and you're given God's wisdom. So therefore, God rejoices. God is happy over that. In 3 John 4, we know where it says, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth." And may the Lord grant that to each and every one of us parents. &gt;&gt; May the Lord grant May we all just just see it from the children going upward though that our parents in natural joy and God who is our spiritual father rejoices. And wrapping it up here. Proverbs 23:15-16. My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart, this is him speaking, shall rejoice or a father in the proverb, right? Even mine, yep, my reigns shall rejoice when thy lips when thy lips uh speak right things. Let's take it for granted, you know, that God joys over these. So, just in summary, God in the midst of thee is mighty. God in the midst of you is mighty. He will save. He will rejoice over thee with joy. That sounds like a happy time to me. He will rest in his love. Suress. Assurance. He will joy over thee with singing. There's a Zephaniah in New American translation uh which um it's a pretty solid translation. It's not some of the newer ones. And it says, "The Lord your God is in your midst a victorious warrior. He will exalt over you with joy. He will be quiet in his love. He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy. Amen. And then Psalm 22:3, "But thou art holy, oh thou that inhabits the praises of Israel." God loves worship. God loves singing. Last quote here in the message, Broken Sisters, back in ' 64, when David said, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord. Praise him upon harps. Praise him upon the sultry. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord and praise ye the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; God rejoices. So God has joy. God rejoices in his people. That's the theme. Let them all It says let them let them of the learned say amen. When anything said right is said that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Have a good worship time and a good good preaching today. Amen. Thank you Jesus. Guys,
