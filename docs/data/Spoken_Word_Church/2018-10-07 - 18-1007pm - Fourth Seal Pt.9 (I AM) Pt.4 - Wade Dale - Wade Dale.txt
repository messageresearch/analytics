64-0816   PROVING HIS WORD   JEFFERSONVILLE IN     SUNDAY_     17
    «  221       †          Now, after nineteen hundred years, with the church ages past, and all the things that He prophesied of Luther, Wesley, we just went through and seen it drawed out, and the moon come down and drawed it out, and the Lord drawed it on the board here for us, and showed it, and come down Himself and confirmed it to be right. After nineteen hundred years, and we're at the end of the Laodicea church age, He promised, in Luke 17:30, that this same Son of man (He promised it) would be revealed in the days like it was in Sodom, upon the earth. Did He do it? Does it have to come to pass? It's impossible... Now, remember, He come in three names: the Son of man, a prophet; the Son of God, the Spirit; the Son of David, for the Millennium. But in between, this conjunction, now according to His own Words, in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed, reveal Himself as (what? not Son of God) Son of man. Will reveal Hisself in a different way.

260    "In the very day that the Son of man is revealed." Revelations 10:1 to 7, read it when you get home, "the seventh angel's Message, opening up the Seals." What is it? Not the angel is the Son of man; but the messenger is revealing the Son of man. Can you get it separated now? That's where it seems to be so hard for you, you see. Not the Son of man, Himself; but the seventh angel, the seventh messenger, is revealing to the public the Son of man, because It's left the shuck. He can't organize It. It's the Grain, Itself, again.

holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen we want to understand him today that's what it is yeah it'd be alright if you physically saw him but there's a lot of people physically sawing him after he resurrected and didn't believe who he was but if you ever have him inside you my brother Martin was talking this morning can you give me some water my water my water boy is not here Bob gone water boy is gone left me left me dry good to be in the house with Lord but yeah like brother Martin said you know it takes but yesterday was mine in June's 39th wedding anniversary so I told him I said told him downstairs I said there's one thing I'm still waiting to hear for 39 years nobody has ever asked me how I put up with her nobody but everybody asked how can she put up with me so but I'm waiting and why have I have hope that beside the point beside the ball beside the boy but yeah we'd 39 years together so all right listen I don't want to train another one that one that one's got me drained so that's good enough for me so let's turn it up close to revelations six and get started I hope you enjoying the fourth seal I thought I told somebody the other day I said I thought this was going to be about four sermons on the fourth ceiling and that was going to be it because we were just going to talk about a rapture no we still this is part 4 on I am the resurrection and we hadn't even got I am the resurrection yet so but you know I like to let get a good background and that way that we can all I know as well as you do that we don't get everything in the sermon yeah you know you get an hour and like I said you may get 15 minutes of some good information for you you know and then it might be somebody else's 15 minutes another part because you don't I wish we did I'll get it the same at the same time but we don't so like brother Gary Krantz that told me Sunday he said I seen some things that I had read right and you yeah he so we're going home there's things that we talked about Sunday that it's like we're talking about this morning the Sunday school class it all the body changed everything we needs already in the Bible there's no addition that we have to add something or even jack it up you know we don't have to you know rev it up it's already in there and the words already anointed so it's there for us those who he's justified he's already glorified I mean you really could just stop right there and your if you'd believe that if you believe that then we will go to a glorified body boo but as humans we have different avenues and different waves to get to that we have to we have to by the foolishness of preaching we have to all come to a place to where we understand our little bit and our little part like brother Martin this morning he he he was it was so funny he was talking about you know he thought that the preacher had that his girlfriend had been talking to the preacher about you know their well if you'll notice today there was somebody here that was a hadn't been here in a long time yeah a male that had been here in a long time and the same situation pretty much and there he was preaching on the same thing so man I'm telling you I was going good and yes Lord you're working you're working is if we'll just listen on our end he's always working on his then we just got to listen on our end and and make the theme manifest so let's let's go in Revelations and let's read our our fourth seal because really if we don't get this part I mean we're not going to take a rapture because the rapture happens on the for sale so we got to get this and we got to get it down right and and get it to where we can y'all got the fonts a little bit smaller on there than some of the I can't hardly read that yeah it's a little bit a little bit smaller you might want to try to fix that in a few minutes but revelation 6:1 let's bow our heads before we get started dear lord thank you for another day Lord we were taught thinking this morning what an opportunity it is to just come into a house and sit and listen to your saints talk even though just even being a minister or not a minister but just being able to converse and fellowship and have have fellowship one with another and be able to talk and even though sometimes we may talk about the things of life Lord somewhere in in that and intertwined into that conversation is you about something you've done for us this week or something we saw in the word or or something that's going on in our life that we know that you move supernaturally well that to me Lord that's that's telling me that you're right here you're doing what you said you were going to do Lord and you're doing it in human flesh father we pray that you just be with the ones that are sick Lord be with the ones that are not here be with the ones on the highways traveling by the Bob and ones that are gone off Lord we pray that you'd be with them and keep them safe bring them back Lord together with all of us here bless the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor Lord just touch each one forgive us of our sins Lord because we fail you every day but you told us that we were perfect you said that we would come to this and you made a way for it to happen Lord may we just now enter into the way and be able to get a good revelation from you today father bless us and take care of us the further man this service in Jesus name we pray amen we had opened the fourth seal that's better I've heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and behold a pale horse in him that sat on him was his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth let's go ahead and read Joel to be glad then the children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for you have given you the former rain moderately and then we've got the wheat listen that full that scripture is fulfilled we have the former rain right now in our possession just what God is talking about not a substitute we have us think about this the other day we don't it is the very rain that God is telling us about not a substitute not something coming we have the former rain hey ma'am and now we also have the Lateran moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm caterpillar pummel worm my great army was I sent among you and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that he has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading the word let me just make a comment I know we it was a good many of us at Bible study last night when we're talking about hearing the book of Job we're talking about I will restore well there's jr. man when your daddy's not here you supposed to take up his slack thank you brother that was already open Louise did you do it oh thank you I appreciate that I thought it's Louie's dinner I'm not gonna drink this stuff it's kind of hard it's kind of you know it's kind of unsettling when you can just take the top right off you wonder what they did with it anyway my home we redo these so if you get one at my house it will be like this we're a little bit cheap when it comes to that anyway so let's get back to the to the message here but last night what we're talking about them the bugs because that is a bug that's one bug locust pom worm it's just all different sections or development of that bug right but now I want to explain something to you because we say that the word was eaten down and that we say that this thing eats the leaves in the bark eat the SAP and whatever else it was right now listen folks hear me one time you can't eat god damn The Tree of Life has never looked bad okay cuz that's talking about the tree The Tree of Life has never looked bad The Tree of Life has never had to leave eat off of it it's never had to bark eat off of it but what have what are we talking about we're talking about what man has done with what God has given thereby alright with that because you can teach tree life down tree life's eternal and man you can't destroy the tree of life but you can just just destroy the effects that it has on man have you ever heard the phrase now remember this is a bug have you ever heard the phrase put a bug in his ear right I'll put a bug in his ear well that's what happened that's exactly what happened because it hearing faith comes by hearing what happened was these down through the ages these people have put a button I'm coming my preachers have put a bug into people's ear and it has eat away at what the truth is and then they eat away at the truth the truth listen we can't you can't erode the truth the truth of God is the truth it'll never lose its power it'll never lose its strength but when you put man in the mix individuals man preachers in the mix what they tell you becomes a doctrine well what did they do they put a bug in your ear and that bug started eating not at the tree it started eating at you right here this is where it eats happen that's not a physical tree that it needs it eats your thoughts and your ideas you know why I've told y'all plenty of times when y'all start a phrase with me that says I thought I know they didn't I know that it ain't coming from the good place well I thought well now we don't have us all coming but just be careful with that but that's what always got me was was that there was a bug planted in them ended people buy an idea contrary to God and it eat away at the effect it had on that person same way with me and you listen God can't honor a false doctrine he doesn't have to right I mean sure he he let's say he wings it to ignorance for people because the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism and see that was one of the bugs because that didn't come from God so that had to come from the devil but we accepted it by what they just kept preaching it kept preaching it kept preaching it if you preach something long enough to beat somebody I'll take you and go I think I see that and then see they'll go tell somebody else they'll go put that bug in somebody else's there then where does it either way it either wait here it didn't eat away the word it didn't need a way to tree of life or the God and either way what in your thoughts in your minds and your ideas meanwhile I was talking about the other day I've took the quote out we won't read it again we're brother Brown said that Eve that she fell in her in her mind first she didn't fall in them the natural act the natural act happen because of what went into the womb of her mind all right so being in the womb of our mind is where we have our problem I don't know about you but that's my problem the womb of my mind what I conceived in my brain is my problem but if we let God restore he said he would he said I will restore where's he restored he's not restoring the word this has been written the same way it was written since the 1300s I was looking back there because I wanted to see I want to bring something out later on but the word Bible really has nothing to do with religion it has nothing to do religion nothing it's actually a root word that came from I'll read it here now and won't have to read in a minute be ybl OS it was an ancient Phoenician city where Paris was exported in Paris was the first papers that they used to write the book any book and so the Bible only came into existence in the 1300s so you can't so what why are you saying that well when he says in the beginning was the word we think of this come on people we think of this it's not this this was written in the 1300s so it's not very old as far as written in a book that's why Paul couldn't say in the Bible it says no he was writing the Bible he was writing something that was put they were compiling it together but the Bible says in the beginning was the word well in the beginning was this no in the beginning was a man right in the beginning was the man so the word must always be a man right in the beginning was word Word was with God in the Word was God not this we're not going to carry these in eternity I thought we were supposed to become that I thought John eat this in Revelations 10 this thing disappeared John ate it any what it became part of John so anyway so keep that thought in mind while we go through this now go to John 12 let's read a few more of these his background at least Donnie told me he enjoyed me backgrounding so at least for me and Donnie's gonna stand here and talk to each other today okay all right they want to listen they can write okay all right yet they can enter in right okay and Jesus man the hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified now we gonna get in the son of man a little bit today barely barely I'm saying do you accept the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit now we know what had to happen the son of man had to going to the ground God in human flesh had to die resurrect to bring a restoration to a resurrection now all right so the same thing is what happened in the Dark Ages brother I'm told us that the corn of wheat went into the ground and ICEA which was right about here 600 ad in here it took a little while you know there's overlaps but by the end of this was the longest stage it was about 1500 years that bug in the air of 1500 years of teaching well when Luther come out all he can all he had was a just shall live by faith because the world had been covered by the other doctrines and the people had accepted it as truth even Luther accepted it as truth to a degree right he was a Trinitarian he was actually a Catholic right he was he came out of the Catholic George but he brought a lot of things with it but the just shall live by faith was not one that was the Word of God that God started restoring but it was a renoise or Reformation we are a bit through that but that was starting the restoration of like brother Branham preached restoration of the broad tree everybody alright with that so now let's accept the corner wheat so that had to happen there had to be a falling away there had to be a going down for there to be to me this is the way I look at it at quart of wheat went in the ground why why because of false teaching we killed Jesus Christ because of our sin our false ideas you said well it wasn't a false teaching well yeah it was yeah it was nobody believed who he was nobody my brother was preaching this morning started with 12 went to 5,000 he forgot the four thousand that he fed again then there was 400 then there were 70 and then he was seen a five hundred brethren after but when he was hanging on the cross it was one guy nobody believed his doctrine if not they would have been there trying to get him off that cross but they weren't they were scattered same way with you and I but when the Holy Ghost comes in which that's when the Holy Ghost comes and brings us back to life bring forth much fruit and that's what's happening right now I believe the fruit we're showing who we are and we're gonna have to show who we are because of this scripture don't you come back to restoration you're coming back to the fruit you're not coming back to stalks and leaves and bark you're coming to the fruit all right I'll read up to you in just a minute okay we'll read this long quote cuz I really like it well looking John 11 verse 21 we've got to finish reading these and get them get them all lined up then said mark them to Jesus Lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask him God God will give it to thee jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said in him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life what do you do he brought it from way back to he brought it right down to where he was that I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though they were he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us now this somebody's gonna believe that verse 26 and not take a physical death and then somebody will break that not break that Scripture but will fulfill that scripture because you know what it is right now it's a prophecy it's a prophecy 2,000 years ago a man stood at a grave and said that but it has not happened until it happen now see we've come to a time to where all this now can happen everything is where it's supposed to be German chocolate cake don't fall asleep in five minutes into the service please people good grief pinch yourself drink some coffee no yeah drinking some coffee grief come on everybody okay every by the way it got some smiling faces we go out start praying I'm gonna call the heart attack I'm sorry so we might have to we mount to pray for heart condition here in a minute yeah anyway let's go to the next one so now we remember death has to be destroyed that ought to make you happy a restoration of all things takes place now when I say a resurrection restoration of all things takes place I was telling the son is good class this morning you and I must realize when Jesus came out of that tomb and said I all power and heaven earth been given unto me now if we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ what point in time are you gonna start believing that all power in heaven Earth's been given unto you wait a minute he gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and he wasn't even converted hey man we'll read it in a minute Peter wasn't even converted he said Peter just by what you said I'll give you the keys to the kingdom and whatever you bind on earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth I'll loose in heaven and he never took it away he never took it see that's what the faith of the fathers see what happened was jesus knew what Peter was and what he was going to be so while he was here he went ahead and give him the keys now Peter didn't start driving the car until the day of Pentecost right because he was that the he was that the garden gets them and he cut the ears off right that wasn't the keys to the kingdom no but God but but Jesus knew that he would come to a place that he would be the one that would open the door into them into the Gentile world but a resurrection has to take place in the rapture takes place on this seal so now let's go to restoration of the broad tree for messengers of death see brother Brown brings it what we talked about last Sunday he brings him he brings it to messengers for messengers of death killed it so it had to be somebody in human flesh because remember a false doctrine can never come from God so it can't come from the Holy Ghost it has to come from an unholy ghost it has to come from a teaching right it has to come from a teaching somewhere other than God all right so it was for messengers of death killed the tree for messengers of life restored the tree and as we were talking last Sunday how is he going to restore it he's going to restore it how by for death messengers killed it the for life messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost now listen those are names for those of people those are people even Pentecost was people with the restoration of the gift the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word he saw that was seeing then you go back first thing when you say word you think of this yeah don't think that anymore because I thought the word became flesh I thought the word became flesh what was the fourth the word what the word there were four great prophets one of them Martin Luther he began to shine a lot there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Along Came Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley came to stronger than him Pentecost Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophet say excuse me but in the last day the Mount come for Elijah's to come with what the very word that restoration message is not arrest it's not a Reformation a Reformation you can add your own idea to it Martin Luther was not full restoration there was some things added to it like Father Son Holy Ghost eternal hell all those things that was added by man but God was happy with his box to just shall live by faith never I got that okay Martin Luther the word Lord came to the prophets in the evening light I mean Elijah has to come with the very word I hope we see that this message that was brought to us brother Brown said pure unadulterated pure and unadulterated so whatever is in this tent in these books and tapes it's the eternal Word of God given to me in you to restore to do what to restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God fourth line for killers took it for messengers destroyed it for messengers of death took it away in Dogma for matures messengers of righteousness restore her back again and then as we said last Sunday prophesy Son of Man now why is it in Ezekiel Ezekiel is telling us a lot about what's going on in the end time and God has come down and ceased his prophesy Son of Man because son of man is a prophet amen son of man is a prophet the son of man when he walked on the earth he was the prophet but what was he doing he was resurrecting the bones descended the skin he was resurrecting through the Son of Man because we'll get to in just a minute all right all right so let's go to now let's give them well now go to paragraph 513 let's read that what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that Christ says finally after justification has been planted you see why brother man had come back preach since they wouldn't nobody know what justification was nobody would know what it was when he said justification did go will you come up but he preached justification sure Martin Luther and John Wesley preached justification sanctification but I do not think that Martin Luther come out ever service and said I'm just supposed to preach on justification so I'm just gonna preach on justification no it was intertwined in this message but that's what the people god that's the pure unadulterated word that the people got and got born again under that that all right but you and I have come through the full circle in man every time we come to church the Holy Ghost should fall every time I own all the word that we have not just a little piece of it but all of it after justification has been planted sanctification has been sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself like that like that cap of the pyramid his point of that first line justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost then then coming of the cap what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out now that wasn't happening when he was preaching in nineteen what is that from 1962 this is now because you and I are the bunch that can be honed that bunch that he was preaching to not saying that bunch and degrading them but that bunch was not hone like you in our home because they were they were still under the Reformation part being restored but you and I have come to the full part because the sales weren't even open before by them it's only the 422 of 1962 so what is he saying the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified sanctified in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again alright is that okay but he showed the whole thing right into that coming of the capstone and I will restore sayeth the Lord all the years it just makes me feel good that this is it this is the part that God's talking about he's talking about when listen Marie God didn't God didn't write the word Pope he didn't write it down on paper he saw people and the way they acted and the word they would receive and what they would do with him when they got it it didn't say in the beginning God wrote the word yes it in the beginning was the word and the words eternal you can't write it down how can you write something down this eternal man has done just that's the best that we can do but you know what that's the best to get us out of here that's the best to get us out of here and once that gets us out of here then that message of cheer it's not another book brother branham you write a revelation chapter 23 he said sounds good he said but watch it if you add a word or take a word out say they were trying to teach said they were trying to trap me but that sounded good but we're not writing a new Bible we're already written epistles right no one in read of all men so let's go to Matthew 17 let's read this because we know the dishes were going to restore and we were talking about last Sunday and we had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man now I didn't say tell the vision to no man think about this other day Jesus is not forbidden them to tell the vision he said tell the vision do not tell the vision until the Son of Man be risen again from the dead which is right now and its disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes did a lot Smurfs first come and jesus answered then to them a life's truly shall first come and restore all things and we were talking about the last Sunday that Jesus didn't come to restore he made a way he made a way for us to come back to be restored Elisha according to what God said Elisha was to come and restore all things no we know it's the Ministry of Jesus Christ but he came to a person he came to human flesh that's what I want you to see it it's hard for us too hard for us to realize that God's going to do this whole thing through human flesh everything he's doing he's doing it through human flesh and sometimes we go well I don't know but now it's all coming through human flesh your human ears are hearing what I said your human body brought you here and tomorrow you're going to think about maybe some things that were said today and that's going to what that's gonna spark you to go to here and go to here and then to watch this and to listen to that and to mold those things over in your mind don't you just sit sometimes and think about just one quote just take one quote I do sometimes one word you take one word and you go why do you say it the way you said it that way you know you do that and then you want there comes a scripture and then there comes a quote and then there comes a sermon out of the whole thing all right so that's the way we're looking at now let's go to proving his word I like this quote right here because we must see now that we're getting into the son of man we read this quote last Sunday but we're gonna read it again premiums were 1964 cuz I want you to see that it's been taught here many times but but the son of God dispensation was back in the church was in the church ages there's a son of man dispensation that we're looking at are in right now if you want to say that's different from any time except for when he walked on the face of the earth because he just he's going to tell you write here he'll reveal yourself in a different way you ready all right now after 1900 years with the church ages past brother branham we have the church age you're not supposed to be in one anyway if you brighten but you are in the characteristic of that church all right and all the things that he prophesied of Luther Wesley we just went through and seen it drawn out and the moon come down and drawed it out and the Lord brought it out on the board here for us and showed it and come down himself and confirmed it to be right after nineteen hundred years and were at the end of the Laodicean Church age he promised in Luke 17 30 that this same son of man he promised it would be revealed in the days like it was in Sodom upon the earth did he do it does it have to come to pass it's impossible now it doesn't say it's impossible to come to pass you hear what I'm saying he's saying it's impossible for it not to come to pass and he's picking up another thought now remember he come in three names now they have to be separated because there's different times for different names remember the the syrophoenician woman said son of David have mercy on me he never paid her any attention but when she said Lord that brought his attention why she had no she had no ties to him as the son of David amen so and it's not saying we don't have ties to him as the son of God but we don't have a - of a son of David but now brother Brad was going to tell us it's not the Son of God dispensation anymore it's the son of man dispensation now and then now remember he coming three names the son of man a prophet the son of God the spirit the son of David for the Millennium but in between this conjunction which is now now according to his own words in the days when the son of man shall be revealed reveal himself is what not son of God son of man will reveal his self in a different way different God no different display yeah different revelation I'm telling you what he said he will reveal himself in a different way all right till we read it we'll talk about that in just a minute oh wow let me read this one more coat one more quote number three Northy ones at the end time in the very day that the Son of Man is revealed revelations 10 one two seven reading when you get home the seventh angels message opening up the seals now that's when the son of man he just told you that's when the Son of Man is to be revealed when the seven seals are opened up and every day of the Son of Man is revealed revelations 10 reading when you get home the seventh angels message opening up the seals that's the seventh angels message brother Dale has been covering it forever and ever and ever brother Browns message was not in the years of preparation it was not the reason when he said when Jesus spoke and said that Elijah will come and restore all things sure that's part of restoration but if he didn't preach those seals he we're looking for somebody else but he did and he opened them and they're here and they're for us what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you seek not the son of man himself but the seventh angel seventh messenger is revealing to the public the Son of Man because it's what it's left to shut so now it is in full-grain because the son of man was the grain he can't organize it it's the grain itself again so not but now look not the son of man himself so brother Branham was not the son of man we know that and we know one thing's for sure the Son of Man the flesh God will not show itself on this earth until the Millennium so it's got to be a revelation it's got to be a revelation among the people showing the same sign showing the same thing brother Branham and I wrote myself a note see remember the healing campaign was a temporary resurrection sign that was your resurrection sign that was the sign this listen nobody had ever done I was thinking this morning while brother Martin was preaching you know he gave those disciples the ability to pray for the sick cast out Devils do you read something that was left out though heal sick raise the dead cast out demons nothing about salvation told you couldn't happen they can't save him nobody Jesus Christ never saved nobody hey man not while he was on earth right he saw all the thief on the cross the thief on the cross wouldn't paradise the kingdom Jesus was preaching is when he said the least in the kingdom is greater than John that was the Holy Ghost that come in to the believers on the day of Pentecost I want us to see that that's when salvation - truly - the bride began was today at Pentecost that was what Jesus give his life for was so he could take that life and put it back into the people amen and that started the bride on the day of Pentecost started the bride the thief on the cross even Jesus he was so precise he didn't say today you'll be with me in the sixth dimension he said today you'll be with me in paradise where the other ones were from the Old Testament he was close he was read him close but he didn't he was not a child of the kingdom he was given heater imparted eternal life just like a lot of them in the Old Testament will be imparted eternal life but if you don't have the if you don't have the new birth now you're just gonna have to hope to get one please don't hope please don't hope but I told them this morning I said look we must understand what God has already said about us we were talking about judgment because I read you the scriptures and I'm gonna read it to you again that we're gonna judge the world right and I told them to do you know one thing's for sure that if you judge the world and you judge angels do you know that what happens is and I drew a line there's a mark against people all right the people that are let me explain this the people that are going to come up to the judgment bar have some kind of mark against them yeah that okay they will have something in their life a mark against them but do you know what those people standing in judgment here me people if you can't stand in at the white throne judgment and be a judge and have one mark half a mark or even a dot your pure perfect sinless bride of Jesus Christ how can you judge and have a mark against you these people are going to have a mark against them that's why they have to come to judgment there has to be a just God you may think how beautiful God is God is beautiful but he's also a judge amen he's a just God that's why he's called the justifier do you know what that word justified remember what brother Bram said about the form that we're talking about now is the real you didn't do it because remember justified is that you did something and then God forgive you or whatever mourn that you're justified not with God now that's not back here these people back here in the forum we stand at the white throne judgment we never did it even though an accuser could walk up listen to me an accuser could walk up and god forbid it say you you had a let's just say you had a soirée with a woman back when you were 16 years old and she's now Melissa and she walks up and she goes what's he doing up there right because she's in judgment she's standing in judgment she has a mark against her that that's not it but you know what God's gonna tell her God's gonna say if you would have done what they did if you would have done what they did I'd have done the same thing to you you that I did to them I have done the same thing it was your choice lady our man whatever one it was your choice to stand where you're standing they chose to take my justification they chose to take what I said and now they're covered they're not just covered they never did it hey by alright with that all right let's get to get back to our point now let's go to what do we read number yeah we read number three let's do read number four but you see how see we haven't really dug into real justification cuz I'm telling you you think about that if you're standing with the judge you can't have a mark against you you can't those who is justified he's already glorified that's my point if you take that justification that's what will change your body because you have a mark against you and it's your body your physical brain that says I can't do it right we know you came but if you let him if you let God wash that thing away cuz remember he puts it in the scene never remembers it again so he can't she's telling him something he don't know right hello I've got you quiet she's telling me or him whatever that March she's telling him he don't even know it but that's what he's gonna say he said lady if you would accepted me like they did I had to wash George away too but Christ was waived on the day of Pentecost when they came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the Pentecostal people that was up at Pentecost waiting for the blessings to come and to be waved again we realized in the last day according to Luke 1730 in the Sunday again in the day that the Esso end of man will be revealed are waved over the people now remember that dispensation was not waved over the people during the church ages hmm I just read you I just read where it says son of man son of God son of David I want to go back to that quote cuz I miss them but we'll go back to in a minute and the dates the Son of Man will be revealed or wave began over the people now who is the son of man in the beginning was the Bible no in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the Word of God by Word of God by signs by wonders we see today that in the Book of Luke here that as we just quoted from art Luke 2:17 chapter look up thank you come on oh well and the 30th verse in Malachi 4 in two different scriptures we're acquainted with that that word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive among again again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit because the Son of God is the baptism of the holy God okay Alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right among us and it's giving us life as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although topped in many places he was the firstfruits of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church he there the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church they'll have to be a sheaf waving again in the last days what there has to be a ministry to say that there is of someone coming to maturity but now the whole field can come the whole field can now come to maturity but I want ask you a question who planted the wheat we've talked about that brother ray we talked about this this is a whole field and they've come up this high without the seed getting a girl who planted the seed it didn't just happen somebody had to plant to see somebody had to put that seed in the ground hey man so keep that in your mind for just a minute will tell you who that is excuse me now number five so that's the way it is again today God is calling his elected people I like this I'm going to keep this quote right here with me everywhere I go and they are elected now he's coming somebody else and now they are elected for what for a resurrection and what kind of a sign is he showing them resurrection son because he listened healing was a temporary resurrection brother branham's showed that the resurrection could come by the signs and the wonders the son of man showed the resurrection when he student said I am the resurrection and the life Lord he had already done miracle by miracle by miracle by miracle by miracle by miracle he was showing them the sign that nobody had ever seen before sure you see this one coming up from the dead and you see this one but you don't see that many healings in the Old Testament do you know but when Jesus gets here he's like thousands that you don't even see in print that we're healed that you never know anything about because what one scripture I was reading in Matthew where they brought him to him all day he said all day and said the lame walking the sick was healed and the devils were cast out that wasn't recorded all in the Bible there was you know thousands of them but that resurrection sign and sure they were healings listened though there were healings and signs and wonders through the church ages but never in one ministry like there was in brother Branham never just in one ministry but now remember that wasn't all because there was a message hook to it remember this was debate the healing was debate on the hook what was the hook the hook was the resurrection son the hook was us getting a body change that was the hook that was hidden by the bait but you know what happened they went after the bait and never took the hook some of them didn't we see when brother Brennan passed away they all went back to the denomination well that wasn't the hook that wasn't the hook the hook was this message in its pure form what was he showing them then a delivering sign to deliver them from the bondage a sign of power that could shut to heaven and could block the skies and he's showing the power of the resurrection of his son living among them to resurrect him from this grave in graveyard that we're in to the land that he's promised to us resurrection sign calling out of spiritual Egypt and spiritual Babylon so he was showing the resurrection signed by healing the sick raising the dead but what he was doing was he was actually bringing us to a spiritual resurrection I'd rather be spirit if you're not spiritually resurrected first you're not going to have an actual resurrection except for about a thousand so years from now general resurrection and you're gonna have to stand with the mark against Jim he's talking about calling out of spiritual Egypt and spiritual Babylon and what was he doing when he was here he was trying to call them out of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the Herodians and all he was trying to call that group out everybody and watch let's read number six super Sun we've had all these things the path of abraham's royal seed but just before the destroying of the world the super sign must appear again an eternal everlasting resurrection sign that proves that the royal seat could not be killed like daniel like the rest of the prophets was they're all dead all prophets are dead all right all the prophets are dead everybody there's nothing left but us the grave couldn't hold him because the other the others conquered the gates of the enemies such as fire and lines and swords so forth they conquered that but this royal seed conquered death hell and the grave nothing could hold him why he's an everlasting super son what is a super sign the resurrection of Jesus Christ after being dead for 2,000 years still stands in the midst of us the same as he did then manifest himself in his church in human flesh he's the same yesterday today and forever human flesh human flesh human how many times now to skip to all this let's go to Jobe go over to where the job the ones we read last last week Jobe 14 verse 10 so man lies down to rise it's not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep oh that that would hide me in the grave that I would have keep me with us keep me secret until thy wrath be passed and that's how would it's to point me at that time and remember me if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change comes thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of that hence I will wait till my change come that will call and our answer how about that where's that call gonna come from yeah we'd better start looking at this a little bit different job 19 why do you persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh all that my words were now retinyl that they were printed in a book that they were graving with an iron pen and lead in the rock forever for I know that my Redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God yet in my flesh I shall see God and look how personal a revelation this job is saying I don't know if anybody else is gonna see this but whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another in other words overstaying now look this is not some kind of general resurrection no this is he's going to get one right when I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my rains be consumed within me now let's go to job 33 yea his soul draws near into the grave and his life to the destroyer if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness folks that's what's happening that's what's happening right now you're getting a message from a messenger not me but a messenger an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and said deliver him from going down to the pit I have found a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than a child he shall return to the days of his youth there's your body changed in the Old Testament the oldest book in the Bible so that would be one of the oldest revelations you know of what was written in the Bible there's a body change he shall return to the days and that's not all I've got a few more but I just want to use that one so let's go who is this son of man just for about ten minutes and then we'll start right on the son of man next Sunday scrolling on that who is this son of man members brother Branham said who is this son of man what'd he do in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God not to Bible not to written letter it's not there cuz remember let me put this the right way there's a lot of fill-in in this Bible there's a lot of fill-in there's a lot of fill-in things that were said that I guess you might not mean anything to me but you know the old war stories of this one and that one beyond but it has a meaning but remember the word made flesh was Jesus Christ so if you're born again today you're the word made flesh so your journey is not verbatim that's what I'm trying to say your journey is not verbatim in the Bible but I'll guarantee you you can look into this word and you can see your journey because the rimbor the whole Bible was given to us for an example but now remember examples can not always be reality you and I are reality we're human flesh like we were talking downstairs there's a parable well a parable is maybe about something and it has an underlying meaning but there's a person that lives through that you can have a parable of this like we're going to talk about a parable right here Matthew that's what then let's keep reading this I got ahead of myself the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him he didn't need a book he didn't need a book to write it down all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shines in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John now this John the Baptist we know that the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light brother Branham quote fits right in with that he was not the Son of man he's revealing the son of man brother Branham was revealing the Son of Man so John was what he was introducing the son of man hey listen brother Ram said he was one of the most important because he was trying to introduce something that they thought was Jehovah God way up here that nobody can see that was that was just so awesome which he was but now he had come right down into a baby and then grown up and he was looking at John he saw a God in human flesh John was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that life the was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him in the world and knew him not there was a song on radio now I really like but the song portrays one of the verses in the song says on a hill that you created you gave your life on a hill that you create God create gotten you where that dog off the hill with that he created it he knew he'd be someday still hanging on that same very hill that he created he created the tree that he hung on he created the ore and the metals to make the nails it putting in his hand he created the bush you made the thorns what a mighty God we serve amen he was in the world in the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received in not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh had to be a conversion here somewhere so that's your first birth the will of the flesh was your first birth hello he's talking about your second birth here which was born not of blood nor of the will of flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth alright now let's go to Matthew one and just bring in a little point here because that's what we're talking about last Sunday now the birth of Jesus Christ is on this was this was cuz this who is this son of man the son of man is a God is God in human flesh alright because truly when that was the point I was gonna make a minute ago when brother Branham talks about the three dispensations brother Dale used to have him on the wall around here a long time ago some of you remember he had him written on the wall he's not very good artist but we can still see what he's talking about well you had him written on the wall because the first dispensation really was a son of God the Creator God was the son of God right here then he come through the Old Testament then he became the son of man God in human flesh then he what he ascended came back as the Son of God in the seven Church ages and then come back again as the Son of Man that way all right with that because the son of god is the creator god that's what who we just talked about right there in the beginning was the word where was what garden word was god that was the son of god the creator the one who created all things can I get amen now the birth of Jesus was on this wise when is his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost maybe we were talking about last Sunday that's why Christ had to be burped had to come like that because in our second birth were not birthed by her natural father we're birthed by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost gives us in your birth amen but now the Holy Ghost gives us new birth brings what the son of God right into you to birth you into the kingdom of heaven then all right then Joseph her husband being a just man not willing to make her public examples - put it away probably but while he thought on these things behold the angel the Lord appeared on him in a dream and said Joseph now son of David fear not to take Mary thou my wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost now you're not gonna have the same foot say the same thing you and I gotta say the same thing that which is conceived in us her the bride is of the Holy Ghost amen but now watch though that's one dispensation that's the son of God dispensation you and I are in something different I just read you the quote we've got already got the baby here we've already should come to some kind of maturity and we've already got the man standing on earth mature statue a perfect man God in human flesh in a bride not a baby that doesn't say the statue of a perfect baby right that says it's not your perfect man so that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost she should bring forth the son shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins no this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth the son they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God with us God came down in human flesh there was the son of man in a little baby but that son of man grew he never said he never called himself the Son of God he called himself the Son of Man because remember the son of God cannot be resurrected son God never went down the Son of God is the eternal how can you get somebody that created the every star you look up and see tonight God created them and billions more that you can't see amen that's perfection that we can't even think about so how can we say that wasn't Jesus one guard of the River Jordan and all these you know silly things that people say but anyway the Bible says he was born bring forth the son they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted God with us there was your sight there's your son of man now we know and listen I want you to understand something back in the Old Testament he would appear put on some human flesh milk has a dick he appeared to other people in a form now that wasn't beast on a man the son of man is Jesus Christ now what Moses saw was the back part of a man brother Ram said saw theophany theophany and said he later became Jesus Christ he later became Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ is this boy we're talking about right here the one that was conceived in Mary that's the son of man that all right that is the man that's the son of man God in human flesh now let's answer a question here and then we'll then we'll stop and then I'll start on the Son of Man again next Sunday but remember I talked to you about the we talked about the field right there was something growing in the field well how did that feel get there because without somebody planting it it ain't gonna come to maturity it's not gonna come to maturity without somebody having not put something in the ground so who put it in the ground the son of God no pull up the next one Matthew 13 he had already told him the parable of the sower of the seed but he never told him who it was now he's fixing to break it now alright you're okay with this he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil we know that the harvest is in the world the reapers of the angels and we see all that now look verse 41 the Son of man shall send forth his angels because remember we're going to read it next Sunday Jesus stood one day and said the son of man can forgive sin hmm the Son of Man can you forgive sins on the earth come on that's what he said we're gonna read some of this later of the characteristics of the different things but the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and then which do iniquity catch them in the furnace so who's gonna be standing at the judgment who's who's the one with the white wig on yeah son of God it's not a man the son of man is the judge and so I don't know about that well let's go to let's go to Revelation let's get Matthew 16 I'll read it next Sunday we know that who do I say that the son of man say that I am I was in watch I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what now see us write it in a book and send it to the seven churches which in Asia Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia I'm sorry brother now I mean breath nothing brother brother Hal sorry he says I get running too fast and he can't keep up with me sorry about it I'm sorry about that one he's trying to read you got it you got to do it like the top writer you got to do this and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one locking to the Son of man what's he looking at the church ages it's God in human flesh even back then they were God in human flesh they just didn't get the revelation of it until the end time you and I get the tremenda big the big revelation because you know what we're going to be able to see it in the word they couldn't see it in the word they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and they were safe that's that's their deal all right that was their box one lakh into the Son of Man clothed with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girl so there's your bride form which is the son of man bride for him but now watch we missed one here he's had in his hair were white like wool go to Daniel 9 I'm dark Daniel 7 where the Ancient of Days comes with what with the wig wig is judgment but also what's this his head was like wool I want to snow his eyes where it's flames of fire his feet like unto fine brass what does the Bible call brass brass is always considered with joy so there's your righteous judge the Son of Man is the judge because what he come here he came here to give us an example and then he didn't just leave he come and got into you like brother Martin was saying that he got into you to live that same life and that's what the world's gonna be judged by the world the Bible you know brother the world whole world to be judged by Jesus Christ but he's he's just gonna be Jesus Christ standing there no it's gonna be the whole bride everybody's standing there with him none all right so who is this son of man in the beginning was the word in the beginning was to Genesis that's what I wrote my Bible in the beginning was a Genesis 1:26 man and the Genesis 1:26 man was with God and the Genesis 1:26 man was God and the Genesis 1:26 man was made flesh and dwelt among us a man so if you'll take it that way that's what that Genesis 1:26 man came down into human flesh one man but he didn't stop there he come back on the day of Pentecost as a hundred and twenty of those people 120 little Jesus's but they never had let stand our feet they never get ready for communion they never had though the revelation of who that man exactly was I said exactly you and I are going to pinpoint exactly who that man is because brother Brown said he'll become so visible among us to a raise the dead and go in the rapture well there's your whole key it's to bring the son of man bring the son of man visible where we can see them not not seeing with our eyes we can understand what we're doing here understand what our box is it's to get the dead out of the ground it's to preach the Word of God so alive until they'll want to come over here where we're at right now they don't want to come over here where we're at right because we haven't destroyed this but I promise you people the Bible says death will be destroyed one day we'll stand and we'll say all power in heaven earth been given unto me dead come out of the corner and we won't stand there boastful and we not gonna walk out there like Jesus said the Pharisees go out there and go I'm a fair saying I'm fixin to pray to God you know what Jesus said happened to don't you he said you go in your closet and you pray in secret and God will reward you openly we may be all at home praying one day and something struck earth and the Dead start coming among us I'm okay for it to happen in here but this would be a little easier than if we were all say if somebody was at work and they looked over and Robert Tatum walked through the wall walked through and since he because you know what they're gonna tell us they're gonna say it's time right Oh Rachel Marlowe coming he said it's time Gary Atkins said this time we've been waiting on y'all we've been waiting on y'all it's time and you know what it won't be able just a short length of time will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and then we'll take a ride let's bow our heads before we get started with with a service Lord we pray that what we said Lord has been pleasing to You Father we want our lives to fit that word so Lord as the Prophet said we read it not too long ago with the prophets said Lord just sheriff's off just take us where lambs Lord just shear us off bring us back Lord who are we supposed to be forgive us of our shortcomings and and the things we do Lord that's not pleasing to You Lord I know that we all have problems in their life but Lord as the son of man you said you came down here to seek and save those which are lost Lord not being lost in our soul but sometimes we get lost in the world we get lost in the things of family and of jobs and of different things Lord and we we get lost in that Lord just Center us back Center us back into your perfect wheel Lord we know you work in permissive will but Lord your perfect will is for us to come to a body change and that's where we're absolutely zeroed out and there is no mark against this that we come to that glorified condition Lord we're longing for that maybe as we were in Egypt as the children of Israel were in Egypt being a type the children of Israel lived several hundred years and they got really easy down in Egypt they were getting all they needed to eat they were getting all that sure they were still working but they were giving straw to make bricks and all these different things and all of a sudden the persecution started coming down their rations were cut they didn't they couldn't gather straw to make bricks which made it harder Lord then they started crying for a deliverer then they started crying for someone to come to take them out of that bondage well Lord we've lived through this thing long enough we're crying out Lord now for you to take us out of this bondage and deliver us from these things Lord just bless us now sanctifies for this journey sanctifies today Lord for this communion that's coming up Lord that will eat or drink not this body and drink this blood unworthy but Lord if there be anyone here Lord that sick may you heal them as the service continues Lord may you save the ones that are lost Lord right here in this service because we still believe we still believe in us a saving Lord right up to the end till the doors close I believe you'll give salvation to anybody that'll accept it father just be with us now in the further man this service grant these things in Jesus name Amen Lord bless you go ahead well I bout lost my voice too but we gonna get it right here let's go to Corinthians in a word fat yeah I got it somewhere I got it marked in my Bible first Corinthians 13 yep all right here we go first Corinthians 13 verse 23 for I've received of the Lord that which I have also delivered unto you this is Paul speaking because remember he wasn't at the he wasn't at the table but he's what do you received from the Lord the Lord gave him a revelation of what went on and obviously could tell it better than the rest of them or he would have told you through some our God would have told us through somebody else privacy's of the Lord that once I also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord you know he's even people in the message I hate to tell you but it says for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you just show the Lord's death till he comes well they think the Son of man came in 1963 so they don't have to take communion anymore now that's not what the Bible says that's that's carnal that's carnal impersonation that's carnal ideas on the scripture no we're going to take this until the body change and then we'll get to take it at the marriage supper and richardroberts you can drink the biggest cup of wine you want to if you want but but you can have it it's all yours wheresoever or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself all of us examine ourselves and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup so if we examine ourselves we can eat and drink a little you see in here for he is and wrinkles unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world see see brothers and sisters if you're born again today you're not judged with the world you've been taken out of that judgment there'll be no judgment of you in the world if you're born again your your ticket has been punched you you get an automatic taste of glory so why are we then pushing it that way let's have some fun with it now hey man let's don't push it that way let's have fun with it and what I mean by fun let's be being the Lord wherefore my brother when you come together eat tearing one for another whip mother says we're not condemned with the world if you're born again like I said what a glorious thing because the world has a condemnation that the Bible written that even Jesus spoke up that we can't stop George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in every place in this nation this nation turned to prophet down in 1956 she's doomed there's nothing will bring her back but see you say well I'm an American sure I'm an American amen I'm not gonna I'm not I'm gonna stand and salute the flag and all these things that's fine because I honor the nation but I'm not going to take part in her condemnation right you and I have been called out of that condemnation hey boy that ought to make you feel good wherefore my brother when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you coming out together in the condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come let's bow our heads just for a minute unless Terry property God said pray for your pastor and your pastor pray for you so let's do that that's just Lord in Jesus name Amen the Bible City took bread and blessed him or Jesus this bread has been made for one purpose and one purpose on it when we're finished with it Lord we'll take it home and burn it so it could never be used again that we'll have to make a new bread the next time we take communion and Father that shows Lord it shows that you we walk in newness of life with you every day Lord there's dying out Lord of the things that we do but Lord we don't have to die in our soul if we're born again Lord you've already give us eternal life and we're standing here in Lord taking this bread as a commemoration of the body that hung on Calvary that was broken up not in broken bones but was mashed and and all that where we didn't even know that you look like a human as the brother said today there was no skin hardly left on your body Lord you did that for me you did that for me Lord and I appreciate that and as we break this bread Lord we think of that that you dying and suffering on Calvary that by your stripes we are already healed amen by the stripes we're already healed it's not we're going to be we're already healed already healed I believe that then we have seen people take communion and be healed why because you take this right here and if you're if you'll do a little bit of study the the bread that they use in Israel it's called matzah or much so and it's a piece of bread like this on eleven but it has stripes in it about ever a couple of centimeters they put a stripe down it to commemorate the stripes that Christ took at Calvary and you know what they put it in there for some other purpose because they didn't believe Jesus Christ died on the cross so what a what a supernatural thing that God whatever machine they use they run stripes in it and it looks just like the stripes on the back they're brown and it looks like a stripe that you put on your back God's gonna have a witness he will have a witness they doesn't matter man came to nine we deny him all we want to God's gonna have a witness to Heavenly Father thank you for this wine Lord it's been through a process now that come from a grape now - Lord something that will excuse me if it it will never go bad Lord it's something that won't that will just keep getting better and better in it as the Holy Spirit a symbol that it just keeps working you can watch it in that in that pot that we put it in you can see it working and working and working well Lord that's working of the Holy Ghost in our life father's we take this communion as we eat the bread and drink this wine Lord may it absolutely heal us Lord and absolutely give us a refilling of the Holy Ghost as we take these things Lord we know they're just symbols but Lord it represents you and anything represents you I'll take father just be with us now in the form of the service in Jesus name we pray amen bi was
