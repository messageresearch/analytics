[30:57] and and i i've listened to it several
[31:00] times
[31:01] and uh i i think it's it's one of those
[31:03] things you know when when brother brian
[31:05] when he would preach sermons a lot of
[31:06] times uh
[31:08] a lot a lot of times we kind of go to
[31:10] church and we expect the sermon to be
[31:11] real uplifting and kind of tell us how
[31:13] good we are and everything
[31:15] but when brother brown would break a
[31:16] sermon down many times like this
[31:18] or things like souls in prison now
[31:20] convinced and concerned
[31:22] it's it's really to kind of get you
[31:24] thinking and get you concerned
[31:25] to inspect yourself so maybe think about
[31:28] think about that as we as we read the
[31:30] scripture and kind of get into the
[31:32] lesson here
[31:33] is is where are we at spiritually
[31:36] where are you at right in matthew
[31:38] chapter 7 verse 20 says
[31:40] or 19 says every tree that bringeth not
[31:43] forth good fruit
[31:44] is hewn down and cast into the fire
[31:46] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[31:48] them
[31:49] now that's a big question and what what
[31:50] other fruits that's
[31:52] even in the message today what that's a
[31:53] big question about what kind of fruits
[31:55] are we supposed to be looking for
[31:58] not everyone that sayeth unto me lord
[31:59] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[32:01] heaven
[32:02] but he that doeth
[32:05] amen but he that doeth the will of my
[32:09] father
[32:10] which is in heaven now how you supposed
[32:14] to know the will
[32:19] many will say to me in that day lord
[32:22] lord have we not
[32:23] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[32:25] have cast out devils
[32:27] and in thy name done many wonderful
[32:29] works and then while i profess unto them
[32:32] i never knew you
[32:33] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[32:36] you may be seated the lord has blessing
[32:38] to the reading of the word
[32:40] so i i like i said i'm really preaching
[32:42] this from the anointed ones at the end
[32:44] time but i wanted to title the sermon
[32:45] this morning
[32:46] workers of iniquity because i think you
[32:49] know that
[32:50] if you really kind of inspect the sermon
[32:52] that brother brown was talking about
[32:53] he's
[32:54] he's getting into what iniquity is and
[32:56] and kind of highlighting that that there
[32:57] are people that are working iniquity and
[32:59] they don't even really
[33:00] realize that they are workers of
[33:02] iniquity
[33:03] and and and i i think many times in the
[33:06] past
[33:06] um i preached this before that many
[33:09] times in the past when you preach
[33:11] sermons like this
[33:11] people kind of get in their head that it
[33:13] will give you this is supposed to give
[33:15] you power to point fingers at other
[33:16] people and to kind of inspect
[33:18] other people but that's not the
[33:20] intention of these kind of sermons at
[33:21] all is to inspect ourselves
[33:24] and you know i i believe that the only
[33:26] ones at the end time that sermon if you
[33:27] go back and listen to it it really
[33:29] if you begin to realize that iniquity
[33:31] has been purged from your life
[33:33] and that you are walking in the word it
[33:35] will give the bride
[33:36] the revelation power in your life to
[33:38] know that you are escaping the things of
[33:40] this world
[33:41] so it really has the word goes forth and
[33:43] it cuts and it divides and it chops and
[33:45] it does
[33:46] it does two things it can it condemns
[33:48] and it saves it sets apart it separates
[33:51] it puts people in in right where they're
[33:53] supposed to be
[33:54] so to one it might be really uh
[33:58] you know you begin to say oh me and the
[34:01] other
[34:01] maybe you you begin to build confidence
[34:04] that
[34:04] you're maybe doing like enoch walking
[34:07] with the word
[34:08] enoch walked with god and was found not
[34:10] he just kept walking
[34:11] and walking and walking until finally he
[34:14] escaped
[34:15] the bounds of the earth he walked off
[34:17] the earth
[34:19] so let's think about this now this
[34:21] scripture that we just read
[34:22] and maybe just kind of teach this a
[34:24] little bit more and just kind of just
[34:25] kind of mull over some things
[34:29] iniquity he said depart from me ye that
[34:32] work iniquity
[34:33] then i will profess unto them i never
[34:35] knew you depart from me
[34:36] ye that work iniquity so these people
[34:39] coming to the white throne judgment
[34:41] coming up they
[34:42] they thought they that they were fine
[34:44] that they were okay
[34:45] they're going to think that they're fine
[34:47] even even today in this age
[34:49] especially in this age because brother
[34:51] branham said this would be a sign of the
[34:53] end time
[34:53] that the deception would be so close
[34:56] have we not
[34:57] prophesied in thy name we've prophesied
[34:59] we've declared we preached on your
[35:00] behalf we've done all these
[35:02] things we've been in we've gone to
[35:03] church we've now
[35:05] see this is not talking about people out
[35:06] in the world living on uh
[35:08] you know living in sin these these are
[35:10] church people
[35:11] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[35:13] in thy name have cast out devils my
[35:16] goodness
[35:16] casting out devils and still jesus would
[35:19] say depart from me i never knew you
[35:22] and in thy name done many wonderful
[35:24] works
[35:25] done many wonderful works in the name of
[35:27] jesus christ that depart from me
[35:29] i never knew you what what kind of a
[35:31] person
[35:33] would that be that would work iniquity
[35:36] now you want to find out what it means
[35:38] to work iniquity first you got to find
[35:39] out what iniquity is
[35:41] and if you go to look up in the
[35:43] dictionary it says iniquity
[35:45] is unrighteousness to transgress the law
[35:48] the condition of without law either
[35:50] because
[35:51] ignorant of it or because violating it
[35:54] and brother brown said in the message
[35:55] the anointed ones at the end time he
[35:56] said what is iniquity
[35:59] ask somebody it's something that you
[36:01] know you ought to do
[36:03] and you won't do it so so let's think
[36:05] about that now let's see
[36:06] the bible is the way that we know what
[36:10] to do
[36:11] and the way that we should walk so when
[36:13] it's presented in front of you and it's
[36:15] put right in front of you
[36:16] that you should do certain things that
[36:18] you should dress a certain way
[36:20] that you should go to church that you
[36:22] should all these things
[36:23] adding on up holding down time holding
[36:26] down
[36:27] as the word becomes revealed and you
[36:28] turn your back on and walk away
[36:30] then that becomes iniquity and he said
[36:33] they know that word
[36:35] they hear it you're listening to this
[36:38] tape my that narrows it down doesn't it
[36:40] see that that brings it on down from not
[36:42] just denominational people
[36:44] but message people they're listening to
[36:46] that you're listening to this tape
[36:49] you're listening to this message you see
[36:52] the lord god say so you see him confirm
[36:55] it make it true
[36:56] and you know this just as plain as the
[36:59] sun is shining outside
[37:01] but you that'll hold on to your
[37:03] denomination hold on to those
[37:05] false things you worker
[37:08] of iniquity now maybe in this message
[37:12] this morning we'll just kind of hone
[37:13] that down because i i
[37:14] will kind of get into what a
[37:15] denomination is but you can have
[37:18] your own little denomination sitting
[37:19] there because you're still
[37:21] holding on to the past well i heard this
[37:23] this brother preached this years ago and
[37:25] i i know it's right even though it's
[37:27] contrary to the word i heard this
[37:28] so-and-so somebody when i came out of
[37:32] the denomination this is what they
[37:34] believe but
[37:35] i'm not going to let that go i'm just
[37:36] hanging on to it despite
[37:38] the truth that has been laid in front of
[37:40] you that you know is true
[37:42] that's right now now iniquity is a very
[37:45] important
[37:45] bible concept it's so important it just
[37:48] goes all
[37:49] brother brown talked about it if you
[37:50] read the mystery the first seal when he
[37:52] preached the first seal
[37:53] the mystery of iniquity was a very
[37:54] important part of part of that
[37:56] when the first seal is open it reveals
[37:58] to you that iniquity is gone
[38:00] the the writers got a bow and no errors
[38:03] he
[38:04] he can say all kinds of stuff but if
[38:06] iniquity's gone from you
[38:08] if iniquity has been purged from your
[38:10] soul and is not there anymore what can
[38:12] the devil say to you
[38:13] well you don't you got iniquity no
[38:14] because but you got to know
[38:16] you got to know it can't be just because
[38:18] the preacher tells you that iniquity's
[38:20] purged
[38:20] it's got to be because it's revealed to
[38:22] you personally
[38:24] personally to you that you know not
[38:26] because somebody's come and pat you on
[38:28] the back
[38:29] or because you sit in the message but
[38:30] because you know
[38:32] it's so important that it was it was
[38:34] mentioned in daniel's 70 weeks it's part
[38:36] of the six-fold purpose
[38:38] and i think that's uh you know if you
[38:40] really would meditate on the six-fold
[38:42] purpose and what that
[38:44] really is to the jews and how because
[38:47] it says to finish the transgression and
[38:50] to make an end of sins and to make
[38:52] reconciliation for iniquity now what was
[38:56] their iniquity they saw the truth
[38:57] presented right in front of them
[38:59] and they killed him on the cross and
[39:01] they turned around and walked it so
[39:03] there's got to be reconciliation for
[39:04] iniquity
[39:05] and brother branham said that you can't
[39:07] make reconciliations yourself
[39:10] you can't make reconciliation for
[39:12] yourself he said because reconciliation
[39:15] has already been made
[39:17] you just gotta recognize it right he
[39:19] said it's a confession that you're wrong
[39:22] and then
[39:22] come and straighten up now now see there
[39:26] you see
[39:27] the reason why so many walk in iniquity
[39:29] is because they are
[39:30] unwilling to recognize and just admit
[39:33] that they
[39:33] are wrong just to admit you're wrong
[39:37] now that's why it's going to take two
[39:38] prophets to come to israel and
[39:40] preach a word preach this message to
[39:42] them and then they will recognize as
[39:45] brother wade's been preaching on the day
[39:46] of atonement they'll recognize
[39:48] that they're wrong and that's what the
[39:50] word the preaching of the word is
[39:51] supposed to do to us
[39:52] in this hour is to open our eyes that
[39:55] we're wrong
[39:56] that we're wrong to the way that we've
[39:58] been living the wrong to the way that
[39:59] we've been doing wrong
[40:01] to the way see you you've got to hear
[40:04] the word if you close your
[40:06] eyes and ears to the word and you stay
[40:08] home and don't come to church
[40:10] or don't listen to the tapes when you're
[40:11] at home and don't spend time meditating
[40:13] then how you know what the will of god
[40:15] is how will you know what iniquity is
[40:19] so brother branham uh as you kind of
[40:21] follow through this this message he
[40:23] begins to talk about matthew chapter 24
[40:25] which is what he's really preaching on
[40:27] here in the in the sermon he said for
[40:28] there shall arise false christs
[40:31] and false prophets and shall show great
[40:33] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[40:35] were possible they shall deceive
[40:38] the very elect now that's something to
[40:41] really kind of ponder on
[40:43] why will it not deceive the very elect
[40:45] what will be the deception
[40:48] what will it look like when it's so
[40:49] close to the truth
[40:51] and i think almost sometimes it gives
[40:53] people kind of nervous frustration you
[40:55] you we know that there's going to be a
[40:56] deception come
[40:58] there's going to be something come and
[41:00] we're looking for that
[41:02] but you know the the antidote to that
[41:04] and the antidote to the deception is to
[41:06] just
[41:07] get in the word god will take care of it
[41:10] get in the word and feast on the word
[41:12] and you will not be deceived
[41:15] and he pointed out that there shall
[41:17] arise false christs and false prophets
[41:19] now a false christ
[41:21] brother pointed out that he didn't say
[41:22] false jesus
[41:24] because nobody's going to come around
[41:25] and say i'm jesus
[41:27] but to come around and say that i have
[41:29] the truth
[41:30] that is the deception and so that's why
[41:33] an anointed one is
[41:34] one with a message they're anointed
[41:37] they're anointed but their truth
[41:39] is is not in them now now let's pause
[41:42] right there and kind of think about that
[41:44] and that the reason brother branham
[41:46] brought out to us that you're made up
[41:49] kind of of a you're a threefold being
[41:52] you've got a body a spirit and a soul
[41:56] now now we want to make just kind of
[41:58] paint a picture a little bit that your
[42:00] soul is is way
[42:02] down deep under the surface of the water
[42:04] and i think i've used this illustration
[42:05] in the past
[42:06] your soul is what you can't really see
[42:09] it's way down there and it's what's
[42:10] guiding you now you we see our body
[42:13] it's got five five senses see taste feel
[42:16] here
[42:17] smell all of those things and that's how
[42:18] we interact with one another and then
[42:20] your spirit realm is how we
[42:22] we show affection to one another we
[42:23] imagine things we mem we memorize things
[42:25] we
[42:26] we think in that realm but way down
[42:29] under that
[42:30] under the current under the water is the
[42:33] thing that's really guiding you
[42:35] it's the thing that's really motivating
[42:36] you so if you're anointed on your flesh
[42:39] or in your spirit
[42:40] it feels good it gives you a sensation
[42:43] but
[42:44] if your soul is not changed if that
[42:46] thing
[42:47] down on the inside that's that that's
[42:50] really guiding you that's moving you
[42:52] from
[42:52] here to there moving you in the right
[42:54] direction if that's not changed
[42:56] your innermost being will be going in
[42:58] the wrong direction
[43:00] so you can make anointed in those realms
[43:03] but your teaching will be wrong
[43:07] that's why brother brown said the same
[43:08] holy spirit that anoints the church
[43:11] that gives them desire to save souls
[43:13] that gives them power to perform
[43:15] miracles
[43:16] it falls on the unjust the same as the
[43:19] just the very
[43:20] same spirit that same spirit is falling
[43:24] on the just and the unjust
[43:26] and brother adam said that that that is
[43:28] a sign of the end
[43:30] that in this time as we get closer to
[43:33] the end of this message he talked about
[43:35] janice and jammers and how
[43:36] as janice and jammers come on the scene
[43:39] it corresponds
[43:41] it comes on the scene parallel with the
[43:44] manifestation
[43:45] of the son of man now when the son of
[43:47] man is revealed in this last day
[43:50] then parallel to that you have a
[43:52] deception that will come on the scene
[43:54] as well this deception of false christs
[43:57] and false prophets
[43:58] something that has never been manifested
[44:00] in this way
[44:02] down through all of the seven church
[44:03] ages this deception will be
[44:06] a greater deception that has ever been
[44:09] and he said
[44:10] this is a sign of the end and he
[44:11] preached these sermons and
[44:13] gave us these truths he said so the
[44:16] elect would not be confused
[44:18] so that you would know the truth so with
[44:21] you would be able to inspect yourself
[44:23] and be able to tell whether you're right
[44:26] or not
[44:27] he said now if this sign is only to be
[44:29] known at the end time
[44:31] then it'll have to be after the opening
[44:33] of those seals see
[44:34] it's a sign of the end that would be
[44:37] when these things happens it'll be at
[44:38] the end time
[44:40] and it'll be a sign now so the elected
[44:42] will not be confused in these things you
[44:44] see it
[44:45] then it's got to be revealed exposed
[44:50] now now brother brown said what would
[44:52] make a man want to be a false teacher of
[44:55] something
[44:56] that's truth why would why would a man
[44:59] see there's the deception as people
[45:01] think that they're right
[45:04] so what would what would somebody want
[45:06] to deviate from the truth
[45:08] he said now we'll get down to the mark
[45:09] of the beast in a few minutes and you'll
[45:12] see
[45:13] it's denomination so let's let's think
[45:15] about what the nomination is for a
[45:17] second i'm gonna just take my time this
[45:19] morning i hope i hope it's not boring
[45:20] anybody or anything
[45:24] a denomination is when you take part of
[45:27] the whole
[45:28] so a denomination method just have some
[45:31] truth the baptists have a little truth
[45:33] even catholics have a little bit of
[45:34] truth
[45:35] every denomination has a part of the
[45:37] truth and brother branham said in one
[45:39] one illustration he gave it said it's
[45:42] like somebody's saying
[45:43] what kind of ice cream do you like and
[45:44] that one person would say i like
[45:46] chocolate ice cream
[45:47] in other words the truth of the
[45:48] methodists i like vanilla ice cream in
[45:51] other words maybe the truth of the
[45:52] baptist
[45:53] and everybody has a favorite ice cream
[45:56] but if you can see the whole rainbow
[45:58] it's not just a denomination here a
[46:00] little bit of truth over here a little
[46:02] bit of truth over there
[46:03] but this message of the hour was given
[46:05] to give us a complete picture of the
[46:07] entire bible the whole rainbow
[46:09] the seven color facet rainbow so that
[46:12] you don't say well well we're going to
[46:14] just major on
[46:15] on a theology and we but we don't
[46:17] believe in signs and wonders
[46:19] oh we believe in the supernatural
[46:21] working of the spirit but we don't
[46:22] really want to get into the mechanics so
[46:24] much
[46:24] or you don't you know you don't focus
[46:27] just on one thing
[46:28] but you can see the entire picture
[46:30] unfold
[46:32] and you see that's how a little people
[46:33] get kind of sometimes we get off track
[46:35] by
[46:36] by thinking that these sermons that
[46:38] brother brandon preached daniel 70 weeks
[46:40] and the statue of a perfect man and all
[46:43] these different sermons kind of fall in
[46:45] different buckets
[46:46] but they're painting one glorious
[46:48] picture a tapestry of the whole thing
[46:51] that we can see so brother braham said
[46:54] we're all born of the same spirit
[46:56] denomination is only taste it's all ice
[46:59] cream
[47:00] it's all spirit of god and you know what
[47:02] a rainbow makes a covenant
[47:04] let's stay this way brother let's see
[47:07] stacy a rainbow covenant
[47:09] but you see if you only take one of
[47:11] those little parts of the picture
[47:13] the methodist or the baptist or the
[47:16] catholic
[47:17] and you plant it in the ground it will
[47:19] produce a methodist harvest
[47:21] but if you can take the original seed
[47:24] and plant that into the ground
[47:26] it will produce an original seed doc the
[47:29] original seed back again
[47:30] that's why brother ryan said the church
[47:33] baptist will produce baptists methodists
[47:35] will produce
[47:35] methodists but the church will produce
[47:38] christ
[47:39] from the root the word from the root
[47:43] yes because it's going all the way back
[47:45] to the root that brother louise was
[47:47] bringing out wednesday the
[47:48] genesis 1 26 27 root
[47:51] because when you get the when you get
[47:53] the baptism in holy ghost in your soul
[47:55] it connects you back all the way back to
[47:58] the root
[47:59] to the original seed the original seed
[48:01] of god's thinking
[48:03] that you were going to come into the
[48:04] world one day and receive the truth
[48:07] and he would put his own life in you but
[48:09] you see that
[48:10] these two vines the true and the false
[48:12] vine
[48:13] grow up together by
[48:17] the same water
[48:23] but what's planted what's planted is
[48:25] going to come up
[48:26] and then you can tell what it is if you
[48:30] plant an orange seed when it comes up
[48:32] you can tell
[48:33] they said orange seed because of the
[48:34] fruit because of the fruit
[48:37] and by their fruits you shall know them
[48:40] by their fruits
[48:41] so the question is what is the fruit
[48:44] what is your fruit
[48:45] now a lot of people you know they kind
[48:48] of get in their own ideas
[48:50] instead of taking it back to the message
[48:52] but the message has the answer to what
[48:54] the fruit is
[48:54] right now is the fruit we know the bible
[48:56] says that the fruit is love the fruits
[48:58] of the spirit of love joy peace long
[49:00] suffering all those things
[49:01] but where does it come from it comes
[49:04] from the seed of the word planted within
[49:06] you and then when it bears forth fruit
[49:08] when it comes forth you'll be able to
[49:11] harvest
[49:12] the thing that was planted in other
[49:13] words you'll be able to harvest the
[49:15] doctrine that was planted in your soul
[49:17] you'll be able and how do you harvest it
[49:20] when you go up and talk to somebody
[49:22] maybe an old saintly grandma on her
[49:24] rocking chair on her front porch
[49:26] and you begin to ask her is there
[49:28] something that i have to do to be
[49:30] saved and she says jesus paid the price
[49:33] it's not by works it's by grace it's by
[49:36] faith grace through faith that you're
[49:39] saved and then the blood will keep you
[49:41] safe you see
[49:41] then you can you're going up to her and
[49:44] that little saintly grandma whoever it
[49:45] might be and you're picking
[49:47] fruit off of that tree because she's
[49:49] bearing forth fruit
[49:50] and what is her fruit her fruit is her
[49:52] doctrine
[49:53] because the doctrine will produce the
[49:56] thing
[50:00] that how can anybody not be excited
[50:06] the doctrine that is planted will bear
[50:09] forth
[50:10] you see if you plant the original seed
[50:13] it will come up
[50:14] and then somebody can glean the benefit
[50:17] from that
[50:19] if you plant the truth then up from that
[50:21] up from that ground up from your earth
[50:24] will come all of these virtues that
[50:26] program said are required
[50:29] virtue and knowledge and temperance
[50:32] and somebody could come up to you and
[50:34] pick from you
[50:35] the knowledge that you have of jesus
[50:37] christ
[50:38] the revelation that you have of who he
[50:41] is
[50:42] now that is how you tell the real fruit
[50:46] not because they saw a light or because
[50:49] they had a sensation or something
[50:51] now those things will follow you can't
[50:53] help
[50:54] for but signs and wonders to follow the
[50:56] word let me let me just kind of hit that
[50:58] a little bit because when the word is
[51:00] planted and it comes up signs and
[51:03] wonders
[51:03] will follow the word do you know
[51:07] if you go back and listen to the sermon
[51:08] christ the mystery god revealed which is
[51:10] a fantastic sermon i believe that's kind
[51:12] of what
[51:13] what brother dale's been hitting on in
[51:14] the morning the the revealing of this
[51:16] mystery
[51:18] well there's a there's a paragraph in
[51:20] there where brother ram said
[51:21] in the last days he's talking about the
[51:24] the palm warren king worm caterpillar
[51:26] locust ate down the word
[51:28] but in the last days all of that would
[51:30] be restored and he said
[51:32] he hit that signs and wonders would be
[51:34] restored
[51:36] so if the word is restored in this last
[51:38] day
[51:39] signs and wonders will be restored also
[51:42] so don't ever get it in your head that
[51:45] now we've got the theology so we don't
[51:47] expect
[51:48] signs and wonders anymore signs and
[51:50] wonders will be there
[51:52] and you will see it because it will be
[51:54] it might be be kind of
[51:56] only things that god only things that
[51:58] only you know about in your own personal
[52:00] life
[52:01] but god will manifest himself in in
[52:04] miraculous ways because
[52:06] it it can't help me manifest when the
[52:09] word is revealed to you
[52:11] do you know that one maybe one of the
[52:12] greatest signs of all is for a christian
[52:15] to live in this evil age
[52:17] for these virtues to be made manifest in
[52:19] their life for somebody
[52:20] a real god-called born-again child
[52:23] to manifest these virtues for these
[52:26] virtues to come out and for somebody to
[52:29] look at you and say there is
[52:30] real godliness there is somebody that
[52:33] could be schmidt in the face
[52:34] and yet would love his brother that's
[52:37] the kind of what what greater sign could
[52:39] there be than that
[52:40] but i'm not i'm not trying to make
[52:42] excuses or to polish it over you will
[52:45] see
[52:45] miracles in your life if you hold to the
[52:48] word
[52:48] the word of god will be right there in
[52:50] your home when people follow you
[52:52] when people get sick when you need god
[52:55] to come upon the scene
[52:56] because the greatest evidence that god
[52:58] is with you as you have the right
[53:00] doctrine that you have the right
[53:02] teaching down on the inside
[53:04] that you know your god
[53:08] i i really want to hit that you know i
[53:10] think just growing up in the message
[53:12] it seems like so many people get the
[53:14] thought in their head
[53:15] that the message is something that they
[53:17] can never quite
[53:18] understand it's so mysterious and things
[53:22] but you can't know what this message is
[53:24] about
[53:25] god will reveal it to you if you only
[53:28] take the time to open yourself up
[53:30] to yield yourself to him so that he can
[53:32] speak to you with that still small voice
[53:35] and what you believe will produce
[53:39] you see it matters what you believe it
[53:42] matters what you believe many times we
[53:44] come to church and we think
[53:45] you know well well i like this brother's
[53:48] preaching over here what
[53:49] what difference does it make if he's
[53:51] maybe preaching something a little bit
[53:53] off or whatever
[53:54] and we begin to think maybe that it
[53:55] doesn't matter so much
[53:57] but it matters what you believe because
[54:00] what you believe
[54:01] is the difference what you believe is
[54:03] the difference between the true and the
[54:05] false
[54:06] the true and the false will both have
[54:08] signs and wonders
[54:09] the true and the false will both have
[54:11] the miraculous worketh in their life
[54:13] but the true will know their god and
[54:16] will be known of him because he said as
[54:19] they came to the white throne judgment
[54:21] that scripture will read and depart from
[54:22] me i never knew you
[54:24] if he knows you and you know him that's
[54:27] the main thing
[54:30] so it says beware of false prophets in
[54:32] matthew chapter 7 verse 15 to 16
[54:36] but where false prophets which come to
[54:37] you in sheep's clothing
[54:40] but inwardly inwardly down in their soul
[54:44] on the outside they're white-washed
[54:47] jesus said white-washed sepulchrals
[54:49] on the outside it looks clean but on the
[54:51] inside they've got
[54:52] false teaching if you don't care if
[54:55] you'd heal somebody on sunday
[54:57] as they said to jesus i uh on the
[55:00] sabbath i mean to say
[55:01] if you yield somebody on the sabbath
[55:02] then something's wrong with you you see
[55:04] their doctrine
[55:06] was misplaced and in verse 16 it says
[55:09] you shall know them by their fruits
[55:12] do men gather grapes of thorns or figs
[55:14] of thistles
[55:15] and brother brown said what is the fruit
[55:17] the word the fruit
[55:18] for the season that's what it is they're
[55:21] teaching
[55:22] the teaching of what the teaching of the
[55:25] season
[55:26] what time is it it is man's doctrine
[55:30] denominational doctrine or god's word
[55:33] for the season
[55:34] so that's an important point too it's
[55:37] got to be
[55:38] god's word for the season we're not
[55:41] now teaching the doctrine of martin
[55:43] luther we're not teaching the doctrine
[55:45] of john wesley
[55:46] we're not teaching the doctrine of azusa
[55:48] street pentecost
[55:49] we're teaching the doctrine of the
[55:51] revealed word for this day
[55:54] the revelation of the son of man the
[55:56] opening of the seven seals
[55:57] the seven thunder mysteries and all that
[56:00] may seem very
[56:01] very mysterious to you but again god
[56:04] can reveal it to you god is able
[56:07] to reveal it to you so
[56:11] so how how do we identify false prophets
[56:15] false prophets will arise false christs
[56:18] will arise and be on the scenes
[56:20] so you identify by the teaching now
[56:23] now i want to kind of just hit a little
[56:25] bit sometimes we'll think
[56:27] that that a new a new christian come in
[56:30] a new little brother coming in or
[56:32] whatever they don't understand things
[56:34] and we'll be like that's false no that's
[56:36] not what we're talking about now we're
[56:37] talking about
[56:38] the word laid in front of you and you
[56:40] turn aside from it not
[56:41] not a young little new minister coming
[56:43] up and and just trying to begin
[56:45] preaching
[56:46] you know sometimes you begin to think
[56:47] that ministers ministers will never say
[56:50] anything wrong if that were true
[56:52] you remember the brother brown's first
[56:53] sermon the very first sermon he preached
[56:55] his pastor pulled him over to the side
[56:57] and said
[56:57] now you got everybody crying and
[56:59] everything but where's the word that you
[57:01] laid out
[57:01] everybody was crying and everything so
[57:03] brother brown's very first sermon he
[57:05] needed a little correction
[57:06] see we're all growing up to holding down
[57:09] time and just because you're awful a
[57:10] little bit
[57:11] see the the main thing is not that
[57:14] you're off
[57:15] but that you can be corrected do you
[57:17] know that's really one of the attributes
[57:19] of a real
[57:20] fivefold minister is maybe maybe they
[57:23] might be a little bit off but you go
[57:24] over and talk to them a little bit
[57:26] and say have you considered this
[57:28] scripture look at the scripture and
[57:29] they'll
[57:30] get right back in line because they want
[57:32] to be corrected
[57:34] real christian real son of god wants to
[57:36] be corrected
[57:40] so as brother brown begin to bring out
[57:43] these examples i i hope i'm not boring
[57:45] now it's it's only it's only
[57:47] the morning we haven't even got the
[57:50] turkey sandwiches and things
[57:52] hang on there with me
[57:55] brother brown began to run through these
[57:57] historical examples in the bible
[57:59] of of of comparison and one example one
[58:02] of the first examples he gave was
[58:03] was moses and balaam now now the
[58:06] difference was
[58:07] moses had he was he was bringing a
[58:09] message
[58:10] straight from scripture he had met god
[58:13] on the backside of the desert and he
[58:14] told him i
[58:15] am that i am and he moses asked him who
[58:18] are you and he began to impart to him
[58:20] a personal revelation of who he was and
[58:23] so
[58:23] moses was bringing them out based on
[58:25] that prophecy that
[58:26] that god gave to abraham back in genesis
[58:29] 15 where
[58:30] he said and he said unto abram noah
[58:31] assured you that thy seed shall be a
[58:33] stranger in the land that is not theirs
[58:35] and shall serve them
[58:36] and they shall afflict them four hundred
[58:38] years and also that nation whom they
[58:40] shall serve will i judge and afterwards
[58:42] shall they come out with great substance
[58:44] so moses was going about his doings
[58:47] by the word he had a a word prophet that
[58:50] he was relying on
[58:52] he was basing everything all of his
[58:53] actions on the word
[58:55] but balaam the other example that
[58:57] brother brown gave balaam
[58:59] fundamentally was right he had the he
[59:02] had his
[59:02] he said his prophecy was all right when
[59:04] he prophesied about israel
[59:06] his fundamentals his seven altars his
[59:08] seven clean sacrifices
[59:09] his oxes and his seven rams and all of
[59:12] his doings just like
[59:13] just like uh just like king that that
[59:16] looked like he was very religious he
[59:18] wanted to serve god he had an appetite
[59:20] for god he was
[59:21] he wanted to be there in church but yet
[59:24] when balaam's case
[59:25] in cain's case the teaching was wrong
[59:28] you see it
[59:29] again it matters what you believe what
[59:32] you believe
[59:33] is what sets apart the difference it's
[59:36] what makes the difference
[59:37] and balaam's teaching was now see moses
[59:40] teaching
[59:41] was we are set apart people we've been
[59:43] separated we're going into the promised
[59:45] land but balaam's teaching was
[59:47] it doesn't matter what you believe we're
[59:49] all the same
[59:50] do you see that deception it doesn't
[59:53] matter
[59:53] what we believe we're all the same
[59:56] brother said now the teaching of balaam
[59:59] the teaching was wrong
[1:00:00] not the prophecy the prophecy was right
[1:00:05] and even he i think it was balaam that
[1:00:07] prophesied a root shall spring out of
[1:00:09] david and all those kind of things
[1:00:10] he prophesied correctly things that we
[1:00:13] still quote
[1:00:14] in the scripture but his teaching was
[1:00:16] wrong
[1:00:17] now the teaching of balaam not the
[1:00:18] prophecy of balaam that was all right
[1:00:20] that was god how many believes that
[1:00:22] the prophecy of balaam was exactly right
[1:00:24] because he
[1:00:26] couldn't speak nothing else the
[1:00:28] anointing of god wouldn't speak nothing
[1:00:30] else and god
[1:00:31] vindicated it by proving it was the
[1:00:33] truth
[1:00:35] but it was the teaching of balaam now as
[1:00:38] brother branham was bringing out these
[1:00:40] things he said
[1:00:41] he wanted to point out that the reason
[1:00:43] he's bringing this out is so
[1:00:44] you can know what you are by examining
[1:00:48] yourself
[1:00:50] he said what just whatever you believe
[1:00:52] just sit still and listen
[1:00:54] and ask god to open your heart then
[1:00:56] you'll find out
[1:00:57] whether you're a bride a briar or a
[1:01:00] thistle
[1:01:01] or wherever you're standing
[1:01:06] and maybe maybe if i could just speak on
[1:01:09] that for a little bit
[1:01:10] examine yourself and see if you have a
[1:01:12] revelation that matches
[1:01:14] the prophet's message if you've been
[1:01:16] coming to church all of these years and
[1:01:18] you really don't me
[1:01:19] what know what the message is about
[1:01:20] maybe it's time to get serious and get
[1:01:22] concerned
[1:01:23] even though and you know just kind of
[1:01:25] growing up in the message
[1:01:27] you hear so many people point back to
[1:01:30] some kind of supernatural experience
[1:01:32] or a life i was sitting on the front
[1:01:34] porch somebody might say and i saw
[1:01:36] the pillar of fire there and therefore i
[1:01:38] know that i'm right
[1:01:39] i was sitting in my yard maybe one day
[1:01:42] praying and i felt the holy spirit come
[1:01:43] down and
[1:01:44] therefore i know that i'm right now
[1:01:46] listen on me listen to me don't don't
[1:01:48] fall asleep on me
[1:01:49] because this is this is important i
[1:01:51] don't believe that brother branham
[1:01:53] would preach this just for it to fall
[1:01:55] void and fall
[1:01:56] fall to deaf ears but you see this
[1:01:59] this is what sets you apart is your
[1:02:02] doctrine
[1:02:03] it's important to know what you believe
[1:02:06] and if you come to church and you don't
[1:02:08] know what you believe
[1:02:09] then it's time to be concerned
[1:02:12] that's what i believe that that by the
[1:02:14] confession of your mouth is how you're
[1:02:16] saved because
[1:02:17] if you can't speak it if you can't tell
[1:02:19] somebody what you believe do you really
[1:02:21] believe anything
[1:02:22] that's right do you really do you really
[1:02:24] believe what do you if somebody were to
[1:02:25] say
[1:02:26] well what do you believe about the
[1:02:27] serpent seed i don't know
[1:02:30] if somebody were to and you were to say
[1:02:32] i don't know do you what do you really
[1:02:34] believe anything about it
[1:02:35] if somebody were to say well what's the
[1:02:37] mystery of the first seal
[1:02:39] now let's get let's hone it down a
[1:02:40] little bit yeah if somebody were to ask
[1:02:42] you what do you believe the bible says
[1:02:44] to uh be ready
[1:02:45] to give a reason for the hope that lies
[1:02:46] within you be ready to explain what you
[1:02:49] believe
[1:02:50] because if you can't explain it if you
[1:02:52] can't even say
[1:02:53] even the most basic fundamental thing
[1:02:55] then do you really believe it
[1:02:57] if you can't confess it yeah bill
[1:03:00] brahman said oh you false teachers
[1:03:02] listening to these tapes
[1:03:04] all these years and seeing god confirm
[1:03:08] exactly what he said and you said in
[1:03:09] your study and know us the truth
[1:03:11] and because of your denominational
[1:03:12] differences you dispute them and tell
[1:03:14] your people they're not so
[1:03:16] so you see faith is not something that
[1:03:19] because we sit in a particular church we
[1:03:21] believe this particular way
[1:03:22] brother brown said it's not a dogmatic
[1:03:25] system
[1:03:26] it's not something that we believe just
[1:03:28] because somebody told us but it's
[1:03:30] something that god has
[1:03:31] personally revealed to you you have to
[1:03:34] have a revelation for yourself
[1:03:37] it's not just it's not enough to come to
[1:03:39] church and say well i know that my
[1:03:40] pastor has a revelation
[1:03:42] or i know that these ministers have a
[1:03:43] revelation but you
[1:03:45] yourself need to be able to speak it
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:48] i i was called to mind i just began
[1:03:50] thinking of you know that story in the
[1:03:52] bible where they came they were crossing
[1:03:53] over to the
[1:03:54] i don't remember all the details of this
[1:03:56] story but they got to the river
[1:03:58] and there was one tribe that was
[1:03:59] preventing the other tribe from crossing
[1:04:00] unless they could say
[1:04:02] the word shibboleth in just the right
[1:04:04] way and because
[1:04:06] they they because of their speaking they
[1:04:08] would drop a little syllable off of that
[1:04:09] they couldn't form their word just right
[1:04:12] they couldn't pass over you see because
[1:04:14] of their confession
[1:04:15] they could not pass over their
[1:04:17] confession was wrong you need to be able
[1:04:19] to speak it correctly
[1:04:21] you're going over based on your confess
[1:04:23] your confession of what
[1:04:24] what your revelation is and what you
[1:04:26] believe it to be
[1:04:28] right and if your confession is i don't
[1:04:30] know
[1:04:31] then it's time to be concerned
[1:04:35] another another example that brother
[1:04:36] brown gave and the clock's ticking on
[1:04:39] around so y'all just hold on with me
[1:04:41] in first kings chapter 22 was micah and
[1:04:44] zedekiah and in this story this is the
[1:04:46] story of ahab and jehoshaphat and
[1:04:49] ahab gets in his idea that that these
[1:04:52] this territory over here this blessing
[1:04:55] of israel say
[1:04:56] god has promised us this blessing and
[1:04:59] i'm the man that's going to go take it
[1:05:00] back
[1:05:01] despite the word of god telling him
[1:05:03] otherwise
[1:05:04] now micah micah the prophet was called
[1:05:07] upon the scene
[1:05:08] and and his on the other side they
[1:05:10] called zedekiah who rose up to
[1:05:12] to come against micah and micah the true
[1:05:15] word prophet
[1:05:16] was basing his prophecy on what elijah
[1:05:19] had already prophesied
[1:05:21] elijah had said in the place where dogs
[1:05:24] licked the blood of naboth shall dogs
[1:05:26] lick thy blood even thine so
[1:05:29] elijah had already prophesied that that
[1:05:32] that ahab was going to die
[1:05:34] and the logs would lick his blood and
[1:05:36] zedekiah comes on the scene and says
[1:05:38] prophesies false doctrine prophesies now
[1:05:41] the spirit was on him but he prophesied
[1:05:43] he taught false doctrine
[1:05:45] and he said no everything's going to be
[1:05:47] all right we're going to be victorious
[1:05:49] and you see brother branham points out
[1:05:51] that zedekiah's motive
[1:05:54] seemed good his motive was to take back
[1:05:57] the blessing of israel
[1:05:58] to go and take back the inheritance that
[1:06:00] land was israel's inheritance
[1:06:02] it belonged to them it seemed right but
[1:06:05] yet it was fundamentally wrong
[1:06:07] down in the doctrine
[1:06:10] and if you go back and read just kind of
[1:06:12] study on first kings chapter 22
[1:06:14] do you i hope everybody goes and studies
[1:06:17] on things
[1:06:18] you must study in your own private time
[1:06:21] you know you almost want to force people
[1:06:23] sometimes to just grab the back of their
[1:06:25] head and push it into the bible but
[1:06:27] you can't do that it's got to be
[1:06:29] something personal that you do and
[1:06:32] if something's really on the inside
[1:06:33] pulling you to the word you will do it
[1:06:36] and you'll spend time and look look into
[1:06:37] these scriptures so in first kings
[1:06:39] chapter 22
[1:06:40] you've got this scene up in heaven and
[1:06:42] the lord said who shall persuade ahab
[1:06:44] that he may go up and fall
[1:06:46] at raymond gilead and one said on this
[1:06:48] manner and another set on this manner
[1:06:50] and then a lion spirit came forth and
[1:06:52] said and in verse 23 it says now
[1:06:54] therefore behold the lord hath put a
[1:06:56] lying spirit in the mouth
[1:06:58] of all these prophets and the lord hath
[1:07:01] spoken evil concerning thee
[1:07:03] so the spirit he's he was speaking he
[1:07:06] was prophesying
[1:07:07] zedekiah was prophesying a lie
[1:07:10] and look how brother brown word said he
[1:07:11] said i saw god
[1:07:14] this is zedekiah speaking i saw god
[1:07:17] he told me to make these horns out of
[1:07:19] iron
[1:07:20] go out there and push the nations out of
[1:07:22] there for this belongs to us
[1:07:25] the others ain't got no right and
[1:07:27] brother branham said that zedekiah was
[1:07:29] an
[1:07:30] honorable man trying to give back to the
[1:07:33] church the material things that belonged
[1:07:35] to the church of course he had his eye
[1:07:37] on the material
[1:07:38] instead of the spiritual he said we own
[1:07:42] property we're a great organization
[1:07:45] join us it's all brothers and sisters
[1:07:48] and let's let's examine the things that
[1:07:50] brother branham had to say about
[1:07:52] zedekiah he said
[1:07:53] that zedekiah was the greatest man in
[1:07:56] the nation
[1:07:57] in the military and natural site he was
[1:08:00] the head
[1:08:01] prophet by the king he was the head of
[1:08:04] all the other prophets by organization
[1:08:07] he was made by his organization the head
[1:08:11] of all of them
[1:08:12] he was probably the best read he was
[1:08:15] the best educated he was more eligible
[1:08:18] for the job
[1:08:19] and he was anointed with the holy spirit
[1:08:21] for he's called a prophet
[1:08:24] and not just an ordinary prophet but a
[1:08:27] hebrew prophet
[1:08:28] do you see how the deception will be in
[1:08:31] this latter time and brother branham
[1:08:32] said the latter time
[1:08:34] is where the deception comes somebody
[1:08:38] that looks like they've got all the
[1:08:39] credentials they're part of the message
[1:08:41] they're
[1:08:42] in the movement they're they're the head
[1:08:44] that looks like
[1:08:45] they're maybe the best read they should
[1:08:47] be the one
[1:08:48] that knows what they're talking about
[1:08:50] and the question for you this morning is
[1:08:52] will you
[1:08:53] be deceived because the only way that
[1:08:56] you cannot be deceived is if you have
[1:08:59] the word the revelation
[1:09:01] the word is what makes the difference
[1:09:04] brother ram said what if what if it had
[1:09:06] been said
[1:09:08] can you find any fault in zedekiah micah
[1:09:10] no
[1:09:11] did you ever catch him in sin nope now
[1:09:14] see this is not a
[1:09:15] like a sinner that kind somebody going
[1:09:18] around
[1:09:19] to bars and honky talks and stuff this
[1:09:21] is somebody that's keeping themselves
[1:09:22] clean
[1:09:24] did you ever hear him cuss anybody no
[1:09:27] did you ever catch him drunk nope can
[1:09:30] you dispute his education
[1:09:31] nope do you believe his doctor's degree
[1:09:34] is false
[1:09:34] nope you believe his phd is all right
[1:09:38] sure by the sanhedrin council i guess
[1:09:40] it's all counsel i guess it's all right
[1:09:42] well then why don't you join with him
[1:09:46] because he's off the word you see
[1:09:49] what makes a difference is not
[1:09:51] sensations or feelings or looking back
[1:09:53] at something supernatural the difference
[1:09:56] is the word
[1:09:59] now now see
[1:10:04] brother brown said if you're a child of
[1:10:06] god you'll stay with the prophet
[1:10:08] of this bible it's the word
[1:10:12] now now see that's another thing that's
[1:10:13] confusing a little bit maybe
[1:10:16] to stay with the prophet does not mean
[1:10:18] to say i believe that god sent a prophet
[1:10:21] to stay with the prophet means to
[1:10:23] understand what the teaching of the
[1:10:25] prophet is
[1:10:26] and then you'll be able to stay with it
[1:10:29] it's not good enough just to say i don't
[1:10:31] know what the prophet
[1:10:32] taught but yet i believe that there's
[1:10:35] going to come somebody in this end time
[1:10:37] and to barely have an understanding you
[1:10:40] must have an understanding of the
[1:10:41] message
[1:10:42] because that's what makes the difference
[1:10:44] and i'ma just keep hitting that
[1:10:46] despite maybe how boring that may seem
[1:10:48] because that is what
[1:10:50] that is what will save us i believe we
[1:10:52] were listening to that message convinced
[1:10:54] to concerned on the way over here this
[1:10:55] morning and brother brown was talking
[1:10:56] about when you become convinced about
[1:10:58] the truth
[1:10:59] you become concerned for others and when
[1:11:02] i listen to this message the anointing
[1:11:04] ones at the end time
[1:11:05] it makes me concerned that's maybe why i
[1:11:08] want to lay it out
[1:11:09] so plain this morning that to turn to
[1:11:12] turn your back on and to walk away from
[1:11:14] it
[1:11:14] you just have to you just have to about
[1:11:16] fall over it yes that's right
[1:11:19] another example that brother brown gave
[1:11:20] was jeremiah and hananiah and jeremiah
[1:11:23] prophesied that that israel was going to
[1:11:25] go down into babylon for 70 years
[1:11:27] and had an eye said no it's just going
[1:11:29] to be two
[1:11:30] the lord showed me the lord himself came
[1:11:33] down and told me
[1:11:34] and jeremiah said he said go and see
[1:11:37] remember hannah and i took that that
[1:11:39] yoke that jeremiah had on the back to
[1:11:41] show that
[1:11:42] jeremiah put that yoke on his back to
[1:11:44] say go go down
[1:11:46] and be in bondage be in yoke to the king
[1:11:48] of babylon for 70 years
[1:11:50] and hannah and i took it off his back
[1:11:52] said i know better than you and and
[1:11:54] broke it in pieces i know better than
[1:11:56] you the lord
[1:11:57] the lord spoke to me and he told me
[1:11:59] something different and jeremiah said go
[1:12:01] and tell hananiah this is what the lord
[1:12:02] says you have broken a wooden yoke
[1:12:05] but in its place you will get a yoke of
[1:12:07] iron
[1:12:08] this is what the lord almighty the god
[1:12:10] of israel says i will put an iron yoke
[1:12:12] on the necks of all these nations to
[1:12:14] make them serve nebuchadnezzar king of
[1:12:16] babylon
[1:12:17] and they will serve him but on the other
[1:12:19] hand hanoni's doctrine
[1:12:21] was you're all right as long as you
[1:12:24] belong
[1:12:25] in other words it don't matter what you
[1:12:26] believe as long as you belong
[1:12:28] as long as you're israel as long as
[1:12:30] you're a good message believer you just
[1:12:32] come sit in a message church and you can
[1:12:33] put over your door
[1:12:34] message believer and hang it put a
[1:12:36] little little eagle over your door or
[1:12:38] whatever
[1:12:39] as long as you're israel that's all
[1:12:41] that's necessary
[1:12:42] i'm taking this right out of this
[1:12:44] message these are not my words
[1:12:46] he said hey brother brandon said hannah
[1:12:48] and i said don't be alarmed
[1:12:50] don't be scared but maybe maybe it's
[1:12:53] time for us to be alarmed a little bit
[1:12:56] and scared about our current predicament
[1:12:59] maybe it's checking up time to see if we
[1:13:01] really have a true revelation for this
[1:13:03] hour
[1:13:04] and and the bible says that hannah and i
[1:13:07] because he rejected the word eternity he
[1:13:09] walked in iniquity
[1:13:11] he was a worker of iniquity because he
[1:13:13] turned away from the truth it said
[1:13:14] he was dead that year you
[1:13:18] see what's so perplexing what's so
[1:13:20] confusing to so many
[1:13:22] is that the holy spirit can work in the
[1:13:25] life of a hypocrite
[1:13:27] down on the inside he will not be true
[1:13:29] but the holy spirit still doing
[1:13:31] wonders and miracles in your life and
[1:13:33] doing things supernatural like like that
[1:13:34] story that brother brown told about how
[1:13:36] he went to that first pentecostal
[1:13:37] meeting
[1:13:38] and and he by discernment was able to
[1:13:40] tell that that one man that was speaking
[1:13:42] in tongues
[1:13:43] was living with another man's wife are
[1:13:45] living with adultery
[1:13:46] and yet the other man was true you see
[1:13:49] both of them the spirit working but yet
[1:13:51] down on the inside of one of them
[1:13:54] his doctrine was incorrect because he
[1:13:56] was walking in iniquity he knew it was
[1:13:58] not right to live with another man's
[1:14:00] wife he knew it was not right to live in
[1:14:01] adultery
[1:14:02] but yeah he was walking in that way
[1:14:05] despite the truth being laid in front of
[1:14:07] him
[1:14:07] and matthew chapter 15 says ye hypocrisy
[1:14:11] well did isaiah prophesy of you saying
[1:14:13] this people draw
[1:14:14] nine to me with their mouth and honor me
[1:14:16] with their lips but their heart is far
[1:14:18] from me
[1:14:19] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:14:22] for doctrines the commandments of men
[1:14:25] teaching for doctrines their own ideas
[1:14:28] instead of what the word says
[1:14:30] because the word is what makes the
[1:14:33] difference
[1:14:35] and even jesus said in luke chapter 11
[1:14:37] he said if i by beelzebub cast out
[1:14:39] devils by whom do your sons cast them
[1:14:41] out
[1:14:42] therefore shall they be judges in other
[1:14:44] words the pharisees were casting out
[1:14:46] devils
[1:14:47] now we were watching one of those one of
[1:14:49] those new little movies that they came
[1:14:50] about about jesus
[1:14:52] and this is one thing that i disagree
[1:14:54] with because it was the chosen
[1:14:56] film and in that movie they got
[1:14:58] nicodemus coming up and he he to the
[1:15:00] to a st magdalene or somebody
[1:15:04] and he could not cast out an evil spirit
[1:15:07] and see this is contrary to what the
[1:15:09] bible says because the bible says that
[1:15:10] the pharisees
[1:15:11] were casting out spirits their sons were
[1:15:14] casting out spirits
[1:15:15] but the difference was not that one
[1:15:16] could cast out spirits and the other
[1:15:18] could not
[1:15:18] as this movie portrayed the difference
[1:15:21] is the doctrine
[1:15:23] the difference is the teaching and
[1:15:25] there's
[1:15:26] there's the deception brother branham
[1:15:29] said in hebrews chapter 2
[1:15:31] he says every christian spirit exalts
[1:15:33] jesus not only by your lips but by your
[1:15:35] life
[1:15:36] your lips can say one thing your life do
[1:15:38] another
[1:15:39] if you do that you know what it is
[1:15:41] that's hypocrisy
[1:15:42] and i'd rather face heaven as an infidel
[1:15:45] than a hypocrite
[1:15:46] i take my chance better i believe in
[1:15:48] heaven as an infidel than to be a
[1:15:50] hypocrite
[1:15:51] if you testify for jesus and say he's
[1:15:54] the savior
[1:15:54] you live like that because people is
[1:15:57] going to expect it out of you
[1:15:59] that's right you live like a christian
[1:16:01] ought to
[1:16:03] in other words i believe what he's
[1:16:05] saying and i'm not trying to interpret
[1:16:06] her nothing
[1:16:07] but make sure that the inside is right
[1:16:10] because you can say with your outside
[1:16:12] that i'm a christian i'm a message
[1:16:14] believer and all those kind of things
[1:16:15] but
[1:16:15] do the checking up to make sure that
[1:16:17] down on the inside
[1:16:18] it's not just a separate field with dead
[1:16:21] men's bones
[1:16:22] that you're not just a white washed
[1:16:24] grave with the tombstone whitewashed on
[1:16:26] the outside to make it look clean and
[1:16:28] nice on the outside
[1:16:29] but down on the inside you've got false
[1:16:33] doctrine
[1:16:36] jesus said talking about uh
[1:16:41] well let's read second timothy verse
[1:16:43] chapter 3
[1:16:44] where it says this know also that in the
[1:16:46] last days perilous
[1:16:48] times shall come and i'm really just
[1:16:50] following the path that brother ranum
[1:16:51] took
[1:16:52] as he preached the anointed ones in the
[1:16:53] end time so if you were
[1:16:55] maybe not quite grasping what i'm
[1:16:57] talking about this morning
[1:16:59] don't go listen to me over again go
[1:17:01] listen to brother branham over again
[1:17:03] and pause it and rewind and just kind of
[1:17:05] meditate on the things that he says
[1:17:07] this know also that in the last days
[1:17:09] perilous times shall come
[1:17:11] in the last days that's this day and he
[1:17:14] said
[1:17:15] brother branham explained it he gave a
[1:17:16] little explanation perilous and
[1:17:18] deceptive times
[1:17:20] deceptive times why but for men shall be
[1:17:24] lovers of their own selves covetous
[1:17:26] boasters
[1:17:26] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:17:28] and unthankful and holy without
[1:17:30] natural affection truth breakers false
[1:17:31] accusers incontinent fierce despisers of
[1:17:33] those that are good
[1:17:34] traitors hitting high-minded lovers of
[1:17:37] pleasures more than lovers of god
[1:17:39] in other words he's saying no natural
[1:17:41] love just
[1:17:42] selfish and self-centered out for their
[1:17:44] own personal gain
[1:17:46] but here's the real kicker you think
[1:17:48] he's talking about people out in the
[1:17:49] world
[1:17:50] but in verse 5 he says having a form of
[1:17:53] godliness
[1:17:54] this is church people having a form of
[1:17:57] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:18:00] from such turn away what is the power
[1:18:03] that will be denied
[1:18:04] the power is the word because the word
[1:18:08] is what will change you
[1:18:09] the word here received in the heart of a
[1:18:12] believer
[1:18:13] will call will convict you and cause you
[1:18:15] to realize that you're lost
[1:18:17] that you're not where you should be that
[1:18:18] will change you that will take you they
[1:18:20] will add these virtues
[1:18:21] the word is the power of god unto
[1:18:24] salvation amen
[1:18:27] performing miracles signs and wonders
[1:18:30] but denying the word
[1:18:32] that can change your life and then
[1:18:34] brother branham began to use this
[1:18:36] example of janice and jambers
[1:18:38] when moses went down into egypt he threw
[1:18:40] down the serpent and janice and jammers
[1:18:42] could too
[1:18:43] he did all these things that they could
[1:18:45] do ever ever ever plague he called they
[1:18:47] could do it too
[1:18:49] they could do the same thing he said any
[1:18:50] miracle that moses could do they could
[1:18:52] do
[1:18:53] keep that in mind we're coming to it
[1:18:54] after a while they can do anything the
[1:18:56] rest of them to
[1:18:58] do but they can't stay with the word
[1:19:01] they can't stay with the word in exodus
[1:19:04] chapter 7 it says then pharaoh also
[1:19:06] called the wise men and the sorcerers
[1:19:08] now
[1:19:08] the magicians of egypt they also did in
[1:19:11] like manner
[1:19:12] with their enchantments when when when
[1:19:14] moses came down and he put his serpent
[1:19:16] down
[1:19:17] they were able to do that too when he
[1:19:19] turned the water in the blood they were
[1:19:20] able to do that too when he caused frogs
[1:19:22] to come up they were able to do that too
[1:19:25] but where they were wrong was in their
[1:19:27] doctrine and and listen
[1:19:29] listen the way how brother branham
[1:19:31] explains this he said pharaoh's
[1:19:32] denomination
[1:19:34] says we have a man that can do
[1:19:37] that same thing and they did it
[1:19:40] he said pharaoh's heart was hardened to
[1:19:43] prove
[1:19:44] that moses wasn't the only one that had
[1:19:47] the word
[1:19:50] he wanted to prove that moses wasn't the
[1:19:52] only one that was right
[1:19:54] and the way that he wanted to prove it
[1:19:56] was by signs and wonders
[1:19:58] but you see that's where the deception
[1:20:00] is the truth
[1:20:01] lies in in the revelation and he said in
[1:20:05] second timothy chapter three verses
[1:20:06] eight to nine
[1:20:07] now as janice and jammers withstood
[1:20:09] moses so do these also resist the truth
[1:20:12] men of corrupt minds reprobate
[1:20:15] concerning the faith
[1:20:16] and brother abraham said reprobate means
[1:20:18] apostasy
[1:20:19] and apostasy means an act of refusing to
[1:20:22] continue to follow
[1:20:24] obey or recognize a religious faith or
[1:20:27] abandonment of a previous loyalty
[1:20:31] abandonment in other words you say i
[1:20:34] don't believe that
[1:20:35] anymore and the message one that's
[1:20:39] brother abraham said let me make that
[1:20:41] again
[1:20:41] do not disbelieve any word of god's
[1:20:44] bible
[1:20:45] just don't say yes i believe it say but
[1:20:48] no there's nothing about that you
[1:20:50] believe it
[1:20:51] you'll accept it if you lay it aside say
[1:20:54] well my church don't believe it that way
[1:20:56] then you do not believe
[1:20:58] it's god's word and you'll walk away
[1:21:00] under the same condemnation that eve
[1:21:03] went away under
[1:21:04] you separated yourself from the eternal
[1:21:07] when you had a chance to be united with
[1:21:09] him
[1:21:10] now remember that cannot be questioned
[1:21:12] because it was
[1:21:13] one word that in god's word
[1:21:17] and then then brother branham begins to
[1:21:19] go into
[1:21:20] will i find faith will i find faith
[1:21:24] when i return jesus said and brother
[1:21:26] brown said here is the question if you
[1:21:28] follow in that line in this hour
[1:21:29] hour will it be finished will i find the
[1:21:33] faith
[1:21:34] will malachi 4 be fulfilled in this time
[1:21:37] restore the faith of the children
[1:21:41] back to the faith of the fathers the
[1:21:43] original the word
[1:21:44] will i find that original faith in the
[1:21:47] end will i find
[1:21:49] somebody that's willing to accept it and
[1:21:51] believe it
[1:21:52] until it come becomes reality to them
[1:21:55] will i find faith that's why it's so
[1:21:59] important
[1:22:00] to stay with the word if you
[1:22:03] if you take one word off then it takes
[1:22:06] you down
[1:22:07] into death right that's why brother
[1:22:09] brown hits so often
[1:22:10] where is the where is the trinity in the
[1:22:12] bible it doesn't there's nowhere in the
[1:22:14] bible where it says trinity
[1:22:16] where does it say to baptizing titles
[1:22:19] where does it say that the initial
[1:22:21] evidence is speaking in tongues
[1:22:23] and let me bring it on down to a little
[1:22:24] bit hone in holding time a little bit
[1:22:26] more where does it say that being born
[1:22:28] again is
[1:22:29] just recognizing that you always had it
[1:22:31] and you just come to a realization that
[1:22:33] you always had eternal life it does not
[1:22:36] say that anywhere where does it say when
[1:22:39] you're born again that you've got
[1:22:40] everything then you don't need to grow
[1:22:42] where does it take away the growth where
[1:22:45] does it say predestination is how that
[1:22:47] god pushes you through a tube and
[1:22:49] you don't have to read your bible and
[1:22:50] you don't have to come to church that
[1:22:52] god just pushes you
[1:22:53] and he's the one doing everything like
[1:22:55] that where does it say
[1:22:57] jesus was not god when he was born where
[1:23:00] does it say that
[1:23:01] it says that he was elohim in the manger
[1:23:04] where does it say we don't need a
[1:23:06] personal revelation
[1:23:08] it doesn't say those things but listen
[1:23:10] when you begin to understand how you are
[1:23:12] positioned
[1:23:13] that the word of god is being made real
[1:23:16] in your own
[1:23:17] life see this is this
[1:23:20] is what will give us confidence this is
[1:23:22] what will give us confidence to realize
[1:23:24] for the church for the bride to realize
[1:23:26] who she is and what she's here for to
[1:23:29] realize that your iniquity has been
[1:23:31] taken away because
[1:23:33] why what will take away your iniquity
[1:23:35] the true correct
[1:23:36] doctrine the true correct doctrine
[1:23:40] of how to be baptized the name of god
[1:23:42] the godhead
[1:23:44] where god is right now where he is
[1:23:46] tabernacled
[1:23:48] all of these things the serpent seed all
[1:23:50] these things that have built up
[1:23:52] until they are building you up into the
[1:23:54] stature of a perfect man
[1:23:56] and that kind of a man will know that
[1:23:58] there is no iniquity in them
[1:24:01] because they've been honed down honed
[1:24:03] down by the word
[1:24:04] until the word is made fully manifest in
[1:24:06] that person's life
[1:24:09] i think that's why the god put a
[1:24:11] five-fold ministry do you know brother
[1:24:13] brown
[1:24:13] in this sermon said that he
[1:24:16] put the five-fold ministry in the church
[1:24:19] to keep it clean to keep it clean to
[1:24:23] make sure that people don't go off into
[1:24:26] darkness and default things and get
[1:24:28] carried away with different things
[1:24:30] don't get carried away don't be see
[1:24:32] don't look
[1:24:33] at the wrong thing as the evidence of
[1:24:36] your salvation
[1:24:37] don't look at the fact that once upon a
[1:24:39] time you had something supernatural
[1:24:41] happen just for a brief moment
[1:24:43] and that is the evidence the evidence is
[1:24:46] that your
[1:24:47] your revelation matches up with the word
[1:24:50] and that your life the works matches up
[1:24:52] with the word
[1:24:53] and that is the evidence that god has
[1:24:55] brought a change in your life
[1:25:01] i'm trying to skip over some of these
[1:25:03] because i don't want to hold you too
[1:25:04] long this morning
[1:25:06] of course we got lunch too so i can't
[1:25:08] hold you too long
[1:25:11] you've got an escape
[1:25:16] brother brown said in matthew or jesus
[1:25:18] said in matthew chapter 7 you shall
[1:25:20] know them by their fruits and so going
[1:25:23] back to matthew chapter 7 verse 22
[1:25:25] many will say to me in that day lord
[1:25:28] lord
[1:25:29] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[1:25:32] in thy name have cast out devils
[1:25:34] and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:25:36] works and then will i profess unto them
[1:25:38] i never knew you depart
[1:25:40] from ye that work iniquity so you see
[1:25:43] now what iniquity is
[1:25:46] iniquity and the message influenced
[1:25:47] brother said iniquity
[1:25:49] what is iniquity iniquity is something
[1:25:51] that you know
[1:25:53] it's wrong and still holding to it
[1:25:56] when you know your creeds are wrong and
[1:25:58] you still
[1:26:00] hold to it that's iniquity
[1:26:03] well the holy ghost fell on me he said i
[1:26:05] i don't doubt that a bit i
[1:26:08] spoke in tongues i sang in the spirit
[1:26:11] i done i don't doubt that a bit no
[1:26:13] question to that
[1:26:14] oh brother sister what kind of a
[1:26:17] condition
[1:26:18] this is a trembling time where we at
[1:26:22] this word is coming to life now and see
[1:26:24] then he goes and
[1:26:25] he begins to use some more examples and
[1:26:28] he talks about how
[1:26:29] saint martin had that there was a young
[1:26:32] monk
[1:26:34] that rose up he actually told several
[1:26:36] stories about saint martin as he was
[1:26:38] illustrated
[1:26:39] and one of these stories that he said
[1:26:40] there was a young monk that said
[1:26:42] the lord he rose up and said the lord
[1:26:44] has made me a prophet
[1:26:45] and i'm going to prove it to you he rose
[1:26:47] up there in the monastery and he said
[1:26:49] tonight the lord is going to give me a
[1:26:51] big fine robe
[1:26:52] and put it on me a white robe and set
[1:26:55] among you
[1:26:56] then all of you shall come up to me see
[1:26:58] and you'll take
[1:26:59] orders from me he said that a light was
[1:27:02] going to come on and it would reveal him
[1:27:03] sitting there
[1:27:04] in the in the white robe and and
[1:27:08] and that actually happened that actually
[1:27:11] came to pass
[1:27:13] but brother brown said as he was
[1:27:14] relating the story he said when he went
[1:27:16] and got the old dean of the college he
[1:27:18] walked up and down a little bit and said
[1:27:20] son that don't sound right
[1:27:23] he said you ever been listening to a
[1:27:25] sermon it's just like
[1:27:27] that don't sound right i don't think
[1:27:28] that's what brother brown said
[1:27:31] there's only one way here it is there's
[1:27:33] only one way for us to know it looks
[1:27:34] supernatural boy pentecost would have
[1:27:36] grabbed that root sinker line hook and
[1:27:38] everything else he said
[1:27:39] the miracle may seem all right but it
[1:27:42] don't seem right to the word
[1:27:45] and he said now we have such a person an
[1:27:47] anointed prophet by the name of martin
[1:27:50] come go up before him see my
[1:27:53] to think that the word was so manifest
[1:27:56] in
[1:27:56] martin saint martin that when this man
[1:27:59] went up
[1:28:00] with his robe and the light shining all
[1:28:02] of him
[1:28:04] it said brother ram said they grabbed
[1:28:06] him by the arm to take him before martin
[1:28:09] and the robe left him because that
[1:28:11] deception couldn't stand before the word
[1:28:14] deception can't stand before the word
[1:28:17] we've got to have a
[1:28:18] true understanding of how god will
[1:28:21] manifest himself
[1:28:22] in the bride in this last day where he
[1:28:25] will be placed
[1:28:26] and see then brother branham kind of
[1:28:27] shifts and he begins to talk about that
[1:28:29] he begins to talk about a new trinity
[1:28:33] that would come forth
[1:28:34] in revelation chapter 16. you all okay
[1:28:38] y'all hanging with me i'll be done in
[1:28:41] just a few minutes
[1:28:46] all right thank you brother luis i
[1:28:47] appreciate that encouragement
[1:28:50] and i saw three revelation chapter 16
[1:28:53] says and i saw three unclean spirits
[1:28:55] like frogs come out of the mouth of the
[1:28:56] dragon
[1:28:57] out of the mouth of the beast and out of
[1:28:58] the mouth of the false prophet for they
[1:29:00] are the spirits of devils working
[1:29:02] miracles which go forth see
[1:29:03] the spirits of devils working miracles
[1:29:06] this whole sermon he's talking about how
[1:29:09] that just because something works a
[1:29:11] miracle
[1:29:12] does not mean it's the truth and here
[1:29:14] comes these
[1:29:16] spirits of devils working miracles
[1:29:19] which go forth unto the kings of the
[1:29:20] earth and of the whole earth a whole
[1:29:22] world to gather them to gather them
[1:29:25] that's what we were talking about the
[1:29:26] god of this evil age when we were
[1:29:27] talking about that how that
[1:29:28] the devil is gathering his people to him
[1:29:31] god is gathering his people to him
[1:29:33] to gather them to the battle of that
[1:29:35] great day of god almighty
[1:29:37] and brotherhood said now see the tren
[1:29:39] the trinity of frogs came out of an old
[1:29:42] trinity
[1:29:43] give birth to a new trinity their mother
[1:29:45] what had come out of a trinity the
[1:29:47] dragon see the beast
[1:29:49] and the false prophet a trinity knew
[1:29:52] for when were these frogs come out when
[1:29:55] did it
[1:29:56] notice there was all the time but it
[1:29:57] wasn't manifested
[1:29:59] until between the sixth and the seventh
[1:30:02] vial
[1:30:03] just before the seals open to reveal it
[1:30:07] now see the trinity the original false
[1:30:09] doctrine of the trinity
[1:30:11] was a false conception of the godhead
[1:30:14] a false conception of who that man was
[1:30:18] on the shores of galilee a false
[1:30:20] conception of how
[1:30:21] all that played in how god would
[1:30:23] tabernacle himself in a man
[1:30:24] how he would appear who how god will be
[1:30:27] manifesting himself what the nature of
[1:30:29] the godhead
[1:30:29] was is it three different people or is
[1:30:32] it god just changing his form
[1:30:35] and this new trinity i believe will be
[1:30:38] will be a perversion again of how god is
[1:30:42] manifesting himself
[1:30:43] a deception to get your eye off the real
[1:30:45] thing of where god is revealing himself
[1:30:49] brother brahman said for in the message
[1:30:50] of the seventh angel the mysteries of
[1:30:52] god will be known
[1:30:53] all these trinitarian things and false
[1:30:55] baptisms and everything was to be made
[1:30:57] manifest
[1:30:58] god help us to see what's truth and not
[1:31:01] think it's
[1:31:02] somebody trying to say something to you
[1:31:05] and then he says
[1:31:06] i feel that spirit resenting that i feel
[1:31:09] that
[1:31:09] spirit resenting that i'm not speaking
[1:31:12] of myself brother
[1:31:14] he's not he's not trying to get people
[1:31:16] to look at him
[1:31:18] i'm speaking of the angel of the lord
[1:31:20] that's in the camp
[1:31:22] that's right in other words he's
[1:31:24] speaking he's trying to get people to
[1:31:26] see
[1:31:27] the correct revelation of where god is
[1:31:29] going to tabernacle himself
[1:31:31] and if you begin to look at brother
[1:31:32] branham that brother branham is the son
[1:31:35] of man you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:31:38] brother branham is now off the scene but
[1:31:40] the son of man will be christ again
[1:31:42] revealed in human flesh
[1:31:45] the deception will get you off of that
[1:31:47] unable to see
[1:31:49] exactly the truth the only way that
[1:31:50] you'll see the truth is by the word
[1:31:53] you see if you don't understand these
[1:31:55] these truths of the
[1:31:56] the son of man and the statue of a
[1:31:58] perfect man and christ the mystery of
[1:31:59] god revealed and who is this melchizedek
[1:32:02] and the unveiling of god how god will be
[1:32:04] unveiled this day then you will be
[1:32:06] caught up in the deception
[1:32:07] because you can't see the truth of how
[1:32:10] god will reveal himself
[1:32:14] it's misidentifying the present
[1:32:17] day truth that's it brother ram said in
[1:32:21] this message he said in the very day
[1:32:22] that the son of man is revealed
[1:32:24] revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get
[1:32:26] home the seventh angel's message
[1:32:29] opening up the seals what is it not the
[1:32:31] angel is the son of man
[1:32:34] but the messenger is revealing the son
[1:32:36] of man
[1:32:37] can you get it separated now there's the
[1:32:40] deception
[1:32:42] unable to separate and look at it
[1:32:43] correctly
[1:32:45] that's where it seems to be so hard for
[1:32:47] you you see
[1:32:48] not the son of man himself but the
[1:32:51] seventh angel the seventh messenger is
[1:32:53] revealing to the public
[1:32:55] the son of man because it's left the
[1:32:57] shook
[1:32:59] you see you see even in first john now
[1:33:03] hang on wait with me just for a minute
[1:33:04] in first john chapter four let's go to
[1:33:06] that real quick and then we'll close
[1:33:08] the deception the antichrist spirit will
[1:33:10] deceive you from realizing where
[1:33:13] god is that's right he said in 1st john
[1:33:16] chapter 4 verse 2
[1:33:18] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[1:33:21] spirit
[1:33:22] that confesseth that jesus christ has
[1:33:24] come in the flesh
[1:33:26] is of god is come in the flesh
[1:33:29] now that first trinity was to deceive to
[1:33:32] deceive you from who
[1:33:33] knowing who that was that came in the
[1:33:36] flesh
[1:33:37] what would this deception be in this
[1:33:39] last day to get you off from
[1:33:41] understanding where god is where he is
[1:33:44] tabernacled
[1:33:46] here every spirit that confesses that
[1:33:48] jesus christ not
[1:33:49] was come in the flesh but is coming the
[1:33:52] flesh
[1:33:53] he is come in the flesh
[1:33:56] not just because the minister's
[1:33:58] preaching it to you
[1:33:59] and therefore that makes it to you you
[1:34:02] have to have a revelation of it for your
[1:34:04] own self
[1:34:05] and the revelation comes by feasting on
[1:34:08] the word
[1:34:09] by eating the word until it is built up
[1:34:11] within you
[1:34:12] and then you will know whether or not
[1:34:14] jesus has come in the flesh
[1:34:16] is coming the flesh present tense is
[1:34:19] come in the flesh and every spirit that
[1:34:22] confesseth not that jesus christ
[1:34:25] is come in the flesh is not of god and
[1:34:28] this is that spirit of antichrist
[1:34:31] now not come not come in brother
[1:34:33] branham's flesh
[1:34:34] so much we believe that god spoke
[1:34:36] through him he said i've yielded my
[1:34:38] vessel to him
[1:34:39] he uses my lips but now that tabernacle
[1:34:42] that vessel is gone
[1:34:44] so where is he tabernacled
[1:34:48] brother brown said a false trinity was
[1:34:50] rising not in the early days
[1:34:53] wouldn't be made manifest in the early
[1:34:54] days it went right on through with it
[1:34:56] but when the seven seals become and open
[1:34:58] those mysteries and reveal
[1:35:00] them that's when the frog see after the
[1:35:02] seven seals
[1:35:04] are open then those frogs come out
[1:35:08] that's when the frogs three unclean
[1:35:10] spirits like frogs come out to manifest
[1:35:12] themselves
[1:35:13] a trinity doctrine against the truth see
[1:35:16] where it come from see where it's going
[1:35:18] back to they're all brothers anyhow same
[1:35:20] spirit
[1:35:20] same things and watch so deceiving
[1:35:23] performing miracles and these are devils
[1:35:26] that go forth to all the gods of the
[1:35:28] earth
[1:35:29] working miracles to deceive them in the
[1:35:31] last day and will succeed in doing it
[1:35:34] what did god say about that evil spirit
[1:35:36] said i'll go down and get in the mouth
[1:35:38] of those prophets and cause them to
[1:35:39] prophesy a lie
[1:35:41] to cause ahab to come out there to be
[1:35:43] destroyed and god said
[1:35:44] go you will succeed you will get them to
[1:35:48] believe it
[1:35:49] they're not on that word to begin with
[1:35:52] if you're not on that word you will be
[1:35:54] deceived and what is the deception the
[1:35:57] the real word is over there you got to
[1:35:59] go over the geographical good go to that
[1:36:01] location and then you can get it
[1:36:03] the bible says if if they say go over
[1:36:05] here over there don't believe it because
[1:36:07] why the word is neither ye in thy mouth
[1:36:09] if the word is in you
[1:36:11] you don't have to go to any particular
[1:36:13] geographic location to get it it's
[1:36:15] right there with you because god is
[1:36:18] revealing himself to you
[1:36:19] personally and he said again you might
[1:36:22] have thought today that i was
[1:36:24] trying to say that about myself it's not
[1:36:26] about himself
[1:36:28] he's trying to get you to see the
[1:36:30] revelation of the message
[1:36:32] to you personally being that i was
[1:36:35] packing this message i have no more to
[1:36:37] do
[1:36:38] with it than nothing no more than just a
[1:36:40] voice
[1:36:41] and my voice even against my better
[1:36:43] judgment i wanted to be a trapper
[1:36:45] but it's the will of my father that i
[1:36:47] declare to do
[1:36:48] and determined to do i wasn't the one
[1:36:51] that appeared
[1:36:52] down on the river i was only standing
[1:36:54] there when he appeared
[1:36:56] i'm not the one that performs these
[1:36:57] things and foretells these things that
[1:36:59] happens as perfect as they are
[1:37:01] i'm only one that's near when he does it
[1:37:03] i was only a voice that he used to say
[1:37:06] it
[1:37:06] it wasn't what i knew it's what i just
[1:37:08] surrendered myself to
[1:37:10] that he spoke through and you see the
[1:37:12] treacherous
[1:37:13] how treacherous this is to preach that
[1:37:16] we
[1:37:17] when you begin to get your eye off of
[1:37:19] the man
[1:37:21] and look at the message that he was
[1:37:22] preaching and allow that message to come
[1:37:25] become part of you
[1:37:27] and receive that message that you're not
[1:37:30] looking at that man
[1:37:32] as the son of man you're not looking at
[1:37:34] that man as the fulfillment of
[1:37:36] of the scripture that you are supposed
[1:37:38] to fulfill but you're looking at that
[1:37:40] the one that has come that is on the
[1:37:42] scene
[1:37:44] that's why he kept majoring on preaching
[1:37:46] hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is the
[1:37:49] same yesterday today and forever
[1:37:51] that same one that was he with him is
[1:37:54] now
[1:37:55] still on the scene with the church that
[1:37:58] same one that he was preaching about
[1:37:59] that he said
[1:38:00] i have no more to do with it with
[1:38:02] nothing that same one is still here in
[1:38:05] the church today
[1:38:07] and he's identified not so much by
[1:38:09] sensations
[1:38:10] or by signs and wonders but by a true
[1:38:13] doctrine a true revelation of who he is
[1:38:17] and who he is in the church today and
[1:38:20] where he is how he is being
[1:38:21] tabernacled and you and i christ in us
[1:38:24] the hope of glory the musicians can go
[1:38:27] ahead and come on
[1:38:28] we are doing that brother brown said
[1:38:30] three things to say before we close as
[1:38:32] the musicians come
[1:38:33] he said the world is in a solemn
[1:38:35] condition that's the unbeliever
[1:38:38] it's in that hour that janus and jambers
[1:38:41] appear the make-believer the deceivers
[1:38:43] it's in that same hour
[1:38:45] that the son of man is to be revealed
[1:38:48] the true
[1:38:49] believer there do you see how he
[1:38:51] categorized the son of man with the true
[1:38:54] believer he said that that's his words
[1:38:56] not mine
[1:38:57] the son of man categorized with the true
[1:39:00] believer
[1:39:01] and in this hour these three groups of
[1:39:03] people
[1:39:04] are being pulled into their own separate
[1:39:06] groups
[1:39:10] this this is such a great time to live
[1:39:12] in the same hour
