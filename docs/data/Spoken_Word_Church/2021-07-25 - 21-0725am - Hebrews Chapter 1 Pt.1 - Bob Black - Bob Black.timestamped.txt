[0:02] all right if the brothers could pull up
[0:03] in the back
[0:04] uh hebrews chapter one
[0:08] i was kind of looking for a topic to
[0:11] talk about
[0:11] and uh hebrews as a good weighty
[0:16] subject to kind of go through and has
[0:18] got a lot of things packed in here
[0:20] so um maybe like yeah i think one of
[0:25] jesus's parables was talking about the
[0:27] how the bible is like a
[0:29] scribe's got a treasure box and you can
[0:32] pull out things in your treasure box and
[0:33] just kind of start unpacking things so
[0:36] um
[0:37] this morning maybe we'll look into the
[0:38] treasure box and just pull things out
[0:40] and go through
[0:42] i'm going to be careful with the time
[0:45] and wave at me if i
[0:48] all right so
[0:52] you know brother branham i was i was
[0:53] reading through the he preached several
[0:55] sermons on hebrews and i was reading to
[0:57] uh the first one um where he kind of
[1:00] outlined
[1:01] kind of kind of gave a good background
[1:02] on hebrews and he talked about
[1:05] uh you know that paul was the writer of
[1:08] the book of hebrews and a lot of people
[1:10] don't know if he wrote it or not and and
[1:13] uh because it was so grammarized
[1:15] and you know there's a lot of
[1:16] comparisons between
[1:18] the life of the things that paul wrote
[1:21] and the things that he did how he
[1:23] he uh wrote many things that they could
[1:26] read about
[1:27] in the early church and at the all the a
[1:30] good
[1:30] chunk of the new testament and then
[1:32] brother branham preached
[1:34] and we can read and and you there's a
[1:36] lot of comparisons between those two and
[1:38] and um the the first church age in the
[1:41] in
[1:41] this last church age and i think it's
[1:44] interesting that
[1:45] you know brother branham i had the the
[1:47] church age book which was grammarized
[1:49] and
[1:49] kind of polished up and that's one of
[1:51] the the things with the heat book of
[1:53] hebrews it was
[1:54] it was a polished kind of form of greek
[1:57] and that's one of the way the reasons
[1:58] why people say well i don't know if
[2:00] who the author was it doesn't seem like
[2:02] it's quite written the way that some of
[2:04] the other things that paul wrote
[2:05] because it's polished up it's
[2:07] grammarized but we know that
[2:09] that thank god for a prophet we know
[2:12] that that
[2:13] paul was the author of it so
[2:17] in the book of hebrews brother branham
[2:19] said it's paul's
[2:20] key letter and he was trying to show the
[2:22] hebrews
[2:23] separating the old testament and showing
[2:25] that the old testament
[2:27] was a shadow or type of the new it's a
[2:29] shadow it's kind of like
[2:30] you know look look here look at what
[2:32] that is and then we look over here and
[2:34] see what this is and
[2:35] the old testament you can they had the
[2:37] law and
[2:38] and lay down all the things kind of like
[2:40] it got you in prison
[2:42] and so paul's showing now you're in
[2:44] prison you need a way out of prison
[2:46] and he's and he's he's kind of showing
[2:48] the difference between you you got in
[2:50] prison you're like behind prison bars
[2:52] you've broken the law you you've you've
[2:55] made a mistake
[2:56] and now you're in prison and so then he
[2:59] begins to show he begins to open up
[3:01] here's the way out of prison and begins
[3:03] to point the way to jesus christ
[3:05] and he lays out that framework of now
[3:08] i'm going to show you who jesus
[3:09] is and and why he's greater than in
[3:12] in in the first chapter why he's greater
[3:14] than all the angels
[3:16] all the prophets all the ministers that
[3:19] have spoken this man
[3:21] is greater than all of those things that
[3:23] maybe you think you have an
[3:24] understanding of
[3:25] the hebrews that he's talking to you by
[3:28] by your
[3:28] understanding of the the things that
[3:30] you've studied
[3:32] now he said the the law was a type of
[3:34] the grace
[3:35] but law had no saving power in it the
[3:38] law was a policeman
[3:40] the policeman put you in jail but you
[3:44] see it taking grace
[3:46] to get you out of jail amen now
[3:50] you know brother branham when he when he
[3:52] outlined we'll get the description just
[3:53] a second but
[3:54] just to put some background he was given
[3:57] some perspective on
[3:58] on paul was saved and then he went off
[4:01] for a long time to three years or so to
[4:04] study and
[4:05] and and brother brown said he came out
[4:06] of that that period of study
[4:09] realizing that the church needs to be
[4:11] balanced
[4:12] and he said this book of hebrews was was
[4:15] really to kind of establish
[4:16] balance and the the reason why we need
[4:19] balance and and he's outlines this in
[4:21] the in that message that he preached on
[4:23] hebrews
[4:24] he said now on this side when people get
[4:27] converted their minds is sit right on
[4:29] christ
[4:30] and if they're just a little scholarly
[4:32] and don't keep under prayer
[4:33] they'll get real cold and stiff and
[4:35] starchy and indifferent
[4:37] and then if they're just a little bit
[4:39] nervous if you don't watch they'll just
[4:41] get radical
[4:42] and wild on this side seat they go into
[4:45] sensations and everything
[4:47] so there's the two complex the two
[4:50] extremes
[4:50] to get real cold and starchy or to get
[4:53] real wild and fanatical
[4:55] he said but now but the real church is a
[4:57] real sane gospel
[4:59] right in the middle of the road it's not
[5:02] cold and starchy
[5:03] neither is it fanaticism it's a real
[5:07] good old warm gospel heartfelt love of
[5:10] god
[5:11] going right down the middle of the road
[5:14] calling from both sides
[5:15] amen that's right and see now paul he
[5:18] said now paul
[5:19] wanted to get this church right in the
[5:22] middle of the road
[5:24] so he went and studied three years on
[5:26] the scriptures that he knew
[5:28] therefore paul wrote the bigger part of
[5:31] this new testament
[5:33] so paul's objective was to get the
[5:35] church balanced
[5:37] to establish them in the scripture so
[5:39] they wouldn't go off too far on this
[5:41] side
[5:41] wouldn't go far on that side but they
[5:43] know what they're believing
[5:45] he said now notice now we're going to
[5:47] start getting this background now where
[5:49] he's at
[5:51] writing it from prison and he's had all
[5:53] this experience
[5:54] but first this experience was first
[5:57] proven
[5:58] and this is his key letter to it
[6:01] this is his key letter romans and
[6:04] ephesians and so forth have their place
[6:06] but this is the key letter so the theme
[6:09] of the very first chapter
[6:11] he said now the whole first chapter is
[6:14] exalting jesus
[6:16] and separating him from being a prophet
[6:18] this is not just
[6:19] an ordinary prophet this is this is a
[6:22] god prophet
[6:24] he said that's the whole thing now i'll
[6:26] try to get to it just as quick as can
[6:28] now so we won't stay too long he said
[6:30] the
[6:30] first chapter is separating jesus from
[6:33] any prophet
[6:34] or any law or so forth and showing who
[6:38] jesus is so the first the whole book of
[6:42] hebrews is showing the superiority
[6:44] of of this new revelation the new
[6:47] testament
[6:48] and it's showing that the superiority of
[6:51] christ
[6:51] so that lays the background to get into
[6:54] hebrews chapter one
[6:55] so let's dive in and start unpacking
[6:57] some things
[6:58] in hebrews chapter one verse one it says
[7:00] god
[7:02] who at sundry times and in diverse
[7:05] manners
[7:05] spake in time past unto the fathers
[7:09] by the prophets so god in a lot of
[7:12] different ways
[7:13] a lot of different times spake
[7:16] it's so who's it doing the speaking it's
[7:18] actually god
[7:20] doing the speaking and he spoke to the
[7:22] father and the fathers
[7:23] were were the all the moses and elijah
[7:26] and all them the
[7:28] we talk about the patriarchs being the
[7:29] foundation all those back
[7:31] back there that's who he that god was
[7:33] actually speaking to and he spoke to
[7:35] them
[7:36] through prophets so so again if you go
[7:38] now go to verse 2
[7:40] and he starts saying now this man that
[7:42] i'm talking about is
[7:43] greater than all of these prophets all
[7:46] these men that we read about
[7:48] he and he's again he's speaking to the
[7:50] hebrews now you know about moses
[7:52] and you know about elijah you know about
[7:55] daniel and all those but this man is
[7:57] greater than all
[7:58] those all those prophets so in the old
[8:01] testament
[8:02] he gave his message through prophets
[8:05] so let's let's just dive into that now
[8:07] what what is a prophet
[8:09] and and you know sometimes we kind of
[8:12] forget
[8:13] what a prophet is your prophet is not
[8:15] just like a
[8:16] a good person that came on the on the
[8:18] scene and and somebody that we read
[8:20] about
[8:21] like a a a tale or whatever now now
[8:24] brother brown
[8:25] i just wrote some things down that he
[8:26] said about prophets he said
[8:28] now now first of all a prophet is going
[8:30] to be when a prophet comes on the scene
[8:32] with a message they're going to be
[8:33] rejected
[8:34] right as that's one one thing to look
[8:36] out for
[8:37] and he said never in all the history of
[8:41] the world
[8:42] did ever the church produce a prophet
[8:46] never did the church produce a prophet
[8:48] he said search it in the old testament
[8:51] new testament or in this day and the
[8:53] latter day
[8:54] showed me any prophet was ever raised
[8:57] out of the church
[8:58] in the last day right no prophet ever
[9:01] came out of the
[9:02] the group think of that day it wasn't
[9:05] ahab and jezebel that produced a prophet
[9:07] it was it wasn't babylon that produced
[9:09] the prophet of daniel
[9:10] they they all came out with a message
[9:12] straight from god that contradicted
[9:14] everything
[9:15] that seemed like the world of that day
[9:18] believed
[9:19] he said show me one ever come up out
[9:22] and showed me one time that a prophet
[9:26] a real servant of god that the
[9:28] ecclesiastical system of the world
[9:31] didn't condemn now that's one thing even
[9:34] when jesus began to preach
[9:36] he began to he began to blast the people
[9:38] of that day
[9:39] for for uh their their ancestors
[9:43] the that had killed the prophets and now
[9:45] he was saying now you're guilty of doing
[9:47] the same thing right
[9:48] you're you white you go out and white
[9:50] watch the tombs
[9:51] of the prophets and and your fathers are
[9:54] the ones that actually put them in the
[9:55] in the grave
[9:56] and so in matthew 23 for example he said
[9:59] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[10:01] hypocrites
[10:02] hypocrites because you build the tombs
[10:05] of the prophets
[10:06] and garnish the sepulchers of the
[10:08] righteous and say
[10:10] if we had been in the days of our
[10:12] fathers we would not have been partakers
[10:13] with them in the blood of the prophets
[10:16] if they're saying if we've been back
[10:18] there
[10:19] we would not have been doing what they
[10:21] didn't realize they were actually doing
[10:23] there at that same time
[10:26] wherefore ye be witnesses unto
[10:28] yourselves
[10:29] that you are the children of them which
[10:32] kill the prophets
[10:33] my that's straight talk right there but
[10:35] you can see how prophet
[10:37] that always has that characteristic of
[10:40] rejection a reject being rejected
[10:42] uh uh and so jesus is blasting that so
[10:45] what is the prophet
[10:46] amos 3 7 surely the lord god will do
[10:48] nothing
[10:50] but he revealeth his secret un under his
[10:52] servants the prophets
[10:54] so if you look online the definition of
[10:56] prophet
[10:57] just looking at a dictionary is somebody
[11:00] who speaks in behalf of and interprets
[11:03] the will of a super
[11:04] supernatural being a prophet is actually
[11:07] speaking the will
[11:08] of god they're actually speaking and
[11:11] interpreting what
[11:12] god wants done often rebuking or
[11:16] predicting events
[11:17] or an authoritative person
[11:20] who receives and communicates a message
[11:23] from god
[11:25] now do you think you think about what a
[11:27] privilege it is to have heard a prophet
[11:29] in this day to have heard
[11:30] direct from god a message that is not
[11:33] like stand alone but can be compared
[11:35] back to scripture
[11:37] and then actually gives the correct
[11:39] interpretation
[11:40] of scripture like the things we're
[11:41] reading about in hebrews
[11:44] and he said a prophet now these are the
[11:46] things that brother brahm said a prophet
[11:49] is a vindicated person i've indicated me
[11:51] that's proven
[11:52] it's proven out like for example when
[11:55] you hear if you hear a prophet say
[11:56] something's gonna happen there's gonna
[11:58] be a tornado or watch out there's gonna
[12:00] be
[12:00] somebody's gonna die or whatever then
[12:02] hold on a second
[12:04] see if it comes to pass and when those
[12:06] things begin to come to pass
[12:08] then you know it's proven out
[12:11] or for example if god actually has his
[12:14] picture taken when somebody
[12:15] then that's vindicated if you know
[12:18] you're in a service with
[12:19] with whether a prophet is speaking and
[12:22] he says watch out there goes the angel
[12:24] of the lord and it begins to move
[12:26] through the building and people begin to
[12:27] shout and rejoice wherever that angel of
[12:29] the lord is
[12:30] or people come up on the platform and
[12:33] you know that the presence of the angel
[12:35] of the lord is there and and he says he
[12:37] identifies it and
[12:38] begins to speak things in people's lives
[12:41] then you know
[12:42] it's vindicated because it's proven out
[12:44] a prophet is a vindicated person from
[12:47] birth
[12:48] coming down with the word of the lord
[12:51] a prophet means to give a personal
[12:53] experience under inspiration
[12:56] or foresee something he says see what a
[12:58] prophet is for
[13:00] he's not a healer he's to find out
[13:03] the will of god for you to find out the
[13:06] will of god so he's not a healer
[13:09] he's to find out the will of god for you
[13:11] and then if you can find out by
[13:13] by kind of opening up the scripture and
[13:15] showing that it's the will of god for
[13:16] you to be healed
[13:17] then you have confidence and you believe
[13:19] and you can receive your healing
[13:23] he said a prophet is different they're
[13:25] born a prophet
[13:27] and they come up prophets all that they
[13:29] say must be true
[13:30] every time or cannot be recognized as a
[13:33] prophet in the office
[13:34] so they're born a prophet so like make
[13:37] two or three years old he had
[13:38] his first vision or whatever but he
[13:40] wasn't born again yet
[13:42] but he was born a prophet he came into
[13:44] the world already a prophet
[13:46] the word of the lord came to a prophet
[13:49] what is a prophet
[13:50] is a witness to foretell to show a
[13:52] vindication that he is a diviner of the
[13:54] divine word
[13:56] the word of god came to the prophets a
[13:59] prophet
[14:00] is the word we know that
[14:03] the word prophet means a divine
[14:05] interpreter of the word
[14:07] the divine word is wrote and the prophet
[14:10] has the divine spirit of god within it
[14:14] to give the right interpretation of the
[14:16] word
[14:17] and he said now listen to this why does
[14:20] god send prophets
[14:23] he said we're so dull in faith
[14:26] till we fail to see him that's the
[14:29] reason god sends prophets to the earth
[14:31] see people won't read their bible and
[14:34] they don't they just go so
[14:35] god always sends them a sign and usually
[14:39] a prophet
[14:39] is assigned he said a prophet is a
[14:42] preacher
[14:44] true preacher on the word that stays
[14:46] with the word
[14:47] and they bring forth a revival that
[14:50] gathers that elect
[14:51] out of that generation and he said a
[14:55] prophet
[14:55] is an office of the church not a gift in
[14:58] the church
[15:00] but an office in the church not a gift
[15:02] that can just go from one to another
[15:04] but it's actually set an office in the
[15:06] church
[15:08] he said they're ordained predestined by
[15:11] god's foreknowledge
[15:12] to be what they are amen they're born
[15:15] prophets
[15:16] prophets are not made it's not something
[15:19] that's made that's that's
[15:20] you lay hands on and then there they
[15:23] begin to prophesy or something like that
[15:25] they're actually born that way and a
[15:28] prophet
[15:28] or a seer in one word is considered in
[15:31] the old testament
[15:32] is eagles now he said a prophet a
[15:35] prophet
[15:35] sees while he's awake and you know the
[15:37] way that brother brown described that is
[15:39] it's like you dream while you're awake
[15:41] your subconscious
[15:42] and your conscious are joined together
[15:44] and he said both of them are right
[15:46] together
[15:47] he can't help that now if your
[15:49] subconscious is back there there's no
[15:50] need of you trying to see a vision
[15:53] he wasn't made up like that if your
[15:55] subconscious is here in a dream if
[15:57] you're a dreamer not a vision
[15:59] and this man sees visions can't help it
[16:01] he's just made up like that
[16:03] now instead of going to sleep a seer
[16:06] is one conscious he doesn't go to sleep
[16:08] like the dream does
[16:09] but it's just so close to him till he
[16:12] just breaks
[16:13] from one to another and that he sees
[16:15] things
[16:16] just like a dream now we know
[16:19] that prophets weren't just in the old
[16:21] testament they're in the new testament
[16:23] as well because we know that there was
[16:25] the prophet agabus and
[16:26] and and so many others and and then in
[16:29] this day
[16:30] we've heard the voice of the last day
[16:32] prophet and
[16:34] and you know i was sharing with brother
[16:36] wade i was talking to a preacher
[16:38] somewhere and he was relating how
[16:40] that a prophet had come to his church
[16:42] and and there's prophets
[16:43] in latin america and prophecy in africa
[16:46] the prophets
[16:47] there is a five-fold ministry and there
[16:49] we have all
[16:50] five offices in the chur in the bride
[16:53] today
[16:54] active and and prophecy and of course
[16:56] you go back to how do you tell a prophet
[16:58] how do you tell a real prophet
[17:00] you make sure that they're vindicated
[17:02] and proven and the things that they're
[17:03] saying
[17:04] come to pass and then you can recognize
[17:07] and benefit
[17:08] so now lay that background in the old
[17:11] testament they heard a prophet so
[17:13] prophet is like a trumpet
[17:14] that's communicating what what the will
[17:17] of god is
[17:19] so in the old testament they heard the
[17:20] voice of god through a prophet
[17:23] but yet in hebrews chapter 1 verse 2 he
[17:26] said now
[17:27] they heard through prophets but it hath
[17:30] in these last days
[17:31] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[17:35] appointed
[17:35] heir of all things by whom also he made
[17:39] the worlds
[17:40] so now they heard through prophets but
[17:42] now
[17:43] now here in the new testament here that
[17:45] paul was speaking about we've heard from
[17:47] the one who was the voice behind the
[17:49] prophet
[17:50] he actually manifested and walked in
[17:53] flesh and
[17:53] and spoke and shared things with them
[17:56] and see brother brown said the prophets
[17:58] of the old day
[17:59] was the spirit of jesus christ it was
[18:02] the spirit of jesus christ actually
[18:04] speaking through them
[18:05] moses you know was a kind of a type of a
[18:09] prophet joseph
[18:10] was a was a type of what one day would
[18:12] come that jesus christ
[18:14] would would be manifested and he said in
[18:16] that day he spoke by the prophets
[18:19] but this day through his son
[18:23] that was the word of a prophet there
[18:26] this is the word of the son today
[18:29] amen so see how paul was comparing that
[18:32] was the word of a prophet then but now
[18:35] we've got the word of the son direct the
[18:37] word of jesus christ
[18:39] that was the word of a prophet there
[18:40] this is the word of the son today he
[18:42] said in other words
[18:44] if you're looking at the shadow the
[18:46] negative you might make a mistake
[18:48] but this is developed the picture is
[18:51] clear
[18:52] that was by the prophet this is by his
[18:55] son
[18:56] so the one that the prophet spoke of is
[18:59] now
[19:00] now clearly represented he's declared
[19:04] that was by negative this is by positive
[19:06] amen you see it
[19:07] there isn't a chance to lose it's a
[19:10] positive thing
[19:12] this day through his son now so he says
[19:15] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[19:19] things
[19:21] right there in verse two right hathan
[19:23] these days spoken unto us by his son
[19:25] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[19:28] things
[19:29] so he had an appointment an appointment
[19:31] now brother branham explains it like
[19:33] this he said the appointment was made
[19:35] back of course it was made before the
[19:37] foundation of the world he's going to be
[19:39] heir of all things but he had an
[19:40] appointment that was declared
[19:42] in genesis chapter 3 verse 15.
[19:45] amen where it says that i will put
[19:47] enmity between thee and the woman
[19:50] and between thy seed and her seed it
[19:52] shall bruise thy head
[19:53] and thou shalt bruise his heel so the
[19:56] one
[19:57] that was gonna that that appointment was
[19:59] speaking of is he's now
[20:01] paul this is who paul is talking about
[20:03] there the appointment was kept
[20:05] the appointment was kept and he showed
[20:07] up to die on the cross
[20:09] and and destroy the works of the devil
[20:12] because it says and between thy seed and
[20:14] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[20:15] thou shalt bruise his heel
[20:17] so his heel was bruised on the cross and
[20:19] he bruised the head of the serpent
[20:21] through the act that he performed and
[20:23] kept the appointment
[20:25] that god made before the foundation of
[20:27] the world
[20:29] whom he hath appointed air of all things
[20:32] by whom
[20:32] also he made the world now now the
[20:35] brother yesterday was
[20:36] kind of getting on this in his sermon i
[20:38] really i really enjoyed that i'm looking
[20:40] forward to today
[20:42] because uh he was speaking on how that
[20:45] who by whom also he made the worlds that
[20:47] that there are actually
[20:49] that this this man that paul is speaking
[20:51] of actually created all of the worlds
[20:53] that like as he was speaking on
[20:55] yesterday you can look up into the night
[20:57] sky and see
[20:58] all the stars and all the things so who
[21:00] made the world brother said
[21:02] christ christ made the worlds world's
[21:04] plural
[21:05] and hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 and i i
[21:08] know i've got just a few more minutes
[21:09] i'll be winding up here in just a second
[21:11] he said through faith we understand that
[21:13] the worlds
[21:15] were framed by the word of god so that
[21:18] things
[21:19] which are seen were not made of things
[21:21] which do appear
[21:23] now think about everything that we see
[21:25] up in up in the night sky
[21:26] all those worlds were actually framed by
[21:29] the
[21:30] word of god and kept in place by the
[21:32] word of god
[21:33] and so you think about that if the if
[21:35] the word of god
[21:37] is powerful enough to frame the heavens
[21:40] and the worlds and keep them in place
[21:42] and keep them in their orbit and doing
[21:44] what they're supposed to do
[21:45] then the word of god is also has power
[21:48] to keep
[21:48] you in line and keep to give you
[21:50] structure in your life and to
[21:52] put you in your place and to give you
[21:54] power over the enemy
[21:56] now brother ram said in questions and
[21:58] answers is there more than one world
[22:00] he said yes there's worlds of worlds
[22:03] now think about that worlds of worlds
[22:05] hebrews the first chapter the second
[22:07] verse
[22:08] and the third verse there's worlds of
[22:11] worlds
[22:12] god created the world w-o-r-l-d-s to
[22:16] drive at home
[22:17] worlds he said go out here to mount
[22:19] palomar mount palomar and there's an
[22:21] observatory in san diego and he said and
[22:24] look through to that
[22:25] observatory there and see a hundred
[22:28] and twenty million years of life space
[22:31] through that
[22:31] out yonder at the worlds and the solar
[22:35] systems and the solar system out there
[22:37] how the worlds and the other suns and
[22:40] moons
[22:40] and worlds and stars and 120 million
[22:45] years of life space and then beyond that
[22:49] still more worlds and moons and stars
[22:53] so this is the one that paul is talking
[22:56] about
[22:57] you've heard all the prophets and all of
[22:59] the stories of the old testament and
[23:01] you've got the law but now i'm telling
[23:03] you about the one
[23:04] that was appointed air of all things
[23:06] that made all the worlds
[23:08] i'm going to tell you uh
[23:12] and if we when you go over into hebrews
[23:13] chapter 2 this is why you need to pay
[23:16] attention to the things that this man
[23:19] has said is what paul's saying in
[23:20] chapter two
[23:22] if you if you've heard the word of the
[23:23] angels and the ministers
[23:26] now hear the word of this man and that
[23:28] the musicians can go ahead and
[23:29] start coming forward hear that hear the
[23:33] word of this man that's made the worlds
[23:36] that's framed everything with the word
[23:38] of his power
[23:39] that's framed everything up this man
[23:42] this
[23:42] jesus christ that we serve and we'll
[23:45] stop her there i
[23:46] i i can't believe we want to make the
[23:48] verse 2. anyway
[24:04] right
