[25:19] Flesh the word made flesh Romans
[25:22] 8:18 let's pray dear heavenly father
[25:26] today Lord truly is the day of salvation
[25:28] and we pray Lord that you would just
[25:30] take what's being said here Lord and
[25:32] break it to the people Lord may they
[25:34] understand Lord that you're the only one
[25:36] that can reveal we can only open your ey
[25:39] their eyes Lord just so they can see you
[25:41] father and not see us as a human being
[25:44] Lord but to see you and to glory in your
[25:47] salvation Lord glory in your word and
[25:50] the things that you've done for us we
[25:52] pray that you'd be with the sanctuary

[25:56] you sent the word and healed them and
[25:57] delivered them from destruction I pray

[26:03] Fields just be with them Lord bless them
[26:05] give us today our daily bread Lord
[26:08] forgive us of our sins and our many
[26:09] mistakes in Jesus name we ask these
[26:11] things
[26:13] amen we kind of spoke on a little
[26:15] thought we out in Oklahoma we went over
[26:18] the uh permissive will perfect will and
[26:21] then Dad and I got us talking about a
[26:23] few things and and um this still may be
[26:26] part of chosen in him but it may be a
[26:28] little different angle Romans 88: 18 for
[26:33] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[26:35] present time are not worthy to be
[26:36] compared with the glory which shall be
[26:38] revealed in us for the earnest
[26:41] expectation of the creature or the
[26:44] creation waiteth for the manifestation
[26:46] of the sons of God in other words for
[26:49] the authority to come back right for the
[26:53] creature was made subject to vanity not
[26:55] willingly in other words the creat
[26:58] didn't have anything to do with this
[27:00] fall Adam sure he was part of it but
[27:02] we're talking there this creation is
[27:04] talking the outside world because it's
[27:06] groaning waiting because he's Paul's
[27:09] going to bring it into us though right
[27:11] for the creature was made subject to
[27:13] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[27:15] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[27:17] because the creature or creation itself
[27:20] also shall be delivered in other words
[27:22] he's saying that when these manifested
[27:24] Sons start to begin to show their on the
[27:28] earth that the creation outside right
[27:30] that's what they're looking for right
[27:32] that's why every every animal that's
[27:34] dead on the side of the road that's why
[27:35] every tree that's leaning that's why
[27:37] every flower that's
[27:39] dying it's looking at me and you amen
[27:42] right because I believe in the fall when
[27:45] when when the fall happened and Adam
[27:47] sold out the human race he sold out the
[27:49] Earth too remember cuz he gave that
[27:51] title back and then now as the lion
[27:55] began to used to go up to Adam and and
[27:58] and was soothing and petting and all
[28:00] that brother boy then all of a sudden
[28:02] the lion looked at Adam a little
[28:04] different
[28:05] angle well in other words he's looking
[28:07] at Adam and saying you did
[28:09] this bring us back
[28:13] yeah because you look and see what in
[28:15] the Millennium and in the future home
[28:17] you see it back in order that's right
[28:18] lying laying with the lamb doing
[28:20] everything that happened in the Garden
[28:21] of Eden before the fall right because
[28:24] the creature itself also shall be
[28:26] delivered what when we're
[28:28] delivered we got to be delivered first
[28:30] then the Earth comes later from the
[28:32] bondage of corruption into the Glorious
[28:34] Liberty of the children of God for we
[28:37] know Paul's telling us that we know that
[28:40] the whole creation granth and prevaileth
[28:42] in pain together until now and not only
[28:47] they see Paul saying not only they out
[28:49] there but ourselves also which have the
[28:52] first fruits of the spirit even we
[28:54] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[28:56] for the ad adoption to Wi or to witness
[28:59] or to understand the Redemption of our
[29:01] body you may be seated in the Lord as
[29:03] His blessings reading the word I think
[29:04] we cut the air conditioner off up
[29:08] here it's actually 70° in here okay so
[29:12] we're going to cool it down just a
[29:16] second if you need anything to wrap up
[29:18] with that's why we brought
[29:20] these and we got a moon and you need
[29:23] some light these things put off a lot of
[29:25] heat but in Roman 8 the word manifest
[29:28] means to make known now to make known
[29:31] who to make known you or to make known
[29:35] God all right that's where we're getting
[29:37] off the line we going to make known God
[29:39] or we're going to make known ourselves
[29:41] cuz if you make known God God's going to
[29:43] make us known right everybody wait amen
[29:47] all right what are we going to
[29:52] manifest are we going to manifest great
[29:54] signs and wonders we could yeah but do
[29:57] we have
[29:59] to I thought our commission in this end
[30:01] time was to fulfill the word for your
[30:03] day right right and your hour we don't
[30:07] need to build an
[30:08] ark we don't need to to go and and and
[30:12] deliver a group of people out of Egypt
[30:14] we are going to have to
[30:17] move put it right there maybe I won't go
[30:19] over that way I do I'll fall you
[30:23] loud but fulfill the word for your day
[30:26] so we don't have these things even
[30:28] listen now even I get to it in just a
[30:30] second
[30:32] even in the book of Acts sure another
[30:36] book of Acts is being written but it's
[30:37] not the same one we're not Paul right
[30:40] we're not
[30:42] Peter we're Dean
[30:45] Gibby Terence Dale right we're in this
[30:49] time right they were then not taking
[30:52] anything away from them but like I was
[30:54] telling them out in Oklahoma Paul was
[30:56] standing looking in he Hebrews 11 and
[30:58] all those great warriors of faith and he
[31:00] said they he's pointing they without us
[31:04] right will never get out of the ground
[31:07] but Paul was prophesying of a group of
[31:10] people that's going to be over here in
[31:11] the end time looking back at Paul and
[31:15] those people and saying they right
[31:19] without us amen cannot be made perfect
[31:22] all right so it's not that it's not that
[31:24] that Paul's saying hey you know I'm
[31:26] perfect we're perfecting all those
[31:28] people no he was perfecting to a
[31:31] place his time right sure then in our
[31:35] time we have to see that all that that
[31:38] which is perfect has come that which is
[31:40] in part is not going to be done away
[31:42] it's not that we don't need them anymore
[31:44] they need us
[31:46] right and like Daddy said this morning I
[31:49] didn't write the Bible this way this is
[31:52] the way he wrote it that's right he
[31:53] wants us to be here if you believe in
[31:55] predestination you'll believe that that
[31:57] you're sitting right exactly where
[31:58] you're supposed to be in the end time
[32:01] right so let's like I told him in in
[32:03] Oklahoma I said let's quit being
[32:05] babies right let's quit having to
[32:08] explain the
[32:09] milk I like milk but when I go to a
[32:13] steakhouse when I go to
[32:15] Murphy's I don't want
[32:17] milk I want a big old sir about that
[32:21] big they give you a 24 o sirloin and
[32:25] they cut it in half and you can split it
[32:26] with your partner who's there with you
[32:30] dick I might want a glass of milk with
[32:31] it but I don't want just a glass of
[32:33] milk and I don't want to go back and
[32:36] start eating baby food we need to grow
[32:39] up and see like Daddy was saying today
[32:41] he's he's bringing us to a point because
[32:44] predestination is by for knowledge but
[32:46] we got to believe like I told them that
[32:49] there is a predestinated right there
[32:51] spot right yeah right that we got to
[32:54] come to right now you you determine
[32:57] whether you get there or not but God's
[33:00] going to have this spot right here right
[33:03] amen all the people that are dead can't
[33:06] attain to that but all which are alive
[33:08] and remain that's what the scripture
[33:10] said are going to make this point so
[33:14] this point is predestinated eternally
[33:16] from God can't come any other way will
[33:18] not come any other way now you and I
[33:21] must decide and he knew who would be at
[33:23] that spot right but we got to grow up
[33:25] and believe that there is a
[33:27] predestinated line a shoot you say well
[33:30] he didn't pull me through a tube
[33:32] no but he owns the tube yeah and if he
[33:36] wants to pull me through it he can but
[33:38] that brother Brandon was making that uh
[33:40] that U point because like with this
[33:43] thing right here I can do more by
[33:44] pulling it but if you push it you can't
[33:47] you can't do a lot pushing a chain but
[33:49] you can pull it right God's pulling us
[33:52] towards something it's just you and I
[33:53] have to connect to it Hallelujah okay
[33:57] he's going to pull the chain whether I
[33:59] grab a hold of it or
[34:00] not right all right so now let's grab a
[34:04] hold of it with faith let's grab a hold
[34:07] of it those people did in the Old
[34:08] Testament right up to Paul Paul did
[34:10] right on up to here somebody held on to
[34:13] it and attain to their age not even in
[34:17] my note we'll be
[34:19] okay but in end time br's got to
[34:21] identify herself different right than
[34:24] anybody else amen right
[34:28] we're done there's nobody else to go and
[34:30] hand it to except the
[34:35] Jews and they will receive two prophets
[34:39] right that are predestinated in the
[34:41] scripture they will come
[34:44] now identified
[34:48] here no other age will see a Redemption
[34:51] of a body except this age all right all
[34:54] other ages are gone right
[34:58] no other AIDS will come to full
[35:01] manifestation now we've got that's what
[35:03] I was trying to get them to see in
[35:05] Oklahoma now we've got to go and
[35:08] focus paab
[35:10] binoculars you can get a wide angle but
[35:12] if you want to focus in and see what uh
[35:16] what size that deer is that's fine but
[35:17] you can if you got a real good set of
[35:19] binoculars you can go up to those horns
[35:21] and you can count the points you can go
[35:22] on a little bit further and you can see
[35:25] the little bitty points why you're
[35:26] focusing in more right we got to focus
[35:29] in to get out of here amen Paul said I
[35:32] run this race and I'm going to run it
[35:35] and he knew what he was going to attain
[35:37] to a crown of life would be given to him
[35:39] but he knew that he would not take a
[35:40] body chain that's you and I that's our
[35:44] promise amen signs
[35:48] Glory the devil will have them wonders
[35:53] the devil will have them that's right
[35:55] false anointed one ones will be
[35:58] everywhere but our promise is that we
[36:02] will be changed in the moment in
[36:03] twinking of an
[36:05] eye all right full manifestation what do
[36:08] we think is it going to be a walking
[36:11] superum super hero you know and that we
[36:14] zap this person and zap this person and
[36:17] no what happened to Jesus on Mount
[36:21] Transfiguration he was
[36:24] transfigured yeah he had witnessed is
[36:27] there but now was there a sign or a
[36:30] wonder they come down off the mountain
[36:31] and Jesus said tell this Vision to No
[36:35] One In other words don't go out and give
[36:37] there won't be a sign or a Wonder to
[36:39] this that's right right except one thing
[36:42] and that's the son of man will be risen
[36:44] again Amen in other words it's going to
[36:48] happen to a group of people over here
[36:51] when Elijah comes all right we'll get to
[36:54] it in just a
[36:55] second it does not mean that if we do
[36:59] have signs we're going to be right and
[37:00] we don't have signs we're going to be
[37:02] wrong right right the prophet said
[37:05] having a wonderful day does not mean
[37:07] you're saved that's having a cloudy day
[37:10] does not mean you're lost right
[37:13] right what's our promise
[37:15] believe have faith to believe what's
[37:19] going
[37:20] on sign
[37:22] Seekers they'll get what they want
[37:24] that's right sign Seekers will get I
[37:28] said sign Seekers people that go looking
[37:31] for signs will get exactly what they
[37:34] want we'll read a scripture on that
[37:37] later but look what happened in the
[37:41] Bible Israel come out a Mak multitude
[37:44] come
[37:45] out they had some of the greatest signs
[37:47] and wonders of all
[37:49] times they took a nation like the United
[37:52] States of America and destroyed it right
[37:56] absolutely abolutely destroyed
[37:58] it and the mixed multitude and the other
[38:01] 99% of the Israelites never made it to
[38:05] their
[38:07] promise that's right only Joshua and
[38:11] Caleb of that original group that saw
[38:14] what happened those that are 20 years
[38:16] old they weren't even born when they
[38:19] come out of is Egypt so they wasn't
[38:21] under the great sign sure they come up
[38:23] through with the Mana what about being
[38:25] fed every day
[38:27] we'd be bigger than we are now if it was
[38:30] given to
[38:31] us what about all those things I want
[38:33] you to get a mind you know something in
[38:35] your
[38:36] mind they came out under signs and
[38:39] wonders and actually disregarded
[38:42] it oh yeah they said we loathe this
[38:45] bread right we don't have any water to
[38:49] drink where's our
[38:52] water God give them all the clothes to
[38:54] wear they never wore out for 40
[38:58] years see what people are yeah right and
[39:02] I know they're unregenerated people but
[39:04] they're a type of you and I for today
[39:08] right I think I'll stay down here more
[39:11] this is
[39:14] better what you
[39:16] say amen amen thank you maybe we get
[39:20] more amens on tap I hear these other
[39:23] preachers you know on the internet and
[39:25] stuff you pull on they got one we may
[39:27] need to get a little
[39:28] microphone well maybe we
[39:36] don't oh
[39:40] me shut
[39:42] up but no I like to hear amen's on the
[39:45] tape you know sometimes you hear Daddy
[39:47] on the internet we were gone you know at
[39:49] Thanksgiving and and uh we were at jun's
[39:53] Mom and Dad's and I had heard all their
[39:54] cussing and drinking and smoking all I
[39:56] wanted so Sunday morning I hit the
[39:59] internet Daddy was screaming just as
[40:01] soon as I cut the thing on and they said
[40:02] cut that down I said forget
[40:05] it I listen to y'all all weekend you
[40:08] going to listen to this buddy they
[40:09] scattered out of the
[40:11] house but thank God for the internet
[40:13] that we can do that
[40:15] yes but sometimes he was preaching along
[40:17] and you didn't hear the word no amen
[40:20] every once in a while you hear dick say
[40:21] something you know amen I like to hear a
[40:24] congregation that rolls amen amen just
[40:27] kind of gets you in the gets you in the
[40:29] mood I guess but whether you amen or not
[40:32] if it's the truth it's the
[40:35] truth but Israel comes in with a mixed
[40:37] multitude where did they fail did they
[40:39] fail in believing the signs and wonders
[40:42] was that what the whole thing was
[40:44] about what was the whole thing about a
[40:46] Promised
[40:50] Land that's the whole thing the whole
[40:52] thing that that God took them and pulled
[40:54] them out of is out of Egypt for for one
[40:56] purpose that was to put them in a
[40:58] Promised Land not to show signs and
[41:00] wonders he had to show them to try to
[41:03] get the people to believe disregarded
[41:05] they didn't do it didn't do a bit of
[41:07] good the same two went over that you
[41:10] know that went over had they probably
[41:11] not been any sign cuz there's only two
[41:13] people Joshua didn't come up to kades
[41:16] Baria and say well we've had a lot of
[41:19] signs I believe no he said God said it
[41:22] Caleb said God told us he weren't run
[41:24] through the crowd and he said shut up
[41:27] shut up you read the Bible didn't he he
[41:30] steal the people be quiet listen to
[41:34] Joshua listen to the Holy Ghost that's
[41:37] our type today right and we're a type of
[41:40] the of Caleb the end time believer now
[41:44] the they had the hand of God every day
[41:46] every day but they were given a word
[41:48] test and they failed it yeah right right
[41:52] right given the word test they failed it
[41:54] did not matter and God even kept on
[41:56] giving signs and wonders sure right cuz
[42:00] we're going to get to where the signs
[42:01] and wonders will deceive even the very
[42:03] length if it were possible the
[42:06] signs
[42:08] Seekers but the Joshua and Caleb group
[42:11] they manifested the word for their day
[42:14] that's right am that put them in the
[42:16] word of God Amen that put them in the
[42:20] predestinated group of people right they
[42:22] took the word and held it you hear the
[42:26] prophet you know you see the Bible said
[42:28] they took the word so did so did Joshua
[42:30] and Caleb whose word did they
[42:32] take huh
[42:35] Moses huh the end time leader for the
[42:38] day for their time you know their time
[42:39] their leader Joshua didn't have a Bible
[42:42] to run to or a quote book right no he
[42:45] believed what his messenger
[42:48] said even when the messenger went off
[42:51] the scene he took that message and took
[42:54] it right across the promised land amen
[42:57] right and he wasn't preaching that the
[42:59] messenger was going to Moses going to
[43:01] come
[43:03] back the Bible says Moses thy servant is
[43:07] dead that's what he told Joshua Joshua 1
[43:10] Moses thy servant is dead you're going
[43:11] to take the same thing forward am but
[43:14] now listen how did they get in the
[43:17] promised
[43:18] land signs and wonders oh yeah the
[43:22] Jordan River open opened up but what I'm
[43:26] saying is did they go into the promised
[43:28] land and go Canaanites go this way am
[43:31] malachit you go this way no they fought
[43:35] for every piece of ground they took they
[43:38] had to fight for it amen that's my whole
[43:41] point sure there was there was signs and
[43:44] wonders among them when they got in the
[43:45] promised land because Joshua come to a
[43:47] place that he needed more sunlight he
[43:49] said Son stand still but you know what
[43:51] he still he didn't sit down and go okay
[43:54] God fight the battle
[43:57] no he said God I need some time so that
[44:00] I can fight the battle right am I
[44:03] getting
[44:04] somewhere signs will be among the
[44:07] Believers in what you need for the time
[44:10] right right you call on signs and
[44:13] wonders and you may call the devil
[44:17] that's you call on look because that's
[44:20] what a lot baam right think of bam he
[44:24] wanted something so but God said no then
[44:26] finally he said go on but it still
[44:28] worked for the perfect will of God
[44:30] that's right always will right right but
[44:33] they got into promised land they still
[44:35] had to physically fight God was leading
[44:37] them I've been going back through the
[44:39] Old Testament and reading even David and
[44:41] some of those uh Old Testament Warriors
[44:44] they had to fight but they had God among
[44:46] them amen right God didn't leave them
[44:49] what did they have they they found the
[44:52] will of God the mind of God David would
[44:55] go and and say
[44:57] God what about today what about the
[45:00] Battle God will say wait for the going
[45:03] of the mulberry bush yeah and why'd he
[45:06] say
[45:07] that he said David wait for the going of
[45:11] the mberry Bush he said because the
[45:13] battle is yours amen amen right because
[45:17] the battle is yours God
[45:20] leading but God not doing it for us
[45:23] right something you and I have to do
[45:26] amen amen all right we'll get to
[45:28] something
[45:30] here and the only time they lost the
[45:33] battle was when when aen done something
[45:38] outside the word of God that's right
[45:40] amen he took a
[45:43] garment and he took a wedge of
[45:47] gold now what is the definition of
[45:52] religion garment or covering right
[45:56] the definition of religion is a covering
[45:59] that's what brother R said Adam and Eve
[46:00] was doing in the garden they put on fig
[46:01] leaves went back in bushes and had
[46:03] church right they covered up what they
[46:05] thought was wrong amen right all right
[46:08] so now achen takes a garment and takes a
[46:14] wedge aen brought something in the
[46:16] congregation of God that was not of
[46:20] God God told him he said destroy them
[46:23] don't bring anything in here you know
[46:25] how all those people Saul all those
[46:26] people got in trouble for not obeying
[46:28] the word of God right you stay inside
[46:30] the word of God you know he even told
[46:32] Solomon he told Solomon he said Solomon
[46:35] as long as you lead my people in my ways
[46:38] I'll bless you right and he did until he
[46:41] got older right and then when he started
[46:43] sacrificing the idols God went away from
[46:46] him and he died all right
[46:51] now aen brought something in that was
[46:54] not supposed to be there
[46:56] right a a
[46:58] garment and a
[47:01] wedge what is a
[47:03] garment he brought another
[47:05] Doctrine or another
[47:07] idea into the
[47:10] camp and then the
[47:12] wedge is a
[47:14] division right what do you do with the
[47:16] wedge yeah with a wedge you separate you
[47:20] divide amen he brought a false doctrine
[47:23] that divided the people and people died
[47:26] amen right right now where did he hide
[47:31] it he hid it in his tent that's right in
[47:35] the Earth right oh
[47:38] my a't that's what the Bible said it was
[47:42] understand his tent it was under his
[47:44] blankets in buried in the
[47:48] earth oh my you get out of the word and
[47:52] you see what happens right cuz we don't
[47:54] live in natural tents anymore
[47:56] the Bible says you are a temple of the
[47:57] Holy Ghost you're the tent that God
[47:59] lives in that's right maybe the reason
[48:02] that we don't have these adoptions and
[48:06] these wonderful things that we think we
[48:08] ought to have maybe we got a few things
[48:10] hid in our
[48:11] tents that we need to get rid of right
[48:14] right because something's going to have
[48:16] to happen to break this chain of still
[48:19] being here oh yeah every time I see
[48:23] somebody like brother beam and some of
[48:24] the older ones you know not him him
[48:27] having a wreck right but some of the
[48:29] others dying off I think God the chains
[48:31] got to be broke somewhere that's right
[48:33] like Daddy was getting to this morning
[48:34] some somewhere has got to be broke
[48:36] somewhere you know that we've got to
[48:39] come to and the only thing I can see is
[48:43] the prophet said one time that full
[48:44] obedience brings us to adoption right he
[48:47] didn't say part he said full obedience
[48:50] right right now I was thinking today
[48:53] because daddy said something you you
[48:55] know about the change of the body and
[48:56] everybody amen that was the biggest amen
[48:58] he got of the whole
[49:00] sermon but some of those amens that you
[49:02] hear are is that coming from a life
[49:04] that's lived come on it's not just that
[49:07] you're going to come to a place that
[49:09] spot's just not right there and you're
[49:11] going to
[49:12] go right you
[49:14] got it's got to be here amen right we
[49:17] can say Amen about a body change all we
[49:19] want to but unless we live in the
[49:22] economy of God unless we don't unless we
[49:24] get rid of all the wedges and we get rid
[49:26] of all the
[49:29] garments come on because remember the
[49:31] character of those Israelites were built
[49:33] in
[49:34] battle because the worst thing God and
[49:37] I'm sorry the worst thing God done was
[49:39] was feed them by hand right he babied
[49:43] them the worst thing he done was handed
[49:46] out stuff to him and he knows that right
[49:49] is that the worst thing for you and I
[49:51] amen I think about my kids you know Josh
[49:54] is here Hanna's not
[49:57] you try not to let them get so far in a
[49:58] hole oh my but sometimes it's good to
[50:01] let them get in a hole and dig their way
[50:02] out amen thank you Jesus cuz you know
[50:04] what it builds character than because
[50:07] I'm getting to something we all want
[50:10] Power everybody wants great signs and
[50:13] wonders everybody wants power the
[50:15] prophet said power right apart from
[50:19] character it's
[50:21] satanic but now wait power is not bad
[50:25] right right fitted with character he
[50:27] said fit to
[50:29] rule that's what we come into fit to
[50:31] rule this is fit to rule this point I'm
[50:33] pointing to this point is fit to rule
[50:35] that's what we're coming to character is
[50:37] built in battles not signs and
[50:41] wonders signs and wonders gets your
[50:43] faith built
[50:45] up but what if it's a false sign oh what
[50:49] if it's a false wonder the Bible says
[50:50] we're going to read it lying wonders
[50:53] that's right
[50:56] lying
[50:59] wonders that's not of
[51:02] God that happened then it happened now
[51:06] that's right but remember this is not
[51:09] for this is not for mixed multitude this
[51:11] is for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[51:14] right because they will have whatever
[51:17] they want brother R said they had carnal
[51:20] impersonator somebody go out and
[51:22] impersonate the gift we were listening
[51:23] to it coming coming home Friday
[51:25] you know they were all in the hand and
[51:28] you'll read on spok Words Original Seed
[51:29] he said you know all fires Balls of Fire
[51:32] on the pulpit he never said that they
[51:34] were right he said they had all those
[51:37] carnal impersonators right amen right
[51:40] but when he comes down to the word
[51:43] that's what we're looking at because the
[51:45] mixed multitude couldn't handle what God
[51:48] even what God was given them the mix
[51:51] multitude is the one that murmured Dayan
[51:53] Kora Bible says you know they they The
[51:56] Gangs saying of Kora now what did cor
[52:00] do what' cor do cor said Moses you take
[52:05] too much on yourself oh yeah let us set
[52:08] up right a place over
[52:11] here what he wanted to divide that's
[52:14] right right but the great divider God
[52:18] said Moses you stand in one place and
[52:21] you tell them people make a choice you
[52:22] either come over here or you stay over
[52:24] there right and ones that stayed over
[52:26] there they're still down in the earth
[52:28] somewhere
[52:29] right but let's turn to Matthew
[52:32] 12 Jesus spoke of worship more than he
[52:36] spoke of signs amen let me say that one
[52:40] more
[52:41] time had to do this in Oklahoma cuz they
[52:44] were they didn't amen cuz I I was
[52:46] preaching where daddy you know would
[52:48] come to the place where Jesus didn't
[52:50] bring us an
[52:51] inheritance he he come to get us back to
[52:54] the inheritance boy they were they did
[52:56] that kind of that kind of puts a kink in
[52:58] your armor every once in a while when
[52:59] people look at you but the prophet said
[53:02] it right amen Jesus didn't come to bring
[53:05] us an inheritance he come to bring us a
[53:07] way he said I am the way back to that
[53:12] inheritance so I said it about three
[53:14] times and I said okay I'm going to read
[53:15] what the prophet said you won't believe
[53:16] me I'll just read the
[53:20] quote Matthew 12 they got
[53:24] it
[53:30] probably had more compliments on that
[53:31] sermon I guess than any
[53:34] other we know where all blessings come
[53:36] from Matthew
[53:39] 12
[53:41] 38 Jesus speaks of one
[53:46] sign certain of the scribes and
[53:48] Pharisees answered and said Master we
[53:50] would see a sign from thee but he
[53:52] answered and said unto them an evil and
[53:54] adulterous generation seeketh after a
[53:57] sign now hold on to your pants leg
[54:00] because Believers have signs right okay
[54:04] we I'm just we're looking at sign
[54:06] Seekers come on cuz that's just what he
[54:08] says in a spir an evil and adulterous
[54:10] generation seeketh after a sign they go
[54:13] in other words they go looking for it
[54:15] digging through the bushes digging
[54:16] through the word trying to build things
[54:18] up with with fast music or or a loud
[54:20] singing or or you know or a bead or
[54:22] something that's not it
[54:25] and there shall be no sign there shall
[54:28] no sign be given to it but the sign of
[54:30] the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three
[54:33] days and three nights in the whale's
[54:34] belly so shall the son of man be three
[54:36] days and three nights in the heart of
[54:38] the earth then it talks about the men of
[54:40] Nineveh and then the queen of the South
[54:42] cuz he said greater than a Jonas is here
[54:44] and greater than a Solomon is here right
[54:46] cuz he was standing there telling them
[54:49] the son of man have to be three days we
[54:51] understand why that how that happened
[54:52] that that he was only in the heart of
[54:54] the earth two days and then now he's he
[54:55] come out of the come out of the church
[54:57] ages in where in Matthew 17 where he
[55:00] said Son of Man be risen again that's
[55:02] what's happening now Matthew 16:4 let's
[55:05] read
[55:13] that pretty much the same thing but he
[55:16] they ask him again I guess they didn't
[55:18] understand him the first time then the
[55:20] Pharisees also with the Sadducees came
[55:22] and tempting desired him that he would
[55:23] show him a sign from heaven
[55:26] did they just want to see a sign a
[55:27] couple of scriptures ago now they want
[55:29] to see a sign from
[55:30] Heaven Jesus said when it is evening you
[55:33] say it will be fair weather for the sky
[55:34] is red and in the morning it will be
[55:37] foul weather today for the sky is red
[55:39] and lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can
[55:41] discern the face of the sky but you but
[55:44] can you not discern the signs of the
[55:48] times a wicked and adulterous generation
[55:51] seeketh after a sign and there shall no
[55:53] sign be given unto it
[55:55] now brother random said I don't have the
[55:57] quote I didn't bring any quotes with me
[55:58] today I just brought scripture brother
[56:00] random said that that was not their
[56:03] generation it was this generation right
[56:07] now anybody with one eye and a half
[56:09] sense ought to know an adult a wicked
[56:11] and adulterous generation is this
[56:12] generation Jesus was not speaking of the
[56:15] Pharisees and the Sadducees generation
[56:17] he was speaking of this day I got the
[56:20] quote back there I just didn't bring it
[56:21] I pulled it up but brother random said
[56:23] they were he was speaking of now right a
[56:25] sodomite condition yes all right so he
[56:28] wasn't speaking of then he's speaking of
[56:30] now so now bring it to right
[56:33] here right a wicked and adulter
[56:36] generation seeketh after a sign and
[56:38] there shall no sign be given unto it
[56:41] what that generation but the sign of the
[56:43] Prophet Jonas amen and the brother Rand
[56:45] said the sign of the Prophet Jonas was
[56:47] the
[56:48] resurrection we got a resurrection sign
[56:51] the prophet bringing the word of God to
[56:53] us and signs and wonders come coming
[56:55] from the prophet showing
[56:57] us that he had risen amen all right so
[57:01] one
[57:02] sign in Matthew 17:9 he just keeps going
[57:05] just go straight over to
[57:07] 17:9 he said they came down from the
[57:09] mountain and Jesus charged him saying
[57:11] tell this Vision tell the vision to no
[57:13] man until the son of man be risen again
[57:16] from the
[57:18] dead now that wasn't the first time that
[57:21] was this time end time right amen
[57:24] everybody understand that cuz he said El
[57:26] lias truly shall first come and restore
[57:28] all things John did not restore all
[57:32] things John introduced the Messiah right
[57:36] exactly all right this Prophet this
[57:39] Elijah is to do two things turn the
[57:43] hearts of the children back to the
[57:44] fathers and reveal the Thunders and and
[57:46] the seals coming up through there all
[57:48] right so Jesus was talking about a
[57:50] future
[57:51] event right future event aive
[57:55] truly shall first come amen and restore
[57:58] all things right now the son of man
[58:02] being revealed or raised again in the
[58:04] end time so that's today right that's
[58:07] the sign that's given right a there's no
[58:11] other
[58:12] sign because brother randam said there
[58:15] would be the same as the Bible says
[58:18] there would be signs and wonders
[58:21] given passed out to
[58:23] everyone how you going to tell the
[58:25] difference right right but watch this
[58:28] now we know that Jesus walked to the
[58:32] pool of Bethesda one day and he says I
[58:34] do nothing except the father shows me
[58:36] first right right everybody's looking
[58:38] for the sign will he healed one man
[58:42] yeah and we know in the Scriptures it
[58:45] says in the Book of John that that the
[58:46] many miracles that Jesus did could could
[58:49] not be contained in this
[58:51] book but why didn't they put it in this
[58:53] book
[58:55] why didn't they put in this
[58:57] book cuz we shouldn't need that that's
[59:00] right Gentiles should not need that do
[59:03] you not read in the scripture where
[59:05] Jesus turns to the guy and says the guy
[59:07] says I got a kid that's sick or a
[59:09] servant that's
[59:12] sick what' he say the man say speak the
[59:16] word
[59:18] hallelujah right what kind of sign is
[59:20] that right speak the word John the
[59:26] didn't have one sign or wonder but he
[59:28] identified himself in the word amen now
[59:32] they didn't somebody
[59:34] preach that John was one crying in the
[59:36] wilderness this is where we going to get
[59:38] down to home yeah John did not
[59:42] preach I mean somebody didn't preach
[59:44] John was one John said right that's
[59:48] right John said I'm the voice of one
[59:50] crying in the wilderness in other words
[59:52] he opened the scroll up one day
[59:55] and he identified hisself come on
[59:59] Amen in the word amen that's it he did
[1:00:03] not have a healing
[1:00:05] campaign he knew he was going to
[1:00:07] introduce that Messiah that's right
[1:00:11] Glory
[1:00:13] right was John killed for doing any
[1:00:17] Miracles John was killed for walking up
[1:00:20] and taking care of a marriage and
[1:00:21] divorce
[1:00:22] situation that's right right
[1:00:25] Jesus was not killed for his healing
[1:00:27] campaign
[1:00:29] right he was killed when he said I right
[1:00:34] personal and my father are one
[1:00:37] Hallelujah you are of your father the
[1:00:40] devil and his things you'll
[1:00:45] do
[1:00:47] Hallelujah he's identified himself in
[1:00:49] the word amen amen come
[1:00:52] on living who they they were brought
[1:00:56] them the trouble that's right not signs
[1:00:59] and wonders right living who they were
[1:01:02] think about that right living who they
[1:01:05] were brought the trouble upon them right
[1:01:09] amen
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:15] wow it hits home doesn't it amen but
[1:01:18] after Matthew 17 I believe Jesus did one
[1:01:21] miracle that was recorded he may have
[1:01:25] done more but what did he do after
[1:01:27] Matthew 17 if you have a scull fill
[1:01:29] Bible sometimes just flip through it he
[1:01:33] preached go and look in the Book of Luke
[1:01:36] in Luke 9 no ma Mark 9 and Luke 9 and
[1:01:41] even in John you'll find you'll see John
[1:01:43] doesn't speak of the mount
[1:01:44] Transfiguration but you can see the
[1:01:46] timeline after in John I like the Book
[1:01:51] of John in the Book of John it's about
[1:01:53] in like the fifth or sixth chapter and
[1:01:56] then Jesus starts doing what he starts
[1:01:58] preaching the gospel right you got the
[1:02:01] great John
[1:02:03] 14 that was after Mount
[1:02:06] Transfiguration he preached the word
[1:02:10] amen and let the word back itself up
[1:02:13] right Glory he identified himself in the
[1:02:15] scriptures come on right now I want to
[1:02:19] ask you a
[1:02:20] question does coming to adoption bring
[1:02:23] glorious signs in
[1:02:26] wonders or does the preaching of the
[1:02:29] word amen bring you to
[1:02:33] adoption you tell me amen no no way no
[1:02:36] don't get me wrong I'm not throwing them
[1:02:38] out right I'm not throwing the baby out
[1:02:40] with the bath
[1:02:41] water but I'm saying this is sign
[1:02:44] Seekers we're still on this
[1:02:47] side we ain't got to to to the signs
[1:02:50] following the Believers we're looking at
[1:02:52] at people that want to believe by
[1:02:53] following signs
[1:02:55] but
[1:02:56] look
[1:02:58] Paul he did a lot of Miracles but he did
[1:03:01] a lot of preaching
[1:03:05] right he wrote 80% of the New Testament
[1:03:10] right you can count him on your hand
[1:03:12] almost the Miracles that he
[1:03:15] wrote I'm saying that he wrote cuz we
[1:03:18] cannot take hearsay amen as a gospel
[1:03:22] right amen do you understand
[1:03:25] I know Jesus Christ every day did
[1:03:27] Miracles don't you know don't I'm not
[1:03:29] stupid but this is only the recording
[1:03:32] that has to be a part of me I have to
[1:03:34] identify myself in this word right
[1:03:36] that's what brother Ram said about the
[1:03:38] book of mccabes and all he said sounds
[1:03:39] good right some of it may be true he
[1:03:42] said some of it is not so we can't take
[1:03:44] that as gospel we have to take this as
[1:03:47] gospel that's right okay so if they did
[1:03:49] great signs and wonders which I believe
[1:03:51] they did I want to see the recording
[1:03:53] come on amen this is what's going to
[1:03:55] help
[1:03:56] me right some other people may have a
[1:03:59] good good good uh Doctrine out there a
[1:04:02] good view or a good idea or a concept
[1:04:05] right but brother random was Vindicated
[1:04:08] amen I want to hear a Vindicated person
[1:04:11] amen I believe we got one here amen
[1:04:18] absolutely bless you but Paul was a
[1:04:20] patter Messenger right nice right let me
[1:04:24] ask you a
[1:04:26] question when brother Brandon was doing
[1:04:29] research he come to irenius and polycarp
[1:04:33] right now they both had signs and
[1:04:36] wonders right he said they were real
[1:04:38] close right what separated them amen
[1:04:43] more signs and wonders did did did did
[1:04:46] uh irus do more signs than polyart no no
[1:04:49] he come down to one thing he went right
[1:04:52] back to Paul
[1:04:55] Paul said come out of her my people
[1:04:56] right irenius said come out of her my
[1:04:59] people it was the word that separated
[1:05:01] irenius from polycarp as being the the
[1:05:04] the church age mess so not signs and
[1:05:07] wonders it was what the word said about
[1:05:09] him all right what they said about the
[1:05:11] word I'm sorry what they said about the
[1:05:13] word the message irenius had set him
[1:05:16] apart not the signs and wonders right
[1:05:19] the message he had right then signs and
[1:05:22] wonders followed that
[1:05:24] message all right and we're going to get
[1:05:26] to that we're getting we're getting
[1:05:29] there actually we're about done you're
[1:05:32] doing
[1:05:35] bless
[1:05:37] Luther had signs
[1:05:41] sure but he had a message that just
[1:05:44] shall live by faith
[1:05:47] right Luther really wasn't known for his
[1:05:50] signs and wonders as far as outwardly he
[1:05:52] was known for coming out of the Catholic
[1:05:53] church and just live by faith right okay
[1:05:58] now excuse
[1:06:00] me
[1:06:02] Pentecost you say what what are we going
[1:06:04] to do with
[1:06:05] this don't
[1:06:07] worry if I got it wrote down I got an
[1:06:11] answer Pentecost came to do what brother
[1:06:14] Harris restore the
[1:06:18] gifts which includes signs and
[1:06:21] wonders but not just signs and wonders
[1:06:25] exactly they brought the Holy Ghost back
[1:06:27] into
[1:06:29] power right among the people amen then
[1:06:33] that brought the signs and the Wonders
[1:06:37] amen that's what we got to do Glory we
[1:06:41] got to bring the Holy Ghost Among Us in
[1:06:43] power if we try to do this ourself we're
[1:06:45] going to mess it
[1:06:47] up brother Ram said you go out beyond
[1:06:50] your time he said that's why there's
[1:06:51] scrap heaps of ministers laying on the
[1:06:54] on the side of the road but why did he
[1:06:55] say they were laying on the side of the
[1:06:56] road they went out past God's plan tried
[1:07:00] to make something happen and had a
[1:07:03] wreck out of the will of
[1:07:05] God
[1:07:07] oh so do you want to try to make
[1:07:10] something
[1:07:11] happen now now
[1:07:13] listen Paul even when Paul was in jail
[1:07:17] he was doing something right he wrote
[1:07:20] most of the Bible sitting in jail right
[1:07:23] but he was doing something he was under
[1:07:25] house arrest he wasn't basically in jail
[1:07:28] but he was he couldn't go anywhere
[1:07:30] without an escort and just so happen
[1:07:32] that escort could write so as he would
[1:07:35] say something the escort would write it
[1:07:36] now so God used the whole plan but now
[1:07:40] Pentecost came and restored the gifts
[1:07:42] then the signs and wonders followed them
[1:07:45] right right right amen always the signs
[1:07:50] follow the believer let's turn to First
[1:07:52] Corinthians and we'll be finished in
[1:07:53] just a second
[1:08:01] the reason this thought came to me is
[1:08:04] just to be real honest with you I was
[1:08:07] sitting on a deal stand
[1:08:09] Wednesday morning I guess all the days
[1:08:12] run together I didn't know what day it
[1:08:14] was when we come back all I know is we
[1:08:18] back thank you that was my
[1:08:22] wife
[1:08:25] that could have been an old
[1:08:27] me that was last week First
[1:08:32] Corinthians oh dear I'm going do like I
[1:08:35] told Brother Allan I said Don't Preach
[1:08:36] my sermon again let me do it all right 1
[1:08:40] Corinthians
[1:08:44] 1231 but I sit on a deer stand and I
[1:08:46] thought Lord CU every time I'd call home
[1:08:48] Jun say well we're praying called Danny
[1:08:50] Danny said well we're praying and I know
[1:08:52] you guys were praying that we'd get a
[1:08:54] deer well I thought well Lord why didn't
[1:08:55] you just put one in my
[1:08:58] lap I mean I was getting kind of low you
[1:09:00] got J I was kind of having a pity party
[1:09:02] for myself cuz we had done all this work
[1:09:04] all these years put all these trail
[1:09:05] cameras out put all this you know try to
[1:09:07] get everything done and then we get
[1:09:10] nothing yeah but we didn't get
[1:09:14] nothing because remember character is
[1:09:17] built by
[1:09:18] Battles by
[1:09:21] experience and if we walked out in the
[1:09:22] woods every time shot a deer we'd quit
[1:09:25] going
[1:09:26] y we really would you could going
[1:09:29] wouldn't be any fun
[1:09:31] anymore so the thought came to me it's
[1:09:33] like well
[1:09:34] just if you got what you think you got
[1:09:38] speak the
[1:09:39] word I said okay give daddy a
[1:09:42] deer doesn't matter just give him one
[1:09:44] doesn't make it don't have to be no
[1:09:45] Dimension or you know whatever how big
[1:09:47] it is and it didn't happen well we come
[1:09:50] back in and the thought come to me well
[1:09:52] you don't have what you think you have
[1:09:55] I said that's
[1:09:56] okay and then Wednesday before we were
[1:09:58] getting ready to go to church well I was
[1:09:59] sitting out in the deer stand they were
[1:10:01] getting ready to go to church I went we
[1:10:04] were just a little late we weren't late
[1:10:07] we were just not 30 minutes before
[1:10:09] service but uh but the pastor told me I
[1:10:12] could hunt till dark right so that's
[1:10:15] okay but I was thinking I said Lord you
[1:10:17] know this is just hunting I mean yeah
[1:10:21] God can use a situation and we all think
[1:10:23] that we want to be so spiritual that
[1:10:24] everything we do and that we ask for
[1:10:27] it's got to have some kind of meaning to
[1:10:28] it I'm just hunting I'm enjoying nature
[1:10:33] I'm enjoying the outdoors uh take a take
[1:10:36] a book and read I finish my adoption
[1:10:38] series I reading my books you know and
[1:10:41] you know thanking the lord for what he'
[1:10:42] done and if he give us a de that's fine
[1:10:44] if he didn't I don't worry about it and
[1:10:46] the devil can't stand that cuz that's
[1:10:48] the first thing he does he goes ah see
[1:10:52] there let's read this
[1:10:55] this but covet earnestly the best gift
[1:10:58] now it goes through chapter
[1:11:00] 12 giving out the
[1:11:03] gift all
[1:11:05] right which is
[1:11:07] wisdom Faith
[1:11:10] healing Miracles Aaron went through this
[1:11:12] one time this and he did a good job on
[1:11:14] it prophecy and this is verse 9 and 10
[1:11:17] of 12 you just go through all that Paul
[1:11:19] is bringing a point
[1:11:21] down cuz watch in verse 31 covet
[1:11:24] earnestly the best giftss and yet show I
[1:11:27] unto you a more
[1:11:30] excellent way righten than what those
[1:11:34] gifts amen because gifts and callings
[1:11:37] are without repentance right though I
[1:11:39] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[1:11:42] right and have not charity right I am
[1:11:45] become as a sounding brass or a tinkling
[1:11:47] symbol right and though I have the gift
[1:11:49] of Prophecy and understand all Seven
[1:11:52] Seals
[1:11:57] and
[1:11:59] Thunders and all he says all it right
[1:12:04] right and all
[1:12:06] knowledge and though I have all Faith to
[1:12:09] produce that
[1:12:13] deer you know who I blame
[1:12:17] myself none of you cuz you know that's
[1:12:20] first thought goes to a human mind well
[1:12:22] somebody out there that's praying got
[1:12:23] something wrong with them
[1:12:27] right no I said Mr Dale there's
[1:12:29] something wrong with
[1:12:32] you do we know who we are that's
[1:12:38] it let's don't fake this thing right
[1:12:42] come on you better know where you at
[1:12:43] amen cuz you know what you're going to
[1:12:45] manifest that's what it says in the
[1:12:46] scripture you're going to manifest who
[1:12:47] you are sons of God will manifest your
[1:12:50] yourself but the sons of the devil's
[1:12:51] going to manifest yourself too and have
[1:12:53] not charity I am nothing if I have even
[1:12:55] if I can even take a mountain and pick
[1:12:57] it up and move it that's right and have
[1:12:59] not charity I am nothing that's
[1:13:02] right now I want you to take that word
[1:13:05] charity
[1:13:07] and I don't have time not going to do it
[1:13:09] today but take that word charity and run
[1:13:11] it through amen watch brother brandham
[1:13:14] talk about love that's right as being
[1:13:17] corrective and not the love like you and
[1:13:19] I supposed to have with husband and wife
[1:13:21] love you do you everything goes for good
[1:13:23] no that's not exactly all of Charity
[1:13:26] come on just study it yourself that's
[1:13:28] right right and though I bestow all my
[1:13:31] goods to feed the poor right and though
[1:13:34] I give my body to be burned and have not
[1:13:37] charity it profiteth nothing and then
[1:13:39] Daddy read read the last of it this
[1:13:42] morning right charity suffers long and
[1:13:45] is kind envieth
[1:13:47] not vault is not itself and is not
[1:13:50] puffed
[1:13:52] up
[1:13:55] now let's go back to Romans 8 we'll read
[1:13:58] one scripture we'll be done let me tell
[1:14:00] you a little
[1:14:02] story it's not a story it's true true
[1:14:05] happening uh last month they were
[1:14:08] telling us out in Oklahoma that there
[1:14:10] was a brother came by a priest didn't
[1:14:11] tell us who it was I really don't care
[1:14:13] who it was and uh he gets up after the
[1:14:16] service you know I mean gets up during
[1:14:17] the service and he preaches this message
[1:14:19] and then he comes in and he says he says
[1:14:22] I feel
[1:14:24] the spirit of discernment coming on
[1:14:27] me did you know what the problem with
[1:14:29] the whole thing
[1:14:31] was you didn't use
[1:14:38] it to me that's the problem yeah if you
[1:14:42] take a congregation like this and I tell
[1:14:44] you that I feel a spirit of discernment
[1:14:46] come on
[1:14:47] me and he said I pray Lord that I don't
[1:14:50] use
[1:14:51] it that's exactly words of man said
[1:14:54] that's what they they were telling from
[1:14:55] a person in
[1:14:57] congregation I thought Lord that's kind
[1:14:59] of how I got this message
[1:15:02] here because if we got
[1:15:05] it you better use it yeah if you don't
[1:15:09] have it and say you got it you're in
[1:15:12] trouble amen if that guy stepped up and
[1:15:14] said what he said and he didn't use it I
[1:15:16] doubt he had it the right way because
[1:15:20] this thing is supposed to be that the
[1:15:21] word is a discerner amen of the thoughts
[1:15:24] and intents of the heart not the person
[1:15:26] William Brandon was not a discerner it
[1:15:27] was the word he brought that's right put
[1:15:30] him into a place Hallelujah that the
[1:15:33] word discerned the thoughts and intents
[1:15:35] of the heart William bram's mind he said
[1:15:38] I can't discern you I can't discern what
[1:15:40] you people think but God knows exactly
[1:15:42] what you're thinking today tomorrow the
[1:15:44] next day and two years ago but if a man
[1:15:47] comes and says that that's what brother
[1:15:49] asked me he said should he have said
[1:15:50] that I said well I said I'm not a judge
[1:15:53] of of people but if I would have said
[1:15:58] it and been telling the
[1:16:02] truth it could have used it could have
[1:16:04] been used amen right does everybody
[1:16:07] understand what I'm saying that's what
[1:16:08] I'm saying don't let's don't get this
[1:16:09] thing in trouble where you try to work
[1:16:10] something up right amen try to bring a
[1:16:13] spirit in here it may not be a spirit of
[1:16:15] discernment that's right amen because it
[1:16:17] didn't manifest itself does everybody
[1:16:20] understand what I'm saying now let's
[1:16:21] take that in our life
[1:16:23] do the same thing if God brings you a
[1:16:27] gift and you don't use it it's your
[1:16:29] problem but if a gift comes and you use
[1:16:32] that gift and it's true then that gift
[1:16:34] is from God Amen that sign and that
[1:16:37] wonder is to be
[1:16:38] followed but it's to be checked by what
[1:16:41] first amen the word in the mouth of two
[1:16:44] or three Witnesses am let everything be
[1:16:47] established right Romans 8 here's the
[1:16:52] key
[1:16:56] I didn't read far enough most people
[1:16:58] stop at verse
[1:17:00] 23 let's read 24 and
[1:17:05] 25 for we are saved by hope
[1:17:10] right but
[1:17:11] hope that is
[1:17:14] seen is not hope right it's a reality
[1:17:18] right manifest huh right right right you
[1:17:23] see where this is going
[1:17:27] right one more time you see where this
[1:17:29] is
[1:17:32] going Hallelujah for what a man
[1:17:36] seeth why does he hope for
[1:17:38] it like that man with a gift if he had a
[1:17:41] gift he should have used
[1:17:43] it brother Tom if he had a gift and he
[1:17:46] and that gift become one he should have
[1:17:48] used
[1:17:50] it then it wouldn't have been a hope
[1:17:52] anymore it wouldn't have been well I
[1:17:53] wonder if this guy had something no you
[1:17:56] going to
[1:17:57] know the Bible says you known as you
[1:17:59] known right right in other words you're
[1:18:01] manifesting now what you are listen to
[1:18:05] verse
[1:18:09] 25 let me put this in my
[1:18:13] word but if we can't
[1:18:17] manifest the part of the word we see
[1:18:19] come on are not Quicken to us if we
[1:18:23] cannot manifest it right then do we with
[1:18:28] patience wait for it that's right sir
[1:18:31] you say that's too simple yes sir that's
[1:18:34] exactly what you're supposed to
[1:18:37] do and to me waiting is Discerning
[1:18:40] that's right right the Bible says don't
[1:18:42] put your hand on somebody suddenly right
[1:18:45] what discern right
[1:18:47] right I used to be real quick on the
[1:18:51] trigger not anymore
[1:18:55] sometimes you run your tongue out
[1:18:56] somebody step on it thank
[1:19:01] you but that's the whole thing Paul if
[1:19:05] you'll watch Paul he writes this whole
[1:19:07] letter chapter 8 he's bringing a
[1:19:10] thought to with the Redemption of the
[1:19:12] body right and he
[1:19:15] stops he's like
[1:19:18] okay but that's not all that's
[1:19:21] right because everybody's not going to
[1:19:23] attain to it at the same time that's
[1:19:26] right it's going to develop in others
[1:19:28] quicker than you know can't like walking
[1:19:31] and doing the things um walking and
[1:19:34] talking and all the things that kids do
[1:19:35] some do it so he's coming backing up
[1:19:38] because
[1:19:39] remember up there in verse 15 he says we
[1:19:42] receive the spirit of bondage we won't
[1:19:44] don't receive receive the spirit of
[1:19:45] bondage the Fe but you have received the
[1:19:47] spirit of adoption whereby we cry to
[1:19:48] have a father well that's what he's
[1:19:50] saying in verse 24 because we're saved
[1:19:52] by hope hope which is Faith we're Saved
[1:19:55] By Faith right then all this other's
[1:19:57] coming in but now wait wait if all this
[1:20:00] is not coming at the same
[1:20:04] time then let's keep on
[1:20:06] hoping and
[1:20:08] patiently wait for
[1:20:11] it and it that's why that we must lay
[1:20:14] our rest solemnly on the word of God
[1:20:18] Amen I believe brother boy that this
[1:20:21] word will do what it says I cannot
[1:20:23] believe what I'm going to do everything
[1:20:25] I do is going to be that that's right
[1:20:27] that's right I can't believe every
[1:20:29] feeling and every emotion but I believe
[1:20:31] the word says if we'll do what the word
[1:20:33] says it'll back itself up that's why I
[1:20:37] was trying to get them to see in
[1:20:38] Oklahoma that we were chosen in him
[1:20:39] we're not chosen of ourselves right so
[1:20:43] everything that's done is done inside in
[1:20:45] him in his economy so if we if it comes
[1:20:49] to the place of where we you know
[1:20:50] forsake the S get S together and all
[1:20:52] those things like that if you're outside
[1:20:54] of that then don't think you're going to
[1:20:55] come to this adoption that's right okay
[1:20:58] Paul's saying we're saved by
[1:21:01] hope we're Saved By Faith right in this
[1:21:05] word but there's more oh yeah because
[1:21:09] what's coming we're going to wait for it
[1:21:12] right that's what he's saying right
[1:21:14] that's what he's saying it's coming amen
[1:21:17] it will manifest itself just wait on it
[1:21:20] amen and waiting in Christianity waiting
[1:21:24] is not sitting in a Pew and just going
[1:21:26] to sleep that's right right it's doing
[1:21:29] something right in
[1:21:32] motion the word
[1:21:35] wait means to T right just hang on a
[1:21:40] minute but didn't brother brand say we
[1:21:42] would come to a place that we'd be
[1:21:45] waiting for the revelation of the
[1:21:47] Rapture right amen waiting in a place
[1:21:50] that's not bad then it's not bad to wait
[1:21:54] sometimes you say well you know you got
[1:21:56] these people like I was telling them you
[1:21:57] know there's none good no not one and be
[1:21:59] therefore perfect permissive will
[1:22:01] perfect will we preached all that same
[1:22:04] thing with people they're going to say
[1:22:05] well you know I'd rather have a little
[1:22:07] fire than no fire at all but I want it
[1:22:09] to be the right
[1:22:10] fire and I want it to be the right fire
[1:22:12] at the right
[1:22:14] time and it will because there's going
[1:22:16] to be a predes predestinated group that
[1:22:18] will that's right all right let me read
[1:22:20] you one thing then we'll
[1:22:21] go
[1:22:25] read 2 Thessalonians 2:9 talking about
[1:22:28] the man of sin says even him whose
[1:22:31] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:22:33] with all power and signs and lying
[1:22:36] wonders that's
[1:22:38] right Prophet said Satan can hand out
[1:22:41] Supernatural
[1:22:43] gifts but he cannot handle the word of
[1:22:46] God amen amen he cannot come service by
[1:22:50] Service and bring the word of God
[1:22:53] right somewhere has got to be off that's
[1:22:55] right and it don't have to be off but
[1:22:56] one word that's right that's why we're
[1:22:58] so zealous in this church of all the
[1:23:00] doctrines you say well maybe that won't
[1:23:02] hurt
[1:23:04] you aen probably thought that
[1:23:08] wedge wouldn't hurt anything right
[1:23:11] nobody's going to miss this brother call
[1:23:13] there probably a me of stacked out there
[1:23:15] there's nobody going to miss this
[1:23:17] one it
[1:23:19] destroyed how many of his Brethren yeah
[1:23:22] amen 16 13 there how many died 32 32 he
[1:23:27] killed 32 of his Brethren just because
[1:23:30] not that it was the
[1:23:32] wedge Joshua told him to not God told
[1:23:36] him that's right he said do not bring
[1:23:38] anything into this Camp that's
[1:23:41] wrong same thing with here let's
[1:23:45] stand you love the Lord
[1:23:48] amen I am looking for sign
[1:23:51] amen I see a sign every day when I can
[1:23:55] come to a place that God wants me to be
[1:23:58] that's the greatest sign in the world
[1:23:59] Amen and then one day you know what he's
[1:24:02] going to do he's going to back up what I
[1:24:05] say ain't that right he's going to back
[1:24:07] up amen he's going to back up go back to
[1:24:09] the promise right he promised me I could
[1:24:13] have my children right he promised me
[1:24:15] that I could have a life with a
[1:24:17] wonderful wife and have a good church to
[1:24:19] go to amen he promised me all these
[1:24:22] things in the
[1:24:23] Bible he made a promise that one day
[1:24:25] we're going to stand on this Earth and
[1:24:27] we're going to rule and Rain not with a
[1:24:29] rod of iron that's for God to do in
[1:24:31] judgment right but you and I are going

[1:29:46] Year
[1:29:50] Serv amen let's just read the scripture
[1:29:52] here and then go to the communion from 1
[1:29:56] Corinthians 11:23 for I have received of
[1:29:59] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:30:00] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:30:02] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:30:05] bread when he had given thanks he broke
[1:30:07] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:30:10] which is broken for you this do in
[1:30:11] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:30:14] also he took the cup he up saying this
[1:30:17] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:30:19] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:30:22] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:30:24] eat this bread and drink this cup you to
[1:30:26] sh the Lord's death till he come
[1:30:28] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:30:32] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:30:33] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:30:35] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:30:37] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:30:39] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:30:41] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:30:43] eateth and drinketh dnation to himself
[1:30:46] not Discerning the Lord's life for this
[1:30:48] caus many are weak and sick be among you
[1:30:50] and many sleep right we should judge
[1:30:52] ourselves we should not be or if we
[1:30:55] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:30:58] judged but when we are judged we are
[1:31:01] chasen to the Lord that we should not be
[1:31:03] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:31:05] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:31:07] carry one for another and if any man
[1:31:09] hunger let him meat at home that you
[1:31:12] come not together under condemnation and
[1:31:14] the rest was the rest will I set in
[1:31:17] order when I come let's just have a
[1:31:20] moment of solid
[1:31:22] believing thanking God for all that he's
[1:31:25] done just like brother testifying am you
[1:31:28] know come in they don't get nothing
[1:31:31] brother colie years ago he was up here
[1:31:34] speaking and man broke in his home we
[1:31:39] just asked God to give him the gun back
[1:31:41] man just brought the gun back see I
[1:31:43] believe that God is still
[1:31:46] alive I believe the same one I like what
[1:31:49] the prophet said he said outside of the
[1:31:51] corporal body the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:31:54] here now just like he was before because
[1:31:57] in Hebrews
[1:31:58] 138 what would he be outside of the
[1:32:01] Corporal body see it's it's not here but
[1:32:02] we're the body this is what we're
[1:32:05] talking about but let's just have a

[1:32:43] be held over for but be for your honor
[1:32:46] and Glory so we ask you to sanctify the
[1:32:48] bread because it's a example of Thy Word
[1:32:51] that we lord partake and as we eat this
[1:32:54] bread it goes into our natural body then
[1:32:57] we drank the wine and it stimulates that
[1:33:00] and tomorrow our blood cells are being

[1:33:29] Egypt made it a
[1:33:32] Passover the time you know it was the
[1:33:35] last one you know one day this is going

[1:33:56] just an example what about a good
[1:33:58] example what about the way that God
[1:34:01] would think of this and give us
[1:34:03] this and how much more should we honor
[1:34:06] and respect we seen people healed by
[1:34:09] taking the
[1:34:10] communion so then you know let's believe
