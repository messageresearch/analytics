[27:40] let's go to Revelation
[27:47] 108 It said In The Voice which I heard
[27:50] spaking to me again and said go take the
[27:54] little book which is opened in the hands
[27:55] of the Angel which standed upon the sea
[27:58] and upon the Earth and I went to the
[28:00] angel and said to him give me the little
[28:03] book and he said unto me take it and eat
[28:07] it and it shall make thy belly biller
[28:09] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[28:11] honey and I took the little book out of
[28:13] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[28:16] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[28:19] soon as I had eaten it it became and
[28:24] eating it my belly was bit bitter and he
[28:27] he said unto me th I must prophesy again
[28:30] before many peoples Nations and tongues
[28:33] and kings and you may be seated
[28:37] amen the thing I like to point out here
[28:40] which we know John types the bride
[28:42] that's right and I like what John did he
[28:46] said give it to me said give me the
[28:50] book he didn't have to force it on him
[28:53] he himself wanted it amen and then when
[28:57] when it was replied back to him take it
[28:59] and eat it he didn't say I didn't want
[29:01] it he just took it and he ate it praise
[29:04] the Lord you know I believe that's the
[29:06] type of the Bride of Jesus Christ we

[29:10] us and he don't have to force nothing on
[29:13] us we want it with a free and open heart

[29:36] part that we have to play in this great
[29:38] Plan of Redemption so many people they
[29:41] can preach Revelation 10:7 all day up
[29:43] front backwards crooked sideways all day
[29:46] long but then not seeing Revelation 108
[29:49] which is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[29:51] that's right and he said thou must
[29:52] prophesy again how many of you believe
[29:55] to find the voices in The Bride amen sir
[29:57] I believe that with all my heart which
[29:59] in the time we're living in you can get
[30:00] out kicked out of many pull pit saying
[30:02] that but still it's the truth amen
[30:05] because God got people that he's going
[30:06] to speak through and that is the Bride
[30:08] of Jesus Christ you know I was thinking
[30:11] you know brother Brandon was saying in
[30:13] the message um uh ah can't quite
[30:17] remember the title right off my head oh
[30:19] yeah he said he he said in the message
[30:21] he said let us see come let us let us
[30:24] Ser we would see Jesus brother Bron made
[30:27] a state in the message that was real uh
[30:30] profound to me and I was just thinking
[30:32] about that and he was saying something
[30:36] when God gave Peter the keys to the
[30:38] kingdom and which you know Jesus is not
[30:40] a God is not an Indian giver right when
[30:43] he gave Peter the Kings to keys to the
[30:46] kingdom right Peter was not converted
[30:48] right he was a straight raw hot sinner
[30:52] amen but he gave him the keys right and
[30:55] God is not an Indian giver so it goes to
[30:57] show you even after he gave Peter the
[30:59] keys Peter he you he he cursed he denied
[31:03] him God still didn't take it from him no
[31:05] that's right so that goes to show you
[31:06] brother and sister regardless of what
[31:08] you doing it's not going to change your
[31:09] destiny what God has already
[31:11] pre-ordained for you but you know
[31:14] because Peter had those keys brother
[31:16] Bron begin to make statements and I and
[31:18] I just really just it just kind of just
[31:20] really blew my mind just reading it uh
[31:23] he he said that them Keys was first used
[31:26] on the day of P
[31:28] when Peter preached amen because he had
[31:30] the key he had to open the door on the
[31:33] day of Pentecost because you know Peter
[31:35] what the Bible tells us they went
[31:37] through the same stages that Jesus went
[31:40] through we know that Jesus he came to
[31:42] his own his own received him not and we
[31:45] know that he went to uh the woman at the
[31:47] well amen and then he also went to when
[31:49] the Gentile woman come to him and he
[31:51] told her it's not uh meat to get the
[31:53] children bread the dogs he went through
[31:55] the three races you know which sham and
[31:57] and then the Greeks Jews and Samar
[32:00] he he did the same pattern he said the
[32:02] gospel had to go the same way right so
[32:04] that's why when Peter he used the same
[32:07] pattern that Jesus went through not
[32:09] nothing premeditated it just had to
[32:10] happen and what Peter did when he used
[32:13] that key on the day of Pentecost only he
[32:16] had it he one had to use it is that
[32:19] right and then when he used it they was
[32:21] able to receive the Holy Ghost that's
[32:22] right and then we find out in the
[32:24] scripture uh when Phillip went to the
[32:27] Gentile amen and Philip preached to him
[32:31] you know what brother and sister though
[32:32] philli had a born again experience with
[32:35] God when he went and preached to them
[32:37] they could not receive the Holy Ghost
[32:39] right they couldn't receive the Holy
[32:41] Ghost to Peter came right pet Philip
[32:44] prayed for him he done all he could do
[32:46] for them but they couldn't receive the
[32:48] Holy Ghost so he called Peter Peter
[32:50] turned that key for the Gentiles and
[32:52] they received the Holy Ghost and of
[32:54] course we know then he went to Cornelius
[32:56] and the reason why I'm saying this that
[32:58] right there was in the hands of one man
[33:01] right back there in that day could
[33:02] nobody else do nothing they could preach
[33:05] whatever they want to preach but God was
[33:07] not going to give them the Holy Ghost
[33:08] until that one man used that key to open
[33:11] it up right and you know God done the
[33:13] same thing after Peter used those keys
[33:15] then it was a many member many member
[33:18] bride going out preaching the gospel
[33:20] doing their part because the key was
[33:22] used and that's the same thing today I
[33:24] hear ministers talk about I had a
[33:27] revelation of marriage and divorce
[33:29] before brother brandom did I had a
[33:31] revelation of the serpent seed before
[33:33] brother Brandon did I said I don't
[33:34] believe you because that was given to
[33:36] one man to open that up Revelation 10:7
[33:40] in the days of the voice of the seven
[33:41] Angel when he shall be getting to sound
[33:44] all the mysteries of God shall be as you
[33:46] know you know you know the scripture but
[33:49] you know that's why now he done his part
[33:52] the same as Peter when he done his part
[33:54] it became a many M People now brother
[33:57] Brandon done done his part Malachi for
[33:59] is fulfilled now it's so many member
[34:01] bride you and I we have a part to do
[34:04] it's more than just coming to church
[34:06] hearing brother Samuel hearing Brother D
[34:09] it's more than that it's it's about you
[34:12] identifying yourself in the scriptures
[34:14] you're able to see yourself in this
[34:17] message you're able to see this message
[34:19] being fulfilled in you is that right
[34:21] remember the message can't be
[34:23] denominated but people in the message
[34:25] can be in the denomination
[34:28] praise the Lord they can sit right in
[34:29] church and live a denominational life
[34:31] just like they do out there in the world
[34:33] see it's more than that for you and me
[34:35] the Bible the word is life amen amen and
[34:38] I was I made a statement at my church I
[34:40] said until you come to a place in your
[34:43] life that it bothers you when you don't
[34:46] pray it bothers you when you don't read
[34:49] it bothers you I said you're not going
[34:50] to get nowhere with God this have to
[34:53] become a craving amen and the only way I
[34:56] can give you that craving is the holy
[34:58] spirit because the Holy Ghost feeds off
[35:01] of the word is that right that the same
[35:03] with a woman when she get pregnant amen
[35:06] she begin to Crave things she normally
[35:08] don't crave but the thing of it is it's
[35:10] not her doing the craving it's the child
[35:13] that's inside of her it knows what it
[35:14] needs but it have to receive its craving
[35:17] through the mouth of mother is that
[35:19] right so the same thing with you and me
[35:21] when we got the receive the Holy Ghost
[35:24] God sent us a mouthpiece today to feed
[35:26] our crav he stored up the storehouse he
[35:29] stored up the food for you and I can go
[35:31] gather from it amen so that's why we
[35:34] can't say we're starting right is that
[35:37] right because the food is already been
[35:38] stored up you just got to be willing to
[35:40] do just like J he said give it to me he
[35:43] took the book he ate it give it to me
[35:45] amen and that's where we got to be in
[35:47] this day and hour and say God I want all
[35:49] that you have for me I want it I'm not I
[35:51] don't want nothing less I want
[35:53] everything you have for me is that right
[35:55] but you know say of God uh I see
[35:58] sometimes around the message people are
[36:00] losing their Vision right they're losing
[36:02] the vision of the message amen and
[36:05] getting relaxed go back to an Ephesian
[36:07] stage getting relaxed amen not pressing
[36:09] forward being content be become
[36:12] complacent we can't this not the time in
[36:14] hour to do it it's the time to keep
[36:16] pressing on Amen by the grace of the
[36:18] Lord Jesus Christ I really believe them
[36:21] things with all my heart but I want to
[36:23] talk about you and me our place our
[36:26] position our office what God has called
[36:29] us here to do and us to be cuz we were
[36:31] redeemed for a purpose amen and I want
[36:34] to just read the scripture in Revelation
[36:36] 18 and just bear with me it says right
[36:39] here uh Revelation 1 verse 8 it says I'm
[36:44] sorry I want to go to verse six it says
[36:46] I just start at verse four John to the
[36:48] seven churches which are in Asia Grace
[36:50] be unto you peace from him which is
[36:53] which was and which is to come and from
[36:56] the seven Spirit which are before his
[36:58] throne and from Jesus Christ who is the
[37:00] faithful witness and the first begotten
[37:03] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[37:05] of the earth and until him that loves us
[37:08] washed us from our sins in his own blood
[37:12] here's the verse I want verse six and

[45:31] when we talk about a priest being
[45:34] disqualified I want to put out what is
[45:37] he disqualified from notice right here
[45:40] Leviticus
[45:43] 21:16 and the Lord spake unto Moses
[45:46] saying Speak unto Aaron saying whoever
[45:50] he be of thy seed in their Generations
[45:53] that had a blemish y
[45:56] let him not approach to offer the bread
[45:59] of his God I want you to notice that
[46:03] word offer comes up again now what did I
[46:06] read earlier in the church a book we Are
[46:09] Spiritual Kings to offer that's our job
[46:12] to be here is to offer so we're looking
[46:15] at offering again right here and listen
[46:18] what he said for what whatsoever man he
[46:22] be that have the blemish he shall not
[46:24] approach n going to begin to name the
[46:26] blemishes a blind man a lame he that had
[46:30] a flat nose anything Superfluous or man
[46:33] that is broken footed broken handed
[46:35] crookback dwarf or that have a blemish
[46:37] in his eye or be scurvy or scal or has
[46:41] his Stones broken no man that have a
[46:43] blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest
[46:45] shall come now to offer the offerings of
[46:48] his Lord made by fire he ha a blemish he
[46:52] shall not come n to offer the bread of
[46:54] his God now it Nam the blemishes but
[46:57] notice that word that keep popping up
[47:00] offer offer offer so was he disqualify
[47:04] from all from doing listen to the next
[47:06] verse it says this he shall eat the
[47:09] bread of his God both of the most holy
[47:12] and the holy see what he's disqualified
[47:17] from is offering right but not e right
[47:21] now listen God will let him eat of the
[47:24] Holy right and the most holy permitting
[47:28] him to eat the precious things of God
[47:31] that per man permitting him to eat it
[47:34] but would not let him come and make an
[47:36] offering right amen amen that's right
[47:40] don't you know that applies to you and
[47:41] me right God will not stop you and me
[47:46] from coming to church eating the message
[47:49] of this hour he'll let you eat it he'll
[47:52] let you sing he'll let you testify he'll
[47:55] let you give prais he will not stop you
[47:57] from doing it but what about your
[47:59] offering come on exactly he said who
[48:03] brother b y oh yeah oh yeah amen it's
[48:06] going to get a little bit of tight but
[48:07] it's going to be right I promise you
[48:09] that but I just want to tell you the
[48:10] truth right amen offering now according
[48:14] to what we read in the church a book he
[48:16] redeemed us for a purpose and he want
[48:18] preach to be able to offer but now this
[48:21] guy is disqualified for offering because
[48:23] of his blemishes now if we are
[48:26] disqualified from offering it ruined
[48:28] everything that he said what we supposed
[48:29] to be
[48:30] doing is that right oh ba you said
[48:34] brother I don't know I'll tell you what
[48:36] come with me to Matthew 20 Matthew 5th
[48:39] chapter before we proceed in the
[48:44] further sometimes I think people feel
[48:47] they a been Christians so long who where
[48:50] they can do whatever they want to do oh
[48:51] my say whatever they want to see say
[48:54] have any kind of attitude they want to
[48:55] have and
[48:56] Justified it don't work like that God
[49:00] does God is Holy the holy spirit is
[49:03] timid he will not accept
[49:07] anything amen let's just go ahead and
[49:10] just use the scripture right here
[49:11] Matthew Chapter 5 I want you to notice
[49:13] verse 24 Len how how look listen what
[49:17] Jesus said right 23rd verse therefore
[49:21] thou bring thy gift to The Altar and
[49:23] thou rememberest that th brother have an
[49:26] ALT against thee leave thy gift before
[49:29] the altar Altar and go thy way first to
[49:32] be reconciled to thy brother and then
[49:34] come off with thy gift other words what
[49:37] Jesus is plainly saying until you make
[49:40] that right I don't want your offering
[49:43] right that's it but God I mean I praying
[49:47] I got everything L out a beautiful offer
[49:49] he said
[49:50] so right amen that's the
[49:53] word that's the Bible God said I don't

[50:08] if you even know he got a problem with
[50:10] you right that's a pretty hard scripture

[51:09] about them right because if you gossip
[51:11] about them you plainly saying that's
[51:12] what I want them to do to me right hello

[51:22] like that to each other that's the
[51:23] problem right there you're coming right
[51:25] yeah that's right that's right I'm leave
[51:29] that one
[51:31] alone just get real
[51:39] quiet I want you to watch something go
[51:42] back to Leviticus
[51:49] 21 okay this is really really it's heart
[51:53] searching time that's right right to
[51:55] really make you just say look at you and
[51:59] what I want to point out brothers and
[52:01] sisters you know not condemn nobody but
[52:04] get
[52:05] sing how God is receiving our offering
[52:08] right how God receiving Our Praise right
[52:11] amen cuz you don't accept
[52:13] anything what we going to do in
[52:15] Leviticus 21 we're going to go down
[52:17] through a list of the
[52:19] blemishes you remember I said
[52:21] disqualifying factors which is blemishes
[52:25] right now these preach naturally in the
[52:28] Old Testament if they had any of
[52:31] them any of them blemish physically
[52:34] right they couldn't be they couldn't
[52:36] offer right they can eat all day but
[52:38] they couldn't offer but God want you and
[52:40] here me and here more than just to eat
[52:43] right he want us to be able to offer he
[52:45] want us to be able to stand in the Gap
[52:48] let me just give you a quote for we go
[52:49] on you remember the prophet of God when
[52:50] he told that eror right man he go pray
[52:53] for a man child what did the Lord say
[52:56] you're not worthy you're not fit to lay
[53:00] your hands on this child this man will
[53:02] come a long way for you to pray for the
[53:04] child and you're not fit y he said other
[53:07] words he said I don't want to hear what
[53:10] you got to offer right he said you going
[53:12] to make it right he sir excuse me I got
[53:14] to go make something right he went go
[53:16] make it right came back said the prayer
[53:18] Deliverance right now do that right
[53:20] there means that that don't apply to you
[53:22] and me oh they just for the prophet
[53:24] right right right
[53:25] right no that applies to you and me too
[53:29] because remember he said he's an example
[53:32] every Messenger to each age is an
[53:34] example of the people that live up under
[53:36] that messenger that was an example for
[53:38] you and me God has a a title wrot on you
[53:42] and me than anybody in the face of this
[53:43] Earth righten is that right when you was
[53:46] a sinner a lot of time when we were
[53:48] sinner we live careless life right amen
[53:50] if we didn't pay our bill that didn't
[53:52] bother us but now because you're a
[53:54] Christian something comes up you even L
[53:56] it bothers you right is that right
[53:58] because why you're thinking I don't want
[54:00] to offend nobody I don't want to make no
[54:02] mistake I want to be a perfect example I
[54:04] want to live a life in front of people I
[54:06] want to have a good report I don't want
[54:07] to bring a reproach right see that that
[54:10] makes our conscious and all thing we be
[54:12] conscientious of the things that we do
[54:14] and what we say because we supposed to
[54:15] be living Epistles right amen is that
[54:18] right right can we say praise the Lord
[54:20] praise the Lord but I want you to know
[54:22] we're going to go down we better not get
[54:23] all of them but we're going to walk down
[54:25] through these factors now the first one
[54:28] is a blind
[54:30] man that's pretty
[54:32] easy the blind leave the blind they both
[54:35] going to fall in the ditch right I mean
[54:37] if the man blind how you going to make
[54:38] an offering anyway he might stick his
[54:39] hand in the fire right right right right
[54:42] so I can see naturally why he was
[54:44] disqualified right but now let's take
[54:46] you to the spiritual side spiritual side
[54:49] if we are blind if we are blind how can
[54:53] we Le somebody else right right if you
[54:55] are blind to your own ways you are blind
[54:58] to your faults you're not seeing them
[55:00] how can you Minister and help
[55:03] somebody right brother right spiritual
[55:06] blindness the song that we saw Open the
[55:09] Eyes of My Heart cuz this is what we see
[55:12] from right here Open the Eyes of our
[55:14] heart amen so we can see so blind is
[55:17] friend if you can't not yourself see
[55:20] clearly you're blind you cannot minister
[55:23] right to somebody else right
[55:25] amen right can we go a little further
[55:28] the lame
[55:29] man I want to talk about the lame man
[55:32] for a minute I looked all these things
[55:34] up and I studied them the lame man is a
[55:37] person that was born naturally they
[55:40] might have one leg longer than other
[55:42] right and what it actually means they
[55:44] are unbalanced right they don't have a
[55:46] balance and the Bible tells us in the
[55:48] book of Psalm a lame man is unstable in
[55:51] all of his ways amen but now notice work
[55:55] with the spiritual lame
[55:57] man the natural he don't have a balance
[56:01] but what about the spiritual lame man
[56:04] right let me just talk about him for a
[56:06] minute a person that is spiritual lame
[56:09] they don't have a balance right amen a
[56:11] long leg and a short leg they can lean
[56:14] long in one area but they'll come short
[56:16] in another area they got no balance let
[56:19] me give you an example you get the
[56:21] preacher start preaching he start
[56:23] preaching about Daniel 70 weeks the
[56:25] trumpets and and the vows you get people
[56:27] in the church yeah amen praise the Lord
[56:30] glory to God and then all a sudden he
[56:32] come back the next seron he preach you
[56:34] must be born again
[56:36] ago yeah come on brother that's right
[56:39] Amen to that oh my amen he ain't got no
[56:43] balance right then by the same talking
[56:46] you get the other one sitting there
[56:47] preaching on the fire they send there
[56:50] that just so deep we don't need all of
[56:51] that yeah then he come back he preach on
[56:53] you must be born again amen praise the
[56:56] Lord one them got a
[57:00] balance right come on the Holy Ghost
[57:03] feeds off the
[57:04] word whether you hearing deep whether
[57:07] you're hearing sh right it's C it's the
[57:09] word you say
[57:12] amen
[57:13] amen amen that ain't deep
[57:18] enough ain't deep
[57:20] enough I mean what that mean yeah come
[57:23] on you can't go deeper than no by Soul
[57:26] the Bible tells from my understanding
[57:28] when you are born again you got
[57:30] everything inside of you right there and
[57:32] then you need for the
[57:34] Rapture but you got to grow into a
[57:36] statute of a perfect man I understand
[57:38] all of that but we'll keep growing until
[57:40] my brothers and sisters amen praise the
[57:43] Lord that's just too
[57:45] shallow friends let me tell you I hear
[57:47] if I hear a minister preacher on you
[57:48] must be born again I said glory to God
[57:51] cuz I start thinking about when he touch
[57:52] me amen it still be just that fresh and
[57:55] that much real to me right lame man no
[57:59] balance they got no balance they lean
[58:02] long in one area come short in the of
[58:04] that'll be the one too you get them kind

[58:50] more of them bless come on bring them on

[58:59] factors amen now the next one it said
[59:02] flat
[59:04] nose now flat nose poor fellow naturally
[59:09] he's done but what does that mean
[59:12] spiritually why would God look at a
[59:14] person with a flat nose and say that's
[59:15] it no you can't offer right yeah but
[59:19] when it comes spiritually what does that
[59:21] represent my friends friends when you

[1:03:45] factors
[1:03:46] for old
[1:03:48] crookback this is the one I have a
[1:03:50] problem with right
[1:03:51] here a crook back what it is the person
[1:03:54] with a defected
[1:03:55] spine he has a defect in his spine his
[1:03:58] backbone is deform his character is not
[1:04:01] straight it's crooked he cannot stand up
[1:04:03] straight if you question his stand on
[1:04:04] the gospel he will agree with you then
[1:04:07] he allow the straightway of the Lord to
[1:04:09] be bent just like his back
[1:04:10] bone that's a person they only agree
[1:04:14] according to who they are with right
[1:04:18] right right me and brother D can be
[1:04:20] talking about something a certain
[1:04:22] subject I said Brother D that exactly
[1:04:25] right you ain't nothing but the truth
[1:04:27] then I get brother Samuel we talk about
[1:04:29] the same subject he say something
[1:04:30] contrary to what Dale said and I tell
[1:04:32] Brother Sam that ain't nothing but the
[1:04:34] truth you're exactly
[1:04:37] right so crook back it depends on who he
[1:04:41] or she with how they going to make their
[1:04:45] stand but praise be to God I like to see
[1:04:48] some people they'll stand on what they
[1:04:49] believe regardless who it is when they
[1:04:52] can see it in the word they'll stay
[1:04:53] right there and rightfully divided and
[1:04:56] won't move God vindicate that God

[1:15:01] right and vitamin C is CA Oh I think I

[1:15:08] me and the lack of vitamin C is caused
[1:15:11] by eating a lot of canned goods dried

[1:15:16] lack of fresh food right fresh food have
[1:15:19] plenty of vitamins and minerals a balanc

[1:15:53] put it that way but that's the
[1:15:58] truth and by having the scurvy it causes
[1:16:02] scabs which is the next one yep and you
[1:16:05] know what scabs are scab is a itching
[1:16:07] disease right a festering sorce that's
[1:16:10] what scabs are yeah and the person that
[1:16:14] got scabs they're always iterable oh
[1:16:17] yeah
[1:16:18] uneasy unsettle y very easily to get
[1:16:22] offended yeah
[1:16:24] yeah
[1:16:28] hello oh we got a lot of
[1:16:32] scabs let me tell you something
[1:16:34] friends this is one thing I learned
[1:16:36] about
[1:16:38] life I learned it a hard way but I
[1:16:40] learned it one thing my pastor always
[1:16:43] tell me when we work together we mess up
[1:16:45] on the job sometime things didn't work
[1:16:47] out right did we finally get it fixed he
[1:16:50] said brother B what did we
[1:16:52] learn tell me what we learned right he's
[1:16:54] CU we didn't learn nothing we got to go
[1:16:56] over it again right that's it and that
[1:16:59] ain't nothing but the truth right right
[1:17:02] and one thing I learned since I've been
[1:17:03] pastoring five
[1:17:06] years it depends what's inside of that
[1:17:09] person is how they going to receive your
[1:17:12] counseling make no difference what you
[1:17:15] say how beautifully you put it it
[1:17:18] depends on what's in
[1:17:20] them but if you got a person
[1:17:23] might got all of the problems in the
[1:17:25] world but they just got such a desire to
[1:17:28] be right right right that's the one you
[1:17:30] can deal with right but if you got one
[1:17:32] that got a lot of problems the only
[1:17:34] thing they want to do is talk to you
[1:17:36] about the problem don't want to change
[1:17:38] you might well get ready for four and
[1:17:39] five hours of canceling with
[1:17:43] repeats saying the same thing over over
[1:17:47] that's why you know I think I might just
[1:17:48] do this one day right when I canel a
[1:17:50] certain couple I'm going to write
[1:17:51] everything down write it all down
[1:17:53] everything I say what they say and when
[1:17:55] they come back the next month they walk
[1:17:57] in the offer and say
[1:18:00] here read this right here they say what
[1:18:02] it do I say it's your
[1:18:04] biography cuz you going to say the same
[1:18:06] thing and I'm going to say the same
[1:18:08] thing we're not getting nowhere but when
[1:18:11] you got somebody want to make a change
[1:18:14] but it depends on what's inside of them
[1:18:16] let me give you an
[1:18:20] example me and my son do some demolition
[1:18:23] work in my
[1:18:24] house and uh he had a one of his friends
[1:18:29] with him I told him to go tear a wall
[1:18:31] down let's go tear that wall down I
[1:18:33] didn't show them how to do it cuz I want
[1:18:35] to see what they were going to do you
[1:18:36] got to find out what person is at and
[1:18:38] then you can help them right now you
[1:18:41] know anybody in construction I know you
[1:18:43] in brother Samuel you know and I know
[1:18:45] when you de when you demo a wall a
[1:18:48] drywall you don't go just bust and pull
[1:18:51] little pieces off you just just creating
[1:18:53] a bigger mess it's going to take it
[1:18:54] longer for you to pick it up amen that's
[1:18:57] the only thing you created so but that
[1:18:59] what and and you know what they was
[1:19:00] doing they hitting the wall sweat
[1:19:02] pouring off of them dust flying
[1:19:05] everywhere making a bunch of noise I'm
[1:19:06] just looking at them and all of a sudden
[1:19:08] they got about do much done but they
[1:19:10] just exhausted with a big pile laying in
[1:19:13] the on the floor and I just look there
[1:19:20] and now I got to pick all them little
[1:19:22] pieces up
[1:19:23] I said all right I said come here what I
[1:19:26] did I found where Jo was right I just
[1:19:29] got my saws
[1:19:31] all right went right beside the Jo stick
[1:19:35] my fingers behind it and I just
[1:19:38] start see big old peie come out I picked
[1:19:42] it up I sat it down and I was
[1:19:45] like no
[1:19:49] sweat all I got to do now just pick it
[1:19:52] up and chunk it on the power now they
[1:19:53] got to get
[1:19:56] sh I said
[1:19:58] son I said work
[1:20:01] smarter not harder right and because he
[1:20:05] wanted to learn you know what he said he
[1:20:07] said Oh Daddy I
[1:20:10] see but you know what if my son already
[1:20:14] got complexes in his
[1:20:17] heart uh no self-esteem already just
[1:20:20] feeling down about himself when I made
[1:20:23] if he was feeling that way and if I
[1:20:25] would have made that statement work
[1:20:27] smarter not harder you know what he
[1:20:28] would have repli you just call me dumb
[1:20:31] no I didn't right that's the way you
[1:20:34] received it because what you already in
[1:20:36] you what you going through I did not
[1:20:38] call you that
[1:20:40] amen right see it depends on what's in
[1:20:42] that person how they going to receive
[1:20:44] that's why I one say he called me a
[1:20:46] buzzer I'm saying he called
[1:20:49] me Amen on what you're going through
[1:20:52] what's in your
[1:20:54] heart
[1:20:56] bless brother bless the Lord we're
[1:21:00] almost done that's all right good
[1:21:03] scab another thing about
[1:21:06] scab it also represents
[1:21:10] unforgiveness
[1:21:13] bitterness that's another thing scab
[1:21:15] causes unforgiveness and bitterness and
[1:21:19] that's one of the things I
[1:21:21] find so many saints of God it's an
[1:21:25] unforgiving
[1:21:26] spirit and they know very well Jesus
[1:21:29] said if you don't forgive that's right
[1:21:32] neither will your father in Heaven
[1:21:33] forgive they know it very well right
[1:21:38] Unforgiven I remember what you done to
[1:21:40] me

[1:30:32] going on y'all can deal with it go out
[1:30:34] on the
[1:30:37] head oh yeah I told her
[1:30:39] that praise the Lord the Bible say when
[1:30:43] a man join to when a man
[1:30:46] leave his mother and
[1:30:49] father leave he said leave and he said I
[1:30:53] hang around
[1:30:55] leave I told my children I do not train
[1:30:57] you to stay home I train you to
[1:31:00] leave that's right that's what I do we
[1:31:03] train you to leave right and I hope you
[1:31:06] get the Holy Ghost then
[1:31:07] leave show me a scripture where a girl
[1:31:10] can leave home and she ain't get
[1:31:15] married come on it ain't
[1:31:19] one right
[1:31:22] some girl like you so you telling me I'm
[1:31:25] stuck here guess what if you got the
[1:31:27] Holy Ghost your parent got the Holy
[1:31:28] Ghost you'll be happy to be stuck
[1:31:30] there because you do not realize what's
[1:31:33] going on out there that's marriage and
[1:31:36] divorce should never even have to be
[1:31:39] mentioned amongst our Young Generation
[1:31:41] that's right exactly she even have to be
[1:31:44] mentioned that's right but look at all
[1:31:46] the young people in the message getting
[1:31:49] divorced but say he choosing the bride
[1:31:51] why is this so it's because people has
[1:31:53] gotten away from
[1:31:56] God that's what he said praise the Lord
[1:32:00] Jesus the last one is the broken Stone
[1:32:03] our this here A lot of people don't like
[1:32:05] to mess with it but it still is the
[1:32:08] word I'm not afraid to mess with it cuz
[1:32:10] I understand what it means naturally
[1:32:13] what broken Stones is if a man cannot
[1:32:16] produce children right right he cannot
[1:32:19] offer right now what they got to do with
[1:32:21] us spiritually
[1:32:23] right now I heard some preachers
[1:32:27] preach if a minister ain't got the Holy
[1:32:29] Ghost if Pastor ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:32] can't nobody in this congregation get it
[1:32:34] I have to disagree with that and I want
[1:32:37] to tell you why reason why I disagree
[1:32:39] with that because of what he said and KN
[1:32:40] it one in time a man can preach you a
[1:32:43] Holy Ghost full of message and yet he
[1:32:45] himself be lost oh my that's right oh my
[1:32:49] thank you he sure can well let me read
[1:32:51] about the broken Stones I didn't mean to
[1:32:53] put that
[1:32:54] up bless cuz even Paul himself said he
[1:32:59] said there's many instructors but few
[1:33:01] fathers right right right right right so
[1:33:06] broken Stones this deals with all of us
[1:33:09] right he says in church book the order
[1:33:11] of the temple servant is very revealing
[1:33:13] they are first of all priest who was
[1:33:15] Unix the sterile priesthood PRI the
[1:33:20] sterility the St of a people who Drift
[1:33:23] from the word for a people who claim to
[1:33:26] know God apart from the word are bearing
[1:33:29] a life as a sterile unit right y hello
[1:33:34] amen that's you say what that mean that
[1:33:37] means this right here and you say you
[1:33:38] loving God and serving God but the word
[1:33:41] ain't there right you're bar right you
[1:33:44] will you won't bring forth life you
[1:33:47] can't bring forth life cuz the word is
[1:33:49] just a seed but you're going to need the
[1:33:51] spirit the water that seed to bring
[1:33:53] forth
[1:33:54] fruit that's right that's why we worship
[1:33:56] God in spirit and truth you can't
[1:34:00] separate spirit and truth no more you
[1:34:02] can oil and wine right they all run
[1:34:05] together praise the Lord that's right
[1:34:08] that's why friends we want birth to take
[1:34:10] place we bring an atmosphere that's it
[1:34:13] it creates an atmosphere right somebody
[1:34:16] might need Deliverance create the right
[1:34:17] atmosphere they can receive the
[1:34:19] Deliverance even as the word is going
[1:34:20] forth
[1:34:22] we got a job to do amen we have a job to
[1:34:25] do amen disqualifying
[1:34:28] factors what about your
[1:34:30] offerings right come on is your heart
[1:34:34] condemned or is it free right what about
[1:34:37] your
[1:34:39] offering I tell you what I screamed out
[1:34:42] through the
[1:34:44] years to the young people preaching my
[1:34:46] heart out preaching preaching preaching
