========================================

all right God bless you my brothers and sisters try to see if we can get this me see blinking off and on okay give us a minute I'm trying to see if we can get this it's blinking like that it's blinking oh yeah let's not do okay all right we're trying to get us hooked up here but uh we'll go back to the old school way I guess well God bless everybody certainly uh privilege to be be back with you all once again and uh you came back for more all right so let's buckle up by the grace of the Lord and let's go to the Lord in prayer as they get get it turned on precious Lord Jesus we thank you Father Lord just for this opportunity once again Lord uh to stand behind this desk Lord Jesus and just present this Sunday school lesson I pray you touch every heart Lord just uh bless your children Lord Jesus as we we learn about you father God and bless this whole day Lord the services Lord May our hearts be prepared Lord to worship you to hear from Heaven Lord Jesus we thank you Lord for this opportunity Lord bless our brothers Lord just around the world Lord traveling and those on the mission trip and bless us now father we commit it in your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord so Financial Jubilee fighting to believe part six and um definitely you know this is um certainly a a a fight you know we started last time and it's all about fighting to believe and Jubilee as we know that word is about freedom and although we say Financial Jubilee I hope by now you're seeing that we're really talking about the freedom that Christ gives all of us you know to make us whole to to Deliver Us from any type of bondage that we are in we go to the next slide my brothers and Jubilee I I love this quote it says no matter how long they had been in bondage or how long they were supposed to stay there when the year come of Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free and I just love that if you take a minute just to look at those words you know no no matter how long you've been in bondage so if we just use Financial Jubilee as just a a a a map it's a symbol it's just something small that we all can relate to as we work we earn money we get new jobs we save we buy we spend just something small that we can hold on to that we all can relate to as we look at these greater promises that God has for us and so no long no matter how long we've been how long we've handle money I mean some of it is generational for me it was generational from history and history and history that I grew up not knowing any clue how to handle any type of money all we knew you get money we buy candy that's what we started out with that's all we had ask my dad for a dime and a penny I knew you needed a penny for tax and that was about it we could buy a dime worth of candy and that's pretty much how my journey with money started and it no matter how long you were supposed to be there how long you were supposed to stay that way as I got older and and finally got my my mortgage and man I thought I was living it up you know I took every dime and I try to get the biggest house that we could possibly get this was in Maryland and to the Max and they they had you know of course 10 year loan 15year loans 30-year loans were the normal I got me a 40-year loan and I thought I was my goodness and was thinking about the Next Generation loans you can pass it to your kids after you leave but thank God we stopped at 40 but praise the Lord when I when the trumpet sounded that stopped me in my track I asked the Lord what happened and he started revealing to me all about this Jubilee so every man could go free if he wanted to go free by the grace of the Lord Jesus go to the next slide so it's cleaning up our lives you know as we look at our prophet and what he says pay your debts owe no man get all things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen amen so it's about cleaning up our lives getting ourselves ready and remember it's a fight it's a fight that we're trying to win at we're trying to win at something go to the next slide brothers and I brought this out last time and it says that's the way it is with human life you can't play the rules of the game of Life wrong and expect to win so I hope we're all here trying to win we're trying to win something I know by the grace of the Lord I'm trying to win I'm trying to win something you know whether you're playing sports or anything in this life Journey it's about winning so love this quote because it we can relate we're trying to win we're trying to win with our families we're trying to win in our marriages we're trying to win in our homes we want to do things right any any young couple young person starting out I mean you thinking about marrying PR Prince Charming and Princess charming and oh life is going to be at ease you're going to get the job oh it's going to be perfect but somehow along the journey you realize oh my I need some help but by the grace of the lord we we have the word of God that gives us the rules to play by and if we expect to win we got to play according to the rules the ru book has been here my brothers and sisters it's been here all of our Lives since we all were born that word of God has been there and many of us with the prophet of God since we were here it's born in 1978 Prophet was well off the scene all the tapes were recorded at that time and the same word now there are so many people that does doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life and especially in the day that we now live people just seem to think that all they have to do is keep up with someone else with the Fashions of this world with the enticements of this world and with the enticements that the world has given to them that's right and and we just you know we set our bar to what everybody else is doing you know and um there's another quote I won't bring won't putting on the screen but brother B said it's so many different angles and there so many different angles in this day and time that he said we hardly know what to do you know you got so many voices so many screenshots so many oh it it you we need God's word and we have to fight to hold on what is right by the grace of the Lord came across a testimony brother Joe shared it and I thought I would bring it up and just read it out brother Terry Tidwell we can bring to the next screen just a wonderful testimony but I I want to bring in the context what what are we fighting for what are we fighting for in this testimony as I thought about financial Jubilee just kind of brought me to some thoughts but I want to just actually read the the testimony for you and so I I know these are small prints so you don't have to try to read it but I'll read it it says as many of you know this is Brother Terry Tidwell he said I was the youngest of six kids I was told I just kind of slipped in there my parents were not planning to have any more kids after the five they had but I had to be born we lived in this house near Franklin Tennessee we had no running water no phone no Plumbing my my dad worked and preached trying to keep food on our table while also trying to feed the lost it was a rainy afternoon I was 4 or 5 and the oldest was around 10 and being stuck inside we were all getting on Mom's nerves with only two rooms to play in mom suggested that we get down on our knees and pray that the Lord would send my brother and sister a pair of shoes since they didn't have any for church the next day what started as a sweet gesture was a defining moment in my life together in the living room all six of us kids huddled together to pray that the Lord would send shoes for my brother and sister so they could go to church the next morning it was late in the afternoon on that long summer day when a car came slowly rolling down our country road a knock at the door revealed brother and sister Gibson who lived 40 mil away standing there with bags in their hands Brother Gibson in his quiet manner explained to Mama that while he was praying today the Holy Ghost spoke to him and and said go buy shoes for your children as six Small Faces were fastened upon the preacher Mama began to cry out of those bags came not just two but six little boxes of brand new shoes for months afterwards mama would pray over and poish all six pair of shoes on Saturday night before church on Sunday thanking God for answering prayer praise the Lord what a testimony my goodness by the grace of the Lord so when you look at that and I just want to update this not change the testimony but I want to tell you what what we deal with and certainly for the modern generation flip the next slide bring up ads for coals so if we look at that testimony what's happening now it would be a little different mama would probably be worried about the kids needing shoes Co ad would show up 30% off with a credit card mom would be like okay I'm going to go down and get some pair of shoes she would go get the shoes on credit get her 30% off but they needed a coat also so she would go and get some coats for him as well putting on credits only $5 more dollars a month what's a big deal she also needed a pair of shoes too so she got her three pair of shoes and she like that bracelet as well because she deserved it you know she'd been working hard and she might as well get her husband a gift too while she's at it that's going to go up to $8 more a month hey let's go ahead and do it but his birthday is coming up as well so she's going to go and get his birthday present on credit also that's only $13 more dollars a month and she's going to take it all home when Jimmy sees the shoes he didn't want those pair of shoes because he wanted some Nikes he didn't want Adidas so now he breaks down into a tantrum and he's crying she's upset dad gets home it's like man why you buy all this stuff well it's only $18 a month why are you complaining and I got your gift but now he's depressed he's sad because she spent too much money that he didn't have and there you go now they're arguing they're mad with all this stuff on the desk all the stuff on the table and nothing has been learned they have been cursed by what should have been a blessing and they never got an opportunity to see what God can do yeah that's what the devil's trying to do to us it's all a gimmick you heard the quote brother bam talking about cigarettes saying it's all a gimmick well it's the same thing that's what the devil's trying to do he's trying to weaken our faith so we can never obtain to what God wants for us we don't know how to depend on him we don't know how to ask for him we don't know how to wait for him and that's what it's all about and Satan can get in there and mes mess us up regardless of where you are in your life then he knows he can have that pattern for the rest of your life and the last thing you're doing is trying to wait on God when you have all access to everything you need we don't wait on the Lord we just go out and we do and this is what God has trying to help us to slow down to back up to learn his principles and standards so we can get to the true true Riches of God go to the next slide as we've talked about the principles and I'm just going to run through these These are the principles that we should be thinking about on a day-to-day basis God owns everything he is our father we are the bride of Christ or we should be so we should be waiting on our husband who already promises he can supply all of our needs he has promised that we have it in the word he owns it all but we have to manage what he gives us very diligently remember money cost your time I don't care if you're borrowing it I don't care what it is something has to pay for that and the only thing that's going to pay for that is your your time your life we have to be patient we have to avoid debt like a curse we have to save we have to watch the ants learn from them and remember the best investment is giving but we need to be in a position where we can give freely and remember godliness with contentment is a great gain great gain and that's the desire that's we're after we're after that that great gain so we're talking about how to fight and and fighting again remember God has these promises for us financially within our marriage within our every he has all of the examples for us but we have to fight the next slide he says now the people today are expecting expecting sorry now remember God gave them the land down in Egypt said the land is yours every bit of it now the people today are expecting God to reach down get them by the neck say yes that's right you bring me out clean me off heal me and I'll believe you God doesn't do his business that way he G gives you the promise remember we have that word we have the promises but you have to go fight for every inch of ground that you have to fight for every inch of ground that you possess and we always know this this scripture that is very well known here second peter4 whereby are given unto exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so we have all these promises and Israel is a great example for us to see God made the promise but you have to fight for it so everything I've been talking about just Financial Jubilee it's something you're going to have to fight for but it's yours all of these promises that we hear they're ours but we're going to have to fight for it we can't expect it to be delivered to us and I know brother Dale always brings out and he said for a long time you know many in this message is not going to make the Rapture and that's sad because we're expecting that it's just going to be be given instead of fighting for this fighting for the promises God called us to be examples that's what he did for Israel they were just to be an example so other nations could see a nation that could follow God it had nothing to do with whether they're going to be rich poor David Solomon they had great riches but he was looking for a nation that could be example in everything he wanted them to be the head not the tail he made it very clear they would be the ones lending to Nations not the one borrowing so how much more of an example God wants for us in this last day the end time we're at the end of the whole game but we know how to win we know what we should be winning we know but we're expecting it different why because the devil has gimmicks he has all of these gimmicks for us go to the next slide and this this quote just my goodness this this just almost blew me away you know as I was looking at this yesterday he said now remember God gave them the land down in Egypt that land is yours every bit of it now the people today are expecting I'm sorry did I go to that to the next one he said if you've got a shadow of a power of God in you you got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are my goodness do do we believe that I mean do we really believe we could actually go speak a world with ocean land Seas into existence and go live on it well I do I believe we do but I don't believe it's going to be something we're going to just G to show up one morning and you're GNA have that kind of power no no no no if we can't save $500 for an emergency fund then I think we need to back up a little bit make sure we can start creating something where we can see God move where we can have testimonies of God moving in every area of our life to get to where we can step into this kind of power where we can raise the dead we can get people out of the graves for a resurrection that we've heard so much about but brothers and sisters I don't believe it's just going to show up one morning and we don't have the character to do it so God is trying to get us to that point where we have something we can continue to step one step at a time to reach this kind of power yes this is not just a myth he's saying with the Holy Spirit we have that kind of power that's what power is in the church now but it's controlled by a law it's a law of Faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place The Souls of your foot can set upon now notice is that you can set upon if you can't set there to create a world it's not going to happen if we can't set to save for an emergency fund if we can't set our foot to I can buy a car with cash brothers and sisters we're falling for the gimmicks we're falling for the tricks because you get a character as you build as you save as you wait on the Lord you get to see him just as brother Terry Tidwell brought out it was a defining moment in his life to see God answer that prayer that set a foundation of faith in a young boy and the same thing we should be able to do by the grace of the Lord set examples for our children for our families for our friends for our co-workers for everything that we do but this is not easy it's not it is a fight and if we can just do Little Things by the grace of the Lord knowing what is the prize knowing every day brother Wade and brother Dale and the brothers just sacrificing bringing us this these promises they're bringing us the promises 50 years we know brother D pre bringing these promises but oh God we have to be able to step into it can we rise to the faith or are we just hearing things so that's what theour is if we could take a small thing that don't matter how young you are where you are in your journey if you can start saving a little bit to say Lord I'm going to have to wait on you I'm going to have to sacrifice Lord and way I know I want it and I see a way I can get it my way or the way the world tells me through this gimmick but Lord God let me hold on just for a little longer father I do need this Lord but I don't have the money to do it I I don't have the money to do it so Lord God I'm going to need you to supply okay because when he does give you the money he still needs you to wait on him we just can't do whatever we want to because it's all his and that becomes a difficult responsibility when you have children you got family and it's like Lord what would you want me to do I can do this father but I want to be led by you but I want to be in a position Lord if you speak to me like Brother Gibson says go buy those kids shoes you're in a position he doesn't break out his credit card and says Ah I'm going to get him shoes and a coat too no no no no no God supplies God works on all Avenue he says if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you that power it's with you all the time but he says your faith gets away from it but it's still there so my what power do we have with this word of God in the end of the end times we are here with such power such promises but we're going to have to fight my brothers and sisters fight let's go to the next slide fight fight fight but Moses Joshua and the Israelites had to fight for every inch and every promise in the book is yours but God will never give it to you and you lay back on a bed of ease that's what his brother BR this is his quote he'll never give it to you you'll fight for every inch you get that's it fight for every inch things are handed to you that's what the matter with the American people tonight you've got everything handed to you wellfed fattened and clothed and everything so you think the devil doesn't know that you don't think he has set this thing up he's designed this thing it is the most fantastic marketing scheme in the end time that we're facing right now internet the devil he has it for free oh we are influen infuencing one another we are just all in trying to keep up with everybody else the devil has this design because he knows if we can get to where things are handed to us we don't know how to fight and he know we will never even get close to these promises that God has promised for us go to the next slide as we're kind of winding up and and this is what ended up you ended up with people that was holding on to God God's promis hand and those who couldn't even get close you had Caleb he steal the people he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able well able to do it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against his people for they are stronger than we so that's what we're talking about that's where we're in as our faith gets weakened and we can't get to these promises we're hearing these things if we don't have that those patterns we don't have the the strength we haven't built up you can't run a marathon my brothers and sisters I know I couldn't unless I practice you know so this is greater than a marathon so there's no way unless we practice every single day every single hour everything that we're doing asking God to be with us and go guide us on this journey amen so we can get to where these promises as they become more of a reality in our lives we're not like the other 10 that said we're not able to go up we know we're able to go up because we've seen move we have so many areas in our life so many testimonies just stacked up on one another in our own life our own experience that we're like no the same God that I serve he can do this the same God that I know he can do this let's go to the next slide let's go we'll skip to the next one after this keep going so we have to put on the whole armor of God that we can stand against the Ws of the devil we have to have the whole armor of God and that's why we're here today to get equipped to hear the word to get the whole armor of God in our mental mind and our physical strength and our decisions to wait on God to be courageous to be strong all those things promised in Joshua we got to be strong we got to wait on the Lord all those kind of things and we got to have this full armor of God every day so we can stand against the Ws of the devil I just want to bring out one of the Ws of the devil because I've been spending some time in in Moses with Moses and the children of Israel and Bam go to the next slide you know bam he tried his best to curse the the children of Israel he couldn't do it he finally realized he couldn't do it the scripture end up saying for they vexed you with when God told Moses finally to go down there and wipe out the midianites he says for they have vexed you with their vows wherewith they have beg galed you in the matter of pure that's what God finally told Moses go down and wipe them out because they have Vex you with their WS with their gimmicks with their tricks what was this trick what was this trick that they ended up pulling off he could not bam couldn't curse him so what he came up with was hey we're just going to have a big party and invite him to a party that was the gimmick brother RM said they got up there they started seeing all of these fancy things all of these women half naked and it was like Wow Wow and they compromised they compromised and that's how they end up falling couldn't curse them they end up cursing them El so Satan knows he can't get get us with all of these different things that you know we've gotten away from in the world many of us drinking smoking all those kind of things but ah if he can get us with little gimmicks just go the way of the world don't wait on the Lord find a way there's an easier way there's a we don't have to wait on anything it's free just figure out something the way the world has it designed we will never see God move in our life but we will have what we think we needed we will have these things but not realizing that our faith has been weakened we're just listening to things that we don't even believe is possible when God wants to show us there is nothing nothing impossible for God you know the world is full of all these advertisement I has this little ad with this little girl that says using your first credit card wisely she's probably about 10 years old promise you if she was wise she wouldn't have that no and I got this other little thing that was pretty funny to me said I'm A Jones try to keep up that social media world you see and all the Jones everybody I'm a Jones keep up with me keep up with me and we're striving we're fighting going the way of the world versus fighting to wait on God to have him move so we can get to this freedom because remember Jubilee we're saying Financial Jubilee but I hope by now you're realizing it's God just really saying hey it's time for us time for us to be free in Christ free from Indie bondage oh it's Grace and his freedom and that's the wonderful thing about God that's that's what I I have experienced is Grace and his freedom regardless of the mistakes regardless of all of that no matter how long we've been no how long we supposed to be God can make us free so I pray God bless you I pray you hold on to these things let's fight for our freedom in Christ amen so we can truly truly get to all these precious promises certainly see all the young couples and the couples starting out hey fight fight now fight now I promise you if you talk to any couple older they would say fight fight when you're younger fight for your marriage fight for your finances fight to be that example God has given you so much potential by the grace of the Lord to be in this word all of us we have so much potential and I pray God will continue to bless us all the musicians can come on up God bless you and be [Applause] blessed for
