mouth with arguments I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me will he plead against me with his great power no he would put strength in me amen there the righteous might dispute with him so should I be delivered forever from my judge behold I go forward but he is not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot Behold Him He hideth himself on the right hand that I cannot see him but he knoweth the way that I take when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold my H my foot hath held his steps his way have I kept and not declined neither have I gone back from the Commandments of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food amen God bless you this evening you can be seated I want take a little thought tonight and try not to be lengthy but I want to think just take this little thought God's way and uh you know Jesus said in in John chapter 14 you know Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me and the message identification Christ of all ages brother R says a man he knows he comes from the Beyond and a dark shadowy curtain that hangs between him and where he was before he comes here and he knows he must go behind that curtain and he has always wanting to know where he come from and what he is and where he's going he said we have millions of volumes that's been wrot I suppose on the subject but there is only one book and that's 66 volumes in itself that can tell you where you come from who you are where you're going and that is this Bible it's the word that tells you where you come from who you are and where you're going and uh I I just want to take a little thought and just look at a few things tonight but um you know God has given us his word to lead us and you know when when we realize that where we come from and you know as brother brandham said before God was God you know he was eternal he was Elohim you know he dealt dwelt alone with all of his attributes and he had all this that he wanted to express he wanted to express his word and you know he began to condescend and began to express these things and said let there be and be to create all these things everything that he he created that was in his mind everything that came was created and it was created in the way that he wanted it to come everything came in a divine order and there was a there was a process that he had and he began to speak and he had these great thoughts and he began to lay all these things out and he thought of you and I and he knew that because we were a part of him and brother BR said that's the reason that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world because we were in his thinking we were a part of God and so we we were a part of that he said that great Master intelligence that began to set everything in a divine order everything came into existence is set in in the right way and there's you know when you look at the when brother R was talking about the moon and the stars and the solar system and you look at all the things that are in in set in order and you look at this the vast solar systems and galaxies and everything how everything works and you know you know man has tried to build a clock and tried to come up with a way that they could keep time and you know God set a solar system just by speaking it because it was his thoughts he set everything in motion and even today we go back and look through history and we can see how the Stars the planets line up we know when these things took place what happened all of these things and it was just because God had all this in his plan he set it all up and we're still using that today because we can see how all these things take place and know what's going to come in the future by because it works such a such has such order to it that everything works exactly and nothing's out of cater and it all works the same and you know it's amazing and then we see these great great men have great intelligence they they spend their life studying these things and looking through great telescopes and understanding all these things that are uh way over my head but you know you you think of all this and they look at all these things and say there is no God there is there is no God and you know brother BR said that a man walk over a blade of grass and not understand where it come from or how it came into being and and all these things and not realize it was a creator that set all these things in motion and created us and set us where we are today and had all this thing and set up in a in a divine order and everything works just the way God wants it to there's nothing out of cater but sometimes we realize that you know when God created man and he created man in his own image when all of these things were set in order and when he began to create all these things when it come into that divine order you know God set you as created Adam and Eve set them in the garden and gave them dominion over the over the Earth and all those things that he said because he said well let us make man in our own image and after our likeness and he had dominion over all the over everything he was able to speak and do what he wanted to with it because he had control of it and God had given him this power had do it because he was the son of God and he set all these things in motion for for a for a reason for to express himself and if we understand that God said all these things in motion and said from the beginning everything came in a divine order and we realize that it's still the the order is still there amen God's still in control as we were talking about last time everything still work just the way God set it up and because you know God didn't lose control of anything and if he and if he set anything in order and it said has power and this order has been started then when as Paul says here in Romans 8 you know he says who can separate us from the love of God because if God set this in order and as we look at at through the scriptures here he says so tribulation or distress persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword he said that is written if for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter he said nay in all things we are made more than conquerors through him that loved us he said for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so we realize that when God set all these things in in motion and he set everything in order and he gave man dominion over the over the Earth and everything that was upon the Earth and and had dominion over could rule it because that's what God wanted to have he wanted to have someone that could have dominion that he could work through that had control and he gave it and he gave it to Adam and we know that when when he set Adam and Eve out there he he knew what was going to take place but you know he was he was so gracious because he put them on free moral agency and allowed them to do what they wanted to do and give them the opportunity but he knew what was going to take place so when he when he allowed that to take place he knew what was going to take place and he knew that the fall was going to take place because he knew that when Eve began to listen to the Ser Serpent's sermon when when he began to have fellowship with the serpent she was going to take the word that was not right she was going to take a word that was not right when she had had when she had heard the word and she everything was in in divine order everything was in Divine motion and everything was just perfect and then when she began to hear something what God had already told them listen don't partake of that because in that is death that will that will not take you to anything but death it will take you exactly out of the place that you're in right now it would it would take you right out of the garden everything would be in chaos but all of a sudden she wanted to be she wanted to hear something that that she thought might put her closer but she didn't realize she was in the place that God wanted her to be she was in the place that God wanted her to be and she began to listen to The Serpent's word you know as he began to speak to her oh you know if if you'll be just like God if you'll just listen to this how wonderful it is and and she began to listen to this and she bought his lie and she committed an act and here was Adam that took part of the same thing right and turned his back on God and walked right out of the garden God put him out but you know he L he loved Eve but you know you know they they God knew what was going to take place but they walked away from the word they turned their back on him and you know it's the same way with you and I God has given us his word but you know it takes the same thing is that we have to take What God Says whether we like it or not whether fit you know and you know they here they are and they go through this and as one of the brothers was speaking you know talking about um Cain and Abel and you know here they are God began to speak to them outside the garden and here it was when they begin to talk about what was going to take place brother Wade was talking about that you know when you're talking about what took place and understanding what their re reation was when God gave Cain the opportunity when Abel had a revelation from god of what it was going to require and he went out and had done exactly what paid the made the sacrifice exactly what God had told him to do and he walked right out there and no doubt Cain had had to heard the same message preached to him had the same understanding but when God came to and stand in front of Cain and began to speak to him and and you know direct me message directly to Cain and told him listen you don't have to have a revelation but the one thing that's going to require that's going to be required of you more than anything is you're going to have to have obedience and it's what's required if you're going to have to obey the word that's what it takes full obedience what brother R say full obedience to the word entitles you to the Token it takes a full obedience to the word and exactly what but what did he do he turned it down he had his opportunity God not God's not an Indian giver God God's not a Shyer God's God's not some trickster but he gave everybody the opportunity but somewhere along the way you're going to turn God down because as as brother Wade was speaking you know God God was meant to speak to can and made it made the opportunity give him the offer but he's the one that turned it down and he's the one that walked away from God but God give him the opportunity uh to make it make his way known and then after the fall and we know how all how all these things took place and and Cain walked away and man began to seek the face of God but you know in in course of time you know we know that uh Man became more wicked and all the things that took place in the earth but you know there was always God was always reaching out to man he was always trying to find a way to back to to bring man back into fellowship and you know when when the Wicked Rose up and how the Earth got so wicked that God couldn't even stand the Earth but you know what he brought a message to man named Noah and he began to speak to Noah and tell him listen I'm going to give you a message to the people because listen there is there is a message of mercy and grace to the people listen because you know what it's not going to stand the way it is right now it can't stand the way it is right now but I'm going to tell you there's a way out because listen there's there's a judgment coming there is death coming but there's a way out amen and we see all the way down through history God always making a way was always making a a call to the people to try to bring them through but there was only a predestinated group that actually listened to the message actually came through that but you know God always made a call and you know he all the time making all the way through as he as the scripture tells us he always sent the prophets to the people and he began to speak to them and show him he began to make himself known through the prophets and through the through the word began to speak to the people and began to UND let man know who he was and and show all these things but you know they were the ones that turned him down and only only a group a certain group caught those things that God had spoken to them but there were so many that walked right past that and did not because it did not tickle their fancy it was not it was not in the way they expected it to come it didn't it didn't meet their status quo but it was still God speaking to them and making himself known to them and and you have to you know God brings you to a place where you have to realize it's God speaking to you it's God's word to you because you come to a place you've got you got to face it full on fa and you got to come realize hey this is God speaking to me and and because as you know even when speaking of the the Rich Young Ruler when he realized who Jesus was and he stood there and he spoke to him good Master what do I have to do to inherit eternal life see he knew who Jesus Christ was when he stood there and began to speak to him and Jesus loved him and Jesus began to speak to him exactly what he had need of in his in that moment moment he knew what he had to do there was there was a requirement made before him and all he had to do is accept it but he turned it down and all the way down through history God was all the time wanting to make himself known and and deliver the people and show himself but you know they were the ones that turned him down but he continued and continued to show himself and you know he began to in the garden you know he made the promise that a deliverer would come there would be one that would crush the Serpent's head that would bring bring man back into fellowship and all the way through we see how all these things took place and but you know there was a a a battle that took place we always know there was a battle between Satan and and God all the way down through history Satan has always been fighting the plan of God all the way from the beginning but you know he came but in the in the course of time we know that Jesus Christ came in the fullness of the word that was spoken Spen of him all the way down through history we know that he's the word that was spoken of by the prophets the prophecies that were made he began to walk and he began to show the people exactly what was prophesied of him and what was going to take place because he pointed them back to the scripture and he said search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me so he began to point the people right back to the scripture to show them the day and hour which they were living that's right and he began to show them and he and he began to tell them listen of all the things that have taken place in the past when he began to speak of the the prophecies that were made in the Old Testament there were lots of prophecies that nobody understood but Jesus came and he began through his life and even in his ministry began to point them back to the scriptures and the Old Testament and began to bring them forth into the present day and showing them these are the scriptures that were spoken of and this is the day and hour which they live that's right and he when he began to speak the word and he began to identify the day in which they they were living then that it began to show them what was taking place there was only a group that that would only a certain group that would take that and there was many people that he began to speak to even when Nicodemus came to him came to him by night and he said you know we know you're a teacher sent from God because nobody can do these things unless God be with him he began to identify the scripture but you know what Nicodemus didn't take all the word that God that Jesus had presented to him right why because he he understood where he was standing but you know what he didn't he didn't follow it all the way through am because if he actually had sold out and actually believed he should have been on the day of Pentecost he should have continued all the way through but see God made a promise that what was going to take place that there was a judgment coming and there was a way to bypass that judgment there was a way made and he came into the scripture that to show them how they were going to be the Fulfillment of all the scripture that had been had been spoken of and he began to teach the the disciples and and the ones that were following him he began to teach them the word and he began to show them all these things that God wanted them to know what the scripture had spoken of them or what of the day in which they would live of what what would take place and not just some idea but you know and and because you know when you look at it there was so many that didn't didn't believe it because you know it didn't didn't come the way they wanted it to but you know what it come to the to the humble believer it come to the lowly the the ones that just took it by simple childlike Faith because it wasn't it wasn't who they were it was who God was it was who God spoke to them because when you look at at Peter and them being ignorant and unlearned and you know what they didn't have anything that would match anything that that would that would Merit any of God's grace but you know what God spoke to them why because he knew that they would receive it they would believe what God told them yeah and we know that you know in the in the time as he began to speak these things and he told him listen he said Terry when he when he when he told him that he was going to die and he rose again he told him he said listen Terry in Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high amen why because he told him he said listen he said I got to go away but the comforter will come unto you and said and he will teach you these things and what was going to take place in the future and all of a sudden you know the a lot of the confusion and the doubt and and all these things that they had to go through in their life and they didn't understand all these situations and why things took place but you know what when the Holy Ghost came there was a there was a boldness there was there was a knowledge that came to them that quickened the word to them and they they understood what was going to take place they knew what they were going to take place when when when Peter walked out there you know he he knew that listen Jesus gave his life for us here he is dying and because he's fulfilling the scripture you know what and and if he would if they would do that to him if he would lay down his life and that's what he would have to face then you know we may have to face the exact same thing but you know what they had boldness they they they counted to All Joy when they had to go and face the persecution and the and the death threats and the bodily harm they thought it was a great rejoicing because what God had done for them that was a small a small price to pay for what God had done for them and you know they listen I counted all joy when I fall into diverse Temptations when I fall into all these problems and everything like that I thank God for that why because God is making something out of me it's something that if just like we were reading here in job when when he began to speak of job and you know all these things when when he saw that job was a great man a godly man that he would stand these things that he could stand the the pressure and the testing that he went through and you know we understand that every child as brother R was talking about every child of the faith has to go through that same Journey still has to walk that same road has to go through the same trials and tribulations why it's going to bring you into the fullness of Christ into the measure of Christ he wants to bring you into the place where you're more like him and everybody's got to go through that testing and trials and and you know and he was talking about brother BR was talking about how how your uh in the Old Testament how they had tutors to bring them up and rais them up to be the right kind of son to bring them into the place and you know you know the father there in the Old Testament you know he want to find the right kind of tutor he that would that would mold that son into the image of the father what the father was would expect what the father would be proud of what he would honor that's the kind of tutor that he he just wouldn't get some anybody any fly by night or anything like that but he wanted somebody that could actually mow that stun into the right kind of person and you know and they and so it was you know they had to bring him up and you know there was a lots of times where you know it's a lot of difficulty and painful experiences and and struggles and heartaches but you know what it was bringing that son up to be into the place because if his father wanted somebody that could step into the place where he was at and and do the and do the father's business and be in the same place as his father and how it is with us brother Brown said that we had received the Holy Ghost the tutor the right kind of tutor in our lives to bring us to this place because we go through the same thing because he brings us on this journey it comes through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it it brings us the tutor in our life to bring us to the same thing to go through those same Journey the same walk that they had to go through bring us to the same place that we can be worthy amen of the life that Jesus lived that it's no longer us living but he said said it's him am it's no longer I but Christ Living in me amen and how we go through these these hard times and and difficulties and all these things but you know it's God bringing us through and it's you know because he knows what we need and what it's going to take to bring us to the right kind of place and you know all the all the the lessons that we have to go through we all don't have to face the same thing but it brings us to the same place it brings us closer to God and so you know we as we work through these things see it's the Holy Ghost brother said it's the Holy Ghost to raise the church and and to nurture it and honor and respect to the father in his word he said what a son grows got now God I'm say what a son God's got now he said but we've we've but we've adopted some men and their Theology and some of their man-made Creeds and you see where it's put it he said you holler about Sin and about communist are churches that are polluted he said pot can't call the kettle black it's exactly right he said I know that's oldfashioned preaching but it'll save you it'll make you different see they they go back and because they don't want to hold to what God brought you know he's bringing them to a place then you know brother R was talking about you know you preach on something and you try to show people the truth and he said you know they you preach on something he talk about the about the way they act and they're the way they're dressed and all these things and he said I come back the next year and it's worse the next year than it was before and it's just continuing on and on but you know there was a certain group of people that was going to catch that they were going to go and they were going to understand that was the word for their day they were they saw the light and you know it was for them it's not for everybody because you know you begin to speak to people and you begin to talk to people about the word and you know when when people bring things up and you begin to show people and you begin to just show just a little bit of things in the scripture and and you you know just pull a little bit out and you want to show people things and you know and you can just see how because people well they don't mind reading the Bible and they and they don't mind going to church but all of a sudden you start bringing things out because as soon as you bring things out that start showing where they're at and all of a sudden you because when you start to show them the truth of the word and it's like well you know I don't I don't try to condemn people but I'm but I don't mind telling you why I believe what I believe and I'm going to tell you why why I believe what you know and it's it's not to put anybody down but I'm going to show you this is this is what the Bible says and this is why we believe it amen because you know in the in the scripture you know I I was I was listening to these men talk the other day it was a little thing on on uh I think it was on Facebook but I'm sure but anyway you know they were showing this little clip and you they were talking about how way back went even even people today I mean they understand when you when when you look back people understand that the petarian Doctrine didn't come into like the the 4th century and there was and nobody nobody in the in the in the early church when in the time of the disciples in the time of the Apostles nobody believed in that Doctrine that's right abely and he was talking he was talking about he they were they were Pentecostals he said you know he said you know that everybody that wrote the uh anybody that wrote anything in the New Testament was a Pentecostal they come from Pentecost they had a p costal experience and so when they began to write the scripture they didn't have any of that stuff when you trace it back and and and the one man was a was a trinitarian and he was talking about how when you look at the word they didn't even have any of that till the fourth century and it's like well how in the world if if if that's what Paul wrote if that's what Peter wrote if that's what James and Jude and all them when he told him he said contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints then how in the world are you following something that's contrary to the scripture when you're standing there and knowing that this wasn't anything the Apostle Paul when he wrote about the the Lord and savior of our Lord and savior of Jesus Christ as the scripture says there I got that wrong but y'all know what I'm talking about yes sir but when he when he's speaking of that he's not trinitarian when so when he began to speak of these things why because he understood what the godhead was and how it fit together how there were offices not people not persons but when he began to speak this thing and there's a trinitarian scholar standing there saying yeah that's not right but you know what they get up every single day and Blessed Trinity here's here's we we believe this Blessed Trinity well you know what if it was wrong back there and there was no scripture for it then guess what today there there still no scripture for it and it's like you know and when you you know it's like listen when when when Jesus stood there and he said baptize them go into all the world preach the gospel baptize them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost when he said go baptize him in the name I said well tell me where the name's at that's right amen but there's one scripture in the Bible that gives us a name when it's a tied to baptism amen Glory there's only one scripture there's two scriptures in the Bible and one actually has a name tied to it when he go when Paul stands out there on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost comes and quickens the word to them and the drunk men stumble out the door and Peter stands up with the 11 and goes out there and begins to preach to them that these people aren't junk as you suppose but this is the Fulfillment of Joel am this is the Fulfillment of Joel's prophecy and he's putting them right there in the word and showing that this is what was going to take place I would pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and here they go and what do they do when he begins to speak to them and tell them of this scripture and it begins to bring Jesus Christ in there that this is the Fulfillment of the ministry of Jesus Christ and they're pricked in their heart and he said well don't you remember what Jesus said no he knew exactly what Jesus said because the Holy Ghost had quickened it to him and he said he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen right for remission of sins and he said and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so you know what if he started that on the day of Pentecost then guess what it's still in effect today because he hadn't changed or Peter was wrong right amen but that's interesting cuz Peter was the one that Jesus gave the keys to that's right he's the one to put this thing in order and send him out there here Peter take this and it's exactly what he began to do he began to take the scripture and fulfill that and began to preach that and it's still the same way today and it's like well how do you how do you know that's the same you know how I know it's the same you know how I know it works because I have taken the word I've taken God at his word and and fulfilled the word I went to the water and I got baptized and you know what I repented and I followed the prescription and you know what I can say that I got the I got the Fulfillment of it because because God honors his word if you take God at his word he's got to honor his right and if you're afraid to take God at his word then how is he going to honor his word but if you take him at his word just simple childlike Faith then he will honor his word said brother says now we are in the body of Christ First Corinthians 12 he said by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body he said by what he said that's the earnest of our inheritance he said we already got the down payment on it he said that we know that we've passed from Death unto life he said we look back and see where we once were and where we are now amen he said there's sin in the world down there and we've raised above it sitting with him our King in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus what an Evidence see God has brought us to the place to bring us beyond all these things to let us sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and you know and when when we look at our lives sometimes you know it's it's what the scripture says it's not what we think or what what we feel or how things look around us because you know there's lots of days when I wake up and I I look around and say I don't feel like I'm sitting in Heavenly places it's like I this this just don't look like Heavenly places to me right true brother but you know but that that's part of the plan of God to go through these things and and understand God's leading us and in the right way and he's leading us a certain way and wanting us to go through these things and you know God brings us the Victory and here we just keep following God on the way that he wants us to go and just continue to walk because the same one that started you on your journey is going to continue to lead you on your journey and lead you all the way because if he's LED you to the place where you've gotten baptized and you've gotten born Bor again you're born into the family of God and you're born into this Kingdom if you're in the kingdom of God and you and he said we he's made us to sit in Heavenly places and you know what then that's then that's our benefit that's what God has given us and you just continue to walk in that because it's the same one that started you on your journey it'll lead you all the way it's the same it's the same thing amen we just continue to walk and just keep walking in the same thing because the word will begin to open up to us and it begins to express itself because as the word as brother rown was talking about a a child being born when a when a child is born you know because the of them being a human and being born they begin to grow they begin to express these things they go through all the same things that children go through and all the things that they have to do learn to walk and all these things because it's part of the human experience and it's the same thing with a with a son or daughter of God when you're born into this Kingdom you begin to do the exact same thing because you begin to express the word that's birthed into you you begin to go through the same things and show why because it's not something that you can hide because you know when you're born and you begin to grow and you begin to be a human as a child you begin to grow up you know I didn't I didn't have I I tell everybody you know I didn't have to be like Dell Roberts why because his DNA is inside of me and it just began to express itself you know I began to people began to see hey we know who you are you're Dale's boy nobody nobody had nobody had to had to guess that but you know what because it was on the inside and it began to express itself and it's the same way because as they were there the the ones that there on in the day uh where was it Antioch he said he said they they called them Christians because they began to identify because their actions who what they done identified themselves to be Christlike and it began to express itself and they begin to see all the all these expressions of Christ and it's the same way with you and I if Christ is on the inside then you know what it can't help but Express itself why because just like a seed that goes into the ground if it's under the right conditions and it begins to bring forth and you know what that same seed when it becomes to bring bring forth then you know what it can't help but manifest what it is you go out there and plant plant crops in the ground and expect something else to come up right right you know you're out there planting corn and hoing the ground and getting everything prepped and you figure out what kind of fertilizer you need and put everything in the ground put all the seed in there it's like why didn't get any green beans well you know what if you it's what goes in the ground so if if the word of God's being swn and that's what brings forth then that's what it's going to manifest because if it's in you then Christ in you then that's what it's going to manifest your life is going to manifest Jesus Christ right even even in spite of ourselves and our and our our rotten ways sometimes we still Express God you know we still we still battle this old flesh well like brother Dale always said you know it would take more Rapture in faith for me than the rest of you but y it takes takes a lot more to overcome because there's more of me to overcome but you know what I expect that amen but you know I understand that that is what God is that's that's the promise that he made but that's also the battle that's also the conflict that's made that I'm going to have to overcome but you know what he's he said greater is he that's in us why because we battle this world the condition that the world is in all the things but you know what greater is he that's on the inside to overcome this world and all the things that that's in it and all the problems that we face all the troubles but we see all these things how they come all the problems that we face and all these things just like job when he was standing there and he was going through all this these hard times and but God knew who what God was you know what he was doing he was showing job job didn't understand what he was going through and you know how he struggled through all these things and brother Ram talks about you know job was on those on those sacred Sands you know back there going through all all that conflict as brother Bob was talking about you know out there scraping bows and all those type things and you know you couldn't you couldn't get a a breath of fresh air and you know because there's nobody around to give you any comfort you know all people that come by you know you like I wish y'all just go home y'all y'all ain't y'all are Physicians of no value y'all ain't helping me at all you know you don't find anybody you know even your even your wife tell you you know if if the best thing for you to do is just curse God and die it's like well you know you're you're not helping either but you know all those things you know but he was there on and brother Brown said every son and daughter of God has to go through that same situation those same be on the backside of the desert on those sacred Sands where it's just you and God Alone you have to go through all that you he was talking about all the different ones that had to go through their Moses and the different ones where they had to go through all of those battles by their s and it looked like well I don't understand why all these things have happened but you know that's what God wanted them to do to see and job understanding the condition that he was in and understanding why why he had to face these things but you know brother random said you know he he puts every believer on those sacred SS he said he has to take every real child there he gets you on those places where there where there's no devil can ever come there's no teacher can explain it away he gives you something on those Sands back there that an experience that you'll never forget as long as the ages roll on so there's a situation that you got to go through but it brings you to a place it brings you to an experience that you you get to a place that nobody can talk you out of it when you go through all these things and you wonder why things happen the way they do but you know God wants us just to follow him and listen just just just follow the leading of the Lord you know we don't have to understand but you know just follow what God wants us to do you know and and I I I can say that you know there's been many times in my life where I I fa many experiences in my life and I was like it takes many years down the road before I get an answer to it and I I've kept these answers I was telling brother Brother Richard and when I brother Richard's church I was talking about you know they I I heard I heard a man preach one time about Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan and you know I carried that for years I didn't understand that for years but you know there was something that struck me and I and I told him I said I told the Lord I said if this is truth you're going to have to show it to me because I don't understand it it just don't make sense I'm confused e everybody if this is right and I'm confused or they're wrong or something but you know it took years and it's like well Lord I don't understand it but you know I never never put that down I always kept that before the Lord you I want to know and it's like well you know what the Lord didn't come the next day he didn't come the next year but you know I I carried that for years didn't understand it I had people talk about it I've heard other people preach on it and it was and it didn't make any more sense it did the first than the first time but I was telling them I met a man one day and it was brother Dale and it took me years to carry that all those years and I was telling about but brother Dale was the first person to sat down and began to explain that to me exactly I didn't understand it but you know that was God put somebody in my path right because you know what that's what he said he said he's obligated and you know and and he he said put somebody behind the pull pit well let me tell you sometimes you pull pit is a kitchen table it's where where were the word's coming from we were sitting at we were sitting at their house at the kitchen table and he began to speak to me and it opened up the word to me amen something that I had carried all those years I didn't understand and just just a few moments is all cleared and I was like well praise God now I understand but you know the other thing is is I didn't feel like I was crazy because you know everybody else like woo look at this great Revelation like no but you know it's not it's not just going after something but it's holding something before the Lord and and wanting to know what God what the word is and said well Lord I don't understand this like well brother don't you understand no I don't and there's like I like I told him there's there's things in the scripture I don't understand there's things in the message I don't understand and you know what I don't I don't mind I tell you I don't understand it but you know the problem is is is people they they think they they know they think they understand something but the problem is they don't just like just like brother Dale always said he said you get people they they won't talk about the seals they know all about the seals they can answer all the seals and they don't know one thing about Daniel 7 weeks well you know what like brother Dale said he said I didn't say it the prophet said it and he said you ought take it up with him can't take it up with me cuz I'm GNA tell you the prophet said you don't understand this you're not going to understand the seals amen you're not going to understand all these other things and he say why is it so important because you got to understand the word amen right and so you know when you see it's so important because if you've got to have the right heart you you've got you've got to come to the right place Lord I need this I need help but if you come to the I I know it no you don't know it brother and that's and that's the problem people people can't humble themselves to the place and realize listen I need I need help am right and just just admit it I don't know and you know what if if that's that's that's the first thing you got to come to is realize I need help I don't understand that's right you know I was looking at some things where brother R talk about you know he didn't there was a lot of things he didn't understand in his life you know he would sit there Lord I don't understand this I don't understand I don't understand that you know I was I was reading something the other day I thought was it was really good you know when when that when that black sister in in Memphis when when she was out praying for for God you know she's like I'm just like that sh sh woman God gave me a son and he's over here dying and he said you know I'm just like like her said but where's Elijah she began to pray for Eli where where's your Elijah because if if I'm this person then the other one in the in the scripture is Elijah he's got to be here somewhere that's who I need and you know what and she had Faith to believe that she didn't know where he was going to come from or what was going to take place but you know what she had Faith to believe and you know what she G she began to pray as a brother R talks about you know she began to pray all night because she got to desperation she began to pray all night for her answer amen and all of a sudden God didn't speak to brother brandom he spoke to her amen some illiterate wash woman some some auntie in Memphis living in a shack God spoke to her and showed he her what he looked like she knew exactly what was going to take place and and the Lord told her you go stand out by the gate now here he is he's up there at the PE body Hotel getting ready to mail some letters out and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit talks speaks to him and said walk and one time I was reading in the in the thing brother BR said he walked for an hour and a half just walking he just kept walking and walk where am I going I don't know I just keep getting further and further further away from where I'm supposed to be what he's thinking and all of a sudden he walks down through there and it's lady with a with a man's shirt tied around her head wet from Dew and and all good morning Parson good morning Auntie and he walking on he's like Parson how'd you know oh the Lord showed me he coming the Lord showed me that you were coming amen it's like where's your where's your briefcase where's your Satchel I seen you I was like well I left it back at the hotel see she knew everything and and so she went so he went in and and because she was telling him that her son was dying and and began to speak to the scripture now you know what it was fulfillment of the word to her she she was walking in a different realm but you know brother brandom stand there saying I don't know I don't understand many times when brother Brandon begins to when he get when he kneels down to pray for that boy brother brand says Lord I don't understand Lord I don't know he said Lord I walked all this way and he said this is the only thing that I have fa in all in all of this is this lady has stopped me so he went into her house and she begins to pray he said Auntie pray over her so he prayed and said listen she know how to pray she talked to God before right but he said when I laid my hands on that boy and started praying said Lord I don't understand why this is going on all I'm doing is following the leading of the Holy Spirit I'm just following the leading and you said you said walk and I'm here and I don't he said I don't even know if I'm in in the right place but there's somebody that's sick and this is what I pray for the sick amen but he said Lord I pray that you touch this young man and all of a sudden he's like oh Mama it's getting light in here oh Mama it's getting light in here and then all of a sudden you know he gets up and he's sitting on the side of the bed and brother brandom runs out the door and heading toward the plane and the plane's on the ground the whole time till he gets there and catches his plane on the way home that's right right well here's the prophet of God why didn't God why didn't God speak to brother brandham and tell him said listen there's a lady you going to have to walk 14 and half miles down here down on the left house is yellow you know whatever you know she's got a red bandana tied around her head you know what why didn't he tell why didn't he tell her the house number so her house number is such and such but he didn't give her any of that God didn't tell him any of that he walked by faith just following the leading just about just like just like when brother Ram was encamped in Arkansas that time and that blind black man was there he's out there yelling Mercy Mercy crowd of people everybody everywhere trying to get a hold of brother brandom trying to touch brother brandham trying to get brother Bram to pray for him there's sick folks everywhere all over the place and he's standing there and the Holy Spirit speaks to him and he sees that because of Jim Crow he was further away but brother brandham told the police officers he said I'm going over there and oh brother BR we can't do that this is Jim Crow he said the Holy Spirit told me go over and see that man and he said he he said he said I thought of blind bmus when he saw that man over there and he said I began to walk over to that man and he said he said I walked over that man he said he said Uncle what can I do for you and he stood there and he told him he said Parson brandham he said my M's passed on but he said she had your kind of Legion but you know what she stood at the foot of my bed now he was blind he said but I it was like she stood at the foot of my bed and told me said honey get up get dressed and go to Camden Arkansas there's a man by the name of brandom who prays for the sick and you'll receive your sight and that and that man got up and him and his wife was all the way in Camden Arkansas he said he said Parson BR him he said I've never met you before he said I don't know anything about you but he said my M never lied to me while she was on the earth and she was the one that come to me and she said I'm here he said I'm here because that's what she told me to do he come all of 200 miles to Camden Arkansas and here brother Brown the Holy Spirit leads him over there to that man and he begins to speak to him and he begins he hears this testimony you know what brother brandom said he he began to lay his hands on the man and began to pray and the first thing he says is Lord I don't understand this he said Lord but I'm just following the leading of the Holy Spirit I don't understand why I'm here or what's going on but you brought him all this way and why why is all these thousands of people are sick why is it coming to this one man but he lays his hands upon this man and he begins to pray for him and all of a sudden he receives his sight and he says later on he said I got a letter from that from that same man and he be after he got his sight he began to preach the gospel began to travel and preach the gospel why because it was the leading because God didn't always give brother brandham the answers didn't always lead him the but all he done was follow the leading of the Holy Spirit oh if if if we could if we could have a brother brandham experience you know if we could just have a prophet you know experience like the prophet had well you know what there was lots of times that brother brandham didn't know what to do brother how many how many times that talk about having hundreds of plane tickets on the table and all kinds of invitations to go everywhere and preach and everybody's sick and they want you to come and he said all I can do is pray and he said but but he said because if if it wasn't for the Holy Spirit if it wasn't for God leading me he said you'd become neurotic Y and we say oh I wish I wish I had a you know I wish I had an experience like like brother brandham had boy I well you know what you can when the Holy Spirit begins to to lead you and he begins to guide you down a road and you say well Lord I don't understand well guess what you're having the same experience brother brandom had amen all the way through the scripture there's many of them that didn't didn't understand right you know I mean how many people would like to be like ananas was out there the Holy Spirit spoke to ananas ananas we got this great man named Saul he strikes fear in people's hearts nobody wants to be in the same town where he's at but all of a sudden he said ananas I've got a man a servant he's going to do great work for me I want you to go over there and pray for him that he can receive his sight we got ananas jumped up said praise the Lord I do it no he didn't he's like you want me to do what Lord do you know what kind of person this man is no he's had a conversion amen it's like well you know might might might have took a little praying like Lord is that really what you want me to do but you know it it took the moving of the spirit but all of a sudden Here Comes Here Comes ananas to pray for him here he sees Saul laying there blind all hunched down and he said brother Saul he said the Lord sent me to pray for you that you can receive your sight amen because God has a work for you to do you know and all of a sudden here he here he goes and he begins to speak and he begin to pray over and all of a sudden Saul raises up and you know he goes by the name of Paul and and it continues on well you know the first thing that he does is he don't run out and tell everybody what took place but he took the scripture and he spent three and a half years studying the scripture he got right into the word because it was something that took place that something was Quicken to him that day and he began to open up the the scripture began to open up and then he began to preach the gospel what the Lord had showed him all of those years that he had studied all of the Old Testament all those Scrolls knowing every word that the prophets had to say and all of a sudden in a in a short period of time it began to open up and he could see Jesus Christ in every part of it see if you can't see if you can't see Christ and never he said go back and read it again and here he he began to preach all those things all even even when he began to talk about the Tabernacle and all the different minute things and all kind of different things he be began to see Jesus Christ what a wonder what a wonderful thing it was that all those things that he had went through now back when he when he went through all those things and and he suffered all these things lots of times there's there's no he didn't God didn't give him an answer you know how many times how many times did Paul Get Shipwrecked beat stoned yes that's right you look at all the things he went through the scripture says I spent a night and a day in the Deep that's a long time to be out treading water but you know he counted all joyen all of it every bit that he went through just just just doing just doing my part he said I'm the I'm the least in the Kingdom I'm the least of all the saints and look look what he went through amen bold all the things that he had he had to face and fight then he stood up and said and and and there is his testimony you know he said he said I I prayed to God I had a I had a thorn in my flesh that Satan used to Buffet me that's right and he said I prayed to God I kept praying to God that he'd deliver me of this thing and you know what God didn't deliver him of it but he brought him his word and said my grace is sufficient he said then I glory in my weakness goes in strength it's made perfect see here as he was talking about strength is made perfect in weakness however he went to go through all these things and realize you know I still batt all these things but you know what God's made me a Victor he's made me strong to overcome these things and I I will glory in my infirmities amen all the things that he had to face all the way he went through see all those things that we go through we wonder why we're in the world the condition that we're in today but you know he all wants all of us to have our time brother BR said all of us have to have our time on the ash Heap to go through all those times sitting on the ash Heap and why because God bring it brings us closer to him you know we don't always understand why we have to go through these things but we know God brings us to these places but you know he always brings us through and he says brother R says I I we don't know what will what will come he said what will take place but we know one thing that we're on the ash Heap the nations's on the as sheep the world's on the as sheep and because the world is on an as sheep I'm so glad that the spirit of God can come and we can say My Redeemer liveth and at the last day he'll stand on the earth someday he will come see we go to see all these things while the world is in the condition that it sinned but you know what he's still in control amen and he's brought us and put us on this ashy but you know what he will bring us through just like he did job we don't know what what's going to take place in the future but God's the one that's in control he's all the time that he will bring us through these things that we because God wants us to have these a certain type of experience that we know God can bring us through because if we don't go through these things we don't know what we can stand you go through these things and you wonder why you go through these heartaches and troubles and tri and problems but you don't know what God will bring you through and when you go back and you look back of all these things that you've been through then you realize you know it's not me God's brought me through all these things you know I was I was telling sister Esther we were talking about Abraham Lincoln and and I was showing her one of my favorite quotes of brother Brown uh brother brother Abraham Lincoln uh amen and we were eating we were eating Sunday and and you know I was talking about you know um that's that's one of my one of my heroes Abraham Lincoln I was born on his birthday uh and so uh I always admire him and uh brother Brown had a lot of good things to say about him so our greatest president and a real godly man but you know at the end of at the end of toward the end of his uh Administration you know he made he made a comment I I always loved it he saidou know he said when it comes my time to lay down the Reigns of power' and he said you know I I want to conduct my Administration that he said he said' if I have lost every other friend in the world he said I will have one friend and he's down inside me right amen and you look you look at all the things that that he went through in his life he had a lot of of contentions and you know a lot of people didn't agree with a lot of things that he done and how he handled things but you know what people look back and they say well what a man of wisdom yes amen what a what a man of of great learning and and you you read his writings and it's like man how how amazing this man was amen but you go back and look at his beginning a humble beginning being born in a l cabin amen reading Pilgrim's Progress Fox's book of Martyrs the Bible that was his beginning of his education right reading reading that the scripture was was the foundation of his life and the other thing was that he had somebody he had a stepmother that stood there and knew that God had a call on his life and she wanted him to learn as much as you can to learn all that learn all that you can and you know she she wanted him to read and study and be you know because of his because of his great love for learning you know he become a lawyer and all those things but you know it was something that she saw there was a gift in his life that God was going to use him and there was somebody there that stirred up that gift and encouraged him to go that way when there was nobody else that really was trying to help him and you know they just well you're just you're just a tall lanky fell from Kentucky we don't expect you to maybe become much or or do much but there was somebody that crossed his path and told him said listen right go has a work for you to do and it's like well I just want to go this way I don't know what I don't know what the future holds or what's going to take place but I know God is leading me amen and that's the way you and I are we just take what I want to go God's way every day whichever way it goes there's there's a way for me and I want to follow it amen as job said he knows the way that I take and when he has tried me I'll come for as gold because he said I have not strayed from his from his way amen the way that God shows me that's the way I continue to walk and that's that's our goal I'll walk the way God has shows you to walk even if you don't see it you go through Dark Times cloudy days because if you see the the dark clouds and all that doesn't mean God's not with you that doesn't mean that God doesn't love you right and just because it's sunny and bright and everything looks great that doesn't means God's approval but you know we're if you're a child of God you know what if he loves you in the beginning he ain't changed his mind because he can't change his mind amen God bless you let's all stand we'll have the musicians come amen amen so thankful
