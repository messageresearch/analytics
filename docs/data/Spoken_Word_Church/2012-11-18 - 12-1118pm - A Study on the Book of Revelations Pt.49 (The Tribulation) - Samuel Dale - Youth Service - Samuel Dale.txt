Revelations 1 and revelation 6. these books were placed back there on the thing in this to be my sister Rebecca Smith it was menopause that time of life to all the men this get accomplished amen that's right okay I think we all need a copy amen the women they know all about it they're the ones going through it right but you know you know if you want a copy of them this afternoon that you're gonna get you one is by Rebecca sister Rebecca Smith and somebody had brought him into us so we'll we'll pass them out maybe most of you already have them and everything but a good thing right I wrote around and said at any end time that ever you got a sweetheart is when she's going through the change of life just stay with her then that's right you know so that's a good point but I always say too women when us men are going through the change of life that's right you think men don't go through it sure oh yes and you've got a treat if you ain't been through it yeah all right you know when you get old enough you'll find out what I mean to change your life learning a lot isn't it amen but just remember these things okay uh the announcements remember the uh the wedding on the first of December uh did it Lincolnton and also remember the uh the Gathering Together on the ninth day for ninth day of December for our Christmas time together and we have a wonderful time in doing that and we are doing it we do it to thank all of the people for their uh doings for the year and their times of working and all like that and that together in the Lord amen okay any other announcements I generally forget something about locking the door downstairs you've got the doors locked okay I have to go do it we've had a little problem with somebody walking around so we've had to um lock the doors downstairs not the one coming up the stairway now that's not that's the end of the church we're talking about down into the bottom part of the of the church because of somebody walking around and doing things and there's a lot of equipment downstairs that could be very easily carried out while we're up here right on the side door so we'll just have to lock it up down there if you need to go downstairs don't get all excited just find Terrence or somebody and they got a key they can open the door for you okay just don't go haywire and try to run off to McDonald's you know just hang around we'll try to take care of everything but we just do it because of that and then but the main stairways are open they're not that's not locked up it's just the downstairs part okay all right yeah do you have any father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and the time that we can have upon the Earth when we can actually really be able to read your word and to comprehend what is being said unto us because our eyes have been opened to the truth and Lord we can see then what is written in thy word things that we pondered and wondered about things that man has gone crazy to try to figure out and all of that has been made known to us in the end time by way of the Prophet who brought the word into us and now we thank you for all of the things we ask you now to just bless each one of us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us in your love I ask it all in Jesus name amen Revelations one what is this book about the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he soon and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth today that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein where the time that is at hand okay Revelation 6 verse 12. and that beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal now who opened the seal the lamb right right and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black a sackcloth of her and the moon became his blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree passes her untimely fix Ed when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed is a scroll when when it is as they scroll when it is rolled together in every mountain and Island were moved out of their places the kings of the earth and the great man and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond one and ever Freeman hidden themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne from the Wrath of the Lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who should be able to stand you may be seen the Lord have his Blessing to the reading of the word now we are trying to just study some things and just look through that the message and see and not just basically preaching on the seals and things but to this going through the Book of Revelation as I said this morning he's in the Book of Revelations truly is the bride's book amen right because now we can understand there was a time we couldn't we were told to stay out of it have a Genesis day out of Revelation why because it would show who we are and what's going on like I said this morning I've made this statement for many many years I believe it The Book of Revelations is the bride's book amen because you never see Jesus standing in the Book of Revelations by himself he's always with the bride or in the bride or with Israel you know in dealing in Israel and the things you know to thereby but he's never seen by himself and you find that he is oh coming forth like we brought it down this morning to you know Luke 17 30 that the son of man would be revealed and then we see that we get over in the Book of Revelation about 1 13 of our bouts and it talks about one life under the son of man you see it was so close to the likeness until that's why it emphasizes one life under the son of man and the prophet said that's bride right he looked to see the voice and saw the bride well we can find ourselves then we went through and picked up through the Church of Aviation a few things and we went up into the the uh started in the seals and begin to just read them and then going on through and we've gotten up now we spent quite a lengthy time on the fifth seal because there was a lot of things that there that needed to be a little emphasis placed upon and then now we're coming over into the Sixth Seal and what did we see as we started out this morning that in the fifth sixth and seventh still there is no combat Beast there's only four and that ends on the fourth seal and the Rapture takes place on the uh the in the seventh Church age but in the the revealing of the seals before Co would cover up to Armageddon and being up to Armageddon in the Rapture of the church had already taken place because Armageddon is at the end of the three and a half year tribulation period to setting up the cleansing of the earth and the things getting ready for the millennial Reigns all right in doing that then we drop back the prophet said it to the fifth seal and see who these souls are that were under the Altar and found out that they were the the chosen of Israel that the prophet said was from the time of Calvary down to the Rapture of the church it would be that group of people that was killed down through there and they will be given what roads all right and I told you I said that's the most marvelous understanding of justification our true mercies of God Amen because a group of people that do not want Jesus Christ as their savior they rejected him as being their savior but yet when it comes down to the end of it God kept his word amen because he had spoken and said that people would be saved Paul covered it all Israel will be saved he said now not ever Israel only those the prophet said whose names were written on the lounge for Goliath amen amen and said they remained our remember their son that on and off and different things but and then when we get through that part we see the wonderful story of Grace as a sin that he would give her mercy of Salvation that he would give those people white robes who did not even want it whatsoever and he said that wasn't this Wall Street much of Jews he said it was a real one from down in those countries that had never heard the gospel you know that plow and he said even still with a wooden plow we were there in Israel years ago and actually saw him doing that was still just in one handle plow you're doing things and and those people are good people but yet they rejected the Messiah they were blinded let us be coming in all right then we came on over into the Sixth Seal and seeing that there's no combat Beast all right now we found out this morning that the fourth combat Beast would be the eagle and by being that being John would pick up in the 10th chapter and say but in the voice days of the voice of the seventh angel he could see that there would be a possibility of bringing this great Revelation to the church by way of the seventh Church AIDS messenger our seventh angel all right then that would put us into that position that we could see it right and then you don't have to put right around over here me that's been massively confused by people in the message of saying they don't understand but the prophet said it so we believe it and it sounds it I just want it revealed right all right then uncovering that we saw in this six sealed there's no combat Beast but I told you there was a great secret partner too when we got into the fifth seal and it was a very simple thing in the fifth seal there's no symbols right you just read it right it tells you those people right that's right it tells you what happened it tells you how they got there right it wasn't a symbol of a white horse or a red horse or a symbol of this or a symbol of that why because that would make it to where the Prophet could just expound upon it and we could see it amen then it would open up to our eyes and see the same thing when we come into the Sixth Seal there's no symbols they just said it to him this great earthquake and it tells you the things that transpire during this earthquake one because see we have come through the understanding and now the symbols are broken right the moisture symbols are broken what's the problem of understanding now we can go through the Bible and understand we can see all them symbols that was back there and Ezekiel would say A Wheel in the middle of the wheel all right or he would say uh that they were running like lightning of Blue Book what's that um you know cherish Johnson in the streets right the symbols have been broken by way of the Prophet Messenger to explain the Bible okay we don't have no excuse for not understanding you know well but brother Dale oh you know I don't understand why don't you read I mean you claim brother was a prophet yes yes and yet you know more about uh the presidential race come on man that's right man you sure like to argue what brother dick said one day he said he'd go out there gills from where I live because he see him sitting out there so they ain't going out there not all in the world they do it in argue politics and what good is it out of all her arguments who got elected yeah right whether you like it or not no I'm not a Republican or a Democrat I guess I'm a polar crowd or something because I just I voted a lifetime for John F Kennedy I found out right around and said you put a Catholic in the white house I'm honest and ain't voted no more because and I'm not saying if you not to vote that's your privilege but you know I'm just saying that we're in the end time and surely surely you can see yes my brother called made that statement the other day it was pretty good he said if you're voted for Obama that he's a muslim with a prophet false prophet but if you'd have voted for Romney they got a false prophet so we voted for Jesus Christ amen and God's got a prophet I like that statement it was a good point put all the money set into that you know looking at those things I enjoy look at the things but what does it make a difference right I love the scriptures amen he said I put in Kings I take out Kings you know who God wanted in the White House the God is not her because he put them in he's going to take them out that's right he's the one we need sure we may be hungry but we're going to be taken up because they're not going to shed us up right all right amen amen I believe they could be some horrible days laying ahead of us but I believe in a God that brought around said it he said the bride does better under persecution we ain't got nobody bothering us and the words we got is you sisters getting like that when you walk to Walmart yeah we say there's no problems we need something to jog us a little to make us dig down and see who we really are all right but that's what I'm trying to do all right but there's no symbols in the six seal you just said an earthquake yep I won't get into that part because it takes a message in itself we talk about the earthquakes and then you know people say with this and this this well we're going to read in a minute there's an earthquake when the seal opens there's an earthquake after it's open right yep there's an earthquake at the resurrection when Jesus raised and I believe that'll be one in the end time when the bride races yeah look a lot of earthquakes tonight but yet we narrow down to one or two things and we make our own talks or a Doctrine idea but no symbols right now whether you believe it or not in the Baptist Church actually basically you read more of The Sixth Seal in the commentaries and schofields Etc about the Sixth Seal when you do of any other form because we used to say this was a tribulation of course we'll get to it in a minute we used to believe we all went through the tribulation too you know that was a great mystery right the great straightening up amen because see we talked about it we I've heard preachers preach about the the six seal they didn't call it because they didn't know to bring it they were bringing earthquakes and things that's right but you see the prophet didn't come to tell us what it was now get what I'm saying you'll see the offense oh the power of the reveal word all right the uh the importance of it right it's just like I said this morning the lamb could break the seal please the eagle couldn't tell you what that seal was it was closed up to him right and he says on that first seal written it he said I'd made a horrible mistake now listen Church we were dealing with this the other day in a meeting the brother was bringing out that when brother when the sword came and brought around his hand remember in Sabina Canyon right the sword came in his hand right then he comes all the way back right and it was even the the angel saw you know the clouds and and the voice there says go back to Jeffersonville then we told you what to do it a lot of people thinks all that was opened out the urban according to him that was right now according to him he said on that first Hill he said you know right before he said I don't know what it is right well he said I'd have made a horrible mistake if God had to come and straightened me I don't want to see him to say reach it first see them it's after the sword in his hand after the things he still didn't have the understanding until the angel of the Lord met him and revealed the word because he was a prophet yes but those things were sealed up I was laying that down this morning to say this that it wasn't under the line it wasn't under the Opps it wasn't under the man but you could call that man death it was under the Eagle right all right then there's the eagle now all he has to do on the fifth sixth and seventh seal you notice I said Zelda could I believe he done it all he's got to do is tell us what that is right he doesn't have to deal with symbols anymore that's a wonderful thing he didn't have to deal with symbols he just told us what it was who are these wrote a random he asked the question on the fifth seal he said this is Israel to be saved as a nation what is this six seal that we're talking on he finished the tribulation period those are not symbols those are statements of fact God vindicating a prophet just tell us the symbols how much more when he's just speaking it straight I'm telling you what it is amen this is the Tribulation period no questions he just answered it not a symbol right it's a great statement then in the Sixth Seal open it opened went up earthquake and when it did then you're told what will happen right that's right the little turn of this just don't do that you say well well brother Dale I I don't know where this happened that happened see now you're trying to figure it out that's right we talked about one down there though Moon turned into blood I've heard every kind of a definition said I can tell you where that's already happened well until you find where he said it happened you're just beating your head against the wall good as your own concept do we could talk about it and I believe in it when the towers fall they're in the scripture jerk I was in the word those two planes didn't go into those Powers by accident man I was in God's work I can't believe that then you can find back there that they stood before the Watergate and read the word why don't you remember when that happened yes the Watergate trials and situations right right when the prophet was striking the Earth with the word I believe in all of those things but what I love to Anchor It Down is when the prophet sits this is what it is right go before then you can argue opinions or ideas but when you say the prophet said right that settles it all right so then let's just go on into it let's pick up where we left off this morning and you forgive me for my throat like I said I either put in cough drop or a hush so a lot of people says well don't put in the cough truck ideas for eight or ten years nice Stripes I'm Healed and that's right I ain't worried about it but I had a bad throat I'm so you pray for me about that and forgive me for having to handle it all right don't know what happens go ahead let's start with number 10 on our quotes remember what is this six seal we want you to tell us all right so when he gets in the sick city of paragraph 67. you talk about the time you know we're studying right now this time that we're studying right now is what right after the church is done gone no Revelation 4 1. yep there's a bride going up 19 just him coming back see all right see these things are the tribulation period I love that you know to have it understand it but this is the part I love the rest of it I mean I think it'll be truly settled and every believer's heart that this true church never takes the tribulation period amen you cannot put nowhere the church in the tribulation what you put the church there but nothing right right see see the bride's done gone because she has not one sin another thing against her the grace of God has covered her over under bleached has took every sin away she's right into the presence of God she doesn't have to worry about the tribulation all right but the tribulation period and then we'll drop over and uh pick up a little bit more about because I thank God and we don't have to go through the tribulations the basics of world teaching religion you know is that you're going through the tribulation at least there is a division among it all of them don't teach everything the same there's a division among it that says they're going to be three and a half years minor tribulation in three and a half years major tribulation and the teaching is that the bride Church they call it right right if you're through the three and a half years of minor tribulation but then she goes up and then there's a major tribulation and a great vast number of Gentiles would be saved in the major tribulation well they run around when he came out and told us right a lot of things were settled right there and he said sit down a lot of people don't agree with him he's the next people sitting right here no yeah that don't agree because they believe the bride's going to go through this tribulation and he said no sir you can't do it then some confused even brother Branham when he preaches on the Daniel 70 weeks it takes one week after the Rapture they confuse that with the denominational teaching of the tribulation of minor tribulation major but he had no connection whatsoever to it all right and there is no Gentiles to be saved after the Rapture okay it's not in the scripture any word he said that's right they got to be saved now well who is that group in the tribulation it's only Israel in 144 000. all right we'll get back to that and do it but I just want you to see the main thing is what is this seal it's the tribulation pyramid right the things that man as I said has talked about horrible times would come up on the Earth and it would be a vast problem um to where the birds would even eat off the Flesh of you while you're alive see uh of this if we read where they would cry for the rocks to fall on them and hide them that's not a symbol that's a fact of what will take place one day that's right upon the Earth right all right then in seeing that and seeing that we don't have to go through that amen if that don't clear your heart man I'm going to say it anyway because I if you're not very if you're pretty old we had that denominational Doctrine where do you understood it or heard it talk Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal whatever believe that the church is going through the tribulation so I never heard that talk in my church maybe you wasn't deep enough in the ranks to understand some of they were saying maybe you slept in like you do now maybe you don't agree maybe you just shut your mind off because I realized minds are like computers you know they'll blow a fuse and the thing won't work no more right and my sit down has its own mind and I don't know how to figure it out and I don't have the little boy in uh Blended Day wood they're coming over to straighten out on Dagwood's computer every time I got a big old boy named Richard my son-in-law and they just call him up and say hey this thing's messing up again you have to come over and fix it and uh he's gracious to do that but now listen if it's the tribulation period who would want to go into that right and what we just reading you remember brother random when he was preaching about his first sermon and he preached about hell am he said to one thing one problem we wouldn't know God there there what no Daddy there man the yellow understanding what would be the most horrible thing you could think of burned alive um animals eating off your flesh while you're alive that would be the problem if you had thoughts of God stepping on the scene in just a second to take you to Glory right man it would not be an enjoyable time but you would know you had something left the greatest of all but what about if you don't have no homes that's right you realize churches you and I miss this rapture we we got a problem trying to qualify for foolish virgins even though I believe that there will be more foolish virgins out of this message than anywhere right and I can quote where the brother around said it's those out of the seal book who never heard the message or those who were blinded by false Shepherds right you know the preachers of this message are blinding the people to the truth amen and they're going to wind up in the tribulation period maybe God will be gracious to him and give them eternal life at the white throne but I don't try to reserve anything just in case this don't work out that's right you know that's what the people now are doing and churches are doing they put their money in the Swiss bank account just in case they want a little bit left over or something you know just in case well I've never done that I always just give away everything I had never worry about it and uh I just I don't have no second thing this is it all right I got a problem but I'm not worried about it I just didn't want to be it I want to encourage you and to teach you to be able to miss the tribulation amen right well the only way you can miss a tribulation is be born again right if you're not born again you're going into the tribulation I am too if I'm not born again right right you know that's the prophet said the most important thing in your life is whether you're born again or not right it's not who's going to be president amen it's not whether you got a meal to eat it's whether you're born again but I've never been one too that like to you know say well okay we'll go this way but if it don't work out then we'll cry out for it later I've always told you what I believe I'd rather go through life seeking God asking him am I Born Again and wind up at the end of it and him tell me I already had it and to go through life and not seeking it because of my great religious thing that I am you know I believe the message I believe all the prophets said I believe everything and find out one day he'll say depart from me I never knew you because you know right then where you're going that's right this thing is not to be played with right the message is perfect amen amen you see we need to be the people as I was covering this morning of the prophetic people to believe the prophetic message that's right now put a stand and say the prophet said amen I don't like these things you know what is your input on this I don't like that word cause that simple looking about and you don't either so let's talk about her inputs what do you think and I'll compare it with what I think I'll tell you what I believe not where I stand right like that that I'm sorry I don't want to be the truth to stand one day and be able to present a group of people to Jesus Christ right you say I taught you the word yeah yeah see not just left it to where you flip-flums in backwards and forth you know trying to find everything you can you notice the people of this message you've got a young man rise up he's got a little leadership you know a little bit of an anointing about him a little bit of persuasive preaching in fact and the people the message just run to it and they run the boy they listen this is it this is it after a while you see him kind of fading away may go find him another one that away two that's a great thing for us to realize and I wish I was the type of preacher that could preach you remember the man Brothers somebody told it that the man was preaching about being on a ship and it was sinking you know you know he preached it so captivating until the guy jumped up and hollered man alive folks you know they just got so involved I wish I could do that I wish I could preach hell and it so horrible until no one would want to go there hmm I wish I could preach his six seal and so horrible events that would take place it would scare the children to even think of it but never found anybody that got converted off of that type of preaching right now you tell me you did right that ain't gonna hold you that's right some of the revealed words you shall know the truth right not a truth right I'll set you free that's right amen what about we see most of us now are beginning to fall there are sometimes as much as a baseball or even on a rare occasion as much as a softball this beats everything to pieces but what about in the tribulation and a block of ice will weigh 90 pounds that's right you see when I get on the bridge I didn't plan on falling out of the sky the biggest problem is you ain't gonna be under the bridge the bridge is going to be on top of you you know but yet that's going to take place he said I don't see how in the world I can happen is because we fool with nature so much until we messed it all up and it can happen The Way of All of Us forms it it starts down this you know beginning to form and that raises back up and comes back down again and each time it does it's increasing its size so you fool around with those things out there like like science has and you got it all messed up we're creating our own death you remember the prophet God don't kill nobody God didn't cause the flood man caused the flood yeah right because my Bible says God yeah that's true what reads your profit man your Prophet explains that God didn't do it man did that that's right nuclear destructions and things told the Earth catered to where this wobbly right what about a horrible life you think of the most sickening thing you could think of in your life put an animal to be able to eat off your body before you die that's the tribulation but we don't have to go there because we go up in a wretch I'm not doing it then it's left to someone else we'll go to the number 11 now bro I got 190 of the six sealed and he says this six healed is a tribulation period that's what takes place the bride is gone see there's no living creature nothing can nothing there to say it it's just now God is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's been with Israel see you see this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the Kingdom by the two prophets of Revelation 11. remember Israel is a nation God's servant Nation when and when when Israel is brought in it'll be a national Affair Israel the kingdom age is where David the son of David says on the throne now that goes on into the Millennium right all right we said it's brought in by these two Prophets now let's read that scripture of Revelations 11. go ahead and put it up right Revelation 11 which is number 12 on your notes I got it over this time the Jimmy head of me I appreciate these brothers you'd be surprised what we do sometimes because we Shuffle books back there because I changed it right in the middle of the course and go running in there they put 11a and 11b you know I'm done changing everything because all right but watch what he says and brother around said these are the two Prophets in Revelations 11. all right now watch it and that was given unto me I really like them under like them to A rod an angel still saying rise and measure the temple of God and the Altar and build that worship Larry but the court which is without the temple leaves out and measure it not but he's given under the Gentiles and the holy city shall be destroyed Under Foot 40 in two months all right yep yeah and I will get power unto my two witnesses bless your prophesy a thousand two hundred three score days which is 42 months because you're back to 30 days to a month right all right these are the two olive trees goes all the way back over Zechariah and they're two candlesticks standing before the god of the Earth and if any man hurt them fire proceeded out of their mouth and devour their enemies and if any man shall hurt them he must in this manner be killed please have power to shut Heaven Let It Rain not in the days of their prophecy do you think about it if it was nothing but just being three and a half years without water now where would it be anything to be able to survive right you better hope they can create water one of these days right these have power that shits Heaven that it rained on the days of their prophecy we know that's like Moses and Elijah our old Waters to turn into blood this might be Earth with plagues as often as they will think about it we'll read or think about it the minute we get down to it you know that when these two prophets are killed they actually send notes around the world and celebrate right because their enemy is dead and you think about it your baby is starving to death and it's nine of thirsts and you got a pool of water and Moses and Elijah walks by and it says blood let's turn to blood ain't no good to hardly drink blood is it see they get to the bases that they're hated yep for three and a half years they played him with the voice of God for three and a half years as a human being you'd want them taken out of the way right but you know what's so horrible to think about how caramel it could be you know it was stated that when brother Brown passed on the sun said our enemy is gone for sure you think you wouldn't be that way you get hungry you'll do anything you'll eat each other it would be better go on a diet because maybe they want to eat the bigger ones first then that gets you the last quit open but listen they can Smite the Earth anytime they want to yep and then when they finish their testimony three and a half years they preach 42 months we just read it what happened the beasts that ascended out of the bottomless pit you'll make war against them and she'll overcome them and kill them is it over with no you know within and their dead body shall on the street of the great city which is spiritually call Sodom and Angel where our Lord was crucified in other words of Jerusalem they're the people in Kindred and cons and Nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a high and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in Graves right they that dwell upon the Earth shall rejoice over them how horrible can anyone be and make Mary and she'll send gifts one to the other because those two Prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth and they're gone see all right and after three days and a half Spirit of Life coming from God into them life from God innocent do that and they stood on their feet and great fear came on them which saw them is it over yet no and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying the two witnesses right come up hither and they'll send it up to heaven in the cloud and their enemies behold them you say it won't be a lot of repentance who will it do any good you send gifts around and all of you Rejoice because your enemy's gone and all at once he raised it up from the dead you think it won't be screaming and hollering and trying to repent but it wouldn't do any good no dance when they're going to cry from the rocks to fall on them that we ran over in Revelation why because in the same hour there was a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake they were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were frightened and gave glory to the god of Heaven I want to say it this morning and only seven thousand two hundred thousand died just recently over there but you see the Bible is specific the part of the city fell in seven thousand goes there is your truth are you following me I love it like that the word that you can look at it and see it and comprehend see Jesus saw these things and he spoke of it yep Matthew 24. and we covered this morning Jesus spoke of this great six seals and he was writing so let's read that Matthew will go to 11a which is paragraph 184 or 185 of The Sixth Seal it's perfectly turned right back over see what Jesus said here in Matthew 24 29 listen after this this Eichmann case since you're working immediately after the tribulation of those days which is the minor tribulation we're going through now the pre-tribulation immediately after the tribulation is no day no say shall the sun be darkened the moon shall not shall not give her life Stars shall fall from Heaven the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and watched and then there's the Earth shall appear the sign what other son of man in heaven and they shall see and they that then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with great power and Glory and he'll send forth his angels and they will gather with the trumpet but now we were this morning talking about the Luke 17 30. why would it be brought in about the son of man in the end time see then we know the message is brought To Us by the prophet of God who had the son of man Ministry but then it's going to leave us and go to Israel brother said that that anointing off of the Gentile bride will go to Israel he says Israel I'm quoting if you want to eat he said Israel will see God coming after you and I and thanks they're coming after them let's go the son of man what is the sign of the son of man we know the son of man does not step on Earth until the millennial reign in a Corporal body you agree with that statement do you need it it's in the Millennium when he's standing on Earth in that Corporal body yes right all right so this this is not a Corporal body this is through the two prophets right because they're bringing the son of man ministry right that's it good around said when I saw that he said I got up and walked out of the room why would you talk back he said they have the power to shut heaven then call down plagues he said God they have the word of the Lord we'll get back on that one when the prophet said he went out of the room why don't you think he could see what was in his ministry don't you see he knew what was taking place in his ministry there through the two prophets won't be a televised uh picture in the sky oh the son of man is what we want to get all into that and try to visualize which is making sense to me you know that brother Reynolds says he won't be here in a Corporal body for the money but he says he'll be visible Among Us and raise the dead and we're going to rapture now is that a contradiction no visible to you and I won't be a great big halo son of man in the skies give me two prophets standing there with the word that's right I didn't close heaven to do what they want to it's not the son of man it's the sound of the son of man the son of man it's a word make flesh yes right them two Prophets are so close you know that run around and even said they were that sexy you need that quote Rich you feel good there's a lot of things in there you know what about you know what do I encourage you to do I'm encourage you to read to see a book to see what he's talking to you even through the symbols of the one two three and four well did you just know the Antichrist yep I wanted to know Jesus Christ in our Homer in opposition of the Antichrist I encourage you to read the seal book even told you a word that I got into the sealed and read them when I got to the seventh seal it seemed so much that he was speaking of his own self do I begin to have problems I knew it was my problems not his if it was God's Prophet so I went back to the church age book and I studied it for years and years but then when I began to see what it is right you're listening while ago you call the key of it when fifth seal and six seal opens he's just simply telling us what that is right you only do them with symbols right amen see they see according to Matthew which brother Reynolds is going down and read it see just exactly comparing what Jesus said in Matthew 24 and what the Revelation here Revelator here open up the new Sixth Seal is just exactly and Jesus was speaking of the tribulation period all right is he putting them together you could see that there's the sound of the son of man the word through two Prophets and if you'll notice on what we're reading on the scripture this is already after they're killed does that make any problem did Brother random say California would go under one day you agree with that yeah well you know that went yeah right right but is that anything to do with it no no because it will why why would it go under because he said it go under that's right he didn't say New York he didn't say Arizona he said California go under well the word has been spoken all right you cannot return unto the god void those two witnesses call down plagues in the Bible we just read fire proceeds out of their mouth and right after breathing dragons sailing no better than the Baptist Church man what's wrong with this church right it's the word out of their mouth all right amen the prophet said it would let fire in my bosom he said how can I not speak do those two prophets will call that word down they'll just whatever they call that's the way it'll be till the people just get to where they hate them laughs you know what God has to permit in two flowers to be killed because how could you kill them you ever notice about Jesus foreign what happened he didn't zap them he just turned all around well time you know what they're doing is hunting Barn right yeah the word the guy we brought out here to go off the mountain he just walked out do those two prophets cannot be touched until their things of their Ministry you know what I love about that the same Prophet said those things says Satan can't get you until God is through with you amen what are you afraid of you right Brazil you afraid to die I'm more afraid of living 's got more problems than died what'd you see he can't touch you and listen the other day to a date I love to do that down the woods you don't understand you're going to be there for hours trying to find a deer because I sleep sometimes you know but at least that's why I don't kill anyone listen to a doctor three or four tanks and I was listening to Brett random was talking the other day about those type of things life and he said he said God took a picture of you one day and said he turned around to Satan and says come on you can take it but since you can't take his life amen and I'll tell you when these two prophets could not be touched until God was through with them when he was through with him that Beast rose up and killed him God used to with you Satan can take you but until then he can't take you all right don't worry about it right can you please ruined I won't go right right well you want to hang around pure I love life but I love him but think about it now good profits during a three and a half year period claim the world with their voice right fire like out of their mouth when they speak it it's just go down let's see it you can't do nothing about it let's see they've got to be taken somewhere so they will be killed their bodies will lay in the street for three and a half days which will probably rotten pretty good with our especially and then wind up yep being resurrected brought up you stand upon the Earth and then God's voice calls them up and that's your rapture the last one that run around the spoke up to be the two witnesses going up in a ranch all right their work is finished but things are not done put us in the same hour Revelations 11 13. that was a great earthquake yeah horrible things starts happening Virginia this world and the things getting ready for the millennial reign but listen Church this is what I love about our prophet he just didn't tell us about the tribulation he just didn't tell us about the quirks the earthquakes the the Sun going into these things happening he told us go ahead and go to number 13 let's get started on a field and then he'll quit this is the Sixth Seal paragraph 317. here it is here it is in the tribulation period in your stands in prophets who has control of the word that God gives them I love that you read that sometimes you think control of the word that God gives them me is it not the spoken word all right gods they're temporarily the Emmett maturely let it work they are because Jesus said they were said you call him God sent him the word of God comes to what's the matter he's fixing to take the 144 000. out for Redemption out of the book of redemption and that's under the Seal of redemption and The Sixth Seal that's it my dear friends that's the Sixth Seal our drove mysteriously the tribulation and 144 000 is going to be called out the mysterious part is what go ahead number 14. this is the bridge between the churches and seal paragraph 23. Church goes up on the third chapter of Revelation and does not return until the 19th Chapter of Revelation therefore the church misses the tribulation I know that's contrary to pretty near every teacher I've talked to but I don't mean to be disagreeable I mean to be your brother but I must teach just as I can see it if I don't I can't put it together you see and now whether it goes up I love what he says see before the tribulation interact with the tribulation I want to go up with it and that's the main value right amen but see we don't have to go through the tribulation and when we heard these things good going to hear them again go to the next one 15. right around 79 the first seal and how can a man save that the bride of Christ goes into the tribulation I can't understand it she stuck away from the tribulation if the church had been judged lived and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless amazing question you say there's no such person jump up or sticker went down said I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven we see everybody oh look at that wonderful bumper sticker look at that wonderful bumper sticker I'm not perfect I'm just forgiving hey if you're forgiven you're perfect get a little sense right if I don't have anybody that gets me how can I be kelp right my dad's been he died in 1945. you want to try for some crime for me admitted yesterday not quite he ain't guilty did not run around and say an invisible Union it's not that you're just forgiven he said you're Justified first statement is what he says no you've never done it right amen finish it up the message saying the real you never did do it that's right who can be perfect every morning again believer okay let's read he's American such person never born again believer True Believer is cold perfectly totally seal this before God he's not trusting these works what's he trusting you in the blood Jesus died Christ had his confession drops into it now let's back up and seal you remember what we were teaching under the fifth seal the Bible says that they received white robes before now read your Bible ready to feel single he says they were given white robes before the 144 thousand to kill so then with that conclusion in mind it means I feel you don't go to the tribulation he said well that's true because he's dead she don't go to the watch when I need to show me a scripture show me a quote from Brother Brown I don't care what you think I used to play contrary too I used to think they had to go to the white throne until I read the Bible where are you gonna put that fifth sealed you into white throne for what when they already have white room my robes is eternal life the only one don't get eternal life into my Throne is going to be the foolish Mercury right right man you know 144 000 don't go to the left throne brother says they go to the Millennium and it's you next to the bride right need to quote Church Blue like about it if God don't send a foolish uh official Jew and a 144 000 to the white throne right and you say you're the bride you say you have accepted Jesus Christ as your savior you say that God has come and lived in your heart according to the Book of John it says he's sineth not because your seat remaineth in him and how can he sin the Bible says so see he that that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that would scatter sin through God will there be nothing left of it see how can that pure blood of Jesus of Christ ever let his sin pass there he cannot Jesus said to you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could we ever start the thought of being perfect but Jesus required it and in Jesus required it he's got to make a way for her yeah right and he has his own blood amen amen that's the reason we don't go to the tribulation go remain perfect he said I don't see how anybody can say that the bride he's in other Church he said because it's typing three Noah rode up and went over right right Enoch went into rapture before them for one thing ever struck Enoch went into Rapture Noah wrote up went over come back down died drunk how can you put to church the tribulation man whoa brother they'll ask you know why because you've always been taught you've been caught by organized religion amen right in the teaching they taught was we're not perfect we're just forgive we're going to have to I'm teaching I'm saying what they're teaching not the truth we're all going to have to stand at that white throne and give an account I never hear him say that happened what was that I sure heard him yeah right maybe it's gone I was listening because you know what my soul is involved in what I hear so is yours we're not going to the watchroom judgment not because we're going to sit on the throne with him isn't that wonderful to find out that truth to find out if we go to the watchroom find out we don't have to go through the tribulation to find out how perfect these man is now I've left out a whole lot but I'll wind up get it back later but I want to get one point in mind if we believe the prophet they said the bride goes up in Revelation 4 1 and not seen till 1921. all right then we don't have to go through the tribulation amen were made perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen now you remember about 20 messages ago so I guess you can't come in with that good but when it was on Revelations 5. and you know they asked a question to brother Bradley said is this the bride of Christ you remember and he said no why because his mind was thinking the bride goes up at 4-1 and not seen till 1921. he said it's Israel brother Ned Allison brother Brandon read your question over read your scripture you went back and read it he said see there I would have he said Daddy it's the bride in glory right yeah massive Pride and Glory chapter five calls us priests and kings all right already in glory he said see I was wrong God wouldn't let him say that would he because it was too much hands down because you see Church if we're not in Revelations 5 we could be in Revelation 6. right you understand the way I said that if we're not in Revelation 5 and going up in a Rapture and are sitting around the throne but all of this is taking place down here we gonna be down here that's right right you know what I mean by that what he thinks of us you don't show this globally you know what I like before he even wrote the church ages about us you agree that was about us he said in chapter one there was one standing in the midst of seven gold again to the son of man gird about the pouch for the golden girdle run around and said see there and all that was the bride before he brought anything in the Book of Revelation he showed us eternal now you tell me that ain't perfect amen I'm not looking at what I do or don't do it I'm looking at Jesus Christ he wasn't what you've done or didn't do in the Old Testament it's whether or not you believe that lamb right now everybody took a lamb up there and just throwed it down let him kill it her sins wasn't covered because God had done spoken he said I'm sick of your my nostrils of your sacrifice and offer let's set an honest in a contract heart read your Bible a man sincerely took his offering up there and laid it down and put his hands on it yep believe me they took his place God forgave him amen right but everybody took around I thought it down wasn't forgiven let's go play games we seem to be Christians or get out of this thing and leave it alone this message one day is my house I said why don't you get out of this message or get in at one I didn't know how to say it you know what his wife said you're right brother Daley needs to get in or get out because you see he was stirring up the teaching that brought around Was An Old Testament prophet in the New Testament age all of those things I was trying to hit me he's running around with an Old Testament Prophet we're still under the law but he was a new testament prophet greater than all the prophets right right he was a church age messenger he born again Christian he was Elijah the prophet and he was I ain't son of man all right man not these other man that's the Lord Jesus Christ like on these things it's a great thing to think about that we missed the tribulation amen right we don't have to go there because he's already made us cleansed and perfect let's Stand Together we're going to go into the communion no one would be worthy to take the communion no one is worthy to take the communion except they be born again right my Prophet said it's only for the born-again believer
