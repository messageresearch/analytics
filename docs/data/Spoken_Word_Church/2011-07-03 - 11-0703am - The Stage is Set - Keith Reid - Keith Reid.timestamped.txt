[37:22] uh Network set up of helping some of the
[37:24] missionaries in the foreign field
[37:26] sometimes
[37:27] we're very proud of that and very proud
[37:28] of what God has done for us for 40 years
[37:32] and mainly because he has been with us
[37:34] and taking care of us and giving us the
[37:37] the honor and Glory of being his
[37:39] children and keeping us out of the
[37:42] doctrines that are floating in the
[37:44] message and all the things and sure
[37:46] Satan has tried everything he could but
[37:48] yet we're still here believing the same
[37:51] message and walking in the same light of
[37:53] the hour that we started in and thanking
[37:56] God for all of the things we were
[37:57] counting up last night there was seven
[37:59] here last night that were part of the uh
[38:03] Regional you know ones who began uh here
[38:06] in the church cuz when we started there
[38:08] was five families that was brother Mo
[38:10] and his family brother Cunningham and
[38:12] his brother Robert Holland brother uh
[38:15] Robert Lewis and my family and all and
[38:17] we you know we were trying to serve the
[38:19] Lord most of you know the first service
[38:21] we had five cars parked out up in the
[38:23] front cuz the back was just a jungle of
[38:26] the headge stuffff and we uh you know
[38:29] there was a car came down the road
[38:31] running about 85 mph about half on the
[38:34] road and he ran into all five cars and
[38:36] total lost brother Mo's car and mine and
[38:40] everything else but you know uh we
[38:42] parked right back that afternoon there
[38:44] was one person and I won't call names
[38:46] but one drove down in the hole but the
[38:48] rest of us parked our second vehicle in
[38:50] the same place that we were parked on
[38:52] that one and Company would come a lot of
[38:54] times and go up the streets and park
[38:56] around around and we just you know just
[38:58] talk in a minute while the ones are
[39:00] coming in but we appreciate it and
[39:03] appreciate God being with us and a man
[39:05] we've thought a lot about it cuz there
[39:07] was a man came out here that was the
[39:09] mayor of the city and he said uh you
[39:11] don't need to be out here in front on
[39:13] the building uh parking we'll clean out
[39:16] the back back here far year we were just
[39:18] renting then and and he volunteered
[39:21] brother said we'll pay for the gravel
[39:22] and if you'll fix it well you know the
[39:24] man lived about 1 month and passed away
[39:26] so maybe that would be his uh you know
[39:30] deed he done that would be to help God
[39:32] nobody didn't ask him and and everything
[39:34] he just volunteered so we we appreciate
[39:37] it it's been a long run but yet very
[39:39] very enjoyable I wouldn't change any of
[39:42] it because that it would change my
[39:44] character and my nature and my ways and
[39:46] we appreciate it we got an announcement
[39:48] from Brother Ernie villain noo that uh
[39:52] there is a brother in uh Russia in
[39:54] Siberia big long name I I can't
[39:56] pronounce but he goes to a church in
[39:59] Russia and his name is brother Boris b o
[40:02] r i s but he was a minor and got hurt in
[40:05] a mine accident and they gave him about
[40:08] a 2% chance of survival but he's already
[40:11] lost one eye and everything and fighting
[40:14] for his life so just remember that and
[40:17] just pray that the Lord would touch him
[40:19] you know and the one that Terence
[40:20] mentioned about Dar and Iran we don't
[40:22] know they were they had already said
[40:24] that they were going to uh facing the
[40:27] death penalty and they refuse his
[40:29] objection so let's just pray the Lord
[40:31] would be with these and you know and
[40:34] help everything and and take care of
[40:36] everything and all of that but we we
[40:38] appreciate all that let's let's sing

[52:25] he has such sweet Spirit we just pray
[52:28] that God would be with him and the
[52:30] children at this time and then also um
[52:34] just about 2 months ago brother Louis
[52:36] daughter um she's Galia she's um 10
[52:40] years old she was dnos with sugar
[52:43] diabetes and um she' spend some time in

[53:39] hear more of these things but the
[53:42] bride's Redemption amen is secure amen
[53:46] some of us won't make the change um but
[53:48] you know what we want to make sure is
[53:50] that our names are written in the Lamb's
[53:53] Book of Life amen we want to do all in
[53:56] our power Amen to keep the sacred words
[54:00] of almighty God this morning also I just

[54:04] church here in Lula uh
[54:07] congratulations and all the years that I
[54:10] me you've been together and um last
[54:13] night you know I reflected on that as a
[54:15] family unit together and um you know we
[54:19] cannot take from the fact that you know
[54:22] only men of God um as over come the
[54:26] fleet of being of holding a church
[54:29] together for all these years and we
[54:31] certainly thank God you know that you
[54:33] are Overcomers in this time am because
[54:36] it's a hard time to overcome but you are
[54:39] certainly Overcomers in this time and we
[54:41] certainly thank God for you all and for
[54:44] the church here in Lula and um you know
[54:46] Brother Sam was saying how small you are
[54:48] in the small place but I I think over
[54:51] the years since I I've met you all you
[54:53] have accomplished great things might be
[54:57] not just here in America but other
[54:59] places in the world and I think the
[55:01] rewards are in heaven for that which you
[55:04] have done because we can't do more than
[55:07] our faith would allow us to do and I
[55:10] thank God for your Fai amen and H linon
[55:13] we are indebted to you for many things
[55:16] and over the years that you have done

[55:21] the rest of
[55:24] Jama
[55:27] amen praise
[55:29] God that's all right I I use this
[55:44] one it's not the system it's me I move
[55:47] so much really but um I tell them I'm
[55:51] kind of emotional I'm
[55:54] Jamaican
[55:56] amen so let us stand on our feet this
[55:58] morning as we look to the word of God
[56:02] praise God just thank God for his word
[56:06] this morning and for the message that is
[56:09] revealed to us in this day amen I'm glad
[56:12] to be identified that's right with the
[56:14] word of God glory for our day amen and
[56:17] to be living in the day when the son of
[56:20] man is revealed among his people I'd
[56:23] like us to turn our Bibles to the Book
[56:25] of Revelation CH
[56:27] 14 I'm going to read from verse 9 to
[56:30] verse
[56:32] 12 you know I believe certainly as I'll
[56:35] speak this morning the stage is set yeah
[56:39] and um you know we we've I think it was
[56:42] all over the world just a few uh weeks
[56:44] ago that there was a prediction that a
[56:47] certain date there was going to be the
[56:49] ending of the world and people were
[56:51] nervous they were perturbed they didn't
[56:53] know what to do really and you know
[56:55] people come and wherever they know a
[56:57] Christian or a minister they come to ask
[56:59] you I mean do you believe because what
[57:01] they really want is not to know if you
[57:04] believe what this guy said they they
[57:05] want to know if this is the
[57:08] time because if if you don't believe
[57:11] it's a time that they can go on and live
[57:13] the life they live amen so you you know
[57:16] I I I don't want to discredit the guy
[57:18] really I don't tell them well it never
[57:20] it can't be I said listen it could be
[57:23] the day before right so the essence of
[57:25] it is that you ought to get ready they
[57:28] don't like that kind of answer really
[57:30] you know they want somebody to say oh
[57:32] well he's a fool and um it's wrong and
[57:34] it's a false prophecy you don't need to
[57:36] I mean hey these things will
[57:39] happen brother bam says because they
[57:42] feel the anointing of the
[57:45] time
[57:46] hello and and so we also believe that
[57:49] the hour is lit amen we ain't going to
[57:51] put a day on it we ain't going to put a
[57:54] mean a certain day but we know the hour
[57:56] is late amen and uh they're feeling the
[57:59] pull of the hour and you're going to see
[58:02] more of this coming in but it's telling
[58:04] you and I Hallelujah to get grounded in
[58:07] your faith because we're getting out of
[58:09] here amen praise God let us bad our
[58:14] gracious God and our father Lord we
[58:15] thank you for Lord the day that we're
[58:18] living in God Lord that the prophet one
[58:21] time said it's the most deceiving age
[58:23] that there is but Lord God to the bride
[58:26] it's the most glorious time that oh God
[58:29] we could live Lord I I know that Isaiah
[58:31] and Jeremiah and then they would love to
[58:33] live in the day that we're living in and
[58:35] to see the word that is revealed for
[58:37] this day that the prophecies that
[58:39] they've spoken of that Lord God they
[58:41] They Carried the impulse of that
[58:44] anointing uh Lord deliver the word and
[58:47] the anointing left them but Lord God

[58:51] things that was said Lord what the day

[58:57] the world it's going on just naturally

[1:00:29] and he shall be tormented with fire and
[1:00:32] brimstone in the presence of the Holy
[1:00:35] Angels and in the presence of the lamb

[1:16:40] right right and oh you said oh but we're
[1:16:43] a great nation one nation under God oh
[1:16:46] but you consume more right than you grow

[1:20:18] walk through China the people has this
[1:20:20] ideology they said we're going to be the
[1:20:23] next world power yeah we're going to be
[1:20:25] the next world power amen they're

[1:20:31] their aspiration as a nation right Heen
[1:20:34] in the pride of America they said Oh all
[1:20:37] the world Wonder after heren they want
[1:20:40] to be in this great nation but Breen I
[1:20:43] tell youen the world is coming to a
[1:20:45] place that there's only one place that
[1:20:47] will be great to be in have your name in
[1:20:51] the Lamb's Book of life amen hallelujah
[1:20:55] thank you Lord amen amen oh brother
[1:20:58] Brandon amen made some utterance he said
[1:21:02] Rome Hallelujah has acquired nearly all
[1:21:05] the gold Supply yeah around the world
[1:21:08] and will destroy the monetary system
[1:21:10] right and you said how will Rome how
[1:21:13] could Rome destroy the monetary system
[1:21:16] because if the West hasn't got the power
[1:21:19] of the influence of the world then she
[1:21:22] can't hold it right the pound standard
[1:21:26] came down because people start losing
[1:21:29] confidence in the pound on and Brethren
[1:21:32] even the Canadian dollar is stronger
[1:21:35] than the us today oh right do you know
[1:21:39] that amen and soen as soon as they begin
[1:21:43] to lose confidence in the dollar what
[1:21:47] the world will do they said we cannot
[1:21:49] beg our currency to assist them that is
[1:21:53] failing and so the only system that is
[1:21:56] constant is the gold standard so I tell
[1:22:00] you we're getting back to the gold
[1:22:02] standard and when we do who's going to
[1:22:05] have the power the prophet says Rome has
[1:22:09] a
[1:22:10] goal exactly absolutely oh the stage is
[1:22:13] all set am amen right Hallelujah Glory
[1:22:19] you know Hallelujah communism Heen
[1:22:22] brother said was just a tool yes used
[1:22:26] for a time but where is communism today
[1:22:30] it's all gone right and the economy of
[1:22:33] Russia is a market economy the economy
[1:22:36] of China is a market economy and if you
[1:22:39] look at the scales of the world of who
[1:22:42] the exporting nations are America is way
[1:22:46] down oh yeah because as far as
[1:22:50] consumption they're on the top yeah but
[1:22:53] in production they're are the bottom
[1:22:56] exactly that's right amen
[1:22:58] hallelujah amen so he said Rome he's
[1:23:02] going to call in the gold standard
[1:23:05] and Hallelujah then what will happen is
[1:23:09] that Europe has
[1:23:12] 37% of the world's economy the United
[1:23:17] Europe and there's only about four
[1:23:20] countries in that that does not use the
[1:23:23] euro yeah and one of them is England and
[1:23:25] Norway and a few of them really because
[1:23:28] they are proud of their currency yeah
[1:23:31] but when the gold standard coming it's
[1:23:34] going to get Pig back to the European
[1:23:37] dollar right and then the consumption of
[1:23:40] America you realize that your inflation
[1:23:43] is going to move far above what the
[1:23:46] people can afford because they're going
[1:23:48] to trade for a dollar that is higher in
[1:23:51] currency value than they
[1:23:53] own so bre you can see the systems of
[1:23:56] the world is

[2:01:23] person but I tell you I came in you know
[2:01:26] 1985 that's a long
[2:01:28] time and I've seen many
[2:01:31] things and you know I'm not standing

[2:01:35] that I knew that belong to the message
[2:01:38] no sir come on if I was looking at their
[2:01:40] lives and the things that they do yeah
[2:01:42] maybe I would be discouraged and I'll be
[2:01:44] back in the Baptist church today amen
[2:01:48] but I tell when God called me by his
[2:01:50] word amen there was something that God
[2:01:52] did to me right that I know that this
[2:01:55] was a call from where I was and what I
[2:01:58] was to the word of almighty God and you
[2:02:01] know I tell you over the years you know
[2:02:03] I hear them said where you know this
[2:02:05] brother son so that brother so so
[2:02:07] Brethren I tried
[2:02:09] always always I struggle to find truth
[2:02:13] come on I'm not afraid of the Gospel of
[2:02:17] Jesus Christ amen I'm not afraid to be
[2:02:20] challenged upon what I believe no I'm
[2:02:23] not challenged to dig deep in the word
[2:02:25] of God am me I'm Adventure on a limb
[2:02:28] leave me alone because I've seen
[2:02:31] something that I'm going
[2:02:33] after hello I believe that this word is
[2:02:36] going to give me a body a change and I'm
[2:02:39] going after that change are you there
[2:02:41] with me I'm not here because my parents
[2:02:44] believe in it my parents never believe
[2:02:46] it there's none of my family that is in
[2:02:49] it but God called me miraculous to the
[2:02:52] word of God and Bren every day that I
[2:02:55] live and the more knowledge I have I see
[2:02:58] that this word is a
[2:03:00] truth they said when you find the truth
[2:03:02] you got to follow it
[2:03:04] everywhere amen you know the oddest
[2:03:07] thing is when we stand and we declare
[2:03:09] that we find the truth and tomorrow
[2:03:12] we're no longer in
[2:03:15] right hello
[2:03:17] somebody but I'm persuaded this morning
[2:03:20] that he's able to keep that which I
[2:03:23] committed unto him again today thank you
[2:03:26] Lord BR after everything is in place
[2:03:29] right Hallelujah you know there's no new
[2:03:32] happening around the world that we can
[2:03:34] say we didn't know that was going to
[2:03:36] happen no sir that's right the stages
[2:03:39] are being set the things that brother B
[2:03:42] said he said it in a small way and when
[2:03:45] he said we didn't understand what he was
[2:03:47] saying but the more we look is the more
[2:03:49] we realize that the prophet was seeing
