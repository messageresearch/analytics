didn't have power I told him I said they was powering the blood but they wouldn't let power in those electric lines this morning some guys decided to I told them it's Joe that's what they get for working on Sunday some guys was trying to cut a tree back here and it fell on the felling the lines brother Joe went out and did some investigating and and found a lady fussing them out it's on Sundays for the fussing fussing them out Saturday it would have been a different story but today it's fussing fussing them out so that was what the problem was that's what you get for working on Sunday amen Benigno a good man out to the Lord good to be back everything's good and cool and ready to go and we all right we got your Bibles let's turn to revelation 6 we had a real good time broke laws that tell everybody hello good to see each and every one of you we got everybody back I think well John and Myles not back I thought they'd be back this Sunday but maybe it'd be here Wednesday night next Sunday so well get them back from Virginia and then we're gonna lock the doors and keep them here so long man so just really enjoy everybody being here I enjoy the new ones you need you look at some places and you see that people are falling away and seems like we're gathering a few extras so that's all right because where the carcass is it didn't say the buzzards would be gathered no the buzzards eat the old stuff we're eating the good new stuff we're eating the fresh meat the fresh kill of the word of God really been enjoying we're brother Dale has been bringing on the the new birth because we need we need that and then coming up with the with the virtues and and you know I was thinking when he was preaching Wednesday night I thought man you know we are all sheep the Word of God said we're sheep so we have to be led that's what God said you know why because he knew what we would act like if we didn't have a shepherd a man we'd be all scattered and we'd be we'd be like herding cats brother direct weaving you know I've ever tried to hurt a cat's kinda like pushing the rope you know you can't get it to go anywhere and and that's the way it would be but now we have some sort of structure because being a human being we work better under structure an office and somebody you say oh I hate that person being my boss well you know what somebody probably hates you being the boss but somebody's got to be the boss but God is a loving boss God we we serve Him not out of out of half - I hope I hope is this God that we serve because we want to amen come to what he's done for us and and this this seal here that we're fixing to go into number four I've been studying of course last week we didn't do much but I'm just kind of sitting around thinking about things and you know when you come to the fourth seal and you come to the rapture that's it for us kind of that's the finality we're gonna read some things today where I had not read it before where it tells us that it's the end even in covering the fourth seal so in this fourth seal let's really try to study it because you know what if we miss it we missed the Raptor if we missed the fourth seal we missed the rapture that seal now we know it opens later because the man of sin has got to be incarnate and we don't see that but remember we're so close so close to where we see all these things getting ready to happen I was telling him downstairs you know this new this new guy that they're appointing for the Supreme Court he's a Catholic but he's a Jesuit Catholic he's a Jesuit priest out of Notre Dame well maybe not you don't say priest but he was a he is the order of Jesuit and he is the new Supreme Court nominee so it's coming down to the end it's coming down to where that you know what even the highest court of the land you know are mostly Catholics and Jews not want to think only one Protestant on the whole bench that John Roberts can but you see how its swinging to everything swinging away from us and taken of course we know that it's like brother Ernie sent me a message the other day he said aren't we glad and this is true we're glad to already have heard tomorrow's news we've already heard tomorrow's news we know what's gonna happen there's 300 something million people in this United States are going what are we gonna do if this one gets elected what we gonna do if isn't disliked what we're gonna do if he gets up so what we knows like Bodell said about the flag we salute the flag I honor the flag of United States you know what cuz it gives me freedom but now I know what it's gonna end up in but I have nothing to do with that and man we are under the flag of what they're Almighty and then we live under that flag but we do under the flag of the United States no doubt these idiots that don't like to to honor the flag they oughta send them somewhere where there's no freedom you ought to send them over there and stay here you know fend for yourself if football uniforms wouldn't do good in Iraq promise you that so anyhow revelation 6 I hope nobody's watching online from from the NFL I know they ain't nobody watching online so anyway it doesn't matter so I'm not worried about anybody know anything about what's going on but like I said truly though doesn't it make you feel better that you do know tomorrow's news we know how this thing is going to end up now we may not know the names of the people but we know the spirit we know what's gonna happen it's gonna all head up in religion amen it's gonna all head up in religion that and we'll read when I read this Sunday but Wednesday night brother branham said that the powers in this 4-cyl are political religious and demonic those three powers are going to be made known in this end time by a bride just us being here is what's gonna make all this happen so and just being here today is keeping all the wrath off of us anywhere or not off us but off of the world so but revelation 6 we're going to kind of review a little bit since it's been a few weeks Oh revelation 6 verse 1 let's bow our heads Lord Jesus today Lord we pray that you would come among us Lord in a special way him just open our eyes and let us be all tender-hearted and and received from You Father we don't want to have stony hearts or our hearts made out of wood but you gave us a heart of flesh and you are the one that decided that you were going to come down and live in that human flesh and Lord you made a way it's called Redemption we know that you before the foundation of the world knew who would or who wouldn't but we had to come down here Lord and we had to act the part out we had to act this out Lord the way you saw it but it's Redemption Redemption Redemption if without you Lord we would not be we couldn't even be redeemed without you father so now come and be with us take care of us give us a word to speak to the people and give the here is a revelation father because only you can do that save the Lost heal the sick be with the ones on the highways brother Anderson and all the ones Lord just take care of them bless us and take care of us in the further of this service in Jesus name we pray amen all right let's read we're gonna read all first four seals and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold of white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and the crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering in to conquer and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him to set thereon to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given to him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see always come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine I want you to take that hold on to that because we're gonna read that again in a minute alright and when he had opened the fourth seal here's one we're coming to today we won't get into it much but we'll just kind of hit it and then pick it up on Wednesday and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword with hunger with death and with the beasts of the earth you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word me and the construction crew in here is gonna get all this stuff together hey by all rights a man so this is probably the last time you say Amen till you wake back up after we're finished so anyhow thank you buddy you don't want to talk brother claw I was gonna have y'all do I'm gonna buy about 80 bowling balls okay eight pounders and I'm gonna have you sit and hold that bowling ball over your feet you'll get it in a minute because when you go to sleep okay anyway give something hold onto you don't want that bowling ball hits your feet revelations tells us though what we've been going through is is that down to the church ages and that's what I want you to see today down to the church ages there is a continuity between what God is doing the Devils doing now the devil he's changing he's changing it's like well I like what brother Branham says and we'll read it in the fourth seal later on but Satan starts with the white horse goes red goes black goes to pale he's trying his best to thwart God and try to you know try to keep his God's people unbalanced God just gets on a white horse and just keeps riding a white horse amen the white horse we see that that God rides and we're gonna see him in the Millenium we're gonna see him in white we're gonna see him in a future home he's coming back what riding in on a white horse it was the same horse he started with Satan's got four he's trying his best to do what he can to get rid of us huh I want you to look now in Joel to because we kind of subtitled this today I will restore but we're going to kind of continue on that line because remember now keep this in the back of your mind if I say if for your purpose if the rapture takes place in the fourth seal then redemption is truly over for the Gentiles all right because remember these four seals happen in this dimension the fifth dimension when that seal I'm sorry the fifth seal when it breaks whether Brown says we go into another dimension because what he had to do is the souls that was under the altar were not in the first three dimensions I don't know what dimensions then doesn't matter but he had pop I mean John had to go into another dimension to see those dead Saints but they were already gone and then he then he I mean just two outstanding revelation because brother Brown says we thought those were the the dead Saints the dead Saints can't be in that fifth seal amen because he said we take a rapture in the fourth seal there's nobody in that dimension the sixth dimension is emptied out there's nobody there so I mean what a great revelation it all down to but that's always been in the Bible it's always been in the Bible they hadn't changed nothing's changed in the Bible it's just our what that guy that dude in the first seal or in the first church age he starts eating at the word and he's eat it down now to wear false doctrine everywhere all right that okay but see the continent you can as I was telling them in Oklahoma look at the continuity of God he doesn't jump around God's words true never has to be changed it's not like the Mormon Bible it's changed like 500 and sometimes in in 500 years how you going to trust something like that because it was and it's not and now it back is again any weapon God's Word doesn't change God's Word is true and we're going to read here and I'm going to let brother branham explain from the fifth seal how that all these are plays so that you just think it's not just me placing them but that you'll see how these things work and we read it because it'll be kind of a long reading but let's turn to Joel I want you to watch something excuse me Joel 2:23 its be glad then you children of Zion Oh who's that that's us alright that's us God's talking to me and you and rejoicing the Lord your God for he I've given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month that's today you're getting the teaching rain and you're getting the revelation rain or the harvest rain you're getting it right now today so that Scripture is not outdated it may be in the Old Testament but you sitting here today have made it you have made it new you have made it all come together because Joel said I will restore well now when Joel was there there was no restoration oh sure there rest they restored natural buildings what we've been talking about in the Bible study in in Romans Paul covers circumcision and uncircumcision does not matter if you're circumcised in your flesh or not why does it matter but it does in the heart but God couldn't get in the heart in the Old Testament so we had to accept Abraham but the problem is they were standing there going we be Abraham's seed we we're of the circumcision and Paul said look how long was he in circumcision a long time when God called him even the faith of Abraham started in uncircumcision if you ever thought of that amen that read Romans four God told him or Paul told him God told him through Paul then hey your circumcision is fine when it was there for the moment but now since God came down human flesh and died on the cross now it's the fleshly tables of the heart even the Old Testament tells you that so so Abraham it wasn't the circumcision or not circumcision it was we're not we're not children of Abraham by a flash we're children of Abraham my wife faith you and I have to have so much faith to believe something that there's never happened before then a sinner you said all it happened with Jesus Jesus wasn't a sinner he got a body changed a man but he wasn't a sinner a man we're sinners born wrong get a new birth to make us right again and that we're gonna take a body change you gonna have to believe that amen now we know Abraham had a body change but it was temporary he died when we receive a body change we don't die amen so how will restore the floors now look the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and all we just read that in the third seal we're in the third seal right here wine and oil together all right talking about what the Holy Ghost cuz look there is no restoration without the Holy Ghost you can build a temple then knock it down you build a house then knock it down but you can't get the new birth and get knocked down sure you and get knocked down but you can't lose your salvation you can't lose your eternal life and then so I will restore so what God is going to restore he's gonna restore it and it's not gonna fall again this restoration is not that we're not going back to the first church age we're not going back to the third church age we're not going back to the fifth or sixth term we're not even going back to the seven churches because we're in the seven churches in time but your soul better not being there because if your soul is in the seventh the seventh church age I'm going to read to you what you're going to get ain't good but I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm caterpillar Pama were my great army which I sent among you all right so he's got a restorer because he sent the army among us okay he has to do a work of restoration and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied see when you restore now you think you look at all this what brother Branham preached on the the the restoration of the broad tree pretty awful what this bug does he sway the fellowship and you understands that you know that's a sermon for another time but it's not good what this thing does this bug eats but you say that you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied there's a restoration coming back up where that we're going to be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed I'm not ashamed to be living in his church are you shame to be living interchange no no no you wouldn't survive in another Church age because you're built for this church age you're built for this time amen and you shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I'm the Lord your God and none else in my people shall never be ashamed and they shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters prophesy old men dream dreams young men see visions watch this and also upon the servants and upon the head and maids in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke Sun shall be turned darkness the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come now read Malachi Malachi 4 what does it say I will restore the hearts of the fathers and children's children father's what less that's mighty earth with a curse the great terrible day of the Lord all right and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered were the only people that know his name because we're going to see I'm building up to this fourth seal because the fourth seal names come up death and hell and all these things for a mountain Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the Lord has said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call so is everybody all right so this is going to not just restore Israel we know Israel's going to be restored but remember Israel is not restored until we leave hey man Israel's not gods not even dealing with Israel as a nation until we leave all right then he will restore he will bring back all those things but he's not going to bring it back like they thought cuz what did the disciples in mount and Matthew they said you're gonna restore this no didn't in Acts when Jesus was getting ready to the sin are you gonna restore the temple say they all got to build the natural building thing we gotta quit worrying about the natural building and worry about the spiritual building of God amen so now let's read I want to go back and this is the fifth seal but since we haven't done this in a while go back and show you the white red black and let brother branham tell you all these things now let's go with the first one here number one this is on the fifth seal if you want to read it yourself you can now we're gonna do a little bit of reading today just to kind of get everybody caught back up all right brother bottom on the fifth seal now what he's doing how many of you noticed that brother branham he really don't spend a lot of time on the seal that the day the seals preached he reviews he'll review for an hour and a half about the fourth seal and then he'll tell you what fifth day lives in any quits then on the sixth seal he'll tell you what the fifth seal is about an hour and a half and then he takes a little bit of six sealing any quiz all right so this is the fifth seal but he's talking about four bags so that's what we want to talk about is the fourth seal by now we see that the Devils changing a four beast meant that power they was revealed to the one power he revealed to the world and how they ended in this pale death horse now let's look at God's powers of these beasts to combat them that's what we've always told you about right we told you that God sends out an anointing and Satan has won there - all right so now the first beast of God he went out to meet the antichrist with the antichrist spirit when it said it was just his teaching now remember when the Antichrist first wrote he was in a teaching ministry the Antichrist wrote first in a teaching ministry remember in the first church days the church agent was a saying it was a saying a saying went out this and that and the other and all the things right now and watch the one that me that went out to meet him was the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah all right watch the Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word they had the pure word the first three Church ages and then brother Brent said they should never went to Nicaea when was Nicaea right here they went to Nicaea that's when that bug started to eating and man that bug started to eating the word down all right and watch the one that went to meet him the line the line of the tribe of Judah which is the word when his false teaching went forth the true word went forth to me and look how garden God was there because he knew that thing was going to start he knew what it was going to fish but look he knew what the beginning of that thing was just little sayings so we had to have a fivefold ministry that was on the scene that was preaching hey let there was no prophets oh yeah Paul was a prophet a man Paul was a prophet but before Paul Peter what in a major profit Paul was a major profit right but before Paul between between Peter and Paul there was several years in there that the church got established he said how you know that because Paul was persecuting them there was a church already established for Paul wouldn't had anything to persecute Paul was persecuting the Christians let me be real plain he was part of that wild horse rider to begin with he was he he said all that was false and he warned them all dead in there right so that white horse had attached himself to Paul that's hard to say but they all attached to us too you know all right Jesus is the only one he couldn't attach yourself to hey man it's even even brother branham even all of us did had a little false idea you think that came from God a false doctrine we'll never has never come from God ever so if you've had to say I'm sorry for what I taught then that was not God right so we just but now what brother Brown said he said he said hey yeah I would have been very wrong if I had preached it the way I thought it right they said that on the first set watch the one meet him what's the line why that line was bold Paul look at Apollo look at leisure he lifts them that's the reason we had an arrhenius Irina's that stood up one day and said I don't even want to be in the same room with that sir in theist guy that faults teaching he didn't want to be in the same room with him all right Anna Polycarp and these fellows st. Martin when that Antichrist was riding with his false teaching God sent his teaching out the word the Lion of the tribe of Judah that's why you had your alpha bride and your meager brides got to be the same the words got to come back in power like it was back then plus the opening of the seals plus the opening of the seals amen what to show Iranians couldn't say well I'm part of sila number one Bible wouldn't even written at that time and then but what do you do he got an inspiration from God I'll read you a quote here I found brother Branham it was really good and it really I'm talking I've been talking about compartmentalizing will brother Brown compartmentalize right here and he'll tell you about it he just says he put it in the box well that's the same thing when you compartmentalize you put this in a box you put this in the box and you put this in the box all right you file this you file this if this is Susan's filing this is Donny's file you put them in a different box for Susan to get mad that's the reason we had an re-center Polycarp and these fellows st. Martin when that Antichrist was riding with his false teaching God sent his teaching out the word the line of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest in the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to what manifests himself which is the word that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions in power roll up or sorry roll down it's because it was the Living Word in the form of the Lion of the tribe of Judah riding out to combat that amen now you get it he sends his power Antichrist God sends his the word Antichrist false teaching the true teaching went with that to combat it now that's the first one that was the first church that pathology that went to meet him now the second beast that the Antichrist and that was a red beef which was a road owned was to take peace from the earth in war now the second one that went to combat him was the odds so we got everything right the white which is the lion the Ox which is the fourth church age goes watch him he'll tell you right here now the second one the one that was the ox beast the Ox means they labor a beast of burden now if you could just stop a minute let me let me make sure to see this that's the kind of might be a little puzzling to you but let us now he goes to what fight our church age one two three fourth our church age which is the dark ages so he places it right exactly where it's supposed to be all right fight IRA it was a laboring Church we read that into the angel the Church of thought Tyre these things saith the son of God you got the hives like flames of fire feet like fine brass I know that works see becoming all works now see because that's the one who's riding with them that's brother branham's quote and the charity and service and faith and patience and the last to be more than the first aren't goat keep going up I don't know why you put them gaps in there see that shows that the tyrant aged after the Antichrist got settled down ain't coming to the thought ironies the little church could do nothing but just simply labor to the dark ages the Christians just said I'm a Christian then they died the life expectancy of a Christian in that day and that 68 million of them it wasn't very long all right but you know what that was the spirit of the age because I'm fixing to read through right here what brother Aaron said about it and another thing the Ox is a beast of sacrifice see they gave their life just as freely as they could give them in the Dark Ages a thousand years they're the Catholicism control the world and they just went right in yes or no they don't mind dying if it was death that's all right and they went and died in anyway the very spirit of the age all right keep going up and now I want to show you this right here keep going he's facing the compartmentalize he stops here and makes he stops all that and goes to paragraph 140 I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by that right that's the only thing they can work by so he gives them a box he sets the box in there for church agencies alright this is the this is the sermon you're going to get this is the person you're going to get to preach it this is the characteristic of that age and this is what if you overcome this is what you're going to get now we know there's overlapping but but remember the first church 3:3 Church ages didn't give their life as freely as they did in that because what the spirit if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them now will prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church respond to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else couldn't do nothing else they had to respond like brother Dale saying your your leaders that come down through the office of apostle prophet pastors teachers evangelists they were in all these places and they preached a sermon and we don't take while I'm if we took Luther's sermon and preached it today we could all go over to the Buffalo well I won't say that go over to the beer joint and have a beer and smoke pot right and we've been alright because that's what Martin Luther had but that was in this church age that was in this box but that box was sealed away Holy Ghost but that box was sealed away and they're waiting on us because they only got a dip of the Holy Ghost they got a part of it amen cuz I want to show you something now in just a minute when we get to our church age all right you ready now now the first was a line that roared that pure unadulterated word the second inside tyre was the Ox it was a burden a beast of burden pardon me it was also official beast and wasn't exactly the poor little Church of Rome that settled down there to be a thousand years of dark ages anything didn't profess to be a Roman Church was put to death and they had to labor going from place to place now that's under the second seal that's the red horse or the Ox now let's go to number three all right still in the fifth seal he continues about five pages of reading that he really he's reviewing kind of what we're doing now now the third beast that went out from the devil was this black horse now the third beast that went out power from God to combat him to combat the power of the black horse was a man cunning smart with the wisdom of God that's what we just got through look like ah man the black horse comes out remember we talked about excuse me about the blackness and about if you're at that light and you be darkness that man's a man is listening man's the one that came up with these denominations not God now God allowed those things to happen but he didn't from the beginning want to do that that's why I went from a saying to a deed to a doctrine it became a doctrine right here saying a deed they had to do these things or they got killed or and then what happened what's the problem the problem that wasn't enough power I don't say there was enough power in the word there wasn't enough power that was released so there's always power in the word but there was a power that that wasn't released why because he had to restore I had to go in the ground we know Jesus went in the ground over here amen Rose became the power of the church he stills the power of the church still was the power church in this stage but there wasn't much for the work troops went back in the ground and then it went back in the ground and what I will restore had to come out of that dark age by the intelligence of man but what did man do man didn't trust in God to trusted herself we'll make a Baptist in the Methodist and a pen hey that was the same back here but it was the same it didn't have a lot of power deed then it became what a doctrine listen we live by a doctrine brother Brown said a church without a doctrine on church they meant so we have a doctrine here but we believe it's the truth not false but you know what so does the bad so does the Methodist so does the Pentecost so does the Presbyterian they all believe they're right or they wouldn't be going to them churches of course I know some of them now boy you see I don't know about you but you hear some mumbling going out in the denominational world we're tired of this we're tired of that we don't want to hear any more of this why are we still doing this why you know why they feel the pull of the aged they feel the pull of this age that we are we are what we fill the pull actually I want to say this today we are the pull we are the pull that's pulling because we're going to pull the grunt people dead people out of the ground we're gonna pull those Saints up you know not me with my you know more my chest stuck out it's going to be God through us but you know what it's going to be that we believe that that's happening see because I was thinking about this the other day you got to do the very simple we got to know where we came from what we're doing here and where we're going all right to me that's what the seals are doing even these first force just the first four seals tells me that somebody has come to a place that's brought God on the scene incarnate because at the end of the fourth seal the devil becomes incarnate he's kicked out of heaven amen he's kicked out of heaven and he comes down here it incarnates a human but before that happens God by this eagle anointing has got to incarnate a human humans as telling somebody this morning you said every week talk about the son of man listen to me everybody wake up we talk about the son of man we're in the son of man age we're in the Son of Man age do you really know what you're saying do you really know what you're saying hello son of man hole son of man aren't you guarding human flesh yours then you're part of this on a man ministry amen hey man you and I we're not looking for a son of man to come now we know brother branham was not the Son of man we know that a man he was a son of man so that the son of man could work through him to do what to tell you he was a son of man to tell you he was a son of man no he was proclaiming that you and I are the son of man because what the definition of the Son of Man is God in human flesh that's what you and I are here today because we are God in human flesh we don't believe that one day we will I say we don't we're trying that's why it takes a fivefold ministry remember I told you when I set my definition of fivefold ministry is like a road map and it's folded five times brother Luis if you only unfold it one time oh you'll see a piece of the map but you got four other folds as if you're gonna get wherever you're going you need all of them open all the folds have to be open to see where you came from you know what when you pull your phone out was it what's the first thing you said can I use your location you know what it wants to know where you at if you don't know where you add it can't tell you where you going okay so that's way God's the always cellphone stuff is just what God's already been doing all this GPS and all that stuff God's been using it for for since the since back in eternity he never needed to plug in and go I need to talk to you know it was all Wi-Fi hey man but I look it took to go back down a little bit please mmm mmm the other way the other way whoa whoa that put the brakes on cunning smart with the wisdom of God now we know the wisdom of man got us in trouble but the wisdom of God was already here because you can't discount that Martin Luther you said well Martin Luther was wrong Martin Luther wasn't all wrong Martin Luther was a man of God he was God in human flesh for his time a man but he just didn't have enough word to work with amen brother Brent said one time couldn't get all the way out what we couldn't couldn't get all the people out of the age but I'm telling you on this for sale it's got to show somebody has come out of the age because you can't take a rapture with a denominational idea you cannot do that you because you know why then the rapture is just an event for everybody then it's not a special thing for the bride it's just a if the Baptist's are going then we'll they're just going to go the same time we are Methodists and I'm not saying they won't I'm just telling you the rapture is for born-again Christians dead analyzed born-again Christians the bride remember I told you the other day that there's a difference in in the new birth and eternal life because the foolish virgin are not born again believers they're imparted eternal life sure the new birth is eternal life but the new birth to me is eternal life while you're alive in human flesh walking on the earth in this dimension amen be given eternal life you got to go somewhere else and wait remember even the foolish virgin knowing God knows he's gonna give him eternal life but they've got that compartment they got to stand they got stay dead for a thousand years but we don't know we don't I'm working on a sermon I was working on just back here a few minutes ago just one word we there's two weeds in the Bible one way is weave which are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord the other way is we'll do this and we'll do that I've been looking at in Genesis um you know Laban and then we will do this and we'll do that no it ain't we like that but we which are alive and remain are the what the chosen of God that have accepted and come through all this that we're talking about now we've come through all this and we're standing over here getting ready to take a rapture and we don't know anything you got to know where you come from what you doing here and no but then where are you going now the third beast that went out was the black horse power from God to combat him to combat the power of the black horse was a man cunning smart with the wisdom of God Martin Luther did come under Reformation right because he did restore everything he was a part though of restoration then all right excuse me say ma'am he was a part of restoration Luther Wesley was a part of restoration but they weren't full rent now we got full restoration I will restore what under the Eagle anointing will read brother Bram said only under as an eagle anointing can be we be fully restored amen cuz in the line aids they had the bonus of the line but yet they had to come into the ox which was a beast of burden then they had to come in the man then to the eagle they by all rights a man now a man is the smarter than any of the beasts he's smarter cuz he can outwit him mostly that's why Satan attached herself to that Satan's anointing and he annoys human-beings amen he anoints human beings and you know where he anoints him up that's why I was telling him this morning an anointed one it's not anointed in his soul that's right an anointed one is black in his soul but the Holy Ghost can anoint his spirit it's what brother Brown said in northern ones and make him what signs wonders preach the word Judas Judas was not a born-again believer but yet he had part of the ministry he preached for three and a half years almost with Jesus with signs with wonders so he was anointed on his flesh I don't even mean on his spirit realm amen so he's smarter he can outwit him mostly he's cunning shrewd and the age for the Dark Age now coming out from the Dark Age now where's the Dark Age right here coming from the Dark Age down to this other side where this black horse was riding when they charged for their sacrifices and all the money was just oh you know what it was now the next thing went out to come back to that beast was the face of a man smart educated shrewd fine anointed with that spirit of the day the box brother brown said here's the box they can only do what's inside the box all right anoint it with a spear that day you notice it but I want you to watch if I don't remember and I'm going to tell you now when we get into that our church age though you got to remember when you compartmentalize that we get a throne nobody else's how to throne they've had all this you've got a name it's not knowing you got Jezebel you when you come up to this our age there's a throne there and Jesus says you'll sit with me in my throne alright so we messing with none of this other stuff we got a throne and what is a throne throne means Dominion or power he went to combat him with the cunningness of God's wisdom with him that was the age of the Reformation Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth it was the Reformation Zwingli and well who all knocks Calvin and who all went out it was a cunningness now you watch exactly from the Dark Age from the Reformation this way that way send this way it was the shrewdness of man now somebody got hot if you drop your windows just a little bit that ain't part of the sermon that's not even interpolating he's telling somebody there open the windows hot all right scroll it on up I left that in there just for you laughs but notice it was the shrewdness of man now do you understand pull it up right there but you notice it was a shrewdness of man that do you understand now the third beast that Satan sent out he became shrewd to remember we've talked the whole three months about Satan attaching himself to what God's doing and that's what he is listen he's here today combining what we're doing today I'm not worried about all them back there I'm worried about today he's combating today what we're doing amen but notice it was just rudeness of man now do you understand the third beast that Satan sent out he became through to watch a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny see oh my see the money-making scheme the shrewdness to get the gold of the world and the wealth brought into it now we know that's what's happening in the natural all right what about the spiritual that's exactly the full field that's what began to charge for prayers for a place called purgatory prayed their ancestors out we know all about them in the church in the state was the same member of the church taking your property over and don't you see some of these evangelists these they still have that same anointing on them making old people give up their pensions and deeding their homes over to certain things that's the same anointing you know you know that guy down Louisiana I'm gonna be like him no I'm not you know Jesse Duplantis is his he needs a new jet to get to his believers faster so he needs about 15 million dollars to buy him a new jet to get and if you're on here your false I need a jet to get into my believers and you know what he'll get it that's the sad part why because that spirit of that anointing on the man the man not the inside on the man will get him what he wants so I brother Dale said I can tell you things in my life that I know I was anointed to be a preacher cuz but I used it wrong I can manipulate people you said preacher can't do that yeah we know how to do it don't worry we know how to go with that go down some of you yeah and now I me manipulate bad now I'm talking about we're trying to get you to see what God's trying to tell you now you can use this thing you look when people that come in preach and then they're not born again and they go out what's the first thing they do have an affair first thing it's women money women in popularity those three things will destroy a person if you don't watch out and and even with the Holy Ghost you still got to watch out because you got a spirit realm that's not born again alright so the same will here same with evangelist today they still come anointing on them making old people give up their pensions indeed their homes over to certain things if y'all got good pensions you know want you we need to have that brotherly kindness brotherly kindness I'm gonna read you the Bible remember I wrote I read you that when we went through brotherly kindness well the brown said brotherly kindness was that the first days had all things common why they brought all the money and put it at the feet of the preachers but you know what that was the box for their time it's not now that was the box for their time you know why brother Brown said that though he said so God knew that he needed the funds to fund people to go out and do we don't need that now we got an Internet we got all this other stuff we don't need to fund somebody to go somewhere you know but they did then when they were beginning to go out into these areas and you know you talk about the twelve disciples if you read how they all died they really only one or two died in Giroud the rest of them were like Turkey India Iraq I they were all in different areas when they got killed why because they were sent out to apostle God told him going to law world and preach the gospel they were doing exactly what God told him today and you know what Satan got him alone he killed him same way with me and you nice thing about this other name see he's a separation one if he gets you separate somewhere he can hurt you that's why we need to stay together we need to stay we need to stay as a church and stay as a as a unit amen because Satan loves to pull people to the side and you know you know what I'm done about because he's done you to me the same way now the beasts to combat it was man and we all know that this beast of man this power of man has Intel and intellectuals recognize that that Koecher that Martin Luther see what Martha Luther do God anointed Martin Luther let's adjust y'all live by faith Martin Luther once he run it through his filter told the Catholic Church said that's not the body that's not the blood it is communion he wasn't denying communion he throwed it down and said it's bread and wine it's not the body of Christ cuz it's been exaltedness it what do you put scripture back right amen so you say well Martin Luther was false no he was involved in that his his compartment was what to combat the Catholic Church protest to start the Protestant movement because it's been exalted said his right hand making intercession see wisdom man alright scroll it now let's get to here and we'll read this and a couple more scripture I'm just kind of getting everybody up right back up so we've already been through the first three ages the first one we some about justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost cuz look without the Holy Ghost you're not going in the rapture that's why I said the third seal is very important without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without that oil and wine you're not going in the rapture you might be given eternal life and you gonna have to stand before the white throne judgment because you're not clean you're not clean inside Jesus told me said you're not standing the judgment if you believe in me you have passed judgment you have passed from death unto life amen now the fourth piece now this is one we're coming to and then I'll read the commentary of the in Matthew and then we'll read revelations and then we'll stop and then we'll kind of get started on wincing up now the fourth beast that was sent forth now this is where we're starting now this would come up to now the fourth beast that was sent to combat the Antichrist in this last beast are you ready the last beast that was sent forth or the last power to combat the Antichrist now this is the last beast this is the last person this is the last anointing that the gentle Gentile church is going to get miss it you miss it okay my brother Dale says wake up now that sleepeth all of us shake ourselves man we need to be on the edge of our seat when we see these things that God's already give to it and then set on the edge of our seat for a ballgame and everything else this is the eternal life are the lack of it the last beast that was sent forth or the last power to combat the Antichrist so in other words the Antichrist will be destroyed in this church age hold on a minute temporarily because he's still alive but he'll be destroyed in us he'll have to go away amen who was that who was against the teaching of God the Antichrist was an eagle the last power to combat the Antichrist was an eagle the fourth living beast was an eagle now you just study the ages study the scripture it's an eagle and in the Bible the last age was a Eagle Age and God likens the Eagles to his prophet see now watch the last days egle age a revealer of the true words so we're right here seal number four we're right here thereby all right say man why hey I'm sorry I'm getting pretty tough before God moves to action like he did in the days of Noah he sent forth an eagle when he brought Israel in Pharaoh's army was ready to go he sent an eagle every time he sends an eagle at the last end of it here he sends an eagle again that's exactly with the word so how can you make it anything else he sends an eagle why a revealer of the truth that's been falling all through the age all through the age all those loose ends that's what we're living under we're not living under doubt we shouldn't be living under doubt and fear we should be living under the age that everything is to be made true and known listen this message that we have now it's not part truth Martin Luther's message was part truth John Wesley's message was part truth swingley Calvin all those great ones it was part truth this is all the truth it's all true so how in the world could the the odds or the man or whatever beast was riding how could it ever be revealed unto the Eagles time they had their place they were godly sent because remember the beast is a Holy Ghost power of the Holy Ghost in those ages just the same as anybody else was the line that was the original that's where the Antichrist comes up in combat then he raised up another power he sent a power to meet it then he raised up another pound he sent another power to meet it then at the last power he brings down the Eagle to restore the children back to the original faith again of the fathers the Eagle Age then did you notice there's no more beast that's all of it that's the end the rapture and then now if you take now revelations 10 one through seven I've been referring to it remembering the last messengers age what was to happen all the mysteries of God would be revealed the eagle amen now you see the four that rode that was a perfectly right you believe that and now here's he chained or each power that rode behind it and there's the scripture that shows what the enemy's rider did that's been revealed in these seals and also it's been revealed now that each beast power that God sent out to combat it hits exactly on the dot up to the eagle time all right so what I've been telling you for three months it's the truth people whether I said it or it doesn't matter it's the truth how everything's been set up this chart is not a maybe it's the truth the mother who tells you it's the truth yeah by alright so now let's go to Matthew Matthew 24 verse 9 to 14 we're going to read this and then we'll read revelations because we've been doing that I'm going to read it now and then we'll start on the fourth seal mmm next Sunday I mean no Wednesday night thank you for letting me do any because I was wondering how he's gonna cram all this in here then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted now look this is the fourth seal Jesus is preaching the fourth seal so this is what we get this is specific this is for me and this is us this is the fourth seal in Matthew 24 remember brother Brown said Matthew brother Branham preached two seals in Matthew 24 don't look at me with your mouth open read the cell book it's what he tells us I even wrote him in my when he was doing when he was on tape I could I sit there and underline and put it for sale one single to seal three okay anyways brother Branham said this that this is the fourth seal so watch it being the fourth seal but watch the characteristic of this age right here then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and they shall kill you we're not done yet they may kill some of us we're not done yet and ye shall be hated of All Nations for my namesake and then shall many be offended I'll think about the people in the message and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another I've always said we're gonna our betrayal is going to be from inside Jesus's betrayal was from inside the greatest betrayal that ever was came from inside any betrayal you look at anybody in history the greatest betrayal is somebody that was a friend or something I was inside I've always said that we've got Jesuit priests in there in the message that they're just hid they'll show this I may be one you got to discern that I don't think I'm smart enough to be a Jesuit and then show by telling you that I'm not one and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another look at the hatred even in this message people that hate hate each other and many false prophets shall arise hello and shall deceive many look at all the false doctrine listen I'm telling you one more time if it's a false doctrine it didn't come from God came through the devil but people sit under it we've been given the truth the pure truth and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold now hang on a minute I got my emphatic dag lot it says the love of many will cool where's revelations tell us he said you're neither cold or hot in other words you couldn't you were hot but you're cooling down and I'd rather you just going to be cold but you VIN that's Oh lukewarm water come on people everybody drink lukewarm water yeah Rebecca me too I don't see how in the world boy helm drinks Coca Cola's 150° I just don't see that God takes a special anointing I guess but you see how these when brother Brown said the Bible became a brand new book don't you think that when that prophet of God read these scriptures for years preach sermons for years but when God opened that seal to him it wasn't just that that seal was an antichrist it was that seal had covered things that he had not brother Dale said how many times have you read something I think they've changed the Bible 100 times myself a day cuz you read something you go I didn't read I read the whole book of revelations I didn't read that all right I read class the mystery God revealed and then he brings a quote out or another brother brings a quote out and you go they just take much they just put that in the book I mean really but you know what it is it's in the box you get it when you need it that's why we go over and over and over and over stop me in a minute over and over why cuz it's always been there but you know what we we read over it and it's not our time to get that I just have to see that it's not my time to get that point right there but then somebody else will bring it in the next service or Bluest brother Louisa brother Aaron somebody brother Bob will bring it you go where do you get that from we got it from the Bible because it was written in it but many shall went in the love of many shall wax cold lukewarm but he that shall endure I like this is one of brother Claude best statements he said the only way we're gonna know if we're saved is to do that right there but he that shall endure unto the end we're in the end he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved and this gospel the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come he's telling us the Bible told her Jesus told us in so many words preaching the fourth seal that the rapture was going to take place in the fourth seal but we couldn't read that we couldn't read that until a prophet came told us about the seal told us Jesus had preached it and there he's telling us the end she'll come and then that all right then shall the income revelations 3 this is the anointing to this age now we know it but we're going to read it again and until the Angel the Church of the Laodiceans write these sayings saith the Amen what is Amen so be it but a man is finality when we finish a prayer brother Larry what do we say amen what's the last thing it says in the Bible over in the Book of Revelations what is it 22 or 23 what does it say Amen okay so we're coming to the end these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now who was that who was the beginning of the creation of God God in human flesh Son of Man amen well that baby was born he went born a man and then turned into something he was the son of man he was a God in human flesh at the beginning at the beginning of the creation of God so that's what we get I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot just what he said here in Matthew I would that thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because now since I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing right don't you know don't teach me I know everything don't teach me nothing I don't have to come to church I don't have to listen to you whatever and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched he's telling us what to look for right because what is worse you know if I know I'm naked I can do something about it's like what they say if you got a guy walking down the road and you ain't got to stitch your clothes on and you tell him it stopping telling me naked and he's like I'm fully clothed see the deception that's the deception that Satan has been trying to get each one of us do what he's trying to get us to quit believing he's trying to get his quit believing well we're now fifty-four years since the Prophet come and gone 1965 to 2018 well fifty three years you know I'm hit Wheaton was once another 20 or 30 well Lottie all be dead unless she's 150 Jeanne I'm just sorry that's just the way it is when you get in your seventies and you start talking about another 30 years and that's now that's when you become an unbeliever that's right okay yeah did you say i'ma live another 30 years now I'm will not believe that because of time I'm talking about the Word of God we got to believe what it already says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire gold gold is the most precious thing to me to me what he's telling us I've give you gold I've give you the message of the hour I've give you pure gold and he says I counsel thee to buy of me so we got to go to him to get it amen try it in the fire that means you're not gonna have it easy that thou must be rich now that rich it's different than that other rich and white raiment that thou must be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may see now that see is is understand you know that it's not physically seeing as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock that didn't say if you hear my knock have you noticed that it doesn't say if you hear my knock so in other words he's not just going the knock is his voice every time we come to church we hear let me in because he says right here but hold on stands the door and knocking if any man hear my voice and open the door not to knock the voice and open the door I will come in to him now it's like I told you before if I was the Holy Ghost I have done knock the door down let me and I want to see what's behind that door but God's not that way he said if you hear my voice and open the door volunteer open the door I will come in and we'll stop not just come in what commune will sup with him and here with me to him that overcometh will I grant here we go to sit with me in my throne we see that says in we know that's in not on in my throne what is his throne the throne - son of man that's his throne right that's a Dominion that we're looking at even as I also overcame and I'm sitting down with my father in his throne now we know there's a conversion of Thrones here later on but not now he's telling us you can sit with me and my throne in this endtime not listen we're promised we know for a fact we're going to sit on the throne in the Millennium we know for a fact we're going to sit on the throne at the white throne we know for a fact we're gonna sit on the throne in the new city know for a surety we're gonna sit on the throne before we do all that amen we're gonna sit in that throne now that's what's going to change our body that was what that's what's going to change our body because the son of man got a body change amen so that's what we got in this for still to look forward to let's all stand to look forward to and the fourth seal listen everything happens everything culminates Satan is destroyed your bodies change the resurrection happens the dead in Christ shall rise first we've which are alive and remain sometimes it's funny you know we we sit down we try to get a sermon then we try to get a phrase or or something you know to kind of pick your attention but we we we but we that's a very powerful thing because you know what we what you're alive and remain that puts us in a body change that puts us in the box for the body change that's what I want to be I don't want to be in another age because they're already gone they're already done I want to be in this age I want to be in this box that God promised us listen if he put it in the box it's mine if I open the door and let him in hips up with each one of us you love the Lord this is gonna be good I really the fourth seal is gonna be it's going to be a finality of everything so so you know don't worry about what we know what the fifth seal is them is the souls under the altar and we know that what that is because we've already read it but let's just hang on and let's get this one because the fourth seal we get that for sale we're gonna take a rapture we're gonna get out of here now we know the physical seal you understand the physical seal doesn't open till we leave there by okay with that say ma'am the physical seal because we don't see the man of sin becoming carnot in the pope or whatever you want to call it all right but it's all the events leading up to that time you and I are gonna be here cuz remember brother Branham said when we go up Satan comes down and he incarnates a man then called not an antichrist not a false prophet he has to get back in the beast like he was in the Beast in the beginning hey man let's think amen I think that the sing 161 that they have Redemption 161 the day of redemption is near giveth let's sing it this way the day of redemption is here now when that was written look the anointing the box that that guy was in when he wrote this he said the day of redemption is near because it was coming it ain't coming it's here it's here we've arrived at the place that full Redemption can take place finally finally one day it's going to become a reality - alright let's go VP Haitians are breaking and Israel awakening the signs all days numbered with arrows he turned it a stir [Music] in Chinese minotaurs are failing for me [Music] with a

spirit your redemption is a shoe you know you're the only one who can understand it are you getting what I'm saying you are only the people that can absolutely sit down and map out your journey put it in the Bible put it in the prophets message but you know what that does no good until somebody does it that's a lot til somebody walks on Monday like they walk on Sunday that walks on Tuesday like they walk on Sunday amen that is no good the prophets message there's no good unless it's live the Bible is no good unless it's lived we must live that prophet give his life to preach this message so that you and I can get the truth and not be afraid not have fear if you're afraid somebody's gonna come in from the denominational world and you know God forbid brother Dale have the lapse of memory and let somebody come in a denominational person preach which I don't it doesn't matter if you do and they're gonna deceive you come on I'm afraid now I don't want to listen that preacher on the oh no on the radio I he might he might what tell you something you hadn't already heard come on people that's why I'm saying that it's telling us the church downstairs we don't need to be boastful okay and get the big head because we know who that is that's the devil but we are let's put ourselves in the box we are the chosen people for this age we could have been in any church today now I'm not talk about Luther George I'm talking about the message of the hour we could have been in any church today we could have stayed in the denominational world or we could be out in the world but even standing in the denominational world and you don't get all the truth but we've got all the truth we've got all the truth right here and I'm not saying right here geographically right here I'm saying in this message of the hour with a fivefold ministry we have a message that'll change our body no one else had that opportunity no one they didn't even listen the chosen of God didn't even understand when he had a body change are you gonna restore the kingdom are you coming back who you stand with us you leaving really Peters went fishing is that Jesus well he's dead the two from a mass how would you like to walk with a man had been raised from the dead got a glorified body and it was Jesus that they had followed before and then he walks with him they said for the better part of a day and they didn't know him to what they even in time he did something to prove who he was in the evening time when they went in the door of the house he did something like he had done when he was here he meant in the evening time it's when it was revealed who he was amen and then you know what they went told everybody and guess what nobody probably believed them they're not gonna believe that you and I are gonna take a body change you listen I'm in God's box I'm in the box I need to be in and that box will take me to a body change if I stay in the box amen that's a problem we want to get over in someone else's box no I'm staying this box right here this box and what's the ezreal doing really doesn't matter what Israel do it sure watch them but listen anything that happens in this whole world political religious even demonic power we'll get into it the fourth seal because it's the pale horse but it all depends on what me and you do it's a reaction to an action the action is coming from us
