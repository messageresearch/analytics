[2:59] Laurie Amen god bless you tonight I
[3:05] don't think I'm gonna sing tonight makes
[3:08] thing later could be in the house the
[3:11] Lord the nut
[3:14] y'all just pray for me and I don't know
[3:21] what it is you start praying and you
[3:29] start trying to you know find the mind
[3:33] of the Lord trying to find something to
[3:36] say don't just get up here but don't you
[3:42] see seems like you just get I just can't
[3:45] get any sleep you just get tired or and
[3:47] tired or so I feel like I I could lay
[3:50] down sleep right now
[3:51] so you man y'all just pray for me to not
[3:55] and you know they say you know I guess
[3:59] the devil's trying to work on this so
[4:01] the Lord must have something for us so
[4:05] we're just gonna look into the scripture
[4:07] to not hoping to be a blessing to you
[4:09] we're gonna first we're gonna go to
[4:10] Romans chapter 6 and then we're gonna
[4:13] and then we just got one verse in
[4:16] Galatians so we'll speak tonight on
[4:23] manifestation not impersonation and you
[4:28] know it's in the hour in which we live
[4:33] it's it's quite interesting that you
[4:35] know we have a lot of people that they
[4:39] like to use the word identify I identify
[4:43] with this identify with that the problem
[4:47] is when they say identify you know
[4:51] they're not in any way connected to that
[4:54] and you know you know after the world
[4:59] you know we've had people that you know
[5:03] belong to different want to be different
[5:06] races and you know different groups and
[5:10] all kinds of stuff you know that they
[5:11] say hey I want to be you know I
[5:13] in a file with this well you know
[5:15] brother Brennan preached a message
[5:17] called impersonation of Christianity and
[5:21] you know people want to identify with
[5:23] something but what is the standard that
[5:25] you have to meet right to be that and
[5:29] there's only one foundation that God
[5:31] ever give us to build on there's that
[5:34] one standard that's the word right and
[5:37] so now you know we're kind of where I
[5:39] want to go tonight but I don't know how
[5:41] long I'm gonna speak tonight but I just
[5:42] it's just what Lord laid on my heart and
[5:45] I just want to share this with you and
[5:47] hope it'll be a blessing
[5:48] so let's before we get started let's
[5:50] just pray and then we'll get right into
[5:52] the scripture our gracious Heavenly
[5:55] Father Lord Jesus we love you and we
[5:57] just thank you for all that you've done
[5:58] for us and we just pray tonight you just
[6:00] come and speak through lips of clay Lord
[6:03] tonight and just be with us in a special
[6:05] way and father for each need that's
[6:08] represented in this building tonight
[6:09] lord I just pray that you'll be with
[6:11] them and minister in a special way for
[6:13] all that are a Sikh and whatever that
[6:15] whatever the needs are Lord you know it
[6:18] and we know that you I have already made
[6:20] a way and already made it and it's
[6:24] already been finished before the
[6:25] foundation of the world and Lord we're
[6:27] just so thankful that that father we
[6:29] just pray that you just come and help us
[6:31] tonight and bless each one that's here
[6:32] bless the bride around the world Lord
[6:34] for the ones that are working and
[6:36] laboring and your vineyard we just pray
[6:39] that you continue to bless them give
[6:41] them strength and Lord we just pray just
[6:44] commit all things to you tonight in the
[6:47] name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Romans
[6:52] chapter 6 is very familiar baptismal
[6:54] scripture says what shall we say then
[6:58] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[7:01] abound god forbid
[7:03] how shall we that are dead to sin live
[7:07] longer how shall we that are dead to sin
[7:12] live any longer therein know ye not that
[7:14] so many of us that were baptized into
[7:17] Christ Jesus were baptized into his
[7:20] death therefore we are buried with him
[7:23] by baptism into death that like as
[7:26] Christ
[7:27] was raised up from the dead by the glory
[7:28] of the Father even so we also should
[7:31] walk in the newness of life for if we
[7:34] have been planted together in the
[7:36] likeness of his death we shall also in
[7:38] the likeness of his resurrection knowing
[7:40] this that our old man is crucified with
[7:43] him that the body of sin might be
[7:45] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[7:47] serve sin for he that is dead is freed
[7:50] from sin for if we be dead with Christ
[7:54] we believe that we shall also live with
[7:56] him knowing that Christ being raised
[7:59] from the dead death no more death have
[8:02] no more dominion over him for in that he
[8:06] died he died unto sin once but in that
[8:10] he liveth he liveth unto God likewise
[8:13] reckon you also yourselves to be dead
[8:15] indeed unto sin but live unto God
[8:18] through Jesus Christ our Lord amen and
[8:21] the next scripture will reach just one
[8:23] scripture here in Galatians two it says
[8:25] I am crucified with Christ and that's
[8:29] what struck me people want to identify
[8:31] with something but Paul says I am
[8:34] crucified I don't run just to identify
[8:35] with Christ he said I'm crucified I went
[8:37] the same path that that that Jesus took
[8:41] I've been the same way nevertheless I
[8:46] live yet not i but Christ liveth in me
[8:55] because there's been a conversion right
[8:58] so when the old man is dead he said I'm
[9:00] still living in the same flesh but the
[9:03] life I live is not the old man right and
[9:08] the life which I now live in the flesh I
[9:12] live by the faith of the Son of God who
[9:15] loved me and gave himself for me
[9:18] amen god bless you tonight you may be
[9:20] seated I didn't think I was the
[9:26] waterworks let's start
[9:32] praise the Lord amen
[9:36] we're like thank the Lord for the
[9:38] reading of the word
[9:39] thank you for there's the scripture here
[9:43] and that we read in Romans 6 and in
[9:48] verse 3 it says know you not that so
[9:50] many of us as were baptized into Christ
[9:53] Jesus were baptized into his death
[9:56] now when you when you and I didn't go
[9:59] back and pull up the the Greek and all
[10:03] of that but when you go back and look at
[10:05] what this what the verses mean when he's
[10:09] speaking of baptism the baptizing is not
[10:11] just being immersed in water but it also
[10:15] speaks of the unity and the fellowship
[10:18] that you have with Jesus Christ has been
[10:20] coming into something and I think I
[10:24] can't remember who was my brother Wade
[10:26] or somebody was was talking about using
[10:29] the word baptism and the word baptism
[10:31] was speaking of the illustration that
[10:35] was given was about pickles about taking
[10:39] cucumbers you know you bul the you put
[10:41] them in bowl and put the cucumber into
[10:43] boiling water and that's just an outward
[10:45] that's the first stage I was they said
[10:48] that you know it's temporary but the
[10:50] second stage is going into the vinegar
[10:52] solution which actually produces the
[10:55] change so it's not just doing the
[10:58] outward works but it's actually going
[11:01] through the process and having a change
[11:04] take place and so he talks about the
[11:07] unity that not never because it you know
[11:11] I believe that the commission that was
[11:14] given was repent and be baptized so I
[11:19] believe that is a necessary element of
[11:22] it is to be baptized is to be immersed
[11:25] in water but that's not the end of it
[11:28] because if we repent and we are baptized
[11:31] and we believe then God's obligated to
[11:35] do his part which is to give us the Holy
[11:37] Ghost
[11:39] so he says that we are to be so we are
[11:43] to follow him and go through the steps
[11:46] that he ordered for us to do and then in
[11:53] Galatians 2 when it says I am crucified
[11:55] with Christ so that shows that he says
[12:00] through Christ's death on the cross that
[12:03] he was crucified it says the way they
[12:08] were said it has utterly destroyed our
[12:12] former self it's not just separated but
[12:17] it's actually destroyed and then it says
[12:20] completely separated from the corruption
[12:23] of the old creature so all of that has
[12:26] been destroyed and been totally
[12:28] separated and annihilated and moved away
[12:30] so that we no longer live in the old way
[12:36] because it's Paul said the life I live
[12:40] is not me but it's Christ and so you
[12:47] know we I mean people that want to not
[12:52] just you know identify with something
[12:55] but it's to be crucified it's to die up
[12:57] to ourselves and and you you look at in
[13:01] the scripture and and you the word
[13:06] identify is not in the in the scripture
[13:09] but taking the fault and you look up the
[13:13] word identified because you know people
[13:16] today they say we only be identified
[13:17] with something and brother Branham
[13:19] preached a message identified with
[13:21] Christ and you know you take that zone
[13:25] what what does it mean to be identified
[13:27] or identify what is it what's the word
[13:29] meaning and there's two different ways
[13:31] of looking at the word identify the
[13:34] first one means to establish who or what
[13:38] something is so you clearly make
[13:42] something known they says to make clear
[13:46] or show plainly so that's to identify
[13:51] and so another way of looking at that is
[13:56] to manifest what that is to identify
[14:00] that is to make manifesto to reveal
[14:02] something so that is how it is and as he
[14:06] will say use me as Paul was saying
[14:09] that's not me anymore but it's Christ
[14:10] that liveth so it's Christ being made
[14:13] manifest I'm revealing Christ Christ has
[14:17] become real in my life so that's what
[14:18] comes out it's not that I have to try to
[14:22] do something to make him visible it
[14:25] becomes visible because of the life
[14:30] that's in there and the second one that
[14:34] we look at is another version of the
[14:38] word identify is to associate with to
[14:46] associate closely to relate with to side
[14:50] with but no matter how close you try to
[14:54] relate some thinner or try to be close
[14:57] to or side with you can never be what
[15:01] that is people you know I side with this
[15:05] you know but that is you know is really
[15:08] the other definition for the word is
[15:10] impersonate because no matter how close
[15:13] you get you're still just an
[15:15] impersonation of that you because it's
[15:18] not real you know even if you take
[15:20] something that's a replica it can be a
[15:23] masterpiece as far as a replica of a
[15:27] statue or a sculpture or a painting but
[15:30] it's still it's still I mean there still
[15:33] it's not real it still has the part of
[15:37] being counterfeit because no matter how
[15:41] much you try to make of it it's still
[15:43] not the exact same thing so it's it's
[15:47] not what it is so we can't we can have a
[15:51] part of something but it's not real and
[15:55] you know we can we can identify things
[15:58] by you know sight and sound and one of
[16:02] the things I was thinking about when I
[16:03] was what I was looking at this was
[16:05] though about brother Gary Adkinson you
[16:08] know brother Gary I think was one of the
[16:09] top people in the world make people
[16:11] laugh and impersonate people you know he
[16:15] could start talking about like somebody
[16:17] and you'd think it was them
[16:19] you know hick it they could get that
[16:21] really down really close but you know
[16:24] that didn't identify I mean it you could
[16:26] tell who he was what he was trying to
[16:28] impersonate but that wasn't the person
[16:31] but you know you can try to do so much
[16:34] but if you but if it's not real
[16:36] you can try to live the life of a
[16:38] Christian but but that's not real
[16:40] brother Brown said just be who you are
[16:44] we're not we're not trying to try to do
[16:48] you know I'm trying to make something
[16:50] happen we just need to be and let him
[16:54] live this is from the from the message
[16:59] identified with Christ 1959 he said
[17:05] would just seem to see there's no
[17:08] satisfaction among the people what do
[17:10] they what makes them do it it's for a
[17:13] cause it's a nature God gave them that
[17:15] nature they've got a nature that makes
[17:17] them want to have something to identify
[17:20] themselves with they must have something
[17:23] that they want to be like an object
[17:26] objective in life they want to be a
[17:29] movie star a cowboy or something on that
[17:31] idea he said I was hearing on the radio
[17:33] coming home where some great Italian men
[17:36] at Denver was trying to play Hopalong
[17:38] Krass that he's something with a loaded
[17:40] gun instead of that he's going to be a
[17:42] Chester the rest of his life he shot his
[17:45] kneecap off there you are and some
[17:48] people probably don't know who Chester
[17:50] is I was like we'll find out who people
[17:54] who the older folks are people ever
[17:58] watch Gunsmoke but it says but they are
[18:01] trying to find something to identify
[18:04] themselves with and the reason they are
[18:06] doing it is because there's something in
[18:09] them that God made them that but God
[18:12] made them an exam God made them an
[18:14] example to be identified with and that
[18:17] was when he made Jesus Christ become
[18:19] I become your Savior that's the example
[18:22] that's what people want should want to
[18:25] be identified with Jesus to be like him
[18:27] and they continue continues on and he's
[18:32] talking about the kids wanting to be
[18:34] like different ones and he says you know
[18:40] the the kids wanting to be different
[18:42] ones but he said the example was Jesus
[18:44] Christ he said God gave us an example to
[18:47] be like but we refuse to be it now
[18:50] that's what the matter with the world
[18:51] they got the desire God has given that
[18:54] but they've turned it the wrong way it's
[18:58] time to return back and get on the right
[18:59] Road and get facing Calvary nature
[19:03] proves you know though and you know the
[19:09] world is full of of people that as
[19:13] brother brother dick was just saying it
[19:16] just a min ago you know the world is
[19:21] full and I didn't I didn't bring the
[19:23] pictures but if you if you have the
[19:25] desire to see it I'll show you them I'll
[19:28] show you the pictures but these are some
[19:30] of the people that live in the world and
[19:32] I'm gonna tell you about a few and you
[19:36] know and some moment some of them were
[19:38] pretty familiar with because we've heard
[19:41] all about it and you know I mean we've
[19:43] got an even brother Bentham I've got a
[19:46] quote in here where you know he talks
[19:48] about the world being full of perversion
[19:49] he says the girls want to be like look
[19:51] you know trying to be boys and the boys
[19:52] are trying to be like girls and and all
[19:55] of that and I said well you know what
[19:56] because we see that that's a big part of
[19:58] the world we've got a bunch of people
[20:01] that are trying to be like one person
[20:02] and and somebody else is trying to be
[20:04] like somebody else and you know men
[20:05] trying to be like women and women trying
[20:07] to be like me and and we've got white
[20:09] people identifying with black people and
[20:11] you know I don't know if y'all heard
[20:13] about the the college professor who
[20:16] called african-american studies and
[20:19] identified with as a black person was
[20:21] even hired as a black person and worked
[20:24] in again a verse city and both her
[20:26] parents are as white as I am
[20:29] but she identified and they hired her as
[20:32] a black woman because she identified as
[20:35] being black and their and and so we have
[20:40] those kind of people know that the ones
[20:42] that the ones that I think are most
[20:44] astonishing I guess is the best word to
[20:46] say is the people who think they're
[20:48] animals now I didn't bring the pictures
[20:51] but if you want to see them I'll show
[20:53] them - we can pull them up but there are
[20:55] people online who live as dogs they live
[21:00] in these leather suits and they had a
[21:03] picture of a man who looks like a Great
[21:05] Dane and he's sitting on the couch with
[21:07] his master owner he eats out of out of a
[21:12] bowl he does everything like a dog there
[21:16] is oh there is a woman in Norway and you
[21:19] look it up there's a woman in Norway who
[21:21] believes she's a cat she believes she
[21:24] can see better at night
[21:26] she hates water she hates dogs but
[21:30] everything that you associate with a cat
[21:32] that's her life she said at the age of
[21:36] 16 she realized that she was a cat and
[21:41] you know these people will tell you that
[21:46] you don't get no matter what you say
[21:48] that is their reality then and they
[21:53] don't care what you say to them that is
[21:55] what is real to them now what's so funny
[21:59] is we got a lot of people in the world
[22:01] today and you ask them how they're doing
[22:03] you know and in the urban in the urban
[22:06] language in the slang because we as we
[22:08] say you people you ask people how they
[22:09] do it say I'm keeping it real I'm
[22:12] keeping it real
[22:15] well you know what it ain't keepin it
[22:17] real it's keeping it true it's the truth
[22:23] no one because we can lock in our own
[22:25] reality but is it the truth
[22:30] Jonah's reality was laying in the belly
[22:33] of the whale wrapped in seaweed but the
[22:37] truth was he was on the journey where
[22:39] God he was in the right place where God
[22:41] wanted him that he was on the way to
[22:45] deliver Nineveh but that's what but his
[22:47] reality was down learning as brother
[22:49] Brent said in the vomit and all the
[22:51] other things that he was down and he
[22:52] thought he was so miserable that was his
[22:55] reality the Hebrew children their
[22:58] reality was in a flame of fire that was
[23:02] so hard that the men that tried to put
[23:04] them in died that was the reality that
[23:07] they were in the truth was they were
[23:11] right there where God wanted them to be
[23:13] and they were in them in the hands of
[23:15] God that their because they were so they
[23:17] were so in tune with God and standing on
[23:20] his word that he become visible to them
[23:23] in the flames you know because sometimes
[23:28] what is our reality but the truth is
[23:31] sometimes we don't realize that we're
[23:32] right in the hands of God you know you
[23:34] know we're weird we're in better hands
[23:37] than Allstate as this you know we're you
[23:39] know good hands that also you know I'd
[23:40] rather be in God's hands see that is the
[23:46] reality we can have a you know we can
[23:51] have a reality what we think is real
[23:53] what we see but because we live in a
[23:56] world of senses but are we in the truth
[24:01] jesus said i am the way the truth and
[24:04] the life
[24:05] a philippians tells us that paul said he
[24:10] said whatsoever things are true
[24:11] whatsoever things are just you know all
[24:17] the different whatsoever things are
[24:19] lovely whatsoever things are pure
[24:20] whatsoever things are a good report he
[24:23] said he said if there be any virtue of
[24:25] there be any praise and think Oh
[24:26] these things not thinking a reality but
[24:35] you know we have so many people that you
[24:36] know they want to live in a you know
[24:38] they've got their own way of living now
[24:43] the another craziest one I'm going to
[24:48] tell you about some of the way that some
[24:50] of these people live in the world there
[24:53] was a man who went through the process
[24:57] to become a woman and now he's in the
[25:01] process or she whatever whichever
[25:04] pronoun you think but this person is now
[25:09] trying to become a dragon it's it's
[25:14] tattooed from head to toe has had their
[25:17] ears surgically removed and has horns
[25:20] and has died the the eye white of this
[25:26] person's eyes are now green and that you
[25:33] can't convince them otherwise that's
[25:36] what they are they live in that reality
[25:42] there was a there was a woman who went
[25:47] through all of the procedures surgeries
[25:53] everything you can think of to become a
[25:56] woman and she will tell you that if you
[26:02] think she's still a man even though she
[26:05] said well after I've spent all this time
[26:07] surgery everything I've done to become
[26:10] this and you tell me that I'm not said
[26:13] you're the one that's crazy you're the
[26:17] one that has a problem but you know what
[26:21] no matter what you do you can never ever
[26:24] ever change the DNA that DNA will always
[26:29] stay the same no matter what and it's
[26:33] just like and and a few other few other
[26:37] ones and some of the oddball ones we've
[26:39] had a few other people
[26:40] we had a man that tried to beat you no
[26:42] claim to be a surgeon done surgeries
[26:45] good actually operated impersonated a
[26:48] surgeon then three surgeries and the and
[26:50] the doctors were actually amazed at this
[26:52] man's medical technique he completed
[26:57] three surgeries and they were amazed but
[26:59] they finally arrested him for
[27:00] impersonating and practicing without a
[27:02] license it doesn't care what how much
[27:07] this man could do he still wasn't a
[27:09] doctor we have people that walk up and
[27:13] down the streets you find different
[27:15] people they employ impersonate police
[27:16] officers they impersonate soldiers and
[27:18] all kinds of other things they live in a
[27:20] reality that's not yours but it's real
[27:23] to them I worked with a guy years ago he
[27:29] was telling me a story
[27:29] he said he got drunk he was trying to
[27:32] make it home going down the hall he was
[27:34] going down the sidewalk he said I got to
[27:36] a certain point and he said then the
[27:37] sidewalk disappeared he said I was
[27:39] staying there trying to figure out well
[27:40] the decided what he said cause it was
[27:42] there and then it what and he stood
[27:45] there trying to figure out where the
[27:45] sidewalk was you couldn't convince him
[27:48] the sidewalk guess it did disappear he
[27:53] had to have some help from some folks to
[27:54] get him home and they did get him home
[27:56] but you know what that was his reality
[28:00] but what's what's the craziest thing is
[28:03] now what we talk about all these people
[28:05] that are you know mind-boggling but
[28:11] what's what's crazier than that to me is
[28:13] the people that claim to be a Christian
[28:16] we have we have a world full of people
[28:18] that claim to be Christians and and it's
[28:23] like well what what is it what is to
[28:25] mean to be a Christian what is it what
[28:28] is it how do we identify a Christian
[28:32] well I just say so I hung up a cross
[28:36] just like people you know how do you how
[28:39] do you claim you know identify message
[28:41] believer well I got my equal belt buckle
[28:43] how is it how is it that we identify
[28:46] these things because people people want
[28:51] to talk about you know I
[28:53] I want to be I'm identified with Christ
[28:56] I'm a Christian but what does it mean to
[28:59] be a Christian we go back to the message
[29:09] identify with Christ brother Bram says
[29:11] now if people of this day with that
[29:14] great desire and great ambitions to be
[29:16] like somebody for an example he said if
[29:19] they took Christ as their example he
[29:22] said then we could fire every police
[29:25] there was in the nation everybody would
[29:28] be meek and humble everybody would be
[29:30] kind and have brotherly love one for the
[29:32] other there would never be a divorce
[29:34] case ever played in our country there
[29:38] would never be any sickness
[29:39] we could even dismiss hospitals if
[29:42] everybody tried to make Jesus Christ
[29:44] their example he said we wouldn't have
[29:46] need for nothing else and then dropped
[29:57] down he says but oh I'll be thankful all
[30:00] through eternity too one day I read
[30:03] about Jesus that satisfied me I want to
[30:06] be like him
[30:07] that's my desire to be able to turn the
[30:10] other cheek or to go the second mile to
[30:13] be able to forgive when the odds is all
[30:16] against you hold nothing against anybody
[30:20] though they're mistreating you
[30:22] rightfully or wrongfully for your right
[30:25] doing but still love them that's the way
[30:29] I want to be I tell you what some
[30:34] sometimes things happen and you read
[30:37] something like that anything or that you
[30:39] know that's hard yeah you know I think
[30:43] about David's sometimes when you know
[30:47] when David respected the anointing that
[30:51] was on soul and God puts all and David's
[30:57] hands and even though Saul had turned
[31:02] his back on God and
[31:06] he said but I wouldn't I would dare
[31:08] touch God's anointed and the three times
[31:12] that David was David had the opportunity
[31:15] to kill Saul
[31:16] even though you look at how many times
[31:19] it's all try to kill David and then he
[31:23] turned around and even David's own men
[31:25] told him Sid said look God has put him
[31:29] in your hand and he went down there he
[31:34] took his sword and it said he cut off
[31:36] part of Saul's skirt and then he left
[31:41] and you know the scripture tells us that
[31:43] that it even it even bothered David
[31:46] enough that just because he cut off
[31:48] Saul's skirt that is that he destroyed
[31:52] his garment and then even called out to
[31:55] him and told him said listen you know
[31:58] God I could have killed you
[32:00] God made this way that I could have
[32:03] killed you but I did and he held up that
[32:06] part of that skirt and said look I could
[32:09] have killed you and I didn't he showed
[32:12] the integrity that David had in his
[32:15] heart he says that's the way I want to
[32:19] be I want to be that kind of a person I
[32:21] want to be able that when I'm real de
[32:24] pon i would not rail back that's the
[32:27] kind of example that God gave us in
[32:28] Jesus Christ we ought to be identified
[32:31] with him said how do we become
[32:33] identified with him brother you'd say
[32:35] brother branham now you have to dress
[32:37] like Hollywood stars and do these things
[32:40] but how do you become identified with
[32:42] Jesus Christ first you repent of what
[32:45] you already have done and then you're
[32:49] identified with him here in the pool no
[32:52] doubt what many will be identified with
[32:54] him in a few minutes and in the pool you
[32:56] are identified with him in baptism for
[32:59] if we baptize our baptized in Christ we
[33:01] are identified to his death burial and
[33:04] resurrection that's why we were baptized
[33:05] we go down in the water and come back up
[33:08] to witness that we believe in the death
[33:10] burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ
[33:12] and if we be planted in his likeness in
[33:15] his death God gave us a promise we'd be
[33:18] like him in
[33:19] the resurrection we want to be just just
[33:25] like him
[33:26] but it's not it's not to be
[33:29] impersonation of him but we wanted to
[33:31] have the same life that he has we want
[33:33] him living in us you know many people
[33:36] they they talk about wanting to live and
[33:39] it's like well how do you come up how do
[33:43] you identify yourself with Christ how do
[33:46] you identify yourself and you know many
[33:49] people that they they want to look and
[33:52] the reality is is the truth is rather is
[33:56] they live in the reality of Jesus it's
[34:00] their reality yeah some people get up
[34:03] and they say well Jesus was a social
[34:05] reformer he come to change the world he
[34:10] said he said I didn't he said this is
[34:12] not my kingdom he said he said if this
[34:15] was mocking if we come to fight flesh he
[34:18] said my people would rise up and fight
[34:20] but we didn't he said he said the Son of
[34:23] man didn't come to do anything but to
[34:25] seek and save those were lost that's all
[34:27] his goal was but many people want to
[34:30] identify Jesus they want to make him a
[34:32] certain pedestal many people they say
[34:37] Jesus was all loving Jesus Jesus was a
[34:41] good God he was he was loving and he was
[34:45] compassionate but do you know what
[34:49] compassionate means see two big
[34:54] compassion that doesn't mean that you
[34:55] just hand everything over to somebody
[35:01] there was a there was a man that was in
[35:04] in Vietnam in the in the war and he said
[35:09] we got all these excuse me you know you
[35:11] have these young men usually go to
[35:15] college or sometimes they go through
[35:17] what they call OCS Officer Candidate
[35:19] School they become an officer they get
[35:22] their little gold bar put them on their
[35:24] shoulders you know and then they say hey
[35:25] do you know this man you know he's still
[35:27] wet behind the ears but he's gonna lead
[35:29] this group
[35:31] well you know what they do they sent him
[35:33] over there and the first thing they do
[35:34] is they find some hard crusty sergeant
[35:37] and he goes out this man who knows what
[35:40] he's doing and he put this young man
[35:42] with him and until he actually gets to
[35:44] the place where they think he they can
[35:46] turn him over and actually lead a group
[35:48] had to stay with the sergeant they knew
[35:51] what was going on but you know he was
[35:54] telling about they had all these people
[35:55] and and they come over there and he said
[35:58] they want to they wanted to be their
[36:01] friend they wanted to be their buddies
[36:04] and and you know he said he said a lot
[36:07] of these officers that were young men
[36:09] that got to this place he said they were
[36:13] killing them with kindness he said he
[36:17] said that wasn't that didn't help them
[36:19] any he said the ones that were actually
[36:23] helped them were the ones that actually
[36:25] made him follow the rules he said you
[36:28] know he said the one thing he hated was
[36:30] a few walking long distances and going
[36:32] through all these things this he said
[36:34] the one thing you took care of was your
[36:35] feet that's the way you got around and
[36:39] he said he said he said they had to go
[36:41] change their socks and wash their feet
[36:42] and take care of their boots and all
[36:44] these type things he said was sometimes
[36:46] a lot of them was after they went
[36:48] through a hard day and threw about or
[36:50] whatever the lieutenant would just say
[36:52] we just lay down but he said he said the
[36:57] ones that actually cared about the
[36:59] people about his men it's the first
[37:01] thing done when they sat down is change
[37:03] your socks have you checked your feet
[37:05] what's going on and do you have any
[37:06] leeches on them are you taking care of
[37:08] these things see being compassionate is
[37:11] not just enabling somebody to do
[37:13] something but actually holding them to
[37:15] the standard that is being compassionate
[37:19] and people say with Jesus was
[37:20] compassionate yes he was but he still
[37:23] made them hold the standard people say
[37:27] today oh don't judge me don't judge me
[37:29] you don't have the right to judge me no
[37:35] but the word is our judge what are we
[37:40] standing well you know what are we as
[37:42] Christians we mean what are we looking
[37:44] at
[37:45] I mean is it just a reality are we
[37:47] actually staying with the word I mean do
[37:50] we actually hold this standard into
[37:55] people say well don't judge me you know
[37:57] you don't have a right and you know and
[38:02] I've heard I've heard this more than
[38:03] once people talk about Jesus they said
[38:07] well you know that woman that they found
[38:09] in adultery and they brought her to
[38:11] Jesus and they threw her down and they
[38:12] said the law says we must stone her and
[38:18] say you know Jesus didn't stone her but
[38:24] you know Jesus got down and he wrote in
[38:28] the sand and when she didn't have any
[38:31] more accusers he asked her said woman
[38:33] where are your accusers so Lord I don't
[38:36] have any their bone and it's like oh but
[38:41] jesus said when neither do i condemn
[38:42] thee that's what that's the part that
[38:47] people don't realize he said neither do
[38:50] i condemn thee well you know what Jesus
[38:53] didn't send her back out to be a
[38:54] prostitute he come up and said neither
[38:58] do i condemn thee but go and sin no more
[39:03] God Jesus didn't coming enable her just
[39:06] Oh we'll go ahead just do what you know
[39:08] I run off all your accusers go ahead and
[39:10] do it again no he was compassionate but
[39:17] he still held her to the word and he
[39:19] told her go and sin no more and so
[39:22] that's the way it is it's doing it do we
[39:24] hold ourselves or hold them to the word
[39:26] is there a standard brother branham was
[39:30] speaking one time he was talking about
[39:32] speaking to a and it was the Catholic
[39:34] Reporter and you know was talking about
[39:36] the different miracles that had taken
[39:38] place I believe was a the man that
[39:41] brother and opened the blind man's eyes
[39:43] and he was in Mexico or something or
[39:45] something along those lines but you know
[39:47] he was talking to the reporter and she
[39:49] was Catholic and you know and and she
[39:53] was talking about what do you believe
[39:54] our saints can do these things and all
[39:56] these different things and you know
[39:57] brother Branham says
[39:58] well you know it's the word he's oh well
[40:01] you can't you can't judge it by the word
[40:03] we judge it by the church well if you
[40:07] can't hold if you don't have a standard
[40:08] like where the Rebbe said if you don't
[40:09] have a standard then how do you come to
[40:11] a place to agree or even speak from
[40:14] because if you don't believe the word
[40:15] and I do then there's no place to start
[40:17] from
[40:18] and so you have to come to a place and
[40:22] then when you try to show people this is
[40:24] what the word says well nowadays we
[40:28] don't know you know well nowadays this
[40:29] will just get us a new Bible we've got a
[40:32] new translation whatever is that you
[40:35] don't like we just take it out of the
[40:36] Bible
[40:37] I think somebody here was talking about
[40:41] I don't remember who was some I think
[40:43] somebody with somebody you know they had
[40:44] that the book now called the Queen James
[40:47] by Bobbie if you don't know what that is
[40:53] yeah Sodom and Gomorrha and perversion
[40:56] is not in the scripture anymore they
[40:58] took it all out so if you if you want to
[41:01] live like that then it's okay because
[41:02] the Bible doesn't condemn it and then
[41:06] you have versions like the NIV where you
[41:08] start talking about where the scripture
[41:10] talks about Jesus came to seek and save
[41:13] those who are lost and different other
[41:15] scriptures that talk about salvation you
[41:17] can't even find them in the book it's
[41:22] like you go to the King James and you
[41:24] start reading and you go to the NIV it's
[41:26] not there
[41:28] it's like well we just we just find our
[41:30] own version of the Bible we get a new
[41:32] translation or whatever and we can we
[41:35] can live however what because this is
[41:36] our Bible well this is my reality just
[41:43] like just like they were talking about
[41:45] the the woman that got sick and her son
[41:48] had went to went to school and brother
[41:50] I'm telling the story about him going
[41:52] off to off to school to study and you
[41:55] know she got sick and they said the
[41:57] people from the mission down and the
[41:59] little preacher come down and read the
[42:01] scripture to and anointed her and prayed
[42:03] over and she got healed and then when
[42:05] her son came to find out what had
[42:07] happened to her because you know she was
[42:08] on her deathbed and he come home as like
[42:11] what took place my
[42:12] it's like well you know they took the
[42:14] scripture and they read it and and then
[42:16] they prayed over me March 16 and they
[42:18] read the scripture and they pray I know
[42:20] I did Mia prayed over me and you know
[42:21] what I got matter and he's like oh mama
[42:25] mama now hold on
[42:27] that's not even inspired I saw second
[42:32] him that's not even that's not even
[42:36] worth it we don't even read that you
[42:39] know that she got excited it's like well
[42:40] you know if the Lord can use it because
[42:42] that's not inspired well if he can do
[42:44] that with uninspired Word what can he do
[42:45] with the inspired Word what can he do
[42:51] with what was really inspired because we
[42:57] have to we have to find a resting place
[43:04] a place a standard because you know a
[43:08] lot of people you know is is Jesus
[43:11] because when we speak you know people
[43:15] people know about being a Christian well
[43:18] you know what does that what does that
[43:19] mean is are we looking at a Living God
[43:22] or are we looking at a historical figure
[43:29] you know I mean when we speak of Jesus
[43:33] and being identified with people talk
[43:36] about being identified with Christ I
[43:37] mean are we looking at you know we're
[43:39] using a Bible you know we're looking at
[43:41] the Bible or we're using a history book
[43:46] because you know today it's become big
[43:51] business and and you know to revise
[43:54] history and I think the quote was me
[43:59] many years ago was you know the victors
[44:02] always are the ones that write history
[44:04] and so they always write the history
[44:07] they want it to be but you know the Jews
[44:10] history that talks about in the Old
[44:12] Testament you know there's a lot of
[44:14] things that were said about a lot of
[44:15] those people in there that you know if
[44:17] they had been writing their history they
[44:19] would have never put it in there I mean
[44:23] that's a lot of things about Abraham's
[44:24] life
[44:25] you know Abraham didn't want it you
[44:27] probably wouldn't want anybody to know
[44:28] and there's a lot of people things that
[44:30] people haven't you know they didn't want
[44:32] anybody to know but you know in the end
[44:37] it shows the grace of God
[44:39] it shows the grace of God in our lives
[44:41] and their lives because he's the same
[44:45] yesterday today and forever and what he
[44:47] done for them he'll do for us today also
[44:52] know this is from the message letting
[44:57] off letting off the pressure 1963
[45:01] brother Graham says that's the way of a
[45:02] Christian experience when people are
[45:04] trying to put a cold formal confession
[45:07] into a powerful Pentecostal church or
[45:09] experience unless that person is built
[45:12] up is built from ground up built up born
[45:15] again regenerated impersonators of today
[45:17] going around trying to impersonate
[45:19] speaking in tongues trying to
[45:21] impersonate this and personate that the
[45:23] gifts if they are not born again he said
[45:25] and if they are born again they cannot
[45:27] impersonate because they are built for
[45:29] these things they're born regenerated
[45:31] remoted not just something that's
[45:33] patched up and shook hands and got
[45:35] emotion and danced around the altar a
[45:37] few times it says I got it it's
[45:39] something that's been remoted and
[45:41] regenerated and become a new creature
[45:43] then it can stand the pressure of the
[45:46] persecution and the things that follows
[45:48] the spiritual life you've got to be made
[45:50] and built to stand the pressure and only
[45:53] one thing can do it and that's when you
[45:55] come into God's molding house and be
[45:57] torn down and rebuilt a new creature in
[46:00] Christ Jesus because and then it's given
[46:06] to the next quote is from doors and
[46:08] doors you scroll up there brothers and
[46:11] guess where he's talking about the
[46:12] rapture coming and - two in the bed one
[46:16] in the field and all and then brother
[46:18] Graham says you know he said what good
[46:20] does this he says so when we gather in
[46:25] these meetings let's gather we for one
[46:27] purpose that's to serve God let's put
[46:29] our lives to business what good does it
[46:32] do us to impersonate something why will
[46:35] we accept a substitute when the whole
[46:38] skies
[46:39] are full of genuine Pentecostal power
[46:41] and blessings why should we accept a
[46:43] substitute you won't exhaust God's
[46:45] blessings ask abundantly so see it it's
[46:53] there for us we have we have the whole
[46:56] the Pentecostal power is there all the
[46:59] blessings are there and it's part of
[47:02] being made made new and not accepting a
[47:06] substitute or trying to try to make
[47:09] something happen there like he said go
[47:13] into God's molding house and allow him
[47:15] to mold you you know the clay doesn't
[47:19] have to do anything when the potter does
[47:21] the molding the clay is just there and
[47:27] that's the way we have to be in our
[47:29] lives to be just like that and just let
[47:33] God do his work in our lives and say
[47:35] Lord I just want to lay here and let you
[47:38] do the work and not try to push her you
[47:41] know that's listen to brother Bentham
[47:42] the other day and he was doing he was
[47:45] calling people out in the prayer line
[47:46] and he called a sister out and he and
[47:49] she had a need and he says he told her
[47:51] said you know you're trying to work up
[47:53] something you're trying to press into
[47:54] this and he said you need to stop that
[47:56] he said that won't work because you know
[47:59] she's trying to work herself into
[48:00] something but he told you no brother man
[48:01] was trying to speak to her tell her
[48:02] listen you need to have faith to accept
[48:05] your healing God knows what your need is
[48:07] and he's here to meet but you can't
[48:09] force it in you can't force yourself
[48:10] into something because you've got to
[48:13] just let him do the work because that's
[48:15] not faith trying to work yourselves into
[48:18] something this is from the message
[48:29] Abraham and Paul said it's no more me
[48:33] but Christ that liveth in me and if
[48:36] Christ lives in a man if Christ lives
[48:39] his life like he did when he was here on
[48:44] earth for he said so Christ lives his
[48:48] life like he did when he was up here for
[48:50] he said so he said a little while and
[48:52] the
[48:52] world won't see me no more but you shall
[48:54] see me for I will be with you to the end
[48:57] of the world and the things that I do so
[49:00] shall you do and he's raised from the
[49:02] dead and he's here now in the same power
[49:04] that he had when he was here on earth
[49:06] doing the same thing saving the same
[49:08] kind of people killing the same kind of
[49:11] sick showing the same kinds of visions
[49:14] and skip down to the to the next quote
[49:19] dear brother this is from principles of
[49:21] divine healing and and brother branham's
[49:23] speaks about Jesus Christ is our high
[49:28] priest of our confession and he goes on
[49:30] talking about the angel meeting him at
[49:32] greens meal and he says he told me to go
[49:37] and I'd be praying for statesmen and
[49:39] great men and kings and monarchs and it
[49:41] would sleep around the world and now
[49:42] there's a revival sweep in the world
[49:44] originating in Jeffersonville Indiana
[49:46] Amen oh how wonderful
[49:48] he said now kings and rulers and great
[49:49] men they don't deal in fanaticism he
[49:52] said now I will admit the devil's got
[49:54] scarecrows along the road he's got
[49:56] people who tries to impersonate
[49:57] something he's got people Devils got
[50:00] people that impersonate a Christian try
[50:02] to make people believe they're
[50:04] Christians when they're not but that's
[50:07] that don't take away the value of a real
[50:10] Christian to my opinion it makes them
[50:13] conspicuous we know we've got to have
[50:21] the counterfeit you got to have you've
[50:27] got to have the impersonators but I like
[50:31] what brother Bram said it makes them it
[50:32] makes it take it doesn't take away the
[50:34] value of a real Christian because you
[50:36] know that's what the devil wants to do
[50:38] the devil wants to point people to look
[50:41] at this person and look at that person
[50:42] but he says to his opinion it makes a
[50:45] real value it makes a real true
[50:47] Christian stand out because you know
[50:49] there you know people say well I you
[50:51] know I don't want to go Church anymore
[50:53] because there's nothing but a bunch of
[50:54] hypocrites there you know all they see
[50:56] is the hypocrites and the hypocrites but
[50:58] you know you have to have those but if
[51:00] you're really looking if you're looking
[51:02] at the hypocrites then what are you
[51:04] comparing them to
[51:06] there has to be a real true one to
[51:08] compare it to or you wouldn't know those
[51:10] were hypocrites if you didn't know that
[51:14] then you know the hypocrites are
[51:15] Christians yeah because that was what
[51:20] you would identify them with you know
[51:23] it's just like people say well you know
[51:24] they don't want to be around any
[51:26] hypocrites I got to stay away from the
[51:27] hypocrites you know but don't go to the
[51:29] store don't don't go anywhere you know
[51:34] Pete you can't go nowhere because you
[51:35] know everywhere you go you're gonna run
[51:36] into hypocrites if you if you can't go
[51:39] to church with wooden Joe they're going
[51:42] to be here that's just that's just the
[51:45] way it is brother Branham says he saw
[51:51] about having impersonations and and
[51:54] everything and from the message
[51:56] second-hand Row brother brems says he
[51:58] said told about things matching up
[52:00] people wanting things to match up and he
[52:05] says tell about your neighbor doing to
[52:08] whatever you know you do something your
[52:09] neighbor does that you know you wear a
[52:11] black hat they will to get a new set of
[52:12] clothes and you know they do the same
[52:14] thing and it's impersonation they want a
[52:15] match he says brother I don't care if my
[52:18] trousers match my coat or my shirt
[52:20] matches my tie
[52:21] I want my experience to match God's
[52:24] Bible he says that's the kind of
[52:26] matching that the church ought to do
[52:28] it's exactly right my lord raised from
[52:31] the dead and he's alive tonight he's
[52:33] your Lord also and he's here to bless
[52:36] you and to help you and he said and so
[52:43] to make it one or the other because he
[52:47] was speaking of the Bible being truth or
[52:49] error he says you know if it's if it's
[52:51] error he said I don't want to have
[52:52] nothing to do with it he said so make it
[52:55] one or the other Godspeed the day when
[52:57] so-called Christians will leave the
[52:58] profess to be Christians or either say
[53:01] what they are to begin with I'd rather
[53:04] be an infidel than a hypocrite that's
[53:06] right be what you are if you'll believe
[53:08] Christ say yes and don't just oh I
[53:11] believe this and I believe this and
[53:13] either believe it all or none of it it's
[53:16] God either
[53:18] God's Word or it's not God's Word if God
[53:21] didn't write it then if part of its
[53:24] wrong then the other parts wrong that's
[53:27] right
[53:29] so it's either all or nothing
[53:31] it's all part of God or it's not so we
[53:37] need to be completely sold out or not
[53:41] and accept all of it and he said he was
[53:45] praying for the day that people would
[53:47] come and either say it's all wrong or
[53:50] it's all right and that's the day that
[53:56] we live in today because we have many
[53:59] people that have you know walked in the
[54:01] message for many years and and claimed
[54:03] it to be truth and all of a sudden now
[54:04] you know was it you know the first off
[54:10] you know it was things that brother
[54:12] Branham preached were was wrong and then
[54:15] it became things that brother Branham
[54:17] done we're wrong and then you know then
[54:20] it's the Bible's wrong you know there's
[54:24] nothing in the scriptures right so none
[54:26] of it's right but you know they still
[54:29] they still want to be identified with
[54:30] God it's like well you know how do we
[54:34] know who God is or how do we even
[54:36] contact God because they don't even have
[54:39] anything well God is just the good
[54:41] thoughts of your mind or whatever but
[54:47] Road Ram says this is a very familiar
[54:51] quote from birth pains and and I'll be
[54:53] finished up here in a minute but brother
[54:56] brems says you know we know the old CD
[54:58] is must before the new seat can come out
[55:00] of the old seat it must rot exact
[55:02] absolutely not die only but right after
[55:05] it's dead we know that to be true that's
[55:08] the same thing in new birth we can never
[55:10] go back and and and we but we go forward
[55:14] when you're born again he said that's
[55:16] why I think today we have so many not so
[55:21] many rather genuine new birth is because
[55:24] the seat is maybe will sympathize with
[55:26] the word or the person but they don't
[55:29] want to rot away from the old system the
[55:32] they were in they don't want to come out
[55:34] of it they want to stay in the old
[55:35] system and claim the new birth or the
[55:38] message of the age you know a lot of
[55:42] people you can get a lot of people to
[55:43] sympathize with you you know some about
[55:47] you know people people want to have
[55:49] sympathy wit for you but you know the
[55:51] thing is you need to have compassion
[55:53] ya know sympathy empathy don't get
[55:57] anybody anywhere but compassion does
[56:01] compassion can change a situation and
[56:07] then the last quote is from the from the
[56:10] church age book you know brother Graham
[56:12] talks about needing that the accuracy of
[56:17] the word he said now don't let him would
[56:22] be being misled by what I have said and
[56:24] think that I do not believe in the
[56:26] accuracy of the word as we now have it I
[56:28] believe this word is accurate Jesus
[56:31] completely authenticated the Old
[56:32] Testament when here on earth and it was
[56:35] compiled exactly as was our New
[56:39] Testament make no state about it we have
[56:41] the infallible Word of God today and no
[56:43] man dares take from it or add to it but
[56:46] we have but we need the same spirit that
[56:48] gave it to teach it to us he said oh how
[56:52] we need the need revelation by the
[56:54] spirit he said we don't need a new Bible
[56:57] we don't need a new translation though
[57:00] some are very good and I'm not against
[57:02] them but we need the revelation of the
[57:05] spirit and thank God when we have what
[57:08] we need for God wants to reveal his word
[57:10] to us by his Spirit
[57:12] may God begin to give his spirit by his
[57:17] Spirit to give us continuous life-giving
[57:20] and prevailing revelation oh if the
[57:22] church could only get a fresh revelation
[57:25] and become by it the Living Word
[57:27] manifested we would do the greater works
[57:31] and glorify God our Father in Heaven
[57:35] amen
[57:37] that's what God wants from us oh how we
[57:41] need a fresh revelation from God
[57:45] you know I was brother Benno's SID and I
[57:51] don't have with me and I'll have to
[57:54] paraphrase it but I can get the quote
[57:57] for you but you know brother Brennan
[57:58] talks about he said one of the problems
[58:01] we have is he said we don't get the Holy
[58:03] Spirit he said lots of times we get one
[58:05] another spirit he said he said lots of
[58:08] times churches get the pastor's spirit
[58:10] and he's talking about watching how
[58:13] pastors act and he said watch the
[58:15] congregation do the same thing but he
[58:18] was talking about having a a pastor
[58:21] that's a real teacher and he said he
[58:25] said the I have to paraphrase him but he
[58:27] said the power of Hell will never shake
[58:29] that church and you know what I think
[58:33] God we have the ministry that we do I
[58:39] don't I don't know if he if that's the
[58:44] same one but I can find a world around
[58:48] talks about that he said the real he
[58:50] said that if you have a real true pastor
[58:54] that's a teacher he said the powers of
[58:57] Hell can't shake that church amen so I
[59:02] think that I think the Lord for the
[59:04] ministry that we have here I think we're
[59:08] blessed god bless you now let's stand
[59:15] hope it's been a blessing to you
[59:22] I don't want to be you know an
[59:29] impersonation I don't want to I don't
[59:31] want to be a replica I don't want to be
[59:34] a copy you know lots of times we find
[59:40] preachers and and you you you you see
[59:45] preachers and when you start to hear him
[59:48] preach you know they you can tell that
[59:50] they you know they're just like this
[59:53] other preacher you know and I think
[59:59] years ago I think it was a and I may be
[1:00:01] wrong but but you know I think it was a
[1:00:04] there was a preacher one time and he
[1:00:07] tried to impersonate brother Carroll
[1:00:09] about the way brother Carroll took his
[1:00:11] glasses off or something you know you
[1:00:13] know it was the first thing but carol
[1:00:15] had a little talk with him about that
[1:00:16] you know you know there's only one one
[1:00:19] brother Carol you know you need to be
[1:00:21] who you are not because trying to being
[1:00:24] a preacher is not it's not trying to
[1:00:26] impersonate somebody it's not trying to
[1:00:28] it's to be who you are who God made you
[1:00:30] to be so it's not us trying to you know
[1:00:36] act like a certain person and you know
[1:00:38] carry our Bibles a certain way or do
[1:00:40] certain things know be who you are be
[1:00:43] genuine God wants us to be who we are
[1:00:48] because this we're made was it say we're
[1:00:52] fearfully and wonderfully made God made
[1:00:54] you you know God didn't God did if God
[1:00:57] made you a certain way than you know if
[1:01:00] God's living in you and he's made you to
[1:01:03] and he's given you these characteristics
[1:01:05] and he made you look a certain way you
[1:01:06] know some people you know they spend
[1:01:08] their a whole entire life you know
[1:01:09] wanting to be taller or thinner or all
[1:01:13] these different things you know they
[1:01:14] don't want to be this or that but you
[1:01:16] know what there's lots of people in this
[1:01:18] world that you know it's so funny you'll
[1:01:20] take somebody in and they'll say you
[1:01:21] know I like this person you know there's
[1:01:24] you know for instance I wish I wish I
[1:01:27] could learn Spanish I wish I was
[1:01:28] bilingual us one thing I like about
[1:01:29] brother Luis I wish I could be like
[1:01:31] brother Luis I wish I was bilingual I'm
[1:01:34] good to get just learning
[1:01:35] English I took three years of Spanish in
[1:01:39] high school and I told them I said I
[1:01:41] walked in a new taco burrito and
[1:01:44] enchilada I come out and I could say uno
[1:01:49] dos tres cuatro Cinco seis yet the Ocho
[1:01:51] Nueve Diez taco burrito enchilada though
[1:01:59] there's a lot of there's a lot of time
[1:02:01] and effort
[1:02:01] some people are blessed that way you
[1:02:04] know I went to high school with a boy
[1:02:06] and learning other languages was not a
[1:02:10] problem to him he just he took Spanish
[1:02:14] took French and they saying don't speak
[1:02:15] people and had no problem I have a hard
[1:02:17] time and you know somebody speaks to me
[1:02:20] in Spanish I have no idea if I sit and
[1:02:23] stare at something that's written in
[1:02:24] Spanish I had enough that I could if I
[1:02:27] can kind of decipher it but you know
[1:02:29] it's a long it's a long process but you
[1:02:32] know there's a lot of people you know
[1:02:33] people look at somebody and they say
[1:02:35] well I wish I could be like that person
[1:02:36] I wish I you know there's certain things
[1:02:37] and you know there's people that look at
[1:02:39] you they say the same thing it's like I
[1:02:42] don't know about that but you know what
[1:02:45] there's people that want it that look at
[1:02:47] you and you know there's characteristics
[1:02:49] and each one of us there's things about
[1:02:50] each one of us that we will not look at
[1:02:53] and think that God put them there for a
[1:02:55] reason you know and because some people
[1:03:01] some people are you know some people say
[1:03:03] boy you know I wish I wish I was you
[1:03:06] know I stand up for myself more and just
[1:03:08] be more outspoken and some people say
[1:03:10] you know I hate doing that because
[1:03:11] sometimes being outspoken sometimes you
[1:03:14] say things and sometimes people will say
[1:03:16] things and not really mean what they're
[1:03:17] saying because the way it's perceived is
[1:03:20] wrong it's not what they're saying is
[1:03:22] wrong this way it's perceived as wrong
[1:03:23] and some people and some people you know
[1:03:25] they they they're so well I wish I
[1:03:27] wouldn't look like that it's like wow
[1:03:30] you know I wish I was like a certain
[1:03:31] person because they hold their tongue
[1:03:33] and the other person saying boy I wish I
[1:03:34] was more like them and talk up Spock up
[1:03:37] but you know God made each one of us
[1:03:39] different to be who we are and that's
[1:03:45] what we ought to be and be and be
[1:03:48] thankful I mean I know you
[1:03:49] and you know we all get things in our
[1:03:54] lives that we don't want we all have
[1:03:57] personality and traits and different
[1:03:58] things and you know there's lot of
[1:04:00] things that God give us the to work on
[1:04:02] to make us who we are you know because
[1:04:04] those are the trials that we go through
[1:04:05] but some things are blessings and we
[1:04:07] don't and people don't even want to
[1:04:08] believe that so god bless you tonight
