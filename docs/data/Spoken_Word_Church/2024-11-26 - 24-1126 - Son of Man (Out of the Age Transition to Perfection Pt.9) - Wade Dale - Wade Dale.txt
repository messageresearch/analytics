Hallelujah amen he truly is the way the truth and the life uh sister Rebecca you have a testimony you like to come give we're going to ask her to come at this time and give it to her enough y'all probably can hear me anyway um I just want to give two quick testimonies um just to reflect and just thank the Lord and um uh I think he comes in when I'm weak that's when I see him show up a lot so um it was one incident I wasn't I wasn't back in church yet but I I kind of started feeling the feeling that I needed to start going back to church this was in the past so um on the day I happened to show up we had a um a visitor so he came up and he gave a testimony on paying his tithes and uh he was like when he paid his tithes you know how God blessed him and everything and um so I was sitting in my seat I'm like well I was listening to him and I had like I had like um maybe $2 or $3 in my purse I don't know how much it was and um I started feeling a little bit of conviction like man maybe I need to start I need to start paying my ties I know it's right but I haven't been doing it so um I said well maybe when I get paid next time I just start from a fresh or whatever and so um it was another feeling that came over like just pay whatever you you got if you got $3 pay 30 cents pay 10% out of it right so I end up putting the 30 cents in the TI's basket and um I said okay I'm starting today then so that same week um I took Isaac Isaac was probably about five I took him to the shoe store some money came in from somewhere I think from his dad to get him some shoes so we went to the shoe store and um if you have little boys my my Isaac he was very active so you can't just go buy like $5 tennis shoes that'll be Tor in the first week you know so I was like well I think I probably had like $50 and I was like well let's get something maybe $45 or something with a little bit of quality in it right so um he was looking in the Jordan section everybody know Jordans cost a lot right so he was looking in the expensive section and Wan the best shoes I'm like I said we can't do that you got to come on this side so um this lady overheard us and she was like um let him pick whatever shoe he want so I'm like are you sure she was like yeah let him pick whatever shoes he want I'm like man that change everything you know so I'm like I don't even know what to pick now you know so he's looking and looking at everything and I guess we're taking too much time and she's like she said um finally finally she's getting ready to leave so she's like here's like I think she gave me $300 she was like here's $300 or $200 something in that 100 list she like just let them pick and y'all take your time or whatever I like are you sure but anyway the point is God is so good and he do open up the windows and I just it just reflect back to that little 30 cents I put in that basket or 20 cents so that was one testimony but God is so faithful and um he met us when we needed it because Isaac was in Need for sure um the second one is it was a situation this is a weak moment again where God definitely showed up and this happened um recently but I was at a customer house and uh this particular customer I wasn't it was to me it was Pastime for me to go it was too many little things happening and I was feeling uncomfortable and um uh I I just kind of went ahead and gave him one last shot just to get the house cleaned for him so um he ended up uh in my point of view kind of belittling me a little bit and um when I showed up and so ain't going to lie y'all I felt I I felt a little flurry inside I was feeling myself getting a little bit flurry you know like okay I Lord I don't know how I'm going to be able to clean this house feeling anger inside you know so um anyway I just walked off and I I just started working and somehow God help me to stay humble and calm but inside I was I was feeling upset I ain't going to lie so um I was feeling upset and I was reflecting on other stuff that already had happened and um I was like Lord I can't be in this man house feeling this way about him and you know just help me because I feel like just spraying and wiping stuff and hurry up and getting out of there you know that's how I felt but I was like Lord please help me so something came over me and was like just do it as you're doing it unto me you know and that really helped me calm down in each room just take my time do it right and just you know just I kept saying the Lord help help me in each room help me cuz I it take me probably like 4 hours but it felt like it was taking forever cuz I was feeling that feeling inside so um but the Lord helped me to calm down and um after after I left he called me the next day he was like when I woke up I just felt like um he said you can feel the clean you can feel the clean and I was like yeah thank the Lord for that cuz definitely if I just did it on my own you would have felt something else but um but no I just want to thank the Lord he's so good and he just shows up and he understands all of your all of my feelings and you can't hide it from him he knows when the courage you know comfort you he knows when to You Can't Hide and just say I'm not feeling it I don't you know he knows he knows when to show up and I'm just so grateful for him I don't know what I'd do without him each step of the way I won't lie so just want to lift him up that's it amen so thankful for those testimonies they may seem little but I'll tell you um you never know how God can use your testimony to you get up and tell it or tell it to somebody and um I remember you told that testimony about Isaac and it just shows how he's own time God you know a present help in the time of need but something else you just said that just um um reminded me of the situation there clean and you said the Lord said whatever you do do it unto me that is such a key we were recently um at our tree practice and one of the ministers there started to talk to the kids about a a little sermonette and he used that scripture he said whatever you do do it unto the Lord whatever you do even if your parents say you know you need to do this and you need to clean your room instead of being angry say Lord I want to do it for you in everything you do do it and it changes your attitude of what you do whether good or bad or how you feel do it unto him and you'll receive more of a blessing you'll receive more of a presence of God come into the atmosphere and it just you don't worry about the temporal things in God I live my life for you I wake up every day I go to work I don't like the job I don't like this but I'm doing it for you and it makes it worthwhile Because He Lives we can live also amen let's all stand holy words long preserve forever in

Wayward lord it's short time bring them home what a great Thanksgiving to have your kid come back home to have your husband or wife or mom or dad come back home I don't mean home in a house I mean home to you Lord amen cuz that's the only place that's the only safe place there is is in you father just cover us with your wings Lord today just give us our daily bread and forgive us of our many mistakes that we make Lord just bless us now in Jesus name amen read Malachi 4 real quick and then you'll be seated for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah all that do wickedly shall be stubbled we don't want to be in that group there is a way out right and the day cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet and the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in horror before all Israel with the statutes and judg behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers now we know that's two people right same coming of Elijah but it's two different people John the Baptist did one then brother randam did the other are the Elijah of the end time is doing the other one we'll break that down in just a minute lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you may be seated the Lord as blessing also read Revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we have heard that voice this is Tuesday night this not Wednesday night it's Tuesday night you've only had one day of work since Sunday you ought to be happy tomorrow's the day you're supposed to H go when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets Revelations 18:3 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich to the abundance of her Delicacies that's what's coming now that's what's coming right I'm telling you that's what's coming now and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God ha remembered her iniquities thank God we're not in that group thank God there is a group of people that that will not ever happen to and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ our sins actually did go to heaven it actually went to hell and then God destroyed him and he went to heaven and then he come back on the day of Pentecost to live inside of a group of people amen cuz we're going to be reward rewarded but she's going to be re rewarded double unto her according to her works and the cup which she has filled filled to her double there's a Time coming folks that this is just we're sitting here today and we're I was thinking yesterday um we sit here today and we we have a Thanksgiving and junor and I went to the went to uh kroger just a few minutes ago and uh buggies were full people were driving in and Mercedes and buying groceries and buying stuff and you and I are going to do the same thing may not be in a Mercedes but we're going to go buy stuff and we're going to take it home and we're going to eat it we're living good right now but there's going to come a time that there's something going to come to where you and I are not going to be able to do this anymore I want you I know you say well I know brother Brown said that well you know what it's going to come to pass amen and if we believe we're the end time people going to be in your life this is going to happen okay but don't be scared God said he would take care of us hello God said he would take care of us now the listen the government can say they take care of you baloney your boss said he'll take care of you baloney your job says it'll take care of you baloney God's the only one that'll ever take care of you and we got to put our faith in him let that be our thanks given that we put our faith in him and that his faith work let his faith be the one that takes us out of here amen this is a quote that that um Tim read and I'll read it again cuz it's look what a message for the occasion to me they were sitting there thinking what does this got to do with Thanksgiving brother randam I'm sure he caught their thought you may say what's this all got to do with Thanksgiving what you talking about brother them here it is quarter to nine you didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving what a message for the occasion to me they didn't get it they didn't get he was preaching the greatest Thanksgiving M message that ever was is that there's going to be a bride that's being separated from the world as he said the pilgrim fathers were separated from the old English denomination and Creed they could marry to a new anointed word for their age uh brother Tim and I were talking afterwards I I've looked back in a few um uh looked back at the history of Washington and and Jefferson and and Benjamin Franklin and all those people uh there was never a recording it was never recorded they went back to England when they separated they left that place right they probably left the house over there they probably left family and possessions now of course they may have come on later but when they came that's why Jesus stood one day and he said I didn't come to bring peace he said I come to bring a sword he said father's going to be against mother children against their fathers amen that's hard to believe but you look at it it's in my life and it's in yours right now there is a division between Christianity and somebody that's not a Christian if you're if you're in that gray area and that your your kids don't know the difference you need to get to praying or if you're brother or family member or somebody don't know that you are different you've been separated you look different you act different you do different things then you got a problem right amen separated and then what we're going to connect to though is marry to the new anointed word for their age well what's the anointed word for our age is to come to a resurrection and then a body change and then we'll leave this place all right it's not to come to justification it's not to just come to sanctification it's not just to come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll read it to you in a few minutes remember brother Bram said the Holy Ghost comes and then the Holy Ghost he makes way for the Holy Ghost himself well that sound to a theologian that would sound kind of strange but I understand it completely but we'll read it to in just a few minutes so we can be thankful as pilgrims like Abraham separating oursel from the things of the world all of our Associates Abraham was a pilgrim gone God has separated us from all the dead religions speaking Across the Nation now all the dead Creeds separated us and opened to us a new land now watch a new message for this day amen right for this day Pentecost dried up and died like Luther Wesley and the rest of them it's no more than a bunch of church churches pulled together good people has got to come out and we know that we were one of those people some of us may not even been born during that time but some were and you were in denominational uh ideas and Pentecost and all those different things so what did he do now here's what we going to look he opened something was closed something was closed down through all the church ages that no man could get a hold of everybody with me you see how special this message is no one I'm talking about Paul all the way to the Great Men coming up to the day of Pentecost 1906a Street the word was not fully opened until the prophet in the end time broke those SEALS or the lamb broke those seals amen amen that's why I'm telling you this transition we got a transition and I believe now I see what Paul's saying we got to go on to Perfection not laying aside not let not preaching on water baptism all the time not preaching on you got to be good all the time right I know you got to do do that cuz there's a mix the audience and there's different people here at different levels but you still we've got to come to a realization that unless you see now not me unless you see that the seals have been opened to you you will not take a body change right amen do y'all hear an amen amen you will not take a body change you will go by the grave if that seal is not open to you completely I'll read it in just a few minutes but brother Brown said that pretty much he opened up the Seven Seals of the last message you notice that the Seven Seals which all the mysteries of the seven Church Ages was sealed with Seven Seals the reformers didn't have time to do it in their day they didn't live long enough but this blessed revelation of the Seven Seals is open to us in this last day do you believe that do you believe now we we do have an open book we'll prove it to you in just a minute I know you've read it before we're going to read it again just to review for a little while healing is the children's bread 1965 it's in the atonement and the atonement first is applied to our souls and healing has always forerun every message I'm slowing down now because I keep forgetting Louis is in there and it's also been a means to gather people together so we know and we've been through it over and over again healing can campaign got the attention of the people Turned the Lights On to healing but brother brandham said that was a minoren we're we're trying to Major on that minor everybody loves the healing campaign but when brother randam transitioned he he already transitioned to Perfection right cuz he did that when the seals open he transitioned over into Perfection and his brother Dell's always told us he said you read the titles after the seals is talking about eternity and it's bringing something so positive way more positive than than we're guessing who mzc is but brother R says who is this mzc all the different things Mighty God unveiled before us invisible Union of the bride of Christ why did he preach that after the seals because it was an open book amen so the atonement is first applied our soul that's why it's so important to be born again if you're not born again hurry hurry cuz you'll get left behind if you're not and healing is always forun every message and it's also been a means to gather the people together many people will sponsor a healing campaign or meeting many will come to it or song festival but when it comes to a poor lost soul to get get saved there's not many people interested in that but that's the main thing Divine Healing and singing festivals and so forth brother BOS what you says the bait on the hook and you show the fish the bait not the hook why because you won't catch anything if you show them the hook all right but show them the bait let them get close enough to they can bite on it and then you can bring them in by what by your life now listen your life is the bait on the hook right amen the Hook's Christ the Hook's not you right the hook is Christ the bait is your life lived in front of somebody wanting to bite the same hook you bit amen amen praise God and that's just the thing to get the people to listen a while till you can really present to them your message that's what it's been all these years we've been fighting down through these ages and we've been we've been listening to different ones and listening to different ones and listening to different ones to now I believe that it's honing time it's honing time to where it's going to hone down to where if you're not in you're out and I don't mean a church I mean you that's right right God has did that in every age through every age there's always been a healing campaign and if it's a genuine healing campaign behind that campaign always is a message there's never a sign given just just for a sign it's for running a message now let me clear something up real quick I know that that some of you that that look around in the message and different things which is fine but there's a lot of people especially the ones just left the message their big their big hangup is is that that brother brandham stole stuff from different people right why is everybody with me I know some of you that's been around you know what I'm talking about that he stole it wasn't a wasn't this great mystery that he opened all right he got it from scoffield or he got it from Clarence Lin or he got it from whoever that other brother was and all the different ones even he listed them he said he looked at their at their um messages amen but remember they did not have a campaign like brother randam had they Clarence Lin was right everybody with me but he a prophet he didn't have everything he was a and that's a that to me that's a paradox that Scofield can talk about we were talking about it Sunday at at the restaurant Clarence LA or Scofield was back in the early 1900s or 1800s 1900s and he talked about a theophany in his writings right down if you'll look in your writings right here right below his commentary he calls it a theophany and he talks about all these different things that brother Brandon read but scoffield was a trinitarian right right so he didn't have he couldn't get all the way out as brother brandham said he couldn't get out of that denomination he was in right everybody with me but brother brandom I he I listen I steal sermons all the time right so what my brother asked me he said he said brother wait do you steal people's sermons I said every service amen Jesus preached him and I'm preaching them again I'm stealing from him brother Brandon preached 1100 sermons I picked the quotes out I'm preaching from him so I'm a I'm a thief Hey listen a thief is coming after a thief he said I'll come as a thief in the night I just got that so I am a thief like brother Dale said he's L A Jacob we're Jacob we're shyers we want the word more than anything and if we do then what's God going to do that's the birthright you and I are birthed under we're birthed under that we're not birthed under something else we're not birthed under eating porridge and helping Daddy and doing good cuz L Esau did good Esau was a good guy he was a worker he took care of daddy he went and hunted and shot the game and and Jacob really didn't do a whole lot except stay around his mama his brother said under his mom's coattail but when it come down to the birthright which you and I have have that Birthright tonight the new birth you want it more than anything you don't care how you get it that's right exactly I don't know about you but that's the way I see it amen so there were signs given there was there was people that preach the truth listen Martin Luther preached the truth or he wouldn't have been a church age messenger Right Wesley preached the truth but they didn't preach all the truth they didn't get us to Perfection there was no transition the book was Clos they knew what they were talking about to a degree only ones at the end time look now brother randam is telling us and I'm we're going to separate it right here in just a second the very day when this messenger not when he starts on now look not when he starts what the healing campaign so listen brother brand was message was not a healing campaign amen right now it came right it was part of the message right but what was that remember that was a minor you can't take a body change by listening to the prayer lines of the tapes that's right amen amen there's a lot of people I know that that's all they'll do is listen to prayer line CU they get all emotional they get all that that's okay but that's a minor everybody with me that's a minor right major healing is the body change am amen amen not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message now when did he begin to declare his message I believe according to what I see in the in the uh message of the hour about the time he got on the spoken words Original Seed he was getting there cuz remember he thought he had s he SED a seed he said I'll read here in a few minutes he sowed a seed he had everything he said soed the entire word but as of yet Malachi 4 had not been completely fulfilled that's right he thought he was at the end he was done got him out on a limb Lord what do I go next the Holy Ghost said Hey listen buddy pick up your pen and I want you to write this down so this is not hearsay if we believe he was a prophet we believe the Holy Ghost wrote that with his hand with brother B's hand so I believe that that is truth then he said as of yet Malachi 4 has not been fulfilled it had been started but it wasn't fulfilled that's right all right and that's okay listen I'm not so dogmatic that I cut the prayer line off and don't and don't listen to it when I or read it when I'm reading a book I don't listen to many sermons I read right but I want to get to meet first if I don't understand what he's saying there I don't it's not going to give me any good over here healing is wonderful we all need something in our body tonight that needs to be healed but it's only temporary that's right brother BR you said you could be healed of cancer one day and die the next is that what we saiding right one day difference but we love it but it's a secondary it's a mind let's major on the major right because remember when the when the book begins to be open as we're going to see here in a minute when that book begins to be open a lot of people didn't follow through that amen they stayed back here they didn't go any further with him they stayed in Old Pentecost and they enjoyed the tongues and they enjoyed this and they enjoyed that but when brother Brown started preaching this message people started going away right Holy Ghost filled people didn't turn him down they just couldn't go as far as he went because it wasn't for their age just like I read y'all the other night in this in the six seal the questions and answers he says gone from you not for you just live a good simple Christian Life In other words these things will be brought up now that the book is open there's going to be a book open book people that's going to understand and not going to have any problem when brother Ram says God and Christ are one not going to have any problem I was reading the seals again or listening to them the other day coming back and so adamant brother randam is talking about God being one right when that first seal opened that was the one God now he got a one God Revelation before but this was solidified when he saw something else go away and God was standing there now brother R wasn't God but the lamb was standing there Lamb's only could open the seal so so who was it was a lamb through his voice everybody with me it was a lamb here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes somebody if there's two therefore one's got to be true and one's got to be false righten pretty simple but they didn't get that right did it stop people from believing in a trinity no they just shut the book back up and went off again right right all right first PLL healing second pull prophecy now we can get and we'll get into the Visions here a little bit later on because the first pool was remember it was fishing and it was catching little fish and it was uh getting stuff all tangled up the line all tangled up and brother talking about tying up baby shoes that's all an allegory that's all something that brother R breaks it down right here in this one quote right here the first pull was The Healing Ministry all right catching trying to get the fish in the second pull was taken not taken by the hand anymore but remember when he come into that second pull he was telling them the thoughts and intents of their heart is that right and it was perfect never missed it one time not one time right so he's heading into that transition to perfection even in the second Paul right but under that prophecy there was imitation oh yeah right brother Brown said Remember the angel said they can't imitate this right when we get to the third pull the opening of the word the Myster is revealed Satan can't go there folks that's what's going to destroy Satan is that we're going to separate from him right everybody with me amen amen I was looking at at all of our bodies you know um something like I said something's wrong with everybody we just we just literally got to deny this outside of our self just deny it it ain't it's like brother um who oh brother Jimmy Harris he said this just ain't so this is not what we supposed to be right this came to get us to a place but this thing is just rotten it's just it stinks but the thing inside of you is worth 10,000 worlds let's feed that thing amen yes sir right now look third pull the opening of the word the mystery revealed no more now look there's no more higher order to reveal the word then prophets so he had to step in now he was a prophet from birth anybody with me but he was fulfilling the second part of his prophetic Ministry when he stood there and started opening those seals we'll get to in just a second but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember the third pull was the opening now here's what the third pull is wake up and realize the third pull is the opening of the seals when that Mighty angel came down to Revelations 10 right and the voice came from the seventh angel John listened to him because he was Tope of the Bride right and that seventh angel messenger did not have the book come on we'll read it in a minute that book was in the hand of the mighty angel that Mighty Angel give it to John but it took a seventh angel Messenger to what literally turn us to Christ the real person now he wasn't false back here but I'll read it to you in a minute because I've read it to you many times before brother rown said the Holy Ghost can only work on what you give it right because it's been bound by two by denominations for 2,000 years bound the Holy Ghost has been bound by what our Traditions that River e frates is in your brain it ain't a river Over Yonder there's not a bunch of you know people holding down your thoughts and ideas contrary to the word of God remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word they could not get it it was sealed up all right end time seed sign there's a revival going on what is it a sewing you don't hear very much of Billy Graham no more this is 1962 all right now look 1962 things were winding down in that first part of the ministry even his he'll say even mine what about oral what about the rest of them you know the great Revival fire is not burning what is it it's the end time seed sign the words has been sown what is it denominational will reap denominational that makes them Confederate themselves together now somewhere folks we're living in that time where we're going to see every church denomination come together under one head right amen come on don't don't un amen that that's exactly what's going to happen we're going to be left out right but the word of God has been seed also and when the spirit of God begins to fall now watch when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God will live in the people this is not a tape Ministry this is a live People Ministry right amen and that false bride that's committed adultery out there and brought herself into Creeds and sold out her Birthright will reap what a confederation of church that's to be bound and burned like thorns and thistles but where the word of God's been swed into the people's heart former rain is the sewing rain we have been under that rain for a long time God's getting ready to harvest he's going to send the Harvest rain to harvest what he planted from the day of Pentecost to the today amen I believe that with all my heart it will reap a bride for Christ as certain as I'm standing here end time signs and 1962 this is where I'll quote this where brother brandham talks about pick up your pen and WR this is 1962 God has promised be careful God has promised Malachi 4 for this last day and Malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled all right is everybody with me that's 1962 yep now the first part of it had been fulfilled but not the whole completion of it right all right we'll break it down in just a minute for it is a gerti word of God spoken through Malachi the prophet Jesus referred to it it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second time listen close all scripture that's not been fulfilled must be before that time the Bible has to be finished to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives but of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible from from the serpent to the messenger in the former Reign then he will be rejected who's he talking about himself that's right right then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefather John and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord restoration of the brid tree now what we got to do is we've got to now we're going to start separating all right everybody with me come out of her my people all right because if you look at brother brandham all during his messages up until here in 62 he pretty much talks about three manifestation justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody with me all right now when you get to 1962 the restoration of the Bride tree um spoken words Original Seed some other messages I only brought one quote but there's several others he talks about four all right cuz you got to restore back the full word right amen all right the full word if four messengers of death killed the tree for messengers of life will restore it I will restore he's not going to restore just part of the limbs he's going to restore that tree back to the leaves then to the seed he's not going to just start with and have half limbs over here and some of them dead no he's going to restore the whole tree back right amen sir by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word now wasn't that the word I want you to get they they didn't teach all false word they had truth but they didn't have all the truth right they were not working under an open book and they will be in Bride they will be the bride amen amen come on Martin Luther will have a group that stand over there in the sixth Dimension waiting on us to bring them here John Wesley's waiting on a group over there even John Smith and different ones white moody right but they never had a complete message like this prophet in the end time that's right they never had a completion they never were required to bring everything back to way it was before that's right here's where in the Masterpiece I read it to you the other day justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I hope you realize in this church we believe in those works of Grace am we believe in every one of them and we believe in going over them again right huh sir there a higher form brother BR says of justification a higher form of sanctification cuz sanctification W even make you bride now but sanctification under the I Die daily in the in the uh statute of perfect man will make you better will make you a what a mature Christian right and mature Christians is what God's looking for right he's not looking for a bunch of babies sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right if you got one justification two sanctification three the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself all right to me that's the open book because remember in 1957 I read you this quote several times we need something to work on before the Holy Ghost can ever go to work that's why brother Brown stood there that day and he said he's been bound bound for 2,000 years by Creeds whose Creeds your Creeds their Creeds the world's Creeds he's been bound but he's got to have something to work with you know that's right we grieve the Holy Ghost yes sir I'm sorry Point your finger at me if you never felt Grieves in your heart you don't have the Holy Ghost right amen oh I just don't have that kind of I don't live that kind of life well I don't live that kind of life either that I used to before but I do live a human life somebody ever cut you off I'm not going there that's the biggest one people cutting somebody off in a car it's just demon cars I guess I don't know but you start talking about that and everybody's like go ahead it's just a car just a driver I used to do the same thing but now I say bless them Lord don't let them have a wreck it's those little things that don't make me no be anybody else I but I don't like I'm not going to stop and help somebody on the side of the road I'm sorry unless God brings my car and rolls it over in front over here and off the side I ain't going to stop helping nobody I'm just sorry I'm that way but if the Lord directs me I sure will but I I drive by I said Lord send them somebody better than me that can work on that car that can get that car going cuz if I stop and that you know the motor blowed up I'm just going to go what I do what are you going to do if they got a flat tire and they don't have a spare and you don't have a spare you're still worthless but God send somebody by them by there that's got a spare tire I may be crazy but I believe I just believe God will do it too and I don't have to look back in the rear ofie mirror to figure out if you did or not right aren't we supposed to make this world better this world is never better without the bride the bride makes the world a better place amen that's right so her messenger in Malachi 4 he's promised to do it and the messenger this the birth pain is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth not a new New Birth everybody with me not a new way he's bringing back the old way that happened on the day of Pentecost to today not shaking a hand not speaking tongues not this not that that everybody has decided this is what's going to happen to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 what do Malachi 4 birth do it turns you back to the original faith of the fathers all right now let's break it down real quick maybe we'll just stop at the end of this this is from the lean Church age now we read this many many times before now brother R tells us this messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 is going to do two things all right we kind of slide through these things sometimes and don't break them down but let's break them down for a minute number one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers what is that the hearts of the Babylon Pentecostal baby children that believe speaking in tongues is it that believes that they have to have a healing campaign that believes they have to have a shout that believes they have to have tongues and interpretations they service or they're lost hello right right right but what does it do Brother Anderson when God turns your heart back to the original faith of the fathers you're born again right you get the new birth you are redeemed amen all right everybody with me amen y'all must be thinking about turkey that's okay Revelations 5 so let's turn to Revelations 5 let's break this down just a few minutes now remember the messenger Malachi for is to do two things one he's to turn the hearts what is your heart your heart is not what thumps your heart is your soul amen amen he's going to turn your soul back to the faith of the fathers your soul was what claimed by the devil that old nature was attached to it and brother Tim was talking about and I've said we all said it many times before and unless your old husband's dead you can't get born again amen you cannot marry Christ if you have a living husband amen that's just a fact can't hang him up he's got to be dead amen so that's what brother Ram come preaching get the new birth remember the healing campaign bring them in preach to them Christ bring them in preach to them Christ not not so much Mysteries right sure he went in he went in all that but remember he said If Ever I bring a a message of of Doctrine I bring it at the Tabernacle right so now let's go to Revelations 5 now what is Revelations 5 Revelations 5 is redemption plain and simple amen that's where you see yourself redeemed right right but not mature right right I prove it to you in Revelations 10 why would we need a mighty Angel to come down with an open book if everything of redemption is over in Revelations 5 we know it is we know redemption's over as many people say you know you can't get saved because redemption's over and 1963 the the this person came off The Mercy Seat brother brandham was projecting a mystery down to right here today there will be a day amen there will be a day when Jesus steps off of that mercy seat and it becomes a judgment seat and listen he's not going to sit down again that's right he's not going to reset down in the in the in the uh as the denomination say you can get saved after the Rapture takes place when he gets up off that Mercy Seat when that last name is called what's you going to do with an open book going to close it amen and it's going to be closed until you see it in Book of Revelations 19 2021 when the book was open amen amen but that's a judgment book then that's not a book of redemption that's a book of judgment right am I correct all right so now I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed all right so it was sealed up with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth nor under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look on it this book was so sacred there was only one person that could take this book right now remember who was sitting on the throne the father everybody with me God the man that took the book back from Adam amen held it until Christ came and then Christ had to die and go on to release the names out of this book The Lamb took the book and opened it and the reading of the names of everyone in that book started on the day of Pentecost and every sermon that was preached every name that was called everyone that was born again was in that book and their name was called right tonight he's calling your name do you hear it amen right right John had a fit when he saw his name amen and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders saying unto me said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah now we can get in all these symbols but not tonight the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and loose those Seven Seals they loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld in low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders now who are the four Beast that's your new birth all right so under this message of Malachi 4 let me give you a little hint if you don't see your name in the book it wasn't there to begin with right amen exctly if you don't see your name that that that that God sent us a prophet to show us who we are in that book then you got a problem I can see my name and everything from from from from when God in Genesis 3:15 said I'll put enmity between thy seed and a woman's seed and I'm going to come and I'm going to bring it back together well who' he bring it back together for right us amen he brought it back together for me and you right when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them hearts and golden vows full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints don't think your prayer doesn't mean anything it's mentioned right here and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and nation and H has made un look made us what did this taking of the book do he redeemed what was in the book now wasn't open yet right he took the book out of the hand of the owner the original owner and then he opened them then he opened the book right right all right and what did that do during that time it made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth I beheld and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders the number of them were 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousands boy what a bride saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings you and I proclaimed with a loud voice when you got born again I don't care if you just said Thank You Lord that's right that rang into eternity all the angels in heaven said another one another one's been called there's another one that's come that's me so worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches but what's he going to do with that though he's going to transfer it to a bride cuz he's fixing to take what the power that's in this book that's sealed up he's fixing to give it to somebody everybody with me all right we'll be done in just a second let's read what brother Bram said now look he's not an animal he took the book in a Syle form he was a lamb but it was a human being it was your kinsman redeemer it was God in human flesh right he took the book out of the right hand of him that s on the throne who was it the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand No Angel no Angelic being nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture the most Sublime thing in the scripture an act that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne what is it now it belongs to the lamb amen right okay now this book doesn't belong to the father we know they're the same person is just a transfer of power right because remember what does right hand mean right hand's power right he didn't just take it like brother Brown said from a big old right hand right no he took the power and gave it to the lamb because the lamb was worthy the breach now watch real close this is something you must get now he has been doing his mediatorial work making intercession for the believer for 2,000 years what church ages is everybody with me for 2,000 years he'd been back there a lamb now he's stepping forth from eternity to take the title deeded book right and to break the seals right and reveal the Mysteries when of it at the end time amen that's right do you get it I'll say it again at the end time all right we'll go on then now break the seals and release all the Mysteries to them all right to the seventh angel whose message is to reveal all the mysteries of God the mysteries of God lays in these Seven Seals see that's what he said here all the Mysteries lays in these Seven Seals excuse me and the lamb comes forth now from being a mediator between God and man all right the lamb right right he now becomes a lion right a lion of the tribe of Judah come to take over he's come to possess you yes Body Spirit and soul amen amen that's his right now watch when he becomes a line he takes the book that's his rights remember he bought us the rights yes amen he's the one that bought our Redemption right amen nobody but now the lamb comes nobody could take the book it's still in the hands of God no Pope priest whatever it might be they can't take no the book The Seven Seals hasn't been revealed see but when the mediator when his work is done as an intercessor he comes forth and John the Elder said he's a lion he comes forth so what is he doing now he's got the book brother R said 2000 00 years he's had the book amen I'm going read it again right 2,000 years nobody could take it Pope priest all the Mysteries laid in the seals there be the release when this only the seventh angel only the seventh angel is this released to all right and we're recipients of that seventh angel that's right cuz we are the voice we hear the voice and become the voice yes right everybody with me so one he's to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers help us realize we've been born again and we still got some extra to do amen right we still got some extra yes cuz this thing's got to be open somewhere between Revelations 5 and Revelations 10:7 the book got open but then who showed up John John showed up in this whole scenario right so two now watch the second part and then we'll we'll close right after we get done with this two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders not in the first part not in Revelations 5 never Revelations 5 is your Redemption right no doubt but there's more to it than that we got to defeat the devil on I guess y'all don't want to this ought to excite you it's ought to make you happy that this is happening to you not somebody else you amen he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders the only way he can do it is what with an open book right that's why brother B always refers to Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 amen cuz he said according back over here I'll read it one more time now this m of Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 he's putting the two scriptures as part of his ministry one is going to what it's like I said it's going to show the Redemption of the people how it's done then two the Mysteries are going to be revealed which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed the only way it can be divinely revealed is when if Christ reveals it it's why we had to have a prophet a conduit that Christ could speak through that's right all right everybody with me reveal these mystery truths that literally literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers in other words literally changes your body right so now let's read this for a second and then we'll hear Brother Brown comment a few times and we'll close Revelations 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven I like the way God hides that cuz it said another another Mighty Angel and that's a little a you wouldn't think that was Christ you think CU listen there's angels all through Revelations a man another Angel come down another Angel spoke amen but brother R said only Christ is is and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven you know why he said that cuz look Revelations one tells you who the that is he's clothed with a cloud Rainbow on his head face with his a son feet his pillows of fire but he had something in his hand he had in his hand a little book open amen right and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth what was he doing he was taking possession he was taking possession and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar remember he was a lamb now he's coming over here to be the lion because remember what does a prophet do a prophet brings you and I the truth and eternal life and Redemption but what does it do to the people that rejects him right it seals him away in a different group they turn him away so this is Judgment a prophet brings judgment because brother Brown threw the thing up he said judgment will strike the West Coast why didn't Billy Graham do that why didn't or Roberts do that wasn't for them to do it it took a prophet to do that the voice of God to do that and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write all right we're going to stick something in here real quick because we'll cover them in just a little bit later on in the service sermon he was about to write what he saw so there was something there for him to write amen everybody with me it wasn't seven people it wasn't seven voices of seven men that was a that was a doctorine a long time ago well guess what all them seven men are passed away amen so that voice is silence right don't put it on a man let Christ do it amen but John was about to write it and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not we'll get into what brother Bram says about that a little bit later no it not tonight and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven who you talking about and the things that they are in the earth things that they're in the sea things that they're in that there should be time no longer right you and I don't have a time you and I don't have a time Israel has a time this same scene is in the Book of Daniel but it's seen by Daniel which is a Jew given to the Jew and it says time times and dividing of times they have three and a half years you and I have had 60s something years of ministry from brother brandham or longer 70 amen right it's about time for time to be over all right so John says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard now this is John who I John is ey right all right now don't get up and leave he's not talking about that seventh angel anymore come on you with me brother Dell told us a long time ago John inserted that in knowing that the seventh angel when he was writing all that other stuff about I don't say stuff but all those other uh First Church age down to number seven he knew they had to be a Prophet come on the scene and he screamed out but in the days of the voice of that man these things will happen but it won't be him that fulfills it all amen everybody with me and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me now look these eyes and mes are John amen these eyes and mes are you and I that's right that's right or I and me and you right CU John tops the entire bride right everybody with me we'll be done right here and I The Voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now look if it hadn't have been for that verse seven we wouldn't have known where it came from right amen we wouldn't have known where it was going to come from but from that seventh Angel's message is going to come an open book Hallelujah an open book to me and youen yes sir amen amen and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me John yes and said go and take the little book that now listen remember he's not talking to the seventh angel anymore right the seventh angel has one thing to do sound a voice right right sound a message right somebody's got to pick that up so John being typ of bride picks it up everybody with me amen and I John bride went unto the angel now remember the seventh angel never had that book in his hand hello I know that hurts your feelings but show it to me it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to Servants of prophet didn't say he had that book in his hand right but we know where it had to come from it had to come from that seventh angel but he's not here right now right amen so he can't fulfill what's coming in scripture right right sorry but and I went unto the angel what the angel that had the book who's got the book The Mighty Angel Christ has that book that's why brother brandom he stopped right there in the middle of of the of the seals and he said he said this has been the most what Supernatural happening in my whole Ministry in other words why he knew he wasn't preaching the seals God was preaching them the lamb was preaching them amen the lamb was doing all the work cuz brother Rand going tell you and we'll read it first seal he said i' made a horrible mistake second seal he first seal he said I don't know what the second seal is third or fourth seal he goes back and says I was looking at some old notes in 1958 brother Brandon preached the mighty conqueror I read it the other day myself and he read that scripture Revelations when the first seal was open that that was a mighty that that was a mighty conquer the Holy Ghost he thought the fifth sealed Jew which he didn't think was a fifth sealed Jew he thought it was the bride the souls under the altar hello somebody I'm not I'm not belittling brother random I'm telling you how perfect that that transition from this over here to this over here went from partial to perfect am amen he never went back and preached that again he preached it all right here and we're not going to throw our books away and our tapes away from 47 to 63 without that the mighty Angel's not coming to you right right and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book I want it so bad and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter look and he said unto me John the bride and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen listen what brother Brown said in the breach at the sounding of the seventh Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends that through these Church ages have been probed at will be wound up together and now watch and when the seals are broke and the Myster is revealed down comes the angel oh which one the mighty Angel right the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of this coming so at the time of that descending of the not the person not the flesh person Jesus what Christ Christ is the anointed one right the not a he's the anointed right amen so the seventh angel had to be there to grab that anointing come on he had to grab that anointing and he took it in himself and he preached it well when he preached it I John took the book out of the hand of the one on this right here he didn't take the book out of the hand of this angel don't get quiet I just read it that's right I just read it that doesn't Bel little brother brandom it puts him in his perfect place that there's no way to hear it without him there's no way to take that book you got to know who to take it from there a lot of people got a lot of books listen Satan's got a book open too right and he's want to feed you out of that book also amen just as John was giving his message the same time that Messiah came in the day John knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him remember brother brandham the angel said just as John the Baptist forrun the first coming of Christ now remember I don't believe you'll ever find where he said you he said your message will forun the second coming of Christ right now I want you to understand clearly I'm not beling brother brandom he's got a place but we've got got to take the book we've got to take the book it's no use for us to look at this the the the Seven Seals messages and just say well that's all brother brandom well what are we going to what are we even doing here what are we doing here there's a part we got to play and that part is in the Book of Revelations amen thank God brother R said John was the top of the enti Bride oh we have never known that either amen John knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him and we realize that in the scripture over in Malachi 4 there's to be one like John and Elijah to whom the word of God can come to and he's to reveal by the holy spirit all the mysteries of God and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers now watch this read then we'll close musicians come on musician come on now watch real close now watch this is a prophet now he said this is something you must get everybody with me are you awake and paying attention this is something you must get now he had been doing his mediatorial work making intercession for the believer for 2,000 years he' been back there a lamb period right now brother R says now he's stepping forth from eternity to take the title deed book and to break the seals and reveal the Mysteries when of it at the end time do you get it all right we'll go on then now break the seals release the Mysteries to the seventh angel whose message is to reveal all the mysteries of God the mysteries of God lays in those Seven Seals that's what what he said here all the Mysteries lays in the seals and the lamb comes forth now from being a mediator between God and man he become a line and when he become a line he takes the book that's his rights God held it the mystery but now the lamb comes nobody could take the book it was still in the hands of God no Pope priest whatever it might be they can't take the book The Seven Seals hadn't been revealed but when the mediator when his work is done as an intercessory comes forth and jump the Elder said he's a line and he comes forth he heard the noise of a thunder this is the first seal and one of the Beast said now come and see in other words here stands the lamb and John standing out there watching it happen and the lamb comes up from the throne like he'd been slain blood all over him he was the one that was found worthy and when he reached over and took the book then everything began to shout and scream carrying on because they knew Redemption was paid for he continues on he talks about the White Horse He said all that sounds good cuz this is the teacher said that it was the Holy Ghost conquering in the first age but my revelation of it by the holy spirit is not that way my Revelation by the holy spirit is Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same person only in a different form so here stands Christ the lamb we know he was the lamb he's standing here with the books in his hand and there goes the white horse rider see it wasn't the Holy Spirit now that's one of the Mysteries of the last day how that Christ can be three persons in one it's not three different persons and he continues on and tells them talks to the people so now and how could Christ be out there on in other words with a white horse conquering and standing here with the book in his hand It Isn't So it isn't Christ notice the holy spirit in Revelation the holy spirit is Christ in another form notice it is a lamb that opened the book and the lamb is Christ and Christ has not seen anymore from then but he has seen in the Book of Revelations coming on a white horse we'll stop right there let's stand so what are we getting into we're getting in a transition to where absolutely there was a time when brother brandham preached the mighty conqueror was that white horse rider not knowing that it was the Devil Himself but when Christ come and said all right this is your job you got you're the one here to open these seals I'm going to show you in the Bible this is what you got to do and when he saw that that's why he said he said I don't know what the second seal is on the end of the second seal he said I don't know what that third seal is he had come to the conclusion that he was just going to wait on God and let God bring the truth to him and then you know what we don't go backwards from there we go forward we go forward in Revelation you can't go backwards in Revelation you got to go forward I want to ask you a question tonight do you know that lamb do you know that lamb do you know it's so sure that we'll read it later on where brother brandham says in another quote he says here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes the white horse rider here he was identifying the lamb was there cuz he said the lamb could only open the seals so brother Rand couldn't open them that's why he said I've never worked in this kind of Realm before why God was so close like he'd never been before and brother R knew that when he would look at that scripture and the angel would say something and he'd look and he'd say that was not what I was thinking so he knew right then that God was going to give him the perfect and divine interpretation of the word for who not the people sitting there cuz he's going to say that on the questions and answers it's for a group of people coming you and I are that group of people amen that this is all the fighting and fussing and arguing and all this this and that it's over this is the truth and that's it there's nothing else let's sing a song God bless you oh this is theing time it's later than you think the is now [Music] and all things are [Music] ready the [Music]

ailment anybody's ever had is in that sixth Dimension right now not one it never passed through and went into that sixth Dimension it stayed right here but I don't know about that Fifth Dimension weeping wailing nashing their teeth brother R said it had no it had no um Foundation you felt like you were falling what a horrible place to be but I'll promise you everything you say oh my brother died of this and my sister died of this and my you know that died of this it ain't over there prise Lord it ain't over there at all it stays right here so now what if we bring a little bit of that here it's going to shed off and L brother R said he said death going to come up your sleeve everybody I don't care who you are when you say death you have this little twinge of fear hello I don't care old or young we are we all have that one like today you know I'm like man you know is this is this going to be 50 blockages am I going to you know no I went in there and I said God there ain't a thing

but you you're the only one that can sustain my life now if we start believing it like that even when we have to go to the doctor and we don't feel good say God you're the sustainer you're the one that can and I told those doctors that were that were getting ready to work on brother Boyd I said you're not going to put these sales back together you're not going to you're not going to forge these sales back together you're going to put them close enough to where God can put them back together amen you can't there's no way way they've never done that before but God can do it and he does it all
