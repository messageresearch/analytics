Satan as lightning fall from heaven and behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy are nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I think the father and the old Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent it has to revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight amen Revelation chapter 12 and it says and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world and he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a great a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens that neither and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time Amen god bless you tonight you may be seated and don't take a look at something here from the message Satan's eatin and just want to start here brother Branham speaking in in Satan's Eden and he says now we will notice the earth when he took when God had it under control now when God had it under his control then then when Satan took over by rejecting the Word of God God one time had the earth under his control he said it in its orbit he put it make it work he done everything had it in his control and now we'll compare that with with that after Satan took in his control you know he took God six thousand years to establish that planet with good seats to bring forth everything after his kind everything must come forth of its kind all of his seeds were good and so it must bring forth after its kind God took six thousand years and he says and when it finally was made finally arrived with his headquarters of the earth in a beautiful spot Lang East of Eden called the Garden of Eden God made the world's headquarters in the Garden of Eden in Egypt right at the east end of the garden was the headquarters and then he says and over the whole situation he put his son and his son's wife over it that's right that's what God did he put them in full control they could speak to the winds and and which seeks to blow and they would speak to the trees and it and he would move from here to there and the wolf and the lion and the wolf fed together and the lamb laid down with them and there was no evil it was perfect peace perfect harmony everything in perfection and when God had it under his control and notice he had his world had all in operation he had everything coming everything eating bed Stacia nothing died nothing to be ruined nothing to be spoiled nothing it was just perfect and over at all he placed his beloved children his son and his daughter a husband and wife to control it God was so satisfied he rested from all his works at the seventh day and how the seventh day Sabbath for them because God looked over it all over and he had 6000 years and molding and fixing it out making it come into existence up to the mountains up making the volcanics push the mountains up and the things had taken place in the eruptions dried it off and fixed it the way he had at his beautiful place and there was nothing like it the great paradises of God the great dinosaurs and whatever more crawling through it I know the great animals no harm in them and they were just gentle as a little kitten and there was nothing no sickness no sorrow not one disease germ on the earth oh what a place the great birds sing swinging from tree to tree and Adam could call them by name and they would fly on his shoulders and COO to him oh what a wonderful place God had so you know I wanted to kind of a lengthy reading but I want to start there because you know when when we look at the plan of God you know had everything in perfection had it just the way he wanted it and you know brother Henry Greene had a statement he used to say all the time he said God started his church the way he wanted it he wants his church the way he started it and you know he said everything in perfection he said it just the way he wanted and you know every star and every molecule in the world is still following the law of God and you know you know you know when we look at things and and in the world today when how everything was put in place and you know there's God had a vision of what he wanted because it was his attributes that he expressed and when he put everything in in motion and he said in order the way he wanted he was absolute perfection because it was just exactly the way God had it in in his mind and today it still operates the same way you know the Sun doesn't have to wonder if it's going to come up in the morning the earth doesn't have to worry if it's going to rotate around you know we don't have to worry about any of these things why because there's a law of God we don't ever have to worry about are we gonna lose gravity and start floating in the air why because the laws of God are set in motion and we're still walking according to the laws of God so the thing is is I want to ask you a question tonight because and this is my whole point is if we are living if we get out of out of the bed and we know where feet are going to touch the floor and we're going to walk and we don't have to worry about floating in the air and we don't have to worry about having all of these things that you know light and all these other things that the Sun and the moon and all these different things in water you know all these things that have happened that God created and they still operate under the same laws that God set them in motion today do we have to worry about having the same things when we are children of God one because we are attributes of God so if the attributes of God are set in motion then you and I are set in motion and so the thing is is we cannot rely on that same power the same anointing that said all that emotion is upon you and I and so we don't have to worry about you know how these things are going to take place but because if we can just rely and realize what's inside of us then you know what we have overcome we have that overcoming power we have everything that we have need of inside of us and all we have to do is just rely on that you know brother Wade never has to go out and talk to the bees and ask them or you know y'all got to make honey and try to coax them into doing anything why because they they follow they have a nature of a bee and that be nature comes out and they go out and do everything and you know what you know how he knows that those bees are working that they do their thing was because he walks out there and he sees the evidence he sees the fruit of their labor well because that's who they are the honey is there and you know brothers and sisters we don't have to try to struggle and strive to be Christian we don't have to be struggling strong one because you know what it's all in our minds there's the problem but you know areas he said everything and the laws of God in motion everything was set in order and everything was perfect then you know what it's still the same laws of God and we know how Satan you know she become you know a little wishy-washy on the word you know she began to question God's authority what God had said you know she got that in her mind and we know how the fall took place and how everything came about but you know the thing is this God made a way that when when all of that took place that was a way back there was a way back that we don't you know because in the fall and we still live in that fallen condition but yet there's a way back that back that's been made you know the wicked that we have we have the overcoming power that we can come back and be where we need to be exactly the way God wanted us to be many people many people are looking back and you know because we look and what God has said what God put in in place well you know the laws of God never changed it and the thing is is there's nothing that's ever happened in the world even the fall didn't take God by surprise you know there's there's nothing that's ever come against him that's ever hindered him that's that's ever you know shocked him that stumbled him well you know what brothers and sisters if we are the same nature we're under the same power then why with a wife who do we allow things to stumble us why do we allow things to beset us why don't we allow things to hinder us why because we've been given this power if we if we look here Jesus says what you know because he says I saw Satan fall from heaven you know and in Revelation talks about you know him being kicked out you know he was defeated a long time ago when he decided you know I'm going to raise myself up and I'm gonna be like the Most High and you know I'm going to I'm going to draw a third of the angels to myself and I'm going to be like the Most High but he wasn't going to be the most high because he never could that's reason he said I'm gonna be like the Most High but he I'm going to be this way and he's animal raised up and he wanted to go contrary to God's Word and everything you tried to do so all he could do was just try to hinder the work of God and you know but you know even from the beginning when he sold it wouldn't him and Michael fought in heaven and you know he was casted out you know he was already defeated and you know he says that he was a defeated foe and yet he's still causing problems and you know what people are still listening to him and still people are still allowing him to work rev Rev said and Satan's Eden he said he said he had 6,000 years to God you spent 6,000 years to create a perfect eatin a great garden that he'd that he put man over he put man in charge of he gave him control of everything and you know he had dominion over it he had dominion and yet when he fell away you know what God didn't do away with him God made a way back because he knew that he would fall him brought him back and who was trying to be trying to bring him back the sons of God back to the place where they are where they always should have been it'll break me up I feel like I gotta throw broke another open but but you know here it is well we have this all of 6,000 years that God said everything in order and and just to prove to Satan you know he's allowed Satan to have 6,000 years to do the exact opposite of what God done he spent six thousand years trying to pervert exactly what God created because in a perfect Eden and a perfect atmosphere having perfect power over everything even fail but just believing the word and and Adam walked away walked away from from his position and then everything failed and it's been in this in this condition and and Satan's had a free reign over everything for 6,000 years but you know he said he said in 6,000 years Satan's tried to take over everything and hinder everything and make it just the perfect way but you know in all of these 6,000 years and all that he's tried to do and all that he's done and and all of that has that has been this perfect Satan's Eden you know the one thing is they still can't get the bride to fall you know even even in all the myths why because Eve fell in a perfect condition but you know what here we are in an imperfect condition wait it's ever you know every gun every every weapon every every spirit every demon and all of hail is against the bride he's against the truth but your brother Brad said he said he's going to prove to Satan that this egg will be like the first Eve this this Eve will stand on the word we will stand why because we have the overcoming power you know you know if you have if you have the life of God in you you know that's the reason it's so important to have the new birth to be born again but your thing is if you if you're born again you know to realize who you are you know I was at Sunday morning we were at brother Josh Bennet's Church and brother Richie was preaching there and said Taylor everybody hello but you know there was some there were some people that I've known for many years and they go to church there went to church with him many years ago well you know the one brother he said he kept looking at me he was a song leader he was stand up the front we were in the back and he kept looking at me he kept trying to figure out who I was he kept saying you look familiar you look familiar well he's like some other folks you know they're fishing ain't great but when he walked out of the church he exactly knew who I was things so when he got in sight of me he knew exactly who I was but he was talking to this other brothers know me for a long time and this other brother and he said well I knew exactly who he was I think I got close enough to see him because he looks like he's dead he said you can't deny who he is and the other brother says well you know if you look at him he said you can't deny who he is he said but the other brother said if you just talk to him just for a few minutes you'll know who he is you know I didn't have to do that I was born I was born a Roberts good bad or indifferent that's who I am I can't change that but you know what I don't have to get up in the morning and try to comb my hair and have this great hairstyle why because it just happened I got a really wide part but you know I didn't have to do that I don't have to get up in the morning and practice how I talk I don't have to look a certain way this physique just happened I inherited it it did but you know what we're people look at me they know who my father is why because I have the genetics of my father and I manifest the genetics of my father well you know what is the same way with a child of God you know because if you have the genetic genetics of the child of God if you are God make manifest then you know what you don't have to struggle to be God to manifest God to be who God made you to be why because it's inside of you one because it's just like Jeremiah said it's like fire shut up in my bones brother Branham said a child of God can't wait to get to church you know what a child of God reads the Bible a child of God prays we're gonna want and I can tell by looking at you I don't see any of you that's missed many meals that's right more of more than rest of you we went out to eat with brother Richie you the other morning and he just kept eating and eating and what I didn't eat I gave to him and he ate hey get put away food for sure laying is is you know what we do it's like if you're thirsty you know people sit around wish you had something I wish I knew what to do oh if somebody had some some idea what to do you know what you don't have that problem when you're when you're hungry I don't see people sitting around just complaining about it complaining about it complaining about it you know everybody everybody right now if you just say the word food everybody gets a thought in their mind they got some it's not the word food it's some food item is in your mind that's what you're thinking of there you go crab legs say as soon as you say the word food something comes into somebody's mind mine was chocolate brother brother brother Ritchie's mom sister Christine she's 93 years old that's all she lives owns chocolate she found out she found out years ago this lady lived over a hundred years old and they asked her what her secret of longevity was she said I eat a piece of chocolate every day sister Christine cut that out and put it on her wall she got a sign in her house it says don't let me fall in love let me fall in chocolate that's all she lives for chocolate 93 years old chocolate chocolate chocolate but let me tell you something you know I love all that you makes people like that here's here's a lady that all you you listen her her testimony all the things that's happened in her life you know what she's one of the happiest people in the whole wide world she got hardly anything but you know what she was praying one day and she said Lord I want a cabinet in my kitchen she said I had some dishes and stuff she said I wanted to like blue one and she's got pictures of it she'll show you she said I wanted this cabinet in my kitchen and she said she went to pray she went a thrift store and it was a light blue kitchen cabinet in the thrift store when she went in she said thank you Lord that's mine she wanted pillars to go on her couch and she's got pictures up she took a picture of them and put in an album and she went to a store and she found exactly what she was looking for and people and people think you know it's so hard it's so hard we got a struggling so I've know the Christian life is just as easy a life to live as any other kind of life but you know what we make it we allow the devil to talk us that is so hard to live a Christian life and everything is so hard and it's so difficult and it's so easy if we just rely realize what's on the inside of us and rely on that if we could just rely on on the life that's on the inside of us brother branham said that all that we had need of in this Christian journey was given to us in the new birth everything has been given to you you have been equipped for this journey for every bottle in every situation he said the only thing you've got to do is drink in and push out it's inside of you if you can realize that it's definitely on the inside of you you know it's such a great thing to understand to realize that we are who we are you know that we're children of God that we are God made manifest in flesh upon descending upon this earth you know it doesn't make us any any great person or any great thing but it's a it's a humbling experience to realize what God has done for you but you know what if we god has called us to this then when it's our it's our responsibility it's our responsibility to live the life that God called us to not to live below our privileges not not to live below what God has called us to God called us to a position for us to be fortified to be overcomers so we have to do what be what God has called us to be this is from crisis of mystery of God revealed brother brems says heavenly places oh I wish I had time here I've got it marked right here in the Bible about heavenly places what is heavenly places just for a moment the believers position in Christ see where the believer stands in Christ in heavenly places he says according as he has chosen us listen close listen chosen us in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when his great hidden mystery his great secret he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him and what love having what predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Christ Jesus to himself according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Christ Jesus predestinated the church to that great glorious stand so we are called to this and you know as a spoke one time before you know to understand you know this great mystery that God had and you know the you know all the way down through the Old Testament and everything you know God was unveiling it was revealing himself was unveiling himself but you know it was a secret to people it was it was a secret people didn't realize what was taking place and he said you know because if like I said a sacred is something people people say I got a sacred well you ain't got a secret anymore you got a mystery as soon as soon as you begin to speak of it it's not a secret anymore a secret is something that you don't know and you don't know anybody knows anything but as soon as you begin to speak because that's what the Old Testament prophets began to do they began to speak about it and that become the mystery a mystery for what he speaks about the mystery that he made through by non-base prophets so they become a mystery but see the mystery is what had to be revealed you know because if you had never if you had never seen just like I believe was Lewis and Clark on their expedition you know years ago they had a black man with him well the Indians as Lewis I believe it was Lewis and Clark on their expedition you know they were going the Indians had never seen a black man before and when they walked up there and they saw that black man they they were so amazed by him that they said they took this arm and kept looking at him they were amazed and they kept rubbing on his arm trying to get the black off of him they were so amazed to realize that that was a black man well you know the secret was that there was never they never saw by men so that was and that was a secret that was never nothing ever known about that but the mystery become when he when he become visible to them and if it came to be known and all of a sudden then there was something that was so shocking to them that this actually existed and then when they began to look and check this man out because they were so amazed by it then and then they became known to them and so that's the way it was in the old testament see when when Jesus came in flesh when he began to speak he went back to the Old Testament in total he said good do I not fulfil look he said he said if you can accuse me of sin look and say if I don't fulfill the Old Testament Scriptures he said because they speak of me he said he said is this not what what I've come to do they say there was a lot of scriptures that was that was spoke of and people just talked over and some doubted and you know they had all these different different ideas about things how it was going to take place and when it become to take place they didn't recognize it why because it didn't come the way they expected it to but when he stepped out there he began to speak and then he kept telling them this is this is the fulfillment of those scriptures and you and I we're the same way we're the fulfillment of Scripture many times people you know brother Branham said one time he said well abroad haven't have a ministry in the last days they said yes they said it consists of apostles and prophets and evangelists pastors and teachers they said it's going on right now this is this is this is the bride's ministry but everybody thinks well you know what well what is its hands off because you know unless you're the fivefold ministry the bride don't have a ministry well we're just gonna put it on the 500 ministry there you go and then you got these people over here things like well you know what we stay away from the fivefold ministry we shy away from them but you know what every believer every person every member of the body of Christ has a ministry God didn't call you know as Paul talks about it the body you know there's there's a body and that has has a function you know you have your your body has a problem you know what your whole body knows about it I had to have a tooth removed a couple of weeks ago and they had no bone graft you know if somebody thought I got hit kind of fat cheap there but you know what I knew about it my whole body knew about it I had one tooth that bothered me but you know what it felt like my whole head sometimes and it bothers you know it bothers your whole body and you know it's the same way with you and I because you know we are where our body that we're a body ministry and people people say well you know what what can I do what can I do you know well I'm not I'm not a singer I'm not a song leader I'm not a preacher I'm not this I'm not that well you know the thing is is everybody has to find their position and you know the problem is as a lot of people they they question that but you know what they don't ever do they don't ever go to God and say what can I do they don't ever go to God and say Lord what is my job to do you know there's one thing as of this weekend and talking to a number of different people you know there's one thing if you can't do anything there's one thing I know all of you can do and brother Branham says we don't do enough of it and that's pray and you know and it's not just praying for our church but it's praying for the whole body of Christ because the whole body of Christ is needing prayer there's so many people that need prayer and you know the thing is we think we got to have money or we got to have talent or we got to have skills we got to have this or that you know what we need we need to set aside aside some time in our life just to get before God and pray and pray for God to do something in our lives and do something for somebody else you know many times if we get if we get out of our own way and quit thinking about all our problems and all the things that we have to deal with and start looking at what's doing something for somebody else then you know what we come to find out our problems ain't as big as everything else people said around it you know as brother Jewel Forney I got to see brother jewel Sunday afternoon you know wowsie wowsie whoo you know well all you're so bad so poor so pathetic you know sometimes you get around people and come to find out you know people are rejoicing and you know they're up and going and you know what you can do you don't even realize the battles that they're fighting and you know what they they got a spring in their step they got a joy in their heart they got a song they got everything and you know what in some people they've got some little some little problem and they're all the way down and it can't get up and you know they got all kinds of problems you know there's people you know they're climbing up mountains and you know what they're singing the victory song and they ain't got one kind of problem they ain't got one little you know a thing is standing in their way and some people they can't get over anthills they got all kind of little problems like him like sign said takes 90 gallons of water to baptize a person takes one drop of rain to keep them out of church [Music] you know people all you know some people they got they got to try to find excuses or some kind of thing they let everything well you know what you start looking at people in the scripture you know you know one thing that we're supposed to do is keep our eye on the word and you start looking at the people all the things that they went through in the Bible well we don't know you know because I wake up in the morning there sometimes sometimes when I'm on the roof and I'm working all day I feel like I've been in a furnace but you know what they were three boys actually got thrown in a fire ain't never been thrown in a fire but sometimes I feel like it but you know what we you know they went in and said you know our God's more than able and if we if we get killed he throws us in and we know you know we still won't bow we're still going to hold to the Word of God and we think about all the different problems that we have why because we don't have the necessarily the pressures and the things that they have but why because well we just Satan's come along where is Satan's Eden Satan's Rock and everybody to sleep it's all easy it's all easy just smooth sailing you know it's all just so easy you know there's there's a man I believe with Stanford University his last name's fog doctor fog and I thought was really interesting his what his last name is some of y'all probably know about this you know he he was into what they call persuasive studies and you know persuasive studies and here's this whole lab that's dealing with all this type of technology and it's all about phones and computers and all this kind of stuff and you know it's how how they can use psychologists and neuroscientists and all this and their whole their whole job is to make the digital and social media your your just sucks you right in its where it's your prison you just get bound by this thing and you know people think well you know it's it's alright you know because here you here you got people that have children that you know that are 11 12 years old sometimes as young as six or eight years old and they got they get you know the first thing they get is a laptop a computer a tablet some kind of video game and they stay in that video game until they're 30 years old and when they get thirty years old they still they never accomplished nothing they can't do anything why because all they can do is live in that video world and live into that 3d and the virtual reality and they have no way can do it in the real world they can't function in the real world and that's what this man's his whole job was was technology on how to get people can addicted to this stuff and you know this this man was so good that when his students started Instagram and they got like some weird number like 800 million people on Instagram you know there's there's kids out there that that have a tablet and you know they they're all the time on their phone and you know you know they almost walk out into the street run into walls trip over stuff why because they can they can't get off of their phone they're like this all the time and you know some people they get up in the morning it's like we get a one I didn't I didn't get as many likes there's another person over here and I can't you know I don't know what I'm going to do because you know they got 800 likes on their picture and I didn't so I don't know if I won't be able to function today I don't even know if I'll be able to get out of bed you get somebody and it's like hey they got 895 and I got 915 and they're like woo they're up and going hey you know what I beat that person you know what they everybody say piling up gold in a virtual reality world thought you can't get a job but you know it just sucked some right in their whole life revolves around this and it's all about instant gratification and you know it is and it's like you know you people don't know how to function in the real world when you try to talk to them about Christ you know about having eternal life and everything and you know this like well you know I pulled up the salvation app here and it was a little green box right here in the red box right here and it says do you accept Jesus as your Savior and I click the green bug the green yes box I'm saved I'm looking for them I'm looking for the Holy Ghost where's the Holy Ghost step that's the third out but everybody just thinks that's the way it is we just there we go I got it and you know what people and people wonder why you know people people are so you're so bound by everything why because they have no way of functioning to the place that you know what you hold wrong until you get what you deserve what you're desiring because you know it doesn't matter if it takes one day he takes ten years it takes twenty years because if God said if he made a way for you to if his those the word says for you to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said for this promise is unto you and your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call well if it would take one day he takes three and a half years he takes 33 years you just hold on because he's obligated to give you the Holy Ghost but the people are people who people don't wanna wait people don't want to search and they don't want to seek no they just want to say I believe brother Branham to be a prophet and I got my by my belt buckle and I got my books on the shelf and I got my app on the phone here that says message on it but you know what it takes it takes a dine out it takes a death and it takes your death to dine to your own thoughts your own feelings your own circumstances everything and looking right to the Word of God and taking what he says we don't want to get on the altar of God we don't want God to kill us why because we want a little bit of ourselves still alone you know the thing is if people want to looking because you know God can never bless a ministry if you got somebody that has a little bit too much of themselves in it who wasn't Spurgeon or whoever said you know God never turns you away empty unless you're full of yourself you know the thing is you got to be completely empty of yourself many people may brother I'm said what gets of what get some ministries what get ministers he said money women a popularity why because it's them getting in then in the way of God's work he said you've got to be humble you know what amazes me is when brother Branham said the angel of the Lord you know here he is he's he's fasting he's praying he's spending hours praying for people he's praying all night long people come to his house and he has prayer meeting at his house he said you know he tries to get us a little bit of sleep he goes away tries to hunt and fish and get a little break and you know what even then he's got brothers that are coming to him and he still seeing visions and he's still telling them things and he's going oh leagues and God still talking to him and tell me about things that need to be taken care of and things to take to do later an angel the Lord tells and said you need to be more sincere I read that all the time and you know what it blows my mind Lord I don't know how much more sincere II can you get but you know what brother Branham never brother brother never questioned the angel of God on this I hadn't found one place where he said what am I supposed to do have y'all ever found that if somebody does y'all show it to him but every single time I've ever seen where brother Brennan brings that up he says Lord let me be more humble let me be more sincere I don't know how much more sincere you can get but you know you know you has that mentality Lord just let me be more like you it boggles my mind and that's the way you and I we ought to be but let us be more sincere Lord let us be more like you let us be what we need to be because we have to be what he has us he wants us to be praise the Lord I got away from my notes on amen praise the Lord you know because you know me times we you get up here and you think well I'm oh I'm gonna say this and I want to say that you write everything down all of a sudden the Lord comes and you start talking about other things it's like well I don't we just skip all that you know but you I want to be what he wants me to be because you know I have you know because if we have the overcoming power and you know that's the biggest hindrance that I that Aaron Roberts has is Erin Roberts and I got more than a lot of other y'all God but you know I have the overcoming power to overcome we have the overcoming power to overcome to be what God has called us to be can we overcome God has made us and given us a pathway to overcome brother Brown says here he says it's by one spirit he said we're all baptized into one body in the domain of that kingdom one spirit speech or baptism no matter how good how bad whatever we're in the kingdom by Holy Ghost baptism see that's the only way you overcome it's all that is under the shed blood is overcomers cause you cannot overcome yourself it's he that overcome for you says you're resting how well I know them brother Brent them when I'm in there watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it's just lived out of you automatically or if you have to strain and pull see then you're not doing it but you don't try to do it did you ever try yeah I don't he said in the days of Daniels time there were four over comers that could stand the test of fire and lion now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he that cometh to God must first be tested tested what with the word that's God's test do you believe they see do you believe it concretions amen he that cometh to God must be tested that only shows a true child then see be tested and when the test comes on you can't overcome less there's a test give to you when the when test is given it's it's to see whether you can overcome or not jesus said to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that can that ever happen to you I believe it's written in the scripture Peter said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing Thomas one good evidence to us that God is with us when we're tested for all children of God are tested and tried Jesus told us he said Jesus told us how to do it he overcome things however overcome means to stand the test that's right like all the old Saints did like Jesus did a midst of all his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood against he said in the very the very face of sickness and him being Messiah He healed them in the face of death he brought him back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated by surrendering himself why by the word said you destroy the temple and I'll raise it up in three days the word said so see in the presence of death he defeated he overcome death in the presence of Haley defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the grave he overcome the grave whoa all by the word and humility oh my there's the real man there's the one to make your example see he defeated everything overcome it look temptation was for him you know what the Bible said he was tempted in all points like a man like we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet he they you couldn't put a mark on him yes sir overcome means to recognize the devil and everyone is tricks a lot of people say there is no devil it's just the thought don't you believe that there's a real devil and he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time you must recognize him and know that he is a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the God in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by His grace you are more than a match for him amen that's real overcoming when you recognize Amen God called us to give us overcoming power and he called us to recognize all of the powers of the enemy and they called us to overcome and you know I want to share one little one little thought with you I was reading the other night and I thought it was so good I put it in I put in my notes you know brother Ron was speaking on demonology he's talking to makes it if you know what a devil is he said the English word for a devil as a tormentor he said he come to torment you hey come he come to bring problems and oppose you and everything he come against you with and you know and that's what he come to do is to torment you and you wonder what did the what did the devil's come when they spoke to Jesus when Jesus come what did they say what did you come to torment me he come to torment you but you know what Jesus come they said the same thing so why did you come to torment us you know what because they were brother Ram said when a devil is subject to you he said he knows it he recognizes the power of God when when Jesus spoke to the disciples and Matthew 16 he said who do men say that I the Son of Man em they said well you're Elijah one of the prophets you know one of some some one of them whoever Jeremiah Ezekiel whoever but then Jesus said but who do you say that I am and Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and he said blessed art thou simon barjona and for flesh and blood didn't reveal that to you but my father in heaven and he said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it you know when if you look up the word gates I was reading I was reading this commentary they talk about you know the the gates you know does anybody really know what the what the word gates in that in that in the English translation meant it means a pathway it means a channel just like a gate goes through a fence you have to have a pathway and that's what a gate was forward it was a channel that was pushed that was there and he said and that that gate that pathway and you know there's there's many different ways of translating that but most of the time we think of gates as the power the authority the strength of Hale can't prevail against you but it also means a channel or a pathway well then you know what there's no pathway there's no way that the devil has tuned you oh you've got it he's got a punch coming to you he's got a way to get to you he can get through you and your five senses but according to the scripture there's not a pathway that he takes against you that he can prevail over you it also means that a gate one of the one of the translations for that also means is something that hinders you well you know you put up a gate you can't get in you can't you can't go fer any further than where the gate is you reach a pathway there's a gate there you know what there's no other way to go there's a gate there so the gates of Hell will stop you but he said he said the gates of Hell can't stop you it can't prevail it can't stop your path and the other way of translating that means a boundary if they put you in prison how do you get in do a gate so you know what the gates of hell can't prevail against you so whatever he tries to bind you with whatever you whatever the devil comes and puts on you that you're bound by then you know what he come to make the captives free so you know what the gates of hell can't bind you they can't oppose you they can't hinder you why because he said the the revelation of the word came to defeat all the powers of the enemy the gates of Hell cannot prevail against you that's what I believe that's what I asked that is my confession that the gates of hell can't stop me Amen god bless you tonight let's all stand I'm gonna sing I want to sing another little song I don't think we've sung this in a while but listen come to me earlier today I think it's in
