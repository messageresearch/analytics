[31:08] trinitarians we know that brother
[31:10] brandham was not a trinitarian but
[31:12] neither was he a denominational
[31:16] Oneness right he had the correct
[31:19] understanding we had better believe it
[31:22] if not we better find us somebody else
[31:24] to follow but I believe he had the
[31:27] correct understanding as it's in your
[31:29] notes Dar that he said on the conduct
[31:33] order and Doctrine message that we have
[31:36] the uh perfect
[31:38] interpretation by Divine Vindication all
[31:42] right now uh if we don't believe that we
[31:45] certainly better get up and go somewhere
[31:47] else and try to find something because I
[31:50] believe that we're running out of time
[31:53] all right but now
[31:58] what I want us to think about
[32:00] is the message that we preached prior to
[32:03] this and we we've had to miss some
[32:06] Services because of weather and things
[32:08] like that but you know that's that's the
[32:10] Lord's doings not mine and uh but the
[32:14] last message I was trying to get you to
[32:17] see just one
[32:19] point the prophet said hold up a point
[32:21] until the people see it and then move on
[32:24] and uh but what was we talking about
[32:27] that God is
[32:30] unchangeable Malachi 3 he says I'm
[32:34] God and I change not right therefore the
[32:38] sons of Jacob can be preserved in other
[32:42] words we have a hope why would it say
[32:45] talk about Jacob there see we have a
[32:48] hope because Jacob is relating to the
[32:52] flesh man you know Israel was the
[32:56] spiritual man
[32:58] and the the sons then of Jacob could
[33:01] have an
[33:02] opportunity and you and I can have an
[33:05] opportunity but you see if God does
[33:08] something one
[33:10] way now your Prophet said over and over
[33:15] he's got to do it
[33:17] again the same way because he can't
[33:21] change amen you say well it looks like
[33:24] it well I don't care what it looks like
[33:27] uh I don't care what it looks like you
[33:30] got to believe the Bible and where he
[33:32] said I'm God and I changed not and you
[33:34] got to believe the prophet's message and
[33:36] forget your ideas one brother one time
[33:38] said he had a bunch of questions written
[33:40] out about marriage and divorce and said
[33:43] I wanted to ask brother brandham these
[33:46] questions you know and said one day the
[33:49] Lord spoke to him and said are you going
[33:51] to believe what my Prophet said are you
[33:54] going to believe what you used to
[33:56] believe that's right
[33:58] that solved that problem didn't it you
[34:00] know so then you know if God ever healed
[34:05] anybody see that's all we put it on we
[34:07] we put that when brother R said God is
[34:09] unchangeable we put it on the basis of
[34:11] if God ever healed anybody and the same
[34:14] person receive that same Faith he's got
[34:15] to be healed uh if God ever saved one
[34:18] person you know he's he's got to save
[34:20] the next one if they reach the same
[34:21] position but see I I look at it like
[34:24] this if we're going to believe that God
[34:26] is real M then he cannot change his mind
[34:30] he could never have a second thought
[34:32] about the way to do anything his first
[34:35] thought would have to be pure and
[34:38] original and and and you can't change it
[34:41] so the way he would do anything now this
[34:43] is a
[34:44] background for Wednesday
[34:47] night because I believe I mean Friday
[34:51] night I believe that uh Revelations 1
[34:55] shows you the key to
[34:58] understand how the Bible is
[35:02] written and see then I believe like Wade
[35:05] was covering it see on the the services
[35:07] the other day because he had caught
[35:09] something I was talking about on it and
[35:12] he put it into his message cuz he's kind
[35:13] of like me when he gets something he
[35:15] can't keep it he has to go ahead and
[35:17] tell you cuz I don't keep anything I
[35:19] don't have uh things written in my
[35:22] secret notes to be able to preach 20
[35:24] years from now I just go day by day and
[35:27] you know kind of take it as I get it but
[35:30] see we look at Genesis 1 and compare
[35:34] that with Revelations one and you can
[35:37] see that God don't change that's right
[35:40] all right but see you can't read into
[35:43] Genesis
[35:45] one the way of looking at it the way you
[35:49] can read in in Revelations 1 right amen
[35:52] but just remember if he done it one way
[35:55] in Genesis he must do it that way in
[35:57] Revelation or if he done it that way in
[35:59] the Book of Revelation he must do it
[36:03] must have done it all the way down cuz
[36:06] the only way he he's trying to reveal
[36:09] himself now and in doing that see we see
[36:13] the order of how he reveals
[36:16] himself in Revelations 1 what does it
[36:19] say and we've been over this and over it
[36:23] sure does sound like trinitarianism
[36:25] don't it says the revelation
[36:28] of Jesus
[36:30] Christ which God gave unto him
[36:35] y now however what this was God gave it
[36:38] under Jesus Christ
[36:42] right I sound like trinitarianism
[36:44] doesn't
[36:46] it they mean that doesn't confuse your
[36:50] mind that doesn't make you wonder what's
[36:53] going on that's right but to me it's the
[36:55] most beautiful thing
[36:58] are the way of understanding how God
[37:00] does write the Bible
[37:03] amen right right now remember this
[37:07] point it doesn't say here that it's the
[37:11] revelation of
[37:13] Jesus that's amen that God gave unto his
[37:18] Angel to signify him through his Angel
[37:20] and servant John it doesn't say that if
[37:23] it did then we'd be Oneness right amen
[37:28] or we need to be
[37:30] trendy but by the way that it says it it
[37:34] put it
[37:35] perfectly to where that you can
[37:37] understand the Bible amen the Bible is
[37:40] not to reveal Jesus amen oh no wa a
[37:44] minut
[37:45] brother now listen amen it's to reveal
[37:50] Jesus Christ amen that's
[37:53] right and Jesus Christ is almighty God
[37:56] Amen all right now I gave you some
[38:00] quotes in there we'll get to it in a
[38:01] minute
[38:03] maybe we just go ahead and down cover
[38:09] it it's the one that doesn't have any
[38:12] writings on it you know numbers on it
[38:16] okay you start off at the top on future
[38:19] home I didn't meend to bring these but I
[38:22] figured I'd better bring it on and and
[38:24] put it out because it's like brother
[38:26] Keith Reed said one time to me and I've
[38:28] tried to do that ever since he said
[38:30] brother Dale your people know what
[38:32] you're talking about but said people on
[38:34] the Airways that are hearing a lot of
[38:36] times they don't know what you're saying
[38:38] because they have not had the background
[38:41] to to understand all right so I just try
[38:43] to give it to you what the prophet said
[38:45] amen that's right so in that way I don't
[38:47] have to worry about it you know because
[38:50] your Prophet said If you're looking at
[38:52] it in the future home page 10 the Bible
[38:56] is the complete
[38:58] revelation of Jesus Christ right
[39:02] amen now he doesn't say it's a
[39:04] revelation of Jesus right
[39:07] amen neither does he just say it's a
[39:09] revelation of Christ now you may find
[39:12] those quotes right but just remember
[39:15] what he's saying it's the
[39:17] revelation of Jesus Christ he said there
[39:20] is his body Christ revealed his own word
[39:23] 65 8:22 he said so the Bible is the
[39:26] complete revelation of Jesus Christ and
[39:30] it was wrote by prophets Hebrews 1 and
[39:33] let get what I underline and you read
[39:35] all between if it doesn't match up cuz
[39:37] he said Jesus Mali Jesus was Jeremiah
[39:39] Jesus
[39:40] forah it's not a book of simp
[39:44] systems a c code of moral ethics neither
[39:48] is it a history book right or a book of
[39:51] theology now he's telling the Bible is
[39:53] not these things it is not but it's a
[39:55] revelation of Jesus Christ Christ God
[39:58] revealed himself from word to flesh and
[40:03] that's what it is the Bible is the word
[40:05] and God is the flesh now it corrects
[40:06] it's a what God in God is the word
[40:09] rather and Jesus being the flesh it's a
[40:12] revelation how God the word was
[40:16] manifested in human flesh and revealed
[40:19] to us and that's why he becomes a Son of
[40:22] God he is a part of God he said you
[40:25] understand
[40:28] H so look what he's saying going down in
[40:31] Christ revealed in his own word
[40:33] paragraph 6 56 and said uh talking about
[40:37] the preaching of the same Paul and Peter
[40:39] meeting they were preaching the same he
[40:42] said that's our Bible in other words
[40:43] they were preaching the same word thing
[40:45] word by word that's our Bible let other
[40:48] man's words fail this no man can add to
[40:51] it you remember if you add to the book
[40:53] or take away what the problem is you add
[40:55] to the revelation of the book you take
[40:57] away from the revelation of the book
[40:59] what have you
[41:00] got oh the way it is now the great
[41:02] things that open the seventh seal is
[41:04] revealed to me and I just make it what I
[41:06] want
[41:07] it well that's you you face that with
[41:10] God CU that's you know I'm going to face
[41:13] him what I say right all right but look
[41:16] what he
[41:18] said that's our Bible let other men's
[41:20] words fail there no man can add to it
[41:24] you don't add no more to the Bible no
[41:26] sir this is a complete Revelation that's
[41:30] all all right
[41:32] now I just gave you the one there of uh
[41:37] 105 paragraph 105 questions and answers
[41:40] where brother Brown said we have the
[41:41] perfect interpretation of the word of
[41:44] God with Divine vind
[41:46] Vindication then that which is in part
[41:49] is done away with when I was a child I
[41:51] spake as a child I understood as a child
[41:53] when I become a man I put away childish
[41:55] thing see and I go to preaching and
[41:58] don't get these now remember that in a
[42:00] minute we'll come back to that okay now
[42:03] flip it
[42:07] over and think about what your Prophet
[42:09] is
[42:12] saying think about what is saying to you
[42:15] there because the title of the message
[42:17] tonight will be as I said it's a words
[42:20] of this prophecy number
[42:22] 10 and the title is time to understand
[42:28] I think it's time to understand folks if
[42:31] it's not I don't know when it will
[42:33] be and I tell you what we don't have 40
[42:36] more years because that would make me
[42:39] 110 and you know what that' make a lot
[42:41] of
[42:42] y'all older than
[42:47] that right so we better consider that
[42:51] you right now brother Al he can Crow
[42:53] because he's following me he won't I he
[42:56] calls sir until he did till September
[43:00] then he was all right he caught up with
[43:03] me but now
[43:05] listen the
[43:08] Revelation that God gave to
[43:14] Jesus all right to give it to John he
[43:17] said signified it you know made it plain
[43:20] or understood to the
[43:23] angel now you know there was evidently
[43:25] something Jesus didn't know
[43:32] right
[43:35] see now if you was a Oneness you'd be
[43:37] jumping down my throat yeah because
[43:40] you'd be saying now wait a minute
[43:42] he Jesus was almighty
[43:47] God I agree with you
[43:51] amen but you
[43:54] see we put him as and this is for Friday
[43:57] night really good we limit got Jesus to
[44:01] not knowing all things because that he
[44:04] was in human
[44:06] flesh that's a good point that'll hold
[44:09] you for a while but that's not the
[44:15] Bible don't you remember years ago and
[44:17] most of you got mad at me about it you
[44:19] probably still are because I exposed it
[44:23] I asked you a simple question one
[44:26] day and that's been about 20 something
[44:28] years ago and I ask a simple question I
[44:31] said we were ask back when the son of
[44:33] man was being preached and everybody was
[44:35] preaching son of man son of man and I
[44:37] asked you I said when is the first time
[44:40] in
[44:41] your mind if I say son of
[44:45] God when did you when did you lock in
[44:48] that the Son of God came in to
[44:51] be and I gave everybody an opportunity
[44:53] to get up and say they didn't do it
[44:57] so then I told you then everybody here
[44:59] had the same
[45:02] thought see of course now you wouldn't
[45:04] agree with it but that's all
[45:07] right see Son of God was the word or
[45:11] logos that went out of God in the
[45:12] beginning
[45:16] am well you're a
[45:20] trinitarian well let's see if it'll fit
[45:24] the Bible
[45:28] see most people think Son of God was
[45:30] 2,000 years ago on the shores of Galilee
[45:32] but you better remember even the three
[45:34] Hebrew children when the man looked down
[45:36] in there he said one liken the Son of
[45:38] God right amen your Scholars knew and
[45:42] brother brandham covered it over and
[45:43] over that the logos the theophany the
[45:47] word that went out of God was the son of
[45:49] God he said God gave birth to his first
[45:52] son right or to himself as a son right
[45:58] either way you want to State it we see
[46:00] we say well now brother Dale what you do
[46:02] is you just confuse us we thought we had
[46:05] it figured
[46:07] out no I didn't confuse
[46:11] you if what I'm saying makes you think
[46:15] you're confused then remember you was
[46:16] already confused I just exposed it right
[46:20] see people don't like me because of that
[46:23] but that's the only way I can save your
[46:24] soul so if you get mad at this body go
[46:26] ahead
[46:28] but if your soul is saved on the day
[46:30] that I'm there and meet you I'll be
[46:32] tickled to death and there won't be no
[46:35] problems cuz you see I got to look back
[46:37] at the word
[46:39] amen and see what the word says read
[46:43] what your Prophet
[46:45] said when he was talking about that
[46:46] little Halo of light question go to gen
[46:50] to uh cont ordering Doctrine book
[46:54] one and just start reading and you'll
[46:56] get about page 21 and you'll see what
[46:58] I'm talking about that the logos was the
[47:01] theophany the Son of
[47:04] God that's why that when Peter looked at
[47:08] Jesus and Jesus said who the man say I
[47:10] the son of man am Peter didn't say you
[47:13] are a son of man he said Thou Art the
[47:15] Christ the son of the Living
[47:18] God you're the creator of God because
[47:21] Christ was the creator of God Amen Jesus
[47:23] was the creator of God right am
[47:26] but you see we get all tied up in our
[47:29] thoughts and think we Haven it figured
[47:30] out of one God and when we do we wind up
[47:33] to see how confused we
[47:35] are cuz the Bible said the Revelation
[47:38] that God gave to Jesus to give to
[47:42] John well it's evident that Jesus didn't
[47:46] understand so well I just don't I don't
[47:49] understand that
[47:50] well pray
[47:54] right because confusion sure don't help
[47:57] us right and brother Rand said it like
[48:00] this bring me a question on it bring it
[48:02] to me you know this Friday night the
[48:05] prophet said questions makes a strong
[48:07] church amen that's right cuz one thing
[48:09] it means you're thinking
[48:12] right another thing that means that God
[48:15] can give us the answer cuz he's always
[48:17] got the answer that's
[48:18] right I don't have them I I told you
[48:21] about that I just know somebody that
[48:23] does haveen but see you say well well I
[48:26] don't
[48:30] understand it it it says the
[48:32] revelation of Jesus
[48:39] Christ that God gave unto him who to
[48:44] Jesus Christ
[48:46] amen it's not the revelation of Jesus
[48:49] Christ that God gave unto
[48:51] John that's true we know it but this was
[48:54] what God gave unto Jesus Christ for
[48:57] Jesus Christ to come personally brother
[48:58] R said page 13 Church AG book The Only
[49:01] book in the Bible whereas that Jesus
[49:03] coming personally to
[49:05] ascribe
[49:07] amen all right see it's a time to
[49:12] understand but look what he says in
[49:14] Revelations chapter uh
[49:17] 1 you got on your notes there which is
[49:19] 1960 1204 the morning
[49:23] service when our Lord was on Earth the
[49:25] disciples asked him and said Master will
[49:28] you at this time restore the kingdom
[49:30] back to Israel now watch what I'm
[49:37] saying they ask him in another time
[49:41] right when are you going to
[49:45] come and he says I don't
[49:49] know only the father knows that's that
[49:53] scripture now the prophet is using
[49:56] another
[49:57] scripture the scripture of
[50:01] what at this time restore will you at
[50:04] this time restore the kingdom back to
[50:05] Israel and Jesus said it's not for you
[50:08] to know this hour or time and no one
[50:12] would know said even the son as yet did
[50:15] not
[50:17] know but after his death burial and
[50:20] resurrection and Ascension into Glory he
[50:23] receives from God the future of the
[50:25] church then he turned back to bring this
[50:28] message to the church and the message of
[50:30] his coming and the condition of the
[50:33] church down through the age right he
[50:35] could not do it before his death burial
[50:39] and Resurrection because he had not yet
[50:42] knew
[50:44] it but did you notice how the scripture
[50:47] reads here the revelation of Jesus
[50:50] Christ which God gave unto him now
[50:52] listen to
[50:55] it how that God the
[50:58] Father gave the Revelation to his son
[51:01] Jesus Christ
[51:03] amen now that's what your Prophet is
[51:05] saying is he a
[51:09] trinitarian cuz see you make me one
[51:12] because I read
[51:14] it you know right you make me one cuz I
[51:19] can read what he
[51:21] said well why don't you make him one
[51:24] because you read what he said
[51:26] right how that God the Father gave the
[51:29] Revelation to his son Jesus Christ and
[51:31] he sent his Angel to John to signify
[51:34] these things which was which was which
[51:38] is and which shall be all it set
[51:42] beautifully now look at the next one
[51:45] page 14 Church age
[51:48] book these men were still thinking of
[51:51] Jesus having an Earthly Kingdom but it
[51:53] was a spiritual Kingdom that he was
[51:55] going to build even and he could not
[51:57] tell them about his place in it for the
[52:00] father had not yet revealed it unto him
[52:04] but after his death and resurrection and
[52:07] at this particular time in his
[52:09] mediatorial ministry he is able to set
[52:12] forth in this revelation of himself to
[52:14] John what his glory and presence in the
[52:17] church would mean and do right now
[52:19] that's what's your Propet
[52:24] said now the next about three are
[52:28] illustrating so let's read them
[52:30] illustrating what brother Brown is
[52:31] talking about e13 angel of the Lord
[52:35] preached 1951 7:18 when some Blind Men
[52:39] followed him he touched their eyes and
[52:43] said now listen to these things and
[52:45] you'll see what happened in the Bible
[52:49] right of course if you don't want to pay
[52:51] no attention to it that's your
[52:55] business what
[52:57] he touched their eyes now Jesus touched
[52:59] the
[53:00] eyes and said according to your faith be
[53:04] it unto you that was not the
[53:06] father
[53:12] right well let's just keep reading the
[53:15] father had not showed him nothing about
[53:18] that he just touched their
[53:22] eyes but when calling
[53:25] Lazarus never
[53:27] remember I can show you the quote where
[53:29] brother R said God had already showed
[53:31] him and showed him to keep going right
[53:33] to not turn around and come back
[53:37] y all but when calling Lazarus where he
[53:42] seen he said Lazarus come
[53:44] forth and to the other people who the
[53:47] father had who the father had showed him
[53:50] by vision and what he was to do he
[53:53] called them and so forth then when the
[53:55] others come
[53:56] by he touched them and said according to
[53:59] your
[54:00] faith all right now that is found in
[54:03] John 5:19 that the son can do nothing
[54:07] but what he seeth the father doing right
[54:10] Amen brother brandom said he never done
[54:13] nothing until he saw a
[54:16] vision right Jesus saw a
[54:20] vision well you sure do sound like
[54:22] you're trying to make two or three
[54:25] gods what are you doing that's an easy
[54:28] way to say it look at the next one do
[54:31] you now believe paragraph or E 11 which
[54:34] preached 1952
[54:36] 8:17 now Jesus done
[54:38] nothing now why didn't he heal that
[54:41] man or the Twisted man or the
[54:44] lame man or the halt man now why didn't
[54:47] he do it is because the father had not
[54:50] showed him is that right do you believe
[54:52] that's a reason and he only heal what
[54:55] the father showed him then if he said a
[54:58] little while in the world seeth me no
[55:00] more yet you'll see me no more for I'll
[55:02] be with you even in you to the end of
[55:03] the world is that right going down door
[55:06] of the door preach
[55:08] 57212 e45 Lazarus the resurrection all
[55:12] these things the father had showed him
[55:14] and there was a little woman coming to
[55:16] the audience and she did not the father
[55:19] had not showed her listen showed him
[55:22] nothing concerning her but she believed
[55:25] so she she went through the crowd and
[55:27] she touched His Garment and went out and
[55:29] sat down and Jesus turned and said now
[55:32] who has touched me Y and re Peter
[55:36] rebuked him said the Lord the whole
[55:37] crowd touched him why'd you say
[55:40] that but see there's a Doctrine
[55:43] now in the people of the message that
[55:46] says that you can't take what Jesus
[55:50] says you got to take what the father
[55:53] says oh yeah and sometimes Jesus was
[55:56] talking and sometimes the father was
[55:58] talking so we got to figure it out of
[56:00] course they're the only ones who knows
[56:03] which ones talking that's the reason
[56:06] they're saying it that way see they can
[56:09] divide between the
[56:12] two but
[56:15] uh we not make it this exactly what he
[56:18] said but get the point
[56:22] now God revealed unto Jesus Jesus
[56:28] Christ The Book of
[56:34] Revelation now Mark that down hold on it
[56:36] just a minute see
[56:39] because the Bible is not the revelation
[56:41] of
[56:43] Jesus but it's a revelation of Jesus
[56:46] Christ
[56:47] right now I've tried my best for about
[56:50] 20 well 30 years or more to tell you
[56:53] when I'm talking about Jesus I know how
[56:56] to say Jesus and mean flesh but when I
[56:59] say Jesus Christ I am not talking about
[57:02] the flesh now how many messages has that
[57:05] been on when I say Jesus Christ when the
[57:09] prophet says Jesus Christ when the Bible
[57:11] says Jesus Christ it is not talking
[57:13] about the 16 elements of the man right I
[57:18] do not believe that Jesus Christ in
[57:20] human flesh come to John on patas right
[57:27] why why did he come to him and say well
[57:30] he give it to the angel and well then
[57:32] Jesus is standing here and the angel is
[57:33] standing here and they standing there no
[57:35] I try to preach that to you over and
[57:39] over you better get that angel out of
[57:41] your
[57:43] way give him his rightful position like
[57:46] I told him while coming to church
[57:47] tonight there's no greater position than
[57:49] you could give brother brandom than for
[57:50] him to bring to bring the revelation of
[57:53] the entire Bible to you and I to where
[57:55] we can comprehend it there's nothing
[57:56] greater could be made that's right
[57:59] that's right but why is it in
[58:00] Revelations 1 that it never hardly even
[58:03] mentions it that angel it doesn't
[58:05] mention that angel is to him that angel
[58:07] is giving him and helping him do it but
[58:09] John's one's writing the Angel's not
[58:14] writing now we're going to get to it in
[58:16] a minute and let's see what you say
[58:17] about
[58:20] it cuz why was it that brother Ram's
[58:23] angel that was with him from birth could
[58:25] not tell him what the seals were that's
[58:30] right that's right come on he told him
[58:34] about serpent seed he told him about
[58:36] many
[58:38] things but he couldn't tell him about
[58:40] the
[58:44] seals he had to wait
[58:49] sure see we're going to get into
[58:51] something might be interesting
[58:56] notice now my
[58:59] point the entire Bible is the complete
[59:02] revelation of Jesus
[59:05] Christ not Jesus the Flesh and it is not
[59:09] the revelation of just the
[59:11] Christ
[59:14] right it is the revelation of Jesus
[59:16] Christ right
[59:20] amen and Jesus Christ is almighty God
[59:23] Amen
[59:26] yep or else you're going
[59:29] turn now the time to
[59:34] understand the time to
[59:37] understand now let's read a few notes
[59:40] number one on your notes Revelation
[59:42] chapter 1 1960 1204 the morning
[59:47] service he said now that now time is at
[59:49] hand what when the complete revelation
[59:53] of Jesus Christ has been made known to
[59:57] his churches amen and the ages go by
[1:00:01] it's just revealed to
[1:00:03] them now what is the time to
[1:00:08] understand when the Book of Revelations
[1:00:10] when the entire
[1:00:13] Bible the complete Revelation is
[1:00:16] revealed to man right of Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ as I said then I gave it to you a
[1:00:24] moment ago there conduct order and
[1:00:25] Doctrine where the Prophet said we
[1:00:28] have the perfect interpretation of the
[1:00:31] Bible with Divine Vindication
[1:00:35] right so there can't be anything else to
[1:00:37] be coming to be added or added
[1:00:39] Revelations or added things while we're
[1:00:41] here in this
[1:00:43] world now can be a messages here out to
[1:00:46] the endless ages but they can't be
[1:00:48] anymore added
[1:00:49] here right because it's the complete
[1:00:52] Revelation Revelations book of symbols
[1:00:54] 19566 17
[1:00:57] look you know he's reading down blessed
[1:01:00] the man reading today to hear the words
[1:01:01] of this prophecy and those and keep
[1:01:04] those things which are written there in
[1:01:05] for the time is at hand oh my if we just
[1:01:08] could go into it right now look when is
[1:01:11] the time at
[1:01:14] hand when is the time at
[1:01:18] hand when the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:22] has been revealed to the body of Christ
[1:01:25] I'm reading
[1:01:26] right watch and Christ has re been
[1:01:30] revealed not dead but alive living in
[1:01:33] his church doing the same things he did
[1:01:35] the same Ministry the same gospel the
[1:01:37] same sign the resurrected Christ when
[1:01:40] he's revealed by his Angel into the
[1:01:43] church then the time is at hand and
[1:01:47] never a time since that day until this
[1:01:49] has the mystery of Jesus Christ been
[1:01:52] revealed until these last few years then
[1:01:56] the time is at
[1:02:00] hand the
[1:02:02] time is at
[1:02:06] hand the time to
[1:02:10] understand and you ever thought about
[1:02:13] this I like to make you think sister Gil
[1:02:16] said brother they make you think about I
[1:02:17] like to make you
[1:02:20] think have you ever thought about
[1:02:22] it what if the Book of Revelations had
[1:02:25] never been written now I know that's
[1:02:27] okay we are okay come come you know it
[1:02:31] didn't
[1:02:32] happen but what if it
[1:02:37] happen what is the Book of Revelation
[1:02:40] that have never been
[1:02:42] written now you'll see this is tying
[1:02:44] together to what I'm trying to say
[1:02:46] because if the Book of Revelations had
[1:02:48] never been revealed it don't make no
[1:02:51] difference how long it has been written
[1:02:53] that's right it is no good unless it is
[1:02:56] revealed right amen but think about it a
[1:02:59] minute what kind of a Bible would you
[1:03:02] have without the Book of
[1:03:05] Revelation right you know what you would
[1:03:10] have you would have the revelation of
[1:03:13] one
[1:03:18] God you have the revelation of
[1:03:22] redemption for the soul right
[1:03:26] but you would not have the Revelation or
[1:03:28] the writing of redemption for the body I
[1:03:31] want you to show me
[1:03:34] that yeah but Paul said you that's right
[1:03:37] Paul
[1:03:40] prophesied now remember this is the
[1:03:42] words of this prophecy there's a lot of
[1:03:44] difference between prophesy or
[1:03:47] prophesying and
[1:03:50] prophecy prophecy is the bringing
[1:03:53] together of the entire word of God and
[1:03:55] reveal it to
[1:03:56] prophecy is somebody
[1:04:00] speaking all
[1:04:01] right now so you would have Paul and all
[1:04:05] he said about the change but where was
[1:04:07] anybody change that's right
[1:04:14] right you would have great things don't
[1:04:17] misunderstand
[1:04:19] me you would have great
[1:04:22] things but you would not have the
[1:04:24] complete Plan of Redemption
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:28] amen you would only have the point of
[1:04:33] Salvation you would have uh as much as
[1:04:37] to Philip to be translated for 300
[1:04:41] miles you know youd have great things
[1:04:45] that you could speak
[1:04:47] of but it is in the Old Testament were
[1:04:50] that those men like Enoch was not
[1:04:53] because God took him
[1:04:59] Elijah was taken up in a
[1:05:02] chariot the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:05:04] only one in the New Testament that was
[1:05:07] taken
[1:05:09] up right
[1:05:12] right see you would not have the
[1:05:14] complete Plan of Redemption you say well
[1:05:16] I don't know about that now I tell you
[1:05:18] what well all right you preach it to me
[1:05:20] I'll give you the pull pit we got
[1:05:21] tomorrow night you want it I'm not
[1:05:23] joking and I'm not sarcastic
[1:05:26] I wish you'd give me that opportunity to
[1:05:28] be able to speak and to speak plain
[1:05:31] enough brother BR said if you don't make
[1:05:33] it plain people are think you're trying
[1:05:34] to pull something over on
[1:05:36] them right that's one thing for sure I
[1:05:39] don't want you to think about me is I'm
[1:05:41] trying to pull something over on you
[1:05:43] that's right what I needed I got all I
[1:05:48] need I don't need anything
[1:05:51] else what good would it do in this day
[1:05:56] but do you see what I'm talking about
[1:05:59] when you have the perfect
[1:06:01] interpretation by Divine Vindication of
[1:06:04] the message of the hour to understand
[1:06:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ the time
[1:06:11] is at hand right that's
[1:06:13] right the time to understand the time to
[1:06:18] walk
[1:06:19] off and then what did we do when we took
[1:06:22] the Book of Revelations in chapter 1
[1:06:25] that immediate the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:26] comes on the scene to John and
[1:06:29] immediately he takes him and immediately
[1:06:31] he's taken to the place and position of
[1:06:33] even the white Throne right cuz that's
[1:06:36] where he's at when he fell down there at
[1:06:38] his feet in Revelations 1 cuz he sees
[1:06:41] the bride one standing in the midst of
[1:06:43] the seven golden candlesticks right G
[1:06:46] about the path that's femin we've been
[1:06:48] over it and over it why we're not a
[1:06:50] denomination brother R says he saw the
[1:06:52] bride
[1:06:55] That's
[1:06:58] right The Book of Revelations takes you
[1:07:00] into eternity amen the first chapter
[1:07:03] even shows you the bride at the white
[1:07:06] Throne judgment not to set on but to set
[1:07:08] on the Judgment with
[1:07:10] him not to be
[1:07:14] judged amen it shows you
[1:07:18] automatically right up to the White drum
[1:07:21] read what your Prophet had to say about
[1:07:23] it and I don't have any quotes you got a
[1:07:26] computer that's where I got mine out of
[1:07:29] the message of the hour right course
[1:07:32] this is nothing new for me could have
[1:07:33] been preaching it for what 40 years
[1:07:36] right but now let's get something right
[1:07:39] here that to me is a very valuable thing
[1:07:42] to understand the Bible to understand
[1:07:44] the prophet's message to understand
[1:07:47] anything now what is most of you know
[1:07:50] what that
[1:07:51] means that brother Dale has to see
[1:07:54] anything from part
[1:07:56] realization to perfect
[1:07:58] realization cuz that's the only way I
[1:08:00] know it's right right cuz I believe
[1:08:03] that's the way the prophet done it
[1:08:04] that's right I believe his message went
[1:08:07] from partial
[1:08:09] realization that he didn't know
[1:08:12] everything you believe he knew
[1:08:14] everything when he come there's people
[1:08:15] that believe that but I don't because he
[1:08:17] said he didn't that's right that's all
[1:08:19] right even Jesus didn't know
[1:08:23] it I'll get back to that point so don't
[1:08:26] worry about
[1:08:27] it we'll cover more on Friday night
[1:08:29] about Jesus not
[1:08:32] knowing to see more of the
[1:08:35] Bible but you see if you can't look at
[1:08:39] something in partial realization and go
[1:08:41] to perfect realization I I don't know
[1:08:43] whether you're right or not like my old
[1:08:45] saying is what you start off in Genesis
[1:08:47] with a what a white dog and you wind up
[1:08:50] in the Book of Revelation with a cow or
[1:08:52] horse or something you say Glory
[1:08:53] Hallelujah I got an animal well you're
[1:08:56] not in the Bible right if you wind up in
[1:08:59] the Book of Revelation you start out in
[1:09:01] Genesis Genesis 1 reveals a white horse
[1:09:05] I'm just giving you illustration right
[1:09:08] Revelation one got to reveal a white
[1:09:10] horse Revelation 22's got to reveal a
[1:09:13] white
[1:09:14] horse cuz if you change you didn't do
[1:09:17] what God said he said I'm God and I
[1:09:19] change
[1:09:20] not he never changed in his revelation
[1:09:26] but he can keep adding to what he brings
[1:09:29] right he can keep unfolding what he
[1:09:32] brings right did not
[1:09:34] Jesus understand about the the the world
[1:09:38] and the things and the the things of the
[1:09:40] Kingdom he just didn't know his part in
[1:09:42] it right that's what your Prophet
[1:09:46] said but when he come to the a of patmas
[1:09:48] then he knew am you think he didn't have
[1:09:51] a shot in
[1:09:53] time but listen
[1:09:56] see the Book of Revelations then had to
[1:09:59] be
[1:10:00] written because you would only
[1:10:03] have God revealed as one God and the
[1:10:08] things of the Old Testament showing
[1:10:09] Jesus and Jesus Christ and how it would
[1:10:12] be one God and how he would be living in
[1:10:15] the Saints and how he would be building
[1:10:17] the statue of a perfect Man how he would
[1:10:19] be doing all of those things but it
[1:10:21] would not be a complete Plan of
[1:10:23] Redemption right
[1:10:26] The Book of Revelation is not the
[1:10:28] revelation of who Jesus is but this
[1:10:32] revelation of his
[1:10:34] future part of
[1:10:37] it now let's see what your Prophet had
[1:10:39] to say look at number three on your
[1:10:44] note page 13 re Revelation which is 13
[1:10:48] Church H book all right it is the last
[1:10:51] book of the Bible yet it tells the
[1:10:52] beginning and the end of the
[1:10:53] dispensation of the Gospel
[1:10:55] now the Greek word for Revelation is
[1:10:58] apocalypse which means
[1:11:00] unveiling this unveiling is perfectly
[1:11:02] described an example of a sculpture
[1:11:04] unveiling his work of
[1:11:06] Statuary exposing it to the onlooker it
[1:11:10] is an uncovering revealing what was
[1:11:13] previously hidden now the uncovering is
[1:11:17] not only the revelation of the person of
[1:11:20] Christ but it is the revelation of his
[1:11:23] future work in the the oncoming seven
[1:11:26] Church ages right amen okay keep on
[1:11:33] reading this is page
[1:11:36] 14 now I said that the Book of
[1:11:38] Revelation is a revelation of Jesus and
[1:11:40] what he is doing in the churches for
[1:11:42] those Seven Ages it is a revelation
[1:11:45] because the disciples themselves did not
[1:11:46] know these recorded
[1:11:49] truths now this is actually the one I
[1:11:51] was reading a while ago so I want to go
[1:11:52] ahead and read it it is a revelation
[1:11:54] because disciples themselves didn't know
[1:11:56] these recorded truths it had not been
[1:11:59] previously revealed to them you remember
[1:12:01] that they came to Jesus in the book of
[1:12:03] Acts and asked him are you at this time
[1:12:05] going to restore the kingdom to Israel
[1:12:08] and he said it is not for you to know
[1:12:10] the times or the seasons these men were
[1:12:13] still looking for Jesus having these men
[1:12:15] were still thinking of Jesus having an
[1:12:18] Earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual
[1:12:21] Kingdom that he was going to build even
[1:12:22] he could not tell them about his place
[1:12:24] in for the father had not revealed it
[1:12:27] unto him but now after his death and
[1:12:29] resurrection and his at this particular
[1:12:32] time in his mediatorial ministry he's
[1:12:34] able to set forth here in this
[1:12:36] revelation of himself to John what his
[1:12:39] glory and presence in the church would
[1:12:40] mean and do that's a repeat of what the
[1:12:43] other right
[1:12:49] now so it's revealing what he would be
[1:12:51] doing in the ages
[1:12:55] actually the Book of Revelation shows
[1:12:57] him to being revealed as what was what
[1:12:58] is and shall be Hebrews 13:8 right right
[1:13:02] okay so now revealing his
[1:13:06] part of what he's
[1:13:09] doing I brother around and said that
[1:13:13] Jesus fulfilled his part but said he
[1:13:17] didn't fulfill it all now you need that
[1:13:19] quote he said because he left something
[1:13:22] for you and I Y
[1:13:27] something for you and I that's why I
[1:13:30] made the statement and I keep making the
[1:13:32] statement go to the Book of Revelations
[1:13:34] and show me Jesus standing anywhere by
[1:13:37] himself
[1:13:41] right come on you say no what what that
[1:13:43] mean it mean just what it
[1:13:46] says show me Jesus anywhere in the Book
[1:13:49] of Revelation by
[1:13:52] himself you don't see him in the book of
[1:13:55] Revelations outside of in his bride or
[1:13:57] in Bride form are connected with his
[1:14:01] bride other than when he turns to Israel
[1:14:03] and then you see him with
[1:14:06] Israel right he said what about that
[1:14:09] lamb over there well you better go back
[1:14:10] and study a little bit what your Prophet
[1:14:11] had to say because remember the lamb had
[1:14:14] opened the
[1:14:15] book that lamb had seven horns and seven
[1:14:18] eyes which is the seven horns which come
[1:14:21] from and your Prophet said that lamb
[1:14:23] came from the church ages right amen
[1:14:27] abely the church ages gave birth to that
[1:14:30] lamb as the Old Testament prophets gave
[1:14:32] birth to Jesus Christ
[1:14:36] right he's not there by
[1:14:39] himself cuz it's not the revelation of
[1:14:41] Jesus
[1:14:43] Amen it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:46] look at the next one page 74 Christ a
[1:14:48] mystery of God
[1:14:51] reveal which is number five on your
[1:14:54] notes
[1:14:56] then what he's the head of the body 1963
[1:14:59] 7:28 which is his church bride uh-huh
[1:15:02] then the bride body must follow the head
[1:15:05] for it is part of his resurrection and
[1:15:08] part of the mystery
[1:15:12] amen it's impossible for it not to
[1:15:16] go oh my it's part of God's mystery how
[1:15:21] God revealed himself here and raised it
[1:15:24] up by the word word so he reveals the
[1:15:27] church and raises it up by the same word
[1:15:30] it's part of his
[1:15:32] threefold mystery amen you remember the
[1:15:35] three-fold mystery all God was he put in

[1:16:05] an offspring of God that's right a
[1:16:07] daughter of God is that right then
[1:16:11] you're a Creator see everybody wants to
[1:16:13] I like when he says things like that I
[1:16:15] like to find them okay where he says
[1:16:17] you're a daughter you know cuz everybody
[1:16:19] thinks the men's the only one supposed
[1:16:20] to be doing
[1:16:23] anything I like that my wife don't like
[1:16:26] it when I make them faces that goes on
[1:16:28] in videos out there cuz my face is not
[1:16:30] to them out there to
[1:16:31] you for people to think that God thinks
[1:16:35] so much of his
[1:16:37] bride oh she was just a
[1:16:41] byproduct well she was in
[1:16:43] Adam all the rest of the animals wasn't
[1:16:46] in there mate that's right she was in
[1:16:48] Adam
[1:16:50] am God thought that much of you sisters
[1:16:53] thank you Lord that's right course I
[1:16:56] know what the fall was and what happened
[1:16:58] yeah and I know the deceptiveness and
[1:17:00] the things of that and I I know the
[1:17:02] sisters can be a thousand times more
[1:17:04] deceived than a man I know that that's
[1:17:06] not talking about how much education you
[1:17:09] got right or how much sense you got it's
[1:17:13] talking the plain truth I was thinking
[1:17:16] about it the other day I know I get
[1:17:17] aggravated sometimes what I think about
[1:17:19] and telling you you know a man he he
[1:17:22] loses his wife he goes out every once he
[1:17:25] goes around he does this you
[1:17:27] know he might stay by himself then he
[1:17:30] might not right but you know them women
[1:17:33] they get there and they get about 3
[1:17:36] months after their husband's dead they
[1:17:37] take off the black
[1:17:40] garments oh that's the way I think why I
[1:17:42] tell
[1:17:45] you you know what I'm saying women don't
[1:17:47] wear no black garments no more you take
[1:17:49] off the garments of the old husband and
[1:17:53] you go buy you some new clothes and you
[1:17:55] get all prettied up you know what you're
[1:17:56] doing you're looking for a
[1:17:59] man and you're easier to be deceived now
[1:18:01] that's what your Prophet said in the
[1:18:02] Bible says so you argue with them just
[1:18:05] get mad at brother Dale for saying it
[1:18:07] that's just pick on me that's all right
[1:18:09] that's no
[1:18:11] problem but
[1:18:14] listen look what he said future home
[1:18:16] 1964
[1:18:20] 802 he said see only the
[1:18:22] predestinated was the only will only be
[1:18:25] the one that does
[1:18:27] it only can be and you only can do it
[1:18:32] because look it proves
[1:18:34] predestination cuz if you got eternal
[1:18:38] life you had to be a part of God all
[1:18:41] times cuz he's the only one that's
[1:18:44] Eternal
[1:18:46] right now if you got eternal life that
[1:18:49] eternal life is a part of God right amen
[1:18:52] right his children are his children
[1:18:58] right look at the next one this is one I
[1:19:00] like lean not to your own understanding
[1:19:03] 1965
[1:19:05] 120 paragraph 17 so you see if you were
[1:19:09] in the forn knowledge of God then you
[1:19:12] are becoming a part of
[1:19:14] God because you predestinated unto
[1:19:16] adoption you ever noticed that right
[1:19:19] right people don't read that part they
[1:19:21] predestinated they don't see read where
[1:19:22] it says you're predestinated unto
[1:19:24] adoption
[1:19:25] unto means something you are coming to
[1:19:29] right you will eventually reach that you
[1:19:32] are not
[1:19:33] there but you will reach that
[1:19:37] un and if you're in for knowledge of God
[1:19:39] then you are becoming a part of God and
[1:19:41] the only way you can be a Son of God or
[1:19:43] a daughter of God you had to be a part
[1:19:45] of God now listen and God isn't complete
[1:19:49] without you
[1:19:50] amen amen now you want to shout over
[1:19:52] that
[1:19:55] that God isn't complete without you why
[1:19:57] cuz he United himself to you by the new
[1:20:00] birth he gave you part of his life
[1:20:04] amen he's not complete without you
[1:20:09] amen has to be that's right cuz there's
[1:20:12] only one only one resource of eternal
[1:20:14] life and that is God and him alone has
[1:20:17] eternal life see now and you were a part
[1:20:19] of him in so much that you are an
[1:20:21] attribute or in his thinking in the
[1:20:23] beginning and that because he thought of
[1:20:26] you in the beginning it gives you a
[1:20:28] little tug towards him that has to be
[1:20:31] quickened all right that's it
[1:20:35] now you're a part of
[1:20:38] God you're a child of
[1:20:41] God he's not complete without you right
[1:20:44] so the Book of
[1:20:45] Revelations even though the bride could
[1:20:47] be shown in there with Paul Peter Etc
[1:20:51] the
[1:20:52] writings but you know yourself there's
[1:20:55] very little written about the
[1:21:00] church and the reason was because it was
[1:21:02] going to come to the aisle of patmas
[1:21:04] with John and he was going to write
[1:21:06] about the
[1:21:09] church you see God's not complete
[1:21:11] without you amen
[1:21:14] right if you have eternal life right
[1:21:18] amen so then being a part of God we're a
[1:21:21] part of the Revelation we're part of the
[1:21:23] mystery the prophet of God said that
[1:21:26] this end time messenger would be
[1:21:28] pointing to the skies amen at the coming
[1:21:31] of Jesus Christ to a word born
[1:21:38] bride so I hope you're understanding now
[1:21:40] why the book of revation had to be
[1:21:42] written because it has to be listen now
[1:21:45] I'll say this and I'll back off see the
[1:21:48] Book of Revelations is the writing about
[1:21:51] the church in action right it is the
[1:21:55] book of Acts repeated again but in the
[1:21:58] book of Acts was only enough to get them
[1:22:01] into the body of Christ and get them to
[1:22:03] the Statue of a perfect man to worthy
[1:22:05] that says brotherly kindness and true
[1:22:08] baptism but the headstone did not come
[1:22:10] yet that's right is that the words of
[1:22:12] the Prophet that's right now why did he
[1:22:16] say
[1:22:19] that when was it the headstone hadn't
[1:22:22] come back there
[1:22:25] listen folks The Headstone couldn't come
[1:22:29] until the body is complete right
[1:22:33] right there's only a prophecy of its
[1:22:35] coming until it is complete but the Book
[1:22:38] of Revelation shows the bride
[1:22:42] complete when it shows it there in
[1:22:44] Revelations 133 one standing in the
[1:22:47] midst of the S golden Candlestick like
[1:22:49] unto the son of man G about to pouch for
[1:22:51] the golden girdle it's so great d until
[1:22:54] John actually starts to bow down to the
[1:22:58] feet of that
[1:23:00] one and Jesus raised him
[1:23:04] up y he had just saw the bride in
[1:23:07] Perfection
[1:23:09] yep but see we don't see ourselves that
[1:23:13] way we see our garbage cans that we live
[1:23:15] in we see one another in our ways and
[1:23:18] our actions and our doings we don't see
[1:23:20] ourselves as God sees
[1:23:22] us if we ever did get to the place we
[1:23:24] saw ourselves that way don't worry about
[1:23:26] it you're not going to run off into a
[1:23:28] garbage can of the world if you're a
[1:23:30] child of God to say you're perfect you
[1:23:32] mean you say well brother Dale You
[1:23:33] Preach perfect to the people and you try
[1:23:35] to get them to see how perfect they are
[1:23:37] and they're going out into sin the bride
[1:23:39] won't do
[1:23:40] it that's
[1:23:42] right that's right that's why your
[1:23:44] Prophet said it he said you can't get a
[1:23:47] born again woman to put on a pair of
[1:23:49] pants that's right now why did he make
[1:23:52] that statement right because it's true
[1:23:56] amen he said a born
[1:24:00] again brother h i put on some well I'd
[1:24:02] check to find out whether I born again
[1:24:04] or not that's right absolutely
[1:24:08] amen you say brother Dale Don't Preach
[1:24:10] clo line Holiness no I preach a higher
[1:24:13] line of Holiness than it's ever thought
[1:24:14] about on that line that's right because
[1:24:17] if Jesus Christ is in you and in me how
[1:24:20] can he live any other way than what he
[1:24:22] lived on this Earth that's right right
[1:24:24] there's a true revelation of Holiness
[1:24:26] that's right cuz it's not how long your
[1:24:29] sleeves are how much you it's what's in
[1:24:31] your heart well then I just got to do
[1:24:33] what want you see then you prove you're
[1:24:34] not
[1:24:36] saved that's right come on that proves
[1:24:38] you're not Sav right I do what I want
[1:24:42] to I want to serve
[1:24:48] him walking around in the garbage can
[1:24:51] yesterday
[1:24:54] he was right
[1:24:55] yesterday walking around Walmart that's
[1:24:57] what I call
[1:25:00] him you know what I'm talking about
[1:25:02] filth on every
[1:25:06] hand we didn't know anything about
[1:25:10] BB leis and them didn't find it out
[1:25:12] until we got
[1:25:14] home I was walking around too that was
[1:25:17] all that garbage can me you know you
[1:25:20] look up and there's one hanging up the
[1:25:21] ceiling you look on here you we're human
[1:25:26] right all at once something
[1:25:28] said why don't you get that and give it
[1:25:31] to Lisa and tell her
[1:25:34] congratulations said my
[1:25:39] Lord is that just a good
[1:25:42] thought we went on to another place or
[1:25:44] doing something in a little bit it says
[1:25:47] call her on the phone tell her
[1:25:49] congratulations hallelujah thank you
[1:25:51] Father you know what I thought
[1:25:55] I thought there ain't no way in the
[1:25:56] world in Walmart I'm going to call Lisa
[1:25:58] and tell her congratulations because she
[1:26:00] would shout this place down screaming in
[1:26:03] holl and they'd have her in a straight
[1:26:07] jacket but then we get
[1:26:10] home and they
[1:26:14] call you see church it's not how good
[1:26:16] you are what you are it's what he is
[1:26:18] right I've never tried to get you to see
[1:26:20] nothing but him right of how great he is
[1:26:24] amen
[1:26:25] we're not what garbage can God hasn't
[1:26:28] complete without us Soul cuz he joined
[1:26:30] himself to us that's
[1:26:34] right he saved us amen right come on
[1:26:39] bless see without the Book of
[1:26:41] Revelations you would only see God as
[1:26:44] being revealed to us as God and you
[1:26:46] would see like Paul speaking of of
[1:26:49] chains and the m in the twinkle eye
[1:26:50] you'd see the prophecies you'd see all
[1:26:52] of the things but he you would never see
[1:26:54] the fullness of God right because it was
[1:26:57] not shown there other than prophecies
[1:27:00] but the Book of Revelations is not a
[1:27:04] prophecy not
[1:27:06] prophesying it's a prophecy right
[1:27:09] prophecy is actuality of what has
[1:27:12] already happened right yep right that's
[1:27:16] what I've been trying to get you to see
[1:27:18] prophesying is talking about something
[1:27:19] to come prophecy means see why you know
[1:27:22] it's on the tap on language you can't
[1:27:24] hardly understand it but the word
[1:27:26] prophecy p r o p h e c y means that
[1:27:29] you're looking at something that has
[1:27:31] already turned out in God to be real and
[1:27:34] you see it in the book amen and he done
[1:27:36] wrote about it amen that's right he done
[1:27:39] show the bride how Eternal she is right
[1:27:42] he shows her in chapter one how's
[1:27:44] Eternal and how great she is that's
[1:27:46] right
[1:27:47] amen chapter 2 and three CHS are
[1:27:51] what Overcomers
[1:27:54] amen chapter 4 shows her in Rapture
[1:27:58] right how much more greater would we
[1:28:00] want to know what God thinks about
[1:28:02] us but
[1:28:04] listen see without the Book of
[1:28:06] Revelation you would have only partial
[1:28:08] realization of the Bible that's
[1:28:11] right you would not have perfect
[1:28:14] realization or perfect
[1:28:15] Revelation right you would have partial
[1:28:18] realization that's right all right
[1:28:25] you wouldn't have the complete Plan of
[1:28:26] Redemption that's right you would only
[1:28:28] have the part showing you a partial
[1:28:31] realization see the Redemption of the
[1:28:34] body and the world and the things like
[1:28:35] that could only be prophesied by man
[1:28:37] back dire it could not be shown in a
[1:28:41] reality but the Book of Revelation get
[1:28:43] what I'm talking about come on Gary get
[1:28:46] it the Book of Revelation is not a
[1:28:49] prophesying of something right it's
[1:28:52] actually a fulfilled proph
[1:28:54] that God is showing us the picture of
[1:28:57] it that's it it's not something to come
[1:29:01] it's already
[1:29:03] there
[1:29:07] right and the disciples didn't know the
[1:29:10] mystery that's right they didn't know
[1:29:12] the mystery of the change of the body
[1:29:15] come on Paul could only
[1:29:17] prophesy he never made it manifest right
[1:29:20] he went to the Grave right that's why he
[1:29:22] could scream out No Grave
[1:29:24] where your Victory death where you steam
[1:29:27] he could CED out yes because he was
[1:29:29] living in a world of reality of real
[1:29:31] revelation of God Amen but he still
[1:29:34] couldn't bring it into
[1:29:37] reality y only the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:40] could take it because he he's the only
[1:29:41] one who reached
[1:29:43] immortality y now do you see why the
[1:29:46] angel of the prophet of God could not
[1:29:49] tell him what the seals
[1:29:52] are do you see see why the angel of God
[1:29:55] that was with the prophet from birth
[1:29:58] could not tell him what those seals
[1:30:01] are he would have to wait until somebody
[1:30:03] else came another Mighty
[1:30:07] Angel right y that's all I'll
[1:30:11] say but he was
[1:30:14] waiting that angel couldn't tell
[1:30:17] him cuz all that angel knew was what was
[1:30:20] written in the book but that angel could
[1:30:23] tell him what was in the book
[1:30:25] book it could tell him certain things in
[1:30:28] the Book of
[1:30:29] Revelations but he couldn't tell him
[1:30:31] about the seals and the complete
[1:30:33] Revelation cuz it was not made known
[1:30:36] right see it was not written in plain
[1:30:38] language for man to understand he wrote
[1:30:40] in
[1:30:42] symbolics you'd have to wait until the
[1:30:44] prophet would be able to come see could
[1:30:47] not be made known what time to
[1:30:50] understand righten
[1:30:54] see you believe that brother random was
[1:30:56] born to Prophet amen but why didn't he
[1:31:00] know everything when he's here that's
[1:31:04] right lot of people believed he did but
[1:31:07] he said he didn't now going to believe
[1:31:09] him amen but why he didn't know
[1:31:12] everything did he now either he lied or
[1:31:15] whatever so you can do what you want to
[1:31:16] with it he said on that first s he said
[1:31:18] I don't know what it
[1:31:20] is and he said I made a horrible meetic
[1:31:25] if the Holy Ghost had not come to
[1:31:26] straighten him out on that he would have
[1:31:28] preached a white horse
[1:31:30] rider as the Holy Ghost cuz he'd already
[1:31:33] preached he take away all of his
[1:31:38] ministry he said I don't make a horrible
[1:31:40] mistake if he hadn't to
[1:31:42] come who's the he see that's what
[1:31:45] everybody wants to do they think it's so
[1:31:46] great a revelation oh brother Dale
[1:31:49] you're belittling brother Bram because
[1:31:51] we believe and all across the land the
[1:31:53] Great names are preaching now that
[1:31:56] brother random was the one that come to
[1:31:58] John on
[1:32:00] patas you hadn't heard that hang on or
[1:32:03] listen a little bit maybe you already
[1:32:04] open your ears up
[1:32:07] right cuz some of you sat here the other
[1:32:09] day when that man was preaching it
[1:32:10] didn't catch it then he even said
[1:32:16] it man he preached just recently here
[1:32:19] that's
[1:32:20] right preach that brother brandham was
[1:32:22] the one that come to on P how many of
[1:32:25] you caught it was you asleep

[1:32:38] if it is the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:41] upset why can't you hear what people say
[1:32:45] right that's right but you can hear
[1:32:48] everything I say that's a little
[1:32:50] wrong you let me make a quote wrong
[1:32:53] somewhere and somebody will meet me
[1:32:55] before I get outside you said that
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:32:59] wrong but these others
[1:33:05] no why was it that Jesus didn't know his
[1:33:08] part in the
[1:33:12] kingdom come on that's right the same
[1:33:16] reason that Jesus didn't know his part
[1:33:17] in the kingdom is the same reason the
[1:33:19] angel of the Lord that was with brother
[1:33:21] brandham that told him about serpent SE
[1:33:23] that told him about all these great
[1:33:25] things come on did he tell him about it
[1:33:27] did he show him in the
[1:33:30] word but when it come to them seals and
[1:33:33] things that angel didn't tell him about
[1:33:35] marriage and
[1:33:36] divorce that's right it took the great
[1:33:40] one to come amen that's right that's
[1:33:43] that right but you see everybody thinks
[1:33:45] that you got to breach something to be
[1:33:46] great Keling tzing things you know to
[1:33:48] make them make people oh I just I can
[1:33:51] just see how brother random come to

[1:33:59] know what the angel told you right amen
[1:34:03] I want to know what the angel told
[1:34:05] brother brandom amen not what brother
[1:34:08] brandham told John if that's who that
[1:34:10] was I want to know what the angel told
[1:34:13] brother
[1:34:16] Brandon see because that's the only way
[1:34:18] I'm going to get out of here amen see
[1:34:20] the reason that Jesus did not know his
[1:34:24] part is because it had not been revealed
[1:34:27] unto him
[1:34:29] right that's the reason the angel
[1:34:31] couldn't tell it it hadn't been it
[1:34:33] wasn't
[1:34:34] revealed it was the secret thing the
[1:34:37] Book of
[1:34:38] Revelations the sealed and things was
[1:34:40] sealed
[1:34:44] up I
[1:34:49] can't I just wish you would take what he
[1:34:51] said to you sometimes and study it
[1:34:54] I we should take what way preached there
[1:34:56] Wednesday that the Book of Revelation
[1:34:58] and the Book of Genesis shows
[1:35:00] identically the same thing
[1:35:05] that's but how many of you thought
[1:35:07] anything about
[1:35:10] it so
[1:35:14] far now
[1:35:16] listen you got to go from partial
[1:35:19] realization to perfect realization
[1:35:20] that's right now when the Lord Jesus
[1:35:23] Christ was here in Matthew
[1:35:26] 24 he preached six seals that's right
[1:35:30] you agree amen he preached them but
[1:35:34] nobody knew what he's talking about
[1:35:36] right that's right now some of the
[1:35:37] denominations cuz we did his
[1:35:40] Baptist we could understand enough to
[1:35:42] take the Matthew 24 what is it's a six
[1:35:45] seal anyway when it gets over to there
[1:35:47] and could see the tribulation well man
[1:35:49] we had it all goofed up had it all over
[1:35:51] the place and everything 7 years of it
[1:35:53] and all kind of things right but you
[1:35:56] know what I'm talking about cler Larin
[1:36:00] almost 100 years before brother brandom
[1:36:02] preached that the white horse rider was
[1:36:04] the
[1:36:06] Antichrist but you know he didn't know
[1:36:09] it that's just a good
[1:36:11] guess so you were not Tau like that
[1:36:13] wouldn't you tell me it wasn't the word
[1:36:15] had to come to the prophet right that's
[1:36:18] it
[1:36:19] amen it was sheld up until then right
[1:36:26] it was down in that pyramid and he ped
[1:36:28] the top
[1:36:29] off
[1:36:31] right the writing was down inside not
[1:36:34] outside where man could read
[1:36:36] it man could read the Bible up to the
[1:36:39] book of
[1:36:41] Jude and he can understand some things
[1:36:43] in the Book of Revelation but he
[1:36:45] couldn't get the real meaning of all of
[1:36:48] it I just ask you a good question
[1:36:54] I've asked you this many of times and
[1:36:55] preached on it many many many times
[1:36:59] before Moses got 10 commandments and
[1:37:02] wrote five
[1:37:07] books is that true right hey I know see
[1:37:12] I know how smart people are there's two
[1:37:14] quotes that brother around said Moses
[1:37:15] just wrote four
[1:37:19] books see I studi it all out before I
[1:37:22] bring but there's also two more around
[1:37:25] and said Moses wrote five
[1:37:30] books you say are you your as a
[1:37:32] contradiction no sir just a misstatement
[1:37:35] of a prophet how else could it be cuz he
[1:37:38] knew M just wrote five books where did
[1:37:40] he know of what happened in the
[1:37:43] garden the same way yeah that Jesus come
[1:37:47] to John that the lord gave a revelation
[1:37:50] to Jesus Christ to give to John on pap
[1:37:52] right
[1:37:55] the Lord Jesus preached six seals but no
[1:37:57] one knew what that was about no riters
[1:38:00] or anything could follow that and
[1:38:02] understand they had it all messed
[1:38:04] up
[1:38:06] why because the anointing that was on
[1:38:09] the Lord Jesus Christ to preach that
[1:38:12] left him in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:38:14] that's right now that's according to
[1:38:16] what it's on number uh nine of your
[1:38:20] notes this rising of the sun said the
[1:38:22] spirit left him in the garden
[1:38:24] all right we turn on over number 10 says
[1:38:28] the manifested sons of God 1960 says the
[1:38:33] anointing left him in the
[1:38:36] garden but I like number 11 there where
[1:38:39] the Prophet said it a long time
[1:38:42] ago after the door of the Gentile church
[1:38:44] is closed God will anoint a
[1:38:47] church and God will do in one year what
[1:38:50] theologist has tried to do in 2000 right
[1:38:53] but I like the way he says said
[1:38:54] everybody he's doing it now right that's
[1:38:57] where people think there's nothing going
[1:38:59] on but they don't see things like this
[1:39:01] this is the way I see things and I'm
[1:39:03] sorry if that's the way I do
[1:39:06] it not sorry sorry for
[1:39:10] you we're promised an anointing to come
[1:39:13] to the church again in the end time
[1:39:15] right with the same Ministry of Jesus
[1:39:17] Christ
[1:39:18] y but I wish you would go down the line
[1:39:21] and read those things that I gave you
[1:39:23] they brother around him in 1954 on the
[1:39:26] message unconditional
[1:39:29] Covenant number 12 on your notes and
[1:39:32] read what he said that the same Ministry
[1:39:35] of Jesus Christ was right there in the
[1:39:37] church then
[1:39:44] right see I know that's what it
[1:39:47] says partial realization the same
[1:39:50] Ministry that the Lord Jesus Christ had
[1:39:52] cuz what happened in the garden to
[1:39:56] Gethsemane oh of course everybody can
[1:39:58] preach all about the river Jordans and
[1:39:59] all about these things but they can't
[1:40:01] get down in there and deal with it where
[1:40:02] it's really haing it that's right
[1:40:06] amen Y what fell on the day of
[1:40:10] Pentecost the faith of the fathers
[1:40:14] amen the faith of the fathers come on a
[1:40:17] de of
[1:40:18] Pentecost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:40:21] came on the 120 na room up to where you
[1:40:24] see where it says holy spirit on the
[1:40:26] pyramid and all these things were sealed
[1:40:28] in them but they didn't have the
[1:40:29] headstone that's what your Prophet said
[1:40:33] right that's on Daniel 70 weeks if you
[1:40:35] wanted there's plenty more be glad to
[1:40:37] get them for
[1:40:40] you but go on down look at the next
[1:40:43] Faith once delivered
[1:40:45] 1955 he delivered to his
[1:40:49] Apostles the same Ministry that he had
[1:40:57] are you reading
[1:41:03] them next one Jesus Christ is sign 56
[1:41:07] 205 that Jesus had the apostles to carry
[1:41:11] on the same Ministry that he
[1:41:14] [Applause]
[1:41:19] had now that didn't even talk about The
[1:41:21] Headstone is it
[1:41:24] right see that's why people don't
[1:41:26] understand why brother R would make a
[1:41:27] statement it's it's on down it's on the
[1:41:30] back page of this notes that you got
[1:41:32] here brother brandom where he says 3:27
[1:41:34] let you'll see in church age this
[1:41:36] messenger of Malachi 4 and Luke 17:30 is
[1:41:38] going to do two things one turn the
[1:41:40] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:41:41] of the father two reveal the seven
[1:41:43] Thunders which is a revelation contained
[1:41:45] in the seven seal and it'll be these
[1:41:47] divinely reveal mystery truths that
[1:41:48] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:41:49] children back to the faith of the
[1:41:50] fathers I'm quoting it off the page
[1:41:52] there
[1:41:54] right cuz you see that Prophet had to
[1:41:58] turn the hearts of the children back
[1:42:00] that's right before you can talk about
[1:42:02] the SE right amen that's true see that's
[1:42:05] the ministry that Jesus Christ put in
[1:42:06] the church on the day of Pentecost the
[1:42:08] ministry of Jesus Christ that he had
[1:42:11] while he was on Earth but the headstone
[1:42:14] done left him in the garden right so it
[1:42:17] couldn't come on the day of Pentecost
[1:42:18] well give me a quote for that well quote
[1:42:20] rather forget it I ain't going to argue
[1:42:23] with you about it amen that's I Don't
[1:42:25] Preach too
[1:42:26] long I don't mean tonight I'm talking
[1:42:28] about all the
[1:42:32] years They carried it
[1:42:36] on look at the one where he saying uh
[1:42:39] the sign of the Messiah not number 15 on
[1:42:41] your notes he talking about that when
[1:42:42] you were here in the body of Flesh the
[1:42:46] ministry is here now he said like it was
[1:42:49] here when you was in the body of Flesh
[1:42:56] see brother random is telling you the
[1:42:58] ministry of Jesus Christ was on the day
[1:43:00] of
[1:43:02] Pentecost whose Ministry was it come on
[1:43:07] right and down Through the Ages it's
[1:43:10] been the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:43:14] right
[1:43:20] right look on down to the next one
[1:43:23] number 16 322 paragraph 322 as I was
[1:43:28] with Moses 196
[1:43:31] 911
[1:43:33] 0911 morning service he said it's the
[1:43:36] same Ministry in a higher
[1:43:40] spear now we're going to change
[1:43:43] over a Ministry in a higher spear what
[1:43:47] do you mean brother
[1:43:48] brandom I mean Jesus Christ was here on
[1:43:51] the day of Pentecost and Jesus Christ
[1:43:53] has been the same yesterday today and
[1:43:55] forever mankind changed but the Holy
[1:43:58] Ghost has always been here in every age
[1:44:00] to give a new birth it was the word that
[1:44:02] was eat down it was not the holy ghost
[1:44:04] that was taken away that's why the Bible
[1:44:06] said the seven spirits of
[1:44:09] God your Prophet said that's a holy
[1:44:11] ghost in seven Church ages
[1:44:18] right he said the same
[1:44:21] Ministry look at number 17 Watchman what
[1:44:25] other night he's already speaking of
[1:44:27] something to come now cuz he just said
[1:44:28] it over here in a greater Spirit
[1:44:30] something fixing to happen now he begins
[1:44:32] to see it what does he see he says that
[1:44:34] the same light that went down is going
[1:44:36] to come
[1:44:38] back the same light that went down is
[1:44:40] going to come back and when it comes
[1:44:42] back it's going to come back with the
[1:44:45] same Ministry Jesus
[1:44:47] Christ so people can't look at around
[1:44:50] and see what's taking place at the
[1:44:51] ministry of Jesus Christ is here they're
[1:44:53] only looking for some kind of a
[1:44:54] headstone or some kind of a something
[1:44:56] they want to see the Great Signs and the
[1:44:58] Wonders and the things like
[1:45:08] that
[1:45:11] 1961 Abraham's Covenant
[1:45:14] confirmed
[1:45:16] E40 the same Ministry to shape
[1:45:20] up in the end time
[1:45:24] paragraph 63 of the same message it will
[1:45:26] come forth in full strength these are on
[1:45:28] the computer that people can read you
[1:45:30] read them yourself as I'm scanning
[1:45:36] down 1962 look as he's getting well
[1:45:39] let's see take it take on the whole
[1:45:41] armor 62
[1:45:43] 71 and he says he had it
[1:45:47] here he said other words is here he was
[1:45:50] getting ready you know what brother
[1:45:52] Brandon was doing
[1:45:55] you know why he was preaching on uh is
[1:45:58] this the sign of the end time service or
[1:46:00] whatever it was you
[1:46:03] know when he was saying I don't know
[1:46:05] what's going to take place but said it's
[1:46:07] either one thing he said I'm going off
[1:46:08] the scener that's going to step into
[1:46:10] something
[1:46:12] higher right he thought it was his death
[1:46:15] right but it wasn't his death it was to
[1:46:18] step into a greater ministry right
[1:46:23] we would see
[1:46:25] Jesus same thing he did
[1:46:29] here standing in the Gap
[1:46:32] 63
[1:46:33] 623 same Ministry that Jesus Christ did
[1:46:38] Y is here now he says modern events made
[1:46:42] clear by prophecy
[1:46:44] 65 the same Ministry in the bride and
[1:46:47] the groom
[1:46:57] the same
[1:47:00] Ministry there's where your headstone
[1:47:02] comes into
[1:47:03] being the ministry of Jesus Christ has
[1:47:05] been in the church don't miss
[1:47:07] that that's what I've tried my best to
[1:47:10] explain here to you and a lot of people
[1:47:12] said well brother Dell don't believe in
[1:47:20] manifestation there ain't nobody in the
[1:47:22] building believes in more manifestation
[1:47:23] than I
[1:47:25] do but there's one thing about it you
[1:47:27] can't make God do
[1:47:29] nothing you're only going to get
[1:47:31] yourself in trouble
[1:47:33] trying I've tried to explain adoption to
[1:47:38] you adoption is not the father going off
[1:47:41] the scene and the son coming on the
[1:47:43] scene that's what everybody thinks it is
[1:47:47] not it is the Sun going off the scene
[1:47:52] and Mak making his father
[1:47:54] manifest
[1:47:56] right
[1:47:58] Hallelujah getting rid of our nature and
[1:48:01] getting the nature of almighty God to
[1:48:03] come and live in us there's adoption
[1:48:06] amen amen that's right the father is
[1:48:09] coming on the
[1:48:10] scene let me ask you one question and I
[1:48:13] won't say another word on it
[1:48:16] either who did Jesus come to make known
[1:48:25] according to him he said he come to make
[1:48:27] the father known
[1:48:30] right well you know that's kind of all
[1:48:32] to do away with your thoughts about it
[1:48:34] that the father's going to go off the
[1:48:35] scene and the son come on the scene in
[1:48:37] such a great way look at me look at me
[1:48:40] look what I can
[1:48:42] do no no no no don't do that way just
[1:48:46] getting ourselves out of the way letting
[1:48:47] the father come on the S there's
[1:48:48] adoption amen that's right you say yeah
[1:48:52] but that way according to so and I don't
[1:48:53] care what so and so preaches I don't
[1:48:55] care what anybody preaches I preach what
[1:48:57] I believe they got a responsibility to
[1:48:59] preach what they believe but you know
[1:49:01] yourself that that hadn't changed in 40
[1:49:03] years because I've always preached that
[1:49:04] to you that
[1:49:07] adoption is the son actually taking on
[1:49:12] himself the nature of the father until
[1:49:15] the father is one that gives him the
[1:49:17] signant the father has given all the
[1:49:19] responsibility it is not the son
[1:49:23] Jesus didn't come to make himself
[1:49:28] known he come to make the father
[1:49:34] known yeah brother Dale you no you
[1:49:37] you're wrong you say well brother D
[1:49:39] don't believe in manifestation I believe
[1:49:41] in the correct
[1:49:43] manifestation that's
[1:49:46] right because you haven't even never
[1:49:48] looked up the word manifest have you you
[1:49:50] ever looked it up the word manifest
[1:49:52] seems to be make
[1:49:55] known in the days of the manifestation
[1:49:57] of the sons of God what does that word
[1:49:59] mean means to make
[1:50:01] known y now maybe you forgot where we
[1:50:04] read while
[1:50:07] ago when we first
[1:50:12] started that this was not the revelation
[1:50:14] of Jesus but the revelation of Jesus
[1:50:16] Christ that's right
[1:50:24] that almighty
[1:50:27] God and bring his
[1:50:29] nature into a human mortal right that's
[1:50:32] right that's
[1:50:35] it make known see you make God known
[1:50:40] he'll make you known don't you worry
[1:50:41] about it
[1:50:43] amen but you make yourself known what do
[1:50:46] you got anointed
[1:50:49] ones look what I can do no
[1:50:53] you better get that out of your mind
[1:50:55] completely amen just look what he can do
[1:50:57] through me amen like I told you when I
[1:51:00] was walking around that store I wasn't
[1:51:01] thinking
[1:51:03] about nothing about anything about Lisa
[1:51:06] and didn't know anything about it and
[1:51:09] here he comes down it's not you it's him
[1:51:14] that's
[1:51:15] right sister Gail when he spoke to you
[1:51:18] there in your kitchen walking through
[1:51:19] there and said one God's correct
[1:51:23] was that
[1:51:25] you thinking wasn't even thinking about
[1:51:30] it wasn't even thinking about it all
[1:51:35] right I wrote notes to preach o seals
[1:51:37] that I preach in 82 and ' 83 off of a
[1:51:40] job that it took two men to run when I
[1:51:42] was out of work that's no joke these
[1:51:44] brothers can tell you it took two people
[1:51:47] to run my job man could not relieve me
[1:51:50] 16 minutes and keep my job
[1:51:54] Rob but I ran it and I wrote notes for
[1:51:56] the sermons of the
[1:51:59] seals off of a job that it cost that
[1:52:02] much
[1:52:06] that that two people that took them to
[1:52:11] run you
[1:52:13] see it's not you
[1:52:18] right and Jesus is not even trying to
[1:52:20] reveal himself
[1:52:23] he come to make known the father
[1:52:28] right have you ever heard brother
[1:52:30] Brandon I end it with this you ever
[1:52:31] heard brother brandom I'm talking about
[1:52:33] many many
[1:52:34] times when he'd be
[1:52:39] praying he' said
[1:52:42] father I thank you for sending your son
[1:52:45] Jesus Christ to die for
[1:52:47] me
[1:52:49] Y how many times have you ever heard him
[1:52:51] say that amen yeah
[1:52:54] right how many other times you ever
[1:52:56] heard him thank the father for sending
[1:52:58] the
[1:53:02] son but how many times you ever read in
[1:53:04] the Bible where the son was trying to
[1:53:05] make your
[1:53:11] manifest all he could do was what God
[1:53:13] told him that's right he said you ask
[1:53:15] the father anything in my
[1:53:19] name and he'll give it to you
[1:53:23] Jesus made the father
[1:53:26] glorified am I quoting brother brandom
[1:53:28] adoption glorifies Jesus Christ right
[1:53:32] amen it don't glorify you and me right
[1:53:35] that's
[1:53:37] right yes but brother Dale brother so
[1:53:39] and so this makes me feel so good when I
[1:53:41] hear him
[1:53:42] preach you didn't enjoy it in the school
[1:53:45] when the first day they said I want to
[1:53:47] tell you
[1:53:48] something 1 + 1 = 2
[1:53:55] right you went home you told Mama come
[1:53:59] on ministers I mean the musician come on
[1:54:02] minister to it don't
[1:54:05] matter so what' you do you went home to
[1:54:08] a Mama said Mama I know something what 1
[1:54:12] + 1 =
[1:54:16] 2 you went back the next day and the
[1:54:19] teacher said now what's our lesson for
[1:54:22] today day 1 + 1 =
[1:54:25] 2 and for a whole
[1:54:28] week that's all she talked
[1:54:31] about and Illustrated and made
[1:54:37] drawings finally one day she said now

[1:54:42] higher 2 + 2 is
[1:54:48] 4 you went home you said mama two plus
[1:54:52] two is
[1:54:54] four then for a week that's all you
[1:54:58] got you understand what I'm trying to
[1:55:01] illustrate I don't claim to be a teacher
[1:55:04] I'm just what I am in the body of Christ
[1:55:06] but I try to hold the same thing up
[1:55:08] before you and try to give you something
[1:55:10] to think
[1:55:11] about but you going to go home and say
[1:55:14] Brother D don't know what he's talking
[1:55:15] about cuz he's doing way with this he's
[1:55:16] doing away with that he's Trenary and
[1:55:18] he's this that of the
[1:55:21] other well come on let's hear you preach
[1:55:23] it
[1:55:27] right well brother Dale all I see was
[1:55:30] that all God was he poured into
[1:55:32] Christ and all Christ in the
[1:55:35] church
[1:55:39] well if you poured all of God into
[1:55:43] Christ and don't know what you're
[1:55:44] talking about then you just done away
[1:55:46] with
[1:55:47] God and you're headed to a Oneness
[1:55:49] Doctrine that's exactly right amen then
[1:55:52] you say oh Christ good he poured into
[1:55:54] the church well then you don't have no
[1:55:55] Christ no more all he got the
[1:56:01] church brother brother Brown said that
[1:56:03] over and over amen cuz he knew what he
[1:56:06] talking about that's right just like I
[1:56:07] said he knew what he's talking about
[1:56:09] when he'd pray he'd say
[1:56:11] father thank you for sending your
[1:56:17] son right
[1:56:26] but he would a
[1:56:29] trinitarian you knew what he's talking
[1:56:31] about that's
[1:56:33] right but you take partial realization
[1:56:36] and you understand the ministry of Jesus
[1:56:38] Christ is living in the church been in
[1:56:40] the church down Through the
[1:56:46] Ages that's the only way you can come
[1:56:48] out to see perfect realization in the
[1:56:51] end time amen when The Headstone comes
[1:56:54] that perfect realization can come become
[1:56:56] perfect

[1:57:56] them before they could enter the
