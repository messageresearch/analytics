[4:58] Word and healers so if we believe it
[5:01] accept the word
[5:03] and if something revealed to you I've
[5:05] always tried to tell you that's the way
[5:07] I deal the way I do if something is made
[5:10] known to me
[5:11] then immediately I claim my blessings to
[5:15] go with that whether it be my family or
[5:18] whether it be the opening of the word to
[5:20] further degree whatever right when he's
[5:23] revealing to you is the best time to

[5:55] all these troubles and things and just
[5:58] touch each one got us all by thy living
[6:00] grace we thank you for all things in
[6:03] Jesus name you mean we go to Galatians I
[6:10] mean to Ephesians 2 for by grace are you
[6:14] saved through faith and that not of
[6:16] yourselves it is the gift of God what
[6:18] are we talking on a growth development
[6:21] in Christianity right go now let's go
[6:26] over to Galatians 4
[6:30] and I say that the air as long as he is
[6:32] a child there was nothing from a servant
[6:34] though he be Lord of all but is under
[6:38] tutors and governors if you go back up
[6:40] above there you'll find us called it
[6:42] schoolmaster all right until the time
[6:45] appointed of the Father even so we when
[6:48] we were children were in bondage under
[6:51] the elements of the world but when the
[6:53] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[6:56] his son made of a woman made under the
[6:59] law to redeem them that were under the
[7:02] law that we might receive the adoption
[7:04] of sons and because you are sons God has
[7:09] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[7:11] your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore
[7:16] thou art no more servant but a son and
[7:19] if a son then an heir of God through
[7:21] Christ Jesus you may be seated the Lord
[7:24] had his blessing to the reading of the
[7:26] word now what I want you to think on I
[7:31] want you to think on something as a
[7:33] point that will be trying to make it
[7:35] miss this message and then when we get
[7:38] back and pick up on what it is I believe
[7:46] that the Bible is the Word of God now we
[7:50] all believe that but now what I'm
[7:53] wanting you to think about that it's
[7:56] written by how many 50 60 writers I
[7:59] forgot him in they say that was that
[8:02] it's written by different writers
[8:03] throughout the Old Testament throughout
[8:05] the New Testament different writers but
[8:08] all of those writers were speaking about
[8:12] the same point or thought no in that
[8:17] marvelous it doesn't matter what you
[8:20] read it's the plan of redemption you
[8:22] read in the Old Testament it's the plan
[8:25] of redemption you read where David
[8:26] killed Goliath that's the plan of
[8:28] redemption that's that was a sent forth
[8:31] you know to help the people to guide
[8:35] where Moses was leading them out to take
[8:37] them to the promised land
[8:39] all of the Bible being written by
[8:41] mankind
[8:42] it all ties together to reveal Jesus
[8:45] Christ now right it is the complete
[8:49] revelation of Jesus Christ from Genesis
[8:52] to Revelation showing God and his ways
[8:56] and what he had done and as we were
[8:58] reading here that God sent forth his son
[9:01] see this happened that happened this
[9:03] that brought into being to her that it
[9:07] would reveal Jesus Christ to each one
[9:11] now here's my thought it's an odd
[9:13] thought but you'll get back to it in a
[9:15] minute what if all you had was what
[9:22] Peter said you know what if that's how
[9:29] you had
[9:34] you get the point when I'm driving what
[9:36] if you had only what Paul said they'll
[9:41] get the point we'll illustrate it
[9:43] throughout the message you'll see that
[9:44] Peter and Paul were saying the same
[9:46] thing but Paul carries the thought into
[9:49] a much deeper meaning and brings out
[9:53] things that Peter did not speak about
[9:57] but now he was speaking of the same
[10:00] revelation but not the depth or the
[10:04] thought of the Apostle Paul even - Peter
[10:07] said that people say that Paul said
[10:09] things hard to be understood there's
[10:11] some rationale to their own destruction
[10:13] you know by not understanding it all
[10:16] right now so what if you had though what
[10:20] Paul talked you know now that would be a
[10:26] great understanding to have what Paul
[10:30] taught a great opportunity to hold and
[10:34] and cherish what if that's all you had
[10:43] see then you'd have Paul talking about
[10:47] change the moment at wink of an eye a
[10:50] great understanding a great thing to
[10:55] bring forth but just remember he never
[10:58] attained to it right the follow the
[11:04] point don't get lost in into jangling up
[11:07] all of what you think I'm talking about
[11:09] just listen to I'm talking about all
[11:11] right
[11:13] the if you had-even what Paul had said
[11:18] it wouldn't be enough
[11:25] if you had Peter what he said wouldn't
[11:29] be enough you got John what he said
[11:32] James
[11:34] Timothy you know whatever to isolate our
[11:38] whatever to pull apart and not have all
[11:44] of the word but we're in the end time
[11:47] that we're supposed to have the entire
[11:49] Word of God right now seize the
[11:53] opportunity so remember that point now
[11:55] that if Paul had brought forth all he
[12:01] brought but it still wouldn't be enough
[12:02] you said well why do you say it wouldn't
[12:04] be enough it didn't make it his prophecy
[12:10] was of the future most of Paul's riding
[12:14] spoke into a later day a later time a
[12:18] time to come we'll get into the
[12:20] scriptures after a while
[12:22] he talked about this mortal change into
[12:25] immortality but he never attained to it
[12:30] alright see then by doing that you can
[12:35] see why that we had to have
[12:40] even if you took night let's play don't
[12:43] down get it real strong now huh even if
[12:46] you took all of the writers of the Bible
[12:51] I are you listening all of the writers
[12:55] of the Bible and what they wrote and
[12:57] their their revelation of God you
[13:03] realize it would still wouldn't be
[13:04] enough oh you're sure funny I love it
[13:12] though sometimes it does match real good
[13:16] but you know stops thing with me you see
[13:21] then you would be left without the
[13:25] prophet of Malacca for to be able to
[13:30] give you the perfect interpretation now
[13:35] that's what he said now Paul never said
[13:38] he had perfect understand it Luke was
[13:41] the best he come close enough he said
[13:44] having perfect understanding well yet we
[13:45] know Luke wouldn't a impossible I mean
[13:48] wouldn't a prophet in time all right
[13:50] let's see do you understand what I'm
[13:52] driving it without brother branham to
[13:54] come along to take whatever it was
[13:56] brought to us no matter if you had
[13:59] everybody and we have everybody right we
[14:05] have whatever body has talked now not
[14:08] everybody in the whole thing but we have
[14:10] the Bible has taught that is spread the
[14:15] Prophet will say as much as man note see
[14:21] then he came on the scene to bring up
[14:26] the loose ends because he said down to
[14:29] the ages even into that he said they was
[14:31] loose ends left and in this messenger
[14:34] would have to take all that and tie
[14:35] together
[14:37] all right see thank God for what we've
[14:42] had what we have delivered under you and
[14:46] I is the most wonderful opportunity
[14:49] there is to think about that God has
[14:51] given us not only the written word and
[14:56] not only given us the opportunity to
[14:58] study all the writers of the word and
[15:00] follow their teachings and examples and
[15:04] revelation but he summed it up by
[15:07] bringing a message or in the end time to
[15:10] take all the loose ends and the Prophet
[15:13] said take it on to the rapture no you
[15:23] don't think like I do cuz I know I'm
[15:25] glad she don't see he says take it on to
[15:29] the rapture well right now there's
[15:32] nothing beyond that right I mean you
[15:36] change the moment wing a lot you're
[15:37] going to be with the Lord the rats are
[15:39] taking place you're going right I mean
[15:41] that's taken up
[15:43] well what about all these in the grave
[15:46] with the great revelation the Apostle
[15:49] Paul had of something that Peter never
[15:55] spoke of you're gonna have to think with
[16:01] it and I because I'm trying to get you
[16:02] to think about something that will be a
[16:04] basic background to try to understand
[16:07] then the statue of a perfect man and
[16:10] what things are and what we have need of
[16:13] where the Prophet says you know that
[16:16] we've got to have these things it's not
[16:20] to just talk about it we've got to have
[16:23] it revealed and made alive in our hearts
[16:25] or what or we're gonna keep dining going
[16:29] by the grave I'm sorry to keep
[16:36] mentioning things but try to make you
[16:37] wake up but see 40 years ago the Lord
[16:40] told me that you heard it over and over
[16:44] and over so it ain't one I've come up
[16:45] with last week some of you been here for
[16:48] 30 40 years you know I said it back then
[16:50] that the biggest portion of people of
[16:52] this message would have to die and go by
[16:54] the grave and I had no intentions or
[16:58] thoughts involved in any of it to D
[17:01] Christianize any person
[17:05] now you've heard that over and over and
[17:07] over then I said to you and see I had no
[17:11] thoughts of thinking about well they're
[17:13] not born again no no my point was one
[17:19] thing you and I are gonna go by the
[17:22] grave if we don't come to the right
[17:24] place in God whether we like it or not
[17:27] now all right
[17:32] and let's see until somebody comes to
[17:35] that position in the word mankind will
[17:40] keep on dying going by the ground that's
[17:43] not the Christian eye that's not saying
[17:45] nobody's a Christian I said that then I
[17:47] said now I'm not saying that they they
[17:49] were no I said they could be born-again
[17:51] believers cuz you look at it look at age
[17:54] and what what is taking a toll upon the
[17:56] people of this message of how old a lot
[17:58] of us have got how death is taking
[18:00] people that's not G Christianizing
[18:02] anybody you think I knew something like
[18:05] that doesn't be smart aleck
[18:08] I can't have it I told you what the Lord
[18:10] told me you said well I don't know where
[18:15] was the Lord enough well that's all
[18:16] right ain't got nothing do with it yeah
[18:21] one of these days we'll find out that'll
[18:24] be all right but you ain't gonna get
[18:25] kicked out of heaven because that you
[18:27] don't believe what brother Dale says cuz
[18:29] ain't never been nothing like that tall
[18:31] around here okay all right now listen to
[18:34] the point then so you could take ever
[18:39] writer we have every writer in the Bible
[18:44] what they said about the revelation of
[18:48] God for their time and all like that
[18:54] whether it be Old Testament speaking of
[18:56] Jesus Christ to come
[19:00] or whether it be the New Testament with
[19:03] Christ being here with us are being over
[19:06] in the New Testament to come forth after
[19:07] Christ coming to bring us to those
[19:10] places see did if you shortcut yourself
[19:16] any work then look what you're doing
[19:21] say for instance you'd say well I
[19:24] believe what Paul said but I don't know
[19:26] about what Peter said whenever to me
[19:31] your shortcut in your own self you're
[19:32] cutting your own throat as the old
[19:33] saying goes because it wouldn't be in
[19:38] God's Word brother Brennan said Peter
[19:43] and Paul talked the same thing but now
[19:50] before we get to the Knights you're
[19:52] gonna find out that Peter never taught
[19:54] the depth of the Apostle Paul cuz that
[19:58] scripture that Paul says things hard to
[20:02] be understood will try to lay it down
[20:07] and and pick up the thought right out of
[20:09] the word and see if that's true or not
[20:11] okay what are you following me
[20:18] we could never come to the complete
[20:21] fullness of redemption without what
[20:28] Peter and Paul taught and this using
[20:34] those two as illustrations I'm talking
[20:35] about what everybody thought now
[20:38] toothiness rate is now that's laid upon
[20:41] the point of believing what this prophet
[20:44] has told
[20:48] of redemption to tell all of the things
[20:57] that mankind had not been able to put
[20:59] together
[20:59] totally and bring it to a complete
[21:03] revelation and bring a church to a place
[21:08] that according to the Prophet he said
[21:10] she's to be delivered of a new birth
[21:12] from according to Malachi 4 I'm not
[21:18] fussing with nobody out there on the
[21:20] Internet's and stuff like of what they
[21:22] believe and how they say brother Branham
[21:23] was wrong here a wrong gar that has
[21:25] nothing to do with me I said what I said
[21:29] 40 years ago and I said it tonight
[21:31] I don't care what you can prove how much
[21:35] wrong brother Branham was wrong in all
[21:37] of his life or what he done that has
[21:40] nothing to do with me it's what he has
[21:42] done for me
[21:43] he has brought by way of the Holy Spirit
[21:45] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[21:48] to me now that was where I say that I
[21:52] don't care what you say then you say
[21:54] well brother Branham was this and
[21:55] brother Brandon was that I don't care
[21:58] then when it turned around like that I
[22:00] know for sure that he wasn't this or
[22:02] that and everybody claiming he is there
[22:04] was
[22:06] a human being yes mistakes yes but not
[22:14] in the world show me once mistaking the
[22:19] word and see I told you this 40 years
[22:21] ago I said the day you'll come you won't
[22:25] be just fighting against quotes and
[22:27] things some shaking their head they know
[22:31] I said it that way maybe not was with me
[22:33] them they know I've said it since then
[22:35] enough do you order know what I said
[22:36] that not that you know in other words
[22:39] they're the people of the message
[22:43] they're destroying their own selves the
[22:47] denominations can't destroy us they're
[22:53] not gonna send down this great big thing
[22:54] and kill us all cause we believe a
[22:57] message by William Branham
[23:00] there's no need of it just leave them
[23:04] alone and start doctrines among us let
[23:06] the devil go from church to church till
[23:08] he spreads his his things and you don't
[23:10] need to it you don't kill them anyway
[23:13] right you don't have to shoot somebody
[23:17] to kill you kill their influence and you
[23:20] kill that person and see that's what
[23:24] it's doing with the message of people's
[23:25] do it they're killing the influence of
[23:27] brother brothers lashes because I've
[23:35] seen people do it you have to sit down
[23:37] for you're in you're out you're in
[23:38] school well I believe the probably the
[23:40] problems thus saith the Lord that bright
[23:41] eyes were the problem and then get one
[23:43] little bitty something got a wrong date
[23:45] somewhere that he's supposed to be
[23:47] hunting and they just believe the
[23:49] message don't tell me that person ever
[23:53] had anything don't tell me they had the
[23:57] Holy Ghost in law stick sorry I'm too
[24:02] old I haven't been around too long I
[24:06] don't fall too many battles on that
[24:13] the prophets Edward rejecters may I call
[24:17] him word rejecters where do they go
[24:22] somebody quoted somewhere I won't be me
[24:25] they go to hell
[24:28] word rejecters go to hell they have
[24:32] their reward they'll get what they do
[24:33] and with all of that but you're so sorry
[24:36] for them because they're they were so at
[24:40] one time so much on fire with a word and
[24:43] believing the word and then all at once
[24:45] this one the little thing and here's the
[24:47] other thing I don't get I can't
[24:49] understand it
[24:50] suppose you could prove brother Branham
[24:52] was wrong Super's I'm making a statement
[24:57] so listen suppose you could prove he was
[24:59] wrong why is it that the very instant
[25:05] anybody in this message that has went
[25:07] off the message and saying brother Brown
[25:10] was wrong
[25:11] what's the first thing they do come on
[25:15] they go to cutting their heart wiring
[25:17] their pants go back into the world now
[25:20] where would that be it regardless of
[25:24] what brother Branham is where would that
[25:26] put you and me to go back in
[25:30] you mean you say oh the word says may
[25:33] not cut my heart you know I will do it
[25:35] in one day well well we got to change
[25:37] that somewhere you know believe that why
[25:40] why is that why is it the first thing
[25:44] they do they go back to the world I mean
[25:48] if I was the congregation I'd ask that
[25:50] question they'd be a person brother I
[25:54] was wrong here but running on clay I
[25:55] think would you mind if I say a word why
[26:01] are you now teaching it's okay to cut
[26:03] your heart what's that got to do what
[26:04] brother Adam was right or not you check
[26:10] out all these doctors and see different
[26:12] if it's not solved what I say it then
[26:15] when they come with a doctrine as quick
[26:16] as a doctor gets embedded enough they go
[26:19] right back to the world that ain't even
[26:24] then ain't even common sense
[26:28] ain't no Christianity there at all I
[26:30] don't care what you say you're throwing
[26:32] off oh no no I'm telling it like it is
[26:35] okay now look get my point where we can
[26:41] get into the thought ever messenger the
[26:47] prophet said was to line up his message
[26:50] how I was that they all each one line
[26:54] their mess even in the church edges
[26:55] underline their message with the
[26:58] messenger previous right as to line up
[27:02] with a previous messenger and bring
[27:04] their message all right why because that
[27:07] was the way the word is sprung it's
[27:10] brought word by word line upon line
[27:13] precept upon precept you're a little and
[27:16] are a little I know little here and
[27:20] there
[27:20] it's just brought little at the time
[27:22] it's the way God brings it he brings us
[27:26] his message and all of them will tie
[27:29] together so if you could prove brother
[27:33] Branham was wrong in 90% yet you had a
[27:35] 10% ratio over here from some about it
[27:38] what are you gonna do
[27:43] you see where the trouble is gonna be
[27:46] one day is I'm gonna say this and then
[27:47] acquit you know where the biggest
[27:49] trouble is gonna be when those people
[27:51] face God and God looks down to them and
[27:55] says did the seals open it's all you got
[28:04] to say
[28:09] the seals opening prove the man was
[28:11] right humanely he made mistakes even in
[28:16] the seals he talked a white horse rider
[28:18] wrong well yet he corrected his own
[28:22] mistake are you with me of what I'm
[28:29] talking about
[28:31] see it's got to line up from Genesis to
[28:33] Revelation
[28:34] they gotta line up together it's not
[28:37] necessary that each one will have the
[28:39] understanding tells us the growth
[28:44] it's the difference in the way they're
[28:46] supposed to be ok let's get on with it
[28:49] seeing the message of adoption we talked
[28:52] about previous measurement preaching on
[28:55] how paul was explaining the natural
[28:59] story of adoption and how the son was
[29:04] adopted into the family and using that
[29:08] as how the child of God is brought into
[29:12] the family of God at the new birth and
[29:15] then progresses growth through the
[29:18] development of to comes to manifestation
[29:21] of sons and daughters of God
[29:25] alright see the journey of a Christian
[29:27] is covered in the example of a child how
[29:32] that that child goes through a new birth
[29:34] or a natural baby goes from natural
[29:36] birth and it goes into a adoption on
[29:41] stage over the natural alright now if
[29:46] that's going to line up straight then
[29:48] you're gonna have to line your scripture
[29:49] up there somewhere now here's what we're
[29:54] gonna have to thank for a while they're
[29:55] not you know that in the Old Testament
[30:07] the adopts you know point was cuz I'm
[30:11] talking about what brother Branham said
[30:12] about it cuz that's the way I knowed
[30:14] about it and what a little bit you can
[30:15] read a natural child is born into a
[30:19] natural family that's an example of a
[30:23] child being born into the body of Christ
[30:26] alright a natural child comes to a
[30:30] maturity stage more of its fire how you
[30:33] about that big ol word they come to that
[30:36] point all right but in the Old Testament
[30:42] where does it go any further
[30:50] no we got something here now let's hold
[30:55] on to it in the Old Testament
[31:00] it only went from the natural child
[31:02] being born into the natural family to an
[31:05] adoption 'el stage and come to an
[31:09] inheritance or a blessing whatever when
[31:16] it came to an inheritance
[31:20] but it never went on
[31:25] there's no more time
[31:31] okay
[31:39] keep that thought in mind now that that
[31:44] child when it was born in the family
[31:46] would automatically a child for the
[31:47] family and it went to the state of an
[31:50] adoption on point never went any further
[31:57] because that was the type of the shadow
[32:00] that was the inheritance it received it
[32:07] never received nothing as an example of
[32:12] the resurrection if it is I want it to
[32:18] be shown to me if it is I'll come here
[32:23] and tell you no problem I'm just saying
[32:28] think about the point all that Old
[32:33] Testament would do would pick up and
[32:35] show the child was a child and then show
[32:38] the inheritance to the child it never
[32:40] brought anything else into view hey what
[32:47] if I can prove that Paul went thattaway
[32:55] would we believe it
[33:00] then you'll see brother around saying
[33:02] Peter and Paul said the same thing what
[33:06] about it
[33:08] what are you trying to say brother Dale
[33:10] I'm trying to say one thing you only had
[33:13] two stages in the Old Testament you had
[33:15] the baby and you had the inheritance
[33:17] that stopped the typing because it would
[33:21] have to come to the New Testament to be
[33:23] able to pick that up to carry it any
[33:26] higher and I challenge you to find out
[33:30] Peter never taught resurrection on the
[33:37] statute of perfect man you need to
[33:43] listen well I don't understand what
[33:46] you're trying to get to so let's listen
[33:47] and see maybe the Lord might help us
[33:51] okay Paul when you first started out
[33:58] you've seemed to be holding back but
[34:01] then in the depth of your message as you
[34:04] progressed brother you seemed to go
[34:06] further would that not be scriptural is
[34:11] that not the way the Prophet brought it
[34:12] all right go ahead number one let's read
[34:15] something this is taken from Ephesians
[34:18] for he that descended is same also that
[34:22] ascended far above all the heavens that
[34:24] he might fill all in all and he gave
[34:26] some apostles and some prophets and some
[34:28] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[34:30] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[34:32] working of the work of the ministry for
[34:34] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[34:36] we all come in the unity of the faith of
[34:39] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[34:41] perfect man unto the measure of the
[34:44] stature
[34:46] of the fullness of Christ Peter never
[34:50] called it stature
[34:57] okay
[34:59] that we have for to be no more children
[35:01] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[35:04] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[35:06] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[35:08] lie in wait to deceive but speaking the
[35:11] truth in love may grow up into him in
[35:13] all things which is the head even Christ
[35:18] now Paul ver spoke off the new birth you
[35:25] know and then the stature of a perfect
[35:29] man the growth development but yet he
[35:35] precedes no further than growth
[35:38] development are we're gonna show what
[35:41] he'll pick up he just keeps picking up
[35:43] and the odd part is who he explains it
[35:46] to might be a little bit amazing when we
[35:51] get to there all right well now Paul you
[35:57] believe that we are we've got to come to
[36:00] the perfecting of the science where I've
[36:03] come to the basis of the measure of the
[36:06] stature of the fullness of Christ they
[36:08] will henceforth be no more children okay
[36:11] now Peter did you teach that like that
[36:17] if Paul the Peter Thomas signs I now
[36:19] Peter did you teach it like that okay go
[36:24] ahead to number two second Peter one in
[36:30] 108 one day Simon Peter served an
[36:33] apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[36:35] have obtained like precious faith we'll
[36:37] get back to that okay right rotor run
[36:40] said they had that same faith all right
[36:43] with us through the garage system of God
[36:45] in our Savior Jesus Christ in other
[36:47] words Paul had to sign faith Peter had
[36:49] Peter had the same faith Paul okay grace
[36:52] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[36:54] the knowledge of garden of Jesus our
[36:56] Lord according as his divine power has
[36:58] given unto us all things that pertain
[36:59] unto life and godliness through the
[37:01] knowledge of him that have called us to
[37:03] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[37:05] us exceeding great and precious promises
[37:06] that by these you might be partakers of
[37:09] the divine nature
[37:12] haven't escaped the corruption that is
[37:14] in the world talking to a born-again or
[37:17] about a born-again believer Bible watch
[37:19] and beside this giving all diligence add
[37:22] to your faith virtue the virtual
[37:23] knowledge the knowledge temperance
[37:25] temperance patience places godliness
[37:27] guarding this brotherly kindness and to
[37:30] brotherly kindness charity for these
[37:33] things be in you and abound they make
[37:36] you that you shall be neither barren nor
[37:38] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[37:41] Jesus Christ now the next verse after
[37:43] then you might ought to read it verse 9
[37:46] cuz it says this he that lacketh these
[37:49] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[37:51] and I've forgotten he was purged from
[37:54] his old sins that's what the Bible says
[37:56] okay
[37:57] now aren't into this into what I'm
[37:59] saying
[38:00] Paul you took it and brought a birth in
[38:05] Ephesians to the Ephesians and you
[38:07] brought it into manifestation as we'll
[38:10] call it which he called it the stature
[38:11] of a perfect man just four four points
[38:15] of our understanding he brought it to
[38:16] teaching a manifestation of sons and
[38:18] daughters of God Peter goes to his
[38:22] message the in Peter and he teaches the
[38:27] stature of a perfect man and he brings
[38:29] it up and talks about
[38:34] but love but he could never come into
[38:38] that because the probably said the
[38:41] headstone didn't come all right now
[38:44] pilot Peters both saying the same thing
[38:46] they got two things in mind
[38:48] number one they got a new birth a child
[38:53] of God like the Old Testament a child
[38:55] born into the family then they've got an
[38:58] inheritance the child the Old Testament
[39:02] got an inheritance but it stopped there
[39:04] because nothing else was mentioned of
[39:07] resurrections or anything to the Old
[39:09] Testament because that was not meant to
[39:11] be it was meant to be in our day in time
[39:13] all right
[39:14] see Peter Cullen Paul comes along takes
[39:17] it up to the stature of a perfect man
[39:20] you don't mention the change you don't
[39:27] mention the redemption of the body Peter
[39:31] comes along comes to the new birth they
[39:35] look like precious faith and he brings
[39:38] it up through a growth development out
[39:40] into the stature of a perfect man but he
[39:42] stops
[39:45] even if you want to talk about the
[39:47] headstone but he stops prior to the
[39:51] resurrection in that odd or is it odd
[39:57] that you're exactly fitting the Old
[40:00] Testament example baby majority Peter
[40:08] baby maturity Paul baby majority
[40:19] now
[40:29] Paul does a marvelous thing then he
[40:35] picks up his talk and he goes to the
[40:39] Romans with his thought watch him come
[40:43] up and he just keeps traveling he never
[40:47] stops
[40:48] he just keeps advancing watch it now you
[40:53] get what I'm saying the Old Testament
[40:55] you had the advancement for one cop of a
[40:57] child and inheritance Paul you had it in
[41:02] a child and inheritance
[41:04] Peter you had a child inheritance it
[41:09] didn't bring out the redemption of the
[41:10] body at that point but now let's listen
[41:12] to the Apostle Paul as he comes back and
[41:15] takes it home let's go to number three
[41:19] on you which is Romans eight as many as
[41:23] are led by the Spirit of God they are
[41:25] the sons of God okay children born into
[41:30] the family and you have not received the
[41:33] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[41:35] have received the spirit of adoption
[41:36] whereby we cry I thought the spirit of
[41:40] adoption
[41:42] it says it's this holy spirit to adopt
[41:45] us into the family to make us children
[41:47] make us sons and daughters of God right
[41:51] come on now the spirit itself beareth
[41:55] witness with our spirit that we are the
[41:57] children of God and if children then
[41:59] heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with
[42:01] Christ what a wonderful place Paul puts
[42:03] it if so be that we suffer with him that
[42:06] we may be also glorified together
[42:08] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[42:11] present time are not worthy to be
[42:13] compared with the glory which shall be
[42:15] revealed in us for the earnest
[42:18] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[42:21] the manifestation of the sons of God now
[42:24] he's right to the point of him where he
[42:25] was when he started in Ephesians 2 the
[42:30] stature of a perfect man he's right
[42:33] where Peter brings it up through faith
[42:35] virtue knowledge temperance place they
[42:37] don't know that's the same pleasure then
[42:44] the Apostle Paul doesn't stop where the
[42:47] creature was made subject to vanity not
[42:48] willingly but by reason of him with
[42:50] subjected the same in hope because the
[42:52] treasure itself also shall be delivered
[42:54] from the bondage of corruption into the
[42:56] glorious liberty of the children of God
[42:58] well we know that the whole creation
[42:59] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[43:02] until now not only they but ourselves
[43:08] even him where he was in his standings
[43:14] he stood in a great position we'll look
[43:16] at it even we ourselves groan within
[43:18] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[43:25] wit the redemption of the body now watch
[43:28] what you've got you've got the Old
[43:30] Testament Saint Old Testament people
[43:32] with a baby and an inheritance
[43:35] you've got Paul and Peter both starting
[43:38] off as a new birth and bringing it to
[43:40] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[43:42] God our stature of a perfect man Paul
[43:45] and Peter both now Paul takes it on he
[43:50] carries it on to redemption of the body
[43:59] you say well that doesn't mean anything
[44:00] to me but it sure does to me it sure
[44:06] means a lot to me because that little
[44:11] word are waiting for the adoption to wit
[44:15] means to understand or to know you've
[44:20] got many meanings of it as users in
[44:22] eleven or twelve times in the Bible of
[44:24] wit and it's used you know for smart in
[44:26] this search use for them but the main
[44:28] thing to me is to a Christian is what to
[44:31] adoption to understand if you think that
[44:37] ain't correct I'll be glad to read it to
[44:39] you
[44:41] we're in the Old Testament the Hebrew
[44:43] word is to know to know to know learn to
[44:47] know to perceive to perceive and see
[44:51] that's the word we'll find out and all
[44:55] the things the New Testament Greek is to
[44:59] make known declare certify give to
[45:02] understand to make known to become known
[45:09] be recognized to know to gain knowledge
[45:13] of that choice to understand coming to
[45:21] an understanding that now there's a
[45:25] bodily Redemption involved
[45:32] now he's come into a resurrection
[45:39] he's coming to a place to talk about a
[45:42] third stage stage one baby born into the
[45:47] family
[45:48] Stage two manifestation statue of a
[45:54] perfect man playing stage three now
[45:57] we're at the redemption of the body with
[46:00] the same messenger bringing it yet he
[46:03] keeps going to grope development if you
[46:07] don't read brother runs the message out
[46:08] of way or listen to you in bad shape
[46:10] anyway because he looked like back here
[46:12] he's he just looks like he ain't getting
[46:14] in there just right and he keeps on
[46:16] going and the next time you hear him
[46:18] bring that message he goes up brings a
[46:20] little higher then the next time you
[46:21] hear it it takes a little higher next
[46:22] time you hear the state it just keeps
[46:24] raising why because he's getting
[46:26] understanding all right now Paul you
[46:33] come to the redemption of the body no
[46:41] did you say any more about this in your
[46:46] writing
[46:48] did you talk any more about the things
[46:51] that are dire that we could take an
[46:54] example of and be able to follow okay go
[47:01] ahead and number six
[47:06] and immediately look at who it's to
[47:15] it's not to the Galatians the Ephesians
[47:19] it's to the babies in Christ the
[47:24] Corinthians because he knows that's his
[47:29] height that he can go he has taken it to
[47:34] the Ephesians and Galatians and they
[47:36] understand that he's reached the point
[47:40] of talking about the redemption the
[47:45] resurrection in other words we'll put it
[47:47] that way but remember now before you can
[47:52] take what we'll get to in a minute we're
[47:53] talking about changing the moment Winco
[47:55] and i just remember you've got to have
[47:57] the dead raised in first
[48:00] right before you talk about the change
[48:04] on so Paul what are you doing well I've
[48:10] had an opportunity I'm talking now to
[48:12] the Corinthians and that's called the
[48:15] book of Corrections brother Brennan said
[48:18] that Paul had more trouble with the
[48:20] Corinthians than anybody he said there's
[48:23] just a bunch of babies
[48:27] but he said that's the way we were right
[48:31] remember what we sprang another day ever
[48:34] born-again believer starts as a baby
[48:38] okay
[48:39] now let's read this some man say how are
[48:46] the dead raised up Paul
[48:50] you're gonna start talking about the
[48:52] dead being raised you haven't spoken of
[48:55] this to the Corinthians you only
[48:59] mentioned it to the Ephesians and the
[49:01] Galatians what are you doing are the
[49:06] dead raised and what body do they come
[49:09] in that this sensibly the baby
[49:12] Corinthians we don't know Paul said
[49:14] something about isn't it but what's it
[49:17] going to be are we gonna play it raised
[49:19] up this way he's looking raised up that
[49:21] way babies they get their doctrine and
[49:24] ideas it's like the believers and this
[49:27] message is done okay you know look what
[49:30] he says thou fool that was our source is
[49:35] not quickened except it da he said now
[49:39] listen to me I'm gonna explain to you
[49:40] the resurrection I'm gonna explain to
[49:44] you the dead and then I'll get to the
[49:46] resurrection to come forth that was our
[49:51] source the source not the body this
[49:53] shall be the bar grain it may chance of
[49:57] wheat or whether the grain know
[49:58] yourselves just a natural into the
[50:00] spiritual right listen well God giveth
[50:03] to the body as it hath pleased him and
[50:05] to ever see this own body our flesh is
[50:08] not the same flesh but there's one kind
[50:10] of flesh of men another flesh of beasts
[50:13] and another fishes and the birds
[50:16] there are also celestial bodies and
[50:18] bodies terrestrial but the glory of the
[50:21] celestial is one and the glory of the
[50:24] terrestrial is another you have natural
[50:27] bodies spiritual bodies you have the
[50:29] natural terrestrial and then you have
[50:32] the celestial which is spiritual body
[50:35] which is so theophany etc
[50:39] you know coming for this there is one
[50:42] glory of the Sun another glory of the
[50:44] moon
[50:45] another glory of the stars the one star
[50:47] different from another and glory
[50:49] so also is the resurrection of the Dead
[50:52] ooh it is sown in corruption now it does
[51:01] not mean that it's sown in sin it says
[51:05] in corruption in other words the body is
[51:08] going to corrupt are you with Paul the
[51:12] body is going to corrupt not that it's a
[51:15] sinful body
[51:16] okay now you follow me in this song in
[51:21] this honor oh it's your raising in
[51:23] corruption it is sown in dishonor oh
[51:25] that's what its gonna do it's gonna be
[51:26] changed it is sown in dishonor it is
[51:30] raised in glory because it's a dishonor
[51:32] to the fact that we and I should never
[51:33] had it we shouldn't had to die to start
[51:35] with
[51:36] that's a dishonor to the whole human
[51:37] race we went after so much sin until we
[51:40] wound up having to die for come on it is
[51:43] sown a natural body it is raised a
[51:45] spiritual body there's a natural body
[51:47] and there's a spiritual body so it is
[51:49] written the first man Adam was made a
[51:51] living soul the last man Adam was made a
[51:55] quickening spirit first man Adam was
[51:59] made a living being the second Adam
[52:03] which is Jesus Christ right now come on
[52:06] wasn't made a quickening spirit howbeit
[52:08] that was not first which is spiritual
[52:11] but that which is natural and afterward
[52:13] that which is spiritual so you see which
[52:16] way is coming the first man is of the
[52:18] earth earthy the second man is the Lord
[52:20] from heaven as is the earthy so are they
[52:24] also that are earthy and as is the
[52:27] heavenly sort they also that are
[52:29] heavenly as we have borne the image of
[52:33] the earthly earthy we shall also bear
[52:35] the image of the heavenly now this I say
[52:38] brethren watch him
[52:43] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[52:46] kingdom of God
[52:48] flesh and blood cannot inherit that's
[52:53] why you've got to be changed but it's
[52:56] this body change it's not this body
[52:59] throw it away and burnt now they help
[53:01] but see come on are you right
[53:04] flesh and blood came in hurt the kingdom
[53:11] because it's got to be changed it's got
[53:16] to go by the grave gotta come out gotta
[53:17] beat you now this I say brethren that
[53:19] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[53:20] kingdom neither does corruption inherit
[53:22] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[53:28] now he just got through set up here
[53:31] all's got to die all the lives got to
[53:34] die come on
[53:38] blessing blood Canaan hurt the kingdom
[53:40] all that's died in sin cannot be in
[53:46] glory in that state are you with me
[53:49] you don't go to heaven with a sinful
[53:52] body it's got to be changed but you
[53:58] don't go there with a different body cuz
[54:00] it ain't change that much it's change
[54:05] from one state to the other
[54:06] there was behold I show you a mystery
[54:11] now he's fixing to explain to the
[54:13] Corinthians that they're not all even if
[54:17] they're dying they're not wrong or not
[54:20] in bad shape right he's fixin to explain
[54:24] that if they dive that don't mean it's
[54:26] wrong with no problem listen to it I'll
[54:30] show you a mystery we shall not all
[54:32] sleep which we shall all be changed
[54:36] until there comes a point of a change of
[54:39] the body you and I are going to keep
[54:42] dying but it don't mean we're dying in
[54:45] in corruption we're dying in Christ
[54:52] because there's no in corruption in
[54:55] anything in Christ right then what well
[55:00] we should all be changed in a moment in
[55:02] a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[55:05] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[55:07] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[55:10] shall be changed so it's not gonna it's
[55:14] not a bad thing if I die don't worry
[55:17] about it I've always made the comical
[55:19] part about it and always said it oh is
[55:21] this said if I died this told me I don't
[55:23] side rope I won't have to worry about
[55:25] digging myself out later he said that's
[55:28] silly not a silly but that's this way I
[55:30] am ain't worried about it because this
[55:33] here is going to follow what's inside of
[55:35] here marry a future home the body is
[55:40] reading let's know the soul is redeemed
[55:43] 49 soul is redeemed you're waiting the
[55:47] redemption of the body that's what we're
[55:49] all doing right now wherever one waiting
[55:52] the redemption of the body right come on
[55:57] I hope we'll get to that point in a
[56:00] minute but it'll slip away for this
[56:03] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[56:05] this mortal must put on immortality it's
[56:08] got to happen it's gonna come forth
[56:10] it can't be come forth in a wrong thing
[56:12] you ain't gonna raise up a they ain't
[56:15] gonna be limbs missing and in parts gone
[56:17] and things like that
[56:20] but you're gonna have the same body you
[56:23] said when I live I got a limb missing so
[56:25] when I get there I'll have a limb
[56:27] missing no that's what Paul said it's
[56:31] not gonna be that away it's going to be
[56:34] changed but this corruptible must put on
[56:40] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[56:42] immortality
[56:43] now resurrection Paul something Peter
[56:47] didn't explain Peter I'll get to it
[56:50] later Peter and Paul says the same thing
[56:54] Paul tells you scripturally etc
[56:58] encouraged you through the lining up of
[57:00] the scriptures Peter takes you through
[57:02] the gaining of that point of the virtues
[57:05] into display right now come on for this
[57:13] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[57:15] this mortal must put on immortality so
[57:17] when this corruptible shall have put on
[57:23] incorruption
[57:24] when this dead that goes by the grave
[57:27] this rotting thing that goes in the
[57:28] grave yeah when it's brought forth
[57:31] changed it stands again on earth
[57:34] watching so when this see and this
[57:38] mortal must put on immortality so when
[57:40] this corruptible shall have put on
[57:41] incorruption and this mortal shall have
[57:43] put on immortality then shall be brought
[57:46] to pass the saying
[57:50] that saying cannot be brought to faisal
[57:53] until somebody gets to a change in
[57:54] resurrection and all comes back but look
[57:57] ice has written death is swallowed up in
[58:00] victory Oh death where is thy sting
[58:06] grave words I victory a sting of death
[58:11] is sin and the strength of sin is the
[58:13] law in other words we die we thought if
[58:16] everything goes but thanks be to God
[58:18] which give us the victory through our
[58:20] Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[58:22] brethren be a steadfast unmovable always
[58:24] abounding in the work of the Lord for as
[58:26] much as you know that your Labor's are
[58:29] not in vain in the Lord
[58:31] Paul takes it in the illustration the
[58:38] Old Testament takes it from a baby and
[58:40] the natural story puts him into the
[58:43] family he comes forth as an inheritance
[58:46] part but that ends his journey part
[58:48] because he's only topping that much Paul
[58:53] and Peter both pick it up in the point
[58:56] of the newborn baby born into the family
[58:59] and the manifestation of the sons and
[59:02] daughters of God going into the stature
[59:05] of a perfect man
[59:08] but at those stages they don't mention
[59:10] resurrection you know why cuz they don't
[59:20] have the resurrection message you say
[59:21] right now wait a minute let's don't
[59:23] misunderstand me there you hold on to
[59:25] what I'm saying see this message is the
[59:31] resurrection message because this
[59:34] message does what no the rest of them
[59:36] could do remember remember now remember
[59:41] the story what a broad eye that
[59:44] everybody in the Bible what they've
[59:46] taught has got to tie together they
[59:50] can't be contrary one to the other
[59:52] they've got to interlace each other to
[59:55] bring forth the revelation of Jesus
[59:57] Christ
[59:57] whereas one brought it up so far the
[1:00:00] other one takes it home whereas this one
[1:00:02] shows it in an example this one carries
[1:00:04] it home right he's in Old Testament goes
[1:00:10] from a baby to an inheritance Paul picks
[1:00:14] it up
[1:00:14] Peter picks it up it goes from a baby
[1:00:16] born into the family
[1:00:20] to a rightful inheritance of the new
[1:00:24] birth coming forth in manifestation of
[1:00:26] sons and daughters of God Romans 8 then
[1:00:33] Paul says okay we've got this going so
[1:00:37] far now let me continue on and he covers
[1:00:44] to wit the understand the redemption of
[1:00:49] the body then the Corinthians questioned
[1:00:53] him he spent a lengthy process of
[1:00:59] explaining what death is it's taking you
[1:01:05] away it's in corrupt you know it's its
[1:01:10] incorruptible I'm excuse me its
[1:01:12] corruptible death brings corruption but
[1:01:17] he says now through Jesus Christ we go
[1:01:19] to in corruption we go to in corruption
[1:01:26] because his body went through right
[1:01:33] just remember we've got some more to go
[1:01:36] so hold your point remember Jesus went
[1:01:41] through death burial resurrection change
[1:01:45] ascension we still got a lot to go yeah
[1:01:52] we've only got about three stages
[1:01:54] working on am i right
[1:01:56] I know I used to believe I used to
[1:02:02] believe that nobody had ever because the
[1:02:04] Bible says no man had reached
[1:02:05] immortality but Jesus Christ and I even
[1:02:08] put Jesus Christ to the basis that you
[1:02:10] had never been brought to the correct
[1:02:12] point I'm just kidding I'm not telling
[1:02:15] you what the Lord spoke to me one day
[1:02:17] cesky Ryan
[1:02:20] the Lord Jesus went through death he's
[1:02:24] got a face every one of these things for
[1:02:26] you and me death resurrection change
[1:02:35] ascension what was the other battle
[1:02:38] everyone out there someone death burial
[1:02:41] he went through death burial
[1:02:42] resurrection he faced every one of those
[1:02:45] things and conquered every one of them
[1:02:48] okay all you and I got to do is just
[1:02:52] keep following the plan just keep
[1:02:56] following the plan keep walking in the
[1:02:58] word God will give us the answer to all
[1:03:03] kind but remember it'll be in the world
[1:03:07] who would have thought now honest I'm
[1:03:09] telling it like I'm sorry I just human
[1:03:12] but who would have thought the
[1:03:14] Corinthians is the one's Paul was
[1:03:16] explaining it to little Adam said in the
[1:03:22] Ephesians they had tongues and
[1:03:24] interpretation he said but it didn't
[1:03:26] have to be explained to them Corinthians
[1:03:29] that over and over about tongues and
[1:03:31] interpretations and gifts like he said
[1:03:33] the Corinthians had him I mean the
[1:03:34] seasons had him in order of Galatians
[1:03:37] one of the two he said they had him in
[1:03:38] order they were tutored and trained and
[1:03:48] they came forth walking in the word this
[1:03:53] message has the answer to all things
[1:04:04] and everybody's waiting on you and huh
[1:04:14] the because this is the day this is the
[1:04:16] time but they're waiting on you and I
[1:04:27] a change of the body let's see the
[1:04:30] resurrections got to come before the
[1:04:32] puck those that are alive and remain
[1:04:34] she'll be changed
[1:04:35] so resurrection is our next point and
[1:04:39] we're about rapturous change we're about
[1:04:42] to Resurrection those resurrections next
[1:04:48] in the order of events goes resurrection
[1:04:50] and then change and ascension we go to
[1:04:57] meet him in the air but he's done been
[1:05:00] through all these things so he knows how
[1:05:03] to go what all we got to do this let him
[1:05:05] take over in our hearts and a lot
