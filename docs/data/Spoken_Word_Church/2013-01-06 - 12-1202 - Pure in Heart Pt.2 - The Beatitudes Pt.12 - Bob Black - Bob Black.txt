========================================

never heard that before have you all right we are live so we've been going that's Bob's brother yeah this is my brother if y'all hadn't met being before younger baby brother small child special guest he's the baby yeah Special he's special so we have been going through the Beatitudes and we are on the blessed are the p and heart they shall see God and last time we kind of started going through uh we we reviewed blessed are the poor in spirit we we I'm just kind of quickly go over these um blessed are the poor in spirit for those is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are that the mor blessed are the Meek um and we're blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God and we talked about being pure in heart is having uh pure motives not anything to uh not Desiring your own motives not Desiring to to things of the world like uh we talked about people that desire or you know preachers that desire money or things like that and they're they're not motivated by Purity then when God comes in and fills you with the Holy Ghost and he cleanses you and begins to uh begins to open the word to you and um shall seek God and you know brother Ram talked about in uh many sermons about show us the father and it'll suffice us and and uh many sermons that he preached he he walked down this U how we can see God in his Universe in his word in his son and then in his people and we kind of talked about last time how you can see God in the the in everything around you in the universe when you look up at the stars at night you can see God and the Ancients when they would look up into the sky they would they would be aware of one star that was out of place if any if anything was abnormal then uh something they knew something uh was they they could identify it and I I believe that's how we should be when we're we're reading the word when we're we're studying if if everything should be just perfectly fall in line because there's not you know when you're reading God's word and you think one thing is out of place and it doesn't tie together it all fits together like a perfect puzzle amen everything if if there's if you got the the uh like that story brother R told about about the puzzle the painting if you got the cow in the sky or the clouds on the ground or something it's not right and that's how the Ancients looked up in this the night sky and they could see that story the story of that we now read in our Bible told in the stars and this whole story is told this this uh God revealing himself is told in John 1 so let's turn to Big John 1 and um kind of look at how John expresses this condescending down from God in his Universe God in his word God and his son and then God and his people and this this whole story is is the the idea behind it is God wanted himself to be known that when you read your word and you think well uh sometime I remember just in my Christian experience you kind of get frustrated sometimes and I can't understand this but God just rest knowing that God is is God will open it up to you if you keep if you're patient and you're diligent and keep studying now John 1 one oh I'm on first John I was actually going to go there in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that that's talking about God revealing himself because he wanted to be made known he wanted us to see him and the only way for us to see him is for him to be made manifest in his son that brother Brown talked about that little Loos that came spinning out out back in the beginning and uh in the Old Testament remember when uh the the king of the Babylon was it darus or uh the one that when the four Hebrew children were cast Into the Fire he looked down and he said uh the three Hebrew children he said I see four in there and one of them is like the Son of God because he knew even he knew that if I could see God it would have to be the son right to make manifest God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made we know that we talked about the how the four gospels present Jesus in Christ in four different ways and and John presents him as John the eagle presents him as God this whole gospel is presenting God Jesus as not just somebody that was born in a manger but he was from the beginning all things were made by him when you look up in the night sky now I think it's is interesting that when you look up into the night sky there's not one star that you can see that's not in the Milky Way think consider how big how vast the universe is with your naked eye you can only perceive the stars that are in in the Milky Way then you when you open up a telescope when you look through a telescope you can begin to see things that are even beyond our galaxy and God just open he continuously opens up his word when when you look through the eyes of the Prophet this prophet's message you can see out so so far through that eagle anointing in him was life and the life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from John sent from God whose name was John the same for witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to Bear witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world and uh just all through scripture you see types of Light how in the beginning when in in creation when God first the world was in darkness speaking of uh that you can see your own Christian experience in the Genesis 1 creation how first you were in darkness and then God uh brought light and separated the light from the darkness in your life and and and then John came to testify that the light this light was coming that he knew it was coming and and uh moving on down then we are lights that should not be hid under a bushel that God put his light in us that was the True Light which lith every man that come cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was by him and the world knew him not because they couldn't see him they weren't looking for him they couldn't perceive him he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth brother Brown talked about how you can see God in word when you read your the Bible and uh you agree with the word believe it what the word says then you can rest on that and know that God will bring it to pass like Exodus 15:26 I am the Lord that Health thee and all the promises throughout the scripture about God being Our Redeemer and and the promise that this this promise is to us and to our children not just to us that we can rest on those promises because God is in his word to fulfill it John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I speak he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me not just he didn't begin just at the manger but he was before me he was he he he was the beginning of he he you know he was the beginning the Alpha and the Omega and of his fullness have we have all we received and Grace for grace for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ no man ha seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he ha declared him and then keep on coming down God and his people he was the the son but we are the a son to declare him to God coming and putting his attributes in us to declare him just like Jesus did no and this is the record of John where the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed I am not the Christ and they asked him what then art thou elas and he saith I am not art thou that prophet and he answered no then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself we were talking about uh uh our our our role in in this plan and John knew who he was and what we was he was sent for he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah cuz the the word is the expression of of the attributes of God and the word has a voice John the word was declared in John and they which were sent with were of the Pharisees and they asked him and said unto him why baptized thou then if thou be not that Christ nor lies neither that prophet and let's uh skip on down so what I'm getting at where we're going God in his Universe God in his word God in his his son he came to declare all of his fullness in his son so that we could see him so that they could in John first John 1:1 uh John said we we have handled him with our own hands we handled him when we saw him we heard him and in job 45 I think it's 452 he said I heard with my ears but now I seeth with my eye with his eye and we talked about let your eye be single the eye of your soul that that can uh to P to see the things of God and maybe job never actually saw like Saul Jesus or or saw God walking before him he could see see with the eye of his heart right the uh word being open and that's how uh you know we sing that song Open the Eyes of My Heart now John uh John had disciples and he preached he he taught them that one day this Messiah was going to come and they uh they wanted to see for their own for themselves and so they were waiting expecting to see for their eyes to be open and they they could not perceive they couldn't they couldn't discern who what from all among all the people that were coming down to the river Jordan who was it that would that would be the Messiah and there was two disciples Andrew and John and one day John and his disciples were walking and Jesus passed by and there and John pointed them to the word just like brother Brandon pointed us to open our eyes to see God in his word and he said there there he is and John and Andrew looked and immediately they went and followed him and they went and asked him where do you dwell and uh we can go into that how they they wanted to abide where he was where where do you dwell they didn't ask him immediately what his Doctrine was but they asked him where do you dwell and they went and they stayed till the 10th hour because they could see God they began to see God and his son and then the process continues on God here in his people I just wanted to read first John 1:1 real quick where John said that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was man ested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us and now it's manifested in us and this last one is maybe the hardest one to see it's so hard to see God and his people remember the next chapter on the third day Jesus went to the wedding supper and there was six Stone pots and they they he told the servants to put water in the pots and you know it's said TI the Holy Ghost there was six empty pots that the wedding supper had was empty of all of their Joy right this the stimulation of Revelation that comes from the wine of God's revealed word and they put water in the pots and the the servants put the water in the pots and to anybody else looking upon it Jesus never said Jesus never said let the water become wine he never declared let the water become wine to to the to just someone observing it was the servant that turned the water into wine that's what it looked like from the outside but behind the scenes it was God that turned the water into wine God hearing his people you look upon the outward and from the outward appearance it looks like it might look like nothing's happening but behind the scenes on the inside God Is quickening Us and making us his manifested word hallelujah now uh this is in Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 brother brand and you know you could start talking about the three-fold uh pieces of the seventh seal and but this this is what the brother R talked about the threefold purpose of God's plan down Through the Ages first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence is by this in his church which is his body the bride till he can have the preeminence to express himself through them and thoroughly to restore the kingdom to his right position so just all down through scriptures you can see God descending down to reveal himself and his people and we read this last time if you want to see God in his Universe get him on the inside if you get him on the inside then you can see him everywhere you he opens up your heart to see God where others can't and we talked about you know when the Ancients looked at Aries uh how if unless except by Revelation how would you see Aries in this little it's not even a shape it's just one line but only by Revelation and uh how the on the third day the second chapter we were just talking about on the third day God uh fil turned the water into wine and we are the third planet on the third day life came on the earth so last time we were looking through the stars and we read through uh how you can see God in his Universe we read some of these scriptures about um God made Arcus Orion and plees he named these stars and they had special meanings any little move meant some spiritual significance it just like when we read the word anything out of place uh there's something wrong with our Revelation if we can't put everything together in its place and uh we talked last time about um how there there are great ages where every thousand years or so the the sun moves into begins in a new constellation but every year the sun moves each month into a new constellation and uh you know brother random talked about how we're in can Cancer and Pisces and and some of these things I honestly can't put together rightly and but um the the the line the path of the sun through the constellations uh tells a story that the ancients could look before the first word was even written in the Bible and uh we don't look to the Stars today to for our Bible because the same story is magnified in this Bible amen so if you want to look at uh find out what the Virgo means now you can look in here and see Isaiah wrote about how a virgin will conceive and you can look and read in in Luke 1 about how the uh how Mary said be it unto me according to to Thy word so the story that was told in part in the stars that something was going to take place it now magnified it was magnified a little bit in the in in the pyramid and and then it will became even greater in the written bible and we talked about how the an ancient the ancient Egyptian temple in is has the reading instructions that you read it from the Virgin to the lion and um so in this last little bit we looked at how Virgo we're we're looking at the ancient the how the Ancients named called these the stars in the constellations and the names of the stars tells us the meaning of each of these constellations Virgo has the name of the Stars the branch the Messiah um who shall come down it has four constellations that are part of it called coma the woman and child the Desir of all Nations and uh Libra the weighing Redemption now in the Old Testament the the handwriting on the wall said you weigh in the balance and found warning but our price has been paid by the blood of the lamb and that's that's the story now uh there's uh the Stars just like the Bible has sometimes it has many different meanings so you can look at these constellations and see maybe a natural like what what constellation you're born under might have a natural an influence on what kind of person you're going to be uh but I I can't explain that um so if you ask me what uh you know they say if you're born under Aries then you uh you don't like to be told what to do um and I I can't expl looking at the people at work there's a there's a lot of people that I work with that are not born under Aries and they also don't like to be told pretty much covered everybody uh so so what I'm focusing on is the story of of redemption in the Stars not um and you know uh if you you you can almost focus on that too much all of my problems I I don't want to look into the Stars to find out what my problems because this word tells me how to to mortify the problems of the Flesh and uh you know if you have a good every morning get up and read your Bible at night or in the morning spend time with God then over time the flesh will be more and more mortified that's right and you'll become uh just buried deep down inside him Scorpio the conflict the attack of the enemy there's a deep red star at the beginning entireties that means the wounding and there's a star in the tail of L that means the perverse uh it's the star and the stinger and there there's constellations in Scorpio serpents in o fukus the struggle with the am remember OAS is the one wrestling with the serpent and OAS has his foot on the on the Scorpion now Hercules the mighty one there's ofus wrestling with the serpent stepping on the Scorpion Sagittarius the redeemer's Triumph the beauty of the coming forth the gracious one the going or sending forth pray there's four constellations praise for the Conqueror the heart the altar fire prepare prepared for his enemies and the Zodiac of dendas a man with a flail of his hand and drape of the Dragon cast down and he's curled around Ursa Minor I want to talk briefly about that in a second and each of there's four sets remember we talked about there's three sets of constellations 4 4 and four MH and yeah that's right that makes 12 and they each end with the defeat of the serpent of the Dragon the first book ends with a defeat of Dr of the Dragon the second book ends with SE just the sea monster bound the third book ends with Hydra the old serpent destroyed then book two the redeemed the sacrifice slain capricornus the slay that's what the stars mean the constellations in capricornus or saga the arrow sent forth Aquilla the eagle wounded delphinus the dolphin Rising these these these are just symbols the eagle gave his life for us and then he rose again delus and and then uh Aquarius the place of him coming down and numbers uh it's written he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many Waters in Isaiah 44:3 for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I remember Peter reped from The Prophet Joel on the day of Pentecost I will pour my spirit out on All Flesh and the star s Al Malik the record of the pouring out and another one called the PO out and the constellations and Aquarius or Pisces austris of stream Pegasus Who goeth and returneth sth the Bless The Returning I gave this PowerPoint to brother Joe so he's going to print it out if anybody wants a copy of it just kind of think about um Pisces the fishes of him that cometh the Stars the United the upheld uh the constellations of the band The Andromeda the chain woman C sopus the Redeemer coming to R Rule and Isaiah it's written sh thyself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus sayith the Lord you have sold yourselves for not and ye shall be redeemed without money and then Aries T the lamb and and the stars in the constellation elth the slain and alaran the wounded and uh the constellations that are around in part of Aries copia the enthroned woman the freed SE us the great enemy Brown and Perseus the breaker and then book three the last four conversations taus in Hebrew means sure ruling the stars that make it up are Al debron the governor eln wounded palum belonging to the judge the ples the congregation of the judge which in the syc means Buddhist Feast of the Tabernacles the highes the congregated the congregated the constellations and taus or Orion Light breaking forth which in aadia means the light of Heaven eridanus the river flows from Orion's feet Orga the shepherd let's take a look at Orion cuz I think this is one of the most easy to spot constellations it's got these three stars right in the middle to make up ayan's belt and this is his shoulders and these are his knees and he's got his sword raised up over his head the bringer of light when you read the Bible and he opens it up to you think about Orion open up up your word to open up his word to you and uh there's a a lot of people look at the pyramids and remember the pyramid was the next coming on down the Bible was the the stars in the heaven with the first Bible then the pyramid a succession and then the the third was that the written word that came by the god in men and if you look up in the night sky the pyramids kind of make the same uh matched Orion's Belt this is the Great Pyramid and the other two pyramids fit this is actually a photograph of the Orion's belt superimposed on the um the pyramids and they it it seems to match up pretty good and book three Gemini a woman now um Gemini is uh a man and a woman and in the Coptic it means they're United mhm United together mhm uh the star Apollo the ruler the judge waset the set adira the seed the constellations in Gemini are L leus the enemy trodden underfoot Sirius Christ and his Royal Court proon the Redeemer and the redeem that's right United under his blood cancer is aradian now in the dendera Z zodiac the claws are not claw crab claws but human hands holding us uh in uban The Hiding Place and mala means they assembled thousands PRI prpe means Offspring Al himring the Lambs sheltered in the hiding place and the constellations that make up cancer are Ursa Minor now remember Ursa Minor is the one that the serpent had its tail wrapped around and Ursa Major is uh the the redeem the the the the little sheep that that are protected and Argo the ship um and then uh Leo the last one Leo now um you know if you if you reject brother Brown talked about how if you reject the Lamb's offering what he had done for us and turn it down then he'll Mercy always follows judgment and uh Leo represent look at these an Egyptian the name was pouring out the name of in Hebrew it's the lion hunting prey and syc rening lion and the stars that make it up are cor lenois the heart of the lion regulus treading underfoot denoa the judge who cometh zosma shining for men alasa Arabic the punishing theb Al the judge cometh who seizes alah the enemy put down and the constellations that make up Le are Hider the serpent Creator the cup corus the crow Birds of Prey and then the breach between the seven Church AES and the Seven Seals brother R said he leaves the throne to be an intercessor of a slain lamb to be a lion king to bring the world to judgment who is rejected his message he's not a mediator remember the Old Testament teaching now as we heard when the blood went off The Mercy Seat what was it judgment seat and when the lamb slain walked forward from eternity out of the father's throne and took his rights it was a judgment seat then eny come not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his Queen to come stand by his side and uh I just put this in the PowerPoint if you get a copy from Joe all L this came from this book Francis Rolston in the 1800s did a lot of research and on the names of these stars and wrote a book called maero so um we ended right at 10 10:30 right there everybody
