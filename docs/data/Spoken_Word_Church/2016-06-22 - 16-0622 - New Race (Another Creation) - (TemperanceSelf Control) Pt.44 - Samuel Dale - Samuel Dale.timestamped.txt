[1:54] unveiling unto us but I I want to see
[1:57] him face to face and we got a promise
[2:00] that we'll have that opportunity so
[2:02] that's wonderful isn't it good to see
[2:04] everybody in the house of the Lord good
[2:05] to have sister Scoggins back with us and
[2:08] seeing her spry and jumping around and
[2:10] everything's going good so uh I told her
[2:13] she's welcome to go back and sit in my
[2:15] office if she needed to tonight so if
[2:17] she moves about you just you know going
[2:20] back there and sit and and watch it on
[2:23] the screen there oh remember now the uh
[2:27] Bible study will be the first Saturday
[2:30] in July and remember the fellowship
[2:33] meeting will be the 3rd I think that's
[2:34] the 16th or something and as far as
[2:37] we're knowing now is that brother
[2:39] pageant so we you know if there's any
[2:41] difference we'll let you know but it
[2:43] should be that amen but uh if you'd like
[2:47] turn in your scriptures turn where we've
[2:48] been reading in Revelations 3 and in
[2:52] second Peter
[2:54] 1 and just remember these now before
[2:57] you're seated I have some quotes quotes
[3:00] up here that you know a lot of people
[3:02] now we they didn't make it plain blunt
[3:06] brother brandham never taught it we
[3:07] don't believe it the Bible doesn't teach
[3:10] of the Bride going through the
[3:11] tribulation that's right no way because
[3:14] she is perfect through the blood of
[3:17] Jesus Christ but now there may be hard
[3:19] days ahead of us and I'm not a I don't
[3:23] know what you call it sister Susan
[3:25] talking her the other night about
[3:27] optimistic pessimist I never have
[3:28] figured out which one I was because I I
[3:31] never worried about it but you know I
[3:34] know what to profit I've tried to keep
[3:35] up with it for years and and things of
[3:38] what he would say about persecution
[3:41] coming to the church now not tribulation
[3:45] everybody understand not tribulation the
[3:47] bride does not go through the
[3:49] tribulation but there's two in here that
[3:52] he actually says it's thus sayith the
[3:54] Lord that there will be a persecution
[3:56] come so you know you take these I made a
[3:59] I hope enough to be able to make each
[4:01] family one and if not we'll run off some
[4:04] more and things and you know have having
[4:07] that and you read them study it I I'm
[4:10] not one to say I'm looking forward to
[4:12] this but I know what the prophet says
[4:14] this way and I don't think it's in there
[4:16] but he said the bride always done better
[4:18] under
[4:20] persecution we need to be tried a little
[4:23] bit we need to you know need to be
[4:24] clicked a little and things U but you
[4:27] know people will say well I I don't
[4:28] believe that well that's all right
[4:30] that's your thoughts but the prophet of
[4:33] God said these things so we just say we
[4:36] give you what he said and it's on the
[4:38] internet to be placed out to where that
[4:40] people can read it you know and that way
[4:43] you'll be reading what he says so
[4:45] remember that all Revelations 3 2 Peter
[4:49] 1 Heavenly Father we thank you tonight
[4:52] for your love and your grace unto us we
[4:54] thank you for the fact that this part
[4:57] part of the time that we are living that
[4:59] we we still do have our freedom and we
[5:01] know that things are vastly going away
[5:04] from us and all things could happen in a
[5:06] very short time because your Prophet
[5:09] said that the most of most of the Old
[5:11] Testament scriptures was fulfilled in
[5:14] the last few hours of Calvary so we know
[5:16] it can come fast and we look forward to
[5:19] you coming and whatever that transpires
[5:22] and takes then let it be as it is so we
[5:26] will just praise you and honor you and
[5:29] and thank you for all things forgive our
[5:32] sins because we want to be covered and
[5:35] be ready in that day in Jesus name
[5:39] amen okay Revelations
[5:43] 3 and unto the angel of the Church of
[5:46] the lady of sin right these things
[5:48] sayith the amen the faithful and true
[5:50] witness who the beginning of the
[5:53] creation of God all right now we go to
[5:56] Simon Peter and see what he has to say
[5:59] about this new creation right Simon
[6:03] Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus
[6:05] Christ to them that have obtained like
[6:07] Precious faith not written to the world
[6:09] right them with the same Faith he's got
[6:12] with us through the righteousness of God
[6:14] and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and
[6:16] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[6:19] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[6:22] see your thoughts may run to the
[6:25] point when you're reading that obtained
[6:28] like Precious faith and you say we have
[6:30] the same Faith as Peter well that's true
[6:34] cuz everybody does not have the same
[6:36] measure righten that is according to you
[6:41] is your measure so but it is the same
[6:44] New Birth that Peter had right okay
[6:47] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[6:49] through the knowledge of God and of
[6:51] Jesus our lord according as his divine
[6:54] power hath given unto us all things that
[6:57] pertain unto life and godliness through
[7:00] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[7:01] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[7:04] unto us exceeding great and precious
[7:07] promises that by these you might be
[7:09] partakers of the divine nature having
[7:12] escaped the corruption that is in the
[7:13] world through lust and beside this
[7:15] giving all diligence add to your faith
[7:17] virtue and virtue knowledge and to
[7:20] knowledge Temperance and to Temperance
[7:21] patience and to patience godliness and
[7:24] to Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[7:27] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[7:29] things be in you and abound now not just
[7:32] say in you they need to be piled up
[7:35] heaped up and you know great
[7:38] amount they make you that you shall
[7:40] neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the
[7:43] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you
[7:46] may be seated if you want to pass these
[7:49] out
[7:50] Wai well okay we'll keep them up here we
[7:53] don't want you reading them while while
[7:54] I'm preaching okay so make sure you get
[7:57] one in all right good good point okay
[8:01] good point all
[8:05] right but now what have we been talking
[8:09] about the stature of a perfect man from
[8:12] second Peter all right and knowing that
[8:15] the prophet is explaining that to us as
[8:19] to the very thing that God
[8:23] expects and God has provided now if he
[8:26] expects something of you and I
[8:30] then as one known fact he has provided a
[8:33] way all right so then that's that's
[8:36] within it and what is our way of
[8:39] climbing up the statue of a perfect man
[8:41] just like a baby's way of growing in
[8:44] height and size and thing is by eating
[8:47] so we just keep eating the word all
[8:49] right that you say but what brother Dale
[8:52] what I need virtue what could I read to
[8:54] get virtue read the Bible Well I I need
[8:57] to read certain scriptures don't not
[8:58] read the
[8:59] Bible that's right see just read and
[9:03] then God will take what you've read and
[9:05] turn that into what you
[9:07] need right he'll make it work out for
[9:11] the right place all right watch it in a
[9:15] second now as we tie back to something
[9:17] but what have we found out through the
[9:20] messages prior through we spoke on faith
[9:24] and then we spoke on virtue and
[9:27] knowledge and temperance I mean Faith
[9:30] virtue and knowledge last uh Sunday and
[9:34] then now we'll speak on Temperance today
[9:36] but we found that what the prophet says
[9:40] on the Statue of a perfect man he says
[9:42] have faith and be born again he say now
[9:45] that what you're doing is you're laying
[9:46] the foundation he said the foundation of
[9:49] all
[9:50] Christianity is based upon Faith all
[9:54] right then he goes on to paragraph 178
[9:56] say after you're born again these these
[9:59] are the things that he expects you to
[10:02] add all right now how have we found out
[10:05] that he expects you to add not you add
[10:09] in the bases of you making some way that
[10:12] you could come to do something but just
[10:15] partaking of his divine nature and
[10:17] letting it come from what did he
[10:20] say he says on paragraph uh
[10:24] one no par 44 the way back 62 he said
[10:28] the virtues
[10:29] of this Holy Ghost have to come from the
[10:32] inside out that's right amen all right
[10:36] so all we got to do is just keep taking
[10:38] the word in he will press out what we
[10:40] have need of and he will bring it as we
[10:43] have need of it right because it'll be
[10:46] there he doesn't expect everybody to uh
[10:49] climb the same way you know what I mean
[10:52] all together at one time this is not
[10:55] that way this is not a group therapy
[10:57] this is an individual of fire with Jesus
[11:00] Christ one grows faster than the other
[11:04] you know all right because that they are
[11:07] made that way all right then he says on
[11:10] the position of a believer in Christ we
[11:12] gave these last Sunday he said after
[11:14] coming into his body you become
[11:18] partakers of his divine nature after
[11:22] coming into the body so you're born
[11:24] again at
[11:26] Faith then he expects us to add virtue
[11:29] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[11:31] brotherly kindness and what do we
[11:33] emphasize over and over the new birth
[11:36] faith is not a virtue that's a birth
[11:39] that's right amen the baby comes here
[11:42] without
[11:44] virtues it must be taught those are grow
[11:47] into those in its life all right so is
[11:50] it with a baby in Christ that we become
[11:53] in the earnest of our inheritance all
[11:56] right we went from that of be born again
[11:58] and have let you know have faith and be
[12:01] born again then we talked about last
[12:03] Sunday that talking about virtue that it
[12:07] does not mean paragraph 143 it does not
[12:10] mean a virgin life in that situation it
[12:14] it was meaning strength amen you know
[12:17] and Jesus it said virtue went out of
[12:21] him why because they could draw
[12:25] something from him that was
[12:27] strength right all right then we went on
[12:30] into knowledge where it's talking about
[12:32] adding knowledge and it's knowledge to
[12:35] know that God that in his Bible that the
[12:39] Bible does not contradict
[12:41] itself all right that's the knowledge we
[12:43] need cuz remember now watch it in just a
[12:46] second These Are Holy Ghost virtues
[12:49] that's right they are not just virtues
[12:52] of an individual am all right we'll get
[12:55] to it and read it where you can have a
[12:57] portion of these virtues and not even be
[12:59] born again you've been around people you
[13:01] see them have you know great things in
[13:04] their lives that you like to be around
[13:06] them but that's not the Holy Ghost
[13:09] virtue because see that would not be
[13:11] just wanting to be around them and them
[13:13] being with that you couldn't come out to
[13:15] say virtue then would be
[13:17] strength see and and it would not lay
[13:20] into to that form but we talked about
[13:23] Sunday
[13:24] afternoon that the Bible does not
[13:27] contradict itself that's right and the
[13:29] prophet is speaking of the on uh
[13:32] paragraph I think it's 188 or something
[13:34] right in there he talks about the
[13:36] stature of a perfect man that these are
[13:38] he this is Heavenly
[13:41] knowledge right amen it's not Earthly
[13:45] remembering it's not just something that
[13:47] we read we ought to do that but it is
[13:50] Heavenly knowledge see that comes by our
[13:53] reading right amen you know our hearing
[13:57] our partaking the then it comes out to a
[14:00] Heavenly knowledge all right now and
[14:03] it's heaven born he called it
[14:06] knowledge now here's what I want you to
[14:09] think cuz I'll repeat this the next
[14:11] service the next one the next one the
[14:13] Lord willing all
[14:15] right see you must have faith as a new
[14:19] birth and be born again you cannot add
[14:24] virtue you know Holy Ghost virtue to an
[14:28] individual that's not born again
[14:31] amen all right are you with me now you
[14:33] cannot add virtue to a person that is
[14:37] not born again so that's that
[14:38] justification
[14:41] sanctification you don't expect those
[14:44] things to transpire all right but then
[14:47] when you're born
[14:49] again see now you can
[14:52] add
[14:54] virtue why because you have something to
[14:56] place it on Amen but now follow my point
[15:00] you cannot come to Virtue without being
[15:02] born again you say well I've got this
[15:04] knowledge that's head
[15:07] knowledge that's
[15:09] wonderful but that's not what it's
[15:11] talking about here this head knowledge
[15:14] that he comes to when he leaves virtue
[15:16] to come to head to knowledge that
[15:20] knowledge is Holy Ghost knowledg AM
[15:23] that's the only thing that will lay on
[15:24] the virtue amen that is Holy Ghost
[15:27] virtue right yeah right but see you
[15:30] can't run up to the ladder you can't say
[15:32] well I'll just bypass these and I'll go
[15:34] up here and I'll just start right here
[15:36] cuz this is this is the age we're living
[15:37] in all I got to worry about this age
[15:39] we're living in just got to worry about
[15:40] brotherly kindness we just we need
[15:42] brotherly kindness well go up in
[15:46] Philadelphia stay up there but You' find
[15:48] out I been up there a little bit it a't
[15:50] his brotherly
[15:52] kindnesses certainly Holy Ghost virtue
[15:54] kind virtue all
[15:57] right but see you first have to have
[16:00] faith and then the same
[16:04] material you remember that Sunday the
[16:06] same material of Faith you know
[16:10] Revelation Faith birth is what brings
[16:14] virtue into being amen it's the same
[16:17] material all right see it's not that
[16:20] virtue is one material knowledge is
[16:22] another material you know Temperance is
[16:25] another ETA no it's the same material
[16:28] we're going to strike it tonight because
[16:30] it's got to be the same material to
[16:32] vulcanize
[16:33] together all right see it has to be that
[16:36] and other words for us to follow it see
[16:39] then you don't just say well I've got a
[16:41] new birth now I'm going to add
[16:43] knowledge you can't do
[16:47] that irregardless of what you think
[16:49] about your knowledge you've got to have
[16:52] the
[16:54] virtue which is the Virgin life or
[16:56] living the life of Christ because what
[16:58] would would it be if you went from the
[17:00] birth to
[17:05] knowledge now come on we got a long ways
[17:08] to go down the road and some quotes it's
[17:11] going to get a little
[17:14] shaky brother BR
[17:17] says
[17:19] gifts without these virtues if you read
[17:22] the book you're supposed to what did he
[17:25] say gifts were without the virtues
[17:29] he said a stumbling
[17:33] block right well I just have knowledge
[17:37] that's a gift to me it's a gift of
[17:39] knowledge not it's a gift to
[17:40] gab
[17:43] yeah gift to
[17:45] Gap okay but are you following me now
[17:48] see as we go along we'll keep adding to
[17:51] the
[17:52] point because I want that instilled into
[17:55] your
[17:56] mind that see you start start by the new
[18:00] birth and then God adds virtue to
[18:05] you and you come out living a clean good
[18:09] life see it doesn't throw away with the
[18:11] Virgin it doesn't throw the Virgin life
[18:14] away it's just not meaning it in that
[18:17] situation because it would not
[18:20] fit see if you just said well that's
[18:22] just a virgin
[18:23] life well you know you say well I'm a
[18:27] virgin I'm I'm a virgin you know so I
[18:29] I'm in that category that's not
[18:32] exactly The Virtue that is speaking of
[18:35] in the Statue of perfect man although
[18:38] that's well and good and wonderful and
[18:40] honorable and
[18:42] desired you know should be desired to be
[18:46] but it's not what that is speaking of
[18:48] see you would limit yourself to what you
[18:50] would be thinking but if you take virtue
[18:53] as it is in the Statue of a perfect man
[18:55] then you can run it over a great
[18:57] category of a Christian life
[19:00] amen you know and you carry it to others
[19:03] and they can see all right now so is it
[19:06] with knowledge that you have
[19:10] knowledge and by having knowledge see
[19:14] then that being Holy Ghost
[19:17] knowledge and how did the prophet say
[19:20] you have it how do you check your
[19:24] knowledge you know how do you check your
[19:26] knowledge by virtue and by your faith
[19:31] right is that what we were reading
[19:33] Sunday see it's different read the book
[19:36] real
[19:38] slow and now most of us has got the
[19:41] older style books say I don't even know
[19:43] where they ever did put that one out
[19:45] with the with the uh statue of perfect
[19:48] man with the uh uh paragraph and things
[19:50] you know listed and most of your old one
[19:53] there is some word changing from your
[19:55] old one to your computer so so it's hard
[19:58] to follow you won't follow it by by
[20:01] saying paragraph so and so in the old
[20:03] the book that come out because you know
[20:05] that was just a way of doing it okay I
[20:07] say those things to keep you from
[20:09] getting look I can't find what I'm
[20:11] looking for sometimes you have to read a
[20:14] little bit backwards and forth to find
[20:17] what you're trying to find all right now
[20:19] to try to get you into that point all
[20:21] right but see heaven born knowledge then
[20:25] would be coming from heaven and I
[20:28] thought the prophet said what about
[20:30] heaven he said Heaven
[20:34] consists of the
[20:36] word amen right not just made by
[20:40] it not just created by it amen Heaven
[20:44] itself exists by the word because that's
[20:48] where God is so it's Heavenly
[20:52] knowledge that will will come together
[20:55] we'll see in a minute it will
[20:57] vulcanize
[20:59] if you got it right see your faith your
[21:01] virtue will vulcanize to the
[21:05] faith then your knowledge will vulcanize
[21:07] to it and then it won't be in sear you
[21:09] know it won't be you won't be able to to
[21:11] tear it down all right no so it would
[21:15] bring it so keep the point so we'll
[21:18] repeat that before you can add
[21:21] virtue you must have faith because
[21:25] that's the only thing you can add it to
[21:27] because is the same
[21:29] material the revealing of God's word all
[21:33] right before you can have knowledge you
[21:36] must have faith and virtue amen
[21:41] right then your knowledge will not be
[21:44] head
[21:47] knowledge it can come into an existence
[21:50] of Holy Ghost knowledge amen right y all
[21:54] right now keep that in mind so we'll be
[21:55] repeating that a good bit to where that
[21:58] it'll stay with you
[22:01] now let's start in what the prophet had
[22:03] to say now tonight
[22:07] about this little part we thought talk
[22:10] about of
[22:12] temperance you well Temperance that's
[22:16] that's you look it up you know and it's
[22:19] oh you know it won't say doing the way
[22:21] without alcohol but that's what most
[22:23] people think you know well you just
[22:26] don't drink no alcohol
[22:28] that's Temperance that person really got
[22:31] Temperance he a got a temper if F bu
[22:35] sa but got Temperance because he don't
[22:37] drank alcohol that's not exactly the
[22:41] Bible
[22:43] terminology the of what it's being said
[22:46] so all right so let's start on number
[22:47] one and we'll just read through a little
[22:49] bit and then make some comments because
[22:53] you say well why would you be trying to
[22:55] teach us these things when we're already
[22:57] up here
[22:59] here
[23:02] well
[23:04] uh Peter wasn't talking to people that
[23:07] was up there that's right right he was
[23:10] talking to people that was down there
[23:12] where faith is at right and he was
[23:15] trying to tell them how to get up there
[23:17] well see here comes brother brandham and
[23:19] that's what he said that these things
[23:21] came to him on the Statue of a perfect
[23:23] man down in the woods on a message he
[23:25] was trying to preach well he'd always
[23:27] tried to preach Christian Life I mean
[23:30] you go back to the interve and he talks
[23:32] about the bride being a walking
[23:35] instrumentality of God he always taught
[23:39] that but this brings in to see how to do
[23:43] it
[23:45] right he said connected in so then see
[23:49] how do we do it we do it according to
[23:51] what Peter says so what is it for
[23:56] tonight
[23:58] add
[24:01] Temperance right now as we'll go along
[24:04] and read where it talks about a temper
[24:08] now we're going to put this up front and
[24:09] then say it about three times going
[24:11] through see uh most people are taught
[24:14] when they get born again I don't have no
[24:17] temper right I I when that Holy Ghost
[24:20] came it took away all of my temper it
[24:23] took away all of my problems well now
[24:26] number one is one thing
[24:29] then you make Peter a
[24:32] liar because Peter said to as
[24:35] Temperance so you're making him
[24:38] lying you know come on you're making him
[24:43] wrong because he's telling us we must
[24:46] have this
[24:48] amen but but I I I when I got born again
[24:51] I ain't never had a 10%
[24:54] sin just let somebody cross you just a
[24:57] little bit
[24:58] come on boy kick a shovel out in the
[25:00] yard right see some people you can talk
[25:03] to and some better not cuz some get your
[25:06] feelings hurt because you expose them
[25:08] but you know I've always been able to
[25:10] say what I wanted to about brother I and
[25:12] he just Grunt and say preach it you know
[25:14] and uh
[25:17] but see we
[25:20] think and and I I'm agreeing with you
[25:25] listen that when you get born again
[25:29] you don't keep on living like the devil
[25:31] if you do there ain't even no need of
[25:32] talking about being born again I mean
[25:34] forget the whole situation that's right
[25:36] you know just drop it and forget it but
[25:39] something did happen amen but yet we
[25:43] still got a lot of the human parts of
[25:48] us that are not brought under control
[25:51] and I'm not talking about this
[25:53] body and neither am I talking about just
[25:57] to
[25:58] uh talk about the spirit realm of you
[26:01] know memories and conscious affection
[26:04] but now remember we'll get to that a
[26:05] little bit later that uh some of these
[26:07] virtues is listed in the the fruits of
[26:10] the spirit that's right there are
[26:12] expected to be there but just think
[26:15] about
[26:16] it so we'll read it where if it doesn't
[26:19] mean to stop drinking
[26:21] alcohol and it means controlling your
[26:26] tongue see then it's getting to a
[26:28] different situation than it would to
[26:30] just say I don't drink
[26:35] alcohol it's getting to working upon
[26:38] something that's within us because these
[26:41] virtues have to come from the inside out
[26:44] right A lot of people have them from the
[26:47] outside trying to bring it in and they
[26:50] can do this they can do that you know
[26:52] and they're nice people and
[26:54] wonderful you know and and in no way I
[26:58] throw it off on
[27:00] them but I'm just asking the question is
[27:03] it holy ghost
[27:04] Temperance or is it
[27:07] mine you know is it my
[27:10] ability I never was a person that
[27:14] um would be so-called having a
[27:18] temper I had plenty of it but you never
[27:20] knew
[27:24] it because I had a control of it
[27:28] you know and I I just wasn't uh you know
[27:33] to the basis and I always wondered if I
[27:37] had God's Temperance or my own because I
[27:40] did have we'll get back to it in the
[27:42] message kind of like a
[27:45] self-control where other people you know
[27:47] I've always told you I didn't use vulgar
[27:51] words you know I just didn't do it and
[27:54] and I certainly didn't use them the
[27:55] words anybody else cuz I I like my teeth
[27:58] staying where they were and that was a
[28:00] good way to lose some you know and get
[28:04] hurt because you just run your mouth all
[28:07] right but I I was always that way I've
[28:09] never had I didn't have to become a
[28:12] Christian to make those things I never
[28:15] liked uh violent
[28:18] Sports uh I played enough basketball and
[28:20] everybody think basketball is a good
[28:22] tender little sport but it's not if you
[28:24] play it right I've had teeth knocked out
[28:26] I've had everything from you know
[28:29] basketball but uh you know but I had a
[28:33] little control like say that about
[28:34] basketball you know how some people are
[28:36] rough and pushy and things about it this
[28:38] is a point and we were playing against
[28:40] some boys we played some pretty good
[28:42] teams around here and uh this boy kept
[28:46] pushing and I
[28:47] just I put up with it for a little while
[28:49] and then after a while I got right in
[28:50] his ear and I said
[28:53] listen if you push
[28:55] anymore me and you got problem problems
[28:58] we play in
[29:00] basketball we play
[29:03] rough but you're getting too
[29:06] much well you know what I never had no
[29:08] trouble with him the rest of the game I
[29:10] didn't stop him from playing ball I'm
[29:13] just saying I had a control back there
[29:15] when we get down to fact was saying you
[29:17] know you can have a certain amount of
[29:18] the you'll see that that's true but I
[29:20] always wondered if that was gone from
[29:24] me you know and and I had a man one time
[29:28] and I've always thought it like I've
[29:30] told you about it
[29:32] but I've always seen how that you know
[29:35] in the old days they would take a glove
[29:36] they'd have an argument they take a
[29:38] glove they slack each other's cheek they
[29:40] turn around walk out there take a gun
[29:41] walk off shoot each other and just kill
[29:44] him well I understood that because that
[29:46] was an
[29:48] insult you know the Striking was the
[29:50] insult well I always wondered if I could
[29:52] take that and I had a man at work one
[29:54] day he slapped my Jaws real good because
[29:57] because of something I done to him and
[29:59] uh I done back to him because what he
[30:02] was doing to me he was pinching me
[30:03] between the legs and I don't like people
[30:05] plays games like that and I kept telling
[30:07] him to quit so I pushed him pretty hard
[30:10] well he SLA
[30:12] me and instead of flaring up I stood and
[30:15] looked at the man and I was grinning
[30:18] this lat I had to you know after I
[30:20] received the baptism with the Holy
[30:23] Ghost and I was
[30:25] grinning and he just turned walked off
[30:27] and you know what he never bothered me
[30:29] no more never no
[30:30] problem but I was standing there saying
[30:33] Thank You
[30:34] Lord you got a temper you've had one
[30:38] you'll find out somebody will push you
[30:40] one
[30:43] day and you will see whether it's real
[30:46] or
[30:49] not you'll see where it was real by
[30:52] somebody putting you to a test okay
[30:54] we'll get to those in a minute but
[30:56] listen so what did he say let's go ahead
[30:58] and start
[30:59] reading and he starts off on paragraph
[31:02] 219 and that's what I tell you don't go
[31:05] to the book and try to find paragraph 19
[31:07] 219 you don't have paragraphs in the old
[31:09] book all right fourthly we have to hurry
[31:12] because it just feel so good to stand
[31:14] here and talk about it fourthly add
[31:17] Temperance oh my we've come to
[31:20] Temperance now you've had Faith first
[31:24] have to have that to begin with then you
[31:27] add virtue to your faith if it's the
[31:30] right kind of virtue then you add
[31:33] knowledge if it's a right kind of
[31:36] knowledge now you're going to add
[31:39] Temperance now watch it Temperance
[31:42] doesn't mean stop drinking
[31:45] alcohol here see because the word
[31:48] Temperance can be used to that here
[31:50] either no Temperance doesn't mean
[31:52] alcoholic cure not in this
[31:56] case are you with me now he's saying it
[31:59] see you would think I was saying part
[32:01] what now he's saying it that in this
[32:05] case now Temperance can be used as a
[32:07] stop drinking alcohol but not in this
[32:10] Bible case of what you're
[32:13] studying see what you're studying then
[32:16] is different this is Bible Temperance
[32:20] Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one
[32:22] of the lust what the drinking one of the
[32:25] lust of the flesh but we're talking
[32:27] talking about Holy Ghost Temperance that
[32:30] means how to control your
[32:33] tongue now what is it in the
[32:37] Bible man has always been has been had
[32:40] the ability to control every
[32:44] animal but what's the thing he can't
[32:49] control the
[32:53] tongue right now that's scripture you
[32:55] want me to bring that scripture it's you
[32:58] can't control the tongue well yes I
[33:01] can
[33:03] no no it's just admit
[33:07] it now here's what I'm standing and
[33:10] saying listen
[33:11] folks if we're talking about that we
[33:14] need virtue then that means we don't
[33:15] have
[33:17] it right or the Bible would say you've
[33:20] already got
[33:22] it if if we need knowledge that means we
[33:25] don't have it
[33:28] right now to say that we need Temperance
[33:30] that means we don't have
[33:33] it when I got born again I ain't had no
[33:35] temper since then we'll get to that in a
[33:37] little bit you know where you fussing
[33:38] and
[33:40] Ste and you know
[33:42] what if I've got a problem with the
[33:45] temperance a temper and I won't admit
[33:50] it where am I
[33:54] at I got a problem right that's problem
[33:58] so the first thing is to admit
[34:01] it so brother Dale if you got a temper
[34:04] this don't push me too far you might
[34:07] find it
[34:09] out but then I can grin because I don't
[34:11] believe it'll work I don't believe you
[34:13] can push me that far I've had
[34:14] professional try I've had some to really
[34:17] get in my face about it but I just say
[34:20] Lord you just take care of that now and
[34:22] it's it's never fled up for to make me
[34:24] hate anybody all right come now watch
[34:28] but we're talking about Holy Spirit
[34:31] Temperance that means how to control
[34:33] your tongue not to be a tadler how do
[34:36] you control your temper not fly off
[34:39] every time anybody speaks cross to
[34:44] you now get on down in where we
[34:48] live and we can talk about people out
[34:51] there we can talk road rage we can talk
[34:53] those things you know uh problems but
[34:58] get on down where we
[35:00] live get on in the
[35:05] message and
[35:09] see I thought brother brandham
[35:12] said that we're supposed to be able to
[35:16] what bitterly
[35:20] differ no now you know what bitterly
[35:22] different means bitterly different don't
[35:24] say brother kie I want to different you
[35:26] you with me we just going down no it
[35:28] don't mean that it says Bill Carly
[35:30] you're wrong and I'm right he says
[35:31] you're wrong and I'm
[35:33] right that's right right come
[35:36] on to bitterly
[35:40] differ but to love each other that'll go
[35:43] into brotherly kind this morning okay
[35:46] look and watch what he says boy a lot of
[35:49] us now he didn't say I would love
[35:51] brother Brown for that you know brother
[35:53] Brown didn't say y'all y'all y'all
[35:57] he always said us are
[36:00] we right he put himself right in there
[36:03] all the time he said boy a lot of us
[36:06] going to fall off before we get started
[36:09] if you think that ain't right it's
[36:10] either in the Statue of f man of
[36:12] Blasphemous night when the guy was
[36:14] challenging him and he
[36:17] said said I told him said leave him
[36:19] alone now I'm quoting him he said cuz I
[36:22] wanted it so bad he was
[36:25] human he didn't have a bad he wasn't mad
[36:27] at him or what but he
[36:30] wanted to let it be known okay that's
[36:33] him listen boy a lot of us are going to
[36:35] fall off before we get started aren't we
[36:37] then we wonder why the why God is not in
[36:40] his
[36:45] church now may I quote him
[36:49] again one unconfessed sin in a
[36:54] church I'm quoting him almost verb him
[36:57] I'll be glad to find he said will cause
[36:59] the church one he said will cause the
[37:02] church to bitterly
[37:04] fail and he says you will answer for
[37:08] that at
[37:10] judgment now if you need that
[37:12] quote be glad to get it for you he said
[37:16] just one unconfessed
[37:19] sin then we wonder why God is not in his
[37:23] church this doing Miracles and things
[37:26] that he they used to do yes sir and you
[37:29] know may I put it here why have we been
[37:32] here 50 years since the prophet has
[37:37] gone when the prophet himself said the
[37:40] don't thing he saw outside of the you
[37:43] know holding off coming to the Lord was
[37:44] read to the bride so it's evidently our
[37:48] problem
[37:50] right but yet we blame god well God I
[37:52] don't understand how come you ain't
[37:54] doing like you used
[37:55] to
[37:58] yeah okay watch add these things add
[38:02] Temperance to it oh Temperance how to
[38:06] answer in
[38:07] kindness when wrath is spoken to
[38:12] you somebody say you bunch of Holy
[38:14] Rollers down
[38:16] there don't jump up and roll up your
[38:19] sleeves see not that but talk with Godly
[38:24] love Temperance kindness
[38:27] is that the way you want to is that the
[38:29] way you want to be amen when you R upon
[38:33] R not back let him be your
[38:36] example okay when they said if thou be
[38:39] the Son of God turn these stones into
[38:41] bread he could have done it and show he
[38:43] was God but he had
[38:46] Temperance Temperance what does it mean
[38:49] Temperance and all of the definitions of
[38:52] temperance that I can find means
[38:54] self-control that's the base is and
[38:57] that's the number I'll give you in a
[38:58] minute it just means self-control all
[39:00] right now when they called him Bells you
[39:04] above he said I'll forgive you for it
[39:06] that right they pulled handfuls of beard
[39:08] out of his face and spit in his face and
[39:10] said come down off the cross he said
[39:13] father forgive them they don't even know
[39:14] what they're
[39:15] doing
[39:17] right then they come on down the
[39:19] prophecies and rag around his head and
[39:21] hitting him and everything you know so
[39:23] tell us who hit you we'll believe you
[39:26] see Temperance now if you got it like
[39:28] that add it to your faith if you still
[39:32] blow up and CE and fuss and stew and
[39:35] carry on huh you ain't got it you ain't
[39:39] got no you can't add
[39:43] that because it won't add see it won't
[39:51] vulcanize now we're in a day and
[39:53] understanding some of us older ones
[39:55] young kids don't understand it but we
[39:57] were in the day when we used to
[39:58] vulcanize patches onto
[40:01] tires right we had a little device and
[40:03] it stri a match to it and it burn it
[40:05] done because just a little old little
[40:07] old bicycle rub on tube patch it would
[40:11] hold but when it got
[40:13] hot but then they come up with what they
[40:15] call the it was a thing you put that
[40:17] little patch on it you vulcanize that
[40:20] and if it if it went just right it was
[40:22] just or stronger than the other original
[40:25] material
[40:26] but it had to be the same
[40:29] material
[40:31] right you can't put a piece of iron and
[40:33] a piece of rubber together oh they got
[40:35] some wonderful things today they they
[40:37] can do some amazing things with but it
[40:40] still it ain't going to work too good
[40:42] look you couldn't take it take a piece
[40:45] of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a
[40:47] piece of iron it just won't work no it's
[40:50] got to be flexible just like the rubber
[40:52] is and when your faith and your
[40:54] Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy
[40:57] Ghost Temperance that he had now the
[41:00] same kind he
[41:02] had see that's why it's not as much
[41:06] added it's the same kind he had then it
[41:10] will vulcanize with him you you're added
[41:13] to it when your virture is like his
[41:15] virture then it'll add to it when your
[41:18] knowledge is like his knowledge I come
[41:21] to do thy will oh god with the father's
[41:23] word he defeated every devil heavens and
[41:25] earth will away but the word will not
[41:28] see when you got that kind of knowledge
[41:30] it'll vulcanize with your faith when you
[41:32] got the right kind of temperance like he
[41:35] had it'll vocalize now there's three
[41:37] times he talks and says his like he had
[41:42] it that's not me and you then
[41:47] right bless God I just couldn't stand it
[41:49] I had to tell them all you ever heard
[41:51] somebody say it like this they say I
[41:53] just I know not have done it but I just
[41:55] told them all and you know what I got it
[41:57] off my mind and I feel
[41:59] better you ever heard that you ever said
[42:03] that
[42:06] oh well I just had to get it off my mind
[42:09] now if I thought it the prophet said I
[42:11] might as well speak it you want some
[42:13] more quotes
[42:15] yeah
[42:18] right I quote on
[42:22] okay look when you got the right kind of
[42:25] temperance like he haded a baniz if you
[42:27] have it just a man-made halfway Saed up
[42:33] belief or Temperance now I say I'm just
[42:37] honest I'm say that's what we
[42:42] have I said we
[42:46] have what is it it's a halfway manmade
[42:50] Saed
[42:52] up belief or temperance cuz then what do
[42:57] you say oh ought to slap him
[42:59] damn ever heard people say I ought to
[43:02] slap but I couldn't do
[43:04] it why would the thought be there why
[43:07] would the a ought to do it why would it
[43:10] come
[43:14] right why would that be any thought in a
[43:16] Christian's
[43:17] mind well I want to tell them
[43:21] off why would that be in a Christian's
[43:25] mind
[43:28] now now come on there's a lot of
[43:30] difference in telling the truth to
[43:32] somebody about something than the other
[43:35] ways right don't try to pull nothing
[43:39] just
[43:41] listen I ought to slap him down but
[43:45] maybe I better not cuz they might put my
[43:47] name in the paper about it that ain't
[43:50] the kind of temperance he's talking
[43:51] about don't try to add that it won't
[43:54] work but when you can really
[43:56] with the sweetness from your heart
[43:59] forgive every man can you do
[44:02] that hold your peace let it be
[44:07] gone see then it'll
[44:10] vulcanize you can add that to your faith
[44:14] when no wonder the church is so short
[44:17] isn't that right no
[44:19] wonder like somebody would say that old
[44:22] Antichrist you know you try to tell them
[44:23] the truth and they say that ain't
[44:24] nothing but the devil
[44:27] you know brother R said that God would
[44:28] am allow a person to say something to
[44:31] you to just see how you would react
[44:37] amen now look at him he's saying you're
[44:39] talking to somebody about baptism in
[44:42] name of Jesus Christ and that guy's a
[44:44] stricted you know somebody's a strict in
[44:45] don't believe that said that old
[44:47] Antichrist he's a Jesus name he's a
[44:49] Jesus
[44:50] only Look Out Boy I don't know about
[44:54] your Temperance right now
[44:56] why don't you come say let's reason this
[44:59] together brother brandom I'd like to
[45:01] hear this explained see then come down
[45:05] and listen to it and then it's put right
[45:08] before you and then you walk away see
[45:11] now if it's put before you walk away
[45:13] well we'll get to that just in a few
[45:15] minutes in godliness but when when you
[45:18] fly loose want to jump up at every
[45:22] conclusion now listen that's that's not
[45:26] it you haven't got Bible Temperance yet
[45:29] when you do that how to answer back then
[45:33] if you got all of this you can add this
[45:35] to your
[45:37] faith Holy Ghost
[45:42] Temperance how to control your
[45:53] tongue the word Temperance is 1644 for
[45:56] and your strong concordance it means
[46:00] self-control the
[46:02] virtue of one who
[46:04] Masters his desires and
[46:10] passions
[46:12] especially his sensual
[46:16] appetites now you're going all the way
[46:18] through bringing it all the way through
[46:20] everything because it even goes to your
[46:22] sensual appetites which means fleshly of
[46:25] lot of and it can mean too much
[46:30] eaten
[46:32] right
[46:34] okay do you know that
[46:37] Temperance is one of the fruits of the
[46:41] spirit go ahead with the
[46:44] next Galatians 5:22 which is number four
[46:49] but the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[46:52] peace longsuffering gentleness goodness
[46:55] faith
[46:56] meekness
[46:59] Temperance now what against such there
[47:02] is no law there you know why because
[47:05] they're of God so you if you'll read
[47:08] right back before then you'll find that
[47:10] you have works of the
[47:11] Flesh and you know that works of the
[47:14] flesh is Envy Strife seditions murder uh
[47:18] lustful things all kind of thing uh
[47:21] hatefulness you know tattletail tongues
[47:25] all the things but then bring it down to
[47:28] the meekness and
[47:30] Temperance the Bible knows a lot about
[47:33] all of our things don't
[47:35] it okay but
[47:39] look let's read this where you won't
[47:41] misund understand me go ahead with
[47:42] number five because the prophet covered
[47:46] here in statute of perfect man that
[47:48] there's two
[47:50] kinds of Faith two kind kinds of virtue
[47:54] two kinds of knowledge two kinds right
[47:58] and here that now and here's now get
[48:00] this lesson here is what's wrong with
[48:02] the with the I turn on for
[48:06] this here's what's wrong with the
[48:09] brandom
[48:10] Tabernacle you see there's two different
[48:12] kinds of Faith there's two different
[48:15] kinds of virtue as I had it the other
[48:17] day two different kinds of knowledge two
[48:20] different kinds of
[48:22] temperance one thinks it's probation
[48:25] will be
[48:26] you remember the old drinking problem
[48:29] they
[48:30] got that ain't the kind of temperance
[48:32] that God is talking
[48:34] about it's that uncontrollable ungodly
[48:38] listen uncontrollable temper that you
[48:42] got and things of that side fight back
[48:46] for
[48:47] us
[48:51] now as I've mentioned a couple of times
[48:54] you say
[48:56] but since I was born again I don't have
[48:58] no
[49:02] temper well Peter said we needed
[49:05] Temperance so he must have been
[49:07] referring to that we had
[49:09] temper if we needed Temperance right I
[49:12] mean is that true
[49:15] am all right now he calls it here
[49:18] ungodly uncontrollable temper you say
[49:21] well that's just that other number two
[49:24] temper it ain't number one one with me
[49:27] well you you got a
[49:30] point but what don't just be
[49:34] honest why don't we just be honest and
[49:37] talk about Christianity as an honest
[49:42] Point why is it this message has not had
[49:45] the effects upon the people of the world
[49:47] that's
[49:50] right why
[49:52] is it that this message has has not had
[49:56] the effects on your
[49:59] families you see I know now get to
[50:02] meddling
[50:04] then all right I'm the guy that can
[50:06] afford
[50:07] it the pastor can meddle everybody else
[50:10] can't okay amen all
[50:13] right why is it that your family doesn't
[50:16] want the message
[50:21] right uh for heaven help I hope you
[50:24] don't think that they're not
[50:28] predestinated because if you think that
[50:30] way you're predetermining them to
[50:35] hell so don't go that route
[50:42] amen you know that everybody's watching
[50:46] us right everybody at work watches
[50:51] you everybody you your sisters you can
[50:54] go to Walmart and everybody just like
[50:56] that brother down here you know was
[50:59] there and Wade and June was walking
[51:00] through Walmart and and he was going
[51:02] along you know walking and he looked I
[51:04] see and he back back come over and said
[51:08] where do y'all go to
[51:09] church well you know what he pulled up
[51:11] in Gillsville the other
[51:14] day and he didn't recognize me who was
[51:17] it got out somebody inhow he he he just
[51:21] wheed off the road and came straight
[51:22] down in he had a guy in the thing with
[51:25] him and when he did he seen me he said
[51:26] oh okay he said I was just going to stop
[51:29] and ask them sisters where'd they go to
[51:31] church all Peggy said I was going to
[51:33] stop see he didn't recognize her but
[51:35] when he recognized me he said I know
[51:37] where she goes church now
[51:41] well that's that's good you know you
[51:44] sisters you stand out I mean well man
[51:48] just a garbage in a
[51:51] home ain't nothing nice about us but you
[51:55] you Sisters You Stand Out you hire you
[51:58] dress no makeup and the things like that
[52:01] see you stand
[52:03] out well praise
[52:06] God I've been to Israel when you would
[52:09] think the women of Israel would be
[52:13] dressed right and doing right no
[52:16] way they're worst in America as far as
[52:20] most of
[52:23] it never saw a woman in Israel outside
[52:26] of the Believers that had on a
[52:35] dress but you understand what I'm
[52:39] saying could it be that we have put
[52:42] forth something for this message that is
[52:44] not the correct way for it to be put
[52:52] forth but Heaven help you to ever
[52:58] think about somebody that their family
[53:01] is in the
[53:02] message and you think that they
[53:05] something
[53:06] different you ought to think the
[53:11] good you see I know I'm
[53:14] hateful but our kids are
[53:21] here why is it your kids don't want to
[53:24] come
[53:27] well brother tell us the way you
[53:33] preach don't play cuz you can get in
[53:37] trouble playing okay just be honest and
[53:40] say listen I probably failed and I'll go
[53:42] do it I've told you some of you need to
[53:45] go to your families and apologize to
[53:48] them for the way you tried to pound this
[53:50] message into them and tried to change
[53:52] them and make them believe it in the
[53:54] thing you
[53:55] said I don't back
[54:02] up why not tell them I'm sorry I
[54:06] evidently didn't live before you the way
[54:08] I needed to
[54:11] live yes
[54:14] sir there's where Temperance comes in it
[54:17] makes red faces don't it okay all
[54:21] right but is that true see we can take
[54:25] like I said we can say what brother Dale
[54:28] brother Brandon was talking about the
[54:29] two different
[54:31] kinds and he saying that the the uh one
[54:36] that doesn't have Holy Ghost Temperance
[54:38] is the one with the ungodly
[54:40] uncontrollable
[54:42] temper well now he didn't say that right
[54:45] amen he just made a
[54:49] statement and see you justify
[54:54] yourself by saying
[54:58] it he's not talk about
[55:02] me yeah no
[55:06] okay go to number
[55:10] six maybe this will answer
[55:17] it paragraph 87 now I want to say this
[55:20] that there are some people who have a
[55:22] portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom
[55:24] patience and so forth that don't even
[55:27] profess to be a
[55:30] Christian now we just we're teaching
[55:32] Sunday school and that's true there some
[55:35] people have a portion of this that don't
[55:37] even pretend to be
[55:40] Christian but that doesn't now watch his
[55:43] answer that won't do
[55:46] it having a portion of these things
[55:49] without the Holy Ghost won't do
[55:51] it having the gifts without the virtues
[55:54] stumbled and block listen to what he
[55:55] says that won't do it it's like a
[55:58] blackbird trying to put peacock feathers
[56:00] in his
[56:05] wings now he's talking about not two
[56:09] different kind of Virtues but some have
[56:12] a portion of these things that claim to
[56:14] be
[56:17] Christians
[56:19] right he said that's like a peac with a
[56:22] you know the Buzzard the Blackbird
[56:24] trying to put peacock feathers in make
[56:26] him a peacock he only disgraces himself
[56:29] be better to stay a blackbird see when
[56:31] he tries to exercise these things
[56:33] without being a Christian he's just
[56:36] simply all out of
[56:41] place when I started preaching this
[56:45] part when I started with the
[56:48] justification the sanctification and the
[56:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost and bringing
[56:52] those things down to the level I brought
[56:54] it
[56:56] it I was expecting a lot of people to
[56:59] probably
[57:00] leave I told it you know I said we
[57:02] probably lost internet people come find
[57:04] out we increase well thank
[57:10] God but how many of you have faced
[57:14] yourself you
[57:15] know you don't you don't face me I'm not
[57:19] in the mirror looking back at
[57:21] you how many of you faced yourself and
[57:25] all this series and said well Lord could
[57:27] it
[57:29] be that I need a new
[57:37] birth now we're coming up to the Statue
[57:39] of a perfect man so it's very easily for
[57:42] us to say could it be Lord I need these
[57:44] virtues because that's
[57:47] definite see the Born Again experience
[57:50] between you and God the definite part
[57:52] we've got to have these virtues that's
[57:54] that's not a question
[57:55] that's definite amen these are required
[57:57] amen
[57:58] y well do we have them well where you at
[58:02] brother Dale I've only never told you
[58:04] but one thing in my
[58:06] life I question God about where I was
[58:09] and this was his statement and you know
[58:11] it verbatim right he said if you'll have
[58:15] patience with the people said it'll
[58:17] prove you got patience
[58:20] amen well and you know what I TR to work
[58:25] on with
[58:27] patience right cuz we that supposed to
[58:32] be okay but
[58:38] listen a continuation from the other on
[58:41] Blasphemous names goes right on through
[58:43] but it'll be number seven of what we're
[58:45] picking up here so let's go to it and
[58:47] end the message with this
[58:51] part cuz it's this is just this directly
[58:55] under where he was saying it on the
[58:58] Blasphemous
[58:59] names about that we had these
[59:02] two he said patience and so forth
[59:05] there's a mockery of it a pretending to
[59:08] be a nature given Faith
[59:11] listen a nature given virtue there's a
[59:14] nature given
[59:16] Temperance all these things are nature
[59:20] given now he's not talking about the New
[59:22] Birth there right that's just nature
[59:24] given right
[59:28] amen and that's good and
[59:31] wonderful look and the biggest part of
[59:34] our
[59:35] faith is mental
[59:42] Faith by hearing the word it brings us
[59:44] to a mental con recognition of
[59:47] God but if this coming from above oh
[59:51] brother if it ever strikes this there's
[59:54] a God Godly spiritual Faith then what
[59:58] does that Faith do that Faith only
[1:00:00] recognizes the word nobody WR anything
[1:00:02] else it only recognizes the word you
[1:00:04] know the word is still God and always
[1:00:06] will be and when the word itself is
[1:00:09] pouring into our
[1:00:16] faith now let's use that right there as
[1:00:19] a
[1:00:22] thought let's see how that you get these
[1:00:26] virtues in case you haven't followed it
[1:00:28] with the fact of eating and and uh these
[1:00:31] were the things that Adam is God will
[1:00:33] automatically add it because all we got
[1:00:36] to do is bring him the word then he
[1:00:37] pushes it back out in case you haven't
[1:00:40] done it just listen to this statement
[1:00:47] amen and when the word
[1:00:49] itself now we're talking about
[1:00:52] Christians now right
[1:00:55] Christians we're talking about the
[1:00:57] stature of perfect land we're not
[1:00:58] talking about this trying to get you
[1:00:59] born again and you got to have a
[1:01:01] spiritual Revelation that's wonderful
[1:01:03] but just bring that up in your thoughts
[1:01:06] tonight to where we're
[1:01:09] at and when the word itself is pouring
[1:01:12] into our
[1:01:13] faith our mental Faith becomes a
[1:01:17] spiritual
[1:01:19] Revelation amen have you ever had God to
[1:01:23] speak to you
[1:01:25] while somebody was
[1:01:27] preaching and show you something that is
[1:01:31] not even the thing maybe he's preaching
[1:01:33] absolutely amen sir amen you know he's
[1:01:37] preaching on Daniel 70 weeks or
[1:01:39] something and God drops into your heart
[1:01:42] and shows you one
[1:01:45] God right shows you
[1:01:50] predestination well you know what
[1:01:52] brother randam said a preacher was
[1:01:54] supposed to to
[1:01:55] do a preacher only breaks the spell that
[1:01:59] Satan has over your eyes now that's the
[1:02:02] verbatum almost to where God can come
[1:02:06] and speak to
[1:02:10] you you remember what I've always said
[1:02:13] then when God speaks to you while
[1:02:15] somebody's preaching just raise your
[1:02:17] hand and say my family my kids my
[1:02:20] husband my wife right while it's being
[1:02:23] revealed to you just speak to
[1:02:26] him and thank him for
[1:02:30] it you will see it'll work
[1:02:35] amen so now
[1:02:37] what and when the word itself is poured
[1:02:40] into our
[1:02:41] faith our mental Faith becomes a
[1:02:45] spiritual Revelation watch and Upon This
[1:02:47] Rock I'll build my church
[1:02:49] see not upon a mental conception of
[1:02:52] church joining a mental conception of
[1:02:54] that but upon the Revelation when them
[1:02:57] streams cuz remember blus names he's
[1:03:00] explaining the dream of sister Shepherd
[1:03:03] and how she was concerned whether she
[1:03:05] had the holy ghost or not and the water
[1:03:07] was running down and all and if you'll
[1:03:09] I'll find it for you in there he talks
[1:03:11] about her being charitable and that but
[1:03:13] in one statement he makes it he said God
[1:03:16] accepted her foundation well what's the
[1:03:18] foundation in other words God was
[1:03:20] telling the lady she was born again amen
[1:03:26] right not upon a mental concept of
[1:03:28] church joining a mental concept of that
[1:03:30] but upon the Revelation when them
[1:03:32] streams of Grace has poured into that
[1:03:34] mental faith that you've
[1:03:37] got then upon this a spiritual
[1:03:40] Revelation I'll build my church and the
[1:03:43] gates of hell can't Prevail against it
[1:03:45] see that shows they would be against it
[1:03:48] but it'll never Prevail oh what a
[1:03:50] glorious thing now see the faith these
[1:03:53] five streams
[1:03:55] so do you
[1:04:00] see it's
[1:04:02] no point of
[1:04:05] us trying to
[1:04:07] play and to try to
[1:04:10] manufacture
[1:04:12] something as the prophet said it's just
[1:04:15] just remain a blackbird is better than
[1:04:17] trying to put peacock feathers in cuz at
[1:04:20] least you know what's that you know what
[1:04:22] it
[1:04:23] is but see we should be the same thing
[1:04:26] all the
[1:04:27] time our familyes should not see us one
[1:04:30] time and then another time see us with a
[1:04:33] little hatred a little thoughts about
[1:04:35] somebody well you know that person they
[1:04:37] said I just already just told them
[1:04:40] off
[1:04:42] well that shouldn't be done in any of
[1:04:45] our
[1:04:46] Lives we should put it to the point of
[1:04:49] saying whatever it takes Lord make me
[1:04:51] what I need to be right right
[1:04:57] is that your desire just to what he
[1:04:58] wants me to
[1:05:00] be not what I want to be what he wants
[1:05:02] me to
[1:05:06] be then the people around you will just
[1:05:09] automatically see it
[1:05:13] amen right my
[1:05:19] family oh yeah they love me as the baby
[1:05:23] boy and all of the
[1:05:26] family but they care nothing about
[1:05:28] coming around to hear
[1:05:31] us and I pray that I've never made
[1:05:34] them you know do something because of my
[1:05:37] own actions and ways but now you let one
[1:05:40] of them get
[1:05:44] sick you let them get sick they'll come
[1:05:46] looking this
[1:05:48] up you know well maybe that's enough
[1:05:51] that part of
[1:05:53] it
[1:05:58] yeah but I just I just want to be what
[1:06:02] God wants me to
[1:06:05] be and being Pastor that puts you in a
[1:06:08] position see that that you know
[1:06:10] sometimes you got to speak hard
[1:06:13] sometimes you got to say things rough
[1:06:15] and
[1:06:16] all but I I like what the two you know
[1:06:19] that's told it one lady said brother R
[1:06:21] called her a buzzard and other lady
[1:06:23] heard the same message that he called
[1:06:25] her an
[1:06:27] eagle if my holling and screaming at you
[1:06:29] or correcting or saying something
[1:06:32] hard that you say well he's talking
[1:06:34] about me well you know I might not be
[1:06:37] talking about you I might be talking
[1:06:40] about the person sitting next to
[1:06:42] you but
[1:06:47] irregardless why shouldn't we take it
[1:06:51] correctly and say thank you
[1:06:55] thank you for correcting me for telling
[1:06:59] me you know what I need to
[1:07:03] be and just say thank you
[1:07:08] Lord oh yeah I've had people tell me
[1:07:11] things I didn't
[1:07:12] like but you know what I analyze to see
[1:07:15] whether that's right or
[1:07:17] not and if it is then I say thank you
[1:07:20] Lord and if it's not right then I just
[1:07:23] say well thank you Lord for them saying
[1:07:25] it anyway cuz I needed it like I said
[1:07:28] about the man slapping my jaws I needed
[1:07:29] that see cuz I always wondered if I
[1:07:31] could take
[1:07:33] that you
[1:07:38] know but if you ever if you've ever been
[1:07:40] in a situation I told another another
[1:07:42] brother one time I said somebody will
[1:07:45] try you one
[1:07:46] day to
[1:07:49] see they're going to try you everybody's
[1:07:51] going to be
[1:07:52] tried
[1:07:55] you
[1:07:56] know road
[1:07:58] rage all of
[1:08:01] that you
[1:08:02] know why can't you just wave and say
[1:08:06] thank you let everything's all right you
[1:08:12] know it's hard to
[1:08:15] do
[1:08:17] right cuz on you thinking about what
[1:08:19] could have killed me they could have
[1:08:20] done this were you not
[1:08:22] dead
[1:08:28] why not think about it as child
[1:08:32] training you know to help
[1:08:34] us
[1:08:41] amen but you see that's where people
[1:08:43] would take what they want to take about
[1:08:46] what you're
[1:08:52] saying and that puts it in a hard
[1:08:55] position because then you're the one to
[1:08:57] get blind for
[1:08:59] it well I have no problems with being
[1:09:01] blind for what's
[1:09:04] right no problems with it s I've always
[1:09:08] said if you got any problem come talk to
[1:09:10] me don't go talk to somebody else just
[1:09:12] come talk to me about it and tell
[1:09:16] me no
[1:09:18] problem we'll get to that on brotherly
[1:09:21] kindness and you'll see that with
[1:09:22] brotherly kindness I have been able
[1:09:25] to do a lot of things that other
[1:09:27] ministers don't
[1:09:30] do you know to put up with
[1:09:34] people there was a situation here in the
[1:09:36] church one time years
[1:09:39] ago and I was praying desperately Lord
[1:09:42] what what must I
[1:09:44] do and this is what he
[1:09:48] said he said I put it in your
[1:09:52] hands you can do what you want
[1:10:03] to that's what he told me it's anytime
[1:10:06] you want to you can do what you want to
[1:10:09] you know what till this day I ain't
[1:10:10] never
[1:10:12] done what I could have
[1:10:19] done I've never done
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:25] you said well that's okay that's me you
[1:10:27] see that's that's but he just told me he
[1:10:31] said it's up to
[1:10:35] you I sure ain't going to put myself in
[1:10:37] no category but what brother brandom do
[1:10:40] when that man and woman was hugging and
[1:10:42] kissing and everything out in the
[1:10:47] congregation the holy spirit said speak
[1:10:49] the word and they'll carry them out of
[1:10:52] here what did he say he said I forgive
[1:10:59] you you see I believe in a guard like
[1:11:02] that don't
[1:11:03] you come on musicians I didn't want to
[1:11:06] try to put in the next one with you know
[1:11:10] brotherly kindness and all to try to
[1:11:13] pack into it one time so we're kind of
[1:11:15] short tonight it ain't even 8:30 yet all
[1:11:18] right so we're giving maybe sister Genie
[1:11:20] doesn't have to sit too long okay
[1:11:24] she wouldn't have
[1:11:26] cared all right but you see
[1:11:30] church maybe that maybe that's some of
[1:11:33] the patience you know and we have you
[1:11:37] know because that's we need patience you
[1:11:42] I've always said there's one thing about
[1:11:44] it a preacher does one or two things he
[1:11:46] either helps you or hurts you and if you
[1:11:48] take the hurt right then you're okay
[1:11:50] because it'll help you you know all
[1:11:54] right see let Christ
[1:11:57] live and you'll see that that your your
[1:12:01] temper part will go
[1:12:05] away and you'll see that you can look at
[1:12:08] somebody and actually love
[1:12:11] them instead of hating them no matter
[1:12:14] what they
[1:12:16] say that you can actually love them and
[1:12:19] pray for
[1:12:22] them
[1:12:26] controlling that tongue cuz you've heard
[1:12:29] great messages about it hav you from the
[1:12:32] prophet and by every preacher that
[1:12:33] you've ever seen in your life has always
[1:12:34] preached on the tongue and how that's
[1:12:36] uncontrollable right ever Baptist
[1:12:39] preacher in the world preached on
[1:12:40] uncontrollable
[1:12:42] tongue and there was the one that had
[1:12:44] the longest tongue in the whole
[1:12:51] building all right let's St what we got
[1:12:54] brother
[1:12:59] 22 just think about it
[1:13:06] Temperance goes
[1:13:09] before
[1:13:10] me and with his loving
[1:13:15] hand he leads the way
[1:13:20] right and with each day
[1:13:25] I
[1:13:25] whisper
[1:13:27] iore just be like
[1:13:32] him you know they call them
[1:13:36] Christians remember that in the
[1:13:38] Bible they never listed at all the
[1:13:40] building the
[1:13:42] places Antioch I believe
[1:13:45] right the Bible said they call them
[1:13:51] Christians why didn't they call up other
[1:13:53] churches and other
[1:13:56] thing because they could see those
[1:14:00] people was Christ
[1:14:05] Living they could see Christ Living in
[1:14:07] their heart and they called him
[1:14:11] Christians would that be an
[1:14:16] honor a glory to be called
[1:14:22] Christians
[1:14:25] anybody have a
[1:14:28] need I
[1:14:30] see

[1:16:58] footprint
[1:17:01] breath
[1:17:03] whisper he didn't have a
[1:17:07] temper but he had a sternness about him
[1:17:10] to walk with him each that when they
[1:17:12] would even do what they do he'd run them
[1:17:14] out of the temple each step I
[1:17:18] take I know come on Church the Bible
[1:17:22] says be angry to Higher Ground and sin
[1:17:26] not he
[1:17:28] ever me on you know what that means a
[1:17:32] Christian until is subject to
[1:17:35] anger the last step will be Tak just
[1:17:39] don't let that the Bible said Don't Let
[1:17:41] the Sun Go Down on your
[1:17:43] wrath
[1:17:46] it brother random said Jesus got angry
[1:17:51] when he drove him out of the Temple
[1:17:56] but he didn't get mad a lot of
[1:17:58] difference in
[1:17:59] it same man climbed up on a cross and
[1:18:02] died for the
[1:18:05] people it wasn't
[1:18:07] anger it a difference between anger
[1:18:13] and being
[1:18:18] mad but mad is
[1:18:21] uncontrollable I hope it'll just don't
[1:18:24] own you what I'm trying to
[1:18:27] say we're human beings living in the
