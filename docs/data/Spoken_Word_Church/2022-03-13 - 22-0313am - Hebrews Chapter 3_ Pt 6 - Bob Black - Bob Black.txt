========================================

god bless you thanks and good morning trying to get used to all this fancy new equipment and everything this is this is awesome all right we're on uh hebrews chapter three looking at the i think we're almost done with the provocation part of it let's just let's just pray before we get into this lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together and we just ask your blessing as we look into the word and study these things out and i pray lord that you just bless brother wade for the service this morning and this afternoon lord as we come expecting granite lord in the name of the lord jesus amen so let's just read uh through a few of these um verses where we kind of left off last time hard not your heart says in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me prove me and saw my works forty years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest so that's what we're going to in hebrews chapter 4 is the rest to see what see what that what what that's about take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief i see where he's placing unbelief is in your heart so that's that's where it all stems from as if you your faith and doubt starts in your heart and departing from the living god but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin now exhort one another means to constantly be be uh we're trying to help one another because we're all we're all going to try trying to get to that place of rest where we have where we can have confidence in what we believe and be resting in in christ so we exhort one another daily poking and prodding at one another and and moving along so in verse 14 it says for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end while it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whoms where he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they cannot enter in because of unbelief now brother brahma said and why it had to be shepherd and we we read this last time he said now that uh all israel did not receive the prophet shepherd's word all of israel didn't receive it he said now notice they was complaining oh when he was performing the miracles he was a great fellow but when it come to his message that was different all great signs follows a new message coming we know that in the wilderness they complained in the wilderness and died by the thousands frankly there wasn't only two of them that ever went through that was saved out of a two and a half million two out of two and a half million you say what happened to them they're eternally gone all of them brother branham jesus said so they said our fathers he manna in the wilderness and they drank from the rock and he jesus said and they are everyone dead eternally separated see everyone and why why were they why are they so we will talk about death here just for for a few minutes why were they separated from the fellowship of god because of their unbelief they failed to believe and you see how sometimes unbelief can sneak up on us they they failed to believe they failed to recognize what their purpose was that their purpose was to go into the promised land if your purpose is to go into the promised land and then god's going to take care of everything else leading up to it when they get thirsty god's going to give you a rock to drink from when they get hungry guys are going to give you food when they when they got into a rough spot when they got to bitter waters god's going to take care of that if you just if you'll just trust and so so many times we'll lose sight of what our purpose is you're the church has been the bride has been commissioned to cast out devils we've been commissioned to to to overcome we've been commissioned to tear down strongholds to tear down idols and if we lose sight of what that is then then we begin to we begin to you can see how even in a morning in christian's life you can begin to start faltered the devil the devil we'll read a quote here in a minute where in the greatest battle ever fall the devil wants to to try to for to get you to doubt what you've got to doubt what you have access to and to disbelieve that that you've got a sword in your hand now so so you see where death comes from death comes from disbelieving god's word now in john chapter 6 jesus said verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life i am that bread of life now so he's he's tying himself back to that manner that they ate from in the wilderness your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead so they they they ate man in the wilderness and they in other words they went to church and they did all the things that you know you know so-called christian would do and everything but yet they failed to believe what god had given them and it and and see that how that ties back with with what eve did in the garden of eden of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it god told them for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shalt surely die now you can see that that the devil the devil is a liar and you know and so we're going to examine that a little bit this morning because brother ram you know he in the friend when he preached the first seal he talked about how that that that is that how the devil twisted that thou shalt not surely die he twisted that and it became the lie and we'll see how you know really it it could come become really easy to slip over into into taking something that the devil throws at you and saying well uh you know that's not so bad that's that doesn't sound so bad now listen to what brother brown said in oneness he said now when adam and eve and again the whole context of what we're talking about is the provocation in the wilderness the reason why they couldn't go under rest because because they they disbelieved they got caught up in their own ideas and looking back to egypt thinking that they were better off then than they were now discounting the the leadership that god had given them saying i directed let's let's just elect our own captain let's let's let's just uh we want somebody else to lead us than the leadership of the holy spirit brother raymond in message oneness he said now when adam and eve listened to the lie of the devil the holy image of god left them their fellowship was broken with god their fellowship of oneness with god was broken the very minute they listened to the lie of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute that you listen to the lie of the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of god like she did is when you fail to take god's word just as it is now in genesis make sure i got my slides here in genesis you know we just read that of the tree of good knowledge of good and evil don't don't eat it but you'll surely die and the serpent just twists he just added one word to it and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die now now you see what what happens when you when you add one word or take one word it what it what it does is it changes the meaning you know you can you when we when we think of one word off or we lose our fellowship you can almost get into like a nervous nervous situation where you're you you know one word off let's let's think about what that means one word off the hebrews could say the jews would say well you've got to understand the hebrew the original hebrew to get it exactly right or you've got to you've you gotta go back to the original greek and get it exactly right and and and you can kind of belabor that point but but really what we're talking about is the meaning when when when the devil added one word when satan added one word or when he takes one word it changes that underlying meaning but that's why brother i listed out all the all the places where he said a word what a word is he said a word is a thought expressed a word is a thought made manifest when god thinks anything in his mind and then when he expresses it it's eternal so so think about this the one word off where does it start from it starts from your thinking it starts from the revelation of what that thing is or the the understanding of what it is so when the devil added one word to it it changes changed the meaning god thought it then when he expressed that it has to happen for the world was framed by the word of god a word is a thought expressed you have to think it before you express it now a word is a thought expressed it's a thought first you think it then you speak it amen that's why in chapter in luke chapter 6 jesus taught us that a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh now you see the problem of the of the the children of israel in the wilderness was they started thinking they started thinking wrong they started thinking they needed a different leader they started thinking that the giants were too big they started thinking and then when they started thinking they started speaking we need another leader we need uh moses who do you think you are to lead us and and and all so i once you start thinking wrong you start speaking wrong now now let's examine this and i don't know if you can read that just if you can't see it i'll just i'll just i'll just listen in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 12 says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak so now that you know you can speak not in the words now now see what what the point remember the point i'm trying to make is i i if you to be one word off starts starts in your mind starts in your thinking which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned now there's that word discerned to know right from wrong now see go back to eve standing there the reason why she was she listened to the devil's lies because she lost sight of what her purpose was she wanted to jump the gun and and have more wisdom than than adam or even to to have to know the secret and and think about how almost strange that would be to go listen to a beast plowing in the field or whatever doing menial labor while they're walking in the cool of the evening with god every evening or you know god would come down and talk to them but she wanted to go out it felt like she had to go out and get some some secret revelation from from their from their gardener that wasn't even human and and she that's lacking discernment to be able to know truth from from false but he that is spiritual it says judgeth all things he that is spiritual judgeth all things what are you judging by you're judging by the word to know what is right and wrong yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that we may and that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ so that's how that's how you keep things straight is by having an understanding that you know you can get so much in like a nervous frustration or how how how do we if i'm if i misplace one little thing but if you have a if if it's revealed to you if it's revealed to you the right words will be spoken if it's if you have a revelation now let's let's let's dive in a little bit more in romans chapter 12 it says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so as you eat the word your thinking is actually changed so that when you look at circumstances you're not swayed by them like like a goliath rising up or or how they would say that the the land does devour it will devour us when they saw the promised land that you're not going to be swayed by that because your thinking has changed and instead of looking at the circumstance you're looking at god's word in hebrews 11 it says now now hebrews 11 we're going to jump over there and we'll get to there eventually but look how they all of these all of these saints considered they didn't just go in with like a blank slate mind but they thought about it in their mind they thought and they they reasoned out whether these things could be true through faith sarah received strength the conceived seed and she was delivered and was delivered of a child when she was past stage because she judged she judged him faithful who had promised and hebrews 11 19 accounting that god was able to raise him up abraham even for abraham talking about isaac even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure and hebrews 11 24 to 26 by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of abraham's daughter choosing rather to choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt in other words these people thought about it they reason if god was able to deliver me from all of these things that in my past brought me from point a to point b this far then he's able to carry me on to the end now now look look how you we're talking about one word off look go ye therefore jesus taught in matthew 28 go go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost now peter on the day of pentecost didn't just repeat those words but he he had a supernatural understanding in other words his thinking had been changed he thought he knew he knew how what it was and so because he knew he was able to speak it and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you know maybe maybe just consider you know how are we going to come to a speaking condition where we can speak the word is because we will come to a place where we know what god wants done with the word where we know not because we've just memorized a lot of scriptures in our mind but we have an understanding of those scriptures the meaning that's what i'm talking about the meaning here now you you think about how easy well let's here's another example in matthew chapter 16 and and i know you there's a little small to read but um so i'll just i'll just kind of tell the story at the beginning of of this of this story jesus asked the disciples who who do you say that i am and and simon peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god and and peter gave him the jesus told him all these things about flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee and but my father which is in heaven but but uh go a little bit longer down you keep reading and jesus began to tell him how he was going to suffer and die on the cross and and and and peter began to rebuke him now now see peter did not have an understanding he didn't have a revelation and so jesus turned and rebuked him and said get me get thee behind me satan now right after jesus had had that great or peter had that wonderful confession of of thou art the christ the son of the living god right after that jesus turns around and rebukes him and says get thee behind me satan you see how how deceptive a lie can be a lie because peter did not have the understanding he didn't have he didn't know the meaning of of jesus's life his purpose of his life was to die for us and so peter not being inspired by the wrong thing spoke something that was wrong because he didn't have an understanding his thinking was not right the thought that that what he was thinking about was not lined up with god's word so you can see how a lie can sound pretty good a lie can sound pretty good it sounds pretty good to say jesus why you why you got to die i love you why would you want to die why would you want to go on the cross in matthew 16 we just read and peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from me lord this shall not be under thee and that's what and you compare that with with eve or where she listened to the lie of the devil ye shall not surely die and and that all the things that the devil said to her sounded pretty good for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil it sounded pretty good but she had lost sight of what her purpose was that god was going to use her to bring life if she'd just wait wait on things now see what brother brown said in the greatest battle ever fought he said see his attack listen close this close and his attack is what to disbelieve god's word that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces satan and god and what is satan's weapon against you is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you let's listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you now now see he's talking about he's talking about christians christians going along going along through the wilderness going going through a place of go trying to get to that place of real i will say trying to get to adoption trying to get to a place where you're in the maturity of god's word if he can get you to doubt what you've got how are you going to get to rest now you see that devil's lie you shall not surely die see how that that comes in stages now you take somebody that's a young person that's in the church or or maybe someone that's new to the message and the devil will tell you a lie that you don't need to be born again that that uh he'll he'll tell you that it's not for you that god doesn't care about you and and pile on all these lies and then and then you maybe you'll start to thinking thinking that that's right that you that the world is better and and and and you'll believe the level devil's lie if you're not careful and and not be saved now see the devil's lie you're not going to die if you go away from god's word if you if you don't believe god's word you're not going to die but you will die the only the only you see what a gentleman god is that he won't force it on anybody he lays the word in front of you and you have a choice whether to exceed receive it or accept it to to you you're right right now you're judging whether these things be true as we sit in church all day long you know you're judging whether it's whether it's correct and then then after you're born again after you're born again then then the devil changes his tactics he said he'll say you you're not going to die now look look how brother ramone preached that message uh why pentecost failed all these pentecostals they got the baptism of the holy ghost and they they they began to speak in tongues and these kind of things and then then they began to think he said you failed because you didn't go on and you think well i i'm good i'm set but yet you got to go on because you need to come to adoption you there's more to it and to think well i'm i'm good i'm i'm good and and then they you'll just you'll keep going on and go down into the ground because because there's there's more to it you see how if we go back to that chart that we looked at from the very beginning can you let's just let's just ask some questions can you see god's purpose in your life or do you do you stumble at parts of the word like eve did because we're coming to a place where we're trying to come to a place of rest where we know the things of god are true do you stumble at things like like eve did where i'm gonna have to go out and listen to some some kind of false thing so i can get truth are you willing to let god be the lord of your heart are you willing to take correction are you willing to let the word have have preeminence in your life and correct things that are wrong brother brown said in the message conferences he said will not be like eve one have this and one have that a disfigured body it'll be word by word what god said it'll be word by word there's going to be a bride that will be that will be built up and know what god wants done with the word that will have a complete understanding of what our purpose is now brother ram in the message one this he said let me make that again do not believe this believe any word of god's bible but just don't say yes i believe it say but no there's nothing about that you believe it you'll accept it if you lay it aside say well my church don't believe it that way then you do not believe it's god's word and you'll walk away under the same condemnation that eve went away under you separated yourself from the eternal when you had a chance to be united with him now remember that cannot be questioned because it was one word that in god's that that in god's word and now if god had just a few words there that people must obey and in them few words one of them was misrepresented cause death caused death look at the words we got today so we need all of them we need daniel 70 weeks we need christ the mystery god revealed we need who is this kid we need a paradox we need to know what the message is about we must receive every one of them hold on to them and enter into them as promises from god and a true wife of god will do that true engaged espoused one now i hope these little things go down deep now so we can catch them what was the first thing that caused eve to disbelieve god's word it was because satan promised her more wisdom you will be wise now you see the human race is always reaching after something and eve was reaching after more wisdom now let's stop just one minute isn't that the condition of the world today they want more wisdom better class higher educated wanting something that's different more wisdom that's what he wanted but let me say this also that there is no wisdom can surpass gods yes it's in such a humble form that people miss it so what's he saying take god at his word we you i think one of the greatest deceptions around today is that is that we don't need we don't need these things but he's saying we've got look at the words we've got today we need everything that's in the message now that's why uh paul in hebrews chapter four exhorted us let us therefore fear let's say let's have a little fear let's let's come into with with reverence and respect and uh he said lest the promise being left of us enter left us of us entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and then them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my arrest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if the musicians can go ahead and come and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest and we'll find rest as we dive into this a little bit more rest comes from knowing god's word all right god bless you
