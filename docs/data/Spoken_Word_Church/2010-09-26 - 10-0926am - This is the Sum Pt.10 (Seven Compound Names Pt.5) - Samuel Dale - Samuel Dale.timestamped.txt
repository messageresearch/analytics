[32:11] reading from Hebrews 8 and Ecclesiastes
[32:16] 12 forgive me got to group it this
[32:19] morning amen so just remember these that
[32:23] are away today remember the Labby Grace
[32:25] I know you have but she's running a
[32:28] temperature and all yesterday and things
[32:30] old sinus congestion and but she'd be
[32:34] all right but just keep praying for her
[32:37] that the Lord would would take care of
[32:39] everything and also remember brother
[32:41] dick and gaale he had some problems with
[32:43] his truck you know we were praying that
[32:47] they Gail asked you know to pray that
[32:49] the truck would be able to to go and
[32:51] burn back well when they got down I
[32:53] think it's about eala that somebody
[32:55] stopped them and told them that they
[32:57] were were blowing oil out you know the
[32:59] car the truck and and if hadn't it would
[33:01] have blowed up you know and burn it up
[33:03] or or start destroyed the motor but they
[33:06] got they got it fixed as far as I know
[33:08] when I talked to him Friday I guess it
[33:10] was and they were getting it fixed and
[33:12] and all so you know the Lord is still
[33:14] with us no matter what we think we think
[33:16] well now you ought to be able to drive
[33:18] down there and back with no wall in it
[33:19] well that's all right he can do that too
[33:22] you know he can do that that's no
[33:24] problem but he just does it his way
[33:27] so we accept his way of doing it so just
[33:29] remember that White's over with brother

[35:00] with it but we realize and know that we
[35:03] have nothing to do with whatsoever it is
[35:06] it all comes from you and is all
[35:08] free that you give it unto us freely we
[35:11] thank you and just have your way bless
[35:12] all of these that we've asked to
[35:14] remember and just be with each one Lord
[35:17] and just have your way that the Lord
[35:19] would guide each one and we pray that
[35:21] you'd be here today with us as we try to
[35:24] speak about your word that you would
[35:26] come Lord and speak to each one touch
[35:28] the lby there with the temperature and
[35:30] dismiss it from her and all Lord we
[35:32] believe you thank you for all things
[35:35] Brother Ray leg we believe everything is
[35:37] all right and just have your way in
[35:40] Jesus name
[35:43] amen
[35:45] Hebrews
[35:50] 81 now of the things which we have
[35:53] spoken this is the
[35:55] PS we have such an high priest who is
[35:58] set on the right hand of the Throne of
[36:01] the Majesty in the heavens now you can
[36:03] go on down and read and see who this is
[36:05] we know it's about Jesus because he's
[36:07] the minister of the sanctuary but just
[36:09] getting the point you know that Paul is
[36:11] summing up all he said and then saying
[36:14] this is the sum of it we have such a
[36:16] great one a high priest all right
[36:21] Ecclesiastes 12 and verse
[36:23] 13 Ecclesiastes finishing up his
[36:26] conclusion of the matter and he says let
[36:28] us hear the conclusion of the whole
[36:31] matter fear God and keep his
[36:34] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[36:37] of man you may be seated to the Lord at
[36:39] his Blessing to the reading of the
[36:47] word yes
[36:50] sir I don't see boy or any of there he
[36:54] is sitting over the corner J is a
[36:57] Jason leaving is uh Ashley's husband
[37:01] leaving next Friday next Friday I
[37:05] thought I thought he was leaving pretty
[37:07] quick to go overseas so just remember
[37:10] that and keep him in your prayers I
[37:12] wanted to read a a little testimony to
[37:15] you I asked the sister to give it
[37:16] herself but she didn't want to so I said
[37:19] you just write it down and this is this
[37:21] is about Mary Gabriel but she didn't
[37:23] want me to put her name on it okay so
[37:27] this is this is about Merit okay and
[37:30] it's was a wonderful testimony I thank
[37:32] God says Friday night the weekend of the
[37:35] banquet in North Carolina me Joyce and
[37:37] hope were sitting around talking in the
[37:39] hotel room and I suddenly noticed a spot
[37:44] or something in my vision and
[37:46] considering the previous eye problems
[37:48] I've had any other time I've seen spots
[37:51] in my vision it always meant that my
[37:54] retina had become detached
[37:57] so my first
[37:58] reaction quicker than anything was
[38:02] fear I remember looking at Joyce and
[38:04] only being able to see hi her face but I
[38:08] tried not to let it bother me so I laid
[38:11] down and I place my right hand over my
[38:15] right eye and asked the Lord to touch me
[38:17] and heal me of whatever it was that was
[38:20] causing this spot to come in up in my
[38:23] vision and when I woke up the next
[38:25] morning
[38:27] thank the Lord it was gone I haven't had
[38:30] any more problems with it since that
[38:32] night Hallelujah the devil keeps trying
[38:34] to tell me that it was nothing and that
[38:37] it would have just went away on its own
[38:40] but I won't listen and continue to give
[38:42] God the glory for it every day
[38:48] amen
[38:49] am wa got a testimony amen okay now
[38:55] we've been talking about the seven
[38:57] compound names of of
[39:00] Jehovah and trying to get it together to
[39:04] where that we can uh see it in the way
[39:08] that I believe God wants us to to see it
[39:12] and uh forgive me for repeating a lot
[39:16] but uh I believe repetitive things is
[39:20] necessary because when we were in school
[39:22] we didn't go to school one day and they
[39:24] said 1 + 1 equal 2 then we went day two
[39:28] 2 + 2 = 4 day three no you didn't do
[39:31] that did you every day you kept going
[39:34] back even when you got up into
[39:37] algebra you know and you got into
[39:40] trigonometry and and all of the things
[39:42] that would go with the mathematical
[39:45] forms you still saying what 1 + 1 = 2 2
[39:49] + 2al 4 so it's not a problem for me to
[39:52] repeat things as Paul said one day
[39:55] because I believe it's necess necessary
[39:57] for us to to understand right now what
[40:00] have we been talking
[40:02] about that the prophet of God said I
[40:05] gave you the quotes on it if anybody
[40:06] needs them uh send me an email or
[40:08] anything I on the internet ways uh you
[40:11] know send me an email be glad to give
[40:13] them to a year backup a few services and
[40:14] you'll find
[40:15] them but the prophet of God says you
[40:18] cannot
[40:20] separate any of those seven compound
[40:23] names of
[40:24] Jehovah because they all are in Jesus
[40:28] Christ now if he was one of those seven
[40:32] compound names it would be necessary
[40:36] then that he be all the other and as I
[40:39] tried you know going through in the
[40:41] series talking about it there's a whole
[40:43] lot more things in there that you can go
[40:45] through you know that you can get into
[40:47] the the uh you know the Ros of Sharon
[40:50] and Lily of the Valley the bright and
[40:51] Morning Star but it's really all
[40:55] contained with with in the seven
[40:58] compound names of Jehovah you know
[41:00] Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Tish you all the
[41:02] way through and uh it's all contain
[41:05] therein and you cannot look at one
[41:08] greater than the
[41:10] other see see that's our problem I'm I'm
[41:14] trying to get it to you I'm trying to
[41:16] get it to me okay so you listen to me
[41:19] talk to myself see we we put more
[41:22] emphasis upon Jehovah Gyra saying the
[41:26] Lord is our
[41:28] sacrifice and then we kind of downgrade
[41:31] it over a little bit as we may be sorry
[41:34] for the language but this human we kind
[41:36] of put it down a little lower to talk
[41:39] about Jehovah RFI as our
[41:42] healer and I told you the reason I keep
[41:45] saying that is what it's true I think
[41:48] that we don't dare go around and saying
[41:50] well I don't know whether I'm saved or
[41:52] not I think I'm saved maybe I'm saved
[41:53] maybe I'm well I don't know things works
[41:55] out pretty good you know if I get
[41:57] feeling good I'm saved you know we don't
[41:58] say stuff like that do
[42:00] we we don't try to take anything in
[42:03] against the fact that we're
[42:06] saved right all right but then we'll
[42:09] take in all kind of things against the
[42:11] fact that we're
[42:16] healed we listen to the doctor and thank
[42:18] God for them but we listen to them above
[42:21] the word the word says we're healed that
[42:25] doesn't mean you don't go to the doctor
[42:27] see that's that's what the truth is so
[42:29] hard to preach brother brandom out there
[42:31] you know praying for the sick and I
[42:33] remember seemed like a 62 the Jehovah
[42:36] gyus series I believe it's in California
[42:38] but anyhow he was preaching and the sick
[42:41] was being healed all kind of Miracles
[42:44] were taking place and you know what he
[42:45] was doing he's going to doctor every
[42:49] day because of his stomach
[42:52] problem that he was very sick well boy
[42:55] he didn't down no
[42:57] faith well now you going to talk to God
[42:59] about that so that's all right you go
[43:02] talk to God to see who's got faith and
[43:03] who ain't and when Jesus raised a little
[43:06] boy from the dead and sat on a rock and
[43:08] grown of a headache you go talk to God
[43:10] about whether or not he had
[43:12] Faith all right see that's where we want
[43:14] to prop everything up you know make some
[43:18] special case about ourselves you know or
[43:21] some kind of thing and that's where our
[43:22] trouble is
[43:24] right we don't put put the fact that
[43:27] Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah rapi is in the
[43:30] same atonement cuz the prophet said you
[43:33] cannot preach salvation without
[43:36] preaching healing and you cannot preach
[43:39] healing without preaching salvation
[43:43] amen well brother d by stripes with heal
[43:46] right but if he hadn't went to Calvary I
[43:48] keep making that statement I hope it'll
[43:50] don't on you if he had went to Calvary
[43:53] and paid the price that beating on his
[43:55] back would have been no
[43:57] good it would have been worthless right
[44:01] you see you should and talk like that
[44:02] why not it gets the point across to
[44:05] you because healing is in the atonement
[44:08] of
[44:10] Calvary you can't separate it wounded
[44:12] for our transgression bruised for our
[44:14] iniquity with his stripes we healed you
[44:17] can't separate it you got to put it
[44:19] together but that's what I'm saying we
[44:21] make one more than the
[44:23] other
[44:25] why
[44:27] why would we do that why would we get on
[44:30] in like we're going today on on Jehovah
[44:33] T
[44:35] you the Lord is our
[44:38] righteousness now you going to make that
[44:40] less than our
[44:45] sacrifice well I just you know I just
[44:47] can't see really what you're saying well
[44:49] that's what I'm
[44:52] saying there shouldn't be any problem
[44:54] about what I say now there might be a
[44:56] problem about what you understand about
[44:58] it but there shouldn't be any problem
[45:00] about what I
[45:02] say I'm trying my best to be as blunt as
[45:05] I
[45:06] can that without him being Jehovah
[45:13] jyra our provided
[45:16] sacrifice what good would it be for
[45:19] being a banner or a or a peace or
[45:21] righteousness or any what what would it
[45:23] be if he's not our savior
[45:26] all
[45:28] right now here's the point I try to make
[45:30] across I'm not preaching against what
[45:32] somebody else believes that's their
[45:33] business I'm just trying to tell you the
[45:35] truth amen then it would all have to be
[45:38] based upon who died at Calvary
[45:45] right all of the seven compound names
[45:47] would have to be based upon who that
[45:52] was and if that was not God that died on
[45:55] Calvary
[46:00] then we're we're still in our
[46:02] sin we have no more than anybody else
[46:05] has we have a
[46:11] philosophy but if that was God that
[46:14] died then there's hopes that he can be
[46:17] our sacrifice
[46:19] amen by accepting him right all right
[46:23] then if he is our sacrifice he can be
[46:25] our healer
[46:28] see what you say but brother Dale see
[46:31] that's what we do we we take and say
[46:33] well brother Dale brother so and so said
[46:35] that his God couldn't die well what's
[46:38] that got to do with it your Prophet said
[46:41] God
[46:44] died well no no God can't I got quotes
[46:48] where God can't die yeah well what about
[46:50] the quotes where he did what about the
[46:53] quotes where he took upon himself the
[46:55] human realm to live with
[46:57] us and die that you and I might have it
[47:01] because if he didn't
[47:03] die then how could his life come back
[47:06] upon
[47:08] us if that was a
[47:10] man now I know what their their
[47:13] statements I know what your Prophet said
[47:16] but if that was a man that died on
[47:19] Calvary then some way in the world we're
[47:21] going to have to find Salvation after we
[47:23] get out of this world because there's no
[47:25] way in this world that a man can die for
[47:27] another man right amen so you better
[47:30] start your Doctrine somewhere about how
[47:33] it's going to be great when we get over
[47:35] there you
[47:38] know see I'm just just as honest as I
[47:40] can be about it to try to get you to see
[47:43] if God didn't
[47:45] die then we have no savior that's
[47:51] right he said but brother Dale God can't
[47:54] die I know the
[47:58] story but it's like I try my best to
[48:01] preach to you when that body was born
[48:04] that was a creation God created a body
[48:06] to come down and live
[48:08] in and he came and lived in that body at
[48:11] the
[48:12] birth cuz your Bible said born this day
[48:16] in the city of David is a
[48:18] savior which is Christ the
[48:23] Lord he was Emmanuel God with us amen
[48:28] sure we know what happened at the River
[48:29] Jordan that's when the fullness that's
[48:31] when all things came because he couldn't
[48:33] die for for you and I as a
[48:35] baby he couldn't die for us at 12 or 13
[48:38] years old when he could talk to the to
[48:40] the people at the temple he couldn't die
[48:42] first at that time cuz he was not
[48:44] anointed to be that to to finish it all
[48:49] up all right but see on Mount there I
[48:52] mean there on River Jordan he became the
[48:54] anointed became anointed your Prophet
[48:58] said now how can an anointed become
[49:00] anointed I don't know ask brother
[49:03] brand all but you see trying to be
[49:08] straight and honest about it people
[49:10] think I'm hateful in the basis of what
[49:12] I'm do I am hateful in one
[49:14] thing if me and you don't get this
[49:16] pretty
[49:17] quick yeah hey I'm looking at a lot of
[49:21] 65 and 70 year old
[49:24] people that a few more years
[49:28] folks somebody better be ready to take
[49:31] over because we ain't going to be around
[49:34] here very much
[49:36] longer so we better get serious about
[49:39] what it is
[49:41] now and then some of you in the 50s is
[49:44] pushing
[49:47] it
[49:49] see but see church I'm just trying to
[49:52] get you to see who what happened at
[49:54] Calvary
[49:57] God came down and lived in that baby yes
[50:01] Soul and Spirit came into that body and
[50:05] live made him God
[50:08] Emmanuel but one day that Soul and
[50:11] Spirit left out of that
[50:13] body Jesus said into thy hand I Comm in
[50:15] my
[50:17] spirit it left out of the body that's
[50:20] what died the body then went to to the
[50:23] grave and laid there for three days
[50:25] while the very soul theop of God your
[50:28] Prophet said went to hell to speak to
[50:30] the souls in prison he came back up
[50:33] raised up the body and went up and that
[50:35] same God the prophet said come back on
[50:37] the day of Pentecost in the form of the
[50:39] baptism of the Holy
[50:41] Ghost there's our sacrifice yes I'm
[50:45] talking about an eternal
[50:47] God that would make a
[50:50] way your Prophet said he'd made his a
[50:53] way by coming himself
[50:56] he didn't send somebody else he came
[50:59] himself to
[51:02] die to release that life that it could
[51:05] come back upon us and he could be
[51:07] Jehovah
[51:09] Gyra then if he can be Jehovah
[51:13] Gyra now don't downgrade anything for
[51:16] the rest of the things that we're
[51:17] talking about in other words don't make
[51:19] them
[51:20] smaller what I'm telling you that we're
[51:22] doing we take what the doctor said what
[51:26] the the you know somebody as quick as
[51:28] somebody get something what you do now
[51:30] we become our own
[51:33] doctors I won't call her name she might
[51:36] do like to me to say things about it a
[51:38] certain sister one time was at the
[51:39] doctor and this I best I can remember
[51:42] almost the exact wording of it but the
[51:44] doctor said you're that lady that
[51:45] doctors
[51:47] yourself cuz you know what we
[51:50] do what happens when you get sick what
[51:53] happens now when you get sick you run
[51:55] into the the computer you type it
[51:59] in and then you start reading
[52:03] right the doctor tells you something you
[52:06] used to the doctor said you got to you
[52:08] know hle hery I didn't know what in the
[52:11] world it was if he told me I had
[52:15] one what's it matter I just need
[52:18] something for it but see I don't
[52:22] H everybody's got I don't H everybody
[52:25] got this everybody's got that you
[52:27] know well see we're not taking God to
[52:30] just say by his stripes I'm
[52:32] Healed now when the Salvation comes up
[52:34] do you run the quotes to try to find
[52:36] your
[52:38] salvation now this is about four
[52:40] Services I've been heavy on that I know
[52:42] it but do you do
[52:45] that do you run the quotes up into the
[52:47] prophet's message to find out if you're
[52:53] saved no no no I'm
[52:56] saved well why run the quotes up with
[52:58] the doctors to find out whether you're
[53:00] healed or
[53:05] not but you see we take what the doctor
[53:07] says and wonderful thank God for it
[53:11] that's what I asked sister Kathy this
[53:12] morning I said Brother Ray go and I hope
[53:14] he's hearing this if he is get your hard
[53:16] head over there to the doctor and let
[53:18] him run and check your leg out to see if
[53:20] you got any problems I'll pay for it if
[53:22] you need it let them look at good X-ray
[53:25] on it check the thing
[53:27] over you'll call in a few
[53:32] minutes nothing wrong with going to the
[53:34] doctor
[53:37] right what's wrong with
[53:41] it but ain't no need now brother Ray for
[53:43] you to run in the computer while we're
[53:45] talking to see what what happened if you
[53:47] fall three foot or 4ot or 8
[53:50] foot see we get it all tied up we become
[53:53] up to where we don't really just accept
[53:54] what God
[53:57] says God says I'm healed amen that's
[54:01] right God says I'm Healed let me say I'm
[54:06] Healed all right go down to the doctor
[54:09] and the doctor looks you over and he
[54:10] says hey you got s good do now give me
[54:12] something for it help
[54:16] me well but you understand what I've
[54:20] been trying to drive at now yes I know
[54:22] I'm hitting it hard but I'm I'm trying
[54:24] to drive it within my own brain as well
[54:27] as yours that's right there is no
[54:29] difference in what the value of each one
[54:32] what would it be brother Al was talking
[54:34] to him about the other day he had a good
[54:35] point he said it's all just one
[54:39] package Jehovah Jehovah
[54:42] Jehovah it's all in one
[54:46] package it's all in Jesus
[54:50] Christ all right let's don't value one
[54:52] over the
[54:54] other
[54:55] because somewhere out of
[54:59] this now I'm go ahead and make a
[55:01] statement where you can think about it
[55:03] all of the compound names of Jehovah now
[55:06] listen all
[55:08] right our Old
[55:10] Testament definitions all right
[55:13] words now we use something in you cuz we
[55:15] La it over but get what I'm talking
[55:20] about now I haven't found one
[55:24] yet
[55:26] now everybody
[55:28] listening I haven't found one yet out of
[55:31] the seven compound names of
[55:33] Jehovah that deals specifically with a
[55:36] change of the
[55:43] body I'm open for
[55:47] comments all of them are Earthly or
[55:50] whatever you call it now forgive me all
[55:53] of them are dealing with a while we're
[55:55] here on
[55:56] Earth
[55:59] okay so we're going to have to go above
[56:01] this
[56:04] righten but it won't be above
[56:06] this it'll have to come out of
[56:10] this because now what have we been
[56:12] talking
[56:14] about the reason you know he's Jehovah
[56:16] Gyra is because of a personal experience
[56:21] of Salvation within your soul amen right
[56:25] that's right all right now then if that
[56:28] be true why can't we
[56:32] believe that the healing is based upon
[56:35] the individual person now we're not
[56:38] talking about healing for
[56:40] everybody right cuz that's not what they
[56:43] believe but it's still coming from a a
[56:46] connection through their inner being for
[56:48] them to be able to
[56:49] believe but see the connection we need
[56:52] to make is that soul that says that I'm
[56:55] already
[56:58] saved and then when are we going to get
[57:00] to the basis to say I'm just as healed
[57:03] as I'm
[57:06] saved and Let It Come From the Inside
[57:10] Out amen your Prophet said your
[57:12] Resurrection lies within
[57:15] you that's right come
[57:18] on but you see then the Rapture will
[57:21] have to come out
[57:23] of what we're the brain that's
[57:28] right but if we don't get it in the
[57:30] correct
[57:31] order come on if I'm wrong show me take
[57:35] all the compound
[57:38] names and show me where it's tied to the
[57:46] Rapture you're going to have to get this
[57:48] Rapture first what resurrected sitting
[57:51] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[57:53] that's the first part you got to get
[57:55] right that's if we don't get that
[57:58] right then if we got it right in here
[58:01] why can't we believe the body is just as
[58:04] healed as our soul is
[58:07] saved amen now if that don't don't on
[58:11] you don't hit you hard enough I'll keep
[58:14] saying it over and
[58:16] over because it's true right we put more
[58:21] emphasis upon our Salvation than we put
[58:23] Upon Our healing that's right
[58:25] but the scripture said the same God that
[58:28] died for me also healed
[58:32] me now see we're in our ways we say oh
[58:37] no no Brother D we don't want Jesus to
[58:40] get back up on AC Cross or we don't want
[58:42] him beat
[58:44] again but
[58:46] subconsciously that's what we're
[58:50] saying we're saying that subconsciously
[58:53] within us that he needs to do something
[58:58] else now what else can he
[59:01] do he said his word that healed
[59:05] us is that
[59:07] true now but think on these things
[59:10] see if one of the seven compound names
[59:14] applies to Jesus all must apply and all
[59:17] must apply with equal
[59:23] quality
[59:25] no Brother D I believe we need to have a
[59:28] I believe we need to be saved but it's
[59:31] not necessary for that saving and
[59:34] healing to come under the same well now
[59:36] you show me where that's
[59:39] at well we don't maybe need him as our
[59:42] Banner our
[59:44] Shield as much as we do our Salvation
[59:47] now what kind of a mentality do you have
[59:49] let alone spiritual
[59:53] revelation
[59:57] if he's the same yesterday today and
[59:58] forever then we better believe it but
[1:00:02] are you following me now I'll keep
[1:00:04] repeating that I'm sorry but that's just
[1:00:06] what I want to do but you see it all
[1:00:09] depends upon who it was that died at
[1:00:12] Calvary
[1:00:15] right it all depends upon who was
[1:00:20] beat because if you don't understand
[1:00:23] you're missing it cuz you're saying that
[1:00:25] we're beat that the beating of Jesus
[1:00:28] healed
[1:00:29] us well what are you saying saved
[1:00:34] us are you going to make up two persons
[1:00:37] two
[1:00:40] identities
[1:00:42] no if they're not the same then you
[1:00:45] don't have the
[1:00:47] same well brother so and so I don't care
[1:00:50] if everybody in the message listen folks
[1:00:52] I don't went too far I don't care if all
[1:00:54] of you leave I don't I mean I don't say
[1:00:56] it wrong now I'm say it in the best way
[1:00:58] that I can I don't care if everybody in
[1:01:00] the world differs with me I still
[1:01:01] believe
[1:01:03] God my family my my kids my wife and
[1:01:06] everything grandkids and great grand if
[1:01:09] you don't agree with me that's that's up
[1:01:10] to
[1:01:11] you my
[1:01:13] God is
[1:01:15] real thank you he's not ative of your
[1:01:19] imagination
[1:01:21] amen and he's just as much Jehovah J
[1:01:25] and he's just as much Jehovah RI he's
[1:01:28] just as much as any of those compound
[1:01:30] names as we're going through because the
[1:01:32] pointed I've been making what he would
[1:01:35] not do us any good to be Beat to Death
[1:01:38] there on while he was
[1:01:39] alive had it not been for the fact that
[1:01:43] he went to Calvary and died to pay the
[1:01:45] price because the healing is not in the
[1:01:48] chemistry of the blood that's
[1:01:51] right it's the faith in the blood is
[1:01:53] what heals you amen it's the life of God
[1:01:56] that must come forth because only God
[1:01:59] can create Sals to heal you that's right
[1:02:02] amen the doctor sets the bone but he
[1:02:04] can't heal
[1:02:05] it like I was giving our the other night
[1:02:07] where brother around and said take
[1:02:09] somebody that's got a sword on them and
[1:02:11] then bomb them you know get them ready
[1:02:13] go to the
[1:02:15] Grave he said you go out there every day
[1:02:17] he said you shoot pen aying in there he
[1:02:19] said it won't heal it
[1:02:23] right I want it because it does before
[1:02:25] you
[1:02:27] die no because there something wrong see
[1:02:30] the
[1:02:31] life is
[1:02:33] gone it's the life of God that we must
[1:02:35] have within us amen that's right not a
[1:02:38] concept or an
[1:02:41] idea it's the
[1:02:45] life and then with the life comes the
[1:02:50] healing all of these must apply to Jesus
[1:02:53] Christ okay
[1:02:56] now let's get into the next one which is
[1:02:57] Jehovah
[1:02:59] tiu if you'd like turning your
[1:03:01] scriptures turn to to uh Jeremiah 23 but
[1:03:07] let me say this while we're going
[1:03:08] through now I've tried to explain it CU
[1:03:10] somebody out there hears it and then
[1:03:12] they wonder what's going on they don't
[1:03:13] know what they're talking
[1:03:15] about Jehovah TI can you is spell two
[1:03:17] different
[1:03:20] ways you run it through and you get into
[1:03:22] your your uh in system and computers and
[1:03:25] everything you'll find it spelled two
[1:03:28] different ways one of them is t s i d k
[1:03:32] n
[1:03:36] e the other one is spelled TS i d q e
[1:03:42] n
[1:03:44] u all right just to make sure that you
[1:03:48] like I said you won't find a lot of
[1:03:49] these in the Bible written
[1:03:53] out but but it's verified by the prophet
[1:03:55] because he was the one that was telling
[1:03:57] us about the seven compound names of
[1:03:59] Jehovah right all right but look at
[1:04:05] Jeremiah
[1:04:07] right and let's see what this is
[1:04:10] Jeremiah
[1:04:15] 23 verse
[1:04:20] 5 behold the days come sayth the Lord
[1:04:25] that I will raise unto David A righteous
[1:04:29] Branch all right now this is speaking of
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:32] restoration of David to the throne in
[1:04:35] the Millennium to rule as you know David
[1:04:40] Son of David speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:04:42] right the branch that will be in the
[1:04:44] Millennium was the promise to David that
[1:04:47] his son would sit on the throne Solomon
[1:04:50] in the natural ascended to the throne of
[1:04:53] David but that that was not the promise
[1:04:55] that you keep reading back there it was
[1:04:57] the promise of Jesus Christ all right
[1:05:01] now the branch cuz you run that all the
[1:05:02] way through the scripture of the
[1:05:06] branch David A righteous Branch a king
[1:05:09] shall reign and prosper and shall ex
[1:05:12] execute judgment and Justice in the
[1:05:15] earth in his days Judah shall be saved
[1:05:20] and Israel shall dwell
[1:05:22] safely and this is the name whereby he
[1:05:26] shall be
[1:05:28] called that's where they get it now
[1:05:30] Jehovah tishu which is the Lord our
[1:05:36] righteousness now that's a
[1:05:40] promise that the son of David is going
[1:05:44] to sit on the throne in the
[1:05:47] Millennium because he's going to rule as
[1:05:51] king all right now but see he is our
[1:05:57] King by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:00] because we are the children of God we're
[1:06:03] the offsprings of the
[1:06:05] king see all right so now the natural is
[1:06:10] going over but see the spiritual is
[1:06:13] staying here because Psalms 50 and6 says
[1:06:16] the heaven shall declare his
[1:06:20] righteousness amen the heavens will
[1:06:22] declare it right sir
[1:06:25] when this takes place let's read on down
[1:06:27] go to verse 7 and you'll see what I'm
[1:06:29] saying therefore behold the days come
[1:06:33] now that's the Millennium see in the
[1:06:36] natural now watch behold the days come
[1:06:40] sayth the Lord that they shall no more
[1:06:44] say the Lord liveth which brought up the
[1:06:47] children of Israel out of the land of
[1:06:51] Egypt
[1:06:53] now look at the next verse they won't
[1:06:56] say
[1:06:59] that a day comes that you won't say the
[1:07:03] Lord liveth that brought up the children
[1:07:04] of Israel out of the land of Egypt cuz
[1:07:08] that could be done back there when they
[1:07:09] come up out of the land of
[1:07:11] Egypt all right but what verse eight but
[1:07:16] now what's going to be said but the Lord
[1:07:20] liveth which brought up and which left
[1:07:24] the seat of the House of Israel out of
[1:07:26] the North Country listen and from all
[1:07:31] countries whether I had driven them and
[1:07:35] they shall dwell in their own land
[1:07:36] that's exactly what's taking place right
[1:07:42] now it won't be just said that God
[1:07:45] brought them out of
[1:07:48] Egypt it will be said God has now put
[1:07:52] them back into the home land
[1:07:57] right all right now they got to be in
[1:08:00] the Homeland before the millennial rign
[1:08:02] can take
[1:08:03] place see so it just keeps right on
[1:08:07] going but who is it said the Lord
[1:08:10] who the Lord our
[1:08:14] righteousness all right now if he's your
[1:08:19] savior Jehovah
[1:08:22] J if he is your
[1:08:25] savior then you don't have any
[1:08:27] righteousness of your own
[1:08:29] right cuz the Bible says my
[1:08:31] righteousness is filthy rags that's
[1:08:35] right but his
[1:08:40] righteousness all right to declare
[1:08:44] Romans 3 and 26 or
[1:08:47] 25 because someone has to declare his
[1:08:52] righteousness
[1:08:57] now you see where we was at back few
[1:09:00] weeks
[1:09:03] ago where the prophet of God in the
[1:09:05] church age book was talking about the
[1:09:08] righteousness and if we ac accept the
[1:09:11] fact that he died for
[1:09:14] us by our Union with US 31 Church age
[1:09:17] book we have become the very
[1:09:19] righteousness of God because we're not
[1:09:22] the Jews waiting for the Millennium
[1:09:24] that's a natural
[1:09:26] things but just showing you how
[1:09:28] wonderful God's promise is that he
[1:09:31] promis now I brought him up out of Egypt
[1:09:34] that was showing his righteousness but
[1:09:36] that's not all of it that I'm going to
[1:09:39] put him in the land back where they come
[1:09:41] from all if you notice in verse uh
[1:09:46] 8 and from all
[1:09:49] countries
[1:09:51] right everywhere around
[1:09:54] and that's what I enjoyed about the
[1:09:55] brother that was here that was you know
[1:09:58] brother Solomon Solomon you pronounced
[1:10:02] it that if you're a Jew and connected
[1:10:05] with a certain amount of
[1:10:08] bloodline right today you just call them
[1:10:13] up and they'll come and get
[1:10:16] you they'll pay your
[1:10:19] ticket and take you
[1:10:22] home and he said you don't have to apply
[1:10:25] for
[1:10:26] citizenship you don't have to do like we
[1:10:28] do in America wait 15 years to do
[1:10:30] something and go through all of these
[1:10:31] time he said when you land in
[1:10:34] Israel they will hand you
[1:10:38] unquestionable your
[1:10:42] citizenship that's how much they're
[1:10:44] wanting to bring the people home now I
[1:10:47] didn't ask him so I don't know how much
[1:10:48] you got to be a Jew but that's like I've
[1:10:51] told you waiting in my turn Oklahoma
[1:10:53] they know that brother CLA and them if
[1:10:55] you're 1/8 of a certain tribe of Indians
[1:10:57] out there if you're just 1/8 now that's
[1:10:58] a long way back you know 1/8 you can get
[1:11:01] your medical bills you can get all kind
[1:11:03] of things taken care of if you're just
[1:11:05] one
[1:11:07] 18 but see Israel thinks so much of it
[1:11:10] they want their people
[1:11:15] home but listen that's only the natural
[1:11:19] story David in the natural Story coming
[1:11:22] out of Egypt in the natural
[1:11:27] story don't you think that God looked
[1:11:30] down at those people and saw him
[1:11:34] righteous no no no now brother D saw
[1:11:37] what he doing well I reminds you that
[1:11:41] he when who was it bam or B one over
[1:11:44] there was trying to show God all the bad
[1:11:47] things and it said he showed them the
[1:11:48] hinder parts of Israel you know what
[1:11:51] that would mean the worst you could get
[1:11:53] right all
[1:11:55] right and the prophet said I can't see
[1:12:00] nothing is I can't see
[1:12:04] anything cuz that's the way God looks at
[1:12:06] it now we're going to start looking at
[1:12:09] things the way God looks at it and
[1:12:10] that's what I've been driving at amen if
[1:12:13] we have the new
[1:12:14] birth why can't we believe that by the
[1:12:18] new
[1:12:19] birth that he has given us that we're
[1:12:23] just as righteous as God is but now see
[1:12:26] that's where we fallen again see we're
[1:12:28] not going to take that we're
[1:12:30] righteous but we're going to still say
[1:12:32] we're
[1:12:35] saved so you got the bumper
[1:12:37] stickers I'm not I'm not perfect I'm
[1:12:42] just
[1:12:46] saved well when are you going to get
[1:12:49] perfect well when I get over
[1:12:52] there
[1:12:55] H you see what I'm
[1:12:58] doing we must get in our mind that by
[1:13:03] salvation brings a Healer within
[1:13:09] us and makes us just as
[1:13:13] righteous as he is
[1:13:18] right now if you don't then you're
[1:13:20] downgrading one of the compound names
[1:13:26] right well I've heard this over and over
[1:13:28] so I can put together the banner I'll
[1:13:30] just lay out well okay that's all right
[1:13:32] that's your
[1:13:33] business I thought about doing something
[1:13:35] the other day and you know I'm I'm kind
[1:13:38] of arrogant old guy when I do say things
[1:13:41] I guess but I thought about writing out
[1:13:44] a thing and just applying for a job and
[1:13:47] each one of you being the
[1:13:52] boss
[1:13:55] and I thought about writing out my res
[1:13:57] what you call that big old word
[1:13:59] resume you know we call it the south of
[1:14:03] Rumi a
[1:14:07] resume and give each one of you my
[1:14:10] resume and see if you would hire me to
[1:14:12] work in your
[1:14:15] company and write out all the things
[1:14:18] that I do and don't do and how many
[1:14:19] times I'm out and why I'm out and what's
[1:14:21] going on and would you me if I was going
[1:14:24] to miss 36 days in one year you
[1:14:28] know okay I'll get off of
[1:14:32] it listen folks this is not a play
[1:14:36] pry why were you so dedicated back in
[1:14:39] years ago but you're not now what's
[1:14:42] wrong but yet you still think you're
[1:14:44] just as much now see I can take the
[1:14:46] other side of the
[1:14:49] righteousness because I got them laying
[1:14:51] in my
[1:14:52] office of how that if we turn the
[1:14:54] righteousness of God in the wrong
[1:14:58] direction do you know that if we turn
[1:15:01] the righteousness of God in the wrong
[1:15:05] direction he does not have to hear our
[1:15:07] prayers
[1:15:08] that's that's
[1:15:11] Bible you know have to hear our prayers
[1:15:13] that's right well I prayed and I prayed
[1:15:16] and I prayed and they don't hear me
[1:15:19] maybe it's because we've turned from our
[1:15:22] the righteousness of God
[1:15:23] that's
[1:15:25] right I try not to be hateful I write
[1:15:28] out things but then I put them up and
[1:15:29] Don't Preach to you you think I'm but I
[1:15:32] try my best to get you to see something
[1:15:33] about his
[1:15:35] righteousness yeah but brother so and so
[1:15:37] preach righteousness and I just feel so
[1:15:44] good that's
[1:15:46] you what's the difference in the
[1:15:49] word you know if I say righteousness or
[1:15:52] I say righteousness what's the
[1:15:54] difference in the way the word comes
[1:15:59] out but
[1:16:01] listen
[1:16:02] see it's a promise now in the
[1:16:07] Bible that God will one day Reign Over
[1:16:12] Israel and that's what he's saying here
[1:16:14] in Jeremiah and you go over Jeremiah
[1:16:16] 33:16 and you'll find the same
[1:16:19] repeat that he's telling Israel one one
[1:16:23] day you will be drawn back to the
[1:16:26] Homeland and when you
[1:16:29] do now this
[1:16:31] is kind them all together when you do
[1:16:34] there'll be a Banner
[1:16:37] written prob get there today but
[1:16:40] there'll be a banner stretched out over
[1:16:42] what does it
[1:16:43] say if you was a Jew and you done what I
[1:16:45] said and they send you the money they
[1:16:47] send you everything they send you a free
[1:16:49] ticket and all the brother said and you
[1:16:52] landed Israel and there's a sign that
[1:16:54] says
[1:16:57] welcome well everybody no it means
[1:16:59] special to them cuz everybody ain't
[1:17:02] going to walk past that word welcome and
[1:17:04] reach and get in their hands their
[1:17:06] citizenship that's and become an
[1:17:08] automatic citizen with all rights of
[1:17:12] Israel that
[1:17:15] moment he'll be the banner that's what
[1:17:17] we we'll get on over okay but you see it
[1:17:20] take the millennial Reign to really
[1:17:22] bring his righteousness into the correct
[1:17:24] order cuz that's the promise to David
[1:17:27] that his son would sit on his throne
[1:17:28] that's why he becomes the son of David
[1:17:30] in the millennial rign all right
[1:17:33] now but doing that it's promised to
[1:17:38] David that his son that's not going to
[1:17:43] be Solomon in the Millennium right who
[1:17:44] is it going to be Jesus right but you
[1:17:46] know what he's going to be when we get
[1:17:49] there said why he be the son of David
[1:17:55] no it be the Lord our
[1:18:02] righteousness
[1:18:04] right that'll be his title the Lord our
[1:18:10] righteousness Jesus is our righteousness
[1:18:13] we got any at
[1:18:14] all and he's going to be king now turn
[1:18:17] over to
[1:18:19] Hebrews right where you were with the
[1:18:22] reading the eight one go back to
[1:18:27] 72 71 why you turning
[1:18:30] there for this
[1:18:32] MDC king of Salem priest of the most
[1:18:35] high God who met Abraham returning from
[1:18:38] the slaughter of the Kings and blessed
[1:18:41] him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[1:18:44] part of all first being by
[1:18:48] interpretation
[1:18:49] what king of righteousness
[1:18:55] and after that he's also king of Salem
[1:18:58] which is
[1:18:59] Jerusalem and he's king of

[1:19:25] he said now he is now King of the
[1:19:31] Saints now we don't have to wait till
[1:19:34] the headstone comes for him to be
[1:19:41] king you don't get some thought in your
[1:19:43] mind like that one of these days head

[1:19:48] saints by the new
[1:19:51] birth he is our king and you know what
[1:19:54] that makes us us his children that's
[1:19:59] right we're the Sons and Daughters of a
[1:20:03] king go to the Book of Revelations read
[1:20:05] where that it'll be Kings and Priests
[1:20:11] amen we're not only at this day by the
[1:20:14] new birth
[1:20:15] Kings and going to rule with him in the
[1:20:19] Millennium come on is your Prophet that
[1:20:22] way brought
[1:20:23] but he's already king of
[1:20:28] saints he's already our righteousness
[1:20:33] amen but when are we going to start
[1:20:35] confessing
[1:20:38] it that we're just as righteous as he is
[1:20:41] by the new birth yes but brother Dale I
[1:20:43] I do so many things
[1:20:48] wrong now you're putting it upon some
[1:20:50] form just like you're putting your head
[1:20:52] healing upon some form but yet you're
[1:20:55] not putting your
[1:20:57] salvation you will say I am
[1:21:04] saved if you're saved you're
[1:21:09] perfect if you're saved you're righteous
[1:21:12] amen I just can't see you're looking at
[1:21:15] what's out here that's right
[1:21:18] right you're looking at your body and
[1:21:20] your spirit of a human being that will
[1:21:22] have mortal
[1:21:24] problems as long as we
[1:21:27] live but when are we going to say what
[1:21:30] he
[1:21:32] says oh we're good to say I'm saved let
[1:21:36] me say what God said I'm saved let me
[1:21:38] say well God this we do that all the
[1:21:41] time right right but then you say well
[1:21:43] you're just as righteous as he
[1:21:46] is by that same salvation that you have
[1:21:48] within your soul you're just as
[1:21:50] righteous as it is now you tell me how
[1:21:51] you going to make it any other way cuz
[1:21:53] see I'm talking about an inside
[1:21:56] man amen and we're going to see this it
[1:22:00] comes out into the outside man your
[1:22:02] salvation is inside right it's in your
[1:22:05] soul right but it displays outwardly
[1:22:09] okay your healing is in your soul that's
[1:22:13] where the Healer
[1:22:15] at but it's displayed outwardly when we
[1:22:18] accept it and believe it that's why it
[1:22:20] comes like that there a click there
[1:22:22] something happens and we're
[1:22:24] healed well see the righteousness in me
[1:22:27] I have no
[1:22:31] righteousness my savior is the one
[1:22:33] that's righteous that's right but you
[1:22:36] know what he says back to
[1:22:39] me come on is that Ro is it Romans we're
[1:22:43] supposed to confess with our mouth
[1:22:44] believe with our heart that we
[1:22:47] saved well is it right according to the
[1:22:49] scripture that we're supposed to confess
[1:22:50] and
[1:22:51] believe well is it right that we're
[1:22:53] supposed to confess that we're just as
[1:22:54] righteous as he
[1:22:57] is yeah but
[1:22:59] now how can we human mors be righteous
[1:23:02] God said it that's
[1:23:04] right you want to call him a
[1:23:09] liar he's one that said we
[1:23:13] righteous but you see what I'm trying my
[1:23:17] best to do is to drive the point within
[1:23:20] you and me to where we either find out
[1:23:23] we're saved or find out we're
[1:23:25] lost that's right because we find out
[1:23:28] we're saved
[1:23:30] Hallelujah we find out we're lost we can
[1:23:32] do something about
[1:23:35] it it's not get up in heaven to find out
[1:23:38] whether we're saved or not that's
[1:23:42] right it's to find out here that's right
[1:23:46] right but you see the only way you can
[1:23:48] be saved is take what God says that's
[1:23:50] right the only way you can be right
[1:23:52] rightous
[1:23:53] perfect now is that what we were on that
[1:23:56] a few weeks
[1:23:57] ago if our righteousness the Bible says
[1:23:59] don't exceed the righteousness of the
[1:24:01] scribes and
[1:24:05] Pharisees because righteousness the
[1:24:07] definition of the word righteousness is
[1:24:09] living
[1:24:12] right that's what I was getting to a
[1:24:14] minute ago see he he gives us his
[1:24:18] righteousness and we live right and we
[1:24:21] do right do the best we can then we turn
[1:24:23] that righteousness into
[1:24:26] lasciviousness well it don't make no
[1:24:28] difference what I do cuz I'm saved
[1:24:29] anyway that proves you
[1:24:31] lost that's the best way I can say
[1:24:34] it when that thing start telling you
[1:24:37] like Sister Mary said the devil will
[1:24:39] begin to tell her oh that just like any
[1:24:41] other time just tell him you're a liar
[1:24:43] that's right you're a liar that's right
[1:24:47] I thank God for everything I drop a
[1:24:48] screw on the ground and some I find it I
[1:24:51] say thank you Lord for finding you know
[1:24:52] what the devil said the other day he
[1:24:54] said I was want to help you find it I
[1:24:55] said you didn't do
[1:25:00] it I SAR told us she didn't do
[1:25:04] it talk to him it's like you
[1:25:07] talk but you understand what I'm saying
[1:25:10] I'm trying to put it together in a form
[1:25:11] where we can understand Israel has
[1:25:14] promised that one day they will come to
[1:25:17] a millennial Reign and at that day then
[1:25:20] it will be understood by Israel who the
[1:25:23] real righteous one really
[1:25:27] is and he sits there as their savior
[1:25:31] they're all in all and they'll realize
[1:25:34] that he's
[1:25:35] King you remember in the tribulation
[1:25:38] they said where'd you get the nail
[1:25:40] prints he said I got him in the house of
[1:25:42] my
[1:25:47] friends can we say What God
[1:25:51] Says see but we immediately when we say
[1:25:54] we're righteous what
[1:25:58] happens 49 Quotes come up on your
[1:26:00] computer
[1:26:01] brain
[1:26:04] right don't be that look what you
[1:26:07] done well you know it's not based on
[1:26:09] what I done that's right

[1:26:13] don't worry about it I done preach if we
[1:26:16] say we're not s we didn't do it and we
[1:26:18] did do it then we're proven we're lost
[1:26:20] CU we're a bunch of liars right how much
[1:26:22] more do I need to preach on
[1:26:27] it you don't condemn me to sin well
[1:26:29] there's something wrong with you you're
[1:26:34] lost I was thinking about a brother the
[1:26:36] other day all i' made was one point to a
[1:26:38] brother and offended him and he left and
[1:26:41] I don't feel that I've got to go
[1:26:42] apologize cuz I told him the truth I
[1:26:46] said whether you're saved or not you'll
[1:26:48] prove it that's
[1:26:51] right he
[1:26:53] did he
[1:26:57] left he said you saying I'm not saved I
[1:27:00] said I didn't say that I said you're
[1:27:03] going to prove whether you're saved or
[1:27:04] not that's
[1:27:05] right and you know our actions is going
[1:27:08] to prove what we are we're going to
[1:27:10] prove whether we're lost or we're going
[1:27:11] to prove whether we're
[1:27:15] saved but do you understand see see he
[1:27:20] is now our King
[1:27:22] yes we don't have to wait till a
[1:27:24] millennial Reign to see him as king the
[1:27:27] day you're born
[1:27:29] again he became your king he became your
[1:27:36] head cuz he's the head of the church now
[1:27:38] I don't have to wait till the headstone
[1:27:40] comes for you to be the head that's just
[1:27:42] the headstone coming into full
[1:27:43] manifestation
[1:27:46] amen right right see that's not another
[1:27:51] New Birth
[1:27:52] right that's not accepting him in a king
[1:27:55] in a different way no no you just
[1:27:57] realize who he
[1:28:00] is king of
[1:28:04] righteousness and by being that that
[1:28:06] makes him the king of the
[1:28:08] saints that makes him Paul said the king
[1:28:11] of peace now we got the other one to get
[1:28:13] on on that
[1:28:14] right Jehovah
[1:28:18] Shalom you see what I'm trying to do yes
[1:28:22] take the word of God let's read that
[1:28:25] word of God take the prophet's message
[1:28:27] put it together to see that we don't
[1:28:30] have to wait until the time comes we can
[1:28:33] see that he already is our
[1:28:36] righteousness
[1:28:37] sir he already is our healer he already
[1:28:41] is our
[1:28:44] savior he's already our
[1:28:47] righteousness I'm not confessing how
[1:28:50] righteous I am that's right that's right
[1:28:53] cuz I know I'm not amen he's done told
[1:28:56] me I'm not that's
[1:28:58] right I got plenty other people tells me
[1:29:00] I'm not too but he done told me I'm
[1:29:06] not but you see when I confess his
[1:29:09] righteousness then he has to take my
[1:29:16] confession right right are you listening
[1:29:20] yes he takes my
[1:29:24] confession My Confession must be
[1:29:26] according to his
[1:29:29] confession so I confess that he's my
[1:29:33] righteousness he confesses that I'm
[1:29:35] righteous that's right amen see but if
[1:29:38] you go around confessing that I'm weak
[1:29:40] then God has to say you're weak when you
[1:29:43] go around saying you're sick then God
[1:29:45] has to say you're
[1:29:47] sick when you go around saying if you're
[1:29:49] lost then God has to say you're lost
[1:29:53] so then what are we
[1:29:56] doing we're confessing ourselves either
[1:29:59] into the right thing or out of that's
[1:30:01] right
[1:30:03] amen that's Jehovah tiing you the Lord
[1:30:08] our
[1:30:09] righteousness it didn't say there now
[1:30:12] listen I'm trying to get this to a point
[1:30:14] it didn't say there in Jeremiah the Lord
[1:30:18] is
[1:30:19] righteous they didn't say that
[1:30:23] right they said the Lord our
[1:30:27] righteousness we know he's
[1:30:29] righteous
[1:30:33] right but see when he said the Lord I
[1:30:36] righteous means that righteousness has
[1:30:39] been
[1:30:44] imparted it means it's been transferred
[1:30:47] from
[1:30:48] him to you and me amen amen
[1:30:52] now why can't we
[1:30:54] say I'm just as perfect as he is
[1:31:01] right was life in the other
[1:31:03] day in the paper it had maybe some of
[1:31:07] you read it and it had a thing
[1:31:09] that over in England or something they
[1:31:13] was going to give the poor people money
[1:31:16] you know I'm just putting it
[1:31:19] in and you know what the queen when over
[1:31:22] she wanted to get the
[1:31:28] money of course that won't be talked
[1:31:30] about no more you know shut all that up
[1:31:33] but she want you know she's
[1:31:36] poor she could show you on the records
[1:31:39] that where they was you know they
[1:31:40] running out of money but you
[1:31:44] understand they we're easily and
[1:31:49] quick you know to accept our our General
[1:31:52] Motors
[1:31:54] retirement
[1:31:56] right we're easy and quick to accept our
[1:32:00] social
[1:32:01] security you
[1:32:03] know and all of that the only one that I
[1:32:06] don't want is the $250 check you get and
[1:32:08] you
[1:32:09] die cuz I don't want that one cuz that's
[1:32:12] all you going to get from your Social
[1:32:13] Security it's 250 bucks now that's going
[1:32:16] to bury you is it that won't even
[1:32:17] cremate you that won't even build a
[1:32:20] bonfire
[1:32:22] but my point what is
[1:32:25] it you know what you got to do to be
[1:32:28] able to get General Motors
[1:32:31] retirement what is you got to
[1:32:34] do you not only got to prove who you are
[1:32:37] you got to confess who you
[1:32:40] are cuz if you go down there and lay
[1:32:42] down the papers brother collie take his
[1:32:43] papers in and lay it down there the sign
[1:32:45] you know James call birth certificate
[1:32:47] they say this is you
[1:32:50] and I'm not
[1:32:53] say well who is
[1:32:59] this no no no no no no
[1:33:03] no we say that that's
[1:33:06] me like I used to do when I was early
[1:33:08] years I had to go cuz we had a family
[1:33:10] bible didn't even know I had a birth
[1:33:12] certificate found out it did but we had
[1:33:14] a family Bible and there was 13 of us
[1:33:18] and I'm the baby of 13 and I'd lay that
[1:33:21] down that I did to get my driver's
[1:33:23] license and they said it's good I mean
[1:33:26] CU they'll accept that quicker now they
[1:33:27] will a birth certificate I that's
[1:33:29] truthful they'll accept a family bible
[1:33:31] now quicker they will burst they'll
[1:33:33] accept the fact that you've been
[1:33:34] baptized somewhere and a record's been
[1:33:35] made of your baptism quicker they'll
[1:33:37] accept your birth certificate right now
[1:33:41] but see they would say well which one
[1:33:43] are
[1:33:45] you I
[1:33:47] said no problem I just pointed the
[1:33:49] bottom I said the baby of the
[1:33:53] crowd well see if I had to confess that
[1:33:56] what would I
[1:33:57] got well which one's you we want to give
[1:33:59] driver's license to one of these 13
[1:34:01] we're not going to give all
[1:34:04] 13 right do you get the
[1:34:08] point we must confess that we're
[1:34:13] righteous we know how
[1:34:16] now and we know our lives don't have
[1:34:18] anything to do with it if we're you're
[1:34:21] doing sin we're
[1:34:25] lost that's blunt plain we're
[1:34:29] lost but we're doing the best we can do
[1:34:32] humanly
[1:34:33] possible and then depending upon his
[1:34:37] righteousness well now that puts Works
[1:34:39] in it I put it to you before and I don't
[1:34:41] mind it you're not saved by works no
[1:34:46] sery you're saved by grace through faith
[1:34:49] but once you get born again you reach a
[1:34:52] conditional situation that says You must
[1:34:55] repent of what you do wrong if you don't
[1:34:58] you're going to have to answer to God
[1:35:00] somewhere now that's the Bible in your
[1:35:03] prophet's message that's right so which
[1:35:06] one we going to
[1:35:10] confess we're going to have to say who
[1:35:12] we are
[1:35:14] right we're children of God we can say
[1:35:16] that pretty easy right I mean that's
[1:35:18] that's pretty easy to say I'm a Child of
[1:35:20] God
[1:35:23] as I was saying about the
[1:35:27] queen you know that when them children
[1:35:30] are
[1:35:33] born that they're born
[1:35:37] royalty
[1:35:39] right that's
[1:35:43] royalty born
[1:35:47] royalty they think so much of that we
[1:35:49] were talking a while ago and I'll be
[1:35:50] glad to find you the article it's in U
[1:35:54] National
[1:35:55] Geographics about how King Tut and some
[1:35:57] of them were
[1:36:01] deformed they've proved they were you
[1:36:03] know why because they had a lot of
[1:36:05] incest in the king's
[1:36:07] lineage you know why cuz they didn't
[1:36:10] want the money to spread nowhere else
[1:36:12] they wanted to keep it in the family so
[1:36:14] they had a a lot of incest and they
[1:36:16] believe by the incest you know of having
[1:36:19] children by their own children you know
[1:36:22] people out on the internet make you know
[1:36:24] I understand the word but I mean my
[1:36:25] language you might miss what I'm talking
[1:36:27] about there was a lot of kids born
[1:36:28] because that brother and sister got
[1:36:32] together and Daddy and the daughters got
[1:36:34] together you know what they doing
[1:36:36] they're trying to keep the lineage and
[1:36:38] they believed that it made a superior
[1:36:39] lineage but instead of that it made kids
[1:36:42] that was
[1:36:44] deformed they've proven that a lot of
[1:36:47] them were highly
[1:36:49] deformed but yet they kept doing it
[1:36:51] because they believed it was a doctrinal
[1:36:55] thing but listen when that child is born
[1:36:58] over there to that royalty it
[1:37:00] automatically becomes
[1:37:03] royalty I remember brother Brady and him
[1:37:05] telling about how that Queen and all you
[1:37:07] know when the next one is in line to go
[1:37:10] up to every what to be the queen or The
[1:37:12] King and I know this in the marriage and
[1:37:13] whatever the Kings and thing but
[1:37:15] whoever's next in line you know that
[1:37:17] they they take them when they're little
[1:37:19] they say like a daughter say Olivia
[1:37:20] there with be the next one in line to be
[1:37:23] you know to the throne you know that all
[1:37:26] of her life she's trained she didn't get
[1:37:28] to live on her own she doesn't get to go
[1:37:31] out in the rest of the world she's
[1:37:33] trained and trained and trained to walk
[1:37:36] a certain way to act a certain way to
[1:37:38] dress a certain way to talk a certain
[1:37:40] way all of her life she's
[1:37:43] trained and that Queen would come over
[1:37:48] there and stay where brother bra then
[1:37:50] was had you know what she she' do she
[1:37:52] wanted to be
[1:37:53] normal she'd sneak out at night and go
[1:37:57] downtown and the security guards was mad
[1:38:00] about it but she'd slip out and go you
[1:38:03] know what she'd tell sister
[1:38:04] Brady she' tell a servant I said don't
[1:38:07] you bathe that baby anymore in the
[1:38:09] morning I want to bathe it cuz see she
[1:38:12] didn't get to live like the rest of
[1:38:14] them she was set aside well folks why
[1:38:17] can't we believe that we are the
[1:38:19] children of almighty God set aside for a
[1:38:21] purpose in there this end time to not be
[1:38:24] like everybody else that's right that's
[1:38:26] right amen but to be the Sons and
[1:38:29] Daughters of a living God to believe
[1:38:31] what God has said about
[1:38:33] us he says we're
[1:38:40] righteous they didn't go ask the queen
[1:38:42] did you sneak around downtown that
[1:38:44] didn't make her where you wouldn't
[1:38:50] Queen God don't look at what you and I
[1:38:54] do what we do don't do don't have
[1:38:56] anything to do with it you said not just
[1:39:00] all twisted up will Heaven help
[1:39:03] you to understand the
[1:39:09] truth he is my righteousness I don't
[1:39:13] have any but let me say what he
[1:39:19] says now to end it all up how many of
[1:39:21] you treat your kids if kids good then
[1:39:24] you treat them good right now come
[1:39:32] on now Danny there you I know he does
[1:39:35] cuz he pets hope like everything anyway
[1:39:37] but but do you pet hope
[1:39:40] and and run Jacob
[1:39:44] out no no you don't do that now Jacob's
[1:39:48] a good guy that's reason I can use him
[1:39:50] he's great kid I love Jacob he's a good
[1:39:54] boy but now what if he wasn't a good boy
[1:39:57] would that make him less your
[1:40:00] child would you treat him less or
[1:40:05] different you asked June and you asked
[1:40:09] Lisa they were girls out in the world
[1:40:11] that come into this and married into our
[1:40:14] family but I never treated them any
[1:40:19] different if they come to our house with
[1:40:23] their pants on and their things they W
[1:40:25] they come into our
[1:40:27] house they knew what we believed and you
[1:40:30] know it wasn't long till they started
[1:40:32] just respecting that you know why
[1:40:34] because we didn't screaming harder at
[1:40:35] them now if we just scream hard at him
[1:40:37] get out of here go put on some clothes
[1:40:39] and act like no we
[1:40:42] didn't they Tre no
[1:40:48] different because if they're married our
[1:40:52] children they become
[1:40:55] our our
[1:41:01] Offspring because the Bible says the two
[1:41:03] become one so if you can't believe your
[1:41:05] Offspring you got a problem I treat my
[1:41:08] kids good but I just can't
[1:41:09] treat
[1:41:12] yeah you're not serving like
[1:41:15] God God treats his children the same
[1:41:19] right
[1:41:21] CU they're his
[1:41:23] children I love that story where the
[1:41:25] king come in you know and the man killed
[1:41:27] the King's son and the King come in and
[1:41:30] he
[1:41:31] said when the son when the man told him
[1:41:34] said I'm sorry in a fit of rage I just
[1:41:37] killed your son and I'm sorry I deserve
[1:41:39] what I'm getting he walked outside he
[1:41:41] said destroy all the
[1:41:46] records make him
[1:41:48] righteous go in there and shave him up
[1:41:50] and clean him up
[1:41:52] I'll be back when he came back he didn't
[1:41:55] come and say get in here I'm going to do
[1:41:56] it now he rolled out a red
[1:41:59] carpet he said you killed my
[1:42:05] son but all the records are destroyed
[1:42:09] I've told you what I believe on
[1:42:12] that you know what in the story you're
[1:42:15] not getting it if you just say all the
[1:42:17] records is destroyed about what the guy
[1:42:19] done
[1:42:22] now he said now you're my son you know
[1:42:24] what happened all the records of his son
[1:42:26] was destroyed and there stood his
[1:42:29] son you say that's impossible what's
[1:42:31] impossible with a man of God is easy to
[1:42:35] do we kill Jesus
[1:42:40] Christ and God said okay I'll just make
[1:42:43] you my
[1:42:47] son I'll make you just as righteous as I
[1:42:50] am
[1:42:53] how long was it about 6 months ago when
[1:42:55] I was trying to preach about the the
[1:42:59] uh
[1:43:00] uh like you're worshiping idols and then
[1:43:03] coming in worshiping
[1:43:06] God and to seeing that he paid the price
[1:43:09] come
[1:43:10] on come on musicians he paid the
[1:43:16] price we don't have to pay no price we
[1:43:19] just accept
[1:43:22] what he's
[1:43:23] done but then why can't we say what he
[1:43:30] says why can't we say What God Says
[1:43:33] About
[1:43:36] Us see there must be something wrong
[1:43:38] with the way we're
[1:43:40] thinking maybe we're thinking that we
[1:43:42] are saved but we're not righteous now
[1:43:46] how can that
[1:43:48] be if you're saved you're
[1:43:53] righteous what else can it
[1:43:56] be if you're saved you're healed what
[1:43:58] else can it
[1:44:03] be

[1:44:07] righteousness don't have any of our
[1:44:11] own he's our righteousness let's Stand
