[Music] to see you I want to see you how do you want to see to see you I lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we see Olie Olie Olie I enlisted shining in the light of your glory loving aura to power in love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy holy holy the way maybe holy holy holy and I want to see a man just trying around to shake hands with one another you know just looking at him so if he want to see him open your eyes man good to see everybody in the house of the Lord ready to have a brother Nathanael are with us and we was expecting brother Joe to be tonight and he he kind of got sick on us and had to be out but pray for him I talked to him this afternoon and he said that he was doing better but he still having a lot of problems and had a called it a urinary tract infection and so just remember to pray for that brother al is home he got home today from the hospital and the doctors are saying that what they'd done they gave him the medication they called it to file everything up and he would make his blood pressure go down and then he'd make it go up and the different things so he's doing better but said the doctor said well I've done all I can do you know he is getting better so you know when we get down to the end of the road and say we've done all the doctor can do we know who to turn to we turn to God and we believe it so just remember them them and just keep them in your prayers all right if you like turning your scriptures turn to jaw - now what we're going to do tonight because this is why I'm speaking I would I believe what I said Sunday is right but I want to make sure you understand what I'm talking about so I'm gonna repeat again what a preach Sunday and it'll be almost a total repeat if I read the notes but that generally don't work better way but I want to try to do it because I believe it's very needful for us to understand right where we are in this day and follow into that line so listen to the thoughts of what what we're talking about also remember now the Bible study this coming Saturday and come and be with us and the Christmas dinner remember that one on what is the fifteenth whatever sixteenth remember that and then the watch night service remember that remember there won't be any services on that thirty if I guess it is every what falls called that fall on Sunday we won't be having go with house Sunday and in with how Monday for the watch night so we won't have that service you know that day but we'll do that we've got kind of a little tickle out of something we heard that you know we changed and said we're going to have our rough from now and we're going to have our Tuesday night service before Thanksgiving instead of a Wednesday night service well I heard somebody said well you know that's a good idea we'll try it maybe it'll start a trend or do something you know at least one thing about it they're listening in because they they heard we're doing somebody's talking about it you know but that's for that only now for that that one time only in November so now we're not just changing it to Tuesday don't show up on Tuesday and say well you said it no I didn't say it I'm saying that's what we're supposed to be doing okay so keep these things in your mind and all of the announcements remember to pray as I said for brother I'll remember my wife she fell this week and hurt her back and everything so just keep her in your prayers that Lord would take care of her and help her along the way in that so let's pray before we read our scripture father we thank you for your grace and your love and we ask you now that you would just come among us and just be with us and father that we would be able to speak what you would have to be said because that's what we're dependent upon you we know that we have nothing within ourselves we depend upon you to be able to tell us what to say and give us that word forgive our sins and cleanse us and keep us Lord and remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered it from destruction so just be with each one we love you and we thank you remember the sick all among us Lord there's many things and many getting them to the aged factors and the things Lord that Satan's taking his toll upon these old human bodies but yet we know we have a Heavenly Father who is the healer deliverer he's everything and we depend upon you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen Joe 2:22 be not afraid you beast of the field for the pastures of the wilderness new spring for the tree birth her fruit in the fig tree and the vine to yield their strength be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately now I love that okay and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month alright and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and all and I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cake of worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer were my great army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed now like this and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed let's just stop Dark Lord we know the next it comes to the pouring out of the spirit so you may be seated it comes to the pouring out of the Spirit of God and do it now I want you to keep one thought in mind to not remember all the way through the Prophet said that when the people of any time that they're in he said like the days of Moses he said when they begin to cry out they get serious he said God would always come on the scene well now keep that in mind as we go through each stage again that we went through Sunday to be able to get a better understanding and follow that thought all right see then it may turn one day to see that hey are we crying out you know it may take persecution the Prophet said the bride always done er the church always done better under persecution you know if you think Oh make us cry out it's gonna put a little persecution on them get us you know get a little soft living away from us and put it down to the hard things but all right now keep that in mind as we go along that what we're talking about is the former and latter rain all right the former and latter rain according to the anointed ones at the end time fire wrath 36 the prophet said the former and the latter rain was the Spirit of God that would move among the people see it's a former rain and then it's the latter right the seed has to do with what is produced the rain just brings it forth and makes it alive alright see so the form of rain is a pouring out of God's Spirit the latter rain is a pouring out of God's Spirit it's just according to what it's being done what's taking place all right now so keep that in mind as we go along see and so we tried to illustrate down through time and we picked up there you know about just starting with John the Baptist's and as he come to introduce the Messiah he said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world that was his message he sold a former Ryan his message was that you know that he sewed the word and God quickened that word or poured out on that word and it would make it alive because dead letter is not worth anything it's the alive word the word living in each one of us alright see and John he said to judge you know he brought the message of the coming of the Messiah all right see then the massage stepped right out on what John said and there he was the latter rain to what John had brought because Jesus become the word John spoke and the Bible says then and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld as you don't know and the the Word of God the Lord Jesus was that word that was made alive a living word a dead letter is not worth anything to us it's the Living Word so remember we're trying to see that each age each time remember we're talking about sowing rain a message goes forth all right then God will quicken that and make it alive and then that will turn out to be as it progresses through it wound up being to a ladder rain or a harvest rain all right now then that'll that'll bring it forth to the time all right see in Jesus now was the alive word that John had said it so now keep that in your mind no matter when we get in the ages and we talk about a messenger bringing the message remember that somebody got to make that alive now what would have been any good if he just stood out turned and said the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world nobody appeared what good would that be all right we see it appeared right there that God came on the scene right there too before to be the latter rain are quickening are the alive word for that day all right that was you following that with me see then when Jesus he sold the message he preached the message for three and a half years that was his former reign teaching reign all right he was the alive word that brought that word unto us all right then we see that the disciples heard that word and as they did they took that word and they held onto it and when it come to the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost made that word alive and the disciples became what Jesus had spoke now don't forget that that's the point added to I keep adding these little things they don't put down notes even though it got the same notes I'm right in little charts so remember now that we're talking about the alive word not just letters you know it's the alive word that's that we're dealing with so Jesus when he sold the word he was not made alive even though it says to the disciples he opened their understanding of the scriptures and thought that was good but that's still not that didn't make it alive no they had to go to the upper room and wait in the upper room then produced the Holy Spirit to bring that word alive that was in those disciples okay and when he did see it made the alive word standing on the earth the disciples was the alive word they're not just just say well they were just people with no no they were the alive word there was no way that God could do it in any other way then the way he'd done it and by him being able to do it and we know he did then there's no way it could be any other way that's right God can't change his mind and say well I failed doing that so I'll work out some of the way no it can't be so remember then Jesus showed that word and the disciples heard it and held it and see then when it went to the Pentecost the Holy Ghost made that alive and brother Branham said because the scripture had said will he teach you things to come and brother Brown said it with it I actually went on further and told him other more more onto it other than just the point of what he had said he opened the word unto him all right they became the alive word the living word was standing on earth just as much as it was when Jesus was standing on earth the only difference was the body Jesus was in a body that was not brought forth by mankind but mankind brought that you know as he was that body he was those people but just remember whatever he makes you you are that now don't forget this next one don't forget to the next point the disciples then the disciples upon receiving the Holy Ghost and it quickening them see it didn't just put them down here at the bottom it faith it put them up here where it says Holy Spirit all right gave them what would be called the faith of the fathers all right now watch that don't lose that I don't care what you think about it listen to what say it and just consider the point those disciples begin to preach that word not just a new birth word but a stature of a perfect man adoption and the things Paul and him called alright somebody believed that and you know what became that the people believed it and became what Paul and him I mean what what Peter named had preached and it brought it out to the basis that the faith of the fathers came into view now you can think what you want to about it being eating the way we'll cover that in the ages but just remember it's supposed to be restored now the Prophet said the same Holy Ghost that justified the lutheran sanctified the Methodists baptized the Pentecostals he's now sitting in order to coming of the Lord now I didn't say these things so you're gonna have to argue with him see about it and I don't mean that in the wrong door or Tory thing I just mean it we're looking for something a lot of times to happen when it's already happening and we don't see it that's why I kept pounding on your door Sunday turn your computer on runny and former and latter rain and listen to the things brother branham boca he would call the Pentecostal people he'd say you've had a lot of rain he said you've had this teaching and even had a ladder he'd say the Baptist has had a ladder this one it's a million more than 44 he'd he'd say those but then he when he got to spoken words original seed he come up through there preaching that message that's why I've asked you to to listen to it I read it when he come up to that bringing it he had it laid out and he said two denominations who struck the world and he said the word had been sown pure and unadulterated then he said Lord there's something wrong said I've got him out on the limb now what to do because he's seen that he could that's as far as he can go he saw there was nothing else for him to do on what he was doing he had preached the faith of the Father he had preached that he had produced the statue of a perfect man in his own life I believe that he had produced the adoption to the stages and things within his life and there was no way to go and the Lord said pick up your pen and ride he picked up his pen and wrote you Nonie wrote the message and I've asked you to do it read the message then read what God's holding the rock it's identical I don't mean word for a word identical if the point is identical the point is that brother Branham had preached the faith of the fathers and was standing there believing that but he knew that wouldn't enough I know people just look at me and they when I've said it this away for 40 years I said if everybody in the world had the faith of the father's they still wouldn't be no right it'd be a wonderful world be a great place to be but that wouldn't bring the rapture because that's not that there's not enough word though that turns you back to where the disciples were we got to go on beyond that we under the Sun I'm not saying go beyond brother branham I said it right going beyond where the disciples stopped off with their message because that's what the Holy Spirit told the Prophet he says and he wrote him right and he brought it right down that plate and he said as of yet Malachi 4 is not fulfilled well he says in the front of the book Malachi forceful fail he says on on book 1 which was the morning he said now look how forceful failed let's see member the one thing that I keep quoting to you 327 church age book why does it say this messenger of Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 will do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to bring the thunders which are the revelation contained in the seven seals so what was missing if brother Branham had preached it back to the faith of the fathers what was missing in his life that he couldn't move on come on though he said I got him out on the limb Lord what can I do the Lord says that I've kept Malachi for is not fulfilled part of it had been but all of it happened see because the seals did not come forth the Prophet did not brought his message till his matches begin in the seals it's not him actually forget 247 know he's a message begun for the foundation world if you're going that away so alright but listen now watch the point and watch it come forth and follow a line up right through the ages right out to where we're at all right the disciples stopping there where we was talking about the disciples those that Paul and Peter them begin to teach the church how to come to the statute of a perfect man or to the faith of the fathers they had and remember what the scripture says were built on the foundation of próximas prophets Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone all right Jesus had laid that word down but in Matthew 24 he did not explain what are you talking about those seals were written in Matthew 24 code it ain't me in addition to the Word of God they were written to her but nobody's eyes it and had never been unveil to anyone other than him he stood there being the pure unadulterated Word all right now but when those disciples so follow you where are you going now John introduced Jesus Jesus preached the message here comes the disciples now the disciples have got a message they've got a message it's called the faith of the fathers that was their message we're built on that foundation apostles and prophets all right it was what Peter and him say it you think carnal about what I speak a lot of time but you know what where the Bible said repent everyone to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ from mission of sin you know that was one of the Apostles that said that which was Peter now you ain't going like this but you know if Peter has said repent and stand on your head you know what for anybody to get to Holy Ghost they would have had to done that because Peter was the spokesman he was the one to tell what to do so that said men and brethren what must we do he said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ why because his church is built on the revelation of Jesus Christ right don't ever forget it it never left that revelation but those disciples now when they brought that message us teaching the statue of a perfect man they brought together a people a people flew gathered up from that of where the disciples were preaching and all anybody getting it something then it brought forth the book of Acts right the axe is axe to the Holy Ghost in the church will see the church started on to their Pentecost in the book of Acts all right now and as it did did you catch what I'm talking about see thin window that church preaching the faith of the fathers you know here comes Paul going to the backside of the desert comes out of there preaches the same thing that Paul that Peter and him preached that's what your prophet said no he said there was no way country and nothing well he said Peter just wouldn't behaving himself with her when they got to the problem but he said there was no different so whatever Peter wouldn't you remember I kept emphasizing that here all but Peter preached the stature of a perfect man Paul called an adoption but it's the same identical point adoption and the statute of perfect land it's the same point or thought so out of that book of Acts now think about this and you'll see what happens down through time how do their comes out of those apostles with the faith of us out of their walk the Apostle Paul in the book of Acts right he was in the book of Acts he was that with him and trying his best to be with it with the Jews but he found out he couldn't do it so he said lo I turn to the gentle house he knew he had to move on alright and as the book of Acts the Prophet said begin to dwindle down and watch the point listen as if they begin to kind of get settled in their ways and going into doctrines and ideas and thought he said to people begin to cry out and God answered that those people with a man called the Apostle Paul with a message to the first church age Paul came as Pentecost was dwindling away now what was the church age messenger to do what's he do first he rebukes the previous age right now come on I can get these for you I've got parts of it he rebukes the previous age and said then he brings the message to his age we'll see Paul rebuked the people for getting away from Pentecost are at Pentecost as Pentecost was winding down remember the Prophet says ever messenger I'm gonna read them they'll in here ever messenger every point of them came at the end of the age choices Pentecost was dwindling down here comes the Apostle Paul you know what he was he was the answer of God to what was needed just like Moses they begin to cry out and what did God do he said Moses sure there was a lot of troubles up and down but still he was Moses and still he come back and brought the people out see then you see the ages this is the start there's the Apostle Paul bringing his message now I'd ask you to do it I'm thinking on it so if I do it forgive me I may do it I wished you'd read every church age and first pick up that thought of the rebuke and then get the part of what's going on but just remember a key in there all of that rebuke is not the bride being rebuked he's rebuking everything the bride is caught in there because she's leaving her first love is that the first church age message because diets left thy first love me to the bride it doesn't matter about the rest of them rest of them hadn't had no first love so they hadn't lost no first love who's the bride the here comes Paul walking out there and brains the Macy's remember messenger always come to into the age lorentz that always comes into the age you put Paul at the end of of Ephesus and and he'd be the messengerís to from mertha that ain't even sensible you can't put it together be sensible any of your own thinking the messenger comes to the end of the age we got the quotes Lyn here I've read them to you over and over and showing that we're right where we're standing seeing that messenger as he comes to the to the dying away of the previous age or thought or people so the Apostle Paul rebuked them the Pentecostal people or you know the book of Acts people and as he did he brought his message to the first church age all right then that would be the former rain to the first church st. Paul's message all right the people became what Paul preached then made it's been a handful wouldn't were twelve in the book of Ephesus that ain't got none to do with how many are don't worry about that well they missed a few don't worry about a few all it takes is God in one all right but around said if God can get one mile how many to say he said one or two or was it just one man in his hands one that's all he needs all right listen see read the church ages we may just take them and just read the ages and just see what the rebuke is see what happens in an age and see what is given to the people of that age cause remember one time I'm telling it the best I can say it John introduced Jesus he was the word Jesus introduces the Southwest they were the word the disciples come forth and they introduced the faith of the fathers and Paul walks out he was the word now watch my point out of the age the prior age or the age of it begins the end out of that age the bride listen the bride I don't know what's the best word to say a birth is a pretty good word ah rejects is a pretty good word but out of that first age you realize what it done that first age that those disciples had and Paul's message to them you know what it done it gave birth to Iranians it gave birth to the next church age and the messenger to come then you've got your pattern said Paul as he delivered that message then the people became the message and they were the latter rain to the former that he had brought in other words they were his message made alive the Living Word and out of that Living Word may have taken a while for it to happen I don't know how long it was between Paul and Iranians they ain't got nothing to do with it so you do that and then you're running your brain we're gonna be other what I can't be because of the essence about a thousand years in here what does that got to do with it that early church had to face of the fathers your prophet said it like stood for the first for ages I didn't say it he said it went that far the pure unadulterated word lasted the first for ages now you argue with him about it but listen then as it did what happened me that church age as the book of Acts gave birth to Paul is that okay to use it our brought out our our delivered out of them a man from what from the original word they were standing home Paul didn't walk out on something his own he stood on what the disciples said because they had to face of the fathers he was part of that so he believed what they talked and he walked out on believing it all right see then as the church age started dying down the people began to cry out for a deliverer may have been a hundred two hundred years between Paul and Iranians I don't know I didn't look at the ages of you do that but out of that cry for a deliverer walked a man a man called Iranians the messenger of the day he walked right out of what Paul did him had talked he could put everything he had back at the book of Acts little Branham tells you about Arrhenius you remember remember how he brought it you remember he really was dealing with Polycarp as being the first Church I mean the second messenger but random was actually dealing this gonna preach Polycarp and the Holy Spirit straighten him out he said Polycarp lend a little bit to organized religion he said Iranians didn't so you'd get the point what I'm saying he couldn't bring Polycarp out to be the messenger Iranian swapped out at the ending up of Paul Dage I rainiest walk out and as he did he brought a message there's you former right well you say what's his medic read to church ages come on if you want to know what is happening pause message to the first church hey why don't you read the message that the angel give to him read the first church age that's what God was dealing with read the second church age that's what God was dealing with but Iranians had stepped on the scene and he said he began to bring the word and the people watch now the people became what i reneus said the people becoming what Irena said there's a lot of rainfall in your former to quicken that and make it a living word Lai stood I don't know how long you could go back and get them out of ages in a some of them lasted 100 of years or someone longer whatever 200 it lasted a pretty good little bit see they were still under the faith of the fathers until the fourth church age now we do how the prophets word on that he said the pure unadulterated word likes it first 4:8 so hot now that don't mean everybody believes it that don't matter to me whether they wouldn't but one believed but you see when Iranians brought his message and the people begin to make that alive in the Living Word then his time went on it began to dwindle down and some of those people of Iranian serve age or time that remembered the truth begin to cry out let's get back to what Iranians talk and as they did God sent a messenger Saint Martin Martin walked right out of what Iranians was teaching he believed what Iranians talk and stood up on it because the new Iranian stood on what Paul taught and Paul stood on what Peter and all the rest of them though and Peter named note the Lord Jesus touted and John the Baptist could stand back her and say behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world you know he was right he didn't introduce something that wasn't right his message was thus sayeth the Lord right but do you get what I'm going to try the brain see then when Martin walks out upon that what the 3rd church age if I get him out in the order you just put it in this liquor I hear behind it Martin walked out desire with a pure unadulterated word till Brett around him even said it he said to Paul that Martin was the greatest let's see now I get the wording correct he said that Martin was the greatest except the Lord Jesus now there's something like that there's a the thought is dire in other words Martin standing there was the closest to the Lord Jesus that brother branham could see because that's what he was bringing out the point I'll find it for you he said there was a they was healing and ever service and things in the days of Martin he wasn't satisfied till all that was doing some of those who was which one was the one that was tied onto the tree and that was leaning up you know was supposed to killed him and and they cut the tree down that fell on the people that was tied up to the tree you got all those miracles happening but see Martin brought a message read it in the Bible the third church age he brought a message unto the angel of the churches summer or into the angel the churches started under the right you will see if I get back to it and can bring it enough you'll see that those ages exactly produced what's he saying but Martin Luther brought his message that was former right teaching right pouring the word in God was quicker than it making it alive he became alive in those disciples and they then was a latter rain why because they were the living word so your thought says no there was no rapture back there well how are they gonna get in the rat sure if there was no rapture back door would you explain that because I've told you from day one the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the closest thing there is to a change of the body and a rapture if you don't have the baptism of the Holy go you ain't going to be in the rapture the rapture starting today you've got the new birth so when each one of them got the new birth that put inside of them what would take them come on so Martin Luther or Martin excuse me Martin brought his message and as he did the people became the message now watch what I'm saying to prove they became the message Columba walked right out of Martin's message from the people executive Jackie you got a hundred or two hundred years from Martin to Columbo so they were still a bunch of people that believe the Word of God and Columbo walked right out of their error how you put a combo come some different ways to pronounce out of there Walt the messenger of what to force her change and as he did he had a message to Brian which was the former Ryan the teaching rang he taught his message and the people become what he taught and if they become what he told they become the alive word the alive word and as they did when we get to the ages and it take though the ages and see what they produced what you see that didn't end it all because it had to be more to come remember what I taught from the beginning on three or four eight messages ago if you can never find a former rang don't you worry about it they've got to be a letter I they no such thing is coming to former raining and ain't no ladder I know I see it the devil's even got that the devil has his teaching right and he has his ladder right so don't thank this because you said well now they stopped no I didn't stop nowhere cuz here's where you're gonna lose out because Martin then Columba Columbus I stood it was right in a thousand years between Columbia and I'm not exactly to the point where between Columbia and Martin Luther was right onto a thousand years of the dark ages the old cankerworm pom worm locust and the caterpillar had eat the church down to a stump but remember it couldn't eat away the stump because jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell cannot prevail against it all right so there was no way that it could be a totally down and here comes a little old man of Martin Luther that we don't think much about but Martin Luther must have been a Christian or something you know he was a preacher and you know he was in the monastery he was in all osa he must have been a Christian of some form I don't think they would have let him be up there preaching if he had to claim some new birth well I only had with justification you just remember one thing and don't you ever forget it Martin Luther's justification did put him in the body of Christ now if you want to leave him out you go ahead and do what you want to that's between you and God but Martin Luther was in the body of Christ it's like anybody else because it was the Holy Ghost in every age what did Martin Luther have the Holy Ghost but run said maybe not in the measure of this age but they had it but out of there come Martin Luther and why did it come out for because the people begin to cry out for a deliverer and God answered that cry with a man called Martin Luther there was a Catholic in the monasteries and doing all those things and get a desire and his heart began to raise up don't you think he studied the Word of God you know by the time that Martin Luther had come on the scene they had by then the writings of all of the Apostles brought into view because you're coming on to what thirteen fourteen fifteen hundred and you already had books you already had the the Wycliffe and the different ones that come forth and who edit the German that there was a lot of them that Haller already even by the time Luther come along you already had Bibles somewhere right in that period of time you picking up the Bible well Martin Luther was studying the Bible you know what he found he had probably read the book of Romans a thousand times he'd probably make commentaries on the book of Romans he'd probably spoke all over the land of the book of Romans the one day he looked down and he said the just shall live by faith and they said he wrote but I got it on my Bible said he wrote the just shall live by faith alone because it was revealed to it what his message was revealed what was Martin Luther's message the just shall live by faith does it form of rain sure they had a lot of problems in it but out of that came a group of people that believed it put the Bible and all into the hands of man coming on over to the time of getting everything set to work that the Bible could be brought to the to the common people to where they could read it what a wonderful age it was of the age of Martin Luther we get you here people in this message say there didn't help nothing whets with him did how none seen even Pentecost was false but you know people swear but those people's word go ahead but you see Martin Luther as I emphasized he was already a credited Christian and out of there came the just shall live by faith he brought that message in the people became that message and they became that message they became the latter rain to the former right in other words they became the alive word oh I don't believe in feedback that was a live word well what are you they don't play with me with quotes I'm too old I'm sorry I know I'm hateful arrogant and everything the world but I can't help being what I am I can read and believe it brother branham referring to the Zeus retreat penticoff he said one day on the Nexen he said they were closer to the coming of the Lord than we are oh you don't want to hear that what'd you see he was telling it like it is Martin Luther and then they begin to get to word into man's hands and think you know to translate it to bring it down and we finally got the King James Version but you see that lie stood for a hundred years or so and the people begin to cry because they seen the people getting away from Luther's message you know in the beginning of Luther's message you know they really believed his message so much you know what they'd done that's wait about it he he brought it out here while by you know what those Lutheran's done I mean just a little what I have - Luther brought his message on you want you to they burnt down the churches inside because they believe that's what Luther was saying Luther says no I've read his own writing where he said I did not want to leave the Catholic Church I wanted to reform it it's kind of funny Nene writes a thesis to do away with some of the doctrines they had and still cures the Catholic cross in baptizes in Father Son and Holy Ghost and the Holy Mary and all of these things that's where people can't follow that and believe me that was a man of God well what are you you better remember where you came from that's one thing I've always said I know where I came from and I know the doctrine I came from but a lot of you said well I didn't know what that doctrine was that dire no because you don't know what the doctrine is now you don't know the truth you won't listen to it you won't follow it like I said the other day I asked you reach forward and regional scene Sunday I said raise your hand probably 10 people in the building raise your hand I ain't raising my hand cuz I ain't no big show-off now your brother now you can call it anything else see I just asked you to where you can tell to see that that at least like one brother said there's one thing about brother tail I got a note in this recently from brother he said that's one thing about it he said they can't nobody argue about what you saying they've caused you reading it I said well thank God for that at least I'm reading it it ain't up to me to quicken it anyway but listen Church you realize what I'm talking about where did whit Wesley come from come on 100-200 years between Lutheran with where do Wesley come from you know what Wesley was he was a Lutheran you said whoa what do you mean I mean he was convert under the Lutheran ideas and couldn't concept what caught what was he under Wesley wasn't under that already a preacher in England that half of his family was preachers he goes to America to preach to the Indians on the way he meets the Moravians River how you pronounce it and they teach him the doctrine of sanctification because as the ship was sinking and doing bumping in the water they were out there saying in like everything you know wasn't scared of nothing he seen they had something and he said I came to America convert the Indian he said lo I found out I needed to be converted and what happened Wesley stepped out with sanctification ii work sanctification which is part of the word of god whether you like it or not what you see Wesley then brought a message of sanctification swept the world with the doctrine of sanctification most all of your songs if you're looking at them and listen to your words or your songs that you were singing I know it was the blood I know it was the blood both of them was written during been Wesley's period and you know what they were believing that you were saved by the blood that's what brother I've said now I didn't say it he said they believed they were saved by the blood he said you're not saved by the blood he said now if you're gonna do anything he was kept safe by and said you would incite by and he said you're saved by grace through faith would you see what I'm talking about Luther actually expelled or pushed out from him and his message walk out of that message a man that was believed in Luther's message walked out and became a messenger to the 6-2 change and he began to preach sanctification and the people began to come to that he was teaching sanctification better than what you think he was now I've got his rotten at the house of you and read it he said that his message of sanctification was that sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's new that's Wesley's words that the message of sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know ha that's right it was for the time but you see then it goes on Gretton realize now it goes on the people of that day become what Wesley taught and for hundreds of years that held on brother Brown said there was a little strand all the way down through there the worth of true believers stayed with the word a little straight line with it they stayed with that word they believed what Martin Luther taught they believed what John Wesley taught and what he brought around the state then the one-eyed black man he said in a couple of hobos I've got him laying here run sit in a couple of hobos he said the people begin to cry out said they felt along and they began to cry out for deliverance and said God come on the scene and delivered that message to them and brought to them the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the message of the gifts but you say that to most of people that's message they'll run you out of the church if you say the Zeus of street Pentecostal people had to baptism in the Holy Ghost brother Branham said to head to baptism when hole goes just like the book of Acts now you argue with him no you're not going to argue with him you just ain't gonna believe it well I just can't see that I didn't ask you to see it I asked you to thank God for truth because where would we be today had it not been for Luther Wesley and Pentecost you realize you would have had a vast gap in between now with nothing is that what you're teaching yeah but brother saw it so came free share and he said that right he did right here in this church and I told him it was wrong but I ain't gonna back up and I want to argue with nobody but I ain't gonna back up when it comes to the word cuz I've told you about it we've set in one day and a couple of brothers and we're talking about we're brother Brown said that says the church had received the baptism in the Holy Ghost just like the day of Pentecost one of them said well we ain't got it yet and the other one said I don't had that all along I said would you two mind if I just stay in the middle cuz I can't go need one either one of you and that's when I tried my best to explain it that on the day of Pentecost you had a hundred and twenty in the upper room that when they received the new birth it was right here at Holy Spirit but the 3,000 later and everybody from then on got the new birthday faith a baby in Christ I've talked to at 40 years and I mean backing all for nothing you say you were you're gonna run us off listen Church I cry and pray for you every day if you're gonna get up and walk out just remember you're walking out over my tears and I pray for God to help you to open to see the word my family and everything that's all I've ever tried to do is preach the Word of God I know you don't like my ways and ideas that's all right I don't like yours but what's that got to do with it come on Church but see from that little group of Martin Luther that held on to the word for a hundred or two hundred years they begin to cry out and God brought a man named John Wesley Wesley brought his message of sanctification for Moraine teaching rain the people became what Martin loop of what John Wesley taught and as they did they became the latter rain to what he was teaching which was the alive word are a harvest you realize they've got it to demanded it the people that walked out our own Wesley's message if God had demanded right then to end it all on counter you know there wouldn't been nobody else but he took to him because they did have the new birth they had to baptism with the Holy Ghost and out of that becomes that one eyed black man that brother Branham said he was the messenger to the aged he said I would not to mention her to lady you'll see it he said because I you can't be but around him wasn't the messenger the lady will seal you so who was that around tells you who was he said to one eyed black man brought the message and he said God answered the plea of the people and gave them the restoration of the gifts and he said and brought to them the baptism of the Holy Ghost do you believe that do you really believe that that he brought to them that if you can pick it up with me we'll pick up the number five we run around on Feast of the trumpets said now if I come with a message of Pentecost I would be in the lady you see in church age and I wouldn't and it wouldn't be right but around was not to messenger the lady of Steel oh we got the drawings we've had this drawings brother branham done this drawing showed it everybody it's got to fit in there because remember he had two things he had to turn the hearts of the children back and then he has to bring the sails he's got two things yeah look at the next one gods only provide a place of worship he said in Pentecostals that brother when I believe one with the eyes was out a colored brother who really started the Pentecostal message in California old Azusa Street he was like that because he was a Negro he was made fun of but he brought a message for that age witnesses number seven 350 years ago a one-eyed colored man humble in his heart with no education along with a group of faithful Saints waited younger on the zoo Street until the power of God fell from heaven has a witness that God in the last days had poured out his Holy Spirit upon the Western world it caused a great revival you know yourself if you've ever studied the message for the Brennan Center Azusa Street with the lice great moving revival of that way you said yeah but you talk about having a revival individuals individuals have a revival in this day the next one will we need two witnesses to Israel come on but listen I love this because I've always quote this one but listen I've always quote this now but I don't never finish it that's pretty good of me anyway go to number ten I was looking at issue then I thought hey I'd better read what this more of it so go to number ten this is one a lot of you don't like me to read that's alright I love to read it already 50 years sorry screaming now this messenger of Malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 so now he's gonna do two things don't turn the hearts back in the sevens gonna bring the seals right is that right now it's going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the father's 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelation contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so now what this prophet messenger will be him but he says but consider this also know what see this prophet messenger will be in his nature in manners as were Elijah and John the people of this prophet messengers of day will be as they were in a halfs day and in John's and since it is only the children whose hearts will be turned it is only the children who will listen I like that order been reading that the whole time ok next time I quote it was remember is that what do you see what I'm talking about Azusa Street you know the bread around them said it do you won't keep reading Azusa Street I'm going to read around and said no messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself it's in this seal first sealed I know that you know let's see if I can find it I got it here hold on okay it's really number two which is questions and answers on the sea you see each one of those ages only taking the dip into the Holy Spirit justification is working the Holy Spirit sanctification is work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the Holy Spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the age no man no messenger he didn't say the Holy Ghost didn't come on because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism Zeus's treat somebody tells you they didn't how the Holy Ghost back there you tell them they're lying because brother around and said you did that once because the Holy Ghost came in self in the fullness of the Baptist but at the end of the age and it always ends upon the others we find in dar the messenger sin and all these scruples and things are to be placed in their places like that then the rapture comes to the church no messenger to the lady will see an age because the Holy Ghost came himself holy ghost was a messenger to ever church age you don't make no difference now where's Powell Iranians John I mean what he was a messenger to all of them it is the Holy Ghost in every age or what you see brother branham comes along see out of that little group he said they immediately call showing that it would be a quick quick short work our age he said immediately they started drawing up their doctrines increased he said even before the second generation you know I need to always talk first generation stays pretty good second generation goes to what he says in one quote he said the fact that they they didn't wait till the second generation he said started writing their own creeds and I and then you see brother Branham coming out know who's brother branham rebuking brother Brown was rebuking the Pentecost was for getting away from the message right he rebuked the Baptist he rebuked everybody you see Church we won't listen to him you know that brother branham said one day like this he's talking about the Baptist he said you better leave him alone he's because they know the word but see they didn't have the spirit to go with it right so they just went with their own letter of the word but they had to word remember that's where he came from whether you like it or not he came out of the Baptist Church oh that's contrary to this quote over here to where it says no prophet ever come out of a church age he didn't come out of the church age you want me to prove it to you I'll find it for you about 19 and 58 or 59 brother Brennan said the Baptist just now become a denomination you don't that quote the Baptist's just now become a denominator there's a denominator over a hundred years for the N right as far as what we think what's he talking about you realized that when that prophet stepped on the scene nobody could stand before him and he rebuked the Pentecostals and everything prior to them and so you know when they become a denomination it's when they turned down what he talked the Baptist's become a denomination in like 58 59 so cuz they turn down what he talked because you can't stand before a prophet nobody can no matter what it is nobody extend before profit profit don't stand for nobody either he stands before God all right so get the point of what we're talking about Rhoda Branham then as he steps on the scene forty's Fifty's and all like that he's preaching the faith of the fathers trying to get the church to turn back to that because that's his former right that's his former right was teaching back to the faith of the fathers who would be the latter ain't anybody that would take that and believe it and would be the alive word I hope you get what I said a moment ago it seemed to went flat but you see there is nobody that was in bad shape until brother Branham brought the message of the truth because everybody had their own points and their own ideas and God was winking at ignorance but one day he brought a little profit on the scene and he quit winking and he said now you've denominated and you're dead but you see there was a little group of people that heard the profit and down through time they stuck with it think about yourself as being some of them some of your older one especially on the internet was that that you listen to that prophet you believed it sure you had problems and troubles because nobody ever talked like him but yet you believed it and you know out of our was produced a ladder rain that a prophet wouldn't just be so indifferent for the faith of the fathers that his message would come forth you say what brother his message yeah his message not in the years and preparation but when he begins to sound the message these mysteries will be revealed and then they are not know knowing then and the people are a witness of that that's from the message trying to do God a service without his will all right what about it when did the prophets message begin well I thought its message begins back on part one turn the hearts of the children back to the father's the Holy Ghost picking up the black man and the people and bringing it and the Prophet stepping right out of that where did he come from works his faith Express 1965 pointing to this our revelation 10 said that in the hour of the seventh angels message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the heathen healing service I have heard but now I see and he promised in the hour of the seventh angels message the seven seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared revelation 2:10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service the rapture 1965 and I must say it and my message all the time knowing back dar under healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is and then the seven seals opened those mysteries and showed those things what about it see now he sold his message along with the last of 62 I say that because of spoken word reading on C because that was when he began to really direct and not right either a few days four prior to that back you go back to is it the serves what time is it in other word is it an hour a day all right and he starts bringing his message what is his message from the seals and only unto eternal life because this messenger would have to stand between man and attorney because they not another messenger to come he didn't come to introduce another messenger he become he come to introduce as I quoted at Sunday rotor Braun said this man this one would be standing pointing to the skies that a word born bride who's reporting to you and I come on questions and answers 1954 Oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all the new ologies failed to do in two thousand years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that fate for the little remnant after the doors of the Gentiles is closed Oh God will annoy the church then he whose filthy let him be filthy he whose righteous let him be righteous he's who holy let him be holy God will anoint the church with the power of God and things will be taking place not only that then but he's doing it now he's doing it now 54 why because there was people back I believe in the world you know there was people back there that was the alive word you want to tell me those old Azusa Street wasn't alive word when they throwed Rotten Tomatoes at him they killed him they beat him they done everything in the book with him to try to stop him from preaching and they couldn't stop when you tell me that ain't a living word but listen watch the trouble I tried to remember it whenever could get it right so go ahead and pull up number it'll make a life point look number 17 which is we're going to the scriptures I gave you and look what it says you want to know what's wrong you want to know why we're here 50 years after the profits gone right here is the answer right in the Word of God read it lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou hath not been laying with in the ways has now set for them as the Arabian in the wilderness and thou has polluted a land with thy whoredoms and with our wickedness look there for the showers have been with holden and there have been no latter rain and thou hast a horse forehead that refuses to be ashamed now if that ain't hitting this age I'll pick it up Sunday the Lord willing rot from the dark if that ain't it you tell me what it is you said well you throw it out to everybody taught it to me and you what everybody else does is their business I'm preaching here I don't preach out there what's out there if they hear it that's fine that's the work that's their problem they're the ones gonna have to be put up with I'm trying to preach it here but we ain't had no letter n brother Dale you know why cause you got a horse forehead oh don't talk like that to me I'll have you know will I have you to know I ain't backing up the Bible just said it the Bible just told you why we had to write it right cause you got a horse forehead what does that mean a denominational horse forehead in other words our own ideas and our thoughts enough things about the Word of God that is not God's Word because remember the profit has brought his message he brought a former rain listen that started with the seals in the time and brought his message now if it's true what I preached all the way down then there's got to be somebody to stand on that and become what he taught or I've been wrong all the way back from John and Jesus now you want to say that about me go ahead drop what you see if you say that was right down through there then you got to say it's right in the end there's got to be a group of people a prophet said under their messenger that would be the final voice to the final age former and latter right harvest rain the prophet called it or he called it rapture where we had former and latter former and letter then I ended up trying my best to explain why it said the two former and latter is to be therein jaw in the same month it's to be a short word quick because that's what it says in the original when it said it be a short work look it up it says there'll be a short word in the original translation why because he's gonna cut it short in righteousness is that the scriptures he's gonna bring it forth his righteousness to you and I and we're gonna have to walk in it I see our days of playing and pitter-patter around and everything else we'd better get rid of it because we're in the last days see what you get and I listen to former and latter rain just a second look with what you get today from God it doesn't matter what he's revealing what he's revealed one God to you maybe it's right now might reveal one guard to somebody sitting here you know what that is former right but when you take that within your heart and it becomes truly alive to you and you see that it's real there's you later on but now you know yourself I try to explain it you see something in the Word of God right now come on listen you see something in the Word of God and it's so beautiful I mean it's so simple and you walk outside and you say brother I want to tell you what was revealed I've done about forgot what was revealed now is that true you go to try to explain it you know why you know why it's that away anytime you speak it I'm a minister been a pastor all of these years I know this is true any time you speak the Word of God by your word itself it's going to blind a lot of people I've known that ever since it started that literally by me trying to explain it is going to blind it well really look like you just quit I can't I've cried I've prayed I'd love to quit there's something down in my heart won't let me quit I'll die in this pull up here to do something but it ain't gonna let me quit why because I ain't gonna quit I want to quit I'd like to sit down and this get the burden off of my heart now I can't do it you don't I go hunting I've said a minute ago my gun against a tree and me setting there praying about you asking hard to help you see it would you do me a favor and pray that much for me you know would you do that much why because we need it what you see whatever you get today tomorrow you're gonna have to have another word now you won't proof of that you get something today tomorrow's reveal you're gonna you won't have to have something to follow that now you want me to prove it why do you burn the bread when you take the communion why do you burn the bread a lot of you probably don't even know you do what the Bible tells you to burn that bread before the next day why because we can't hold over anything you said what that's the Word of God that's right but there's more to come what you got today is just a former tomorrow's a lighter but when it does that former becomes lighter you say you you're out of the message you get with me someday and let's talk I love to talk about the Word of God and looking the things we read around him say it he'll say here comes the form of rain with the latter rain on it that's easy to understand former rain latter rain that's easy to understand but how about this one here comes the latter rain with the former on it Oh now you've got another thought because you've got former ladder works okay but latter form are gonna work but it does if you listen what you receive today tomorrow's ladder when that day comes it becomes former you start over trying to explain what you see you know yourself you tried to explain things to people and you've seen it so beautiful and you start trying to explain it and you just stand there like lord I don't even know what I'm talking about I thought I had something in this one other I need to go back and read a little if you ain't never done that you ain't never had a good witness yet but you know and just keep home cause you know watch somebody somebody's going to believe it then you know what now here's what I hadn't the point ahead and put the other so I'm putting it this message sorry just hold on because what we've got maybe for me it may be just teaching right but it means it's going to be a letter I'm there's going to be a harvest because it's a harvest of the denomination's the harvest of everything there's harvesting the bride there's going to be a harvest so hold on just hold on until we can get rid of that horse forehead how do you get rid of a horse forehead by taking the truth and let it clean those cobwebs out a horse forehead is a contrary doctrine to the truth all right he just hold on he ain't gonna leave us he started to work the Bible said and he'll finish it that's why it doesn't bother me that's why it doesn't bother me to stand here I sure as a human being hey fifty years ago I was young man I mean there wasn't no such thing as today's work when I was 25 27 years of age they wouldn't no such thing as today's work I was about 35 I guess I thought what was it and wading in was building the house and I worked at General Motors left the house at 4 o'clock in the morning to get tired and go to work at 6 get off at 2:30 drive to Gainesville and work from 2:30 on wages in their house where they were building on the the nursery thing or what you called it there for the kids and work from then until 9:30 leave at 9:30 go home take a bath getting a bed near the next morning I preached three services a week didn't have nobody to preach with me and I was working that way every day Saturday we was up there daylight going to work and we worked too dark and I had to preach to services the next day I didn't have no such thing as a weakness there was no such thing if brother al could be here he Dame in it we were down in the woods one day we wish to build stands you know we we'd really build him up in trees and we've done in the woods one day in our life I come down through there and neighbors are two of them working on one stand in our life they couldn't get nothing started I said get out of the way I built the stand crawled up in it and finished it up you said well you ain't know him you know I'll write back before then the reason I told him to go and start working I walked into the to some honeysuckles and I had cramps and both legs and I could not look I had to tell him to go ahead and I stood there and work them cramps out until I got any went done ER and built that stand I think the hell no such thing as an energy run out worked all day preach all night that's what I told one brother went down call musician I told one brother he said something he said I've spoke knock twice this week and said I've traveled about 500 miles and said I've done this that and the other than working I said you know what you need he said what I said you need a job if you've got too much time on your hands you need a job he said what do you mean I said I preached three services this week I've traveled 140 miles every day to working back and if I'm building houses did you see those days is over that away but it ain't gonna take nothing out of my body my stamina my being of what I am that I'll preach until the last day I draw a breath because I want you to see the truth I want you to see the truth they don't matter to me I could be a multi-millionaire right now that's no joke I can prove it now give it all over here to try to help you or to help somebody else cuz it ain't gonna be no good try to take it we you'd be trying to say what was that floor said this ain't nothing but payment comes payments of gold he said you trying to bring gold in I'm hearin ain't nothing but walking pavement down there you know let's stand together I hope you understand what I'm going about former and latter rain so you say what do you expect him brother Dale wrote around and said when the door the Gentile church is closed God willing on a church all right thank God for his word he promised it and he'll bring it whether I live to see it ain't got nothing to do with it but I'm looking for it every day I like what Billy Graham said one time he said I look for him today if he don't come here I'm looking tomorrow I look for him to come all the time but I know what he said who had to do we had to become the word now you don't become the word stand on Facebook's and and all of these things you know all of that the Internet's and the things we got to have those things to operate but there's no rapture in faith on Facebook and it don't work faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word just keep reading just keep praying somewhere God's gonna make it manifest why cause he promised it go ahead brother well we got before before he starts let me say this brother Lewis and M are going to or nicaraguan somewheres else and then the
