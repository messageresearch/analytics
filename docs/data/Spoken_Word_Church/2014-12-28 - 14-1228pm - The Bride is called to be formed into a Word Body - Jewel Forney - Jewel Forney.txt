trust the Lord I'm going to try to parachute out but we just thank God this uh this evening I'm going to go right to the word of the Lord this evening in the book of Galatians the 4th chapter and verse 19 and also Colossians the 1 chapter and verse 27 but this is one those statement I'm going to use right here Paul just says my little my little childrens of whom I whom I Prevail in birth again until Christ be what in you uh Galatians I mean Galatians 1:27 he said to to whom God will make known what is the richest of the glory of this this mystery among the gentille which is Christ in you the hope of glory let's pray hallelujah oh Father help me one more time to yield my body my mind my spirit my soul to you oh God oh God help me to get myself out of the way Lord and use it for your glory this evening father now father I give you all my strength in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated one moment you nothing else do with the this this them scriptures Al long or to them scriptures alone have got enough uh anointing and enough Revelation to almost uh to interpretate it what God purpose is for the bride Hallelujah in other words I I I I want to use for a title this evening for a start the bride is called to be formed into a word body hallu that's that's the you know we preach the revelation of the Seven Seals and and the revelation of the Thunders and and the revelation of of of the chain you know the NS and everything but really when we look at the all the whole picture of it that God had a purpose for this Revelation and what you know you know a lot of time we take Revelation well I got an understanding we realize Revelation is a Divine understanding not just a understanding because many can understand all the the Mysteries and them and not even be born again but real Revelation is got a purpose with it Hallelujah in other words so Paul say I lay him prevail that mean I'm experiencing pain a birth pain for you until Christ be formed in you and so Paul knew that we was coming to an edge that Christ was going to be manifested in his fullness and a body called The Church of the Bride H we begin to look here so we realize here so you know we we we we are just looking at these things here a word body is what we try to get back to because if you think about it what is our purpose for for even coming to hear the message message we're not just coming to hear the message just to say well I'm a good person I've been good I done this but we are coming to hear the message and hear the word of God because we are trying to get our body back to where it fell from hallelujah our body hey people now if you if you satisfi with this body you God that's up to you but I'm tell I tell you what this thing right here getting no trouble me and the older it get the worse it get Hall you know it it's nothing fun about getting right how that way you know you know we try to we try to in world so we realize here we realize here so God had a purpose and God purpose is that God that that man that God can dwell in man and a flesh body and we have eternal life absolutely you know when we find it I was just using this I said you know if we look at the revelation of it God in in genes 127 said God created man in his own image so when God put man in the IM image of in his invisible image of Adam in other words in this image that Adam was first created in when God created it could not be a fall in that that body to Adam first that body right there the devil couldn't come to that body in tempure right Hallelujah if Adam would have stayed in that body Hallelujah it would never been a fall so then the Bible says here in in Genesis 2 verse S then God formed man Hallelujah word he took he took from the the the attribute of the Earth how the Propet the Earth was an eternal attribute and he and word if Adam would have never fell he would he if he would have never fell in that body he would have been a Eternal attribute living his skin so God aded here so God took the Earth and he formed man and Man became a living Soul you notice this it was a living soul right in other words in other words Adam had God to breathe in him a eternal spirit Adam himself had eternal life H the Adam himself did not have uh Adam himself did not have blood right you said brother you said why he didn't have blood because what did he need blood for hu he was an eternal spirit but when Adam fell and man fell and then what did man do he begin to he death set in and when death s in into the body of man man as he ate the food of the earth that was in the curse man had blood H and the only thing that's polluted in US is our blood scream on H the Bible say there's no flesh and blood will in Hur the kingdom of heaven so what did Jesus do and when Jesus died on the day of redemption he it was a blood sacrifice and it had to be blood because man fell and he need something to cover his sin so it had to be blood H the blood screen in other words so we realize here now we would have read up doing that because I want you to no Adam that body that he had after Adam fell no longer can Adam pass through a tree before Adam fell he can walk right through the object H another and still have have a body with flesh on it h where that body had no limitations on it I B got limitations on it how in other words so this whole me the whole revelation of this word is to bring us back to that same body that Adam had the Bible say about one man sin we all fell until this corruption right here but by Man by one man righteousness we would all be restored back to what we fell from the whole message itself is bringing us back to restored Eden H so I begin to look here let me look at this simp a minute I begin to think on these things and I begin to think why you know you say brother Jew like brother like like brother way used today it was really I really enjoy the way he brought it up if without faith without a divine revelation there's nobody change for you that's right because the Rapture is based on a revelation right of Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory hu outside of that the body don't change you do not change CH the body by being a good person you changed by Revelation and if you notice here I was going to use this quote the scripture when he talk to Peter he say to Peter he asked him who the man said that I am and they begin to say well some said uhh you are Elijah some say you are one of the Prophet Jesus say it's not good enough it's not in of the word is what some man say it was somebody else had an opinion of me but who do you say that I am H it was by Revelation Peter said th the Christ the son of the Living God that Revelation alone was strong enough come on to get Peter the keys to his own house Hallelujah he gave Peter the keys to his own house by divine revelation Hallelujah he said Peter he said the Gates of Hell will come against you but the Gates of Hell shall not under any circumstance be able to overcome this Revelation right here H we got a revelation of got the devil answer I begin to look here so we begin to think on them things I begin to think so he telling Peter this and this the Revelation alone is what going to change our bodies we going to have a body change because in the word everything you know if you notice he used that pyramid this morning it start with faith and I realize outside of having faith those virtues could never be scre no way H so it take Faith to believe it right H and then and what is it doing what is the statute of the perfect man is Christ been formed in you the hope of glory that's the whole Revelation H the statute of a perfect man and when Christ himself is standing behind skin again H that's the revelation God trying to get us back to Hallelujah praise God I just we just stinking on everything thing so and when man Fa l get back here he word see brother he he us we we would we to have we to have eternal life Adam had eternal life he had eternal life until Adam walked down behind the word of God and when Adam walked out behind the word of God he walked into time if you notice this when Adam fell what did he do he moved from eternity into time Hallelujah in other words he stepped out of he walked from eternity and walked into time because the Bible say in the day that you eat the that day you should surely die Adam was not associated with days come on he he was just Eternal Soul he had eternal life but when when Adam when Adam walked out from behind the word of God what did he have he fell into death he fell in time H now Adam going to eat the bread he got to wait until he returned back to dust where he come from from Adam from out of dust will th taken and dust shall I return so what did he do in other word it put him in a a lock of time until means a due time or decree season so Adam had a time that he was going to die because the day he entered her that day when no man live a thousand years on earth right Adam fored his right to actually go back at that time to have eternal life in the body and live he did not even live one day because the day with the Lord was a th years and the as of that year he did not make it a day methus Liv 969 years he did not make it a day but this bride she's going back she's picking up the old seven she go back into millania we live a thousand years on Earth how the fulfilling because God word cannot be broken how begin to look here so we realize here what it is so we what is the whole Revelation the seven SE the seven SE is coming is the the Seven Seals coming to the bride is to give us a revelation right right of the changing of the body amen so it can take us out of time and put us back in eternity that why he say the seven seal which is Christ himself coming back to what earth right the Revelation was thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven hallelujah how will we know what this will is and remember when Jesus said don't Rejoice because the devil's accepted unto you but Rejoice because your name is WR in heaven H those guys could not interpret it they might have said one they probably wonder but that's a time that the Revelation is here now that the bride know where she come from H it's the to bring her from time back into eternity we are going back to where we come from hallu the devil know he can't defeat the bride so we begin to go here look here read a quotation from what the prophet said in the mess of invisible Union in other words he goes to use this right here I want you to notice this God do not destroy himself he said if God destroy himself how can he remain God the soul that SED that Soul should surely die he said God destroyed himself how can he remain God H but if you was with God the devil can't and word now let me just use this right here let just show you how BR put it in in Mage invisible you he said you are the purpose you are the pure virtue sinless Bride of the son of of the Living God every man and woman that's born born not just coming into it saying I'm in the message but saying I am born I am born I have come through the states of justification sanctification and I have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost I am born of the spirit of born of the SP spirit of God and wash in the blood of Jesus Christ and believe every word so now he telling us he telling us praise God that's all right I like that guy right there he up on his game he see eyes h words now I can see that and now he said wash in the blood of Jesus Christ and believe whatever word how can you claim I'm part of God and deny the word right how you ever that you of God se you can accept every word of God that's the CH that's the revelation of your body change you got to have every word your body is built by word upon word until you go back into a change H so it goes in here says he said believe every word of God believe every word of God in stand as though you never sin in the first place and he said now you you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ how how can you any man then he goes on and say the name parag right it says here and he said I was supposed to die in the morning and somebody took my place so now you go back here like I like what you know he was using this morning a lot of people say when Adam like he said that is incorrect teaching when Adam placed his seed in Eve howu he redeem how could Adam redeem he and he needed Redemption himself Hall Adam needed to be covered by the blood himself H like said when he put his seed in that was his that was his lawn that was his seed H that was his generation that God would rais up but they had to come through the blood without to shed in the blood there no remission of sin Adam had to come through the blood k a all them a had to come through the blood now can't never receive the blood all he had to do do what did do what his brother done except the blood how but he refused the blood for reasoning I can make it on my own good works and know what the people say today they trying to make it in I I've been raised in the meage I'm a good person I never done this God ain't looking for that God looking for somebody that been born and washed in the blood of the Lamb have they been Loos from your sin by the washing of the word that's right Hallelujah man I don't know where all that come from I bet I keep this shirt on I better get this shirt where I go Hallelujah and he said he said I was a man somebody take my place I did not die for that sin right right I did not die for that sin right I should have right you should have died for your sins right Hallelujah but we had a big brother yeah how we had somebody to take our place it Ain that we didn't have to sin but we had somebody that was worthy enough to take our place right that's right he says here he said did he said I did not doubt but I did not die for that sin everybody everybody somebody took my place then he says here Jesus the word took my place he became me yep that a sinner y that I might become him the one Hallelujah so you see what he's doing he's restoring us back right to what we had fell from we fell from the word and the only way to get back we needed a lamb we needed somebody to take our place as a cner CU it was required for somebody to die amen hallelujah says here and he and he he became me that s that I might become in the word then he says right here amen he the let let let me hold true to the to it right not the church right because the church don't carry the hoglin it don't carry the spirit to gen to change your body you say I believe the church but the pr say I believe the word and will not say because you go to this church you not say because you go to my church you are saved because you accept Christ in the word hallelujah amen then he go through and says oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now he said when the flesh is becoming what word did I say we going back to word dad he not concerned about he concerned about getting back to the word hallelujah other way you going to try to make it on good good works in your own flesh you'll never do it but Revelation that's in you is changing you for a Rapture the only way you can be changed for a Rapture your flesh got to become we again Hallelujah he said flesh is becoming word and word and word is becoming flesh the manifestation Vindicated what what was creation looking for a manifestation of the sons of God a Vindication of the sons of God and only way we can be really be a Vindication of the sons of God we need to go back to what we come from all creation within Prevail and waiting for the word to be made flesh and flesh to be made word he says here he said the Vindication what he said what the Bible said what happened in in this day it happened day by day what y day by day and it is what now say c word coming uh so fast there is those uh Des and things taking place cannot even keep up with it he said we're nearing the coming of the what Jesus Jesus the unity will Unite with the church while the word become what the word call the Holy Spirit searching the heart the word is becoming flesh and flesh is becoming word the reason you are DED out it's not because you trying to be good it's because the more you eat the B right it materializing CH in you Hallelujah that's right I you said brother see this is the whole revelation of it done made it looks so mysterious like it has not got nothing to do with you but the seven seal revealed the Antichrist Spirit show you the devil was that Define the power of Satan that Satan have no power over you because we know who he is right only re he had power on us before we knew who he was we didn't understand how religious he was but when the SE was open it shows Satan a religious spirit riding a white horse look like he was the Holy Ghost in the first age but when the word was open what did it do it showed that was not the Holy Ghost right because he had a ball and no arrows Hallelujah it was an impersonator only the Holy Ghost can give us the revelation that God will not accept that kind of spirit Hallelujah that what this whole message been about Hallelujah other words he just didn't give us the seven Thunders is not just seven Thunder was the mystery that was entain in the seven seal but actually the seven Thunder is a little voice right exactly Hallelujah yo once Christ comes in you and you become the very revelation of the word your voice become God voice on H your thought become God thoughts right that what God trying to get us back to so the bride can speak death said the Lord and it going to happen right yes sir oh yeah we coming back to that right come on but you say but the point it is the problem we've been dealing with we have been dealing with this body this body is out of this body right here that we got now and God didn't intend for us to stay in this body right we in other word god ain't going to raise up a god a you know a lot of time people say redemption in is not based on replacement God ain't going to replace you with another body you ain't going to go down you ain't going to go down you ain't going to go down in this body then God say I'm going to go over here and find another body but he going to take this body right here and he going to raise it back up or changing amen into a glorified condition Hallelujah and into a glorified body Hallelujah and then we die before the rapture we go into a the body and in the resurrection we come back to the Earth and pick up a glorified body right because we canot eat a any body right and we going to Mar supper H we going to Mar supper we going to eat H God required us to eat H so we go to a mar supper so we can eat H but this body right here when brother was called to Pastor curtain of the time he went he went in the presence of God H like brother like brother brother brother Wayne was preaching this morning in Sunday School he stepped into that body and he goes he was perfect he was perfect he he he had the perfect love and that perfect love carried him into a real of the Supernatural and he saw the sa and theology bodies but he never saw Jesus right he wanted to see Jesus Hallelujah but the point of it will why did he see Jesus because if he would have saw Jesus he would have broke the order of the Resurrection right right amen he would have he would have been completely a would broke the heart of it right only when we see Jesus standing on a cloud he not in the of body he come back in a glorified body and we would alive and remain it changed right here the M immortality we're not meeting them in anybody we meeting them in glor B and we going to a wedding and I need to keep this shirt everywhere man praise God me the Mana fell back amen I didn't know all this was going to come out myself H finish so we realize here so now we realize here that was God he trying to get us he's trying to get us to see right here he's not concerned about he he's concerned about the bride Landing the presence of the word until the word become flesh amen right that's right you know here I say we been we've been trying so hard and that's F people everywh you go but we God is concern trying to get us back to where Adam fell from right Adam fell for eternal life in a body and you know we sing that song I hear people sing that song I'm going to take back what the devil took from me and I'm going to put it under my feet you know we said here I said but the devil never took nothing from us hallelujah devil got what God had already cursed right he got the Earth but our Eternal destination the gene of God went back to the book of God the lamb Book of Life he would not yet the devil filthy hand put his put his hand on the actra god knew who you was s never took eternal life from us how do God say when I go I'm going to not let the devil put his hand on there but the Earth is cursed right and that what we dealing with we dealing with cursed earth like brothers like you say to he the five senses we got to deal with the the things that contact this Earth the spirit realm reason cont imagination all these we dealing with those why cuz Satan got access to theere that nature that fell but down on the inside there amen come on that real you he cannot touch that why because God won't let s put his filthy hand on the child of God hallelujah you I mean this is the best in people that's right Seven Seals is there I see you know a lot of people say brother Jew in other words I heard I hear the brother was using the ter he said brother jeel he said when the Seal's open he said brother Brandon the come back and open the seal I said I was reading that for myself let me say something people that thought right there will not pass why because I want to let you understand when brother when the angel was in Revelation 5 say who can open the book if you remember he under the Earth got it and he looked in heaven he seen the Theology of will Brandon and will Brandon was not worthy to do it then a lamb stepped out of Eternity H been bloody what was it it was God that came down God was those S CS God was the mystery AG Christ is the mystery of God reveal Luke Don't Preach part of it but it was Christ that done it it was never a man that opened the seal and it never was a because there was not even worthy in heaven to do it Jeremiah was not worthy Joseph wasn't worthy Moses wouldn't worth but he needed somebody that was worthy right he needed a kid Redeemer right right come on brother Hallelujah don't not throw that in I thought I just thr that in but we talking about getting back to the body a body a body a word body a word form body that what Paul knew he said I'll lay in pray travail until Christ be formed in you you know when I pray in pregnation when a lady get pregnant she just don't go on a diet at that time that is not the time to say well I'm going to Weight Watchers pregnation do not it's not the time that your wife want to go to Weight Watchers right oh I better watch it I'm pregnant now I need to go to Weight Rock watch it I might get bad no you ain't it ain't no might in it if you eat the right type of a food you going to get fat because that is the law of pregnation if you don't believe me if you don't believe me what's your name of God no right here what your name Brother Joseph ask Joseph I said he's on his way to 13 to kids or more I tell every time I see him he got a baby I mean I'm almost scared to shake the guy head I said man like that boy they dang something hope I just hope every day he say I'm do I I don't know but any way any way I going to say this and he would tell you under the stage of pregnation she didn't stop right right why because that's the time why you think the peoples is getting hungry for the word why you think people that really come into the contact with the Holy Ghost is automatic become a a thirst a hunger for the word why because he that a wound is sealed that the pregnation of the word is here Christ opened the word turn the heart back right right not the body come on the heart has got to be turned and the body going to obey the heart that's right how he come to turn the heart back and N the turning the heart back that was an impregnation amen the wound is Seal right Y and we are we eating on his word we don't have no desire to eat on the denomination carage some man made theory in the message we eating on the word of God H we got a desire to eat the book to eat the Revelation what we are doing we are we are eating we are actually eating ourselves there a resurrection taking Play Already the more you get a desire for God to eat the word there's a body be formed in you your Desir is swallow up by the power of word hallelujah yes sir thank you Lord I want to go here what Jesus in his resurrection after his resurrection he didn't appear to them in another body right that's right look at look l'sen read Mark Mark the 16th chapter verse 12 as they pull this up he did not pray to them he did not appear to them in a in a in a and God raised up another body then it would have been replaced with right hall but the Bible say after he had appeared in a what form not a form unto the two of them as they walked and went down and into the country and the RO may it was what did he do he improved to them in a glorified body that they never realized he was a Young Man how he words other word what did he do what what what made him young again why was Jesus young that body had sheded the blood come on when Jesus released the blood that body went back to the same power that was in Adam right he was the second Adam and then he was you said what you mean when Jesus stepped through the doors yeah now he's stepping through the doors he don't even knock no more he just come up here and this body right here it's got skin on it and all of a sudden he just walk right through the door right hall when they look up he's standing on the inside H what it is that body right there that went back to the same body that Adam went and Thomas look this is not this is something I don't I don't believe this I just can't accept this it ain't no man can do what he just did I don't understand it right Jesus seen the unbelief what did he say Thomas come here I want you to do something put your hand in my side and the prince of my hand he said does a Spirit have flesh and bone on he said give me a piece of that fish and he yet he does a Spirit eat that was not a the body that was a glorified body that was the body that was after the order them when he met give me a piece of bread he came back in there b the shores there that's the last the bride is coming back to a a word body again right right you said do we got a word body no you got a word on the inside you forming the word body H other words you got to get the word on ins side when that woman get pregnant right there her her desire change to eat when my wife got pregnant man she start eating everything cucumbers peanut butter I'm thinking well you don't even like cucumbers and peanut butter you know what's happening it's a deep C to the Deep there different vitamins in the in your body that that you need to eat and you need for that baby that baby might need more calcium so she want to eat bananas all the time her body's not putting off enough calci and I don't know much about you know man they said man don't understand about what they just be pregnant I'm glad I don't yeah right you know right now we don't have to least deal with that boy but you know but the point of it is but the point of it is in word but what it is she she get to craving certain things and she get the craving what the body need in other words if she don't get it then when you born when I was a baby when I was a young guy around around uh maybe around uh three or four years old I like it I would always be craving for chalk I would go to school and eat the chalk that the teacher got I be looking she be right with the chalk I'm saying nothing I but I didn't know that till I come to the m what what that craan was for it was something in there and and if you had stch yes I love to see I just see like I could somebody open that little them women when they got pregnant that red star you know a lot time they be in a little red box man I when somebody would open that starch I wow man it look like it man but I didn't know what it was my body was calling for uh something in my body was calling for it was calling for something and I was trying to find it how like the and like the brother at the little erasers off of his body he had the erasers off why was the body of his body was CAU of a suffer and when you come to the word God know what you need for a change so he give you begin to get a crave to study certain books right right you know some people get a crave and then all of a sudden you just get trapped I didn't realize this to the other day me and my wife was in the process of moving so I got a whole shelf cuz I don't study I I'm not going to say that in a proud way I just don't I had never used a computer right you know and that don't feel bad you got one I I just ain't never done it because I just ain't never took the time to sit down and learn it you know what I'm saying so I we still studyed the oldfashioned way by books and the lady come to me the other week she kind of throw it off on me she said all the preachers I know they all got uh uh iPads you don't got now I said well I got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost said I bring all they of your remembrance I said so it don't really matter I mean God if God anoints you to do that that's up to you and God but the point of it is I'm I just try to yield the inspiration and and read it and study and then when I have need of those things Holy Spirit to bring back to your remembrance but he do that with brother Wade he do brother but he every man got the anointing the way God anointed him to take the message evangelist cannot be a teacher right and a teacher cannot be evangelist right a pastor cannot be evangelist right even though they do it but here we are yeah yeah but leave Al but brother say don't mix it off if I go take a church right now everybody the whole country got it it be a you go to the you go right now if I go to Pastor you could probably go to the Post off and they got my name up there you know say man he ain't nothing better well I know what my call is Right Hallelujah and I I been offered people you won't be surprised the deals I have been offered but by God Grace I said Lord as longer you give me script as longer you give me the anointing to do it I'll stay on the field and I'll preach this gospel until Jesus come H they said one brother told me said well brother jeel he said if you was a real V you will be overseas who going to keep the bride stirred up how do we need to Revival in the US too how we we go to sleep sometime we need to be woke up H hey God got to have somebody that got the American Bride on his mind I told I'm not I said God anoint me to preach in America right I mean I'll go overseas I have nothing wrong with it but I'm just saying what God anointed me to be how you got to know your position right in other words it seemed like I never had the effect overseas I have in America right in other words so I realized God this is where you want me to be right other word Brothers go and have good great success that's them but God ain't anointing me that way and when I found my place I know where it is and when a man found his place that gang of hell when a man get in trouble it he get out of position right right amen when evangelist normally fall into adultery is when he try to take a church and not call for it oh my come on cuz he not anointed to deal with that kind of pressure you said brother how you know I've been a social Pastor twice you said what you do I come out of here you can have your headaches yeah I'm trying to keep my hair black as long as I again I mean you know I know he going to have to get gray but I want to get great before it's time Hallelujah you know word but yeah what I'm saying here but people this is the hour that we living in this Revelation Revelation come to give us understanding of we going to be the generation that going to conquer death on you see well I done conquer death I believe you don't conquer death within if you die you're raised but the point of it is you still ain't conquer death you still C death where them teeth Ain back in your head y that bom spot still there don't come tell me you coner down but when Jesus come out of the Grave when he come out of the Grave his body had conquered death hallu and what did he says all power given unto me in heaven and earth amen H he had conquer death he went down in a body and raised it up and it was young again it was so young that they could even recognize who he is that's right you know you ain't never seen a person Young right you really don't know how to you it's a it's a big change right when you was young and then when you go through you know when you first going to school it's a change you look at the kid when they I remember looking at my pictures in school first grade I'm a te suicide I'm standing there and washed my face and took a picture then later on I took another picture I can't go how far I didn't go I should have went for in school I can remember around eighth grade I took my last picture cuz the KN I ke completely out but here we are and words but I begin to look back at the back at my those yearbooks when I was in school and I don't support Engish by the way right lot of this message have script the young people and have taught them that we don't need an education how we are in the message we are in Simplicity you to be humble that humble that's stupidity right how you going to pay and and keep a mar woman and you got to work at McDonald's we got young guys right now they got enough education they work in hey qts and all this they going to scrugg people yeah I know I didn't been there they going to scrugg and my wife wouldn't have been educated we would have perished right she always hadn't made the money that ain't good right now you don't want no woman to make more money you do I'm just tell you that right now that's a problem yeah yes sir I was glad when she I got to make a little more she did but for years she the one that made the most but the reason it is because we we we we come up under that discip but Sam know what I'm talking about that was old school that's those old thought back in them day you to be humble that mean if you was humble I know how how I get on there and if you was humble you go out and buy you one of the regul cars that you can buy yeah maybe a four cuz you won't find a shet regular but here we are I just thought I throw that in when I had the chance and other words so you go to buy the regular car you can buy and and you put three four quarts of oil in it and you barely make it to church and you get up on the on on on on a new year tonight and you testify I barely made it to church my car burn four quter but I'm so happy that ain't happy that stupidity get rid of the piece of junk ask God to bless you pay your ti so God can bless you with a nice go man you just got to remind people they get some stuff in their mind they helping them to God God don't need your your your self-righteousness humility God need you to become the word and I going to let you know something about the word the word take care all our need God ain't never had a son that was bankrupt you are never find God seat on side the road we'll work for food that's right they did you he said David said I was once young and now I'm old I never seen the righteous forsake all his seed beging bread why I'm not worried about I'm not worried about you they talking about me about when when all this stuff start going about the gas what you going to do brother J I said that's not my problem that's right right I said I never even gave no thought because I know if God want me to keep traveling he going have to do something about the G PR they went down and God going to take care the bride and long as we here they can talk about the G God going to keep it so the bride get to church hallah so we don't have to worry about all that he said I've never seen the righteous for second see beg God see you that they they everything work together for your good and everybody that not even Bri they going to benefit from what you got amen so we looking at revelation we talking about the word body we talking about hereo now you hero because we are coming to this I'm not going to be long today so y'all get ready I'm going jump out of here even though I got the shirt on I'm trying to put my PR Sho on now Hallelujah so in other words so we begin to realize here we're to be pregnant what with the revelation of the Holy Spirit what do this word pregnation that God put in the bride what do it do how do we know that he come he said the seven seal bring Christ back to the Earth Christ is the seals Christ is the word and Jesus said when I come how will you know he here he said because I will bring all things to your remembrance thing in the word it ain't you just catching your own mind you are catching the mind of Christ the Capone is mind everything that he said he's bringing it back to your remembrance right you begin to remember where you come from see you know we might have been daed for a while and we might have been sleeping when Adam remember God put Adam in a deep sleep the Bible said Adam was in a deep sleep but if you read the Scripture it never woke him up but then after you go did you noce that it never woke him up he was sleep God but when he you know when we say woke up but the Bible don't say that that he brought e to him so we realize here when did Adam get woke up when Adam SE got woke up and we B we found in Matthew 25 here come the bridegroom coming and the bride walk where we've been sleep when a man sleep you you know it's something about being sleep people can be sleep one time my with brother Dan Daisy me him was in we was in uh GH West Africa and brother Dan was sick real sick he had these little pills he said brother you you want to take one he said it'll help you sleep I thought to myself y I need a rest we've been in the motel for two days cuz I brother Tim and brother another brother was win brother Charles L they went on preaching they went on preaching brother Dan was so sick he couldn't go no further so I told Brother T I said I'll stay back with brother Dan and to make sure that he can you know have water make sure if I can do something for her so me and brother Dan spend two or three days together we stay back in this big nice Motel a condition the other guy was sweating it out back this is life we got so bored we we got so Bor we even look at Bruce Lee but here we are I'm sorry y' didn't for tell it but here we are said brother youel he said it's boy a I said brother it's so we you know you said m three or four day come on people yeah right we done studied we done read he we looking at each other he said brother Jewel I said what he said do you like karate I said I love it he said this is our secret he said we going to look at that K Fu station man me him look at karate all day long yeah man I went to sleep I thinking garate all two weeks but either way but there they take this pill and I took it and I I was sitting there for a few minutes and all of a sudden some little monkey something my lights just went out I don't know what pull the switch I don't know all I know I was standing there the last thing I remember me and brother D were talking and I didn't remember nothing from that point I guess I was counting eight and 10 backwards whatever happened it's said clicked and then next day I woke up but let me just show you about being as sleep brother Tim come into the room where I was and he start talking to me and I I raised up out of the bed and me him was having this conversation and I was talking to him he was talking to me and all of a sudden brother Tim looked in my eye he said this guy's still asleep I mean I'm answering his question but I was still asleep for seven Church edes yeah that Bri they laid there and they had a Gloom on right but then why said the seven DS woke up right why because we were sleep we were in the world we was Gloom we couldn't see where we come from like like you said this morning looking through that all we can see is that but when them picture open the whole glass open and we see him face to face the bride in the word is the same person Glory hallelujah amen amen but I'm want going to deal with this here so we got to we we we going back to the form of a word body and you said brother what going to do it you're not going to do it metamorphis is not you done it manam morph is that you was already by predestination you was already a Son of God right you didn't become Sheep by rebirth you always with sheep God don't change species right you not you can't be a sheep and be made into a monkey cuz they were seed is of his kind so we begin to look here so we begin to look at the prophet of God he begin he begin to try to show us what what what we coming from and and the revelation of who we are so I'm going to use a quotation what brother used in the church Ed book and then when I use this one here in a church Ed book in uh uh Brother begin to talk about how to explain church at 152 he would say I want to explain the true bride of Christ in the mind of God eternally th through not express don't not express until until each came forth into the decree that's the the designated decree season as every member came forth It's Express and it took and it and it took its place in a body right we bypass theop we that's why we come to the world a sinner and we come to the word but we hear the Worden and it comes back and we hear it from our theophany that why he say we know Bri recognize just mess been eagle food that's your representation you heard from your the right what it is the word has been formed in you right not not on the outside we got a way out here it's on the inside right how remember the when you went into the king Cham it was not on the outside was in the inside what the kingdom of God a right say within us right amen so the word has been form within us right now and you say brother J is it important that I hear even the little man sometime message seem to be simple we say oh well that Ain that ain't deep enough what what you call Deep yeah come on right that no other deeper Revelation than Christ been formed in you the hope of glory because that's what change your body exactly Romans says he says here Paul said in Romans 8:11 say if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwell in you right it will Quicken your mortal body because God put the seed there to bring you back to a glorified body right now we've been Quicken from the things of the world like he said that sinful that sinful atmosphere of the world that had you under his Dominion that was Satan that never was you that was Satan had you under this Dominion but by the power of the queening power what he do it broke the power of Darkness the seed was laying in the Earth right when the D when the Gloom when that disc D when that all that glue roll roll away from there Earth the seed was already there and it Quicken what was there that what God done brought us before we sons of God and we need to you said brother J do I need to try to do it no you just need to yield to God right H you don't need to try to make it happen it'll happen he said he said this is a is a destinated she is also called the body of Christ it is very uh appearent practic whatever that she ought to be called for the call that she was predestinated him come forth the same s was eternally with with him and and then he go to oh praise God man that help me to see better I know I ain't in no glorified body man okay well man now did the gree I don't read that one right where right there where at to yeah right at the top okay okay go to say this this this designated decrease season even as a m came it expressed and took its place in a body just the bride is the literal spoken word see what and though she is feminine right right and in Destin she is also called the body of who of Christ it and it is very par that she ought to be called that for she was predestinated in him from that same s Eternal with him and is manifested manifesting God in a many M body where as once God was manifested in one member but before he can ever get he come A Man member he had to get a glorified body and release the blood even our Lord Jesus Christ and it goes on and says he said there now then here we are coming to a decl conclusion as Eternal logos God was manifested in the what and and in Jesus dwell the what of the godhead body right and he did he say and that every everyone that was in the father was manifested in flesh and whereby Grant gain the title of the son even so we Eternal in his thoughts see the point of it is God Don't Make No mistake right if you was there God you didn't just wake up and come to church by accident you didn't wake up to want to serve God by accident the reason you had a a desire to serve God because God put a desire you to serve him outside that you want you want free more agency you got a right you don't have to come to church but for some reason you got to thirst don't want to be like God he says here and he says here well may it says here yeah Eternal in his thoughts Eternal in his thoughts Eternal in his thoughts and yeah and I and our turn became the many member spoken word spoken word SE manifested in flesh and those Eternal thoughts now manifested in the flesh are the sons of what and even as we are called that word that called he said we are called right who God he called and what did he do he justified did he glorified if you call you got to come through the stages of the baptism and the Holy Ghost how you say you just don't if he called you he called you so you can come through these stages and he says here and he says here and call so he said we did not become seed by rebirth we were we were seed and therefore we we the we're reborn not only the elect but we can't be reborn only only the elect can be yeah can be reborn because we are to see we we to see is the reason we can be Quicken NSE there is nothing to Quicken none see will never will never become a word body bride they will go out they'll come to this message and the Bible say if we in God then we are conformed to be coming into the image of God when people come to the message and they hear all this truth and they take on some other IM the anointing that fell on them and bringing forth the life of the seed that's in them right it don't it just that see when you come under this and the rainfall and the rainfall and the Sun come if that seed is not if it if it's not of God it will be put forth the anointed ones at the end time yeah let the musicians come man I tell you what I tell what it's a lot I keep going and going and going but y'all got good teachers so y'all when brother Way start on this teacher y'all be he'll be able to finish us out praise God so everybody come on up in know word but we you we becoming a word body right bride God is wanting to put skin on him he want to put skin back on him again how you know we we got people like I said here it's no fun getting old no I I don't care man I mean I I thought I a couple weeks ago
