[3:00] God bless you we're going to read
[3:01] tonight from Jonah chapter
[3:04] 1 and just little take a little topic
[3:07] about um Jonah as
[3:10] well and uh that that was nice that was
[3:14] nostalgic to come from the back I like I
[3:17] like that I enjoy it
[3:28] back we had a good time in in uh
[3:30] Tennessee the last weekend U good to see
[3:34] all the saints brother Cas brother
[3:35] brother kain's church and uh they send
[3:38] their greetings of course
[3:41] um so Jonah chapter 1 verse4 and then
[3:44] we'll read um I think it's verse
[3:49] 17 Jonah uh verse four says but the Lord
[3:53] sent out a great wind into the sea and
[3:55] there was a mighty Tempest in the sea so
[3:57] that the ship was like to be broken
[4:00] and then verse 17 says now the Lord had
[4:02] prepared a great fish to swallow up
[4:04] Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the
[4:06] fish three days and three nights God
[4:09] bless you you can be seated the Lord has
[4:10] blessings to the reading of the
[4:13] word
[4:15] so you know uh uh just these are some
[4:20] interesting things to meditate on how
[4:22] God gave Jonah a big a big old fish and
[4:26] of course you know in another scripture
[4:27] says it was a whale and you think about
[4:29] what a horrible thing that would be to
[4:31] be thrown out of a boat and amen and to
[4:33] be uh uh they they they call that the
[4:37] fear of the deep that thalassophobia or
[4:39] whatever where you look down on the deep
[4:41] and you can't see the bottom and it's
[4:42] just a bunch of bubbles coming up and
[4:44] you look and you see nothing but just a
[4:47] big old great mouth coming up at you
[4:50] amen and um and you think that sometimes
[4:54] that God in in in our life he will
[4:57] allow uh you know we don't we don't get
[5:00] swallowed up by wh naturally but you
[5:03] still go through that's right brother
[5:05] times and things where you get swallowed
[5:08] up by uh circumstances and things and
[5:12] God allows you to get put into a place
[5:14] that begins to move you to where you are
[5:17] supposed to go I remember when I was
[5:19] first seeking the Lord I uh years ago
[5:22] you know you you get into a place where
[5:23] you're like oh God I I got to have I
[5:26] something's got to happen and God begins
[5:28] to it's like you're getting swall
[5:29] followed up by something and now you
[5:32] look you look at uh really I I I I did
[5:36] the AI thing I asked chat GPT what would
[5:39] it be like to be swallowed by a
[5:41] whale and and I just want to read you
[5:44] some of these things you know um it this
[5:46] isn't Doctrine or anything but just it
[5:48] said it would it kind of gave a nice
[5:51] little story that you know one moment
[5:54] Jonah would be thrashing amid crashing
[5:56] waves desperately gasping for breath and
[5:59] then suddenly everything goes dark and
[6:01] Silent as a massive Force Yanks him
[6:05] downward now you you think about the
[6:07] that that Jonah in this case would be
[6:09] like a little like
[6:11] bait and he's here comes here comes the
[6:14] big thing and it grabs him and starts
[6:16] pulling him down in other words what
[6:19] we're describing here is a
[6:21] nightmare he'd be tumbled through a
[6:23] slick tunnel of muscle and water unable
[6:26] to tell up from down in the terror of
[6:29] the those few seconds there's no time to
[6:31] rationalize only to feel the suffocating
[6:33] press of a living creature enveloping
[6:35] him all light
[6:37] disappears Jonah is engulfed in total
[6:40] darkness with no sense of space except
[6:43] the rhythmic squeezing of the fishes
[6:47] enters the walls around him are slimy
[6:50] pulsating with the heartbeat and breath
[6:52] of the creature every few seconds the
[6:53] fish's body shifts pressing him from one
[6:56] side than
[6:57] another imagine the pungent stench of
[7:00] decaying seaweed raw fish guts and
[7:02] stomach acid magnified a thousand times
[7:06] it's an unrelenting assault on the
[7:07] senses like standing in a fish market
[7:09] dumpster on a hot day but far worse the
[7:12] accurate sour smell of digested
[7:15] digestive juices would cling to Jonah's
[7:17] clothes and skin burning his nostrils
[7:20] and throat whenever he inhaled the air
[7:23] is heavy with moisture and wreaking of
[7:26] bow breathing feels labored as if no
[7:28] fresh oxygen can reach his lungs Jonah
[7:31] would probably be panning desperate not
[7:33] to inhale too deeply for fear of gagging
[7:35] on the stench or choking on stomach
[7:37] fluids panic and the confined space only
[7:40] make it
[7:42] worse in Jonah chapter 2 he mentions
[7:44] that seaweed was wrapped around his head
[7:46] so slippery strands of kelp or seaweed
[7:48] might have coiled around his body
[7:49] clinging to his arms and legs his skin
[7:52] would constantly encounter acidic fluids
[7:55] causing itching burning or rawness
[7:57] especially if the fish's stomach started
[7:59] to break things
[8:01] down and fish and whales are
[8:03] warm-blooded or at least they maintain
[8:05] internal temperature different from the
[8:06] Open Sea so inside it's probably going
[8:08] to be humid and and really warm enough
[8:12] to make Jonah just keep sweating and
[8:14] sweating and adding to the sense of
[8:16] claustrophobia and the fish should keep
[8:19] swimming down into the Sea's depths
[8:21] which means Jonah would be constantly
[8:24] buffeted back and forth sometimes
[8:26] feeling weightless other times pinned
[8:29] against the stomach lining and every
[8:31] time the fish gulps water or shifts
[8:33] Direction the Eternal internal pressure
[8:35] changes so Jonah is going to feel sosing
[8:38] liquids around his ankles or even up to
[8:40] his chest at times so he likely felt a
[8:43] gripping Primal Fear the impossibility
[8:47] of the situation still alive but
[8:49] confined in a monstrous creature would
[8:51] trigger claustrophobic dread rapid
[8:54] heartbeat frantic thoughts gasping sobs
[8:58] the very real question is how can I
[9:00] survive even another moment now that's
[9:03] why Jonah in Chapter 2 he said I cried
[9:06] by reason of mine Affliction unto the
[9:08] Lord and he heard me out of the belly of
[9:11] Hell cried
[9:12] I and thou heardest my voice for thou
[9:16] has cast me cast me into the deep and
[9:18] the midst of the Seas and the floods
[9:20] Compass me about all thy Billows and thy
[9:23] waves passed over me when my soul
[9:26] fainted within me I remember the Lord
[9:28] and my prayer came in and into the into
[9:30] thine Holy Temple now you see what what
[9:34] God had really put Jonah into he put him
[9:36] into a little prison and he would
[9:38] actually describe that it felt like that
[9:41] all the Earth all around him was just
[9:43] like the bars of the earth were around
[9:45] him and Jonah's there in the in the in
[9:46] the belly of this fish and the the uh
[9:50] the ribs of this fish actually become
[9:51] Jonah's prison and what it's do is it's
[9:54] is actually setting Jonah up so that
[9:57] well he he he got to go where God want
[9:59] him to go and where he doesn't want to
[10:02] go you know what what this story I I
[10:04] think so many I've been reading that
[10:06] story
[10:08] identification and there's and brother
[10:10] random in that in that sermon he he just
[10:11] talks about character that whole story
[10:13] is about character and and you read so
[10:16] many other stories like uh God is
[10:18] identified by his characteristics and
[10:20] just on and on that really the whole
[10:23] gospel really is almost about it's
[10:25] building up our character that God wants
[10:27] to see our character and you know we've
[10:29] we we we hear the word and we take in
[10:31] the word and and and we'll have the
[10:33] doctrine and whatnot but then what does
[10:35] the doctrine do it actually produces a
[10:37] character it produces a change in your
[10:39] life like that song we were just singing
[10:42] that the word the word that we've heard
[10:43] is is actually changing us so you can
[10:46] actually be known not even so much by
[10:49] the doctrine but by your fruits because
[10:51] your fruits is the character and the
[10:52] fruits is produced by the doctrine then
[10:54] when a man looks at you they can or a
[10:57] woman looks at you they can see the
[10:59] character that's been produced in You by
[11:01] the word of God that you've heard and I
[11:04] you know brother Brown would say a man's
[11:05] character is known by his works whatever
[11:07] you are your Works prove what you are no
[11:10] matter how much you testify whatever you
[11:11] say Pro or con that has nothing to do
[11:13] with it your Works tell what you are
[11:16] tells what you are inside every job that
[11:19] you do manifest what you are and and
[11:22] this story of Jonah I think is is
[11:24] unfolding all these characteristics of
[11:27] of of of who he is and and and who God
[11:30] is and brother an would say he we often
[11:32] prioritize external qualities outward
[11:34] appearances wealth or personal gain over
[11:37] internal character unlike God who values
[11:40] the heart God's looking at what kind of
[11:42] a character we are and what is your
[11:45] character as brother BR would explain in
[11:47] that message identification it's that
[11:49] inquality of who you are that creates
[11:53] like let's say you're like a little
[11:55] planet it creates an atmosphere right
[11:58] and when some people some you know
[12:00] people get around you they find out that
[12:02] your that your character is even it's
[12:04] either a nice atmosphere that they want
[12:06] to be around or it's a kind of
[12:07] atmosphere that that propels them away
[12:10] and they don't want to be around so
[12:11] you're either going to be forgiving and
[12:13] kind and honest and loyal and humble and
[12:16] patient or you're going to have the kind
[12:18] of characteristics that make people want
[12:20] to get away from you just like a planet
[12:22] just like a planet where you know the
[12:24] the the Earth is the third planet from
[12:26] the Sun and it's got life on it and you
[12:28] know you are you know on the moon you
[12:32] probably look down at Earth and and I I
[12:34] like that you know there's life and but
[12:36] look over at Mars or Jupiter and oh
[12:39] that's I I don't like it and so it
[12:42] creates an atmosphere and you create an
[12:43] atmosphere your character creates an
[12:45] atmosphere and what I'm getting at is
[12:48] Jonah had a character and this all these
[12:50] characters in the story had
[12:52] characteristics that that this story is
[12:54] actually unfolding as we look at you
[12:57] know that that well represent it's a
[12:59] type of death and living hell and and we
[13:03] we as we examine Jonah's character we
[13:05] might wonder well how how'd you end up
[13:07] in a wh's
[13:08] belly brother Brandon would say Jonah
[13:10] wasn't backsliding we always talk so
[13:12] much about Jonah being backsliding and
[13:14] everything he said I've always took up
[13:16] for Jonah I do not believe that Jonah
[13:18] was backslid but Jonah was righteous and
[13:23] what that means is that Jonah steps
[13:27] because he was righteous everything that
[13:29] he did was actually ordered by God now
[13:32] that's that's the that's the thing we
[13:34] start thinking sometimes when things go
[13:36] bad and we start getting squeezed by
[13:37] life and get into a bad spot we start
[13:40] thinking well well things go go back
[13:42] like that sermon brother R preach be
[13:44] certain of God and if you've done
[13:45] everything right and if you prayed up
[13:48] and you and you've you've repented and
[13:50] and and and everything's lined up right
[13:52] then you can trust and be confident that
[13:55] everything is ordered exactly the way
[13:57] that God wants things to go
[13:59] now now isn't that a comfort tonight to
[14:02] know that God is mindful of you he's
[14:04] mindful of your situation and your foots
[14:06] are footsteps are just as ordered as
[14:08] Abraham's footsteps were that everywhere
[14:10] Abraham took a step that his feet were
[14:12] ordered that he uh he took possession of
[14:15] the land and and just in that same way
[14:17] that's where in Psalm 37 it says the
[14:19] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[14:22] Lord and He Del lith in his
[14:24] way brother random said and behold a
[14:26] greater than Solomon is here he said
[14:28] Jonah was the prophet many people
[14:30] condemn Jonah and say well he was an old
[14:32] backslider he wasn't backslid the steps
[14:35] of the righteous is ordered of the Lord
[14:38] so if God is on your side there is
[14:39] nothing out of cater amen there's
[14:42] nothing out of
[14:45] cater Jonah was called to Nineveh but he
[14:48] was supposed to go to Tarsus Now isn't
[14:50] that interesting thing that that the
[14:52] whole story actually is ordered exactly
[14:55] the way that God wanted it to unfold
[14:56] that he called him to go to Nineveh but
[14:59] but he went to Tarsus but God wanted him
[15:01] to go to Nineveh and he was supposed to
[15:02] go to Tarsus what a what a strange thing
[15:05] supposed to head towards Tarsus we'll
[15:07] say he's supposed to head over that way
[15:09] because the whole story has got to
[15:11] unfold in the way that God wants it to
[15:13] unfold that's why you know we were
[15:14] studying in First Corinthians that that
[15:17] judge nothing before the time until the
[15:20] Lord come who both will bring to light
[15:21] the hidden things of darkness and will
[15:24] make manifest the counsels of the heart
[15:27] and then shall every man have Praise of
[15:29] God I think you know as that story of
[15:32] Jonah unfolds it actually manifests the
[15:34] character of Jonah it's manifesting the
[15:36] characteristics of the people on the
[15:37] boat it's manifesting the
[15:39] characteristics of the people in Nineveh
[15:41] as the story unfolds it's actually
[15:43] manifesting character did do you realize
[15:45] that ASO the closer we get to the coming
[15:47] of the Lord as as as the seals are
[15:49] revealed and it's just a side effect
[15:52] that you're going things are mysterious
[15:54] things are suddenly going to become
[15:57] known in other words things that were
[15:59] hidden for a long time well all of a
[16:00] sudden it's in plain view secret
[16:03] thoughts are being revealed secret
[16:06] characteristics are being manifested in
[16:08] Luke chapter 8 Jesus talked about how
[16:11] that no man when he ha lighted a candle
[16:13] coverthe with a vessel put putteth it
[16:16] under a bed but settle Seth it on a
[16:18] Candlestick that they which enter in may
[16:21] see the light for nothing is secret that
[16:23] shall not be made manifest neither
[16:25] anything hid that shall not be known and
[16:27] come abroad now Jesus is talking in a
[16:30] two-fold manner there he's talking in
[16:31] one place that the word the mysteries of
[16:34] the word are going to be revealed
[16:35] they're eventually going to be revealed
[16:37] but he's also talking about what about
[16:39] the mysteries of Our Lives what about
[16:41] the secret things that we do that we
[16:43] think that we're getting away with that
[16:45] things that are done in in Hidden and
[16:46] secret and and whatnot eventually
[16:49] eventually it's all going to come to
[16:51] light oh oh I I you know I I'd rather
[16:54] get things just get things out in the
[16:55] open you know we sometimes we'll we'll
[16:58] the Mist M we make so many times is we
[17:00] just sweep things under the rug and we
[17:02] think it's going to take care of itself
[17:04] and years later we find out that it you
[17:06] know the things that we left unresolved
[17:09] are still unresolved and we still got
[17:11] the same problems so let's take all
[17:13] those things that we swept up under the
[17:15] rug and lift lift up that corner of the
[17:17] rug and get it out in the open where
[17:19] everybody so the light can shine on it
[17:21] you know under the under the rug is
[17:23] where all them dead cockroaches and
[17:24] stuff are under the rug is where all the
[17:26] little pill bugs and things are the pull
[17:29] that rug and let the light shine on it
[17:30] and then let everything let everything
[17:32] be right there in the open now that's
[17:34] what Proverbs 28 says he that cover his
[17:37] sin shall not Prosper but who so
[17:39] confesseth and forsaketh them shall have
[17:42] mercy and Isaiah 29 says woe unto them
[17:45] that seek deep to hide their counsel
[17:47] from the Lord and their works are in the
[17:49] dark and they say who seeth us and who
[17:51] knoweth Us Now isn't that isn't that
[17:54] just a human condition who who sees what
[17:56] I'm thinking about in private who sees
[17:58] that that website that I'm looking at
[18:00] when everybody thinks I'm just a goody
[18:02] too Christian and who sees who sees all
[18:05] of my hidden things but it's going to be
[18:08] revealed sooner or later and what what's
[18:10] being revealed God is actually allowing
[18:13] our character to manifest you know
[18:16] brother R preached that sermon the
[18:17] Masterpiece that talks about that after
[18:19] God built up this masterpiece over time
[18:22] by the word down Through the Ages
[18:25] eventually it's he he takes the cover
[18:27] off of it and it's revealed what he's
[18:29] been working on all the time now see as
[18:32] he in this age that we're living in this
[18:35] is the age of revealing this is the
[18:37] manifesting time that the cover has been
[18:39] pulled completely off the word so
[18:41] there's no there's no Darkness
[18:43] everything's been completely revealed
[18:45] from the Genesis to re to Revelation the
[18:47] cover has been pulled off of the Bride
[18:49] the cover has been pulled off of Christ
[18:51] the cover has been pulled off of the
[18:53] devil what that's what the seals do is
[18:55] they reveal all the secret hidden
[18:58] tactics of the enemy and and everything
[19:00] has been being revealed and what's what
[19:02] is it it's it's all the character our
[19:04] character is being revealed our
[19:07] character who we are is being revealed
[19:10] the character of Jonah the character of
[19:12] Nineveh the character of those men on
[19:14] the boat and the character of God how
[19:17] how does God act in this
[19:19] situation and you know you look at you
[19:22] look at Jonah's character going to tarus
[19:24] seems completely contrary to personal
[19:27] ambition
[19:29] you know God Deliver Us from ambition
[19:32] you know what ambition is ambition is
[19:34] like you got you know when I'm at work
[19:36] it's like everybody that I get on those
[19:38] conference calls we they all got
[19:40] ambition and I'm I'm I just I just want
[19:42] to provide for my family
[19:44] y'all they they got they they want to
[19:48] give up their life and their freedom and
[19:50] their Liberty work work 12 15 hours a
[19:52] day and and and and and and because they
[19:55] they've got such lofty lofty career
[19:57] goals that they want to they want to
[19:59] achieve something in this life or or you
[20:02] know ambition could be personal personal
[20:04] growth you want to be a better version
[20:06] of yourself so now you know there's a
[20:08] lot of things you can do at at the
[20:10] self-help section of the bookstore to
[20:12] make yourself better but the Bible says
[20:14] that you can't make yourself taller by
[20:16] adding one thought you can't increase
[20:17] one stature of yourself it takes the
[20:19] word of God to change you and to give
[20:21] you real personal growth so we can have
[20:24] all these Ambitions of things and it
[20:26] won't actually come to to to anything
[20:28] and what is ambition it's our
[20:30] self-will you see what I'm talking about
[20:32] tonight is I'm talking about when God
[20:34] calls a man when God calls you to the
[20:37] new birth or when God calls you to to to
[20:40] to walk with him or whatever God's
[20:41] calling you to do he can't use your
[20:44] ambition he can't use your self- will
[20:47] brother Ram said the greatest enemy that
[20:49] we have is ourselves that is when we
[20:51] feel like we can we feel when we feel we
[20:56] know when you feel like you know or
[20:59] you're the best or you're you're the
[21:00] best of all the rest or you're the one
[21:02] that's going to teach everybody else how
[21:04] to do something that God can't use any
[21:07] of that now now that's see that's the
[21:09] difference between calling and ambition
[21:12] Now isn't it odd though that many times
[21:14] God would C to somebody like Moses or
[21:16] somebody that in the 40 Years of
[21:18] wilderness or Paul running down to Egypt
[21:20] or or or Gideon and all these different
[21:22] characters and he would use that but he
[21:24] wouldn't use the big shot high priest or
[21:26] the different ones that that had all the
[21:29] worldly ambition and and college
[21:31] education and all those different kind
[21:33] of things what what what I'm getting at
[21:35] is our human abilities are secondary to
[21:38] divine intervention brother R said you
[21:40] must allow him to get you to that
[21:43] condition he cannot use you if he
[21:45] doesn't make you feel and know you're
[21:48] nothing that's right now that's what the
[21:50] whale is for and I'm so glad that God
[21:53] has given us whales in our life the
[21:56] whale the whale of circumstances to come
[21:58] along and feel like you're in your own
[22:00] little personal hell feel like you're in
[22:03] your own little personal nightmare that
[22:05] God can begin to mold you and set you on
[22:07] the path to where you're supposed to go
[22:10] to be but he said you you got to come to
[22:12] dust you've got to get to a place that
[22:15] you know that you're nothing and don't
[22:17] never rise above it for as soon as you
[22:20] rise above it you rise above God what's
[22:23] that saying down there where the dust is
[22:26] if you get above that and you're lofty
[22:28] and Ambitions or what you how you think
[22:30] things should be or how how great you
[22:32] think you are that then you have R
[22:35] actually risen above God and I preached
[22:38] on this so many times and I love to
[22:40] preach on it because I I I I just love
[22:42] to meditate on humility and and just
[22:45] getting as low as you can because
[22:47] brother R will say we can't do nothing
[22:49] without God but but the scripture says
[22:51] that with God I can do anything now
[22:54] there there's the the the balance is
[22:57] with myself with my own ambition and
[22:59] with all my own thoughts I I'm nothing I
[23:02] can't do anything but Philippians says I
[23:04] can do all three things through Christ
[23:07] which strengthened me so that means when
[23:10] you got a problem at work or you got a
[23:12] problem in your family or your problem
[23:14] in your home life with your own
[23:16] abilities and your own thought you will
[23:18] fail every time you can't do it you will
[23:21] fail every time but if you turn it over
[23:23] to God and and and turn it over to him
[23:25] in your prayer closet and get along with
[23:27] God and let God go to work and then it
[23:29] will always work out we can't do nothing
[23:32] without God but with God I can do
[23:34] anything he brother R would say who are
[23:36] you stick your finger in a bucket of
[23:38] water and pull it out and find the hole
[23:39] you put your finger in then say that was
[23:42] that was me you're nothing you'll not be
[23:44] missed after a little while after you're
[23:45] gone they'll have a funeral procession
[23:48] out here and that's all but what'll keep
[23:50] going on he said and this is a message
[23:53] influence he said but your influence
[23:55] will live on and on and on what what is
[23:58] that your character the impression that
[24:00] your character and your testimony made
[24:02] in life that's going to live on and on
[24:05] and on that people will remember the
[24:07] life that you lived for the gospel in
[24:09] the same way that they remember all that
[24:10] Hall of faith in Hebrews 11 they
[24:12] remember how people died and were sown
[24:14] aunder and gave their lives for the
[24:16] gospel because that's that character
[24:18] that's a testimony that Jesus is Alive
[24:21] and
[24:22] Well when we think we can do something
[24:24] in ourselves now I'm quoting brother
[24:27] Dale some things that brother Dale said
[24:29] cuz brother Dale said when we
[24:31] volunteer that's what CA brother Dale
[24:34] actually said that when we volunteer
[24:36] that is what causes so many problems
[24:39] when we're trying when we're taking our
[24:41] instead of our instead of God actually
[24:43] doing something when we take our own
[24:46] pride and our own ambition and our own
[24:48] vanity and say well I'm going to lift
[24:50] myself up and I'm going to go run and do
[24:52] it you you know that is actually what
[24:55] will make a young person in church that
[24:57] that they'll push p like a little old
[24:59] lady off the piano bench because they
[25:01] think that they can do it better that's
[25:03] what will make somebody some young
[25:05] person coming along in church that'll
[25:06] make them get out of the way you see
[25:08] that Pride am ambition vanity that's
[25:11] actually contrary to the real character
[25:14] that God is trying to produce in his
[25:17] bride pride and it lifted up you know
[25:20] brother R would say that Paul before his
[25:21] conversion he had
[25:23] ambition he had an ambition and he said
[25:26] to find out that this great ambition he
[25:28] had been trained for and had spent all
[25:30] of his life from maybe the age of about
[25:33] 8 or 10 years old up to about 30 or 35
[25:35] when he finished college and graduated
[25:38] and had all of his diplomas and
[25:39] everything and stood in good with all
[25:41] the clergy even to the high priest at
[25:42] Jerusalem he had orders from him
[25:45] personal orders written and trusted with
[25:47] this great Saul to go down to Damascus
[25:49] and to find all those down there that
[25:51] worshiped God contrary to what he said
[25:54] and to bind them and put them in jail if
[25:57] necessary he had orders to put them de
[25:59] to death if he wanted to he had great
[26:05] ambition in other words he was convinced
[26:07] that he could do it and God cannot use a
[26:10] man that thinks he can do it Paul
[26:13] started out so excited at what he could
[26:15] do what he could accomplish and brother
[26:17] Ram would say now all that he had
[26:19] trained for God had took it all out of
[26:23] him you know to think that road to
[26:25] Damascus changed Paul before before he
[26:29] had all that ambition of himself but
[26:32] after he was changed to look at things
[26:35] differently that road to Damascus took
[26:38] away it took away his brother ra said it
[26:41] like this it took away his I can do
[26:45] it and you know what his Paul his
[26:47] ambition amounted to I I love the way
[26:50] that brother brand frames this up he
[26:52] said Paul's Ambitions it what he had his
[26:54] thumb on the saints of God having your
[26:57] thumb on somebody is like this it's old
[26:59] saying that they used to say in the 17th
[27:01] century that means that your thumb is so
[27:04] big and the person that your thumb is on
[27:07] so little that your thumb becomes this
[27:09] big giant thing that you can just push
[27:11] somebody down with and now that's what
[27:14] Paul's ambition became it was just
[27:16] something that he could just push
[27:17] somebody down with when he was changed
[27:19] he didn't want the world under his thumb
[27:21] anymore a man like that brother R said a
[27:24] man like that wouldn't put a Ministry or
[27:26] a world under his thumb he'd put under
[27:28] his master's thumb cuz he's not here
[27:31] representing himself he's representing
[27:33] his master now now isn't that just a
[27:34] beautiful way to think that we're not
[27:36] supposed to be under a man's thumb or a
[27:38] man's ideas but we're actually supposed
[27:40] to be under God's Thumb that not not
[27:43] under not under a man's ideas or under a
[27:45] man's control but under God's control
[27:48] amen and when God gets you under his
[27:50] control then now you're at liberty I I I
[27:52] you know I pray this is my prayer for
[27:54] myself and for the church that we'll
[27:56] never be under the thumb of a
[27:57] denomination system and never be under
[27:59] the thumb of man never be under the
[28:01] thumb of the devil where the devil's got
[28:03] you all HED and bound under the thumb
[28:06] never under the thumb of any man-made
[28:08] system but always have Liberty under the
[28:10] Master's thumb aren't you glad tonight
[28:13] that that's what the ministers that God
[28:14] has sent the fivefold ministry he didn't
[28:16] send us to put our thumb on people but
[28:18] to tell us what the master wants done so
[28:21] that God can have control and dominion
[28:23] over our life amen and the master called
[28:25] Jonah to go to Nineveh it said said now
[28:28] the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the
[28:30] son of amiti saying arise go to Nineveh
[28:33] you know what's weird about that is is
[28:35] that Jonah didn't get any
[28:37] [Music]
[28:40] visitors now this is I I just meditating
[28:43] on the power of
[28:44] Revelation that he didn't get any phone
[28:46] calls he didn't get any letters he
[28:48] didn't have a big old Caravan of camels
[28:50] coming parading to his house to say that
[28:53] it's time to go to Nineveh and you know
[28:55] what Revelation is it's fundamentally
[28:57] the disclosure osure or unveiling of
[28:59] truth that is not derived from Human
[29:02] reasoning or intellect but is imparted
[29:05] by God Amen and Revelation is a process
[29:08] by which Divine truths are revealed to
[29:10] humans through spiritual Insight rather
[29:13] than through empirical evidence or study
[29:15] so in other words Revelation don't come
[29:17] from education you know I believe we're
[29:19] living in the day and the hour that that
[29:21] that that that is manifesting now where
[29:23] I just talking to different believers
[29:26] they talk about you know Ministry
[29:28] speaking that somebody's going to have a
[29:30] baby or you know uh turning turning
[29:33] around and and speaking a word of
[29:34] encouragement to somebody playing the
[29:35] piano and and what that is is you know
[29:38] Revelation is not just understanding the
[29:41] word of God but it's actually opening up
[29:43] a channel where God can speak to you and
[29:45] reveal things to you and tell you what
[29:47] you need to go what you need to do and
[29:49] where you need to go this is why in the
[29:51] Scripture it says the spirit of truth
[29:53] will lead and guide you into all truth
[29:56] in other words that God can go speak to
[29:58] to a man and tell him what he needs to
[29:59] do that you need to go you need to go
[30:01] get baptized that you need to go and be
[30:04] born again that you need to go find a
[30:05] good church and speak to you and tell
[30:07] you what where where to get a good job
[30:09] or whatever and will actually guide you
[30:11] just like he told Abraham to get up and
[30:13] travel just like he'll tell a minister
[30:15] in a prayer line how to pray I know my
[30:18] own children have had so many
[30:19] testimonies of being in a prayer line
[30:21] and that Minister prayed exactly what my
[30:23] need was it got honed down exactly what
[30:27] I was seeking and and prayed exactly
[30:29] what I needed to hear Revelation told
[30:32] Philip to go to the Ethiopian church and
[30:34] revelation will give you revelation will
[30:36] give you not just understanding of the
[30:38] word but understanding of how to deal
[30:41] with situations in your life and with
[30:43] your family and and how to do so he got
[30:45] a visitation from God that revealed to
[30:47] him what he needed to
[30:49] do and John only goes as far away in the
[30:52] opposite
[30:53] direction I was listening to a sermon I
[30:55] think I think it was Aon mcgi that
[30:57] preached it and out in Arizona that he
[30:59] said he said this statement he said
[31:00] Jonah says not on your
[31:04] life not on your life I ain't going to
[31:09] them so he takes a ship to
[31:11] Tarsus and you would
[31:14] think now don't you just love to
[31:16] meditate on the word of God and meditate
[31:19] on like really really think about what
[31:22] is unfolding what a weird thing for a
[31:25] man to hear a direct revelation from God
[31:29] and then he not do it you would think
[31:33] that a man that received a direct
[31:35] message from God will be quick to
[31:36] fulfill
[31:38] it this this story is unfolding
[31:41] characteristics character right we find
[31:44] that just in the scripture just about
[31:47] anybody that was anything resisted the
[31:48] weight the weight of the
[31:51] calling because a calling is not
[31:53] ambition and it's not
[31:55] self-promotion but what what is a
[31:57] calling
[31:58] is a calling is a Divine summons in
[32:02] other words it's like that whale coming
[32:04] up out of the water say get over
[32:06] here and as much as Jonah resisted the
[32:10] whale's coming up and it's going to grab
[32:11] him and you know your calling is
[32:13] divinely revealed in the time that the
[32:15] Holy Ghost chooses so you can't make
[32:17] your calling
[32:19] manifest I I I hear so many times people
[32:22] come up somebody was asking me the other
[32:24] day I want to know what my calling is
[32:26] well there's the thing your calling is
[32:28] not just something that you really
[32:29] really want to do to the point that
[32:31] you're going to volunteer for it but I I
[32:35] I I tell you if God is truly calling a
[32:37] man or or calling anybody to do
[32:40] something there's going to be a storm
[32:43] and there's going to be a whale because
[32:46] those things follow your calling amen
[32:49] and that's why God gave us this story of
[32:51] Jonah to so that when you when you
[32:54] identify yourself in the scripture and
[32:56] can read these things about Isaiah and
[32:59] and Esther and all these things and then
[33:01] go read the story of Jonah and recognize
[33:03] your own story in this story and I'm
[33:06] talking about you amen I'm talking about
[33:08] remembering when you got into a place
[33:10] where you were desperate that God got
[33:12] you needed God to to do something amen
[33:15] and God was molding you and using
[33:17] circumstances and using the situation to
[33:19] bring you to a place like he brought
[33:21] Moses to a place Moses standing there at
[33:24] that burning bush well I can't talk I
[33:25] can't do all these things Elijah run
[33:28] into the cave a with all of that power
[33:31] to to speak fire out of heaven and
[33:33] Elijah run into a cave and and Jeremiah
[33:36] saying I I'm too young I can't speak I
[33:39] don't know how to speak for I'm only a
[33:42] youth and brother Dale I've got some
[33:44] quotes here brother Dale would say the
[33:45] call of God Burns so in your heart you
[33:48] can't rest day and night for it you just
[33:51] can't get away from it it's just
[33:53] constantly grinding at you he said in
[33:56] another place just let it come to its
[33:57] place but if it's not digging at you
[34:00] then let it come to its
[34:03] place he said brother Dale do you think
[34:06] I'd make a good preacher I'd said no
[34:09] don't think you
[34:11] would because I'm
[34:13] not let's just wait a while let's see
[34:16] what God says it about about it down the
[34:19] road
[34:19] somewhere if you volunteer for something
[34:23] you won't ever do it right now somebody
[34:26] was saying to me the other day that's a
[34:27] very confusing way to put that if you
[34:30] volunteer for
[34:31] it cuz that's your own ambition if
[34:35] you're rising up saying well here I go
[34:37] I'm I'm going to go do it then it it
[34:39] won't work right cuz a call is God's
[34:42] will not yours and it's probably going
[34:44] to have little if anything to do with
[34:46] your personal
[34:52] Ambitions look what brother Dell said
[34:55] you got to let it prove out you you got
[34:57] to let it work out to see if it's
[34:59] actually really God or not amen now I've
[35:01] seen I've seen that in my own life I'm
[35:03] I'm going to share some things that I've
[35:04] never shared before here when I when I
[35:06] was actually called of God I I believe I
[35:09] years ago I was I was I was in my little
[35:11] prayer closet and I was reading I
[35:14] believe it was the where Paul told
[35:15] Timothy to study to show thyself
[35:18] approved and and uh don't back up on me
[35:21] I know people think this kind of stuff
[35:23] is weird but I heard a voice that said
[35:25] study hard because one day you'll be
[35:28] preaching this and I held on to that in
[35:30] my in my little prayer closet and you
[35:33] know I didn't run around I haven't told
[35:35] anybody that ever except for my wife I
[35:38] didn't go running around telling
[35:39] everybody bless God I heard a direct
[35:42] Revelation from God which is what what
[35:45] most people I I'm sorry to say not
[35:48] trying to say nothing or whatever but
[35:49] many people would run around trying to
[35:51] make something but you see you got to
[35:54] wait until wait until what wait until
[35:56] the gift is ready recognized wait until
[35:59] other people can now this goes for
[36:01] anything if you you say you got a gift
[36:03] to play piano or whatnot and you're
[36:04] ready to go boot somebody out and ready
[36:06] to go change change the world and
[36:08] everything you wait until other people
[36:11] recognize that gift and the gift will
[36:14] actually open up the door and I you know
[36:17] I I I told the Lord when when when that
[36:21] happened I said if you want me to preach
[36:22] the gospel you have to put me behind the
[36:25] pulpit that's right amen cuz I ain't
[36:28] putting myself behind the pulpit
[36:31] amen and I remember years went by and
[36:35] one day I was standing outside and and
[36:37] and brother Wade said I'm going to have
[36:39] you teach Sunday school and it was like
[36:42] uh in that moment I could feel like a a
[36:45] light from Heaven Just Like Heaven open
[36:47] it up something is about to happen of
[36:51] course you you don't tell anybody you
[36:54] got to wait for things to unfold amen
[36:57] you just wait and you're and you're
[36:59] waiting for for you know hey maybe it
[37:02] just don't work out maybe I'm not that
[37:04] great or or whatever you know whatever
[37:07] you want to so you wait what are you
[37:08] waiting for others to recognize the gift
[37:11] amen then you I'm I'm talking about
[37:13] calling now see this is you you can't
[37:15] just run into something I remember years
[37:18] went by and and brother Terence would
[37:20] come over and say you know you got a
[37:22] call or whatever to be a minister or in
[37:24] different ones and and one day when I
[37:26] was called to preach I was standing up
[37:28] here serving communion with brother
[37:30] Wade and brother Dale was up here
[37:33] serving communion and he said we're
[37:36] going to have communion where these
[37:38] ministers serve communion and he said
[37:41] these words because we got to get
[37:42] brother Bob behind this
[37:45] pulpit and that is when I went out and I
[37:48] told Brother Dale okay I
[37:52] will here we go yeah in other words you
[37:56] got to it's a calling is different from
[37:58] your ambition you don't volunteer for it
[38:00] you don't run out and say well bless God
[38:04] I'm the one I'm the this all this kind
[38:07] of thing it you're a a calling is
[38:09] totally at odds from
[38:12] self-promotion now that's that's a
[38:14] lesson for that's a lesson for us all if
[38:16] you want to get anywhere in life whether
[38:19] you have a gift to play piano or gift to
[38:22] play guitar or a gift to sing in church
[38:25] you always put yourself like last you
[38:28] always put yourself the very lowest
[38:32] because a calling has nothing to do with
[38:35] ambition or Pride or your own self if
[38:37] anybody's going to be called or put
[38:39] somewhere by God is God going to be
[38:41] doing it and other words you you look at
[38:44] the story of Jonah self-promotion and
[38:47] self-elevation is always is always a
[38:51] sign of poor character right it's always
[38:53] a sign of poor character amen Proverbs
[38:56] 27 says let a another man praise thee
[38:58] and not thine own mouth a stranger and
[39:00] not thine own lips let let somebody else
[39:03] say that you're a good preacher or a
[39:04] good singer whatever because if it comes
[39:07] out of your mouth it just cheapens it in
[39:10] Luke chapter 18 he says I tell you this
[39:12] man went down to his house Justified
[39:14] rather than the other for everyone that
[39:15] exalteth himself shall be a based and he
[39:19] that humbleth himself shall be exalted
[39:22] amen you you know even to the point
[39:25] where self-promotion actually as soon as
[39:27] you promote yourself or lift yourself up
[39:29] boom you got Division if you want to
[39:31] know how to cause division or
[39:33] Schism start promoting yourself you
[39:35] promote yourself over your sibling at
[39:37] home well I'm the better guitar I'm the
[39:39] better driver I'm the better this or
[39:42] whatever and as soon as you start
[39:43] promoting yourself boom you're going to
[39:45] have a fight on your hands because
[39:46] self-promotion always causes Division
[39:49] and that's why you
[39:51] cannot lift yourself up
[39:54] amen amen you can't lift yourself up
[39:57] amen amen in Proverbs chapter 17 it says
[40:01] he that exalteth his gate seeketh
[40:05] destruction to even lift up your gate
[40:08] you seek destruction it's James chapter
[40:10] 3 it says but if you Harbor bitter envy
[40:12] and selfish ambition in your hearts do
[40:15] not boast about it or deny the truth for
[40:17] where you have envy and selfish ambition
[40:20] there you find disorder and every evil
[40:23] practice Philippians chapter 2 says do
[40:26] nothing out of self selfish ambition or
[40:28] vain conceit rather in humility value
[40:30] others above yourselves and Galatians
[40:33] chapter 5 says the acts of the flesh are
[40:35] obvious selfish ambition dissensions
[40:38] factions those who live like this will
[40:42] not inherit the kingdom of
[40:49] God Proverbs Chapter 13 says where there
[40:52] is
[40:53] Strife there is
[40:55] pride I was talking to a deacon up in
[40:58] Ohio years ago about how that he he's
[41:00] managed many different Transitions and
[41:02] things and he's he's like you always
[41:04] you'll always have that one that's like
[41:06] I'm I'm the one I'm going to do it and
[41:08] then you always have ones that are
[41:10] trying kind of trying to get away from
[41:12] it and it's like the ones that lift
[41:14] themselves up and try to try to say I'm
[41:16] the best one for the job and are
[41:18] actually fulfilling that scripture in
[41:19] Luke chapter 14 that says if you're
[41:21] biding to a wedding sit not down in the
[41:24] highest room cuz cuz in other words the
[41:26] parable FS that eventually you're going
[41:28] to if you ain't supposed to be there
[41:29] you're going to eventually be doing the
[41:31] Walk of Shame you'll do the Walk of
[41:33] Shame back to where you go right and
[41:36] because that's what when when God is
[41:37] calling a man he isn't concerned with
[41:39] his natural abilities and worldly
[41:43] knowledge so here we find an example of
[41:46] all of us every one of us we always are
[41:50] running from something we run from
[41:52] trouble we run from responsibilities
[41:55] we're all prone to do that we are more
[41:57] more prone to run than we are to stand
[41:59] and face it out we find ourselves
[42:02] running is what brother brandom said am
[42:06] running what from what from
[42:09] responsibility everything is a
[42:11] responsibility and it's so easy when the
[42:13] responsibilities face us to sh from them
[42:16] and we find out that marriage is a
[42:17] responsibility in all manners even many
[42:19] times we find this is hard to say but
[42:22] it's true that ministers many times Sher
[42:25] a responsibility for standing for the
[42:27] true word of God where can they're
[42:29] confronted with it they'll Sher that
[42:32] responsibility when truth of the word of
[42:34] God is brought face to face with we
[42:36] human beings we are prone to Sher back
[42:39] until the last
[42:42] resource what was Jonah running from
[42:45] running from that nation of
[42:48] Assyria you know Nineveh Nineveh was the
[42:51] at that time Nineveh was the largest
[42:54] city in the world Nineveh would be like
[42:56] that City in Los
[42:58] Angeles Nineveh was such a big city that
[43:01] sakaru came and he built these big huge
[43:04] things to to Plum the city where they
[43:06] had running water they had everything
[43:08] that they needed in that City and so
[43:10] Jonah is looking at that it'd be like
[43:11] going down in Los Angeles and preaching
[43:13] a sermon and walking through a city that
[43:16] was so big it was like three three days
[43:18] across to walk across that place and and
[43:21] and and and and so of course Jonah is
[43:23] looking at that thing fearing for his
[43:25] life he probably was afraid for life
[43:27] because what the Assyrians were known
[43:29] for their violence and mistreatment of
[43:31] foreigners in other words they were they
[43:34] were Lo known for lack of respect Jonas
[43:38] I think in one place brother said that
[43:39] Jonah was afraid the Assyrians just they
[43:41] just wouldn't listen to him or that his
[43:43] mission would succeed and another place
[43:46] even in Jonah chapter 4 it says Jonah
[43:48] wanted Justice I knew that you are a
[43:50] gracious and compassionate God slow to
[43:53] anger and abounding in love a God who
[43:56] relents from ascending Calamity Jonah
[43:59] was Jonah was afraid to go down to that
[44:01] the largest city in the world the
[44:03] capital of the Assyrian Empire a
[44:06] powerful and brutal Nation known for its
[44:09] cruelty and warfare and
[44:12] oppression of other peoples afraid of
[44:15] all those murderers afraid of all the
[44:17] things that they were doing you know the
[44:19] process of Jonah running begin to
[44:21] manifest all these characteristics and
[44:23] Jonah and in verse three it says Jonah
[44:25] Rose to flee un tarus from the presence
[44:28] of the Lord cuz japa represented the
[44:30] easy way
[44:32] right and then uh we just keep going on
[44:36] I'm not I'm not going to stay long
[44:37] tonight but look when he got in that
[44:39] storm he got out on the boat on the way
[44:41] to japa the Lord sent out a great wind
[44:44] into the sea and there was a mighty
[44:46] Tempest in the sea so that the ship was
[44:47] like to be broken then the Mariners were
[44:50] afraid and cried every man unto his God
[44:52] and cast forth the Wares that were in
[44:54] the ship into the sea to lighten it of
[44:56] them but but Jonah was gone down into
[44:58] the sides of the ship and he lay and was
[45:01] fast asleep so the ship master came to
[45:04] him and said unto him what meanest thou
[45:05] Oh Sleeper arise call upon thy God if so
[45:09] be that God will think upon us that we
[45:12] perish not and they said everyone to his
[45:15] fellow come and let us cast lots that we
[45:17] may know for whose cause this evil is
[45:20] upon us so they cast lots and the lot
[45:23] fell upon Jonah you know you look at
[45:26] this scene unfold you can tell that God
[45:28] is always in control God is in control
[45:31] of the storm God is even looking at how
[45:34] how this scene unfolds they they're
[45:35] they're trying to figure out whose fault
[45:37] it is so they start casting lots did you
[45:41] never notice that casting lots actually
[45:43] stopped when they cast lots from AAS
[45:45] that's cuz once they got the new birth
[45:48] that's you got a direct line to God yes
[45:50] sir you're supposed to know what to do
[45:53] you don't need to throw a little bone on
[45:55] the floor and figure out which way is up
[45:57] which way is down and whether this bone
[45:58] is touching the other bone and all those
[45:59] kind of thing you don't need any
[46:01] gimmicks because the Holy Ghost gives
[46:04] you person a personal line with
[46:08] God he sent a storm to stop Jonah and
[46:10] you know the storm proved that he was
[46:12] God he was guiding Jonah to his
[46:15] will somebody was to blame for that
[46:19] store they were looking that's what they
[46:21] were looking for was somebody to blame
[46:23] you ever get in one of those situations
[46:24] like in your family you're trying to
[46:25] figure out who to blame whose fault is
[46:27] it and that's just that natural human
[46:29] inclination I got I got to figure out
[46:31] who to blame and this is another
[46:33] characteristic of Jonah is that Jonah
[46:36] ain't blaming nobody
[46:38] else when we get into a fix we're so
[46:41] quick to judge somebody else well you're
[46:43] the one you're the reason you're the
[46:46] this you're the that but Jonah was like
[46:49] I I'm the one right it it's so hard to
[46:52] recognize this is the The Human
[46:53] Condition it's so hard to recognize when
[46:55] we are the problem
[46:57] that's what God gave us the mirror of
[46:59] his word for when we hold up the word
[47:01] and we look at ourselves in the mirror
[47:03] then it exposes all of our faults and
[47:06] all of our failings and then we can
[47:08] begin to change and see things
[47:10] differently Jeremiah 17 it says the
[47:13] heart is deceitful above all things and
[47:15] desperately wicked who can know it it's
[47:17] like King David when he he he he uh did
[47:21] all what he did with bash Sheba and
[47:23] everything and he he just would not
[47:25] admit that he was the problem until
[47:27] Nathan the prophet came and pointed his
[47:28] finger at him and said you are the man
[47:31] gave him that Parable and you are the
[47:33] man that's it's so hard for us to admit
[47:35] when we're the one that's done something
[47:37] wrong amen they couldn't have peace
[47:39] until Jonah was on his way to Nineveh
[47:41] you know sometimes we're look at things
[47:43] the wrong way they weren't trying to get
[47:46] n of a Jonah cuz that's
[47:49] ambition but they were trying to get
[47:51] Jonah to Nineveh right that's a
[47:55] calling and he said unto them take me up
[47:58] and cast me forth into the sea so shall
[48:00] the sea be calm unto you for I know that
[48:03] for my sake this great Tempest is upon
[48:06] you and he threw up his hands and
[48:09] surrender brother R would say there's no
[48:11] way of getting out of it when God ever
[48:13] takes out after you you might you just
[48:15] might as well give up and go on that's
[48:18] that's all you know I wonder tonight if
[48:21] there's somebody here that God is after
[48:23] that they've been running and maybe
[48:24] they're in the belly of the whale of of
[48:26] of of Mind battles and and travail in
[48:29] their spirit and and and trying to get
[48:31] away from the thing that they know that
[48:33] they got to run to come it's time to
[48:35] jump out of the boat it's time to say
[48:37] well I'm the one I'm the I'm the reason
[48:39] why I'm in this pickle I I'm the reason
[48:42] while I'm in this situation and you know
[48:44] there's a real a real symptom of God
[48:46] calling you and God drawing you is that
[48:49] in your situation in your predicament
[48:52] well you're miserable you're you're
[48:54] miserable and you'll never be miserable
[48:57] free until you give in what God is
[48:59] trying to do and brother R would say
[49:01] he's after you you might Dodge over here
[49:03] and Dodge over there but you'll be
[49:05] miserable until you come back and do the
[49:08] thing you started out for him to do amen
[49:10] at the first place now there's a real
[49:12] symptom of calling is it it makes you
[49:14] miserable if you're called to preach and
[49:17] you don't preach then you're going to be
[49:20] miserable that's why brother Dell used
[49:22] to say years ago run run as long as you
[49:24] can run why to see if you're going to be
[49:27] miserable or if you're like I might as
[49:29] well do it I I think that I would be a
[49:33] great benefit and and then he said if
[49:35] you do that then you're going to cause
[49:37] so many
[49:40] problems now now think about that that a
[49:44] man that's not called might be able to
[49:46] do it okay but he's going to cause so
[49:49] many problems so many problems down the
[49:52] road so many hiccups so many
[49:55] challenges and in verse 17 of chapter 1
[49:58] the Lord had prepared a great fish to
[50:00] swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the
[50:02] belly of the fish 3 days and three nice
[50:05] surrounded by complete
[50:08] darkness no space to move or
[50:11] Escape cramped damp and filled with
[50:14] digestive fluids you know you know what
[50:16] that what that whale was it's a little
[50:18] clamp around Jonah now you've jumped out
[50:20] of the boat now I got you and you ain't
[50:24] going you ain't going to another palm
[50:27] tree covered place like you intended to
[50:30] do to do you are in the whale and I got
[50:34] you what is it's God's taxi service the
[50:36] whale is taking you exactly where you're
[50:39] supposed to go and what's the whale it's
[50:40] the it's misery it's torment it's like a
[50:42] little hell on Earth it's like all the
[50:45] anguish pretty pretty much everything
[50:47] terrible you could think of that we were
[50:49] describing lack of fresh air there's no
[50:51] air it's I'm sweating like crazy
[50:53] impressive heat constant motion of the
[50:55] fish sing right
[50:57] and his Disobedience had led him there
[50:59] and then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his
[51:01] God out of the fish's belly and said by
[51:04] Cried by reason of my Affliction unto
[51:06] the Lord and he heard me out of the B
[51:08] belly of Hell cried I and thou heard my
[51:12] voice for thou Hast cast me into the
[51:15] deep in the midst of the Seas and the
[51:16] floods Compass me about all thy Billows
[51:19] and thy waves passed over me then I said
[51:22] I am cast out of thy sight yet I will
[51:25] look again toward thy ho Holy Temple you
[51:27] know Daniel Prayed toward the temple he
[51:29] threw open his windows and he prayed
[51:31] toward the temple and what does that
[51:32] symbolize it symbolizes is down in the
[51:35] belly of that well a realignment of your
[51:38] heart not to look at yourself not to
[51:41] look at your troubles but to begin
[51:43] looking toward God's word and now the
[51:46] Temple's been torn down over there in
[51:48] Israel and we don't turn our heart
[51:49] toward the physical Temple but we're to
[51:51] turning our heart toward God's promises
[51:54] and when God gets you into a predicament
[51:56] where where life is just squeezing in on
[51:58] you if you start align your heart
[52:00] towards God's toward God's word Orient
[52:04] yourself toward his
[52:07] promises what it represents a spiritual
[52:09] Direction and commitment to what to to
[52:12] I'm I'm now I'm going to do now I'm
[52:15] going to do what you want me to do amen
[52:17] what what prayer is more about the
[52:18] heart's posture toward God than your
[52:20] physical location anyway it don't matter
[52:22] whether you're in a belly the belly of a
[52:24] whale or whether you're up on top of a
[52:25] mountain but if if you Orient your
[52:28] heart that's what prayer is
[52:31] about and the Lord spake unto the fish
[52:34] as the musicians come and had vomited
[52:36] out Jonah upon the dry land and the word
[52:39] of the Lord came un Jonah the second
[52:41] time saying arise go unto Nineveh that
[52:43] great City and preach unto it the
[52:46] preaching that I bid thee so Jonah arose
[52:49] and went un Nineveh according to the
[52:52] word of the
[52:53] Lord and Jonah started to enter into the
[52:56] city a a Day's Journey and he cried and
[52:58] said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be
[53:01] overthrown and you know when Jonah I
[53:04] believe when Jonah's feet hit that sand
[53:06] he he didn't stop preaching until until
[53:09] the scripture says that their animals
[53:12] actually were repenting that they were
[53:14] putting sackcloth on their animals those
[53:17] people in that city were so moved by
[53:19] Jonah's message by his convicting
[53:21] preaching that their they repented and
[53:24] their household repented and their
[53:26] animals were covered in sackcloth and it
[53:28] changed that whole city because God
[53:31] Jonah yielded himself to
[53:33] God you know if you're called this
[53:35] morning or this evening as we stand to
[53:38] our feet you don't need lots to be cast
[53:41] to figure out what your situations in
[53:44] you know that you're the one that God
[53:45] wants
[53:47] amen you know what your situation is
[53:50] this afternoon
[53:53] tonight to think now that no one else
[53:56] can can feel your predestinated slot in
[53:58] life
[54:00] right if God's got something for you to
[54:03] do if God's got a song for you to sing
[54:05] in church or an instrument to play or
[54:09] something to do there's not one other
[54:11] person could fulfill that splot that's
[54:13] slot and you'll be miserable until you
[54:16] find your
[54:17] place brother Randa made this statement
[54:20] he said God was in the boat God was in
[54:24] the storm God was in the fish everywhere
[54:26] he turned God was there see God is there
[54:29] and it'll just keep haunting at you so
[54:32] why do we wait any longer why do we keep
[54:36] waiting I wonder if we bow our
[54:37] heads if you're tired of waiting won't
[54:40] you just lift your hand up to him say
[54:43] God remember me I'm tired of running I'm
[54:46] tired of trying to get away from you I
[54:48] want you I want your presence in my life

[1:00:19] Lord
[1:00:21] tonight you remember brother Ernie
[1:00:23] telling us about that story many many
[1:00:25] years ago preaching about Jonah yes sir
[1:00:28] said that they um they worshiped a naked
[1:00:32] man with no hair on him so when Jonah
[1:00:35] come flopping out of the whale all the
[1:00:36] acid had eat all his made his skin white
[1:00:39] and they said that's a God and then they
[1:00:42] started listening to him and he
[1:00:43] presented to him the God Amen and uh
[1:00:46] it's just a it's amazing how that um you
[1:00:49] know when you go fishing uh if you bass

[1:00:58] it sucks that lure straight down through
[1:00:59] that little bitty hole it opens up and
[1:01:01] goes into his stomach and that's what
[1:01:03] happened to Jonah he got sucked in a
[1:01:04] hole and then all of a sudden he was
[1:01:07] dark and it was stinking and that's the
[1:01:09] way we are a lot of times but you know
[1:01:12] what he was right where God wanted him
[1:01:13] to be so that's just the whole the whole
[1:01:16] plan God had the whole plan worked out

[1:04:08] people um and we sure do appreciate and
[1:04:11] good news at noon has been around for a
[1:04:12] long time I knew Mr beckstein back when
[1:04:15] he first started it way back in the 80s
[1:04:17] early 80s and we would uh donate chicken
[1:04:20] and stuff to him and and um about middle
[1:04:23] 80s and we'd donate chicken to him for
[1:04:25] the uh good news at noon and he just he
[1:04:27] all he took was donations that's all he
[1:04:29] done he didn't he didn't u i mean they
[1:04:31] might have got some funding later on but
[1:04:33] most of it was volunteer work one of our
[1:04:37] um uh dentist Dr Ed Bernett he would go
[1:04:40] there and spend one whole day free
[1:04:42] service one whole day fixed his teeth
[1:04:45] and um and the people can't afford it
[1:04:48] they don't have a house we're going to
[1:04:50] go back to a warm house and some people
[1:04:53] don't have a warm house to go to because
[1:04:56] of many circumstances but I just like to
[1:04:59] pray tonight with for brother um Isaac

[1:05:11] brother Isaac and um the devil's trying
[1:05:14] to stop him from the work and uh we're
[1:05:16] going to pray that that's going to
[1:05:17] reverse amen and that he'll come back
[1:05:20] and uh it sounds serious but to God it's
[1:05:23] not nothing serious that's right he's
[1:05:26] the great physician he we we going to H
[1:05:28] we're going to his book They're going to
[1:05:30] go to their
[1:05:31] books and then tell him he needs to do
[1:05:33] this and that and the other that this is
[1:05:35] this is the problem and the issue and
[1:05:36] may have to have surgery but Jesus
[1:05:40] performed surgery 2,000 years ago Lord
[1:05:43] he took care of every bit of that if
[1:05:44] we'll just believe brother R said if he
[1:05:46] was standing here tonight in the suit of
[1:05:48] clothes he couldn't heal you right and
[1:05:52] that's pretty powerful because you'd
[1:05:53] think man if Jesus was standing here in
[1:05:54] the suit of clothes he'd heal no it
[1:05:55] healed you at Calvary right all he' do
[1:05:57] is turn and look at you and say I've
