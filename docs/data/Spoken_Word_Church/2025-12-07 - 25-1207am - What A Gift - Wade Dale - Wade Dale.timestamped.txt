[4:59] world, looked online. There's no one
[5:02] like Jesus. Amen. He is the answer to

[8:33] I tell you, if that didn't get you woke
[8:34] up this morning, I think the temperature
[8:37] actually increased in here a little bit.
[8:39] That's what we need. We need the fire of
[8:42] God in our lives. Amen. Let's just sing
[8:45] that chorus. While we're all standing,
[8:47] we're going to ask brother uh Kie.
[8:52] You want me to sing another song?
[8:56] You going to Who's doing Oh, you're
[8:57] doing bubble. Okay, let's um wasn't sure
[9:01] about that right there. But you know,
[9:03] we're here. I'll tell you, brother Dale,
[9:05] he used to say, you can't accuse us of
[9:07] being an organization because you know,
[9:09] I tell you, in the upper room, it's just
[9:11] let let the Lord lead how he wants to
[9:14] lead. And that's that's the beauty of
[9:16] worshiping him in our heart. Amen. Let's
[9:19] sing that chorus more uh precious than
[9:22] silver. It's in the key of sea. And
[9:24] we'll sing this as brother Donnie comes
[9:25] up for a responsive reading. Amen. How
[9:28] can you measure God? I think in the book
[9:31] of Isaiah says he's unmeasurable. No
[9:35] matter what you can think
[9:36] materialisticly
[9:38] wise, there's nothing that can compare
[9:40] to him. And and I believe that this
[9:43] little chorus here, it reflects that. Oh
[9:46] Lord, you are
[9:50] more preious
[9:53] than silver.
[9:57] and Lord
[10:00] you are
[10:03] for call
[10:06] and
[10:09] oh Lord
[10:12] you are
[10:15] more beautiful
[10:18] than I must
[10:21] and nothing
[10:23] I desire
[10:26] tears with you. Oh, just sing it to him
[10:29] once more.
[10:32] Oh, and Lord,
[10:36] you are
[10:39] more preious
[10:42] than silver
[10:45] and Lord
[10:47] to God.
[10:49] [Applause]
[10:50] are sweet and
[10:55] oh Lord.
[10:59] You are
[11:02] more beautiful
[11:05] than I
[11:08] [Music]
[11:12] can
[11:14] with you. Amen. Amen.
[11:17] [Applause]
[11:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.

[12:06] and blessed us, Father God, once again.
[12:08] You said, "Where two or more meet, there
[12:10] I'll be also." And Lord, I believe
[12:12] you're here so strong today. And I ask
[12:14] you, Lord, to just continue pouring out
[12:16] your blessings of revelation of your
[12:18] word to us more than anything. Father,
[12:20] it's what we need today so that we can
[12:23] shine to the other people. Folks,
[12:25] Father, I know that there's people in
[12:27] the world that I talk to sometimes. You
[12:29] come on the scene and they're pulled,
[12:32] but they don't understand. And I ask
[12:34] you, Lord, just to bless those people
[12:36] out there, Father, that we're a very

[12:41] Lord, and you just have your way with
[12:43] us. Forgive us of our sins. And Father,
[12:45] bless those that couldn't make it

[12:56] your way with them and bring them in the
[12:58] fold. We ask now, Lord, as we go through

[13:02] Brother Wade as he's bringing your word
[13:04] to us, Father. And he's he's trying so
[13:06] hard, Lord. Just bless him. And you just

[13:11] when he's up here in this pull pit
[13:12] preaching. And all of them, Lord, that's
[13:14] here. We ask now, Father, that the ears
[13:16] be open, the heart be receiving, and
[13:19] Father, as we go to your word, we thank
[13:21] you for this day. We ask these things in
[13:23] your name, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[13:26] Hear
[13:34] my voice, oh God, in my prayer. Preserve
[13:37] my life from fear of the enemy.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; From the secret of the wicked, from the
[13:44] insurrection of the workers of iniquity,
[13:48] &gt;&gt; who wet their tongues like a sword, and
[13:51] bend their bows to shoot their arrows,
[13:53] even bitter words.
[13:57] secret.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; They encourage themselves in an evil
[14:06] matter. They commune of laying snares
[14:09] privately. They say, "Who shall see
[14:11] them?"
[14:17] search.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; But God shall shoot at them with a
[14:26] arrow. Suddenly shall they be wounded.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; And all men shall fear and shall declare
[14:41] the work of God. For they shall wisely
[14:44] consider of his doing.
[14:47] And the righteous shall be glad in the
[14:49] Lord and shall be trusted in him. And
[14:52] all upright in heart shall glory.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the reading of the word.

[23:26] of the earth.
[23:29] [Music]
[23:32] [Applause]
[23:52] You know, some of these songs that we
[23:54] sing during this uh time, some of you
[23:57] might say, well, it's just tradition to
[23:59] sing those songs. But if you listen to
[24:01] the lyrics,
[24:03] &gt;&gt; you can identify Lord of that birth,
[24:06] revelation of one God. You see grace
[24:09] loves pure light, light and life. We see
[24:12] light in his light. There's so many
[24:14] connections that come together if you'll
[24:17] just step out of the tradition.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, speak to me through this
[24:21] song. Let me hear the lyrics. Let them
[24:23] be part of my testimony and experience."
[24:26] And it's beautiful. It's took me many
[24:28] years to get to that point to realize
[24:30] that because sometimes you just walk in
[24:32] this life kind of numb. But sometimes
[24:35] there's that presence of God when he
[24:37] comes by your path. He makes it a whole
[24:40] new way. You listen to the bird sing.
[24:42] You see the sunshine. There's a birth in
[24:44] your own life. And and that's what I can
[24:47] testify this morning.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's light and life in their life.
[24:52] Lord at that birth. Amen. And I really
[24:55] appreciate that. Thank you, Meliss.
[24:56] Amen. Let's um let's sing this song. How
[25:01] great is our God before brother Wade
[25:03] comes out. Amen. We serve a great God.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Greater than all our sins, all our
[25:09] faults, all your situations.
[25:12] From this life into beyond, he'll take
[25:14] us. Amen.
[25:16] Amen.
[25:19] The splender of a king.
[25:24] Oh, he's clothed in majesty.
[25:29] Let all the earth rejoice.
[25:32] Let all the earth rejoice.
[25:36] Yes, he wraps himself in light.
[25:42] Oh, in darkness tries to hide, but trees
[25:48] is his voice.
[25:50] trembles at his voice.
[25:54] How great
[25:56] is our God.
[25:59] Sing with me. How great
[26:02] is our God. And oh, see how great,
[26:09] how great
[26:11] is our God.
[26:16] [Applause]
[26:18] days to which he stands.
[26:22] Oh, when time is in his hands
[26:28] again and in the end.
[26:31] Again and in the end,
[26:35] the God can free our world.
[26:41] Oh, father, spirit, son.
[26:46] The lion in the lamb. The lion in the
[26:50] lamb.
[26:52] How great
[26:55] is our God. Oh, see me how great
[27:01] is our God.
[27:04] Oh, see how great,
[27:08] how great
[27:10] is there always the name above all
[27:13] names.
[27:15] Oh, he's the name above
[27:19] all names.
[27:23] It's worthy of all. Can you praise it?
[27:28] All my heart will see how great
[27:34] is our God. Oh, let's stand this morning
[27:37] and just worship him. For he's the name
[27:42] above all name.
[27:45] And he's worthy of our praise.
[27:51] And my heart will sing. How great

[28:02] and his name is above all names.

[29:07] is our name.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; He's a name above all names.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; He is the name above
[29:16] all names. That's what we'll be from
[29:18] here
[29:20] &gt;&gt; because of that name.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; What that man did
[29:25] &gt;&gt; to give us hope.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; How great
[29:30] is our God.
[29:32] Why? He's the name.
[29:35] Oh, he's the name above all name.
[29:41] He is worthy of our praise.
[29:47] My heart will sing. How great
[29:52] is our God. Sing it to him one more
[29:55] time. How great is our God.
[29:57] Oh my. How great how great is our God.
[30:03] Sing with me. How great
[30:07] is our God.
[30:09] All the world will see.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; How great. How great
[30:15] is our God.
[30:19] Amen. God bless you. Let's give our Lord
[30:21] a hand clap of praise. Oh, it's good to
[30:24] know. Good to know that name and be part
[30:26] of that family because all the whole
[30:29] world is named Jesus Christ.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; And that's who we come today to worship
[30:38] here. Um we are uh happy to see all of
[30:42] you. We do have church on Sundays uh
[30:45] during the year uh not just on Easter
[30:48] and Christmas. So
[30:52] well anyway,
[30:55] but it is a special time. It's a special
[30:58] time for us to come and and enjoy the
[31:01] holidays and you know you can uh we can
[31:03] be real dogmatic about it and but uh I'm
[31:06] going to read you some quotes today
[31:08] where brother Random preached a very
[31:10] wonderful sermon. It's called God's
[31:12] wrapped gift. He preached it on
[31:14] Christmas Day.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Christmas day.
[31:19] So we're going to speak on what a gift.
[31:22] I know sometimes uh my dad never did uh
[31:25] uh preach themes. He just kept right on
[31:28] preaching what we needed. But today, I
[31:31] thought we would kind of since we have a
[31:32] lot of visitors here, we could just drop
[31:35] back and speak about a man that was born
[31:39] a baby.
[31:42] He was wrapped,
[31:44] but he came to be unwrapped.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; He was sealed, but he came to be
[31:49] unsealed. Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; He came in flesh, but nobody understood
[31:56] him being in flesh.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; But that was God's wrapped gift. That's
[31:59] the way he wanted to come.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; He decided to come that way.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; He didn't come the way that the the
[32:06] religious world had him come.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; That's why they hated him. So, God bless
[32:10] you. Good to be in the house of the
[32:12] Lord. Get some of these out of the way.
[32:13] Brother Aaron will be speaking for us
[32:15] Wednesday night. Uh happy holidays to
[32:18] all of you. Now, as soon as we're
[32:19] finished here, we'll go out, get in the
[32:21] car, and go down to the um Hidden Acres.
[32:25] Uh if you don't have the address, follow
[32:26] somebody and we'll give you the address.
[32:28] But it's catered meal for everybody.
[32:31] There are plenty to eat, and we'll be
[32:33] giving out some gifts and stuff down
[32:34] there and honoring our uh ones that uh
[32:39] that do the work here. And u we sure
[32:42] appreciate them and we we appreciate
[32:45] them very very much. And uh you can't
[32:48] have a church. You know, uh brother Bram
[32:50] said, "We're not an organization. We're
[32:52] an organism.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; An organism needs pieces and parts.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Just like a body needs pieces and
[32:58] parts." Because without one without one
[33:01] finger, you're not a complete body.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; So even though we might be a finger,
[33:06] God's not complete without you. Right.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; I want to read you something from um
[33:10] that the uh sister uh Esther sent us um
[33:17] said, "Brother Wade, Sister Junior
[33:19] Church family, thank you for the
[33:20] beautiful spray arrangements that was
[33:22] sent for Sharon's funeral. The flowers
[33:24] were beautiful and brought a sense of
[33:26] peace to the room. We appreciate your
[33:28] prayers and all the other things, texts,
[33:31] visits, cards, and support during that
[33:33] time. Meal was wonderful and much
[33:35] appreciated." And Sharon would have
[33:36] said, she would have said no, no, no.
[33:38] She said yes, yes, good, good, good
[33:40] food. So, but your kindness has meant so
[33:43] much to us. Thank you for continued
[33:44] prayers for the family. And that's from
[33:46] the Canada family. So, thank you all for
[33:48] participating in the u um homegoing
[33:52] ceremony for sister Sharon. And uh she's
[33:56] uh
[33:58] she's not walking around with her arm
[34:00] all drawled up. I'll promise you that.
[34:02] No, no, no, no. That ain't the We might
[34:05] That may be the way we leave this world,
[34:06] but that ain't the way we jump over into
[34:08] that other dimension.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; All that stays here.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; We have a new body, but it's inside your
[34:15] body right now. Helping to change you.
[34:18] There's not, you don't have a body over
[34:19] there that's hanging up in a closet
[34:21] waiting on you to go over there. No,
[34:22] this is what's going to carry you there.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Your soul is what's going to carry you
[34:26] to the other dimension. And you are a
[34:29] soul. Amen. So, we know that. Um, I also
[34:32] want to um go ahead and thank the ones
[34:34] that are working downstairs and working
[34:36] at the venue now that are getting things
[34:38] ready for us to have our uh Christmas
[34:41] dinner. Um, I know maybe that um uh
[34:45] there's when we first came in message,
[34:49] you know, Christmas was of the devil.
[34:52] Um
[34:54] that kind of Easter was okay. Um, but
[34:57] then you had uh all the other things
[34:59] were of the devil and you had this and
[35:01] that and all of the devil and TVs were
[35:04] of the devil and somehow that all
[35:07] creeped in cuz I'm not going to ask you
[35:09] to raise your hand if you got a
[35:10] television in your house. Brother said
[35:12] he'd take it out and shoot it. That's
[35:14] what he said. I'm just saying, you know.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:19] But
[35:21] he never denied Christmas.
[35:24] Never did. He preached God's wrapped
[35:26] gift. Why Bethlehem? We have seen his
[35:29] star in the east. And he preached them
[35:31] on Christmas day, the day before, the
[35:34] day after.
[35:35] And he thanked him. And I'm going to
[35:37] read. I think I got one where he thanked
[35:38] everybody for the Christmas presents.
[35:40] Because we're going to talk about the
[35:41] greatest Christmas gift that was ever
[35:43] given.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; And it was wrapped. And you know, you
[35:47] can wrap. We used to to fake people out,
[35:49] our kids out. We would wrap something
[35:51] little in a great big box.
[35:54] make them think they was getting
[35:55] something. Daniel, hey, my kids thought,
[35:58] man, I'm getting it'd be a little old
[35:59] box with a with a ton of toy in it or
[36:01] something. So, unless you open the
[36:04] package,
[36:06] &gt;&gt; you will not know what's inside.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Unless you open the gift, you will not
[36:11] know what's inside. So, I adore you
[36:15] today, all you ones that are that are
[36:17] visiting here, find that gift today.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That gift is Jesus Christ, but
[36:22] it's also the Holy Ghost that he gave is
[36:24] the greatest gift to you and I. And he's
[36:28] not a baby anymore.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; No, he's not a baby anymore. If you'd
[36:32] like to turn to the book of Luke, we'll
[36:34] begin here and uh and start. Um I was um
[36:38] noticing uh Brother Joe Canada when when
[36:41] y'all were singing um you know, I walk
[36:43] around all over and search around all
[36:45] over. I noticed there was no black eyes.
[36:48] There was some elbows slung. They were
[36:50] doing this, Brother Donnie, and there
[36:52] was people leaning around. We kind of
[36:54] got we kind of got a
[36:57] a lot of people in a short uh building.
[37:00] So, I want you to pray with me. Uh we're
[37:03] going to um try to coming up this year
[37:08] expand the church. All right. We're
[37:11] going to try our best. Uh I put a fleece
[37:14] before the Lord um six months ago that
[37:18] if two things would happen
[37:21] that it would be a nod for him to allow
[37:24] us to build on and they both happened.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Um one was quite a miracle.
[37:33] So they both happened though. So we're
[37:35] good. and we're going to try to get
[37:37] together maybe with the the uh trustees
[37:39] and the deacons and and some of you that
[37:42] build and all that and and figure out
[37:44] something to do. We're not going to um
[37:48] fleece the people or borrow any money.
[37:52] All right? We're going to try to do it
[37:54] as the Lord and if it's for the if it's
[37:56] of the Lord, it'll be there. Uh brother
[37:58] Dale did the same thing when he had it
[37:59] on from that door backwards. He said he
[38:02] told somebody, Sister Lisa and one of
[38:04] them said, "Well, when we get the
[38:05] certain amount of money in the bank,
[38:06] we're going to start doing it." Well, by
[38:08] the time we got finished, that certain
[38:09] amount of money was back, wasn't it?
[38:12] That certain amount, whatever we spent,
[38:13] $30, $40,000, by the time they finished
[38:15] it, that money was right back in in. So,
[38:18] you can't out give God. There is no way
[38:20] you can outgive God. No way. If you do
[38:23] it right.
[38:26] And I don't want to do it to have a big
[38:27] church, but I do want it to where uh the
[38:29] sisters don't have to stand in line to
[38:31] use the two bathrooms and and uh y'all
[38:34] don't have to, you know, worship like
[38:36] this, but we'll see what we can do. But
[38:38] just keep it in your prayer. Please pray
[38:40] that um that we'll do it right and uh
[38:44] we'll be looking at all that. So, God
[38:46] bless you. Um we have got stuff coming
[38:49] up with Chris Long and different ones
[38:50] coming in. So, we'll we'll announce that
[38:52] later, but let's bow our heads. Lord,
[38:54] thank you for this day. Thank you for
[38:56] the fellowship that we have, the
[38:57] building that we have. Lord, it's been
[38:59] renovated several times. Lord, we know
[39:02] that it's all because of you. It's not
[39:05] because of a program. As brother Joe
[39:06] said, it's not not a program. It's not
[39:09] We sing better, we do this better, Lord.
[39:12] It's because we want to serve you
[39:13] better. And Lord, we want to hear from
[39:15] you, Lord, and have a comfortable place
[39:18] for the believers to come, Lord, and and
[39:20] worship you in spirit and truth. Father,
[39:23] it's all for you. Nothing for anything
[39:24] else. Lord, we pray that you'd be with
[39:26] us now in the further of this service.
[39:28] Be with the ones that are sick. Sister
[39:30] Anna Canard, different ones, Lord, that
[39:32] are sick now. I pray that you would
[39:33] touch their body. Uh, Brother Danny back
[39:36] there, Lord, with nerve in his shoulder
[39:37] hurting him. Lord, I pray that before
[39:39] this service is over, Lord, that that
[39:41] thing will be healed. Father, because
[39:42] you're you're the one that sent your
[39:43] word and you're the one that healed us.
[39:46] We we love doctors. Doctors are fine,
[39:49] but Lord, there's no doctor on the face
[39:52] of this earth except Dr. Jesus that can
[39:54] put us back together because you're not
[39:56] just a physician. Lord, you're a great
[39:57] physician. And Lord, I depend on you for
[40:00] all those things. Forgive us of our sins
[40:02] and bless us, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen.
[40:05] Luke 2 verse 4. And Joseph also went up
[40:09] from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth
[40:11] into Judea unto the city of David, which
[40:13] is called Bethlehem, because he was of
[40:16] the house and lineage of David, to be
[40:19] taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being
[40:21] great with child. And so it was that
[40:23] while they were there, the days were
[40:25] accomplished that she should be
[40:26] delivered. And she brought forth her
[40:28] firstborn son, and wrapped him in
[40:30] swaddling cloth. Now, we'll talk about
[40:34] this. Brother Ramble will tell you what
[40:35] you know what that is. That is if all we
[40:38] know what horses are, right? Remember,
[40:40] you don't just put a saddle on a horse,
[40:43] you put a blanket down. Well, the oxen
[40:46] back then had a cloth that went around
[40:48] their neck to keep the um the yolk from
[40:52] from rubbing on their skin and it was
[40:55] full of sweat. It smelled like oxen cuz
[40:59] that I'll guarantee you them blankets
[41:02] unless they're clean, they're smelly.
[41:04] But they smell like they smell like what
[41:06] it is. Well, you know what? Jesus was
[41:08] wrapped in swaddling clothes.
[41:11] The only thing they could have that they
[41:13] had to put around him cuz I know all
[41:15] everybody, you know, when our babies are
[41:17] born in the hospital and we love them to
[41:19] death that what's the first thing they
[41:20] do? They wrap them babies up cuz they're
[41:22] freezing. They come out of 98.6 degrees
[41:25] into about a 50 degree degree room, you
[41:27] know. So, you can imagine back then they
[41:30] didn't have all that. This baby was born
[41:32] probably on some straw and they had to
[41:35] clean him up and Joseph was helping and
[41:37] my this was God.
[41:40] But his mama wrapped him up in swaddling
[41:44] clothes and laid him in a manger because
[41:46] there was no room for them in the end.
[41:47] You may be seated. The Lord add his
[41:48] blessing to the reading of the word.
[41:52] In Luke 2:10, it continues on and
[41:56] there's something comes in into the view
[41:58] and that's angels. So the angel said
[42:01] unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I
[42:02] bring you good tidings of great joy,
[42:04] which shall be to all people. For unto
[42:06] you this day, for you is born this day
[42:10] in the city of David, a Savior, which is
[42:12] Christ the Lord." And this shall be a
[42:15] sign. Now, see, there's a sign. This
[42:17] will be a sign unto you. You shall find
[42:18] the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes
[42:22] and lying in a manger. All right? So,
[42:25] when he was born, now we know one
[42:28] thing's for sure. The swaddling cloth
[42:30] was not holy.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; It was something they had. It was
[42:35] something that they used to wrap the
[42:37] baby up with. But the real wrapping on
[42:40] the gift that we were were getting ready
[42:42] to receive, the world was is flesh.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[42:48] &gt;&gt; God chose that. He didn't choose to come
[42:51] an angel that never had a sin or never
[42:52] did anything. We know Jesus didn't sin,
[42:54] but he came under the law. He came to do
[42:57] away with sin, but he had to do it in
[42:59] human flesh because that's where we
[43:01] fell. We fell in human flesh. All right,
[43:03] everybody with me? So, we're going to
[43:06] just go back a little bit. I did some
[43:07] history um on the city of Bethlehem
[43:12] because why wasn't Jesus born in
[43:15] Jerusalem? That was the most holy city
[43:17] in the world at the time. Why wasn't he
[43:20] born in Jericho? Why wasn't he born in
[43:22] in Nazareth?
[43:24] He was born in Bethlehem because of a
[43:27] couple of reasons. And we'll look at
[43:29] these. We know one thing's for sure. The
[43:31] scripture said he was. But how did all
[43:33] this happen with the town of Bethlehem?
[43:37] Micah 5:2 says, "But thou Bethlehem
[43:40] Ephraatha,
[43:42] thou though thou be little among the
[43:44] thousands of Judah, yet out of thee
[43:47] shall he who Christ come forth unto me
[43:51] that is to be the ruler of Israel, whose
[43:53] going forth have been of old from
[43:56] everlasting." So there is your there is
[43:58] your um prophecy that Jesus, the ruler
[44:02] of Israel, is going to come from
[44:03] Bethlehem. Now, looking these things up,
[44:07] I don't have them on the screen. I'll
[44:09] just talk to you in a minute. Uh Joshua,
[44:11] when Joshua divided the land, we got to
[44:14] go back several hundred years. When
[44:16] Joshua divided the land,
[44:19] remember Jesus was the lion of the tribe
[44:22] of Judah. So, he had to come from the
[44:24] lineage of Judah. All right, everybody
[44:27] with me? We know he wasn't physically,
[44:30] but he was told in the scripture that he
[44:32] would come from the tribe of Judah and
[44:36] he would be the lion of the tribe of
[44:37] Judah. So, we know that come through
[44:40] Joseph. But listen, Judah's portion
[44:45] when Joshua went across and divided the
[44:46] land up, Judah's portion was where
[44:49] Bethlehem was located.
[44:52] All right? Not a coincidence because he
[44:55] had to be of the tribe of Judah.
[44:59] What's interesting about Bethlehem is
[45:02] it's a country that where most all of
[45:05] the wheat and barley
[45:07] are produced
[45:10] for for Israel
[45:12] &gt;&gt; back then. Now, not now. Back then,
[45:16] very small town.
[45:19] Interesting that wheat and barley when
[45:21] you cook it, it makes what? Bread. when
[45:24] Jesus said, "I am that bread that come
[45:27] down out of heaven."
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Why, little Bethlehem?
[45:32] So, to get the story completely
[45:34] straight,
[45:37] this is going to be strange.
[45:39] And I don't know if you knew this or
[45:40] not,
[45:42] but Judah's son,
[45:45] Salmon,
[45:47] now, is everybody familiar with Salmon?
[45:50] Not Solomon. Salmon.
[45:53] Salmon is the one that married Rahab,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; the harlot,
[46:01] &gt;&gt; the gentile, the one that was saved by
[46:05] sanctification
[46:07] in that she trusted that the people of
[46:10] Israel served the correct God.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; I hope you get something from this
[46:15] today.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; They were She knew that he was that they
[46:19] were serving the correct God. So she
[46:21] said,
[46:22] "I'll harbor the two fugitives or
[46:26] witnesses, spies,
[46:28] but I want you to save my family." Can
[46:30] we stand up today? Even though being
[46:32] Gentiles as we are, can we say, "God,
[46:35] save our family.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Save our whole family." You said, "Well,
[46:39] I don't know about
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Give it to God.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to figure out how to do it.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Give it to God.
[46:50] Because you know what? Rahab didn't sit
[46:52] there in her house and figure out how it
[46:55] was going to happen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; She didn't know that wall was going to
[46:58] fall. She knew that they were defeated,
[47:00] but she didn't know that wall was going
[47:02] to fall. And when that wall fell,
[47:04] &gt;&gt; her house was built on the side of that
[47:07] wall.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Well, when you want when the Israelites
[47:11] walked into the into the city, it was
[47:13] nothing but rubble except for one tower
[47:15] standing up just like this.
[47:18] And there was a red scarlet rope
[47:27] &gt;&gt; sanctification.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; She had done what she was supposed to
[47:30] do. She did everything God told her to
[47:33] do through the two spies.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; And Joshua spared her life. Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; So here comes Salmon, which was a
[47:41] general. He marries Rahab
[47:45] &gt;&gt; and they founded or co-founded or had a
[47:49] piece of finding the city of Bethlehem.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Now,
[47:56] who was born in that city before Jesus
[47:58] was?
[48:01] Well, when Salomon and Rahab got
[48:03] together, they had a son named Boaz,
[48:07] &gt;&gt; which was half Gentile,
[48:11] &gt;&gt; half Jew, right? And he married a
[48:16] Moabitis woman, another gentile, a
[48:18] Moabitete
[48:20] named Ruth.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; And they had a child named Oed. Now,
[48:24] this is all in in Bethlehem. They had a
[48:28] son named Oed.
[48:30] Oed had a son named Jesse.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Jesse had a son named David.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; And David
[48:41] was going to be the king. And you know
[48:43] what? He was anointed in that city
[48:46] &gt;&gt; out in the field in the outskirts. But
[48:48] he was anointed while they were living
[48:50] in Bethlehem.
[48:52] And then God tells the whole world
[48:54] through the scriptures and through all
[48:56] the the Old Testament that that there
[48:59] would be a son of David would come and
[49:02] would rule the whole world and he would
[49:04] sit on the throne of David and rule for
[49:07] an eternity.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; They didn't know who it was. They just
[49:11] knew there was one coming
[49:13] &gt;&gt; that would rule as David ruled. All this
[49:16] was done in Bethlehem.
[49:19] But now to fulfill another scripture,
[49:24] Jesus
[49:26] was not born in Nazareth.
[49:30] Everybody with me?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; But that's where Joseph and Mary was
[49:34] from.
[49:37] They had to travel to Bethlehem
[49:40] to be taxed.
[49:42] Okay, we just send ours in the mail. But
[49:46] they had to travel
[49:48] to be taxed because he had to be not
[49:53] born in Nazareth, but born in Bethlehem,
[49:56] but he had a Nazer Nazerite vow that he
[50:00] carried from that city back. And when he
[50:03] was born and got up a little bit older,
[50:05] they went back to Nazareth.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; All right. But they had to go to
[50:09] Bethlehem because of all the way back
[50:12] from Joshua dividing the land and Judah
[50:15] got this portion. And to be the line of
[50:16] the tribe of Judah, scripture has to be
[50:19] perfect. It has to be that he is the
[50:22] line of the tribe of Judah coming out of
[50:25] Judah and Judah's lineage.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; But remember one thing, they were not
[50:33] all Israelites.
[50:35] Rahab was a harlot. I hope y'all see
[50:38] this. Rahab was a harlot.
[50:41] What kind of grace was that? That was
[50:44] that sanctification that was hanging out
[50:45] of that rope, hanging that rope off of
[50:47] his off of her uh apartment.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And remember when you look at Rahab,
[50:55] you know Jesus, there was a time when
[50:58] we'll go forward a little bit. There was
[51:01] a time when Jesus was standing somewhere
[51:02] and there was a bunch of Pharisees
[51:04] brought a woman that had been caught in
[51:08] the act of adultery.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Caught
[51:11] by these three men in the act of
[51:13] adultery.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And they brought her to Jesus
[51:17] and said, "Master, we've caught this
[51:20] lady in the very act of adultery." Now,
[51:22] back then, they stoned you and killed
[51:24] you. Both of them, man and woman. We
[51:26] would have a lot less population today
[51:29] if they would do that. But that's how
[51:32] serious it is though. But look at the
[51:33] grace that's involved here because what
[51:36] did Jesus do? Jesus said, "All right,
[51:39] lady. Where's your accuser?" She's right
[51:41] here. There. I mean, you know, they
[51:42] said, "Wait, we saw her do it." He said,
[51:45] "Okay."
[51:46] So, he gets down and he starts writing
[51:49] in the ground uh writing on the ground.
[51:50] And there's all kind of uh theories of
[51:53] what was written down, but
[51:55] I think maybe he was writing and he
[51:57] said, "Uh, okay, Rabbi Jones, you were
[52:00] uh you were seen drinking a lot of
[52:02] alcohol yesterday." And he was writing
[52:04] their life
[52:06] &gt;&gt; in that in that sand. Because as when he
[52:10] got finished writing that sand, he looks
[52:12] up and he says, "Who here without sin
[52:16] can cast the first stone?"
[52:19] Right?
[52:21] &gt;&gt; What was Jesus doing? Cuz Jesus had to
[52:25] be under the law
[52:27] even though he was God.
[52:29] And he had to go by the law, which said
[52:33] if you were caught in the act of
[52:34] adultery, you were to be taken out and
[52:36] stoned.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; All right? That was witnesses. Somebody
[52:40] witnessed that.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; So Jesus knew he'd not seen that happen.
[52:44] I hope somebody gets this right here.
[52:47] Jesus had not seen her commit adultery.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; So he knew
[52:54] being under the law he had to get rid of
[52:57] the witnesses
[53:01] &gt;&gt; cuz he looked up again and all three of
[53:03] them were gone.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lady, where are your
[53:06] accusers?"
[53:09] &gt;&gt; She said, "I have none."
[53:12] In other words, he said, "Sister," he
[53:14] said, "I I've done away with all your
[53:16] fault."
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Remember what did he say? Go and sin no
[53:20] more.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; You're you're good. You're okay. What
[53:23] about grace?
[53:25] &gt;&gt; So, God got rid of her accusers. Now,
[53:27] what happened in in uh when Rahab was on
[53:31] that wall, the wall come down to
[53:33] Jericho, you know, I mean um yeah,
[53:35] Jericho.
[53:37] And to be real honest, she was a
[53:39] prostitute. So she knew many men in the
[53:41] city, if you know what I mean. She was
[53:44] well known cuz she had a cuz she had an
[53:47] apartment on the wall. She wasn't in
[53:49] poverty.
[53:52] But for Salmon to marry a prostitute,
[53:59] that sounds harsh.
[54:01] But what did he do?
[54:04] God said, "You've done so much for me.
[54:06] This is what I'm going to do for you."
[54:07] Because if you'll read your Bible, every
[54:10] man
[54:11] in Jericho was killed.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; God did away with her witnesses.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; God did away with her witnesses so that
[54:28] she could marry. And God himself come
[54:31] through that lineage.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Through that lineage.
[54:38] So when the devil comes to you and says
[54:41] so and so and so and so, just look
[54:43] around and say,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; "I have no accuser for that.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; God saw me righteous."
[54:51] &gt;&gt; He saw me righteous to begin with.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; I know we have problems. We have to ask
[54:56] God to forgive us. But when are we going
[54:57] to start believing that the Bible says
[54:59] we're going to be without spot or
[55:00] wrinkle? Spot or wrinkle. Amen.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; We're not going to have a spot on us.
[55:07] The prophet of God tells us the sinless,
[55:10] perfect
[55:11] &gt;&gt; bride of Jesus Christ.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Now, when we going to start believing
[55:14] that?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz God is getting ready to get rid of
[55:17] our accusers.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; And the greatest accuser is who? The
[55:21] devil.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; So, if you don't have the devil in your
[55:24] soul today, you have got rid of the
[55:26] accuser.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he may play with your body
[55:29] and he may play with your spirit, but
[55:31] he's not going to get your soul. Your
[55:33] soul is going to always believe the word
[55:36] of God.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I just wanted to throw that in
[55:40] there. And now, let's go back to the
[55:41] baby.
[55:43] But, like I said before, you can't know
[55:45] what this package is until you unwrap
[55:46] it. You kind of don't know what it is.
[55:48] You see the wrapping and you see the
[55:50] shape of the box and we get things at
[55:52] the post office and we look at it and
[55:53] go, "I don't know what that is."
[55:57] You'll never know until you unwrap it.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; But now remember,
[56:03] 90% of the time, the one that gives the
[56:06] gift knows what's in it. Are you with
[56:10] me?
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz you wrap it yourself.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what it looks like on the
[56:16] outside. If you wrapped it, you know
[56:18] what's inside. Right?
[56:21] &gt;&gt; So, God knew what was inside when he
[56:24] wrapped that baby 2,000 years ago in
[56:27] human flesh.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; He knew where he was going to be. He
[56:30] knew who he was. He knew he wasn't a
[56:32] second person of a Trinity. He was the
[56:35] person of God himself, manifested as a
[56:38] baby. You say, "I don't believe that."
[56:40] Well, okay. That's your problem to not
[56:44] believe. God said,
[56:47] "I'm going to have a virgin that will
[56:49] conceive and bring forth a child, and
[56:51] his name will be called what?"
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, which is God, not a second
[56:56] person.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; God with us.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown tells us many times that
[57:01] that Jehovah was laying in a cradle
[57:04] crying. Jehovah with no teeth.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Jehovah that couldn't talk at first.
[57:09] Jehovah that fell down probably maybe
[57:11] got a spanking from mom and dad because
[57:13] the Bible said he learned by the things
[57:15] that he suffered cuz he was always human
[57:18] but inside of that humanity was almighty
[57:20] God.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And it grew and it kept growing and it
[57:27] grew some more.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; So we know that Bethlehem the the
[57:32] meaning of Bethlehem Beth Elheam is the
[57:36] house of God's bread. That's why wheat
[57:38] and barley was raised in Bethlehem. And
[57:41] I don't know if it is today, but that
[57:42] was back then. That was the center of
[57:43] the barley and wheat fields. Because
[57:45] remember who owned all that? Boaz owned
[57:47] it at one time. Remember, he owned
[57:49] fields. You couldn't even you can't even
[57:50] count how many fields that Boaz had.
[57:52] That was in Bethlehem
[57:54] &gt;&gt; because of
[57:58] God being the bread of life.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; And Jesus being able to stand and say
[58:03] that that I am the bread that come down
[58:05] out of heaven.
[58:08] So Genesis 49:9
[58:13] here's going to tell us this is where it
[58:15] comes from Judah. Judah is a lion's wel
[58:17] line of the tribe of Judah from the prey
[58:19] my son that thou art gone up he stooped
[58:21] down he couched as a lion as an old lion
[58:24] who shall rouse him up.
[58:27] Now look, the se scepter scepter shall
[58:31] not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver
[58:33] from between his feet until shallow come
[58:38] and unto him shall the gathering of the
[58:39] people be. Now the scepter is the word.
[58:43] If you look up that scepter, it can mean
[58:45] the word. So the word shall not depart
[58:47] from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
[58:49] his feet until shallow. Shallow is where
[58:53] the ark of the covenant landed and that
[58:56] was a sacred place from then on. But
[58:59] Shiloh also means Christ because Christ
[59:02] was in that ark.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; So this is telling us exactly where
[59:07] Jesus is coming from, what lineage he's
[59:09] coming from, and from between his feet.
[59:11] In other words, he's going to be born
[59:14] &gt;&gt; in Bethlehem
[59:16] out of the tribe of Judah.
[59:19] And listen, this person is going to have
[59:22] to be human because
[59:25] the scripture tells us, and this is
[59:26] Moses talking, which is what? Human
[59:29] flesh.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee
[59:33] a prophet from the midst of thee of thy
[59:35] brethren, like unto me. So, he's not
[59:37] coming an angel. He's not coming a
[59:39] priest. He's coming a prophet.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; But he is coming in human flesh.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Unto him you shall hearken. But now
[59:48] remember, why did they not believe him?
[59:53] He came exactly the way the Bible said.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 7:13, he said, "Hear you now, oh
[1:00:01] house of David? Is it a small thing for
[1:00:03] you to weary men? But will you weary my
[1:00:05] God also? Therefore, the Lord himself
[1:00:08] shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin
[1:00:11] shall conceive and bear a son, and shall
[1:00:14] call his name Emmanuel.
[1:00:17] which is interpreted as what?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; God with us. Not a second a person. God
[1:00:21] with us.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:00:24] How can that be?
[1:00:27] That's the only way it could be.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; He could not be born a human man
[1:00:32] fullrown to be our brother.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Melazdc was God Almighty in human flesh.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Melazdc was God Almighty in human flesh.
[1:00:44] The theophony of God was Melazdc. But
[1:00:48] when he met Abraham, he was a fullg
[1:00:50] grown man.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; You and I were not born full grown men
[1:00:54] and women.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We were born babies.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; So that same theophony or that same
[1:01:00] spirit of God had to enter into a flesh
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; and be a baby and come listen come from
[1:01:08] the same place all of us came from.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; We all came from the womb. Everybody
[1:01:13] with me?
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; So, he had to come through the womb to
[1:01:16] be exactly our brother.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; But the world didn't know
[1:01:22] what they were dealing with
[1:01:25] cuz every time he would try to unwrap
[1:01:27] itself.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; The world wrapped him back up.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; It's going to be simple with just a
[1:01:37] Christmas present to you. is the
[1:01:40] greatest gift that's ever been given.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; So that he had to be a human baby. God
[1:01:47] had to be wrapped in human flesh.
[1:01:51] So God's wrapped gift 1225 Christmas day
[1:01:55] 1960. The love of God, how God unfolded
[1:01:59] himself and come a Christmas package
[1:02:03] was laid on straw. The first thing he
[1:02:06] had was to press against his little head
[1:02:08] with straw and a dirty piece of
[1:02:10] swaddling cloth wrapped around him. The
[1:02:13] last thing he had on was a crown of
[1:02:14] thorns with a dirty rag wrapped around
[1:02:16] him and people hitting him on the head.
[1:02:18] Say, "If you're a prophet, tell us who
[1:02:20] hit you."
[1:02:22] God's wrapped gift. Yes, sir.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; He laid on straw soft.
[1:02:29] He died with a crown of thorns on his
[1:02:31] head. But he had to do that. We'll get
[1:02:33] to it just a second. He had to do that
[1:02:35] to reveal himself.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Nobody understood him. Listen, for the
[1:02:40] whole 30 something years he lived,
[1:02:41] nobody understood him. His mama denied
[1:02:43] even the virgin birth.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS THE ONE THAT was there.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Tell me how spirit can get on somebody
[1:02:52] now. Spirit got on her bad.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; She said, "Your father and I have sought
[1:02:56] you diligently." Brother Barham said
[1:02:58] right there, "She denied the virgin
[1:03:00] birth." Well, she's the one that ought
[1:03:01] to know it was a virgin birth.
[1:03:04] How well do we forget as we walk this
[1:03:07] journey of Christianity how we got here?
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; She did.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist did.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Come on. John the Baptist was groomed
[1:03:22] his whole life to introduce one man.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; And when he put him in prison, he sent
[1:03:27] two of his disciples and said, "Are you
[1:03:29] the one or am I going to are they going
[1:03:31] to be another one come?
[1:03:33] How well do we get away sometimes from
[1:03:36] our walk of Christianity because we've
[1:03:38] been in it for a long period of time?
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; We should today take oursel and examine
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; what's going on in our life to realize
[1:03:46] we have not went away from God. We've
[1:03:48] got closer to God.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; We know who he is. We know where he's
[1:03:52] at.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; We know he's coming. We know he's
[1:03:55] already come in certain in in in in
[1:03:58] flesh yours and mine. And
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; we'll get to that in a minute. We want
[1:04:01] to give you a real good Christmas gift
[1:04:03] here in just a minute. It won't be very
[1:04:05] long.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know when we eating down there,
[1:04:07] but we can go down fellowship.
[1:04:11] Love reached out when his own children
[1:04:12] cried for his blood and he screamed,
[1:04:14] "Father, forgive them. They don't know
[1:04:15] what they're doing." That's love. The
[1:04:18] church don't want that.
[1:04:20] They want creed. We need love. The
[1:04:23] church is dying by creeds. It can only
[1:04:26] live by love because love is eternal.
[1:04:29] Love overcomes all things. Love's the
[1:04:31] most powerful force
[1:04:34] there is.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; How about somebody take and beat you to
[1:04:40] a pulp and you still forgive them
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; and say I love you and mean it.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; That's what that is.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; The capstone comes with love
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; because with love there's grace.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. without without the love of
[1:04:58] God for Rahab, she would have fell with
[1:05:00] the rest of them because I'm sure she's
[1:05:01] not the only harlot that was in Jericho.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; But God knew in her heart before the
[1:05:07] foundation of the world that some two he
[1:05:09] sent two spies that she would say,
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; "I'll do it.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I'll But you but" but what was her
[1:05:15] greatest thing? She said, "I'll do it,
[1:05:18] but you got to protect my family."
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Remember he told then the two spies when
[1:05:23] they came up, they told her they said,
[1:05:24] "You get in your house." Uh-huh.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; You get in your house and let that
[1:05:29] scarlet rope down
[1:05:32] and we won't bother you or your house.
[1:05:35] How can we do now as we as Christians
[1:05:37] today? We need to place the blood back
[1:05:40] on our children again, back on our
[1:05:42] husbands and our wives and even on
[1:05:44] oursel
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; to see that there's something there's a
[1:05:47] blood atonement for our sins and for our
[1:05:51] sanctification
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; that we had died daily though but we
[1:05:54] have a sanctifying blood that gives a
[1:05:57] sanctifying life.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:06:03] Hebrews 10:5, "Wherefore when he cometh
[1:06:06] into the world, he saith sacrifice and
[1:06:08] offerings thou wouldest not." In other
[1:06:10] words, it was lamb after lamb, dove
[1:06:12] after dove, uh ox after ox. I mean, they
[1:06:15] were millions of sacrifices were made
[1:06:19] during Solomon's time and all the
[1:06:20] different ones and and Moses.
[1:06:24] But God really only wanted one thing. He
[1:06:27] wanted a body that he could live in
[1:06:31] that was prepared by God himself.
[1:06:35] Don't you think that the devil wanted to
[1:06:37] kill Jesus every chance he could?
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; He could feel that spirit. He knew that
[1:06:41] there was something different about that
[1:06:42] kid.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And listen, let me tell you something.
[1:06:45] You say, "Well, that was for Jesus
[1:06:47] only." No, let me tell you something.
[1:06:48] There's one difference between you and
[1:06:50] the Lord.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; He was born with eternal life.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; You were not.
[1:06:56] I don't care what anybody in the message
[1:06:58] says.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; You were not born eternal.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; You were born dead
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; and had to have this new birth
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; because your first birth wasn't worth
[1:07:10] it.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; But remember, Jesus's first birth was
[1:07:13] had it should have been had they not
[1:07:15] been a fall.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:14 says he was the
[1:07:20] beginning of the creation of God.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED TO CREATE ALL OF US. HE HAD
[1:07:24] us in his mind. And he was going to
[1:07:25] bring us in flesh. He was going to bring
[1:07:27] us through Adam and Eve. Every how you
[1:07:28] want to say it. But it had to be spoken.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; NOT AN ACT OF SEX.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; SO, how was he going to come and cleanse
[1:07:36] it? He was going to come without an act
[1:07:39] of sex.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; As a virgin shall conceive. And God
[1:07:43] created in her womb both egg and sperm.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; So, he was not Jew or Gentile. Not Not
[1:07:50] physically.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, spiritually he came from
[1:07:54] the tribe of Judah. Spiritually that was
[1:07:56] through Joseph. But Joseph had nothing
[1:07:58] to do with that birth.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Mary had nothing to do with that birth.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; It was a creation of God. And I believe
[1:08:07] he took the egg and the sperm from his
[1:08:09] mind.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Where'd you come from?
[1:08:19] But because of the fall, you had to come
[1:08:21] by mom and daddy.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; But in the mind of God, when you get
[1:08:24] born again, brother Bram said, it's a
[1:08:26] what? It's an act. It's an act of
[1:08:29] conception. That should have been that
[1:08:32] way had there not been a fall. That's
[1:08:34] why you have to have a new birth.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Your first birth will kill you.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; But a body hast thou prepared me? Now,
[1:08:42] we say that was Jesus, and that's fine
[1:08:44] and dandy. But listen, if you're a born
[1:08:46] again Christian today, if you have the
[1:08:48] the word of God, the eternal life in
[1:08:50] your soul, he has prepared your body,
[1:08:53] too.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Right now, today,
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; what are we missing? Are we waiting for
[1:09:04] something else to happen? No. We need a
[1:09:07] Christmas every day of of our life. We
[1:09:10] need a continual opening of the word of
[1:09:12] God
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; to see that the gift is always there
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; but a body.
[1:09:21] John 1:1 in the beginning was the word.
[1:09:23] The word was with God and the word was
[1:09:24] God. Verse 14. And the word was wrapped
[1:09:29] or made flesh and dwelt among us. And we
[1:09:32] beheld his glory. We saw him.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Peter, ONE OF THEM SAID, WE TOUCHED HIM.
[1:09:36] WE TALKED TO HIM. THEY ATE WITH HIM.
[1:09:37] THEY SLEPT WITH HIM.
[1:09:39] BUT DID THEY UNDERSTAND HIM? NO.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; They only stood they understood a piece
[1:09:45] of it because when Peter said, "Thou
[1:09:47] only have the words of eternal life.
[1:09:48] Where else could we go?" There was
[1:09:50] something about the man that they loved.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And it was a connection from the
[1:09:55] foundation of the world. God put all
[1:09:57] them in the in the place that they were
[1:09:59] in even Judas.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; To perform his part. All right. So the
[1:10:06] word was wrapped or made flesh. So the
[1:10:10] greatest gift that came was not
[1:10:16] the creation of the world.
[1:10:19] It was the creation of you.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter
[1:10:28] how you get here
[1:10:30] is how you get out of here.
[1:10:33] Because we know for a fact everybody in
[1:10:36] this world was born the same way
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; except one person.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; And when we get into that person,
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; he's took the first birth away and give
[1:10:49] us a new birth.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; As the song says, give them second
[1:10:54] birth. I was thinking about the uh if
[1:10:56] you look on uh song books, we don't use
[1:10:58] them anymore. That's our song book. But
[1:11:00] if you look in the song books, there was
[1:11:02] probably I think there was 200 and
[1:11:03] something songs written by Charles
[1:11:05] Wesley and they were a lot of them were
[1:11:08] Christmas songs.
[1:11:09] So that all came right I mean there was
[1:11:12] a bunch. If you'll look in the in the
[1:11:13] red book you'll see who wrote it right
[1:11:15] on the top and it'll say Charles Wesley
[1:11:17] or somebody like that. They wrote these
[1:11:20] so that we can sing them now and they
[1:11:21] still mean something now as much as they
[1:11:23] meant something back then.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; So everybody with me?
[1:11:29] So today in the end time,
[1:11:33] let's just say back for three and a half
[1:11:35] years when he was on earth,
[1:11:38] as I said before, he tried to unwrap
[1:11:39] himself. He tried to tell the world who
[1:11:41] he was. He tried to tell him, "I am the
[1:11:45] bread of life. I am this. I am that. I
[1:11:48] am the son of God."
[1:11:51] Remember, he didn't say that. They said
[1:11:53] he was. He said he was the son of man.
[1:11:54] He's trying to get them to see that.
[1:11:57] But what happened? The religious world
[1:12:00] rejected the gift because they couldn't
[1:12:03] get past the wrapping.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; One more time. They couldn't get past
[1:12:10] the wrapping.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; The wrapping was flesh.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; But he came the exact Listen, he
[1:12:17] couldn't have been Jesus Christ if he
[1:12:19] came any other way than the word.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; He couldn't be Almighty God if he if he
[1:12:23] came contrary to his word. But they were
[1:12:25] so blinded to what they did was is they
[1:12:27] wrapped him back up in their creed.
[1:12:30] Brother Brown, I'm going to read it here
[1:12:31] in just a minute. He wrapped
[1:12:32] denominations wrapped him up in their
[1:12:34] wrapping paper
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; and they kept him wrapped up.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; But only in the end time, folks, have we
[1:12:41] come to a place to where the real
[1:12:43] wrapping paper has been tore off
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; and we see the unveiled God.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; That now he's not just a baby anymore.
[1:12:53] He's in me and you.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; You and I are the recipient
[1:12:59] of that gift.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Which was what? Eternal life. The Jews
[1:13:05] answered and said, "For a good work we
[1:13:07] stoned thee not." Oh, they loved him
[1:13:08] when he fed him and healed him. But for
[1:13:10] blasphemy, because thou thou being a
[1:13:13] man, makest thyself God.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; No, we know what that statement. We flip
[1:13:18] it around. He was really God making
[1:13:21] himself a man.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; They couldn't see the wrapping. Listen,
[1:13:26] if they couldn't see the wrapping then,
[1:13:28] how they going to see the rapping today?
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Now, the only thing you can do is you
[1:13:33] can This is your This is your
[1:13:36] wrapping paper
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; cuz they're not going to really see the
[1:13:40] true gift inside of you because it's
[1:13:42] eternal life.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; All right. But they're going to see what
[1:13:45] you walk around in. That's why our
[1:13:48] sisters, as our brother said, our
[1:13:49] sisters, we dress the way we dress. Men,
[1:13:52] we act the way we act because that's the
[1:13:55] new rapper that we have.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; When the real gift got put inside of our
[1:14:02] soul,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; cuz what do we live before that? We
[1:14:06] lived the gift that was given when we
[1:14:08] were born.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Regular life and an old Adamic nature.
[1:14:13] Yes, sir.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; That we hated God.
[1:14:17] Oh, come on.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; If you don't love him, you hate him.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; All right, listen to this.
[1:14:30] Brother Brown will tell us in a minute.
[1:14:31] I if I get a chance to read it
[1:14:35] that the creed did wrap him back up. So,
[1:14:38] what are they doing now? Listen, they
[1:14:40] want Jesus,
[1:14:42] but they want him with their wrapping
[1:14:44] paper on him.
[1:14:46] Right. They want to be able to talk the
[1:14:49] way they want to,
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; dress the way they want to,
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; do what they want to put their own
[1:14:57] wrapping on Jesus Christ. But what does
[1:14:59] that do? That binds him
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; from doing what he's doing in our life
[1:15:05] because we know we are now the wrapping
[1:15:07] paper of Jesus Christ
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; because he's inside of us
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; and now you've become the wrapper. But
[1:15:14] remember, Brother Brown tells us right
[1:15:16] at the end of time that God's going to
[1:15:18] unveil his true bride.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And what is unveil? When you go and open
[1:15:25] your gifts on Christmas or whenever it
[1:15:27] is today, you're going to unveil what's
[1:15:31] inside of that box.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; But you got to tear the wrapper off
[1:15:34] first.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? Our
[1:15:40] package today
[1:15:44] is the seals being broke
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; to show who he is.
[1:15:51] Now I believe that brother Brandham,
[1:15:55] what do you do? He showed us where
[1:15:58] Christ was.
[1:16:00] He showed us where Christ was. Christ
[1:16:03] was in the people.
[1:16:05] Not just one person anymore. He was in a
[1:16:08] many membered body.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; The man himself,
[1:16:14] the gift,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; not a second person.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; The gift of God is eternal life through
[1:16:21] Jesus Christ.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And that gift has got to be what?
[1:16:24] Received.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; It's not a gift. If it's not received,
[1:16:28] you can lay a gift over here and it can
[1:16:30] be from me. If I don't pick it up, it'll
[1:16:31] just sit there the whole time.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; But we must receive the gift.
[1:16:37] But at Calvary, he was unveiled.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; At Calvary, the wrapper was torn off.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. There's one thing for
[1:16:46] sure. He didn't have on a loin cloth
[1:16:48] when he was hanging on Calvary.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; He was naked.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz they shamed him to the greatest
[1:16:54] shame that they could be shamed, and
[1:16:56] that was being hung on a cross naked.
[1:17:03] He tried to tell them
[1:17:05] he was hanging there unveiled.
[1:17:09] And what's the first thing they did was
[1:17:10] they wrapped him in a cloth and put him
[1:17:12] in a tomb.
[1:17:15] Come on. That's why told brother Manueli
[1:17:18] preached my sermon part of it.
[1:17:20] Now when Joseph, this is Joseph of Arma,
[1:17:24] took the body, he wrapped it in a clean
[1:17:26] linen cloth. Now that word clean linen
[1:17:28] cloth is like he said that was a special
[1:17:31] silk cloth that had never been put on
[1:17:33] anything.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Now when he was born
[1:17:37] the linen cloth that he was wrapped in
[1:17:40] smell like an ox
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; sweat.
[1:17:43] But when they put him in here they put a
[1:17:45] clean linen cloth on him
[1:17:48] and laid it in his own new tomb which he
[1:17:51] had heuned in the rock. And he rolled a
[1:17:52] great stone to the door of the septic
[1:17:54] and departed. They thought he was
[1:17:56] finished.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; They thought he was the package that was
[1:18:00] going to deliver them
[1:18:02] from the Romans. They thought he was the
[1:18:05] guy that was going to deliver them.
[1:18:08] He delivered them, but he delivered them
[1:18:11] the way he wanted to deliver them.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And today, you will only get deliverance
[1:18:16] the way God wants you to get
[1:18:17] deliverance, not the way you want to get
[1:18:18] deliverance.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the problem with the world
[1:18:21] now. They say, "Come as you are."
[1:18:23] Listen, I say today, come as you are.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; But don't stay as you are.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You can't keep coming as you are. Every
[1:18:35] service, you got to change somewhere
[1:18:37] because what's going to happen is you're
[1:18:39] going to come in and you're going to get
[1:18:41] that gift.
[1:18:43] Somebody in the pull pit is going to
[1:18:45] unwrap him for you.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; All of us.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; All the ministry is that's what we're
[1:18:52] doing. We're unwrapping the gift that
[1:18:53] God give you.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; But you can receive it or not receive
[1:18:57] it.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It's up to you.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Or you can reject it completely
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; and not ever want it.
[1:19:08] So listen, let's go on down. So it is
[1:19:11] today when this great gift of the
[1:19:13] church, the Holy Spirit falls upon the
[1:19:15] poor and humble, the rich don't want it.
[1:19:18] They don't want humble to humble
[1:19:20] themselves. They want it with class, but
[1:19:23] they don't want it the way God sends it.
[1:19:25] That's what I mean. Come as you are. Sit
[1:19:26] under the fountain enough. Let God work
[1:19:29] on you.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; You'll either come in or leave.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; But you're not going to stay the way you
[1:19:34] are.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, you've come up to something
[1:19:38] eternal. You've not come up to some
[1:19:40] department store where you go in and buy
[1:19:42] what you want.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; You're in the house of God.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That's where God resides.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. Sir,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; at the moment, he's just packed himself
[1:19:51] in here for a little while.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Then when we disperse, God's going to
[1:19:55] disperse with you.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; We'll show you something in just a
[1:19:58] second, then we'll be done. They didn't
[1:20:00] want to humble themselves. They want it
[1:20:02] with class, but they don't want it the
[1:20:03] way God sends it. Many people want to
[1:20:06] receive the Holy Ghost, but they want to
[1:20:09] get it in the way they want it. Cuz what
[1:20:13] happened to the Pharisees? They wanted
[1:20:16] the deliverer. They were looking for a
[1:20:18] Messiah. They wanted him because they
[1:20:20] were under depression and and they were
[1:20:22] under suppression. They wanted their
[1:20:25] deliverer to deliver Israel.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; God sent him right there the way he was
[1:20:30] supposed to send him and they didn't
[1:20:32] want it
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; cuz he would have tore up all of their
[1:20:35] creeds and all of their things that they
[1:20:38] did
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; that were wrong.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; All right. But they want to get it the
[1:20:42] way they want it. But oh, I'm so glad
[1:20:44] that you can't do it that way. You have
[1:20:47] to do it the way God sends it to you.
[1:20:49] God sent the gift the way God wanted it
[1:20:52] sent. I don't think of any other way
[1:20:54] than God being a baby laying in a manger
[1:20:56] with poopy diapers.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; You say you're that's exactly WHAT
[1:21:04] HAPPENED. HE WAS SO MUCH HUMAN.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; And I and I'll promise you folks, let
[1:21:10] let me give you this warning. If you see
[1:21:13] those pictures that has this little glow
[1:21:15] around his head,
[1:21:17] even as a baby, see if he if he would
[1:21:20] have come that way and and sister Anna,
[1:21:22] if he would have stepped out and he's
[1:21:23] like kind of like your shirt.
[1:21:27] Come up here. Come here.
[1:21:32] That's flashy right there.
[1:21:35] Sorry though. God didn't come that way.
[1:21:36] You sit right there.
[1:21:40] God came with no clothes. He left the
[1:21:42] world with no clothes. He got came in
[1:21:44] the world with no clothes.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WANTED THE FLASHY.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO TAKE it the way God sends it
[1:21:50] to you and humble ourselves to receive
[1:21:52] it.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT GOD WOULD I mean the
[1:21:57] people if he would have walked into I
[1:21:59] couldn't even see this happening. He w
[1:22:01] he listen Jesus went to the temple.
[1:22:05] Hello somebody. I read you the scripture
[1:22:06] the other day. God went to church.
[1:22:12] every Sabbath,
[1:22:13] every time they had a feast day, he was
[1:22:16] in church.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; So God went to church. Okay, you ought
[1:22:19] to try that sometime.
[1:22:22] But if he would have walked in and they
[1:22:23] would have been this glow,
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:27] you know, they would have said, "Oh,
[1:22:29] that's got to be God.
[1:22:31] Look at that thing around his head.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Look at them eyes. You know, they got
[1:22:35] fire coming out of them."
[1:22:38] There will be
[1:22:40] But you won't want to see it.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; But he came so humble.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; They walked in. He walked in on that
[1:22:49] eighth day and to be circumcised. And
[1:22:52] they're like,
[1:22:55] "That ain't God. He He's coming to be
[1:22:58] circumcised. That can't be. That baby
[1:23:00] can't be God. But he came the way he WAS
[1:23:02] SUPPOSED TO COME.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Have we missed him? THE WAY HE WAS
[1:23:06] SUPPOSED TO COME IN the end time.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Let's fast forward a little bit.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "No, it wasn't
[1:23:14] wrapped right. It wasn't wrapped the
[1:23:16] classical paper around it. It was a
[1:23:19] wrapped as a gift as a gift from God
[1:23:21] sent from God. A God that they didn't
[1:23:23] know nothing about. They claimed they
[1:23:27] did. They claimed they was looking for
[1:23:29] him, but he did not come in the way that
[1:23:31] they thought he was coming according to
[1:23:32] their creeds. and they could not receive
[1:23:35] God's gift. He was wrapped different. He
[1:23:39] was wrapped up like a baby. He was born
[1:23:41] in a manger. He came from poor people.
[1:23:44] He came from a bunch of fanatics. So,
[1:23:47] how could they receive something like
[1:23:48] that? No wonder there was no room for
[1:23:50] him in the end. There's no room for him
[1:23:54] yet in the church. They ousted him.
[1:23:56] Remember, I stand at the door and knock.
[1:23:58] Brother Ram said that was sad. had the
[1:24:00] saddest thing you'd ever seen in our
[1:24:02] church age was Christ standing at the
[1:24:04] door knocking cuz there's no door knob
[1:24:06] on the outside. The doororknob's on the
[1:24:08] inside. You got to let him in.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; They ousted him. They don't believe in
[1:24:12] it. They'll say away with such a thing.
[1:24:14] It's fanaticism.
[1:24:16] We want nothing to do with it. It's
[1:24:18] against our father's doctrine. Yeah. The
[1:24:21] doctrine of the church, the doctrine of
[1:24:24] our creeds of our forefathers.
[1:24:25] Therefore, Christ is just as rejected
[1:24:27] today as he was back then. There's no
[1:24:29] room tonight in our good churches.
[1:24:31] There's no room in our religious circles
[1:24:33] today for a Holy Ghost meeting. They
[1:24:35] don't want it. It belittles them in the
[1:24:37] sight of the classes of the country. It
[1:24:39] belittles them to think that they'd
[1:24:41] humble themselves, to come down to an
[1:24:43] altar to cry and tar there until they're
[1:24:46] filled with the power from on high. To
[1:24:48] rise up from there with newness of life,
[1:24:50] to let women let their hair grow out,
[1:24:52] act like women ought to act. to make men
[1:24:55] throw away their cigarettes and quit
[1:24:57] their drinking and treat their families
[1:24:58] right. It's too much for them. So, they
[1:25:00] hold on to the creed of their church
[1:25:02] instead of receiving God's gift, God's
[1:25:05] Christmas gift. They'd rather have a
[1:25:07] creed than they would the gift. They'd
[1:25:09] rather have the paper than the gift.
[1:25:13] They want the paper. Sure, something's
[1:25:15] all tensed. A lot of fuss they can do
[1:25:17] about it, but the real gift that's on
[1:25:20] the inside, they don't want it.
[1:25:23] He was wrapped in a dirty cloth, a
[1:25:25] swaddling cloth, and he's wrapped today
[1:25:27] in the same thing which they call holy
[1:25:29] roller, fanaticism, bunch of heretics.
[1:25:31] It's wrapped up in swaddling cloth, and
[1:25:34] the world don't want it. Oh, I'm so glad
[1:25:37] to raise that cloth off and look what's
[1:25:39] laying underneath it. Eternal life. God
[1:25:42] made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question. Get
[1:25:51] ready to close. I want to ask you a
[1:25:53] question.
[1:25:56] When they saw, and we'll read it here in
[1:25:58] a minute, when they saw, this just came
[1:26:00] to me the other day. I was studying a
[1:26:02] little bit. Now, we know one thing's for
[1:26:05] sure
[1:26:07] that that William Brham is not God.
[1:26:10] William Brandom is not Jesus.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Close, but he was still born in sin. He
[1:26:17] still made mistakes. He lied.
[1:26:21] One more time.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Okay, he lied
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; cuz he was born one.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he had the Holy Ghost."
[1:26:29] Well, he still had a human. He still had
[1:26:30] some rapper left.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; His wrapping was what was causing him to
[1:26:34] do that. Our wrapping is what causes us
[1:26:36] to do the things we do.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. But we're going to have to do, as
[1:26:41] I've always said, let that gift that you
[1:26:42] got out,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; let it work out into your next realm and
[1:26:46] and uh suppress all these things that
[1:26:49] we're that we're worrying with or or or
[1:26:51] you know, worried about like brother
[1:26:54] Brandon was. But remember, he was not
[1:26:55] God. But now remember, he brought
[1:26:57] something to me and you in the end time
[1:27:00] greater than had ever been brought since
[1:27:03] Jesus Christ came.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:27:09] He brought us a way to get out of here
[1:27:12] in human flesh without death.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; That's what the me the message is not
[1:27:18] the signs and the wonders. I read you
[1:27:20] that and somebody else one of the
[1:27:22] brothers Wednesday night read it. It's
[1:27:23] not it's not when he started out. It's
[1:27:26] not in the healing campaign. Not in the
[1:27:28] prayer lines. That's good. That's
[1:27:29] wonderful. That's great. Listen, that's
[1:27:31] part of the gift. Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; But what did the denominations do? As
[1:27:38] soon as Brother Ram left, they wrapped
[1:27:39] all of it back into their own rapper
[1:27:40] again.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; But there's a group of people that knows
[1:27:45] where God is.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And know where God is and doing what
[1:27:50] he's doing through
[1:27:52] that gift through the wrapping paper
[1:27:54] that he was born with.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; We're talking about flesh.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:01] Now hang on a second. So now let's let's
[1:28:04] look at what happened
[1:28:06] right here.
[1:28:15] What happened
[1:28:18] on the day Jesus was born?
[1:28:21] On the day Jesus was born, number one,
[1:28:25] that star just didn't appear the day he
[1:28:27] was born. Everybody with me? the star,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; the star did not appear the day he was
[1:28:33] born because the magi had to come all
[1:28:35] the way from India or wherever they were
[1:28:37] from and they had to follow that star
[1:28:40] all the way and the Bible tells us by
[1:28:42] the time they got there he was a child
[1:28:44] not a baby.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; So it had to be a length a journey and
[1:28:50] remember that was a constellation
[1:28:53] of stars.
[1:28:56] Anybody
[1:28:58] else looking from another direction
[1:29:02] would see three.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; I say one more time. Anybody looking in
[1:29:09] another direction
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; would see three.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; But what happened when this what
[1:29:15] happened when these do this? How many
[1:29:17] you see?
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; You see one.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; They followed that one star because he
[1:29:22] was one God.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:26] Amen.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Then what happened
[1:29:30] when he was born?
[1:29:33] The magi were still out there traveling,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; but there was a group of
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; There's a group of shepherds
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; that was out there with THEIR FLOCK,
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; GETTING A sermon for the next Sunday.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; AND THEY DIDN'T JUST SEE ONE STAR.
[1:29:54] They saw angels,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; heavenly host,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; a constellation
[1:30:02] of angels
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; singing and praising God. That's what
[1:30:06] the shepherd saw.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; now. Wasn't the great star. The great
[1:30:10] star still there.
[1:30:13] Are you with me? Just for a minute. Wake
[1:30:14] up. We'll go down there and unwrap some
[1:30:16] gifts and y'all be all happy and run
[1:30:18] around all over the place.
[1:30:20] eat cake and drink coffee and go back to
[1:30:22] sleep.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; But the magi was traveling to go see
[1:30:27] Jesus, right?
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; They had a lineup of stars that they
[1:30:31] were following, but it was one big star.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; He is father, son, holy ghost.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; But he's one.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; But when he was born, there was
[1:30:42] shepherds out in the field. Shepherds
[1:30:44] typing what? Ministers
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; out in the field. and they look up and
[1:30:48] they see this heavenly host. It's not
[1:30:51] stars, it's it's angels,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; but you can call them stars cuz they are
[1:30:56] stars. I'll read you out here in a few
[1:30:58] minutes. Jesus called the messengers
[1:31:01] stars.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Seven stars.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; So they saw stars,
[1:31:08] messengers bringing a message and they
[1:31:11] went to see the baby
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; and rejoiced.
[1:31:18] Everybody with me
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; now? Listen.
[1:31:25] What did that show them? That showed
[1:31:26] them where Jesus was. All right,
[1:31:29] everybody with me? That showed them
[1:31:30] where Jesus was at. Okay,
[1:31:35] three magi,
[1:31:37] they come later on. But look what
[1:31:39] happened
[1:31:42] when they looked outside. Now watch.
[1:31:45] There was an happening
[1:31:48] several years ago
[1:31:51] back in the 60s, 1963.
[1:31:54] I was thinking about this the other day.
[1:31:58] You know, there's one God,
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; but there's many stars.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's constellation of stars. A
[1:32:07] constellation is a group of stars that
[1:32:09] show you something.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; All right. a group of stars showing you
[1:32:17] something, a shape, a form,
[1:32:20] bringing you a message.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Because when we look up, we see um
[1:32:25] there's like seven or eight, there's
[1:32:26] like 88 of them, but there's seven major
[1:32:28] ones. Ursula Minor and you know, the
[1:32:31] Orion's belt and all the all the all the
[1:32:34] cancer and all that. That's all in the
[1:32:35] stars
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; and it's been there forever.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Doesn't change.
[1:32:41] But there was a special group
[1:32:44] that came to a prophet in 1963
[1:32:49] of angels.
[1:32:52] And we know that according to Revelation
[1:32:54] 10:7, the mighty angel has to come back
[1:32:58] down here.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; They lost him in the church ages,
[1:33:05] Brother Bram said. In other words, they
[1:33:07] wrapped him back up in their creeds.
[1:33:11] But he's got to be unveiled. Just as
[1:33:13] when they put him in that tomb and they
[1:33:16] wrapped him up,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; they rolled the stone. Did that bother
[1:33:21] him at all?
[1:33:23] When he came up out of paradise, he
[1:33:25] picked that body up. He laid them
[1:33:28] clothes. He folded them up and laid them
[1:33:29] down. And he just swiped the tomb out
[1:33:31] like the the thing over there and walked
[1:33:33] out.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; All right. That was the God.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. That was the God that was supposed
[1:33:39] to been unveiled.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; It took a death, a burial, and a resurre
[1:33:45] I hope somebody gets this. A death, a
[1:33:47] burial, and a resurrection to show who
[1:33:49] he really was.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; He stood there and said, "Heaven and
[1:33:53] earth, EVERYTHING. I HAVE POWER OVER
[1:33:55] THIS WHOLE I GOT POWER OVER THIS GUY
[1:33:57] RIGHT HERE."
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. POWER
[1:34:00] OVER THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. AMEN.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID that when he came out of THE
[1:34:04] TOMB, WELL, THAT SAME PERSON that was
[1:34:05] sitting in a tomb or come out of the
[1:34:07] tomb walking
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; is inside of you today.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And he's not like Lazarus as somebody
[1:34:15] was preaching the other day. Lazarus was
[1:34:17] resurrected and they had he had to have
[1:34:19] the grave clothes took off of him
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; cuz he was still bound.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't walk out still bound,
[1:34:28] folks.
[1:34:29] No, he was alive and well.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; He was in his glorified body the way he
[1:34:34] should have been, the way you should
[1:34:36] have been had it not been a fall.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. That's what we're
[1:34:40] heading toward. You will never take a
[1:34:42] body change unless you see that your
[1:34:43] glorified body
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; is being changed by what's inside of
[1:34:47] you,
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; BY THAT GIFT
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU. It's going to
[1:34:51] change your wrapping paper.
[1:34:55] Now, a few about three years ago, it
[1:34:57] will be now that at home at my home
[1:35:00] church, the Holy Spirit spoke to me and
[1:35:02] says, "Go to Tucson. There's something
[1:35:04] waiting." I stood on this platform and
[1:35:07] told every one of you, "Thus sayeth the
[1:35:09] Lord, something's fixing to happen.
[1:35:11] There's probably hundreds of people
[1:35:13] sitting here that know it. I just told
[1:35:15] you what I saw." The message is on tape.
[1:35:17] What time is it, sir? I saw a
[1:35:19] constellation
[1:35:22] of angels.
[1:35:25] Okay.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Now, if the magi saw one,
[1:35:30] but you got all the all the other the
[1:35:32] way that the way it come was Jesus had
[1:35:34] to come first, right? Everybody with me
[1:35:36] real quick.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus came. He was the head priest, the
[1:35:40] head prophet, the head minister.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Everything comes from him.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; All right. But what did he do to show
[1:35:48] that he was on earth and that he would
[1:35:50] be IN A MANY MEMBERED BODY? HE HAD MANY
[1:35:53] SHEPHERDS
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; LAYING OUT IN THE FIELD.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; HE HAD MANY ANGELS. A CONSTELLATION of
[1:36:00] angels CAME DOWN AND IDENTIFIED WHO IT
[1:36:03] was
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; for you today in this city
[1:36:08] of David is born a SAVIOR WHICH IS
[1:36:11] CHRIST THE LORD.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT WHAT THE MESSENGERS DO TODAY?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; WE POINT YOU TO CHRIST. WE DON'T POINT
[1:36:17] YOU TO SOMEBODY ELSE. YEAH.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; SO NOW WE SEE THAT IT DOESN'T JUST COME
[1:36:23] FROM ONE PERSON. IT'S A MANY MEMBERED
[1:36:24] BODY. It's a five-fold ministry. It's a
[1:36:27] ministry around the world that's trying
[1:36:29] to bring the people together.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; So brother Brown saw a constellation of
[1:36:33] angels like a pyramid. What I tell you a
[1:36:37] constellation did
[1:36:39] it showed you a shape
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; to sometimes show you where you're
[1:36:42] going.
[1:36:50] I'm not saying that we've had a baby
[1:36:52] Jesus come back. Baby Jesus ain't baby
[1:36:55] Jesus no more.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; He's a full grown man.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; But I believe that full grown man called
[1:37:01] the son of man is the one that's got to
[1:37:03] be on this earth today.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; He's got to be here today
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; to change us.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; He's got to be here.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And what happened? He he saw a
[1:37:15] constellation of angels like a pyramid
[1:37:17] come down just north of Tucson up in
[1:37:19] this way north of Tucson and they spoke
[1:37:21] to me something and I didn't know what
[1:37:23] it was and one day there's a man sitting
[1:37:25] right present now two of them that was
[1:37:27] with me back there when that happened
[1:37:29] and they took the picture of it in the
[1:37:31] sky now we know it was that picture
[1:37:32] right there all right because it
[1:37:35] unveiled Christ to the world all right
[1:37:39] in the magazine I thought I had a copy
[1:37:41] but I do that's but that's what it is
[1:37:43] you see it here in Life magazine. This
[1:37:45] copy exactly the way the Holy Spirit
[1:37:46] said it would be. And there stood those
[1:37:49] seven angels
[1:37:51] just as natural as you see me standing
[1:37:54] here and told me to return to my home
[1:37:57] that the mysteries that the reformers
[1:37:58] down through the ages had failed to pick
[1:38:01] up the mysteries of the Bi Bible, which
[1:38:04] is the seven seals.
[1:38:06] Now, what does a seal do? We're going to
[1:38:08] go downstairs or you going to go. We're
[1:38:10] going to go and we're going to look at a
[1:38:11] bunch of sealed packages.
[1:38:17] and we're going to unseal them
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; to see what's inside.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; If not, you don't get the gift. You
[1:38:24] don't get the benefit of the gift.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; The se seven seals held would be
[1:38:32] revealed. I challenge anybody, get those
[1:38:34] seven seals and look them over and find
[1:38:36] a fault with them because it's given by
[1:38:38] inspiration of God. And if you don't
[1:38:40] believe that those stars are angels,
[1:38:42] read Revelations 1:20.
[1:38:45] The mystery of the seven stars, which
[1:38:47] thou sawest in my right hand, and the
[1:38:48] seven golden candlesticks. The seven
[1:38:50] stars are the angels of the seven
[1:38:53] churches.
[1:38:54] But now remember down through those
[1:38:56] church ages, they had scruples.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; They still believed in the trinity. They
[1:39:04] still believed. Let's stand. Musicians,
[1:39:06] come.
[1:39:09] They thought God was three, not one.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Water baptism, name, father, son, holy
[1:39:14] ghost. Hell was eternal. Catholic says
[1:39:18] there's a place called purgatory. Before
[1:39:19] you get to that place, you see all these
[1:39:22] things that beliefs that are listen,
[1:39:24] they're still hanging here. They're
[1:39:26] still here with us today. Those same
[1:39:29] demons
[1:39:31] are here today.
[1:39:34] But what are they to the bride?
[1:39:37] They're to drive her back to her
[1:39:39] homeland.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Because I want to ask you a question.
[1:39:43] Who released those 200,000,000 demons in
[1:39:47] the river Euphrates?
[1:39:52] Who who
[1:39:56] Satan doesn't have the keys to death and
[1:39:58] hell. Satan doesn't have the key to
[1:39:59] hell. Who has the key?
[1:40:03] Jesus Christ himself has the key. He
[1:40:06] released those demons.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "How in the world?" Listen, you
[1:40:10] tell me how brother Brian would tell us
[1:40:12] that he'd have one brother say something
[1:40:13] to another brother just to see how
[1:40:15] brother would react.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; That's a devil.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. You may not like it,
[1:40:21] but God released those 200,000,000
[1:40:23] demons to drive us back to him.
[1:40:26] Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[1:40:30] he unsealed it, but he also unsealed
[1:40:33] himself to prove that we can defeat
[1:40:36] defeat all of those 200,000,000 demons.
[1:40:40] Even in our human flesh,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; we are undefeable,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; bride. It doesn't matter if we have to
[1:40:47] put you in a tomb. You are undefeable.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; THE WRAPPING MAY HAVE TO COME OFF. THE
[1:40:55] WRAPPING MAY HAVE TO GO BY the grave,
[1:40:57] but that gift that's inside never will
[1:40:58] go away. That gift that you got will
[1:41:01] bring you right back out of that grave.
[1:41:03] And then you can say, THEN YOU CAN SAY,
[1:41:06] "ALL POWER IN HEAVEN and earth has been
[1:41:08] given unto ME." HEY, WHEN THOSE PEOPLE
[1:41:10] COME OUT OF THAT other dimension, they
[1:41:12] come in here with their glorified
[1:41:13] bodies. How are they going to get
[1:41:14] harmed?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; You could throw AN ATOMIC BOMB RIGHT
[1:41:18] THROUGH THEM AND IT WOULDN'T KILL THEM.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; SO, ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH HAS
[1:41:22] BEEN GIVEN UNTO US. WE HAVE GOT A PIECE
[1:41:25] OF IT right now.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; You got TO HAVE A PIECE OF IT to carry
[1:41:28] us to the promised land.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; So now IT'S NOT JUST ONE STAR. WE have
[1:41:34] seen a star in the east. Now I've seen
[1:41:36] stars.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Constellation of angels that's driving
[1:41:40] us back to our homeland that's preaching
[1:41:43] in the pullpit that's singing the songs,
[1:41:45] playing the instruments. That's what it
[1:41:47] is. It's angels pushing us toward God.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:41:53] God's perfect gift.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; What a gift.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, if that same
[1:42:04] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:42:07] dwell in you,
[1:42:10] dwell in you.
[1:42:12] If that same spirit that raised Jesus
[1:42:16] from the dead dwell in you,
[1:42:20] dwell in you.
[1:42:25] your mortal body
[1:42:28] by his spirit
[1:42:31] that dwelt in you.
[1:42:36] I mean your blood.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Hand one to Danny. Hand one to Danny
[1:42:40] when you go by. Okay to help you.
[1:42:45] If the same spirit that raised you from
[1:42:49] the dead dwells in you,
[1:42:52] dwells in you.
[1:42:55] If the same
[1:42:58] that raised from your dead well in you,
[1:43:03] dwell in you.
[1:43:05] [Music]
[1:43:06] If we love your Lord, oh God, too high
[1:43:10] for me. And if the spirit
[1:43:14] dwells in you,
[1:43:17] it will wake up your blood.
[1:43:22] If that spirit
[1:43:25] in you,
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:29] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:43:32] dwells in you.
[1:43:35] dwells in you.
[1:43:38] If the same spirit that raised Christ
[1:43:42] from the dead dwells in you,
[1:43:46] dwells in you.
[1:43:49] [Applause]
[1:43:51] Your body
[1:43:54] in this
[1:43:56] dwells in you.
[1:43:59] It will bring your your body
[1:44:04] in the spirit.
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:13] Shine
[1:44:15] on me,
[1:44:17] Lord. Shine
[1:44:20] on me.
[1:44:23] Let the light
[1:44:25] from the lighthouse
[1:44:29] shine
[1:44:30] on me.
[1:44:33] Oh, shine
[1:44:36] on me.
[1:44:38] Oh Lord, shine
[1:44:41] on me.
[1:44:43] Oh, let the light
[1:44:46] from the lighthouse
[1:44:49] shine.
[1:44:51] Sing it to him again.
[1:44:53] Oh, shine
[1:44:56] on me.
[1:44:59] Oh, shine
[1:45:02] on me.
[1:45:04] Let the light
[1:45:07] from the lighthouse
[1:45:10] shine
[1:45:12] on me.
[1:45:15] Oh, shine
[1:45:17] on me.
[1:45:20] Oh, shine
[1:45:23] on me.
[1:45:25] So let the light
[1:45:27] from the lighthouse
[1:45:31] shine
[1:45:33] on me.
[1:45:36] Amen.
[1:45:38] The gift of eternal life. No one can
[1:45:41] give it but one man.
[1:45:43] But God came specially in this end time
[1:45:46] through a little prophet to bring us a
[1:45:48] word
[1:45:50] back to the perfection that it should
[1:45:51] have been.
[1:45:53] So I believe we have the right gift and
[1:45:55] I believe it's in the right wrapping
[1:45:57] paper now. So now it's time for us to
[1:45:59] unveil Jesus Christ. The mighty God
[1:46:02] unveiled before us the unveiling of God.
[1:46:05] Brother Ryan preached what? Unveiled to
[1:46:07] who? Unveiled to the word but unveiled
[1:46:09] through human beings.
[1:46:11] Only way it can be. God's not coming
[1:46:14] back to this earth until we come back in
[1:46:15] the millennium. Come on.
[1:46:18] He'll come back with us. So, it's got to
[1:46:21] happen in my life and your life. This is
[1:46:24] what's got to happen. We've got to
[1:46:25] become Mrs. Jesus Christ on earth. And I
[1:46:29] believe we are. I believe we are. God
[1:46:32] bless you all. We love you. Uh now,
[1:46:34] we're going to sing one more song and
[1:46:36] then uh just kind of don't rush through
[1:46:39] the back door because we've got uh
[1:46:41] something we want to give each person as
[1:46:44] they go down the down the stairs. So,
[1:46:46] just just keep singing. And as you're
[1:46:48] singing, Brother Joe, just let the the
[1:46:50] back row start and the rows go out or
[1:46:52] either the front row go out.
[1:46:57] Be with your family. Do not come
[1:46:59] individually if unless you're an
[1:47:01] individual. If you have a family, go out
[1:47:03] with your family. Okay? So, we can do
[1:47:06] this without confusion. So, let's start.
[1:47:08] I tell you what, let's start with the
[1:47:09] with the back row.
[1:47:12] And as you go out, we're going to sing.
[1:47:14] Hang on a minute before we do. Uh, we're
[1:47:16] going to sing a song and we'll just keep
[1:47:17] singing until everybody's out. Now, when
[1:47:18] you get out of this building, do not go
[1:47:21] drink coffee and and fellowship. Get in
[1:47:24] the car and head down. It's about 8
[1:47:26] miles down to the to the uh venue and
[1:47:29] there we can fellowship for hours and
[1:47:32] it's a big old place for those of you
[1:47:34] haven't been. Everybody please come cuz
[1:47:36] we made this especially for you guys
[1:47:40] that we have u done this for years and
[1:47:42] years and we're going to continue to do
[1:47:43] it. So, we appreciate all of you and
[1:47:46] we'll pray over the food down there. But
[1:47:48] just everybody, please do not lolly gag
[1:47:51] around. Get in your car and let's head
[1:47:53] on down there. And then, like I said
[1:47:54] before, we can fellowship for hours down
[1:47:56] there in a great big room where you

[1:48:00] is. So, God bless you. Let's sing one
[1:48:02] more time. Brother Joe, sing a song. And
[1:48:05] I thank God
[1:48:08] for
