[14:16] Happy Thanksgiving to everyone which
[14:18] will be this coming Thursday and please
[14:21] be
[14:22] safe it's like brother Boyd said I've
[14:24] been talking
[14:25] to uh one head of a family there in
[14:27] Gillsville today and he said this thing
[14:30] just tore his family apart because some
[14:32] of the daughters don't want to come some
[14:33] of the sons don't want to come and the
[14:34] ones that aren't coming are mad at the
[14:36] ones that are not coming and so anyway
[14:39] turmoil everywhere so but
[14:43] uh we're going to make it amen amen
[14:46] we're going to make it amen we've got a
[14:48] promise to make it now they may not have
[14:50] a promise to make it we got a promise to
[14:52] make it all right
[14:56] amen so that's where I rest in I rest in
[14:59] that I don't rest in a uh a
[15:03] vaccine we took the vaccine when we were
[15:06] always when we seen that high and lifted
[15:08] up you know what that is that's when
[15:09] Christ went to Calvary he said if he
[15:11] said if I don't he said he said if I be
[15:15] lifted up he was lifted up by a
[15:18] Roman
[15:20] Tree but he was lifted for me and you
[15:23] and you and I don't have to we don't
[15:25] have to die we don't have to take any of
[15:27] this anymore he took it every bit the
[15:29] only thing we got to do is believe that
[15:31] he's already done it
[15:33] amen and that's why that we in this uh
[15:36] series of two Spirits I've been thinking
[15:38] the week um we see that we when we've
[15:42] been doing the contrast back in Genesis
[15:45] and the different places it looks like
[15:46] evil against good and it always is evil
[15:49] against good but when you get down to
[15:51] the end time it's evil against good and
[15:54] you don't know the difference unless you
[15:55] got the Holy Ghost and even with the
[15:57] Holy Ghost you can be deceived right but
[16:01] you can't be lost right right can't be
[16:04] lost right you're not going to lose
[16:06] that's why we're we're going to speak
[16:07] tonight on 10
[16:09] virgins and we'll get to the end of that
[16:11] and cuz there's where you two Spirits
[16:13] are because even though they are virgins
[16:16] the five foolish virgins did not have
[16:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they
[16:20] had another Spirit besides the Holy
[16:23] Spirit right but they had just enough of
[16:25] God till their
[16:27] testimony helped them get all the way to
[16:29] the white Throne judgment and be given
[16:31] eternal life I don't want to stake my
[16:33] chances on that folks right uhuh no I
[16:37] want to be one of the wise virgins amen
[16:40] so if you got your Bibles let's turn to
[16:41] 1 John
[16:42] 4 and continue with this just keep us in
[16:45] your prayer like I said again have a
[16:47] safe Thanksgiving we will be back here
[16:48] Sunday Lord with him brother Dale will
[16:50] be speaking then we'll have a baptismal
[16:52] service afterwards so also like as
[16:55] brother Boyd said Brother D now we're
[16:57] talking coming down coming back from
[16:58] Illinois the other day and he wants to
[17:01] get back into the special singing cuz
[17:04] you know if we do the order of what the
[17:05] church order says well brother Bram says
[17:08] a couple of congregational songs a
[17:11] couple of outstanding he says
[17:13] outstanding specials take up an offering
[17:15] and bring a preacher out instead of this
[17:17] long 15 song thing you know we're going
[17:20] to go by what brother Brown says a
[17:22] couple of specials right couple of songs
[17:24] couple of worship songs which was good
[17:26] tonight couple of worship songs to get
[17:28] in worship atmosphere and then bring the
[17:30] minister out cuz that's what's important
[17:32] amen so that's what we're going to try
[17:33] to do also if you don't have this sheet
[17:36] I don't know if brother Joe's got it but
[17:38] he can get it for you of the list of the
[17:40] people and make sure your song leaders
[17:43] get them before they get here right we
[17:47] want them to either call them or let
[17:49] them practice don't just rush up and say
[17:51] Zach you're singing tonight no we want
[17:54] we want you to be able to practice cuz
[17:56] we want you to do your best right and
[17:58] like teren said if you need to practice
[18:00] in the shower that's fine you can
[18:02] practice in the shower just don't expect
[18:03] any musicians to be
[18:06] around except the water running out of
[18:08] the shower so two Spirits we're going to
[18:11] speak on 10 virgins tonight let's bow
[18:12] our heads heavenly father thank you for
[18:14] this day that you've given us Lord that
[18:16] we can still stand here in
[18:19] Freedom that we'll always be free in
[18:21] Christ but Lord there's another Spirit
[18:24] working in the end time that's trying to
[18:27] suppress us and keep us from worshiping
[18:29] together and keep us from fellowshipping
[18:32] together and Lord we're sheep we're herd
[18:35] animals we need to be together we need
[18:37] to have each other to lean on we have to
[18:39] have each other to talk on we don't
[18:41] we're not loners Lord we are hurt
[18:44] animals we're sheep of your pastor Lord
[18:47] and we pray that you would just bind all
[18:49] the enemies that's trying to come not so
[18:52] much into the church but into our bodies
[18:55] now as many times we're talking about uh
[18:57] our spiritual need well right now I
[18:59] think we're in a transition between
[19:02] physical need and spiritual need father
[19:04] but we always need you spiritually but
[19:06] now Lord we need you in the Physical
[19:07] Realm to help us Lord get through this
[19:11] you said that we have won but you said
[19:14] that we would have to overcome in order
[19:16] to win so father there's something that
[19:18] we have to overcome Lord and it's these
[19:20] two spirits that we need to discern yes
[19:23] what's right and what's wrong father
[19:24] forgive us of our sins be with the ones
[19:26] Lord that are fighting this disease
[19:27] Brother Ray mcgomery now as wife Sister
[19:30] Rita Lord we also pray for the Johnny
[19:32] silky family we forgot to announce but
[19:34] we will now Lord you know he went on to
[19:36] be with you Lord a couple of nights ago
[19:38] we pray for the family that you'll give
[19:40] them Lord just compassion and peace that
[19:44] no one else can give them Lord bless
[19:45] brother Claude is now he's lost a church
[19:47] member there Lord a song leader we pray
[19:49] that You' just fill that void father
[19:51] with someone that's that's full of the
[19:53] Holy Ghost and can help the people
[19:55] father give us today our daily bread you
[19:57] be the one that speaks Lord and let us
[19:59] all be the ones that listens to what you
[20:01] say we ask these things in the name of
[20:03] the Lord Jesus Christ amen yeah I pray
[20:07] for brother Claude you know he Lo he
[20:08] lost his song leader and brother Johnny
[20:10] was a real uh solid uh brother in the
[20:15] church and uh he just couldn't overcome
[20:19] it wasn't all covid related he had many
[20:21] different issues but they
[20:24] all bounced off each other for a few
[20:26] days and then all of a sudden he started
[20:28] bleeding internally and he passed away a
[20:30] couple days ago so uh really good
[20:33] brother enjoyed him didn't with Dad he's
[20:35] real good brother so 1 John 4 verse1
[20:38] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[20:40] the spirits for the L of God you know
[20:42] you do that every
[20:43] day that's not just coming in on Sunday
[20:46] and on Wednesday if you fight the devil
[20:48] only right here you're in
[20:50] trouble you ought to fight him more out
[20:52] there and shed him when you walk in here
[20:55] amen so beloved believe not every Spirit
[20:57] but try the spirit were the they of God
[20:59] because many false prophets are gone out
[21:01] into the world and see that's what we're
[21:03] going to talk about on the 10 versions
[21:05] how those false prophets deceive there
[21:07] is no false prophet can do you any good
[21:11] right except show you the false but
[21:15] you've got to be able to see that
[21:17] because there's a lot of people think
[21:19] that they're true and they're false
[21:21] right amen that's where the deception is
[21:24] hereby know ye the spirit of God every
[21:27] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[21:29] is come in the flesh is of God and every
[21:31] spirit that confesses not that Jesus
[21:32] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[21:34] God and this is that Spirit of
[21:37] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[21:39] should come and even now already is it
[21:42] in the world that's been 2,000 years ago
[21:46] think about that was an infant form
[21:48] there think about now at the headship
[21:51] time where Satan comes to his head and
[21:54] Christ comes to his headship how much
[21:57] more deceiving it is
[21:59] ye are of God little children and have
[22:00] overcome them because greater is he
[22:02] that's in you than he that's in the
[22:04] world they are of the world therefore
[22:06] speak they of the world and the world
[22:08] heareth them we are of God he that
[22:10] knoweth God heareth us he that is not of
[22:13] God heareth not us hereby know we the
[22:14] spirit of truth and the spirit of error
[22:17] you may be seated the Lord as his
[22:18] Blessing to the reading of the word just
[22:21] remember those announcements and uh like
[22:23] I said just go back to the first of the
[22:25] tape if you want them again just go back
[22:26] to the first of the tape and you you'll
[22:28] hear the announcement all over again so
[22:30] um have no confusion this is the age of
[22:34] instant information and if you need it
[22:36] again all you got to do is pull it back
[22:38] up hit refresh so now let's go to
[22:40] Matthew ma Matthew 25 verse 1 says then
[22:44] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened
[22:47] unto 10
[22:48] virgins which took their lamps and went
[22:51] forth to meet the
[22:52] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[22:56] and five of them were foolish
[22:58] they that were foolish took their lamps
[23:00] and took no oil with them but the wise
[23:03] took oil in their
[23:05] vessels with their lamps right amen we
[23:08] know what we know what the type of the
[23:10] oil in the Bible is the baptism of the
[23:13] Holy Ghost so that means one has it and
[23:15] one didn't all right now remember as we
[23:18] go through this we're going to
[23:19] background just a minute but keep this
[23:21] in your mind there is no in between
[23:25] Christian either you're lost
[23:29] or you're saved you're either sealed in
[23:31] or you're sealed out exactly and you by
[23:34] your character will be able to know that
[23:38] by Jesus said by your fruits you shall
[23:41] be known all right so by your fruits
[23:44] you're going the world is going to
[23:47] see manifesting time like never
[23:51] before this is going to the cream's
[23:53] going to rise to the top the world
[23:56] always talks about having all their uh
[23:58] you know their star athletes you know
[24:01] they they put the last the fastest guy
[24:03] on the fourth leg of the of the of the
[24:07] relay why that means if you're a little
[24:10] bit behind you got your best guy to
[24:13] finish the race well you know what God's
[24:14] got his best guy the Bride of Jesus
[24:17] Christ to finish this race it may seem
[24:20] like somebody got behind but I think
[24:22] when the prophet went off the scene he
[24:24] passed the Baton to me and you he didn't
[24:27] pass the Baton to one person he passed
[24:29] it to a many membered bride to take us
[24:32] out of here and get us in a Rapture all
[24:37] right so now let's read what um the one
[24:41] we've always read exposition of the
[24:43] church ages just to background just for
[24:44] a
[24:46] minute now remember this Christ in the
[24:48] true church is a a continuation of the
[24:50] book of Acts that's what we're looking
[24:51] at now but the Book of Revelation so how
[24:54] that Antichrist Spirit would come now
[24:56] look not so much in the book of Acts
[24:58] when you see the book of Acts you see
[25:01] the book of The Acts of the
[25:03] Apostles and what's going on Silver and
[25:06] Gold Have I None they walked to the
[25:07] shadow of Peter and got healed they they
[25:10] had all things common they had all these
[25:12] different things and but now the Book of
[25:16] Revelations is a prophetic book right a
[25:19] book of Revelations is where it splits
[25:21] to two because as brother Bram tells us
[25:23] we were we I was listening to brother
[25:26] Brown the other day and the Lord just
[25:27] showed you know everything started in
[25:29] Genesis so you see the two Spirits right
[25:32] there Christ and Lucifer Cain and Abel
[25:35] every how you want to say it and then it
[25:37] kind of as we were talking last time
[25:40] remember the sons of God married the
[25:41] daughters of men and you really couldn't
[25:44] tell who was who right even in the
[25:47] spiritual world because if you were to
[25:49] look at balam and all these different
[25:51] ones that were anti- word you think hey
[25:54] balam did not
[25:56] do anything at the point that
[26:00] God remember he done the seven reals he
[26:03] done all the sacrificing Bok wanted him
[26:06] to go out there and curse Israel and Bam
[26:09] says I can't well man we' think oh man
[26:12] that's a holy ghost filed preacher buddy
[26:13] he he told that guy what no he was just
[26:17] buying his time because the devil was
[26:19] working the whole time oh yeah he was
[26:21] working all way down through until balum
[26:25] finally figured out by that other spirit
[26:28] that he could not override God's will
[26:32] but he could go around just like what
[26:34] did what did Satan do he did the same
[26:36] thing he couldn't directly go and say
[26:38] now Eve you know God's not
[26:40] real no he said I know God's real but
[26:43] you'll not surely
[26:45] die bam just goes over there and says
[26:48] hey let's just get them all to marry
[26:49] again so here you go back into intering
[26:51] intermingling again right now what have
[26:53] you done down through we'll talk about
[26:55] in just a few minutes with the 10
[26:56] virgins you see that when Jesus came on
[26:59] Earth there was Jesus Jesus and Judas
[27:01] now remember let's get one thing for
[27:04] sure
[27:06] Judas was not the beginning of evil the
[27:10] beginning of evil was Lucifer we know
[27:11] that but it hid itself all the way down
[27:14] but just for a moment it popped his head
[27:16] up with Judas because remember Judas
[27:18] wasn't an adversary of Jesus until right
[27:21] at the very end right right Jesus called
[27:24] him
[27:25] friend Jesus said I know what you're
[27:28] going to do but I'm still going to
[27:29] choose
[27:30] you the Bible says he knew from the
[27:33] beginning when he chose him so here you
[27:36] go putting it back together again but
[27:39] then you see Paul comes out and Paul
[27:41] says Grievous wolves will come among you
[27:43] then here in first
[27:45] John and John sees the Antichrist and he
[27:48] sees that it splits a little bit but in
[27:50] the end time it goes right back together
[27:52] so we have to go to the Book of
[27:53] Revelations is what brother Brown saying
[27:55] we got to go to the Book of Revelations
[27:57] to show show how that the Antichrist
[28:00] Spirit would come into the
[28:02] church how it would come in defile it
[28:05] making it lukew formal and Powerless it
[28:09] exposes Satan revealing his work the
[28:11] attempted destruction of God's people
[28:13] and the discrediting of God's word now
[28:15] not doing away with God's word just
[28:16] discrediting it exactly all right right
[28:19] down to the time he is cast into the
[28:21] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[28:22] stand it he knows that if the people see
[28:26] know he knows he's sitting here today
[28:29] listening to every sermon that's being
[28:30] preached all over the well of course on
[28:33] Tuesday night there's not many but every
[28:35] time a sermon is being preached the
[28:36] devil's right there he's listening to
[28:40] see what's going on so he can counteract
[28:43] because I don't think he has prophetic
[28:45] Insight I don't think he knows what's
[28:47] going to happen
[28:48] tomorrow if he does he don't believe
[28:51] it cuz if he did he'd just lay down and
[28:54] die I'd just give up cuz you know the
[28:58] the the the Bible says he loses and we
[29:01] win right
[29:04] but there was so much iniquity found in
[29:08] him just like in the world now when
[29:10] everybody thinks they're
[29:13] right I mean it's come down to my
[29:15] goodness look at the new cabinet that we
[29:16] got coming in with the with the new
[29:18] Administration I mean come on people
[29:21] this world is in trouble a transgender
[29:23] couple of
[29:24] homosexuals okay leading our government
[29:30] leading our government and I'm not
[29:32] saying anything between the two parties
[29:34] I'm just telling you it's all corrupt
[29:35] there is not one thing good except the
[29:38] goodness of God that's going to show us
[29:42] that a government's not going to save
[29:45] you the kingdom of God is going to save
[29:49] you amen he knows that if the people get
[29:52] the true revelation of the true church
[29:54] and what she is and what she stands for
[29:57] and that she can can do the Greater
[29:58] Works she will be an invincible Army if
[30:02] they get a true revelation of the two
[30:03] Spirits within the framework as I said
[30:05] before the the 2x4s of the Christian
[30:08] church not this building but this
[30:11] building
[30:13] yeah and by God's spirit discern and
[30:16] withstand so there's got to be somebody
[30:18] that's going to discern and withstand it
[30:22] and they're not going to be popular oh
[30:24] no they're going to be hated right
[30:27] brother Brown said that hated group I'll
[30:28] bring that quote in another sermon that
[30:30] he said that hated
[30:33] group they'll hate you who not the
[30:37] denominations message
[30:40] folks are going to hate
[30:42] you cuz you've got a true revelation of
[30:45] the two Spirits within the framework of
[30:47] this message church right not so much
[30:49] this one but I'm everywhere there is two
[30:52] Spirits working in every church I don't
[30:53] care where it's at
[30:55] amen and remember God's not trying to
[30:58] get he's tried to get back in the
[30:59] denominations but brother M said they've
[31:01] already put them out now we were
[31:02] listening to a tape coming home the
[31:03] other day and you think we get a
[31:07] little Budd he heads were rolling and he
[31:11] was preaching to baptist Methodist
[31:13] Pentecostal talking about what kind of
[31:16] demons they had in them with wearing the
[31:17] shorts and the hair and the dress boy
[31:20] brother randam let them have it right
[31:22] that's why it wasn't very popular but
[31:24] you know what it was the
[31:25] Bible but if they get a true re reation
[31:28] of the two Spirits within the framework
[31:29] of the Christian church and by God's
[31:30] spirit deser and withstand the
[31:32] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[31:34] powerless before her number
[31:37] two an exposition of the seven Church
[31:40] ages this is quote number two did you
[31:42] get it now there are those twins again
[31:44] there are those two trees again growing
[31:46] side by side in the same Earth partaking
[31:50] of the same
[31:51] message hello somebody that's n don't
[31:54] you get you get nourished Yeah by apples
[31:56] and oranges and green beans and but your
[31:59] soul gets nourished by the word of God
[32:02] and not by the false word you can't get
[32:04] nourishment from a false word if you're
[32:07] a True Believer that's right
[32:09] right drinking in the same rain and
[32:13] benefitting by the same son right but
[32:16] they come from different seeds one tree
[32:18] is for the word of God exactly as God
[32:21] give it and loves it and obeys it the
[32:23] other tree is from the seed that is anti
[32:25] the word of God and changes it where it
[32:27] wants to it substitutes its own Creeds
[32:30] and dogmas for the living true word
[32:32] exactly as did Cain who ended up killing
[32:34] Abel but fear not little flock stay with
[32:37] the word keep that word between you and
[32:39] the devil Eve did not do that and she
[32:41] failed and when the church lets down on
[32:44] the word she goes into the depths of the
[32:46] darkness right of Satan wow that's a
[32:50] that's a powerful quote because you know
[32:51] what that's what happened when you and
[32:53] you go to your 10 virgins sure they're
[32:55] virgins but they weren't filled with the
[32:57] Holy Holy Ghost yeah they were filled
[33:00] with anti- word right now some were in
[33:03] there in their Spirit realm and that
[33:06] sanctification part that's going to
[33:08] carry them but they're going to have to
[33:09] die in the tribulation and they're going
[33:11] to have to come before the white throne
[33:14] and give an account of what they did
[33:18] right listen if you're born again
[33:20] tonight you'll never have to give an
[33:23] account of what you did glory amen you
[33:26] never will have to give an count on what
[33:28] you did cuz you know what the real you
[33:30] didn't do
[33:32] it there's the wise virgins that fills
[33:35] their oil with something besides Creeds
[33:37] and dogmas and I'm talking about in the
[33:40] message right I'm not talking about out
[33:43] there if that fools you you're in
[33:46] trouble you need to get the Holy
[33:51] Ghost I mean listen we're so far up the
[33:53] road now till goodness gracious
[34:00] let's look at the law of reproduction
[34:02] cuz remember the law of reproduction
[34:05] caused this
[34:06] deception because God said let every
[34:08] seed bring forth of its kind and Satan
[34:11] was standing there and he said okay I
[34:14] know what Adam's got and I know what
[34:15] Eve's got and I'm going to work on Eve
[34:18] because she's the weaker one of the two
[34:20] and I'm going to deceive her because
[34:24] deception is the cause to accept as true
[34:26] or valid what is false are invalid right
[34:30] she accepted truth as if she accepted
[34:33] sorry false as if it were truth she
[34:37] accepted that the church the first
[34:39] church Eve was the first
[34:42] church and that's what she accepted and
[34:45] she accepted it as truth let's look at
[34:48] Matthew 6:22 the light of the body is
[34:50] the eye if therefore th ey be single thy
[34:52] whole body shall be full of
[34:55] light but if thine eye be evil right thy
[35:00] whole body shall be full of Darkness if
[35:03] therefore the light that is in thee be
[35:05] Darkness how great is that Darkness
[35:08] right let's read number three what does
[35:10] it take to have make a Christian Life
[35:11] Eve actually thought she was right
[35:14] listen Eve didn't go into this thinking
[35:16] that she was some that it was some dirty
[35:19] act she was trying to fulfill the word
[35:22] of God by her interpretation along with
[35:25] the devil right right ain't that what
[35:28] happening
[35:30] now they're interpreting the word to fit
[35:33] what they think is the word of God now
[35:36] listen these people are not going to
[35:38] church to think of evil they're not
[35:40] going to church to think they're
[35:43] anti no that's the deception yeah right
[35:47] the prophet of God said in the end time
[35:48] they'll be actually making love with
[35:51] Satan thinking they're making love are
[35:53] knowing god right that's the deception
[35:58] how deceiving but if that light in you
[36:00] be Darkness how great is that Darkness
[36:02] how can you tell
[36:03] them that it's
[36:06] dark how can you tell them and look at
[36:08] the Methodist and look at the M Baptist
[36:10] and look at the people in the message
[36:12] with all these weird doctrines how can
[36:14] you look at them and say you're false
[36:16] right if they think that's light you got
[36:19] to fight exactly maybe sometimes
[36:24] physical get their righteous indignation
[36:26] up
[36:28] but you know one thing's for sure if you
[36:30] do that that's another Spirit right
[36:35] amen Eve actually thought she was right
[36:38] so this whole pretense of these two
[36:40] Spirits there is that look that there's
[36:43] only one guy that knows he's
[36:47] antiw and that's Satan right he knows
[36:51] he's against the word he hates the word
[36:53] he hates the people of the word but he
[36:55] wants the people to be
[36:58] deceived into believing that what
[37:01] they're hearing is from God if you
[37:04] people get
[37:08] that that's what he's doing it's so
[37:12] close not so evil right I know I did
[37:17] Evil right but if I'm standing here
[37:19] today with the wrong spirit and a wrong
[37:21] Doctrine I'm just as I'm more evil right
[37:25] than if I was drinking a beer and
[37:26] smoking a cigar I might have a
[37:31] chance but you won't have a chance
[37:33] listen you say all those virgins were
[37:36] those were virgin yes but listen they
[37:39] were
[37:41] false they were part of the Antichrist
[37:44] system there's only Christ and
[37:46] Antichrist there is no in between there
[37:49] is no gray area that we can get so much
[37:52] and then not get enough but still make
[37:55] it you're either sealed in
[37:58] or you're sealed out
[38:00] amen she was getting some new
[38:03] light now listen Satan's transformed
[38:07] into a messenger of light we know that
[38:09] but his light is Darkness folks right
[38:12] remember he's a painting fire he's one
[38:14] of those
[38:15] Illusions to make you think that it's
[38:17] the light of God right see how deceiving
[38:20] it is she was getting some new light
[38:23] that Satan was giving her he's still
[38:26] giving her
[38:28] new light right folks that was
[38:32] 6,000 years ago that Eve got new light
[38:37] from Satan 6,000 years ago don't you
[38:41] think he's more deceptive now than he
[38:43] was 6,000 years ago it's not a baby form
[38:47] anymore it's a full grown man that
[38:50] Antichrist is going to be a full grown
[38:53] head of the world he is actually
[38:56] probably right now being groomed and
[38:58] fixed I know it's that close right that
[39:02] he's being groomed and fixed by Satan
[39:04] himself but through a
[39:10] system but the but but the Methodist
[39:12] said it's not us because we got God and
[39:14] the B says no it's not us cuz we got God
[39:16] and the Pentecost says no we got God and
[39:18] then half the message people that are
[39:19] half message people I don't know which
[39:22] half but they think oh we're of God we
[39:24] go to church we believe God sent a
[39:26] prophet that's okay
[39:29] but let this thing go on I told you when
[39:32] we
[39:32] started I'm not preaching to
[39:35] people you preach to
[39:38] Spirits because a spirit even can get on
[39:41] you and me a wrong spirit and have to be
[39:45] prayed away or prayed off or or get rid
[39:48] of as as I was carrying that one around
[39:52] against this
[39:54] brother all you got to do man just call
[39:56] him and apologize you know what that's
[39:59] why the Bible says res resist the devil
[40:01] and he'll flee from you you know what
[40:04] you're resisting you're not resisting
[40:05] the devil and you know no you're doing
[40:08] what God
[40:11] Said by doing that that resists the
[40:14] devil cuz he hates the right part of the
[40:16] word he hates for you to do the word
[40:18] right that's why he's so deceived the
[40:24] people had a situation just
[40:27] few days
[40:30] ago I mean how you going to
[40:34] tell we hunt with a group of people that
[40:37] I know they're not going to listen to
[40:38] this so it doesn't matter I can call
[40:39] their name but they're
[40:44] religious they
[40:46] pray problem knows they pray they talk
[40:49] about
[40:50] God sometimes use his name a little bit
[40:54] different but they drink smoke curse
[40:58] live with their women and don't marry
[40:59] them you understand what I'm saying but
[41:01] yet they go to church oh yeah now you
[41:03] see that and but I'm not judging those
[41:05] people I see that that spirit I was
[41:08] telling you coming to church how can he
[41:11] be a Christian how can they brother John
[41:14] is that your keys laying on the floor
[41:15] there I just discerned
[41:18] that they were laying right beside you
[41:21] so anyway you may need them to get out
[41:23] of
[41:24] here and you'll blame the kids for
[41:26] having them and
[41:27] okay but how can
[41:30] you be in the
[41:33] same mold yeah as that and say you've
[41:38] got the Holy Ghost and they talk about
[41:41] the Holy Spirit oh the Holy Spirit told
[41:43] me to do this God told me to do this and
[41:45] yet they're sitting there drinking their
[41:47] Bush light smoking their cigarettes
[41:49] cursing using God's name in vain but
[41:51] they're Christians now see to me that
[41:53] doesn't that doesn't fool me but look
[41:56] how fool who they
[41:58] are you want to look at them and say
[42:02] dude if you got the Holy Ghost and I got
[42:04] the Holy Ghost and my Holy Ghost says
[42:07] not to do that that's right my Holy
[42:10] Ghost actually forbids me to do that and
[42:13] I enjoy it because I don't have that
[42:15] Spirit you got anymore you know what
[42:17] that's going to make them mad oh because
[42:19] they think they have light right they've
[42:22] been
[42:23] told it's okay oh you know what the
[42:26] first thing they'll say to you nobody's
[42:29] perfect we all got
[42:32] problems talking to a guy the other day
[42:34] there at the at um in
[42:37] Gillsville and he had been God had
[42:39] healed him with cancer a long time ago
[42:42] but his whole thought was is you know I
[42:44] fall I slip up I say God's name in vain
[42:47] every once in a while I I you know he he
[42:49] was making
[42:51] excuses and like I said I'm not talking
[42:54] about my
[42:54] people I'm not talking about the people
[42:57] that we talk about or that we hunt with
[43:01] I'm talking about the spirit that's
[43:02] motivating
[43:04] that and they're saying it's the Holy
[43:06] Spirit The Same Spirit I got right and
[43:10] sometimes it rises up inside me and I
[43:12] don't know whether it's the Holy Spirit
[43:13] of
[43:15] mine yeah sister an got about that big
[43:18] too but you know you don't know when
[43:20] that thing Rises up and you're and
[43:23] you let them have it in other words yeah
[43:27] you know brother rown did that one time
[43:28] remember he sat down and that guy got up
[43:30] and was just letting him have it and he
[43:32] said that guy beside him was going to
[43:33] get up and say something he said no he
[43:35] said I wanted any myself right well see
[43:37] sometime every once in a while you take
[43:39] about all you can take and then you look
[43:42] them straight in the eye and say
[43:44] brother I'm your brother I love you with
[43:46] the love of the Lord but you ain't got
[43:49] the same spirit I got either you wrong
[43:51] and I'm right or I'm right and you're
[43:53] wrong but we both can't be right
[43:59] now listen that's a deception of the
[44:01] world now let's bring that spirit in
[44:04] though and set it in this
[44:06] church and say I wear my dresses long I
[44:09] have my hair long I don't smoke I don't
[44:12] drink I don't curse I come to church
[44:16] every Sunday I come to church every
[44:19] Wednesday I must be all
[44:23] right but then let something happen
[44:28] let somebody say something to you let
[44:30] something happen let
[44:34] something help you bear your
[44:38] fruit actually help you show your
[44:41] fruit and then you you wonder what's
[44:43] going on well see that's where the two
[44:45] Spirits are come back together now I'm
[44:47] not worried about that I'm not wor see
[44:49] I'm not worried about brother Donnie I
[44:51] am not worried about Brett and those
[44:52] people up there in Illinois deceiving me
[44:55] they're deceived
[44:58] right we don't have the same Spirit
[45:01] there is no
[45:02] way we know
[45:04] that but how do you talk to somebody
[45:07] that thinks they're
[45:09] light and it's dark right their souls is
[45:13] black as sight and if they don't change
[45:15] their ways they're going to hell or
[45:17] they're going to have to be judged for
[45:18] what they done ex right cuz but now see
[45:21] the the five foolish virgins though are
[45:24] A step above that
[45:28] see there's a group of
[45:29] people that in the gospels that come up
[45:32] to Jesus at the at the at the end and
[45:35] says have I
[45:36] not cast out Devils have I not preached
[45:40] your gospel have they're so bold they're
[45:43] look Jesus is giving them judgment and
[45:46] they're going have I not done these
[45:49] things in your
[45:51] name you know what he's going to say
[45:54] depart from me I never had a personal
[45:57] relationship with you and you never let
[46:00] me in that inner man right you never let
[46:04] me inside of the inside you let me on
[46:06] the inside yeah you might have cleaned
[46:09] my spirit up like you did with the 10
[46:11] virgins or the five foolish he cleaned
[46:13] their Spirit realm
[46:15] up but something stopped them that other
[46:19] Spirit or that other seed we want to
[46:21] talk about which seed is a word they
[46:24] took a false word and said it was true
[46:27] and that put them in another group oh
[46:29] yeah what about
[46:32] that like I said before I don't look at
[46:36] people I look at that spirit that is
[46:39] speaking through those
[46:41] people that is telling those
[46:43] people you're okay yeah you make
[46:47] mistakes what a couple of beers are not
[46:50] going to bother you a couple of and then
[46:52] you start adding these couplers up and
[46:55] it's like I asked that guy one time when
[46:57] I got saved he you know he held up a
[46:59] beer and said well praise the Lord I'm
[47:00] glad you got saved I
[47:02] said
[47:04] John John stump was his name he was a
[47:09] banker in
[47:10] Gainesville I said John what did you get
[47:12] save
[47:13] from I said save means to if I and we
[47:16] were out in a boat I said if I kicked
[47:17] you out of this boat into the
[47:20] water you don't think I kick it high at
[47:22] 60 years old did you it hurts but I did
[47:25] it twice
[47:28] Jun don't have to drag me out of bed in
[47:29] the
[47:30] morning I said John I said being saved
[47:33] is you were in a position when I kicked
[47:36] you out of the boat you need a
[47:38] saving now that was a different position
[47:40] than what you was before I said when I
[47:43] reached in that water and grabbed you
[47:44] out of that water and set you in the
[47:45] boat I saved
[47:48] you now what you just told me you did is
[47:52] you fell back in the
[47:54] water see they didn't get saved to start
[47:56] with they had an emotion they had a
[47:58] feeling they had a something going on
[48:00] thank God for a prophet but listen we
[48:02] take this and we look and we see that
[48:04] the prophet brought us further than
[48:08] that cuz remember folks before the
[48:12] prophet came and before the seals were
[48:13] opened God
[48:16] allowed water baptism in the name of
[48:18] father son Holy
[48:20] Ghost by permissive will he allowed all
[48:23] these denominations to come up we'll
[48:25] look at in just a second he allowed that
[48:27] to happen but
[48:29] remember God told him way back a long
[48:32] time he said I'll not always strive with
[48:33] man right I'm going to allow this in
[48:36] other words what he did back there in
[48:37] Genesis when the sons of God married the
[48:39] daughters of men then God said God
[48:41] actually the Bible said repented that he
[48:43] had made
[48:45] man knowing what they would do anyway
[48:48] right so he said I'm going to destroy
[48:49] them all but Noah found Grace in the
[48:54] eyes of the Lord glory amen have you and
[48:57] I found
[48:58] Grace in the eyes of the Lord Brother
[49:00] Brown told in one quote I didn't bring
[49:03] it he said those foolish virgins is like
[49:06] those people that were standing all
[49:08] those years and listen to Noah preach
[49:11] it's going to rain it's going to rain
[49:12] it's going to rain it's going to rain
[49:14] and then God shut the
[49:16] door he said those foolish virgins were
[49:20] the ones that were hanging on to the
[49:22] boat when the water was coming up
[49:27] they were that and and and the
[49:29] illustration was they were this far from
[49:32] being saved the thickness of the wall of
[49:35] the
[49:36] Ark was from condemnation to Salvation
[49:40] right if they would have just listened
[49:42] to the messenger of their day listen
[49:44] they didn't have to do the hair and the
[49:46] dress and don't go to this and don't do
[49:48] they just had to believe what Noah said
[49:50] right but you know what if they would
[49:53] have all believed that God would have
[49:55] had to buil a bigger boat
[49:57] or many other boats but he knew how many
[50:00] was going to accept it he knew how many
[50:01] was going to reject it and he built the
[50:03] boat for eight people and a bunch of
[50:06] animals that's what he's done now he
[50:08] knows how many is going to make it he
[50:10] know he knows who the wise virgin is he
[50:11] knows who the foolish virgin is but
[50:13] listen there's a place for the foolish
[50:15] virgin I don't want to be in that
[50:18] place don't ever think that you're
[50:21] sitting here today and saying well if I
[50:23] don't understand what brother Wade and
[50:24] brother Dale and all the different
[50:25] ministers are saying I'll just be a
[50:27] foolish virgin no you
[50:30] won't no no a foolish virgin was
[50:34] deceived by the word they heard right
[50:38] the seed that was planted by some
[50:40] preacher some
[50:42] somebody you didn't hear that from
[50:46] here amen you didn't hear that from here
[50:48] right amen all right Romans 9 let's go
[50:52] that my phone ringing
[50:55] barking I thought I cut cut it off
[50:58] anyway they'll call back later Romans 9
[51:02] verse 10
[51:04] watch remember we were talking about
[51:06] this word called election and not only
[51:08] this but when Rebecca also had conceived
[51:10] by one even my father Isaac for the
[51:13] children being not yet born neither
[51:15] having done any good or evil that the
[51:16] purpose of God according to election
[51:18] might stand now remember for those of
[51:21] you that weren't here we know what
[51:22] election is we just went through an
[51:23] election people voted people vot this
[51:25] many voted for this side there many
[51:27] voted for this side whoever got the most
[51:29] votes win
[51:31] one we had a a little election at and
[51:34] yes I do vote I'm an American sorry I
[51:36] vote so you know what I vote because I
[51:38] can say what I need to say about it okay
[51:41] if you didn't vote then shut
[51:43] up all right so anyway so we had this
[51:46] little special
[51:48] election and it was a um um his name's
[51:52] sweet boy hu but his name's Wayne hu but
[51:54] his wife ran for some probate J J she
[51:57] won by one vote they recounted recount
[52:00] she won by one vote it was the first
[52:02] time me and June had
[52:04] voted and we voted in that election and
[52:08] two of us voted for Helen his wife so I
[52:12] told when that came out I told Wayne I
[52:16] said me and June voted first time we
[52:18] voted in 20 years that's the first thing
[52:20] we vote we voted for Helen to be a
[52:22] probate judge and I said if we a have
[52:25] voted your wife would have lost
[52:29] yeah so God voted for
[52:32] you the devil voted against you
[52:35] somebody's got to untie the vote right
[52:38] because you're a free moral agent and
[52:40] your vote will give you two to one one
[52:42] way of the other all
[52:44] right according to election might stand
[52:48] not of works but of him that calleth it
[52:51] was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve
[52:53] the younger as it is written Jacob have
[52:55] I loved and all have I hated Romans 8:30
[52:59] we need to continue this thought because
[53:01] remember it's not just that he stamped
[53:04] Esau
[53:06] dead we we prove that back even with
[53:09] Cain Cain was not sure he was of that
[53:11] Wicked one sure Cain came from the
[53:14] serpent but his soul came from God
[53:18] Amen and his soul had a choice to choose
[53:22] the election right but God knew before
[53:25] the foundation of the world that it
[53:26] would be God one Satan two in Cain's
[53:30] purpose amen that's to me that's just
[53:33] very simple but he did it by what forn
[53:35] knowledge he forew everything that was
[53:38] going to go on so he predetermined or
[53:43] predestinated every bit of
[53:46] this cuz remember brother BR said he
[53:48] don't predestinate by his desires you
[53:49] know if he PR predestinate by's desire
[53:51] desires it wouldn't be a hell there
[53:52] wouldn't be a
[53:54] devil there wouldn't be nobody lost
[53:56] would be nobody
[53:58] sick but because he had attributes those
[54:00] had to be displayed being God infinite
[54:04] they had to be displayed and in order to
[54:06] be displayed he had to allow Satan to do
[54:08] what he did he had to allow allow you to
[54:12] choose which one you got the same Choice
[54:14] listen I spoke to many many people and
[54:17] people around the message oh you don't
[54:18] have a choice you just was born with
[54:20] this seed in you you know and it just
[54:22] you just come to life one day
[54:28] right what the
[54:30] world what's going
[54:32] on that ain't even sensible they'll tell
[54:35] you in the denominational world that you
[54:36] were
[54:37] lost and you needed
[54:39] salvation you needed somewhere to listen
[54:42] to somebody tell you about
[54:44] God and then God would come into your
[54:47] soul listen folks it's just like it's
[54:50] just like a man and a woman getting
[54:51] together to have a baby there's millions
[54:54] of little potential life every sperm is
[54:58] potential life but it's got to find that
[55:00] one egg right and when it finds that one
[55:04] egg one sperm one egg they all
[55:07] potentially are life every one of
[55:10] them but by election God knew which one
[55:13] would pick this one he remember brother
[55:16] Brown said he he bred this one to this
[55:17] one like Bob was talking about other
[55:19] night this one to get you here cuz there
[55:22] was a character he held that character
[55:25] back before the found foundational world
[55:27] he held that character right and that
[55:30] character that you have today if you're
[55:32] born again is not like God it is
[55:36] God and it's got to be of that one
[55:40] seed Not seeds as of many one seed which
[55:44] is Christ right always listen to brother
[55:46] Bri on me he's talking a little bit
[55:47] about marriage and divorce he had to
[55:49] bring that out marriage and divorce he
[55:50] said there's David 500
[55:53] wives but they only had one husband
[55:56] right
[55:57] Solomon had a thousand individual wives
[56:00] and hundreds of concubines I do not know
[56:03] how he got any work
[56:05] done but he had them but they only had
[56:09] one husband rightly same way with you
[56:11] and I we are a many membered body but
[56:14] we're only Born Again by
[56:17] one quickened right word listen Paul
[56:22] said the letter kth there's that all
[56:24] that dead all that dead stuff around us
[56:31] right whatever brought you here today
[56:34] whatever gave you the baptism of the
[56:36] Holy Ghost is that quickening word that
[56:38] God put in this Bible before the
[56:40] foundation of the world knowing you
[56:42] would need it by for knowledge he
[56:44] predetermined this Bible would be
[56:46] written exactly the way it's written and
[56:49] that you and I would respond to that
[56:51] very
[56:53] scripture I didn't respond to every one
[56:55] of them
[56:57] I can preach on Genesis 126 and some of
[57:00] you when somebody preaches on Genesis
[57:02] 126 I
[57:04] go give me some more but see if somebody
[57:08] preaches on Matthew 24:24 somebody else
[57:10] may
[57:11] go and somebody else may go really I
[57:14] mean that's why we're individuals that's
[57:16] why there were 66 books that's why
[57:18] there's thousands of scripture because
[57:20] you correspond the seed that brought you
[57:24] to life amen was put right
[57:27] here before the foundation of the world
[57:30] you
[57:31] cannot if you accepted it here you can't
[57:34] miss it right cuz he saw you accept it
[57:37] there amen amen he was looking down
[57:41] through time he also I'm not getting
[57:43] where I need to go he also did
[57:45] predestinate to be conformed to the
[57:48] image of his son that he might be the
[57:50] first born among many Brethren moreover
[57:55] whom he did pred now watch this is a
[57:57] string of events that cannot be broken
[58:01] Amen brother Lis the string of events
[58:04] that cannot this scripture cannot
[58:07] be broke and brought in some no it's got
[58:10] to be look moreover whom he did
[58:12] predestinate them he called why did he
[58:15] call because he saw you would
[58:18] respond exactly right and whom he
[58:21] called them he justified amen now be
[58:25] careful with that we'll talk about that
[58:27] I may get into that a little bit later
[58:29] on down the road but be careful with
[58:32] that because remember you can be
[58:34] justified and not be Sanctified right
[58:37] you can be justified and not have the
[58:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost right now
[58:41] here's the part that we thank God that
[58:45] he sent us a prophet to give us Insight
[58:47] because see the Baptist take that as
[58:50] eternal
[58:51] security I'm
[58:53] Justified I'm Justified so I'm all
[58:56] already glorified doesn't matter what I
[58:57] do I can drink smoke cuss to live with
[58:58] somebody
[59:00] else and I'm just saying those words
[59:02] because you know what it may be
[59:03] something else that you have a problem
[59:04] with I just say drink smoke curse and
[59:08] those things cuz a lot of us can relate
[59:10] to
[59:10] that okay now
[59:14] that them he also Justified there's a
[59:17] lot of people because the Bible says
[59:18] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[59:20] thou shalt be saved doesn't say you got
[59:21] to listen to the message or 20 sermons
[59:24] it says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:25] and thou sh be saved there's many people
[59:27] have raised their hands up and say God
[59:28] forgive me of my sins and he just
[59:31] Justified them that's but if you've not
[59:34] been taught any better guess what that
[59:36] other Spirit comes in remember there's
[59:39] two the true Spirit tells you yes I will
[59:43] justify you I wrote it in the word
[59:47] right and then Satan comes in and says
[59:49] okay sir you're fine
[59:51] then I mean I've been to many funeral
[59:54] and I'm not degrading anybody I'm just
[59:55] telling you this is the way that they've
[59:57] been taught the Baptist they we we you
[1:00:00] go to funerals and the guys hadn't been
[1:00:02] Church in 50
[1:00:05] years but he gave his heart to the Lord
[1:00:07] when he was
[1:00:08] nine but he ain't darkened the
[1:00:11] door and probably lived a hound dog life
[1:00:14] but the Baptist look back and say he was
[1:00:16] justified back here and that's okay if
[1:00:20] you believe that because if you truly
[1:00:23] believe you've been Justified you'll
[1:00:24] continue to read that scripture
[1:00:26] that's right those who he justified he's
[1:00:33] Sanctified listen
[1:00:35] folks even in this
[1:00:37] message it's a tough thing to preach the
[1:00:40] three stages of Grace right right they
[1:00:44] just think not even believe on the Lord
[1:00:47] Jesus Christ believe God sent a Prophet
[1:00:49] come on in don't cut your hair don't
[1:00:51] don't don't don't don't don't do do do
[1:00:52] don't don't don't don't and you're
[1:00:54] fine no
[1:00:57] because many
[1:00:58] people are like the foolish
[1:01:04] virgin that they got all cleaned
[1:01:07] up and they said well I must have the
[1:01:10] Holy
[1:01:12] Ghost cuz I don't do that
[1:01:16] anymore
[1:01:17] no no
[1:01:20] no
[1:01:21] no sanctification is a work of the Holy
[1:01:24] Ghost sanctification cleans
[1:01:27] you out right
[1:01:30] right but that place is still empty
[1:01:33] that's right right the Book of Luke
[1:01:34] tells us that unclean Spirit goes
[1:01:37] out drinking smoking cussing running
[1:01:39] around doing all those things and then
[1:01:41] you go I must have the Holy Ghost cuz
[1:01:43] this is not don't bother me
[1:01:45] anymore see that's where that second
[1:01:47] Spirit comes
[1:01:49] in now the really listen the first
[1:01:51] Spirit we're talking about God's holy
[1:01:53] spirit cleans you out see it's a work
[1:01:57] right those who is Justified is also
[1:02:00] Sanctified that's done by God Almighty
[1:02:02] Satan C cast out Satan right so there is
[1:02:06] a holy spirit that cleans you
[1:02:09] up and sets you aside for
[1:02:12] service but now if that other Spirit
[1:02:15] walks in and
[1:02:16] goes just stay right there y you're fine
[1:02:22] don't you feel good don't you feel like
[1:02:25] worshiping
[1:02:26] don't you feel like going to church
[1:02:28] every Sunday yeah don't you feel like
[1:02:30] don't you when you listen to the the
[1:02:33] message of the hour don't it just give
[1:02:34] you chills up your
[1:02:37] spine that's that second spirit because
[1:02:41] that Spirit right here
[1:02:44] says it's a string of events right not
[1:02:48] stopping at any of them that's
[1:02:50] right he called and whom he called he
[1:02:54] justified whom he justified we know he
[1:02:57] say already glorified but there's got to
[1:02:59] be sanctification in there we know that
[1:03:01] them he also glorified there's only one
[1:03:03] group of people going to make that right
[1:03:05] there amen because the foolish virgin
[1:03:08] stop after the Sanctified part and most
[1:03:11] of the people in The Message look at
[1:03:12] them now you can't tell me that person
[1:03:15] lives clean for 30
[1:03:18] years preaches the message with it all
[1:03:21] of his heart just like I'm trying to
[1:03:24] tonight and walks
[1:03:28] away now folks I'm not talking about a
[1:03:33] person but if that Spirit takes him away
[1:03:36] from what I see is
[1:03:38] light and I have the Holy Ghost that
[1:03:41] person can't have it right exactly he
[1:03:44] may be
[1:03:46] Sanctified but you know how many years
[1:03:48] he lived Sanctified 30 or 40 years and
[1:03:51] all of a sudden that unclean spirit
[1:03:54] says I don't
[1:03:56] he missed the date over here and he
[1:03:59] missed a this over here and and he
[1:04:02] missed it that's not God's
[1:04:05] spirit now listen here's the difference
[1:04:08] folks because that same Spirit can say
[1:04:10] that to
[1:04:13] you doesn't matter about having
[1:04:16] doubt because sometimes they may be able
[1:04:19] to literally prove that brother rown
[1:04:21] wasn't out there in a certain date I
[1:04:23] really don't care right amen
[1:04:27] I don't care cloud that's a
[1:04:32] sign Believers don't follow
[1:04:35] signs that sign follows the believer so
[1:04:38] that sign of that cloud follows me
[1:04:41] around knowing that God met brother
[1:04:43] brandham under that cloud in that cloud
[1:04:46] and then he opened a
[1:04:48] way he did brother brandham didn't open
[1:04:51] the way Christ opened the way through
[1:04:54] William brandham to open the book right
[1:04:57] to show it to me John and then I had to
[1:05:01] eat the book right the problem is people
[1:05:04] don't eat
[1:05:07] right or you know what Satan slips in
[1:05:09] and gives them another book oh
[1:05:13] yeah oh what do you mean uh I don't
[1:05:17] think he was right in this and lord
[1:05:19] they're tearing him apart how can the
[1:05:22] Holy Ghost tear that apart right when
[1:05:25] we're living by listen this light in US
[1:05:28] is not
[1:05:31] Darkness you got to believe that but you
[1:05:34] got to prove it by the word of
[1:05:37] God you know why this thing's gone 50 or
[1:05:40] 60 years this is exactly why exactly
[1:05:43] amen you look back then with all them
[1:05:45] people that were with brother Brandon
[1:05:46] back in the in the 60s they thought he
[1:05:49] was God oh yeah baptized in his name and
[1:05:52] you know what he was the closest thing
[1:05:54] they'll ever see of God without seeing
[1:05:55] God himself yeah I mean how would and
[1:05:59] and you got to you got to that's what
[1:06:00] I'm saying about those folks you say
[1:06:02] Well they're all lost all going to hell
[1:06:04] now I'm not telling that's not my
[1:06:07] business they were under another
[1:06:09] light they come out of Pentecost and
[1:06:13] they were looking at the signs of the
[1:06:15] Prophet not looking at the message with
[1:06:19] the signs right that doesn't make them
[1:06:21] lost
[1:06:23] folks amen cuz they were in another age
[1:06:25] this age required what the Pentecostal
[1:06:28] people requir got it but you and I are
[1:06:31] not in that age right you and I are not
[1:06:35] in that age you and I are in the age of
[1:06:38] the book being open Glory that we can
[1:06:40] look back and see yes God sent a prophet
[1:06:43] God spoke listen what about a man that
[1:06:45] walk up to you and say brother Dale you
[1:06:48] need to go up that Valley not that
[1:06:49] Valley cuz there'll be nine elk over
[1:06:52] here and and you can shoot one of them
[1:06:54] and then he goes over another brother
[1:06:55] and he said now don't be fishing over
[1:06:56] here you need to be fishing over here
[1:06:58] and then he tells them he said I know
[1:06:59] what you're thinking about me brother
[1:07:00] you need to stop think You' think that
[1:07:02] was God almost almost cuz see that's
[1:07:04] what Jesus did is what Jesus did Jesus
[1:07:06] told Peter said put your net on that
[1:07:08] side of the boat put your net on that
[1:07:11] side of the boat Peter you fishing over
[1:07:12] here Lord we've been fishing all night
[1:07:16] we ain't caught a thing he said just
[1:07:17] throw your net over I mean on the other
[1:07:20] side of the
[1:07:21] boat don't tell me all the fish had
[1:07:23] schooled over here and not over here
[1:07:25] they were
[1:07:27] created then you see brother brandham no
[1:07:31] squirrels all of a sudden there's
[1:07:32] creative act of God they're squirrels
[1:07:35] you would think he was God but see they
[1:07:37] were under that light and that light
[1:07:39] blinded some of them but you and I come
[1:07:42] out of that light and we can see and
[1:07:46] separate being true virgins wise virgins
[1:07:50] we can separate the two and say God did
[1:07:54] send a prophet but that God was in that
[1:07:56] Prophet is in you and me
[1:08:00] right those who is
[1:08:02] Justified he's also
[1:08:05] glorified now if you're born again
[1:08:07] tonight guess what you're already
[1:08:12] glorified well that don't make you happy
[1:08:14] okay I don't make you
[1:08:20] happy so let's look just a second and
[1:08:22] touch this crossing of the natural seed
[1:08:24] because we saw that
[1:08:26] Genesis 6 vers1 said they took unto them
[1:08:29] wives of which they chose I want to make
[1:08:33] that point because
[1:08:34] remember what are women in the
[1:08:38] Bible women are churches right women are
[1:08:43] brides brother Braham said one time he
[1:08:45] said there's been Brides brides churches
[1:08:47] Brides brides he said but there's going
[1:08:48] to come one right exactly now you and I
[1:08:51] see that's the that's the separating
[1:08:53] place that's me and you no many brides
[1:08:57] many churches but he had to put them
[1:08:59] away in divorcement he had to divorce
[1:09:01] them because what they were fooling
[1:09:03] around with another man they were
[1:09:05] fooling around with another Spirit
[1:09:08] right Israel went whing after other gods
[1:09:12] right but they took un them wives of all
[1:09:15] which they chose sons of God saw the
[1:09:18] daughters of men that they were fair and
[1:09:20] they took them wives they took them
[1:09:24] churches
[1:09:27] of what they chose denominational
[1:09:29] churches we'll look at in just a second
[1:09:31] and the Lord said my spirit shall not
[1:09:33] always strive with
[1:09:35] man for that he is also he also is flesh
[1:09:38] yet his days shall be 120 years there
[1:09:39] were giants in the earth in those days
[1:09:41] and after that when the sons of God came
[1:09:42] in un the daughters of
[1:09:44] men they bear children to them now
[1:09:47] remember what does that head up to in in
[1:09:50] Book of Revelations we got to go from
[1:09:52] this chapter to to Revelations where
[1:09:54] there's a
[1:09:57] and
[1:10:01] daughters they bear children unto them
[1:10:05] the same became Mighty Men which were of
[1:10:07] old men of renown many mighty men have
[1:10:10] came out of these denominational
[1:10:13] churches listen Billy Graham and Ora
[1:10:16] Roberts they were in a denomination but
[1:10:19] it was their time to do what they were
[1:10:21] to do amen right right many people in in
[1:10:25] the message ranks doesn't think that
[1:10:27] that oral Rob Roberts or Billy Graham
[1:10:29] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[1:10:31] disagree I disagree 100% I think they
[1:10:34] were god-filled men for the time that
[1:10:36] they could be in they saw what they
[1:10:38] could see because you know what when you
[1:10:40] take a prophet though William brandham
[1:10:44] knowing that was the two men not
[1:10:48] literally the two men that went to Sodom
[1:10:50] but the spirit of those two men that
[1:10:52] went to Sodom and what did they do they
[1:10:54] blinded the world world he said that was
[1:10:57] a modern Billy Graham and a modern Oral
[1:11:00] Roberts they went down to Sodom to this
[1:11:02] world and blinded now I know they
[1:11:04] brought out a group of their
[1:11:06] own but they blinded the other sodomites
[1:11:10] brother ROM said so they had a place in
[1:11:11] the words what I'm saying I believe
[1:11:13] Billy Graham and or Roberts will see
[1:11:15] them in glory
[1:11:17] amen but many people tell you no I don't
[1:11:20] think so but I don't listen to everybody
[1:11:23] so now look we talk about election look
[1:11:25] Galatians 3 3:16 Says now to Abraham and
[1:11:27] to Seed where the promises made he say
[1:11:30] not un seeds as of many but as of one
[1:11:33] and to thy seed which is Christ all
[1:11:36] right so not seeds as of many not as
[1:11:39] natural seed as we're going to see look
[1:11:41] these are all natural seed yeah natural
[1:11:44] people born on Earth by natural sex by
[1:11:47] by a sex desire accept this man right
[1:11:48] here and he was that Keystone that could
[1:11:51] tell me and you that our first birth we
[1:11:54] can deny that first first birth and take
[1:11:55] a second birth that's why Jesus said you
[1:11:58] must be born again Jacob didn't say you
[1:11:59] must be born again Moses didn't say you
[1:12:01] must be born again right cuz they didn't
[1:12:04] know anything about in New
[1:12:05] Birth blood of bulls and goats is what
[1:12:08] they were under they were under a
[1:12:09] covering cuz that's what God told him to
[1:12:11] do God told Abel make
[1:12:15] sacrifice not make candy canes and fruit
[1:12:19] and oranges and pears oh I'm telling you
[1:12:22] when you walked up though to that I
[1:12:24] believe
[1:12:26] he didn't just throw them vegetables up
[1:12:28] there he put the little red rip oranges
[1:12:31] over I mean apples over here he put the
[1:12:33] oranges here he put the bananas and
[1:12:35] maybe had it look probably look at the
[1:12:38] Catholic
[1:12:39] Church look at that thing that John
[1:12:42] admired in the Book of Revelation the
[1:12:44] prophet of God said that angel had to
[1:12:46] turn John away from that cuz he admired
[1:12:50] that why was beautiful right gold
[1:12:53] Cathedrals yeah look look at the color
[1:12:55] have you never watched some of the
[1:12:57] things on TV from that the Catholics
[1:12:58] have done Lis has probably been in a
[1:13:00] church some of you may have been in a
[1:13:02] cathedral my Heavens the purple is
[1:13:04] purple the blue is blue the yellow is
[1:13:07] yellow what it's what appealing to the
[1:13:10] eye but it's As
[1:13:13] Dead As the rock that it's laying
[1:13:17] on God is nowhere that is the mother
[1:13:20] that is the other Spirit I'm
[1:13:23] sorry brother but you got Cain and Abel
[1:13:26] you got Isaac and ishmail you got Jacob
[1:13:28] and Esau you got Moses and balum you
[1:13:31] know all the stories behind them I don't
[1:13:32] have to tell you the story Elijah and
[1:13:34] Ahab and Jesus and Judas now watch what
[1:13:37] happened though because this is where
[1:13:39] it's going to get a little
[1:13:41] tricky let's look at number four then
[1:13:44] I'll cuz what happened with remember
[1:13:46] Cain and Abel was a a complete
[1:13:50] contrast Cain was of the wicked one Cain
[1:13:52] left God he went out of the presence of
[1:13:54] God he killed Abel he was a murderer but
[1:13:57] watch it when he comes down though Moses
[1:14:00] and balum balum was only off just a
[1:14:02] little
[1:14:03] bit cuz what he said was true oh yeah
[1:14:07] but what he done to Israel was false
[1:14:09] that's the only part that's that see
[1:14:10] getting closer then you got Judas and
[1:14:13] Jesus for three and a half years Judas
[1:14:16] walked with Jesus every day preached the
[1:14:18] gospel cast out
[1:14:21] Devils Spirits were subject to us it
[1:14:25] they come back saying and there was
[1:14:28] Judas right among that group the Bible
[1:14:31] says in the book of Acts Judas had a
[1:14:33] part of the ministry right wow see that
[1:14:37] brought it back
[1:14:39] close and then you see that like I said
[1:14:41] before Paul says Grievious
[1:14:44] wolves are already
[1:14:46] here John says the spirit of antichrist
[1:14:50] is already working we read that in first
[1:14:52] John it had come back so much but
[1:14:56] watching the book of Acts though will
[1:14:58] you see it separate again it's what I
[1:15:01] was looking at the other day it's kind
[1:15:02] of like a wave but you see how Satan is
[1:15:05] he Satan is just so slick but he sees
[1:15:08] that book of Acts that powerful book of
[1:15:11] Acts boy nothing can stand in front of
[1:15:13] them folks amen Paul take cloths off of
[1:15:17] his body and Spirits were cast out we
[1:15:19] believe that we know that's where prayer
[1:15:22] CLA came the the not the idea I don't
[1:15:24] like the idea of prayer cloth it was in
[1:15:26] the Bible right cloths were on Paul they
[1:15:29] took cloths off of
[1:15:31] Paul no doubt they took cloth off of
[1:15:33] Paul and they said this was laying on
[1:15:36] the Apostle Paul and this is what he had
[1:15:40] and let me tell you about Paul Paul had
[1:15:42] the Holy Ghost so much till he could
[1:15:44] speak the word and it would happen he
[1:15:46] well the people said well I believe what
[1:15:48] he
[1:15:49] said God healed them on what they of
[1:15:51] what the problem they had and same way
[1:15:54] with each one all the you keep that you
[1:15:55] may need it but that's where this came
[1:15:58] from was Closs off of Paul
[1:16:02] right it comes down to now to where
[1:16:04] we've seen people
[1:16:06] healed we've seen uh people receive
[1:16:09] their sight we've seen people have
[1:16:12] babies we've seen PE whatever A lot of
[1:16:14] people are you just believe not the
[1:16:16] prayer cloth is what's behind it right
[1:16:19] it's the word of God that's behind it
[1:16:21] but you see now though in the book of
[1:16:22] Acts though it kind of separated
[1:16:26] Paul was casting that whatever it was
[1:16:28] the the that guy Barnabas or not
[1:16:30] Barnabas but the the sorcerer and all
[1:16:32] that you can see the separation and then
[1:16:34] brother randam said the first three
[1:16:36] Church Ages was there was no
[1:16:37] denomination in the first three Church
[1:16:39] ages there was not the pure word of
[1:16:41] God they were baptized in the name of
[1:16:44] Jesus Christ they were they were
[1:16:45] believing there was only one true and
[1:16:47] living God there was not these now they
[1:16:49] was little sayings we saw that in the
[1:16:51] seal
[1:16:52] book we see that in the seal book book
[1:16:55] right but what happened with the seal
[1:16:57] book brother bandam said it's been
[1:17:00] closed the book's been
[1:17:04] closed so they couldn't look on what
[1:17:06] we're looking on
[1:17:07] now the book was closed after the book
[1:17:10] of Acts and after Jesus left he came
[1:17:11] back though in power but what happened
[1:17:13] was is we'll read it in just a minute n
[1:17:17] we look preia Nan fathers what happened
[1:17:21] was it started coming back together
[1:17:26] you had the powerful word of God first
[1:17:28] three Church ages a white church but
[1:17:32] then you also had a white righteous
[1:17:33] church it was riding in the four horse
[1:17:36] riders was riding in that same time as a
[1:17:40] saying right what do you think it's like
[1:17:42] now how do you think all this got
[1:17:44] started with brother brandham and all
[1:17:45] this uh you don't have to go to church
[1:17:47] just listen to tapes it all started as a
[1:17:49] say hey don't
[1:17:52] you that that I don't I don't know if
[1:17:55] that date's right or brother Brown
[1:17:58] brother Brown must have been
[1:17:59] wrong um well I've been burnt so
[1:18:04] much with all these churches I think
[1:18:06] I'll just stay home and listen to
[1:18:13] T what kind of spirit is that right it
[1:18:16] can't be a Christlike spirit cuz Christ
[1:18:20] told us to go to church amen Christ told
[1:18:23] us to listen to a five-fold Ministry
[1:18:24] amen Christ didn't tell us to stay at
[1:18:26] home listen to tapes listen we listened
[1:18:29] to about six tapes the other day going
[1:18:30] to Illinois and back we as freely as we
[1:18:32] wanted to we kept mashing play right
[1:18:35] right that's right so we got six sermons
[1:18:37] instead of going to a place and sitting
[1:18:39] in a house and listening to half a
[1:18:40] sermon one morning and and never mind
[1:18:42] I'm not going to get off of that get off
[1:18:44] of
[1:18:45] that listen if you're deceived with that
[1:18:48] you are
[1:18:50] deceived to me that's not the deception
[1:18:54] of the a of the end time right because
[1:18:57] if you believe you can sit home and
[1:19:00] listen to tape and go in a Rapture you
[1:19:03] are being lied
[1:19:05] to by whoever told
[1:19:08] you that that was all right to do and it
[1:19:10] wasn't that person it was that Spirit
[1:19:12] motivating that person right everybody
[1:19:14] got that it was that Spirit motivating
[1:19:16] that person to tell you that cuz you
[1:19:17] know what God's got
[1:19:20] spokesman so does the devil yes sir and
[1:19:23] he don't POS them as alcoholics that
[1:19:26] walk through the door well bless God you
[1:19:29] ain't got to go to church no he sends
[1:19:31] you a nice guy with a vest on and a
[1:19:34] beautiful nice set of cuff links
[1:19:40] and and tells you
[1:19:44] that I know that we've listened to all
[1:19:46] this false and I know you've been hurt
[1:19:49] and you you let's just listen to tapes
[1:19:52] we know brother Brandon was right so
[1:19:54] let's just listen listen to what he
[1:19:56] said well that's
[1:19:58] okay but that's not all of it right the
[1:20:02] Bible says me and Jun we're talking
[1:20:04] about coming to church the Bible is our
[1:20:08] absolute that's right and I believe that
[1:20:10] the prophet of God matches the word of
[1:20:14] God so that makes the message message
[1:20:16] are absolute but if you take this part
[1:20:20] out Satan you've took one word
[1:20:27] right he might get me with something
[1:20:32] else brother Zach but he will not get me
[1:20:36] with that
[1:20:38] one I might let him get deceive me some
[1:20:41] other way but I'll promise you he will
[1:20:43] not deceive me with sitting at home and
[1:20:46] listening to tapes and not going to
[1:20:47] church right cuz that's not in me so
[1:20:50] let's look at this right
[1:20:53] here and studying through many books of
[1:20:55] the history of the church h two bons you
[1:20:57] probably studied it in Fox's book of
[1:20:58] Martyrs and the prean council Nan
[1:21:01] fathers we're going to cover that in a
[1:21:03] minute I don't know if I'm going to get
[1:21:04] to 10 virgins but I will next Tuesday
[1:21:07] night if I don't you go back and find
[1:21:08] out that every Spirit In the Land look
[1:21:11] every every spirit in this land and
[1:21:16] every cult and everything he covers it
[1:21:19] all if you go back it began in Genesis
[1:21:23] right it's coming up though look it's
[1:21:26] coming up to a blooming time a
[1:21:28] blossoming time so in other words the
[1:21:31] seed was planted in
[1:21:33] Genesis but when is the Harvest time
[1:21:36] it's now cuz he's letting the seed grow
[1:21:39] he's letting it show its colors he's
[1:21:40] letting it get to maturity to show
[1:21:42] either he's wheat seed or he's
[1:21:45] cleur you see them come out like Cain
[1:21:48] and Abel now watch he brings them two
[1:21:49] together now and watch these two boys
[1:21:52] come right down to be Judas and Jesus he
[1:21:54] put right back together all right and
[1:21:57] just right on through didn't stop
[1:21:59] there it comes right on out into
[1:22:05] today this last day where the Antichrist
[1:22:09] and the Christ
[1:22:11] spirit so close it had deceive the very
[1:22:15] elect if possible now we're taught that
[1:22:18] and we know that's true right pretty
[1:22:20] good quote I like that one all right
[1:22:23] let's go we know that's true because
[1:22:26] what happened look we'll do number five
[1:22:27] right here leave it right
[1:22:28] there cuz what happened was if Satan
[1:22:33] knew he
[1:22:35] couldn't get God's
[1:22:41] church with a Doctrine so far
[1:22:47] off I mean what if somebody walked in
[1:22:49] here and said okay well you know we can
[1:22:51] we can have six wives and it doesn't
[1:22:53] matter we you we let's just go back
[1:22:55] smoking again and you know that was a it
[1:22:58] was a a Doctrine in the message we know
[1:23:00] that it come out of Jamaica some of it
[1:23:02] was that we were already in the
[1:23:03] Millennium and so it didn't M this was
[1:23:06] the soul was in the Millennium so our
[1:23:08] soul some way was transferred over here
[1:23:10] into the Millennium yeah now really but
[1:23:14] this is still here but what we do here
[1:23:18] is not going to affect over
[1:23:20] here now that was the doctrine from the
[1:23:23] message so they go out and divorce their
[1:23:26] wife get them two or three more this is
[1:23:29] the truth smoke cigarettes drink beer
[1:23:33] because it's not going to matter about
[1:23:34] this one cuz what is inside of is
[1:23:36] already over here in the Millennium you
[1:23:38] know so holy and
[1:23:41] pass now what kind of Doctrine is that
[1:23:43] going to fool you but you know what it
[1:23:44] done it fooled a bunch of people to
[1:23:46] begin
[1:23:48] with because you know why they didn't
[1:23:50] have the Holy Ghost right and not having
[1:23:53] the Holy Ghost you will go to fleshly
[1:23:55] sensation every time why did they go
[1:23:57] back and start doing what they used to
[1:23:59] do
[1:24:00] right cuz the unclean Spirit went out
[1:24:03] but when he came back he brought seven
[1:24:05] other buddies with him that were worse
[1:24:08] the Bible says than that one which made
[1:24:11] them very religious but then all of a
[1:24:12] sudden they come up and say well I you
[1:24:15] know I can't I can't run around on my
[1:24:17] wife being under this
[1:24:19] Doctrine Satan says well that's okay
[1:24:22] you're already in the Millennium your
[1:24:23] soul is the the Bible tells you you
[1:24:25] you've risen sitting in Heavenly places
[1:24:27] in Christ and even the prophet tells you
[1:24:29] that we're living you know sitting in
[1:24:30] Heavenly places we're in another
[1:24:32] dimension yeah so it doesn't matter what
[1:24:35] this guy does and then the flesh goes oh
[1:24:37] okay all right yeah back to what we used
[1:24:41] to do before now the Holy Ghost will not
[1:24:43] do that right so don't think that's a
[1:24:45] true Doctrine I told them you know many
[1:24:47] times before I told you I said let me
[1:24:48] have one of them guys I'm going to take
[1:24:50] him down to the zoo and throw him into
[1:24:51] the lion's den and find out if we're in
[1:24:53] the Millennium cuz the Bible says that
[1:24:55] they'll eat
[1:24:59] grass they wouldn't they'd find out real
[1:25:01] quick we wasn't in the
[1:25:03] Millennium but that was a Doctrine and
[1:25:06] people believed it and churches yes this
[1:25:08] just find funny was it take throw that
[1:25:10] Jokers over in the lon there and say eat
[1:25:21] grass that's when they that other spirit
[1:25:24] their Spirits would
[1:25:26] divide but see you see how that that's
[1:25:28] deceiving because what did it do they
[1:25:30] didn't have the Holy Ghost as a TI poost
[1:25:32] how many times have you heard a sermon
[1:25:33] that you didn't see that was right how
[1:25:35] many times that thing down inside of you
[1:25:39] go something's wrong with that something
[1:25:43] something's not right with that you know
[1:25:45] what that's that Holy Ghost right that's
[1:25:48] in your soul not just in your spirit
[1:25:50] realm that's why as Bible saying the
[1:25:52] other night you can have the baptism of
[1:25:54] the Holy Ghost every day of your life on
[1:25:56] your spirit now and die and go to hell
[1:26:00] and your spirit is memory reason
[1:26:01] conscious affection imagination you can
[1:26:02] have all that and you can still die and
[1:26:04] go to hell why because the inside guy is
[1:26:06] still black right the people that say
[1:26:09] have I not done this have I not done
[1:26:11] that have I not cast out Devils have I
[1:26:13] not done these Mighty Works they had the
[1:26:16] Holy Ghost on their spirit and God
[1:26:19] worked through that through them and I
[1:26:22] would say people miraculous were healed
[1:26:24] and all these different things cuz he
[1:26:25] said he cast out devils and all these
[1:26:27] different things but that inside guy was
[1:26:30] still dirty
[1:26:32] right so let's get right here and then
[1:26:34] I'll tell you what we'll quit and we'll
[1:26:36] take up the 10
[1:26:38] virgins next week because you your 10
[1:26:40] virgins are there's your two Spirits
[1:26:42] right you wise and your foolish there's
[1:26:45] your wise spirit and your foolish Spirit
[1:26:47] but they all come under the framework
[1:26:49] remember what brother Brown said the
[1:26:50] framework of the Christian
[1:26:52] Church a foolish virgin is in the
[1:26:54] framework of the Christian church right
[1:26:57] cuz he's Sanctified that's right people
[1:26:59] out there don't know anything but people
[1:27:00] out there think sanctification and
[1:27:02] they're done they're saved and all this
[1:27:03] other things listen folks I'm telling
[1:27:05] you when I got when I come to the Lord
[1:27:08] and I ask him to forgive me of my sins I
[1:27:10] believe he did that but I was well
[1:27:12] taught in that I knew that when I went
[1:27:14] to sanctification and I quit dipping
[1:27:16] I'll just tell you this I quit
[1:27:19] dipping I quit
[1:27:22] lusting I didn't smoke any but I dipped
[1:27:25] a lot I quit
[1:27:28] drinking and there several other things
[1:27:30] that you don't need to know about they
[1:27:32] were all cast out but I knew I didn't
[1:27:35] have the Holy Ghost sister Trudy I knew
[1:27:38] that was not the Holy Ghost but now 99%
[1:27:42] of the people that have never been
[1:27:43] taught would have said I am now born
[1:27:46] again and Satan would have said yep
[1:27:48] you're right yeah he would have stepped
[1:27:50] right in there and said what yep yep
[1:27:52] you're born again you listen to a couple
[1:27:54] tapes and go to church and Nod your head
[1:27:56] every once in a
[1:27:59] while no but when you have that
[1:28:02] experience though when that thing gets
[1:28:05] down on the inside of the inside and
[1:28:08] start speaking and when you start
[1:28:09] reading God starts putting that puzzle
[1:28:12] together just like
[1:28:13] this and when you not just see that
[1:28:16] ladies don't wear pants no you go to the
[1:28:21] Bible you see what spirit is behind that
[1:28:25] all the other spirits that are behind
[1:28:27] these things and then you I told you I
[1:28:31] could explain serpent seed when I was 14
[1:28:32] years old I knew it wasn't an apple it
[1:28:36] just made sense what it was I was 14 I
[1:28:39] was going through
[1:28:40] puberty I knew what it was I knew what
[1:28:43] my problem
[1:28:44] was right but see I only had the natural
[1:28:51] part brother Brown said a lot of these
[1:28:53] things is just ability to read that's
[1:28:55] right
[1:28:57] right but go 20 years later now I know
[1:29:02] that that serpent seed's still working
[1:29:03] right here and I know why the two
[1:29:05] Spirits had to be here and I know all
[1:29:07] this and I could put the quotes together
[1:29:09] and I could see how God was doing things
[1:29:11] because remember with the baptism of the
[1:29:12] Holy Ghost you have Insight that you
[1:29:14] didn't have
[1:29:15] before everybody okay with that see
[1:29:18] that's why I know I moved into the
[1:29:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost is because not
[1:29:21] only did I quit those things I even got
[1:29:24] tested on them certain times I'll tell
[1:29:26] you remember one time before I was going
[1:29:28] down the road talking to this friend of
[1:29:29] mine and I mean he was talking about
[1:29:30] hunting and we were just all excited
[1:29:32] about going and I almost said that
[1:29:35] word but you remember my testimony I was
[1:29:38] driving the car and it felt like it felt
[1:29:40] like the airbag went off
[1:29:43] yeah I was fixing to say the s word and
[1:29:46] when it did Brother John something went
[1:29:48] and when it hit me right there I went oh
[1:29:51] yeah that's all I said I couldn't say no
[1:29:53] more
[1:29:54] yeah God wasn't going to let me do
[1:29:57] it cuz I knew that word was coming out
[1:30:00] slipping up I didn't mean to say it but
[1:30:03] just caught up in a moment but when he
[1:30:04] went like that right there it's like I
[1:30:08] went and you know what I did I told my
[1:30:10] buddy I said I got to
[1:30:12] go and I hung that phone up and I cried
[1:30:15] like a baby I said God you said that
[1:30:19] you'd take that away from me
[1:30:24] and even in a
[1:30:25] test even in a
[1:30:28] test I was going to say it listen folks
[1:30:31] brother random said I was going to shoot
[1:30:33] that
[1:30:34] boy I was going to shoot that
[1:30:40] bull I was going to shoot
[1:30:43] myself you see what kind of spirit can
[1:30:46] get on you but what happened though that
[1:30:48] inside of the inside Glory that's what
[1:30:51] held exctly brother R did your religion
[1:30:55] did you hold on to your religion he said
[1:30:57] no he said My Religion help me
[1:31:02] amen be still and
[1:31:05] know that I am
[1:31:07] god let's read this quote right here and
[1:31:09] then we'll stop musicians get ready to
[1:31:13] come the pergan church age
[1:31:16] Jeffersonville watch this cuz we're
[1:31:18] going to talk about the white righteous
[1:31:20] church cuz you got to with Matthew 25
[1:31:22] talking about the kingdom of God being
[1:31:24] like an under 10 virgins so let's listen
[1:31:26] to what the prophet said now in doing
[1:31:27] this remember the book of Acts it was it
[1:31:30] was it was just rotness and then you had
[1:31:32] the great powerful book of Acts through
[1:31:35] irenius and Martin you had many signs
[1:31:38] wonders and great things going on the
[1:31:40] pure word of God was being spread around
[1:31:41] the world so you had that separation
[1:31:44] again right but watch what happened at n
[1:31:48] you got Constantine brother Brown which
[1:31:50] said was a scoundrel he was no Christian
[1:31:53] worldly guy he brings church and state
[1:31:57] together and he marries
[1:31:59] them in a union that started every
[1:32:03] denomination by name and every doc false
[1:32:07] Doctrine started right here right but
[1:32:10] watch the true church went to NAA to try
[1:32:13] to stop it but watch this right here now
[1:32:16] in doing this they Consolidated and made
[1:32:18] the early form the early Catholic church
[1:32:20] later then at the first great Nan
[1:32:22] Council now remember they one at 325 ad
[1:32:25] and one at 606 it took them 300 years to
[1:32:27] develop this from a saying to a deed to
[1:32:31] a Doctrine everybody got that that's
[1:32:33] what happened in the church age I mean
[1:32:34] in the seal book brother R said it
[1:32:36] started as a saying became a deed became
[1:32:38] a Doctrine this is the saying part the
[1:32:41] great Nan Council had taken place in ad
[1:32:43] 325 see that was 300 years after Christ
[1:32:47] left look what happened all of them was
[1:32:50] brought together the Bishops and fathers
[1:32:52] of the Christian faith that's us
[1:32:55] remember we're supposed to be turned
[1:32:57] back to the faith of our faith of the
[1:32:58] fathers right so here was the Christian
[1:33:01] fathers was brought together at NAA
[1:33:04] that's the reason it's called the Nia
[1:33:06] Council in ad 3:25 and about 15500
[1:33:10] delegates came to the convention or the
[1:33:13] council about 1500 delegates and the
[1:33:15] leoty outnumbered the Bishops 5 to one
[1:33:21] yeah wow in the delegation but yet
[1:33:26] through the nicians the cold Formals in
[1:33:29] other words that other
[1:33:32] spirit and Constantine's political
[1:33:35] political plan they outvoted the true
[1:33:39] church talk about election they outvoted
[1:33:41] the true church and won the Victory and
[1:33:43] issued in Bishops and holy orders of men
[1:33:46] taking the Holy Spirit from the meeting
[1:33:48] and placing it upon Bishops Cardinals
[1:33:50] popes and so forth
[1:33:54] here it comes back together and you're
[1:33:55] not going to be able to tell any
[1:33:56] difference now because everybody if you
[1:33:58] read kids if you had any kind of History
[1:34:01] lesson Constantine was this great
[1:34:03] warrior Constantine was this great
[1:34:06] crossback I mean he he was this great
[1:34:08] Christian Warrior listen truth be known
[1:34:11] he's the one that started killing 68
[1:34:13] million of our people right cuz they
[1:34:16] wasn't conformed to this new idea this
[1:34:19] new this new Seed doctrine
[1:34:24] so he killed them that's why you had
[1:34:27] your first church age or your first
[1:34:29] horse rider was a white righteous church
[1:34:31] he HD
[1:34:32] himself then what happened in the fourth
[1:34:35] Church age he became a red horse right
[1:34:39] physically killed 68 million of our
[1:34:42] people under what under not that well
[1:34:46] we're Christians and I mean we're
[1:34:47] barbarians and you're Christians so
[1:34:49] we're just going to kill you no it was
[1:34:51] Christians fighting Christians is what
[1:34:53] the world looked that right but what was
[1:34:55] it brother Brown said he said to look at
[1:34:56] him and
[1:34:57] said if you don't believe our Holy
[1:34:59] Father and you don't believe our Bishops
[1:35:01] we're going to kill you recant or die
[1:35:03] right right and they didn't recant and
[1:35:06] that's why 68 million of them of our
[1:35:10] people like I said the Holy Ghost filled
[1:35:11] people got killed in the Dark Ages by
[1:35:14] what that other spirit because look the
[1:35:16] Holy Spirit don't fight the Holy Spirit
[1:35:18] you can't do that exactly right like
[1:35:20] brother BR said bride does not fight
[1:35:23] bride
[1:35:24] right but the red horse and you see the
[1:35:26] White Horse the red horse the black
[1:35:28] horse musicians come and The Pale Horse
[1:35:31] listen it was four powers but one man
[1:35:35] exactly he gets off of this horse and
[1:35:38] gets on another
[1:35:41] right his
[1:35:43] name is the devil right his name is a
[1:35:48] demon right
[1:35:58] let's stand our
[1:36:01] feet I we'll get into the 10 virgins
[1:36:04] next Tuesday that okay everybody all
[1:36:06] right with that had a good time tonight
[1:36:09] you have a good time tonight amen amen
[1:36:12] amen all right listen June just got a
[1:36:15] message from Sister Janet Helm I don't
[1:36:16] know this person but an urgent prayer
[1:36:18] request for Kim Johnson's son who was 22
[1:36:21] years old to come oh that her well her
[1:36:25] son either may have taken his life or
[1:36:27] tried to oh so not sure of the
[1:36:30] outcome yet so let's pray real quick
[1:36:34] that the Lord will intervene on that
[1:36:35] situation dear heavenly father we pray
[1:36:37] Lord as a congregation Lord we just
[1:36:39] heard your word father and we know that
[1:36:41] it's true and your word is true father
[1:36:44] so now Lord take that word and the power
[1:36:47] behind it and send it send it to Sister
[1:36:49] Kim's son Lord that you'll raise him up
[1:36:52] Lord and give him a chance Lord at least
[1:36:54] to accept you father and Lord just bring
[1:36:57] him out of whatever situation he's in
[1:36:59] something caused that boy to do that
[1:37:01] some Spirit some evil demon tried to
[1:37:04] cause him to take his life father
[1:37:05] because we know you don't ever ever want
[1:37:09] people to take their life father because
[1:37:10] you are the Prince of Peace you are the
[1:37:12] king of life and we pray Lord in Jesus
[1:37:15] name that you'll intervene in that
[1:37:16] situation Lord in Jesus name amen amen I
[1:37:20] was thinking the other day we were
[1:37:22] listening to brother brandom and I
[1:37:23] thought you know
[1:37:25] Lord there's a power
[1:37:28] folks and and and I'm not we can't
[1:37:32] conjure anything up we're not conjurers
[1:37:34] that's what the devil does but there's a
[1:37:37] power laying in us that we're not using
[1:37:39] right there's something L there but
[1:37:42] there's something stopping it right
[1:37:45] there's something holding it back
[1:37:47] there's something that we've just not
[1:37:48] kind of got over that little
[1:37:51] hump cuz brother Bram said we go to come
[1:37:53] into speaking condition now what is
[1:37:56] speaking condition knowing what he wants
[1:37:59] and when he wants it right not what you
[1:38:01] want exactly cuz see Power without
[1:38:05] character is satanic you'll say the
[1:38:07] wrong thing like Elisha did and
[1:38:11] 42 kids got
[1:38:13] killed because you know what God honored
[1:38:15] the word of Elisha CU he was in a
[1:38:17] position listen folks we going to come
[1:38:19] to a place to where God is going to be
[1:38:21] satisfied with what we're going to
[1:38:25] when listen it's just got to be the same
[1:38:27] way when Adam was in the garden and he
[1:38:29] started saying elephant lion bear tiger
[1:38:33] God was going saying the same thing I'm
[1:38:35] saying the same thing I'm saying the
[1:38:36] same thing that's my son he's saying the
[1:38:38] same thing I'm saying amen that's what
[1:38:40] we got to come back to and Jesus never
[1:38:42] had a thought outside of what the father
[1:38:45] gave him
[1:38:47] right oh he may have had human thoughts
[1:38:49] but he said I do nothing right I do
[1:38:53] nothing exactly nothing without the
[1:38:55] father telling me what to do he was so
[1:38:58] in tune within the man inside of him
[1:39:01] listen folks you and I got the same Holy
[1:39:04] Ghost right and it can do the same thing
[1:39:07] for me and you let's pray that this
[1:39:10] thing is going to break I was thinking
[1:39:11] the other day just one more thought
[1:39:13] think with me this whole
[1:39:16] year has been nothing but about flesh
[1:39:20] that's right this guy the guy it's been
[1:39:24] all the whole 12 months has been nothing
[1:39:27] but flesh moaning and groaning right
[1:39:30] with the viruses and even not the
[1:39:31] viruses but you know what there's people
[1:39:33] that that are um being affected and not
[1:39:36] even the virus hitting them because of
[1:39:38] suicides that went up and all these
[1:39:40] different things cuz people are losing
[1:39:41] their mind people can't get regular I
[1:39:44] mean how many of you have you had to
[1:39:45] cancel just general things you had to go
[1:39:47] to the doctor for cuz I believe in going
[1:39:49] to doctors if you got something wrong
[1:39:50] with your car you take it to the
[1:39:51] mechanic right if you got something
[1:39:53] wrong with your body you go see the
[1:39:54] mechanic not even crying out to God you
[1:39:57] go see
[1:39:58] right but this year has been all about
[1:40:01] our natural human body exactly trying
[1:40:05] our best to make it through this year
[1:40:08] alive in our Humanity in our human body
[1:40:12] so folks there's only one thing left for
[1:40:14] the
[1:40:15] bride and that's a spiritual
[1:40:18] Revival that's one that's the spirit is
[1:40:21] going to take over the flesh yeah
[1:40:23] and something Supernatural is going to
[1:40:25] happen this year coming up you just wait
[1:40:27] and see you wait and see we've had Satan
[1:40:29] has listen what's Satan got Satan has
[1:40:31] tried to get in the soul he's tried to
[1:40:33] get in your soul he's tried to get in
[1:40:34] your soul he can't get in so he says oh
[1:40:37] flesh I I'll make them Curse God I'll
[1:40:41] make them get on their hands and knees
[1:40:43] and say there's not a God or God don't
[1:40:45] answer his
[1:40:48] prayer brother Claude you know he called
[1:40:50] had those gall stones he said I was or
[1:40:52] yeah g Stones he said I laying on the
[1:40:53] floor of the hospital begging God to
[1:40:56] kill me okay begging God to
[1:40:59] die and he said God just give
[1:41:03] him
[1:41:05] peace they didn't take it
[1:41:07] away but you know what he went he's
[1:41:09] through it right he's through it now
[1:41:12] back preaching he's back doing what he
[1:41:14] needs to do yeah so
