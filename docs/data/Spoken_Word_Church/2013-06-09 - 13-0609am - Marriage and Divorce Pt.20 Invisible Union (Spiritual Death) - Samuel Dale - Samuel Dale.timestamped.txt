[1:27] good to see everybody in the house of
[1:28] the lord if you like turn in your
[1:30] scriptures turn back where we've been
[1:31] reading in
[1:32] romans 7
[1:34] and we'll
[1:36] continue our thoughts
[1:42] now remember
[1:43] to the
[1:45] brothers and things you see this evening
[1:47] we're supposed to meet for a little bit
[1:49] kind of find out what everybody's got to
[1:51] bring and what to do and and all to
[1:54] going to the father's day
[1:56] uh time that we're having this
[1:58] thursday friday and saturday
[2:01] and we pray that the lord bless if you
[2:03] want to come up and eat with us we
[2:04] always have plenty of
[2:06] food and things and you know even if you
[2:08] don't want to fish come on up and we can
[2:10] sit around by the campfire
[2:12] i don't generally do a lot of fishing
[2:13] anyway so there's always somebody there
[2:16] to talk to
[2:17] and just come up and be with us and
[2:20] we'll be talking about that this evening
[2:22] but just remember now to you
[2:24] with the children and all make sure that
[2:26] you bring them drinks snacks and things
[2:28] of what you want them to to eat and to
[2:31] drink and all and of course you know
[2:34] they always get out there and get to
[2:35] running and going so we make sure we've
[2:37] got plenty of water and things like that
[2:40] and we supply the
[2:42] the like tea and stuff like that and
[2:44] orange juice and all but just drinks
[2:47] that you want to want them to drink and
[2:50] and all to make sure you send them with
[2:52] them and snacks and things to do and we
[2:55] always try to do everything we can in
[2:57] the correct order we try to obey all the
[2:59] laws and things uh you know if there's
[3:02] any of you that would be 16 you've got
[3:04] to have a hunting i mean a fishing
[3:06] license
[3:07] so make sure everybody understands that
[3:09] don't come up and think you can't get
[3:10] them up there they don't have them
[3:12] attached to a tree you have to kind of
[3:14] get them here you know so you know do
[3:17] that and make sure you do
[3:18] and you know when we try to obey all the
[3:20] laws and and things and clean up and and
[3:24] do everything and we we do that it's a
[3:26] good job of of doing everybody helps and
[3:28] works and and all like that but just
[3:30] remember those things uh we help the
[3:33] children
[3:34] try to catch theirs but we don't catch
[3:35] their limit
[3:37] you know that's that's not according to
[3:39] the law you're not supposed to help
[3:40] somebody else get their limits you're
[3:42] supposed to catch your limit and that's
[3:44] when i go if i get one fish
[3:47] i don't want nobody else catching me
[3:49] seven more to give to me because that's
[3:51] against the law so we need to to make
[3:53] sure that we follow all the laws and the
[3:55] things and and obey all of that you know
[3:58] because we're trying to set an example
[3:59] in front of the children
[4:01] to where they would do but we you know
[4:03] we get out there and we flip over for
[4:06] them and hand them to rod and you know
[4:07] and let the kids pull them in and and
[4:10] and i do that i have more fun doing that
[4:12] than than i do even trying to catch one
[4:14] myself because when you see them little
[4:16] ones
[4:18] there's an excitement going on so you
[4:20] know we do all of that but make sure now
[4:23] one thing make sure that you send some
[4:25] extra clothes
[4:27] because the kids always get wet
[4:29] and it may be cool you know so make sure
[4:32] you send some extra clothes shoes
[4:34] or something
[4:38] and a little jacket or something because
[4:39] it gets cool at night
[4:41] they're in the mountains i mean make
[4:42] sure you you do that and you know we
[4:44] have a campfire but it generally gets
[4:46] cool sitting around and talking and
[4:49] doing and all like that so just make
[4:51] sure you do those things uh
[4:53] anything else you might want to bring
[4:55] your little
[4:56] light jacket that's waterproof or
[4:58] something because it may be raining
[5:00] something and all of this thing just
[5:02] remember that we'll be talking about it
[5:03] this afternoon
[5:05] and and doing it all right
[5:06] any other announcements uh
[5:10] brother
[5:11] richard went by to see i talked to him
[5:13] this morning brother wilson he went by
[5:15] to see brother bill younce and said he
[5:16] was doing better and really coming along
[5:19] good he still swelled up and things but
[5:21] still doing and that they were able to
[5:24] you know cap off the trach
[5:27] and he could talk some but they didn't
[5:29] want him to do much
[5:30] you know because they didn't want no
[5:32] problems
[5:33] but you know they're they're getting in
[5:35] at least working into some things and
[5:38] just keep praying for him and the lord
[5:39] would bless him and bring him on out of
[5:41] these things and and all like that
[5:43] anything else i always forget something
[5:50] heavenly father we thank you for this
[5:52] day and your love unto us we thank you
[5:54] for calvary
[5:55] thank you for loving us and caring for
[5:57] us
[5:58] and lord knowing that you are god and
[6:00] you change not then we can depend upon
[6:03] you to keep your word
[6:04] and then that way we can just stand up
[6:06] on the word and we can believe the word
[6:08] and and honor it and keep it and try to
[6:11] walk in you we ask you to bless each one
[6:13] remember the sick among us because you
[6:15] said you sent your word and healed us
[6:17] and delivered us from destruction so we
[6:20] know that there's many needs here
[6:21] spiritual needs physical needs
[6:24] financial needs maybe lord we pray that
[6:27] you would just bless each one bless the
[6:29] the internet people the system as
[6:31] they're listening
[6:32] and lord may they understand that we're
[6:35] just trying to continue on in you and to
[6:38] walk in the light of your love we love
[6:40] you and we thank you forgive our sins
[6:43] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[6:45] guide us in jesus name amen
[6:49] he'll go with romans
[6:53] 7
[6:57] no you're not brethren for i speak to
[6:59] them that know the law
[7:01] have the law have dominion over a man as
[7:03] long as he liveth
[7:04] for the woman which hath and husband is
[7:06] bound by the law to her husband now he
[7:09] sees illustrating
[7:11] what he's just said
[7:14] that the law
[7:15] as long as you and i are alive we're
[7:17] under the law
[7:18] you can claim all you want to
[7:20] but if you're still alive you're under
[7:22] the law
[7:23] the world's still under the law today
[7:25] you can't get people to see that
[7:26] especially you know
[7:29] a denominational people are
[7:30] denominational ideas he was oh no the
[7:33] law ended at calvary we're not under law
[7:35] we're under grace no let's don't make it
[7:37] disgrace
[7:38] unless you're born again
[7:41] you're still under the law
[7:43] if you're born again then you're dead
[7:46] this is the best way to say it so then
[7:49] paul's showing it but nay's illustrating
[7:51] it see
[7:52] he's not just picking on women he's
[7:54] illustrating what he's saying how does
[7:56] the law have dominion over a man as long
[7:58] as he liveth
[8:00] now the illustrated scene
[8:02] for the one which hath and husband is
[8:04] bound by the law to her husband as long
[8:06] as he liveth
[8:07] but if the husband be dead she is loose
[8:09] from the law of her husband
[8:11] see why because we're talking about the
[8:13] bride of christ
[8:15] not just a natural thing we've been
[8:17] through those things
[8:20] so then if while her husband liveth
[8:22] she'd be married to another man she
[8:23] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[8:25] husband be dead she is free from that
[8:27] law
[8:28] so that she is no adulteress though she
[8:30] be married to another man wherefore my
[8:32] brother and you also are become dead to
[8:34] the law
[8:35] by what the body of christ that you
[8:38] should be married to another even to him
[8:41] who is raised from the dead that we
[8:43] should bring forth fruit under god
[8:45] for when we were in the flesh the
[8:47] motions of sin which were by the law
[8:50] did work in our members to bring forth
[8:52] fruit unto death but now we are
[8:54] delivered from the law that being dead
[8:57] were in we were hell that we should
[8:59] serve in newness of spirit
[9:02] and not in the oldness of the letter you
[9:05] may be seated the lord had his
[9:06] blessing to the
[9:08] reading of the word
[9:11] now i know we
[9:14] are putting quite a bit of time into
[9:17] the thoughts and things of what we're
[9:18] doing and
[9:20] you know i want to do that but
[9:22] you know sometimes when company comes in
[9:25] and different things happens
[9:26] you just have to kind of
[9:29] do the best you can
[9:31] and move on you know in the lord and
[9:33] that way it gives everybody a chance to
[9:36] understand
[9:37] but now we've been talking about
[9:41] we went through the marriage and divorce
[9:44] message going through and covering the
[9:46] different things and and all that the
[9:48] prophet had to say on it then we started
[9:51] into the message called the invisible
[9:53] union
[9:54] all right in that message then the
[9:56] prophet
[9:57] covers
[9:58] these things of how that we
[10:01] must die and all this and the other and
[10:04] but the thing that i'm wanting you to do
[10:06] is just keep reading that book until you
[10:08] begin to realize
[10:09] that you're looking at a man
[10:11] that is uh time running out because that
[10:14] was what he was saying
[10:16] you know he leaves out west he's heading
[10:18] back to jeffersonville
[10:20] and
[10:21] as he's coming back you know he's killed
[10:23] on the earth struck on the road guys the
[10:25] hospital later
[10:26] but yet he's running out of time
[10:29] and he's trying to pack in all he can
[10:32] so he goes
[10:33] and speaks there
[10:35] at the church
[10:37] and you know
[10:38] puts out a lot of things
[10:41] but what i'm wanting you to see is that
[10:43] there's a threefold
[10:44] revelation or he covers three things
[10:48] in the
[10:49] invisible union first the new birth
[10:54] all right secondly the marriage in
[10:56] divorce to the point that he could cover
[10:59] out there as being respectable
[11:02] to them you know and in their doings
[11:05] and then he covers law and grace
[11:08] all right so that's why we've been using
[11:10] it as a three-fold
[11:12] uh revelation
[11:13] and we've taken two messages already on
[11:15] the first fold and should take about 30
[11:18] but trying to cut down to
[11:21] get you to understand
[11:23] because if you read that message you'll
[11:25] see the answer to a lot of questions
[11:28] if you'll just read the invisible union
[11:30] over and over and over you'll see a lot
[11:32] of answers
[11:33] that the prophet placed within there
[11:36] and how he was showing or illustrating
[11:39] you know
[11:40] and he said i'm not talking about you
[11:42] women
[11:45] he said whatever you are between you and
[11:47] god that's you
[11:48] he said i'm talking about christ in the
[11:51] church
[11:52] all right so when he's saying as i said
[11:54] when he covers romans 7 1
[11:57] he shows that
[11:59] that as long as a man is alive
[12:02] he's under the law
[12:05] and that's what i said that's hard to
[12:06] get people to even consider or think
[12:08] about
[12:10] because we've been taught all of our
[12:11] life
[12:13] that the law ended at calvary
[12:17] you know
[12:18] well it did
[12:19] to those that are born again
[12:22] to those who get born again the law
[12:24] ended there because that's where he paid
[12:25] the price it was done
[12:27] but
[12:31] if it's not revealed
[12:33] to us
[12:34] we're still under law
[12:36] and when we get to it i'm just hitting
[12:38] these a little at the time
[12:40] to get you to thinking see
[12:42] you know we don't think
[12:45] about organized religion the way we
[12:47] should and i'm not against anybody i
[12:50] don't have any problems
[12:51] but just we will get to it more and more
[12:54] but
[12:55] see we we thought
[12:57] and man was doing the best he could
[12:59] in the day that he was doing it
[13:02] yet we come out of it with so little of
[13:04] a understanding until
[13:07] the prophet said well maybe we got it in
[13:09] here today he said they disassociated us
[13:13] from the word of god
[13:17] and you said no they was trying
[13:20] he knew that was talking to people right
[13:22] there that was trying
[13:24] but yet he was telling the truth
[13:27] see when we sang that little song god in
[13:30] three persons blessed trinity
[13:34] we don't realize all of our life
[13:37] that's been sung
[13:41] and you know how doctrines start most of
[13:43] the times they start with pictures
[13:46] because a picture captivates your mind
[13:48] it burns an imprint into your brain
[13:52] and in there they put the there's what
[13:54] is it called the madonna
[13:56] you know
[13:57] and they first started out by putting a
[13:59] little light over
[14:00] jesus then the next thing you know
[14:02] there's a little more that light begin
[14:04] to flicker over
[14:05] in pictures until they come over mary
[14:08] and we don't think that means anything
[14:12] but that's burnt into your brain
[14:17] he said but they didn't mean to do it
[14:19] now that was the devil doing that
[14:23] and we'll get down to more of that but
[14:24] what i want you to see is
[14:26] is one point that i've tried to make in
[14:28] the two services
[14:32] see we we jump up into marriage and
[14:34] divorce everybody wants to know about
[14:35] marriage and divorce they want to get
[14:36] set free
[14:39] you know
[14:40] they want to know what this is and what
[14:42] that is and what about marriage and
[14:43] divorce
[14:45] but if you're not born again what good
[14:46] is it that's right
[14:50] when brother branham said this is for
[14:52] the tabernacle only was he meaning that
[14:54] was just for the tabernacle sitting
[14:55] there in jeffersonville
[14:58] or was it as he said those who follow
[15:00] this message
[15:01] all right
[15:03] now
[15:04] you can only be a follower of the
[15:05] message if you're born again outside of
[15:08] that you're following rules and
[15:09] regulations and that's where the trouble
[15:11] is at
[15:14] see you're trying to perfect yourself
[15:16] doing this or not doing that
[15:19] and that's commendable
[15:21] great
[15:23] make a good neighbor
[15:25] but that don't mean you're saved
[15:28] see that's what we've been taught all
[15:30] over life though
[15:31] be good go to church you're going to
[15:33] heaven
[15:37] and that's what's killing
[15:38] us i want you know what i'm
[15:42] my mind you know where it's going so i
[15:43] gotta back up
[15:45] pull off of that get on back where we're
[15:47] at
[15:48] all right
[15:50] but you see
[15:52] if we don't see the new birth
[15:55] right
[15:56] if we don't have the new birth
[16:00] this message
[16:03] totally this bible
[16:05] and all the message
[16:07] is only rules and regulations or words
[16:10] on a page
[16:12] oh you're not saying that about
[16:13] prophet's message well you don't mind me
[16:15] saying about the bible
[16:17] but you just don't want me saying about
[16:18] the prophet see there's their
[16:20] denomination
[16:22] that's killed you
[16:24] first with that idea you're dead
[16:28] what you see
[16:32] it's rules and regulations that's the
[16:34] law paul wasn't under the letter of ten
[16:37] commandments he's talking about
[16:39] we've been over that a little bit we'll
[16:40] get over it more
[16:43] but to think about it
[16:47] unless we're born again
[16:51] see we can't even call him
[16:54] lord
[16:56] we have no right
[16:58] to speak to him whatsoever other than a
[17:00] repentance
[17:02] if we're lost
[17:05] and see then that way you say something
[17:07] and people think you're talking about
[17:09] somebody no i'm talking about me and you
[17:11] okay
[17:12] anybody out there on the internet system
[17:14] if you're listening
[17:16] what brother dale preaches here is to
[17:18] this church
[17:20] all right
[17:21] i refuse to answer your questions refuse
[17:24] to have anything to do with any internet
[17:26] system other than
[17:28] letting it out to the public
[17:30] if you want to listen that's up to you
[17:34] i see you go off and say brother dale
[17:36] said so and so make sure you say what i
[17:38] say
[17:39] because if not the blood's on you
[17:42] that's your business
[17:43] all right
[17:44] you want to listen and use it and help
[17:46] well amen
[17:49] but my wife used to say he said these
[17:50] preachers they don't understand said if
[17:52] they just listen to one sermon
[17:56] that brother dale preacher said they
[17:57] could get 40 messages off of it
[18:00] because he puts that many points into
[18:02] each one and they just listen and save
[18:04] them a lot of trouble because i give
[18:05] them the quotes
[18:07] you know
[18:09] but see they're not going to do it
[18:10] because that's just the way people are
[18:11] and they're doing
[18:12] you've got to listen to brother dale no
[18:15] no
[18:17] but you've got to listen to jesus christ
[18:20] now wherever he's at
[18:23] that's where you listen
[18:25] and that's where you give honor to that
[18:26] part and all like that because it's not
[18:29] what i say
[18:31] it's what the bible says
[18:34] you can take the prophet's message you
[18:36] can take the bible make it say what you
[18:38] want to
[18:41] but that's not what god said
[18:44] even though you've read it to the letter
[18:47] but it's got to be revealed amen
[18:50] the more and more as you see the hour
[18:52] approaching
[18:53] all right but see we think that the
[18:55] first thing we need is we we need to get
[18:57] this grace imagine divorce
[19:01] no you need to get born again
[19:06] because it's not to you
[19:08] do you understand going to make it any
[19:10] plainer
[19:11] that's right
[19:14] the ones who follow this message is
[19:16] supposed to be born again believers
[19:17] right
[19:20] not just a world following the message
[19:24] see we're not born again we're
[19:26] we're lost all right
[19:28] what does it matter what your body's
[19:30] done right right and the mess up you're
[19:32] in physically
[19:34] if your soul is not saved what does it
[19:36] matter
[19:41] well brother dale i i'm born again i
[19:44] proved it because i come in the message
[19:48] well the devil believes it too
[19:50] he come in the message
[19:53] now you got him in on it
[19:56] see that's where god allows things to
[19:58] happen to people brother around and said
[20:00] where they can be a sore thumb i guess
[20:03] because it's
[20:07] ordained deacon at 23 years of age
[20:11] studying the bible praying and seeking
[20:14] god
[20:15] come in this message and found out i
[20:16] wasn't born again everybody else comes
[20:19] into the message
[20:20] and the way they're doing it they find
[20:21] out they was born again
[20:24] i found out it wasn't
[20:26] well you know by doing that i could do
[20:28] something about it
[20:29] i started seeking god
[20:36] i know i was born again because i come
[20:38] in the mess
[20:38] all right that's that's your life
[20:41] that's you that's not me
[20:45] but i hate to be like that lady was that
[20:48] sealed her doom you know
[20:50] and then when she come up to the time
[20:51] she was dying she went on teaching
[20:53] sunday school doing these things you
[20:54] know when it come up to the time of her
[20:55] dying she's screaming out i'm lost
[20:58] that's right
[20:59] she blamed that preacher for blinding
[21:01] her well there's one thing about it you
[21:03] can't blame me for it
[21:05] you can't blame me for telling you
[21:07] you're okay
[21:09] because i don't have any okays for
[21:11] anybody
[21:12] i've got a bible and a prophet's message
[21:15] if it sets you free you're free
[21:19] but if you can't believe it it ain't for
[21:21] you
[21:24] well i believe part of what it that's
[21:26] remember i covered him actually don't i
[21:27] believe part of what he said
[21:30] well
[21:32] i'm sorry that's saying you believe part
[21:34] of the bible
[21:36] but you understand the point i'm trying
[21:38] to drive
[21:39] see what we need is
[21:41] the new birth
[21:45] what we need is to be born again
[21:48] and then we can comprehend
[21:50] or understand
[21:53] what the prophet is saying
[21:55] because until then you can't
[22:02] no man
[22:04] can call jesus the christ or the lord as
[22:07] the scripture said
[22:10] without it being the holy ghost that's
[22:11] first corinthians 12 3.
[22:15] see you're saying what somebody else
[22:17] says
[22:19] and what good is what somebody else said
[22:21] now you misunderstand that point
[22:24] all right
[22:25] but what good is what somebody else says
[22:27] right amen
[22:30] well i brush bless god the bible is what
[22:32] god said right but if it's not revealed
[22:34] to you and i i believe that right
[22:37] it can be questioned do you want the
[22:39] quotes from the prophet
[22:40] he said as long as it's laying in this
[22:42] book it can be questioned
[22:46] he said but when it comes out of the
[22:47] book in other words into your heart is a
[22:48] revelation it can never be questioned
[22:51] again that's right
[22:53] but you see church
[22:57] we want the grace of marriage and
[22:59] divorce because of bodily issues
[23:05] but if we're not born again
[23:08] what good does that do
[23:10] that's right remember marriage and
[23:11] divorce is not for the world
[23:15] that'll show you just what i saw for two
[23:17] services are taught you know we must be
[23:20] born again don't understand
[23:23] because if it's if it could be
[23:24] understood by everybody why would it
[23:27] prophet say it's not for everybody
[23:31] only for those who follow this message
[23:33] all right
[23:35] and see in doing that then we come down
[23:37] to the basis of looking at it and seeing
[23:39] that
[23:41] there's three stages in the journey
[23:43] you've got the new birth the marriage
[23:44] and divorce situation and then you've
[23:46] got the law and grace
[23:50] we can't you say well i ain't under the
[23:51] law see that's where you're jumping over
[23:53] here trying to understand
[23:57] what you see church
[24:02] in our journey
[24:03] we're going to see
[24:05] i keep putting this in because i want
[24:06] you to think about it
[24:10] each one of these stages of that journey
[24:14] new birth marriage and divorce law and
[24:15] grace
[24:17] it means a death
[24:20] to you and i
[24:23] because as long as we stay alive
[24:27] god cannot do nothing
[24:30] what do you think we've been here 40
[24:31] something years after the prophet went
[24:33] off the scene
[24:39] come on
[24:40] well what we're doing waiting on the
[24:41] rest of the world out there now you sure
[24:43] got a bad mental problem
[24:48] come on
[24:51] because if it was
[24:53] waiting for the world to catch up god
[24:55] could send them all here tomorrow and
[24:56] we'd all be gone
[24:58] right
[25:01] but you see that's what we think
[25:04] if everybody can get to where i am we'd
[25:06] be ready to go
[25:09] you ain't never heard me say that
[25:14] way
[25:15] we see the invisible union shows us
[25:19] the the opportunity
[25:22] and explains to us
[25:24] our journey
[25:27] through life
[25:29] it's a wonderful message
[25:31] and it's showing us how that
[25:33] we must be born again then we can talk
[25:36] about marriage and divorce
[25:38] then we can even just at that time that
[25:40] we begin to understand that
[25:42] we can start comprehending the law and
[25:44] grace
[25:47] and what it means
[25:49] but remember each one is a death to the
[25:51] old husband
[25:58] well now let me put this in this way
[26:02] we say well brother dale how
[26:04] how is it that we could die to ourselves
[26:08] because that's what we're talking about
[26:09] you know we're not talking about blowing
[26:11] somebody's brains out and killing them
[26:16] well why can't we remember or think
[26:18] about
[26:21] that by the natural birth that we were
[26:23] and that's what we want to get to this
[26:25] morning more of
[26:27] you know what we were born dead
[26:31] why is it such a problem of dying
[26:37] well i don't want to die
[26:40] why is such a problem of understanding
[26:42] death
[26:44] when we're born dead
[26:46] but oh no no i've borne the seed in me
[26:50] i've got this seed in me i'd burn that
[26:52] seed in me and that seed
[26:55] all it needed was just to kill that old
[26:56] devil out of the way and i just come
[26:58] forth
[27:02] that's denominationalism
[27:06] that's catholicism to the core
[27:10] and yet we call them good brothers
[27:13] you know
[27:15] right
[27:17] but you see church the reason we've been
[27:18] around here all this time is
[27:20] because you and i hadn't got down to
[27:22] seriously about what's going on
[27:25] amen
[27:26] and hey we're all getting old
[27:29] you know
[27:30] i'm looking at wrinkles and hair missing
[27:33] and all kind of things you know
[27:37] you think we got another 50 years
[27:43] i wouldn't want to be one of these kids
[27:44] and think about living 50 more years
[27:49] not in this world
[27:52] right
[27:56] but you see church
[27:59] jesus said you must be born again
[28:02] that's right
[28:04] and as i tried to bring out back there
[28:08] the greatest religious leader that
[28:10] acclaimed him to be
[28:12] sin of god and that nobody could do the
[28:14] things that he done unless god be with
[28:16] him
[28:17] the teacher it says in the original from
[28:20] of nicodemus
[28:23] and yet he couldn't understand
[28:30] but yet we're so quick to say all you
[28:32] gotta do is believe
[28:34] now you think nicodemus wasn't a
[28:36] believer
[28:43] you see we don't think about that we
[28:45] just think about where we are and what
[28:46] we are and got our little petty ideas
[28:49] about ourselves and it don't matter what
[28:50] anybody else says because that's what
[28:52] the bible says
[28:54] that people come to the place during the
[28:56] old testament scripture that everybody
[28:57] done what they thought was right in
[28:59] their own eyes
[29:02] and i'm looking at it
[29:04] and i hope you're looking back at me
[29:09] see as long as we keep on with what we
[29:11] think in our minds and our doings we're
[29:13] going to keep on dying
[29:20] it says what i said we want to try to
[29:21] make marriage and divorce some great
[29:23] height you know the the
[29:27] if you're not born again you can't even
[29:28] start the journey
[29:31] then once we get this settled about
[29:32] marriage and divorce and our natural
[29:34] acts we still got to deal with law and
[29:36] grace
[29:42] well all i want to know is grace let's
[29:43] just tell me just tell me how great i am
[29:47] i can't tell most of you how great you
[29:48] are because you won't even come around
[29:50] to listen
[29:52] i've always done it i'm put this in i'll
[29:54] put it in again i'll put it in again if
[29:56] i stay around another 10 years
[29:58] every time i get down to the bases that
[30:00] i got something i want the people to see
[30:02] they start laying out
[30:04] missing services
[30:07] well you don't understand my case
[30:11] i understand your case that's the
[30:14] problem
[30:16] but i understand the bible
[30:21] but at least now we do have the internet
[30:23] where you can sit this afternoon and
[30:25] listen and criticize without having to
[30:27] look at me
[30:32] right
[30:34] you know it's kind of hard to look
[30:35] people in the eye when they're looking
[30:36] back at you
[30:39] yeah what are you looking at me like
[30:40] that for
[30:44] but listen church
[30:48] you say but i've got it already i know
[30:50] what it is
[30:52] do you
[30:54] i made a statement there the other week
[30:56] and i remember wondering how many
[30:58] remembered it i done it deliberately
[31:02] i only told my wife about it
[31:05] i made a statement
[31:10] and i left no loopholes
[31:14] for anybody with a marital situation
[31:24] then of course you get all upset at me
[31:25] because i bring it up
[31:30] but you get upset at me because of a
[31:32] marital situation you've done now that's
[31:35] first off that's carnal
[31:36] that's right that's no problem that's
[31:38] just carnal
[31:40] you blaming me for what you don't know
[31:41] i'm blaming you for bringing it up
[31:45] but one brother when he left that was
[31:47] what he said
[31:48] he said you just keep bringing things up
[31:52] well all i was doing then was announcing
[31:53] fellowship meetings
[31:55] you know every other week to you know
[31:57] what i was doing
[32:00] but it's all right
[32:05] but i made a statement in there that
[32:06] this afternoon i'm going to get down and
[32:08] really
[32:10] talk about it
[32:14] but when you take what brother branham
[32:15] says without a revelation
[32:18] on marriage in divorce
[32:25] then he comes in the indian comes to the
[32:27] invisible union
[32:30] and he said she can be forgiven
[32:35] it can't be justified
[32:41] remember that statement right
[32:43] now what are you going to do with that
[32:54] and remember
[32:57] she
[32:58] is the bride
[33:02] well according to that the bride can
[33:04] only be forgiven
[33:13] how many of you caught what i said
[33:17] or was even listening
[33:22] you realize how horrible that i could
[33:24] make this thing
[33:27] until none of us have a hoax whatsoever
[33:34] what good thing do you think made you
[33:37] with a hope
[33:43] right
[33:47] what good thing did we do
[33:50] that would make god love us
[34:01] sometimes i wonder even if brother
[34:03] branham understood what he was saying
[34:05] until later when it would unfold and
[34:07] he'd look back and it's oh god
[34:14] look what happened there
[34:20] i believe it unfolded to him don't you
[34:22] sure
[34:25] but we'll get back to that the lord
[34:26] willing this afternoon if we can get
[34:28] this out of the way
[34:31] but see jesus said you must be born
[34:33] again why
[34:35] why is it you must be born again
[34:39] evidently we was born wrong to start
[34:42] with right
[34:43] i mean that's sensible right from that
[34:44] terminologies and
[34:46] doings if jesus was to tell nicodemus
[34:49] you must be born again that meant
[34:50] nicodemus was born wrong
[34:52] now it didn't mean he was physically
[34:54] born wrong
[34:56] because his lineage was perfect or he
[34:58] wouldn't be the guy sitting where he was
[35:01] not only was it the high priest that
[35:03] could be killed
[35:06] but you see those guys sitting in the
[35:08] rims of where nicodemus was at
[35:12] they didn't have no marks
[35:16] paul come up our saying a pharisee of
[35:18] the pharisees
[35:19] a hebrew of the hebrews
[35:21] considering the law of blindness he said
[35:25] but he said i found myself lost
[35:30] what a thing that a man like that would
[35:32] say
[35:33] and yet we think that all it takes is
[35:35] let's just believe in brother dale all
[35:36] it does you just tell us how good we are
[35:40] i'm going to brother so-and-so he tells
[35:41] me well go to brother and so go on
[35:49] but you see
[35:52] the word is supposed to set us
[35:56] all free we don't believe the word then
[35:59] where we're going
[36:01] but now listen let's just read in this
[36:03] let the prophet i'm going to try to read
[36:05] pretty fast and then get back in
[36:07] and and pick up a thought may say a few
[36:08] things along the way
[36:10] but
[36:11] let's just think about what he had to
[36:13] say about you and i
[36:17] go ahead number one brother
[36:20] these will all be from the invisible
[36:22] union i think maybe one that lies but
[36:26] this is paragraph 206 and 207.
[36:31] life is a sacred thing to god it's
[36:32] recorded in a book
[36:34] god is the author of life do you believe
[36:35] that
[36:37] our natural life here we have is just a
[36:39] perversion
[36:41] now what good
[36:42] see that's
[36:43] that's why i can't stay off of those
[36:45] messages that way further
[36:47] because if you believe that you came
[36:49] here with eternal life
[36:51] as it's taught in the message by a lot
[36:54] of preachers then you don't need calvary
[36:59] well brother i've never heard no
[37:01] brothers today
[37:03] you're not listening are you listening
[37:05] now
[37:06] i hope to heaven you're listening better
[37:08] now than you was out there
[37:14] you didn't hear them preachers talk
[37:15] about i always was eternal
[37:18] i got this gene in me
[37:25] well see then jesus didn't need to die
[37:26] for us
[37:29] we should have understood that in the
[37:30] baptist church
[37:32] or wherever you come from before you
[37:34] come in this message i did
[37:37] i knew i must be saved
[37:41] i knew i was lost
[37:48] what about you
[37:51] he said our natural life is just a
[37:52] perversion
[37:53] it really should be the right life to
[37:56] begin with but it's perverted by what
[37:59] the natural birth the first life of your
[38:01] first union you were joined in at birth
[38:04] by nature a natural act
[38:06] a natural human being associated man and
[38:09] woman together associated together in
[38:11] sexual affair which brought you first
[38:14] your first life here and that's
[38:16] associated with sin and death
[38:18] how can you miss seeing the serpent seed
[38:22] now that's that's a good thought
[38:24] but remember where he's preaching in
[38:25] that like i said he's running out of
[38:26] time he's having to start preaching
[38:30] maybe he doesn't know that he's going to
[38:32] die on the road coming back but
[38:34] god is
[38:36] telling him
[38:37] pack it in
[38:39] he was doing every chance he could get
[38:41] look at the next one
[38:43] this is paragraph 2 12-13
[38:46] now what is it what is our natural doing
[38:50] it was nature associated with death
[38:53] so there's nothing alive in the world
[38:56] everything's dead
[38:58] well i see people walking brother
[38:59] they'll they're not dead
[39:02] they're dead in sin and trespasses
[39:07] be better to be physically dead
[39:10] but what was it
[39:11] your first
[39:12] husband
[39:14] well i ain't never been married before
[39:16] he got by one husband
[39:23] that's why paul said he got to be dead
[39:27] to be married to christ
[39:33] well was it your first husband that had
[39:34] rule over you was your nature by natural
[39:37] birth
[39:40] natural you love the world because you
[39:42] are the world
[39:44] and part of the world is that needed
[39:46] explaining
[39:48] that right
[39:49] your desires was by nature to love the
[39:51] world which you are a part of
[39:54] you're a part of nature you believe that
[39:56] and that's your natural thing that's the
[39:58] reason you have to be born again
[40:01] you have to separate
[40:03] you have to die
[40:05] to
[40:07] that first
[40:08] husband go and wrote it on that below
[40:13] you can't live with it
[40:15] you can't say well i'll divorce him
[40:18] and hang him up here till occasion
[40:22] you know what that means in the natural
[40:23] you know you divorce somebody but then
[40:24] you go back and run around with them
[40:26] every once in a while you associate with
[40:28] them you know you do that
[40:30] yeah
[40:31] well you don't think word associate
[40:33] according to how far you go
[40:36] right
[40:41] according how far you go
[40:43] you can't
[40:44] live with it you just say well i'll
[40:46] divorce him hang him up here until
[40:47] occasion no sir no writing or
[40:49] divorcement he dies
[40:52] the nature of the world has to die every
[40:55] speculation has to die you have to be
[40:57] reunited again with another nature
[41:01] all right so you got to be born again
[41:06] right
[41:09] going to number three
[41:12] paragraph 221
[41:14] 222 is really the paragraph you read
[41:16] everything before and after and see if
[41:17] it doesn't match
[41:19] well you're separated from your first
[41:21] union
[41:22] by spiritual death
[41:25] now that's what we should have happened
[41:28] the new birth should have mean that her
[41:30] old husband is dead our adamic nature is
[41:33] that is that enough to understand we
[41:36] were born we'll get to it to see that
[41:38] ken folks to the devil in the book of
[41:40] ruth right
[41:42] then we had one closer kin if we want to
[41:44] type
[41:46] you and i were born in sin secondly
[41:48] iniquity spouse my mother's woman went
[41:50] forth a liar
[41:52] the prophet said on the hebrew series
[41:53] i'd hate to thank that a baby and born
[41:56] five minutes ago and i had to depend on
[41:58] something to go to heaven
[42:03] right
[42:05] you were separated from your first union
[42:06] by spiritual death so if we're not dead
[42:09] he's still alive
[42:13] now you know what he's meaning back over
[42:15] there where you don't divorce him you
[42:17] know to the in the spiritual i mean in
[42:19] the extent of our birth but see we well
[42:22] i'm born again it's okay for me to drink
[42:24] it's okay to
[42:27] my brother colleen was talking about
[42:28] that coffee or something they put that
[42:29] additives into it
[42:33] you know
[42:35] well it's okay
[42:39] we just take a little wine for the
[42:41] stomach's sake
[42:43] are you a woman
[42:47] if you're not you're gonna forget that
[42:48] it don't say for me to take a little
[42:50] whine for the stomach to say
[42:54] right
[42:58] now you're born again are remarried
[43:01] again look at the wordings brother brown
[43:04] and we use
[43:07] explaining the new birth and what are we
[43:09] we're dead to ourselves
[43:11] and remarried to the new spiritual union
[43:14] of not your natural life for the things
[43:16] of the world
[43:17] but of eternal life that germ that was
[43:19] in you at the beginning found you
[43:22] right
[43:23] god's predestination
[43:26] caught up with you right
[43:29] but what about this
[43:31] spiritual death
[43:35] now
[43:38] what is it to die spiritually
[43:44] it means that
[43:47] that you're too totally disassociated or
[43:50] life is disassociated from if you die
[43:52] right
[43:53] if you die you know you don't know
[43:55] what's going on here the bible even said
[43:57] the dead know nothing
[44:00] now
[44:02] but to be spiritual spiritual death
[44:06] means that we need to die to ourselves
[44:10] before we're born again
[44:13] you know that's the reason most people
[44:15] are not born again
[44:18] because they've been taught this taught
[44:20] that taught there's some rule of
[44:22] regulation and if you don't want to go
[44:24] over here you go over there you don't go
[44:26] here you go there you want to go here
[44:27] you go there
[44:29] you're going to find your church
[44:30] somewhere
[44:31] that'll accept your thoughts
[44:34] or you can accept their thoughts
[44:37] right
[44:37] now even in the message you can find it
[44:42] you know where it used to be pure and
[44:44] holy when we
[44:45] back there in the late 60s
[44:48] people was concerned about their lives
[44:49] and concerned about getting people saved
[44:54] then doctrine started coming out of
[44:55] finding out was already saved
[45:06] but you see if you think you're already
[45:07] saved you're dead
[45:09] that's as dead as any dead could be
[45:12] there's no hopes for anyone
[45:16] in that situation
[45:19] are you throwing off no i'm not i'm
[45:21] telling the truth what are you
[45:24] i'm talking to you
[45:27] if you think that then you're dead
[45:30] any blooder
[45:31] you're lost
[45:33] that's why i don't preach on hiring
[45:34] dressing clothes like all the other
[45:36] preachers because they think that's
[45:37] going to drive the women or this and
[45:40] mainly they want to drive the women you
[45:41] know they don't say much about the men
[45:48] the worst rules and regulations ever
[45:50] saved anybody
[45:54] if it is you didn't need jesus christ
[45:57] you mean a man like paul there's nothing
[45:59] they could put a mark on him
[46:02] yet he said i found what i thought was
[46:04] life to be death
[46:08] you know he had to doubt himself
[46:12] what about a man that spent all of his
[46:14] life and they don't nobody knows how old
[46:15] he was but
[46:16] see if he's 30 years old what are we
[46:18] curing
[46:20] i'd figure he's probably older than that
[46:21] because of his rank but
[46:23] what does it matter if he's 30 years old
[46:27] in 30 years he studied the law and found
[46:29] out the law was what was killing him
[46:33] he was studying the word of god and
[46:35] found out the word of god was telling
[46:36] him he's dead
[46:38] amen
[46:42] spiritual death
[46:46] means to die to our ideas
[46:51] our thoughts
[46:52] right
[46:56] but you listen church do you understand
[47:01] what the prophet is talking about
[47:05] our natural life was associated in death
[47:13] spiritual dead
[47:16] that's what i said we don't have to
[47:17] worry about dying
[47:19] we're already dead we just need to
[47:20] realize we're dead and then try to get
[47:22] the deader together the deader we can
[47:24] get
[47:28] until christ can come forth
[47:32] remember
[47:34] you can say i accept jesus
[47:36] christ and see that's what we do and we
[47:39] must
[47:40] but if he don't accept us
[47:42] we don't have anything right
[47:45] is that true now
[47:46] if he don't accept it well why don't he
[47:48] accept us
[47:53] there must be something wrong the reason
[47:55] he doesn't accept us exactly right
[47:58] right
[47:59] well it's certainly not wrong in him
[48:01] that's right
[48:07] but see it's what we've been taught is
[48:08] what's killing us
[48:14] you somebody teach these kids here you
[48:15] don't need to be saved
[48:17] well then somebody come along and try to
[48:19] talk to him about getting i don't need
[48:21] to be saved my daddy told me i didn't
[48:22] need to be sad my mama told me the
[48:25] pastor at the church told me i don't
[48:26] need to be saved
[48:28] will you think they're ever going to get
[48:30] saved
[48:38] come on
[48:42] spiritual death
[48:45] means that we must die to ourselves
[48:49] and be remarried
[48:51] we just read
[48:53] to the new spiritual union
[48:55] of not your natural life of the things
[48:58] of the world
[48:59] but of eternal life
[49:06] we need the new birth
[49:10] you know let's see that's where we get
[49:12] old baptist
[49:13] you ever talk to a baptist about the
[49:15] trinity
[49:16] if i deny the father ought to know the
[49:18] son so i've got to believe there's three
[49:22] because if i deny one i'll deny the
[49:24] other one
[49:24] i'm trying to get you tonight i'm trying
[49:26] to get you to see the truth about it
[49:31] but you see you
[49:37] now
[49:39] how is it
[49:41] because this is my thought so we'll stay
[49:42] here if i don't finish it i don't worry
[49:44] about it
[49:46] i'll get on it this evening some more
[49:51] spiritual death
[49:55] how is it possible to have a spiritual
[49:58] death
[50:03] how you know what would be the
[50:05] possibility
[50:07] of even beginning that thoughts or or
[50:10] ideas of
[50:13] of receiving eternal life
[50:17] i just believe and i got it
[50:20] well okay if you got it
[50:30] but what is the possibility of being
[50:31] spiritually dead
[50:39] it would have to mean that we must die
[50:41] to our own selves
[50:43] our own thinking
[50:47] our own ways and doings
[50:50] let's see that's what everybody wants to
[50:51] do i want you to quit this quit that and
[50:53] do this and do that
[50:55] now brother branham said let's see if
[50:57] i'm paraphrasing it so if you'll miss it
[50:59] a little
[51:02] he said when they said what must we do
[51:03] to be born again he said we tell them
[51:05] what to quit
[51:07] and what to do
[51:12] he said that was not the question that
[51:15] was asked
[51:21] well you don't want us to do what
[51:26] no i want us to die
[51:28] then we don't have to worry about
[51:29] quitting
[51:30] or doing
[51:34] but he said
[51:35] the question was asked what must we do
[51:37] to be born again we tell them to quit
[51:40] do stop this that or the other we give
[51:42] them a book of
[51:44] rules and regulations
[51:46] what's the difference in that and coming
[51:47] up chris kissing the cross
[51:51] oh no you don't like it that bad do you
[51:55] what's the difference coming up bound
[51:56] down and kissing somebody's toe
[52:06] brother dale don't you think i need to
[52:08] quit this
[52:11] no
[52:14] we had a piano player
[52:16] she's passed on to glory
[52:20] she played our piano for 16 i think 16
[52:22] years
[52:23] but you know probably about five or six
[52:25] of those years
[52:29] she was still smoking
[52:39] you let her play piano and her smoking
[52:43] yeah i'll let you in the door
[52:46] you want to argue
[52:49] any problems
[52:55] but you see you ain't getting on my
[52:58] platform
[53:00] any kind of things like that
[53:07] that's all right
[53:10] honorable and commendable
[53:15] if you're walking the straight line
[53:23] right
[53:25] you walk in a straight line you can talk
[53:26] about somebody else walking crooked
[53:28] right
[53:30] but if you walk in crooked
[53:33] and that's what a lot of us doing that's
[53:35] why they rant and rave about what's on
[53:36] the platform
[53:44] you see
[53:47] spiritual death
[53:53] is there any hopes for any of us
[53:56] is there any opportunity for anybody in
[53:58] the world
[54:07] he said with the prophet of god he
[54:08] really had a good life amen but he was
[54:10] born in sin shaping an iniquity spouse
[54:12] from the mother's womb went forth a liar
[54:15] he said
[54:17] lost and doomed and on his way to hell
[54:19] he said
[54:22] and it had to be born again he said
[54:24] that's right
[54:36] but see we're always trying to bypass
[54:41] the right way of doing something
[54:47] my wife will tell you in a hurry that
[54:49] when i do anything i generally do it the
[54:50] hard way
[54:54] but you know what i get it done
[54:58] and when i get it done
[55:00] what's the difference in how i got there
[55:06] as long as i get it done
[55:13] but see church that's just the way i
[55:15] have to deal in salvation
[55:17] it may be the hardest way the way that i
[55:19] preach and think
[55:20] you wouldn't understand me sitting this
[55:22] morning
[55:23] thinking lord i'm going to go today and
[55:24] i'm going to be the sweetest preachers
[55:26] ever been
[55:28] and i'm going to just tell them about
[55:29] the grace of jesus christ
[55:40] but you see that ain't going to save us
[55:43] you've heard that all your life
[55:45] maybe perverted way of bringing it by
[55:47] organizations and things but you've
[55:48] heard grace preached all of your life
[55:50] right
[55:52] come on did you
[55:56] everybody had a form of grace every
[55:58] church has a form of grace
[56:02] what did it do for you
[56:08] did it set you free
[56:13] or did the revelation of jesus christ
[56:15] set you free
[56:17] now which one
[56:19] which one is it
[56:21] is it just grace that we see in this
[56:23] grace and grace and grace
[56:26] or is it a revelation of jesus christ
[56:35] see then if it's revelation of jesus
[56:37] christ what we need is a revelation and
[56:39] have a revelation we must have a new
[56:40] birth
[56:49] you see church that's what everybody
[56:51] wants
[56:53] they want somebody they want to see
[56:55] these kind of forms or whatever forgive
[56:57] me but they want to say well wade's got
[56:59] a problem let's go cast it off of him
[57:01] let's do it
[57:04] i'm not against that now you go and do
[57:06] what you want to with what i say
[57:08] i illustrate
[57:10] that's right though that don't shake
[57:12] that demon out of him
[57:16] number one
[57:18] you got to realize he's got one right
[57:20] right
[57:22] if you don't realize he's got one it
[57:23] ain't gonna do you no good to shake him
[57:24] all over the place
[57:27] and ain't nobody here believes in
[57:29] emotions anymore in this man you're
[57:30] looking at
[57:33] but you show me in the bible where that
[57:35] was
[57:40] that's all i want
[57:43] show me in the bible
[57:46] where jesus done anything other than
[57:48] speak the word
[57:50] or preach the word to him
[57:57] come on i'm open folks
[58:00] but i won't see it
[58:04] i want to see where brother branham done
[58:05] anything other than preaching the gospel
[58:10] yes he was very emotional
[58:13] i believe in emotions i believe in life
[58:16] anywhere there's life there's going to
[58:17] be emotions
[58:18] amen
[58:22] but not screaming and hollering at
[58:23] devils is not going to drive them out
[58:28] you want a devil driven out of you sit
[58:30] down and listen to the word of god
[58:38] right
[58:43] i don't think brother donnie minds me
[58:44] telling it
[58:46] he was still smoking a little bit we let
[58:48] him get up here and play the banjo
[58:52] do things
[58:57] you see
[59:01] we've got a little book of rules that we
[59:03] don't want nobody else to know about
[59:06] so we won't tell nobody about it
[59:09] but we sit in our own little selves
[59:16] but where's there any possibility
[59:19] of any human being
[59:24] of ever coming to salvation
[59:32] well brother daley's got to believe on
[59:34] the lord jesus christ
[59:38] that's scripture
[59:41] but you know we leave out those things
[59:43] that he that believeth and is baptized
[59:46] we leave out being born again
[59:50] we live out a lot of scriptures on the
[59:52] things
[59:53] right
[59:54] and we just try to
[59:56] make our own little padded pitted ways
[59:58] you know
[1:00:05] but where's the possibility for anybody
[1:00:07] ever being saved
[1:00:17] well
[1:00:20] according to the prophet
[1:00:22] and the bible
[1:00:29] then
[1:00:30] a revelation
[1:00:33] is the only thing that can set us free
[1:00:35] right
[1:00:38] not a head knowledge or a thought
[1:00:40] but but revelation amen
[1:00:43] he that the son is set free what it's
[1:00:45] free indeed
[1:00:50] so then if we were lost and undone and
[1:00:53] we were and doomed and
[1:00:55] everything else then
[1:00:57] no matter what we could do or not do
[1:01:00] would have nothing to do with it
[1:01:03] it wouldn't change it
[1:01:08] so our total dependence is upon what he
[1:01:10] done
[1:01:13] you agree
[1:01:16] our total dependence of anything
[1:01:18] salvation marriage and divorce law and
[1:01:20] grace rapture
[1:01:22] anything is based on one thing
[1:01:27] whether or not he's real
[1:01:30] that's it right
[1:01:32] and whether or not he kept his word
[1:01:37] are you talking about laws never why
[1:01:39] blood you don't even understand about
[1:01:40] grace because i'm waiting for it amen
[1:01:45] but you don't understand the law
[1:01:48] the law was spiritual
[1:01:50] right
[1:01:55] is that what paul said
[1:02:03] but see how could
[1:02:05] we ever think about being
[1:02:11] dead enough
[1:02:14] that's why that message we put in there
[1:02:16] on the
[1:02:17] the soul is very valuable
[1:02:19] i've read around and said if he can just
[1:02:20] get that soul that nature or spirit
[1:02:25] to agree with him
[1:02:28] he said it'll die
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:31] the goodness of god calleth thee to
[1:02:33] repentance it's not whether or not we
[1:02:34] get down and pray and cry and scream and
[1:02:36] seek after god right
[1:02:39] is whether god's seeking after us
[1:02:46] because it's the goodness of god that
[1:02:47] leads you to repentance not not how much
[1:02:49] you fast and pray and whatever you do
[1:02:55] but you you sound like salvation is just
[1:02:58] not for everybody
[1:02:59] it's for everybody that will believe it
[1:03:05] you say brother dale if any halts on me
[1:03:07] in my marital situation
[1:03:09] if you don't believe it there is none
[1:03:16] so you can't blame god
[1:03:23] because if you don't believe you can't
[1:03:25] be saved
[1:03:27] don't blame god
[1:03:33] see then the whole key is whether or not
[1:03:39] god is real
[1:03:46] whether or not he keep his word
[1:03:48] we know if he's real and he's god he's
[1:03:50] bound to have to keep his word
[1:03:55] right
[1:04:00] see and he said you must be born again
[1:04:08] then that's not a thought or an idea or
[1:04:11] concept
[1:04:14] that's the truth
[1:04:18] and to do that we've got to die
[1:04:27] our old husband has got to be dead
[1:04:35] like brother hanson said that time's a
[1:04:37] good point i hope you don't mind me
[1:04:38] quoting him he said it enough
[1:04:41] he said it's not all the wives that i'd
[1:04:42] have to be my problems how many husbands
[1:04:44] i've had
[1:04:54] you see church our first husband we just
[1:04:56] read
[1:04:57] that had rule over us was our natural
[1:04:59] nature
[1:05:01] that was our husband
[1:05:05] and to be reunited with jesus christ we
[1:05:09] must take another nature right amen
[1:05:16] and to take that nature is not putting
[1:05:19] that nature in you in your nature that's
[1:05:22] right
[1:05:25] it's going to be death to ourselves amen
[1:05:35] you see a lot of people are not honest
[1:05:37] in not knowing rules and regulations or
[1:05:39] whatever
[1:05:41] of churches and what they do they don't
[1:05:43] pay no attention
[1:05:45] i've told you many times about it when i
[1:05:46] was in the baptist church
[1:05:48] and a deacon well up looked up to 23
[1:05:51] years of age so you know that was
[1:05:55] but you know the day i got baptized in
[1:05:57] the name of the lord jesus christ they
[1:05:58] didn't run me out of the church
[1:06:04] i knew i was contrary to the doctrine
[1:06:09] because anybody in the baptist church is
[1:06:11] baptized any other way than the father
[1:06:13] son holy ghost
[1:06:14] and you go join another church somewhere
[1:06:16] else don't make no difference once you
[1:06:18] go join and what you do you go join
[1:06:20] another church that baptized father son
[1:06:22] and holy ghost you go from a baptist to
[1:06:24] a methodist and you join that church and
[1:06:27] you get baptized again
[1:06:28] you come back to that baptist church
[1:06:30] you're going to get baptized again
[1:06:32] or you're not going to be a member of
[1:06:34] the baptist church
[1:06:41] see that's how much they believe in you
[1:06:44] well see i knew the day that i was
[1:06:46] baptized i knew that was the end of my
[1:06:48] time in the baptist church
[1:06:50] and it wasn't going to be that they were
[1:06:52] going to run me out
[1:06:56] i think a lot of times about like moses
[1:06:58] and i know you say well not compare
[1:07:00] yourself i'm not i'm just talking
[1:07:04] moses could have caused an insurrection
[1:07:06] down in egypt and took over
[1:07:09] he was the head of the army
[1:07:12] he could have called a coup and probably
[1:07:13] done a good job
[1:07:16] but that wasn't the way god wanted it
[1:07:20] see my family was
[1:07:23] over well over a third of that church
[1:07:26] my brother-in-law's family that was
[1:07:27] married into the family his family was
[1:07:29] over
[1:07:29] probably
[1:07:30] almost 50 percent of that church
[1:07:33] see i could have pulled some ranks and
[1:07:39] but i knew that wouldn't work
[1:07:44] so i walked out the door
[1:07:49] it wasn't the point of whether or not i
[1:07:51] was anything i knew i was contrary to
[1:07:53] the doctrine
[1:07:56] and to be contrary to the doctrine then
[1:07:58] i could not be there and stay there
[1:08:06] see every church teaches basically what
[1:08:08] i'm fixing to say that jesus christ come
[1:08:11] and died for our sins right
[1:08:17] but the problem is is when they teach
[1:08:19] you that jesus christ came and they
[1:08:21] don't teach you that that was almighty
[1:08:22] god
[1:08:27] so almighty god had to come down
[1:08:30] because that's what your prophet has to
[1:08:31] say what the bible says that god came
[1:08:35] but around says god saw us in that shape
[1:08:38] and said he knew something had to be
[1:08:40] done he said he came himself he didn't
[1:08:44] send a son
[1:08:45] another person or whatever said he came
[1:08:47] himself
[1:08:53] that's why the scripture said he that
[1:08:54] cometh to god must believe that he is
[1:08:56] and the rewarder of them that diligently
[1:08:57] seek him
[1:09:01] you're not believing he was or he's a
[1:09:02] thought or he's an idea or a concept or
[1:09:05] another person or whatever
[1:09:07] you got to believe that he is
[1:09:13] you never be saved without believing on
[1:09:15] the lord jesus christ
[1:09:18] he said well all him people wouldn't say
[1:09:20] brother
[1:09:24] if god accepted you back there under
[1:09:26] denominationalisms and trinities and
[1:09:28] things and gave you the new birth i'm
[1:09:30] not going to argue with you
[1:09:34] because that's between you and god
[1:09:37] right right
[1:09:41] but i'm just going to tell you it don't
[1:09:43] happen that way in every
[1:09:46] case all right
[1:09:50] see then i'd rather go through life how
[1:09:51] many statements are made of this i'd
[1:09:53] rather go through life seeking god
[1:09:57] find out one day i had him did he get
[1:09:58] there and find out i didn't have him
[1:10:00] because somebody told me something
[1:10:10] but you see it's up to god to make a way
[1:10:16] it's up to god to make a way
[1:10:19] that you and i
[1:10:22] could be saved
[1:10:25] but the one thing he can't do
[1:10:31] are you listening
[1:10:33] god cannot override your free moral
[1:10:35] agency
[1:10:40] he cannot make you be saved if you don't
[1:10:43] want to be
[1:10:48] he can't make you
[1:10:51] come to him and believe if you don't
[1:10:53] want to
[1:10:58] so we have something to do with
[1:10:59] believing don't we
[1:11:05] see that only lies for a certain part
[1:11:07] because that's the point
[1:11:09] let's make it a moment ago
[1:11:11] the prophet said it like this he said
[1:11:13] you've accepted jesus christ who said
[1:11:15] but has he accepted you
[1:11:21] you know over in the book of acts
[1:11:23] they were praying for him to receive the
[1:11:24] holy ghost
[1:11:27] right right in the book of acts
[1:11:30] who was it
[1:11:32] john and somebody which one or the other
[1:11:34] peter and john
[1:11:36] two in other words they were praying the
[1:11:37] people were praying for them to get the
[1:11:38] holy ghost couldn't get it on they
[1:11:40] called up and got elders
[1:11:42] they got us either john or peter or one
[1:11:44] of the two someone to come down
[1:11:46] and they came down and laid hands on
[1:11:48] them they received the holy ghost what
[1:11:49] was wrong
[1:11:52] good believers
[1:11:57] was there any difference in the two
[1:11:59] people
[1:12:01] was there any difference in the holy
[1:12:02] ghost in this man and the holy ghost in
[1:12:04] that man
[1:12:09] come on what was the difference why
[1:12:11] didn't the holy ghost come on them
[1:12:15] well it was in the secret way of those
[1:12:17] hands they had to have the special hands
[1:12:26] i believe whenever who got there said a
[1:12:28] few words and they did the holy ghost
[1:12:29] failed
[1:12:34] whether you believe that or not that's
[1:12:35] your business i don't care
[1:12:37] i'm just saying they've done something
[1:12:40] that it was not just some secret thing
[1:12:42] don't say it was cause it was in the
[1:12:43] body with this man that was down here
[1:12:44] trying to get them to get the holy ghost
[1:12:46] was in the body
[1:12:52] i know what your prophet says
[1:12:55] he said the seed was in the body
[1:12:58] i agree
[1:13:00] but the seed was in that other man is
[1:13:02] trying to get the holy ghost come on
[1:13:03] we're not talking about in the book of
[1:13:04] acts we're apollos and trying to i'm not
[1:13:06] talking about that get over in the bible
[1:13:08] and read it
[1:13:09] i'm talking about where they were trying
[1:13:11] to pray for them to get the holy ghost
[1:13:12] and couldn't get it
[1:13:18] for two years i sought god
[1:13:21] but a man one day made a statement
[1:13:28] he said brother dale i don't know what
[1:13:29] you're
[1:13:30] doing what you want him i said i don't
[1:13:33] either because ain't nothing i want
[1:13:35] except god
[1:13:39] he said i don't believe you're seeking
[1:13:41] some sign or some thing to happen i said
[1:13:43] no sir
[1:13:44] i just want to know
[1:13:48] he said will you remember one thing
[1:13:53] he said everybody thinks the holy ghost
[1:13:55] is this or holy ghost is that anointings
[1:13:57] and all that he said all of that you
[1:13:58] know about i said yes sir
[1:14:02] but he said you remember one thing
[1:14:07] god
[1:14:08] is a person
[1:14:10] amen
[1:14:13] he said in the new birth
[1:14:15] it's a birth of that person
[1:14:18] in you
[1:14:22] that was all it took
[1:14:26] that solved my problems
[1:14:29] because of what somebody said
[1:14:31] right
[1:14:33] see faith cometh by hearing
[1:14:35] hearing by the word
[1:14:42] brother dale we're not all you i agree
[1:14:44] with you i'm glad of that
[1:14:46] be a horrible world that everybody was
[1:14:48] to me
[1:14:54] but you see i'm just one person to do
[1:14:55] one thing
[1:15:02] i wanted god
[1:15:04] i wanted an answer and i wanted an
[1:15:06] assurance i wanted something i could
[1:15:07] stand on
[1:15:08] when the world would stand in my face
[1:15:13] i told you about the baptist preacher of
[1:15:15] me talking to him about water baptism
[1:15:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:15:19] he said and i had told him that i wasn't
[1:15:21] born again
[1:15:23] he said
[1:15:25] who do you think you are trying to teach
[1:15:27] me
[1:15:28] he said i claim to be born again
[1:15:30] and said you admit you're not born again
[1:15:33] and said you're trying to teach me
[1:15:38] you're right
[1:15:42] but a few weeks later i run into the man
[1:15:44] there at work and i said
[1:15:46] your statements are no longer worth
[1:15:48] anything
[1:15:50] because now i have the experience right
[1:15:54] i didn't have no different words
[1:15:56] i had an experience
[1:15:59] luther taught the just shall live by
[1:16:00] faith claim salvation
[1:16:03] claim to believe in jesus christ
[1:16:04] preached him
[1:16:08] but one day
[1:16:12] the christ of the word came alive in his
[1:16:14] heart
[1:16:15] that's it
[1:16:17] has it done it to you
[1:16:20] and to do that you got to die amen
[1:16:24] yes but brother dale if i admit it i was
[1:16:26] lost
[1:16:28] look where i'd be in good shape
[1:16:34] if i deny the father i deny the son see
[1:16:36] you're trinitarian don't realize it
[1:16:42] you see i'm just straight and plain
[1:16:44] enough to want to know
[1:16:51] like i told the brother all of the
[1:16:52] reading i'd done and all of the tapes i
[1:16:54] listened to and i said i wasn't born
[1:16:56] again he said brother there's something
[1:16:57] wrong with you said you're reading the
[1:16:58] book today it's proved you was born
[1:17:00] again i said didn't prove it to me
[1:17:06] spiritual death
[1:17:10] that means we've got to get rid of
[1:17:12] everything
[1:17:14] and we'll read some more this afternoon
[1:17:15] where brother brown said
[1:17:17] every speck of him
[1:17:20] has got to be dead
[1:17:28] every speck of him
[1:17:31] he's got to be dead
[1:17:35] now i want to know about marriage and
[1:17:37] divorce that's what i want to know about
[1:17:38] i want to get free free from what
[1:17:47] if you're not free in the baptism of the
[1:17:48] holy ghost there is no marriage in
[1:17:50] divorce grace
[1:17:55] the new birth is first amen and foremost
[1:17:58] in our lives
[1:18:03] but the prophet said in the bla in birth
[1:18:05] plains it was hard to get them pharisees
[1:18:07] to realize they was lost
[1:18:09] where they'd seek god for salvation
[1:18:13] you see that's what's wrong with you and
[1:18:15] me
[1:18:18] sit and think that we're saved because
[1:18:19] we're in the message we believe the
[1:18:21] message we do
[1:18:24] what do you want me to do brother dale i
[1:18:25] want you to get bored again i want you
[1:18:27] to have an experience that nobody can
[1:18:29] take away from you
[1:18:38] no matter what anybody says you'll just
[1:18:39] stand there and look right at them and
[1:18:41] say thank you for being the way you are
[1:18:43] but i'm still staying where i stand
[1:18:48] you see i've told you about it i met god
[1:18:50] when i was 10 11 years old
[1:18:53] i seen him standing there but i never
[1:18:54] claimed that as a new birth
[1:18:59] i've seen an angel three times in my
[1:19:01] life i never claimed that to be a new
[1:19:03] birth
[1:19:05] but you can't argue with me about what i
[1:19:07] saw
[1:19:08] i'll take a lie detector's test anytime
[1:19:10] you want to about it
[1:19:15] but you see when i begin to hear that
[1:19:17] prophet talk about the birth of the word
[1:19:22] as that brother moak said
[1:19:23] god is alive he's real
[1:19:27] he's not just a thought
[1:19:29] he's a person
[1:19:34] but lord that's what i want
[1:19:40] see then you can't argue with me about
[1:19:41] that person
[1:19:46] because i've taught it down through here
[1:19:47] for 40 something years you can't argue
[1:19:50] about what i said about that god
[1:19:55] because i took it right out of the word
[1:20:00] to talk to you about him that i saw
[1:20:02] myself
[1:20:05] i can only tell you about my own life
[1:20:08] that's right
[1:20:11] martin luther couldn't talk about john
[1:20:13] wesley but neither did john wesley talk
[1:20:15] about martin luther sure he had him as a
[1:20:17] foundation but he said we got to go on
[1:20:20] now come on musicians
[1:20:24] and just end off cause i
[1:20:30] can't but you see church we want to talk
[1:20:33] about grace
[1:20:38] but if you're not born again you don't
[1:20:39] learn about grace
[1:20:41] you know words
[1:20:43] terminology's thoughts and what people
[1:20:46] say is
[1:20:48] understand
[1:20:50] you just know what somebody else has
[1:20:51] said about it but when you have an
[1:20:53] experience
[1:20:59] like old brother al said one time he
[1:21:01] said once you go up there and try to let
[1:21:02] brother dale try to talk you out of your
[1:21:04] healing or something
[1:21:06] you know
[1:21:07] but if i can talk you out of it ain't
[1:21:09] real
[1:21:12] right
[1:21:16] salvation is a person amen
[1:21:19] our old husband our old nature our old
[1:21:22] ways our old thoughts
[1:21:23] has got to die
[1:21:25] and that's the reason a lot of people
[1:21:27] are not born again
[1:21:29] because they're not going to do that
[1:21:33] they're not going to admit they're lost
[1:21:36] god can't help somebody that won't admit
[1:21:38] they're lost
[1:21:44] i've never been in the woods but one
[1:21:45] time and got lost
[1:21:48] and i wasn't afraid for myself that day
[1:21:50] is the reason i was there
[1:21:54] when you're lost you don't know which
[1:21:56] way you're going
[1:21:58] all your smartness all of your thoughts
[1:22:00] all of your river running this way your
[1:22:02] brain's running that away
[1:22:10] it won't work
[1:22:14] you'll start going around and around
[1:22:17] and the more you go around and around
[1:22:19] the deader you get
[1:22:23] just sat down
[1:22:26] that's what i done just backed up
[1:22:27] against the tree and sat down
[1:22:29] i said i'll just sit here little
[1:22:31] daylight comes
[1:22:35] but then after a while i got to thinking
[1:22:37] i couldn't do that
[1:22:38] somebody else was involved so i had to
[1:22:40] get out
[1:22:45] so i'd done the only sensible thing
[1:22:47] could be done where i was at
[1:22:50] i headed to the highest hill i could
[1:22:51] find
[1:22:55] and i hollered
[1:23:00] richard marlo found
[1:23:01] hollered back
[1:23:05] i made my way to him
[1:23:11] so you think you're not lost
[1:23:15] well my daddy is the pastor of this
[1:23:17] church i don't mean you're saved
[1:23:20] my husband no that don't mean you're
[1:23:21] saved
[1:23:25] it's whether or not you're born again
[1:23:27] go ahead just one one or two verses then
[1:23:30] we're going to eat together so we can
[1:23:32] take a little bit of time 124.

[1:25:58] problems with the little ones lord
[1:26:00] could we just live
[1:26:04] lord
[1:26:06] the same one that paid the price for the
[1:26:08] big ones paid it for the little ones

[1:26:21] satan
[1:26:22] in the name of jesus christ we challenge
[1:26:24] you
[1:26:26] not of us but the god that's within us
[1:26:28] upon you the word of god that says
[1:26:31] she's healed
[1:26:33] you keep telling us we're not but yet
[1:26:36] your word lord says we are and we
[1:26:38] believe you
[1:26:39] in jesus name
[1:26:43] anybody else
[1:26:54] let's see
[1:27:13] in the name of jesus christ we give
[1:27:15] these prayer claws our brother
[1:27:17] the place within his home
[1:27:19] to get rid of all of these allergies and
[1:27:22] things that are bothering sterling darth
[1:27:24] the doctor now lord
[1:27:26] we pray that you just bless him and take
[1:27:28] care of it
[1:27:30] just let your love be made manifest
[1:27:32] in jesus name
[1:27:36] anybody else
[1:27:44] the church we got to be born again
[1:27:47] if we're not born again
[1:27:51] we can't even start any journey
[1:27:53] whatsoever
[1:27:55] so your pride
[1:28:01] i
[1:28:03] take care of it
[1:28:05] i'd get rid of it
[1:28:10] but i'm not gonna admit i'm lost because
[1:28:11] if i did i'd be lost now show me that
[1:28:14] i want that in the scriptures and i want
[1:28:16] it in the prophet's message i know what
[1:28:18] he said about confessions
[1:28:22] i know he says we've got to confess it
[1:28:24] because we don't confess it god can't
[1:28:25] make it
[1:28:29] but where's an honest heart that he ever
[1:28:31] spoke of that was crying out to god
[1:28:33] and god would not hear that heart
[1:28:40] what is it it's because we won't get
[1:28:43] ourselves out of the way that just keeps
[1:28:44] burdening on me
[1:28:47] i'm sorry
[1:28:48] it just burdens on my heart to think
[1:28:50] about people
[1:28:52] that will not think about the fact that
[1:28:54] they could be lost
[1:28:57] they just everybody wants to think how
[1:28:59] saved they are
[1:29:03] and it's got to worthy and the kids
[1:29:04] don't even want to come to alder why
[1:29:06] because
[1:29:07] the parents don't want to come
[1:29:13] what about it
[1:29:26] ready
[1:29:46] cheers
[1:29:56] um
[1:30:09] for jesus you heard our sister lord
[1:30:12] she wants to know that she's saved
[1:30:16] but we could do a lot of things and ask
[1:30:18] a lot of points to do and she'd do
[1:30:19] anything we ask
[1:30:21] to be able to come to that place but
[1:30:23] there's just one thing
[1:30:25] that our sister needs to do and that's
[1:30:26] just yield herself to you lord
[1:30:29] and just believe it
[1:30:30] and just wait on you
[1:30:33] not to try to figure it out but just
[1:30:34] wait and let everything lord
[1:30:37] turn out to be the right
[1:30:39] we love you father
[1:30:41] we thank you
[1:30:42] we know that you're here
[1:30:44] to give us what our desires are
[1:30:47] lord we ask that in jesus name
[1:30:53] anybody else
[1:31:07] never stop seeking god
[1:31:16] you believe that prophet had god in his
[1:31:18] heart but he never stopped seeking god
[1:31:26] he was listening our life not i believe
[1:31:27] it was or not before
[1:31:29] he said
[1:31:30] lord i've done everything i can do to
[1:31:32] try to get them to believe
[1:31:36] what else can i do
[1:31:42] he said he laid before god until that
[1:31:44] gift would work in his life
[1:31:47] he said i've done everything i can do to
[1:31:48] get him to believe
[1:31:52] then he came out the next night and he
[1:31:54] said
[1:31:57] i believe america has turned down the
[1:31:58] gospel
[1:32:02] but that don't mean we have to turn it
[1:32:04] down because we're individuals
[1:32:10] told
[1:32:13] anybody else before we go
[1:32:38] none but amen and amen and amen and amen
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:44] brother dean has a word you know
[1:32:46] sam i'd like to give a short testimony
[1:32:49] something happened to me tuesday
[1:32:52] thursday evening
[1:32:53] i had been talking to this brother for
[1:32:56] an hour and a half two hours about the
[1:32:59] mysteries of god
[1:33:01] brother in the message
[1:33:03] and uh
[1:33:04] i'm always
[1:33:06] very when i get through talking it
[1:33:08] breaks up i'm i'm always so desperate to
[1:33:11] god that i haven't said anything wrong
[1:33:13] you know
[1:33:15] and i i walked outside
[1:33:18] and uh
[1:33:19] and i was talking to almighty god and i
[1:33:21] said lord
[1:33:23] if i've said anything
[1:33:26] we're displeasing to you if i said
[1:33:28] anything wrong i was explaining
[1:33:32] the mysteries
[1:33:33] and i had my eyes closed if you all know
[1:33:36] the weather it was real cloudy
[1:33:39] and
[1:33:40] god is my witness
[1:33:42] i closed had my eyes closed
[1:33:45] and i felt this light
[1:33:49] bryce i've never seen
[1:33:51] my eyes was closed i've never seen
[1:33:54] anything this bright and it come down
[1:33:57] over my head i'm just talking what
[1:33:59] happened
[1:34:00] ain't got nothing i ain't got to do with
[1:34:02] nothing
[1:34:03] you know but
[1:34:04] god was concerned with me because i've
[1:34:06] been
[1:34:07] really studying the characteristics of
[1:34:09] god
[1:34:10] god's got a character and he's got
[1:34:12] characteristics and this is to be made
[1:34:15] of benefits in us exactly
[1:34:17] and it it just kept it just kept it
[1:34:20] enveloping me
[1:34:22] and uh i just it
[1:34:24] really
[1:34:25] kind of frightened me
[1:34:27] but i thought to start with when it
[1:34:28] started i said well the sun's come out
[1:34:30] you know it was late in the evening
[1:34:32] and uh when i opened my eyes
[1:34:36] it was just as cloudy as it ever was
[1:34:39] but i believe god showed me right then
[1:34:41] that what i was teaching
[1:34:43] was correct and he
[1:34:45] he was mindful this is just what if if
[1:34:48] we can grasp
[1:34:50] what has been preached to us and see it
[1:34:53] that it's the truth
[1:34:55] god always comes on the scene is us that
[1:34:57] don't recognize his characteristics
[1:35:00] god can be speaking through a man's lips
[1:35:03] and his deity speaking and like sarah
[1:35:06] said if how could this be
[1:35:08] see she doubted
[1:35:10] how can this be and that very thing is
[1:35:12] here today
[1:35:14] how could this be what the brother is
[1:35:16] saying how could it be
[1:35:18] you know how how could this happen
[1:35:20] see god said he would by the promise of
[1:35:23] god but brother sam that that actually
[1:35:25] happened whatever it means i don't know
[1:35:27] i've just taken it that god told me that
[1:35:30] that what i was what was happening i
[1:35:33] would i don't know what would have
[1:35:34] happened bro saying if i hadn't opened
[1:35:36] my eyes i i'm
[1:35:38] i'm just i've never seen and i've been
[1:35:41] in medals for for many many years but
[1:35:43] i've never seen nothing like this
[1:35:46] and i just i feel compelled
[1:35:49] to say it
[1:35:51] amen

[1:35:55] go
