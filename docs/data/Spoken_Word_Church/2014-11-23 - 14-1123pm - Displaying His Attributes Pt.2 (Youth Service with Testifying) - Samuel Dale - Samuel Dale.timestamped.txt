[28:30] we're gonna um take
[28:32] turns um doing it
[28:36] so I'll go first since we're gets well
[28:40] I'd like to um read from the Book of
[28:46] Jonah stand
[28:49] up now Jonah I believe really I'm
[28:54] reading from this book because it
[28:56] reveals how how God actually showed a
[29:00] man that no matter what he'll still be
[29:04] there with him and he'll take him
[29:06] through the trials that he needs so if
[29:09] it all bow your heads we pray before we
[29:11] read the
[29:13] scriptures Lord God thank you for this
[29:15] day Lord and thank you for everything
[29:17] against us Lord thank you for having the
[29:19] song service Lord and help me Lord and I
[29:22] know I'm not the best at this Lord but
[29:25] help me in doing
[29:28] this service Lord was that and thank you
[29:31] for everything Lord and help all the
[29:33] prayer requests that were prayed Lord
[29:35] and just bless this service in the name
[29:37] of Jesus Christ I pray
[29:40] amen I'd like like to read um Jonah 1
[29:43] the chap first chapter of Jonah verses 1
[29:50] through
[29:54] six now the word of the Lord came unto
[29:58] Jonah the son of amii saying arise go to
[30:02] Nineveh that great City and cry against
[30:04] it for the wickedness is come up before
[30:07] me but Jonah rose up to flee unto
[30:13] tus from the presence of the Lord and he
[30:16] went down to jopa and he found a ship
[30:18] going to tarus so he paid the fair
[30:22] thereof and went down unto it to go with
[30:25] them unto tarus from the presence of the
[30:28] Lord but the Lord sent out a great wind
[30:30] into the sea and there was a mighty
[30:32] Tempest in the sea so that the ship was
[30:35] like to be broken when the Mariners were
[30:37] afraid and cried every man unto his God
[30:41] and cast forth the Wares that were in
[30:44] the ship into the sea to lighten it of
[30:47] them but Jonah was gone down into the
[30:49] sides of the ship and he lay and was
[30:51] fast
[30:55] asleep so the ship master came to him
[30:58] and said unto him what meanest thou
[31:00] sleeper arise call upon thy God if so be
[31:04] that God will think upon us that we
[31:06] shall not
[31:08] perish
[31:11] amen so that we shall not perish not and
[31:15] then and they said everyone unto his
[31:18] fellow come and let us cast lots that we
[31:20] may know for who cause this evil is upon
[31:23] us so they cast lots and the lot fell
[31:25] upon Jonah you may be SE
[31:30] I'd like to speak now
[31:32] um how that God in whenever he showed
[31:39] Jonah cuz he disobeyed God he just
[31:42] simply disobeyed him amen but through
[31:44] all that as we read throughout the four
[31:48] chapters how God showed him that
[31:51] wherever you can't hide from God am so
[31:55] wherever you go God knows where you are
[31:57] and he'll he'll still show you the right
[31:59] way that's right and so if you can turn
[32:03] to chapter
[32:05] 2 it says that then God prayed unto the
[32:10] Lord his God out of the belly the fish's
[32:12] belly because he was um he was thrown
[32:15] into the sea because they cast lots and
[32:18] they all it landed on Jonah and so they
[32:20] cast him into the sea and he was
[32:21] swallowed by the
[32:24] fish swallowed by the fish and
[32:30] so he
[32:34] just he was shown that he has to obey
[32:38] God because he was swallowed by a fish
[32:40] and even after that he still wanted to
[32:42] run until he had to stay in a fish's
[32:44] belly for three nights and trust me that
[32:48] really wants you to go back to God when
[32:49] you've been in a fish's belly for three
[32:54] nights and so after he was out of the
[32:56] fish's belly a few turn um in chapter 3
[32:58] it says and the word of the Lord came
[33:00] unto Jonah the second time so when God
[33:03] tells you to do something you better
[33:05] listen to him the first time he
[33:06] shouldn't have to tell you a second time
[33:09] and so it says in verse two of chapter 3
[33:13] arise go into Nineveh that great City
[33:15] and preach it unto it unto it the
[33:18] preaching that I B thee so Jonah Rose
[33:20] and W unto Nineveh according to the word
[33:22] of the Lord now Nineveh so after he
[33:26] listens to God L after he's been went
[33:29] through the bells
[33:31] the the fish's stomach and spit out for
[33:35] three days and three nights
[33:37] so so Jonah arose and went to ninva
[33:40] according to the word that of the Lord
[33:42] now Neva was an exceeding great city of
[33:46] three days journey so he also had to
[33:48] travel three days and God and Jonah
[33:52] began to enter into the city a Day's
[33:55] Journey and he cried and said yet 40
[33:57] days and Nineveh shall be overthrown so
[34:00] he's preaching to the people there so
[34:03] the people of Nineveh believed God and
[34:04] proclaimed a fast and put on zck cloth
[34:08] from the greatest of them even to the
[34:09] least of them for word came unto the
[34:12] king of Nineveh and he arose from his
[34:14] throne and laid his robe from him and
[34:16] covered him with sackcloth and sat and
[34:19] Ashes and so they repented right of all
[34:23] their sins and if you go down the chap
[34:28] 4 but Jonah he wasn't happy he wanted
[34:32] the whole city to be destroyed and it
[34:35] says but it displeased Jonah exceedingly
[34:37] and he was very angry and he prayed unto
[34:40] the Lord and say I pray thee Oh Lord was
[34:43] not this my saying when I went yet in my
[34:46] country therefore I fled before tarus
[34:49] for I knew that thou are a gracious God
[34:53] and merciful slow to anger and great
[34:55] kindness and repr and repentance of thee
[34:58] of the evil therefore now oh Lord take I
[35:01] beseth Thee my life from me for it is
[35:03] better for me to die than to live so
[35:05] after all he's been through he wants to
[35:08] die he's asking God to kill him because
[35:11] he wants the city
[35:12] destroyed and so and then the Lord do
[35:17] then said the Lord does thou well to be
[35:20] angry so Jonah went out of the city and
[35:22] sat on the east side of the city and
[35:24] there made him a booth and sat under it
[35:27] in the shallow Shadow till he might see
[35:30] what would become of the city so he was
[35:31] waiting for the whole city to be
[35:33] destroyed because of all his journeys he
[35:35] went through the fish he went journeyed
[35:37] into the
[35:38] City and the Lord prepared a gourd and
[35:42] made it to come over Jonah that it might
[35:45] be a sh Shadow over his head to deliver
[35:48] him from his grief so Jonah was
[35:49] exceedingly glad I mean in that place in
[35:53] the Middle East it's very hot and so I'm
[35:56] sure some shade would really help so the
[36:00] Lord grew it to where it shadowed
[36:04] Jonah and you'd be thankful too I mean
[36:08] it's really hard out
[36:09] there amen
[36:12] and but then God prepared a worm when
[36:15] the morning Rose the next day it smoked
[36:17] the gourd and it withered so the whole
[36:19] gourd was taken out and it's burning up
[36:21] and he's angry and he's been through a
[36:23] well just to get there cuz God said he
[36:25] would destroy the city well the city
[36:28] repented and God accepted the
[36:30] repentance and it came to pass when the
[36:33] sun did rise God
[36:35] prepared a East Wind and the Sun Beat
[36:39] upon the head of Jonah that he fainted
[36:41] and wished himself to die and said it is
[36:44] better for me to die than to live so
[36:45] he's asked God twice or he's told God
[36:47] it's better for him to die than to live
[36:50] because he's been through all the day
[36:52] and he wanted the city to be destroyed
[36:54] right and God said to Jonah do thou be
[36:57] angry dust thou well to be angry for the
[37:01] gourd and he said I do well to be angry
[37:04] even unto death so he just wanted to die
[37:07] he wanted the city to be destroyed since
[37:10] he's been through the fish and it really
[37:12] shows that he was really angry with God
[37:15] and you shouldn't do
[37:17] that and then said the Lord thou Hast
[37:21] had pity on the gourd for which thou
[37:24] Hast not labored so he has even he
[37:27] wasn't the one who grew the gourd God
[37:29] grew the gourd and he sat when he wanted
[37:31] a whole city to be
[37:33] destroyed but he sad because of a gourd
[37:36] that just shattered him so he was sort
[37:38] of selfish right
[37:40] then then said the Lord th PR neither
[37:44] mest It Grow which came up in the night
[37:46] and perished in the night and should not
[37:49] I spare Nineveh that great City where
[37:51] when are more than 6 score thousand
[37:55] persons that cannot
[37:57] desert between their right hand and
[37:59] their left hand and so much
[38:03] cattle it's the end of the
[38:05] chapter and so God was saying to Jonah
[38:11] why feel sad for a gourd when thousands
[38:13] of people's lives could Depend and they
[38:16] repented and God just he spared the city
[38:20] and he wanted Jonah to realize that you
[38:23] could feel sad for a gourd but the
[38:25] thousands you wanted the thousands of
[38:27] people men women children when they
[38:30] repented so he was showing Noah I mean
[38:33] showing Jonah to his face exactly what
[38:37] would happen
[38:48] so good
[38:51] afternoon y'all forgive me I'm a little
[38:55] nervous so today today I'm going to uh
[38:57] I'm going to tell a testimony amen I'm
[39:01] going to tell about
[39:02] uh what was going on in my life uh
[39:06] before I had the Holy Ghost
[39:08] amen
[39:10] um I had I had a lot of
[39:14] uh hard days in my life and I I I was
[39:20] depressed when I was
[39:22] younger and um it was because of Dreams
[39:26] Dre and and uh ter terrible nightmares
[39:31] and uh things I was seeing and and and
[39:35] uh that would happen to me at night and
[39:39] and things and uh you know how little
[39:43] little children they think um you know
[39:46] you know how they think they're monsters
[39:48] in their closet you know things like
[39:50] that well I thought that was
[39:53] true my mom she and Dad they would tell
[39:56] me me there's no such thing as monsters
[39:58] and there there isn't but you see there
[40:02] there there are demons you
[40:03] know and
[40:06] um I I would have these terrible dreams
[40:09] and there was one demon that would
[40:11] torment
[40:12] me every night and he he was in a black
[40:18] cloak and his face was white
[40:23] completely I was so scared of him every
[40:26] time I
[40:26] on I would just want to
[40:30] scream so I would have these dreams
[40:33] where sometimes he would devour devour
[40:35] me and he would uh torture me
[40:40] and uh I I was awake one
[40:44] time and uh it was dark and I was I was
[40:48] scared of the dark you know when I was
[40:51] younger so uh I had the covers over my
[40:55] head so um I heard my closet door
[41:01] open and I heard something walking
[41:04] towards
[41:05] me and I felt something lay its
[41:09] hands they're cold very
[41:13] cold and felt like
[41:17] death and I felt that on my body and
[41:22] it's just like pressure you know it was
[41:24] laid on my body
[41:27] and um I was so
[41:30] scared and uh I I couldn't talk I was in
[41:33] shock just laying there so
[41:37] um then I I heard it walk away and the
[41:42] closet door
[41:44] closed so the next morning I told my mom
[41:47] and she didn't uh she was like now
[41:50] you're just imagining
[41:52] things but uh there was a demon that
[41:56] would torment me and it was torture for
[42:00] me since I was just a little
[42:03] kid
[42:05] and I said I got I got to do something
[42:08] about
[42:09] this so I uh I
[42:12] prayed and
[42:15] um when I was about 9 or
[42:19] 10 I I I kept seeking the Holy Ghost and
[42:23] finally one day I knew I had it amen and
[42:26] all those dreams that I had completely
[42:29] stopped all the torture and everything
[42:32] it was completely
[42:34] gone there was one last dream that I had
[42:37] right
[42:38] before uh I got the Holy Ghost and
[42:44] um it it all those dreams seemed so
[42:49] real and this this one was I don't know
[42:54] why but it was the most terrifying of
[42:57] all but uh I was laying in bed in my
[43:01] dream and
[43:04] um uh I woke
[43:06] up in in my dream and uh the closet door
[43:10] opened and uh so in my dream I I got up
[43:16] out of bed and I looked in the closet
[43:19] and there was that demon with black
[43:21] cloak in the white face and he was just
[43:23] staring at me then the clock door
[43:27] closed and all that stopped amen and I
[43:32] never had a dream with that demon ever
[43:34] since was completely gone
[43:36] Hallelujah I'd been delivered of that
[43:39] and ever since ever since then ever
[43:41] since I got the Holy
[43:43] Ghost I've tried
[43:45] to tell my friends about uh my friends
[43:49] that aren't Christians about about the
[43:50] Lord and and um I was never ever ashamed
[43:55] of what I believed never you should
[43:58] never be ashamed of what you
[44:00] believe so
[44:03] um yeah that's my that's my testimony
[44:07] amen thank
[44:25] you
[44:29] I just asked him a few weeks ago I said
[44:32] would y'all uh like to take a
[44:36] service oh excuse me I'm not on okay I
[44:39] said would y'all like to take a
[44:41] service surprisingly they said yeah I
[44:44] said okay we'll just do it on the the
[44:46] children Sunday and they all take the
[44:49] service and take over I said if you
[44:51] don't spend too long I'll take the rest
[44:53] of it and do whatever you know but I
[44:56] enjoyed what they had to say I told them
[44:58] I said just testify read a scripture
[45:01] speak a little bit do whatever you want
[45:03] to do because they are the
[45:06] future and we don't worry about how long
[45:09] it'll be or what's going on so they're
[45:11] the future to take over that's why we
[45:13] encourage him to get up here and Lead
[45:16] singing and sing and worship and do
[45:20] things why because you know they are the
[45:23] future all of the kids all these little
[45:25] bit ones even the little bitty ones just

[45:30] they're learning and that's that's good
[45:34] we got a lot of little kids coming up
[45:36] you know and doing so we got to we can
[45:39] leave them a a part to where they can
[45:41] have something then that way it won't be
[45:44] just we're in a message that mom and
[45:46] daddy made us have to
[45:49] do they're in a part that they can have
[45:52] a part to do with you know and you and
[45:55] encourage all these kids and things to
[45:58] where that they'll they'll seek the Lord
[46:01] amen until they find him and then it'll
[46:05] be you know it'll be finished so we just
[46:08] appreciate that uh all I wanted to say
[46:11] the rest of the thing is I didn't finish
[46:14] this morning's message so I'll try to
[46:16] finish a little thought with you and uh
[46:20] then we'll just close that I I was
[46:24] trying to make a point with you
[46:28] that you know what caused a problem in
[46:32] the garden was Eve with too many
[46:34] partners too many husbands as we'd call
[46:37] it all right then you turn around in the
[46:40] next stage you see and it polygamy is
[46:44] introduced well don't ever think that
[46:47] polygamy is what was introduced to take
[46:50] away sin because that would be you know
[46:53] double up you would be going into the
[46:56] wrong
[46:57] thing the the
[47:00] sacrifice in the garden was what took
[47:04] away sin there's your atonement your
[47:06] atonement was made for them but you know
[47:11] but God didn't turned around and said
[47:13] well all right I've got that part I've
[47:15] got the uh the sin
[47:18] covered they said now how do I work out
[47:21] my perfect will because he had that he
[47:24] let he allowed us to go into the
[47:26] wrong and he said okay you've done
[47:30] wrong and now it'll be a hard Road and
[47:34] then you can go into the things you know
[47:37] of what was said about it and we earn
[47:39] our living by the sweat of our brow we
[47:42] the women are are bothered in
[47:44] childbearing and things like that and
[47:48] uh but when it's all said and done God
[47:51] is going to have his way amen that's
[47:54] right amen that's sir
[47:56] he'll permit things in a permissive
[47:59] will you say well and that's what a lot
[48:01] of people tell me a lot of times they'll
[48:03] say well I believe the Lord told me to
[48:05] do this and and I don't want to
[48:08] discourage
[48:09] you but I want you to make sure you're
[48:12] right about what you think the Lord told
[48:14] you now if you tell me the Lord told me
[48:17] to go out and do this that or the thing
[48:19] wrong then I'd tell you in a hurry that
[48:22] was not the Lord you know talking to you
[48:24] you you heard another the voice all
[48:26] right but see the thing of it is
[48:29] polygamy was
[48:32] permitted to where that it would bring
[48:36] about the things that would happen the
[48:39] fall brought to pass the Redemption the
[48:42] fall brought to pass you know the the
[48:45] him coming forth
[48:47] himself God coming down and it brought
[48:49] to pass the Redemptive form and it
[48:52] brought to pass the uh there's nothing
[48:55] in polygamy to cover as uh sin uh you
[49:00] know
[49:01] sicknesses uh things like that that's
[49:04] displayed on the basis of God doing it
[49:08] himself through the atonement all right
[49:12] then you know he's a Healer he's a
[49:14] savior he's a redeemer and all like that
[49:17] and see the sex act brought
[49:20] death well don't ever relate any form of
[49:24] sex act to to bring in
[49:27] Redemption because it's not it's not in
[49:31] there for you to think about that and so
[49:34] you can say well I I believe the Lord
[49:36] told me this that or the other make sure
[49:40] that it's right with the word of
[49:42] God make sure you're right in there
[49:46] because if you're
[49:48] not then you're in a worser trap than
[49:51] Eve was in the garden and that's why it
[49:53] says lest the Devil tempt you like he
[49:55] did Eve you know to tell you a lie to
[49:59] tell you you're okay that's why I I
[50:02] stand before a church with a lot of
[50:05] problems saying marriage and divorce you
[50:08] know issues that have been there and all
[50:10] I can do is tell you you search God for
[50:14] an answer because I can't give you one
[50:18] if you ask me I must lay it down
[50:21] according to this line right here which
[50:23] is the word of God I I can't I won't
[50:27] deviate from it I will tell you what
[50:30] this
[50:31] says you know all right but then you
[50:34] must come to the place of of seeking God
[50:37] for the right answer for yourselves cuz
[50:41] that way you can search out the Lord
[50:42] because see grace is what brought the
[50:47] atonement all right you see why I just
[50:49] brought a half a message and I told you
[50:51] I wanted to keep it this to the Old
[50:52] Testament part of to where that when it
[50:56] polygamy was introduced The Prophet
[50:59] said and look what it done it even went
[51:02] into the animal
[51:04] kingdom why would it do
[51:06] that why would it go into the animal
[51:08] kingdom until you'd see those things you
[51:12] know because the animal was a part of
[51:16] the original
[51:18] happening which was the Beast all right
[51:22] so then being the Beast see and I
[51:24] remember a brought around and said he
[51:26] said see there he said animal was a part
[51:29] used in the fall he said thereby then it
[51:33] would come into the part of
[51:35] atonement you know because the animals
[51:38] back there would be sacrificed as a part
[51:41] of the atonement because they were part
[51:42] of that they had nothing to do with it
[51:44] as far as volunteering anything but that
[51:47] doesn't have anything to do with it it's
[51:48] the way God does things and you can't
[51:51] question how he does it right so then as
[51:54] I said now now then Eve with too many
[51:57] partners you can't come over and say
[51:59] well God just got mad at Eve and just
[52:01] said well I'm going to fix it I'm going
[52:03] to give Adam the right to have all the
[52:05] wise he wants now God didn't do
[52:09] that we'll get more into the scriptures
[52:11] the Lord willing Wednesday and some
[52:13] things that God doesn't work like
[52:17] that you may think sometimes that you're
[52:20] punished for what you're do what you've
[52:22] done wrong and it may be true but it's
[52:25] not always
[52:27] true you know just because you're sick
[52:30] doesn't mean you're
[52:32] lost you know cuz you have troubles
[52:34] doesn't mean you're
[52:36] lost it means we're under the
[52:39] curse to where that things are happening
[52:42] so then get away from those deals of
[52:44] that but see you can't as I tried to
[52:46] make the point see why did polygamy come
[52:48] into view it came into view to display
[52:51] the point of God showing you know that
[52:55] through the the man having more than one
[52:58] wife that would show a type of Christ in
[53:00] the
[53:01] church all right and see then once as I
[53:05] ended up talking about it once you come
[53:07] to that place
[53:10] that we're at Calvary you know and then
[53:13] look day of Pentecost coming on the day
[53:16] of Pentecost to me now the way I look at
[53:19] it I believe it that man and wife was
[53:21] restored back like it should have been
[53:24] in the beginning all right see that
[53:28] would put you back to that place not to
[53:30] not to just say the new birth does away
[53:32] with everything of the body cuz we've
[53:33] taught that we've got to come down in
[53:35] the end time to find out how to do away
[53:37] with a lot of these problems in the body
[53:41] that we have but as far as the soul of
[53:43] the
[53:44] individual when that Holy Ghost came
[53:46] back on the day of
[53:48] Pentecost it set the hearts of those
[53:50] people into an
[53:53] order of Christ and in the church Paul
[53:56] would be specific about it and she said
[53:59] talking about the wife to do this and
[54:01] the husband he said and I'm speaking of
[54:03] Christ in the
[54:05] church it's not a polygamy point now
[54:08] that's where that when it come to the
[54:10] New Testament see you don't have
[54:12] polygamy right now we will hold one
[54:15] pointed I won't say no more on but you
[54:18] got to remember that as we'll pick it up
[54:20] Wednesday the Lord willing you got to
[54:22] remember
[54:24] that
[54:26] there's still a uh what do you call it
[54:30] uh
[54:31] effects uh what is another word you
[54:34] could use that there is start still a
[54:36] part about the the uh polygamy deal that
[54:41] we've got to deal with not that it's
[54:44] okay uh-uh now get that out of your mind
[54:48] get it out of your mind that polygamy is
[54:50] okay because it won't work the prophet
[54:52] said no it's wrong but we're still under
[54:55] the part to where like the prophet said
[54:58] he can but she
[55:02] can't now that gets under a point that
[55:05] we'll cover more Wednesday night but the
[55:08] main thing I want to to talk about just
[55:10] for a minute is the fact of of we see
[55:12] that God's plan and purpose for our
[55:16] lives has been fulfilled was fulfilled
[55:19] back there to try to bring it or to
[55:22] start away for it to come back from the
[55:25] permissive will to the perfect will all
[55:29] right now remember
[55:31] this polygamy is under the permissive
[55:35] right amen you haven't got to the
[55:37] perfect don't think that don't think you
[55:39] went from this over here as permissive
[55:42] and then you come to polygamy and you're
[55:44] under no no you're still under
[55:46] permissive will that's right the perfect
[55:49] wheel was on the day of Pentecost when
[55:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost came into
[55:53] the heart of that individ indidual to
[55:56] set that individual free from sin now it
[56:00] didn't make no difference if that
[56:02] individual was married or or whatever
[56:05] you know it what it didn't matter it
[56:08] could have been somebody in the upper
[56:09] room you know just uh married one of the
[56:13] brothers could have been there that was
[56:14] married but his wife wasn't there
[56:16] receive the Holy Ghost she had to get
[56:17] her own Holy Ghost and see in this you
[56:20] got to have your own salvation not just
[56:22] a point of of thinking about well we're
[56:25] in this situation here no no don't blame
[56:30] polygamy don't talk about polygamy as
[56:33] being anything it was just
[56:37] introduced into the human race right
[56:40] well I now look and it went on over into
[56:42] the Animal
[56:44] Kingdom right the polygamy but now when
[56:48] it come to
[56:49] Calvary as far as Christ and the
[56:53] individual yes I I say Calvary because
[56:55] of the day of Pentecost what I'm talking
[56:56] about right when the day of Pentecost
[56:59] came the
[57:00] individual went from topes and
[57:04] shadows right into the
[57:08] reality of the new birth all right which
[57:11] made Christ and his church inside of you
[57:16] all right but then it's a many membered
[57:19] body so then he's got many members to
[57:22] that so it goes out and he brings in
[57:24] many more and there was 120 the first
[57:27] time but each one of those received the
[57:30] person of Jesus
[57:31] Christ in spirit form into them the new
[57:35] birth all right but see then to show
[57:38] that it was going to go on and he hadn't
[57:40] finished all of it even though he was
[57:43] bringing it to his perfect will as far
[57:45] as the
[57:47] soul right now far as a soul on the day
[57:50] of Pentecost the day you receive the
[57:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost that soul is
[57:56] eternal all right that Soul doesn't have
[57:59] to have anything to make it
[58:02] perfect it's perfect by the new birth it
[58:05] has a growth development that needs to
[58:07] be going into into the statue of a
[58:09] perfect man yes but as far as the
[58:11] Perfection of that and see then when you
[58:14] come to that it's Christ and his
[58:19] church because each individual
[58:23] represents Christ in his church are you
[58:25] following me 120 in the upper room each
[58:28] one of them represented Christ and his
[58:33] church all right but now then as a whole
[58:36] you back off and look at it or whatever
[58:38] you want to do and you see that it's a
[58:40] many membered
[58:42] body go what are you going to do with
[58:45] 120 of them all just
[58:48] alike you know right 120 Born Again
[58:53] Christians see now you you put them into
[58:55] the
[58:57] body as a many membered body you know
[59:01] one body many member all right and now
[59:05] you can look at polygamy not in the form
[59:08] of of uh one man and many
[59:13] wives you look at it as Christ and his
[59:16] church it doesn't doesn't run into the
[59:19] human race you know what I mean it
[59:21] doesn't come on down past
[59:25] they're at the upper room when the Holy
[59:27] Ghost fell right right from there on
[59:30] down is Christ in his church which is
[59:32] one individual and Christ right but each
[59:38] individual then is an an
[59:41] individual all right then we make up the
[59:44] body of
[59:46] Christ right which is a many membered
[59:49] body and you see then that polygamy is
[59:52] not legal today
[59:55] amen but it holds a part that that it
[59:58] spoke of back there in the Old
[1:00:01] Testament as being
[1:00:04] permitted to speak of Christ in the
[1:00:06] church all right then you couldn't just
[1:00:08] say that it's one man and one woman and
[1:00:12] leave it as a whole because you would
[1:00:13] only have one person saved that's right
[1:00:16] all right but when you get into the New
[1:00:19] Testament with the body of Christ each
[1:00:22] individual in that body of Christ is a
[1:00:25] person with God together that's hard to
[1:00:28] understand right hard to comprehend but
[1:00:30] it's
[1:00:31] true you know all right see then that
[1:00:35] way each man and woman can type Christ
[1:00:37] in the
[1:00:38] church now if they're correct there's
[1:00:42] where your marriage and divorce has to
[1:00:43] come in the marriage and divorce
[1:00:46] situation has to come in to where that
[1:00:48] if you can accept the grace you can be
[1:00:50] brought that way but a man and many
[1:00:52] wives can't type it
[1:00:55] see amen it won't work a woman with many
[1:00:59] husbands won't work
[1:01:01] that's then it comes down to the basis
[1:01:04] that she can never marry again right
[1:01:08] because of the
[1:01:10] Fall now if her husband be dead we read
[1:01:13] the scripture she's free to marry only
[1:01:16] in the Lord so if his wife has died he
[1:01:20] can marry only in the Lord right all
[1:01:23] right right but if there's a reason for
[1:01:26] him to be able to
[1:01:29] scripturally put her
[1:01:32] away then he
[1:01:34] can and marry
[1:01:37] again right and see then it's still in
[1:01:41] the type because we'll get to it
[1:01:44] Wednesday more of doing it and talk
[1:01:46] about the husband of one
[1:01:51] wife what about a person could stand up
[1:01:56] up I know that's talking about a bishop
[1:01:59] and and a deacon and I know what your
[1:02:01] rules are there but I'm using it as an
[1:02:06] example that a man could stand up that
[1:02:08] he had been married five times each time
[1:02:11] legally put away scripturally put away
[1:02:15] he only has one wife
[1:02:18] right cuz you're not trying to type
[1:02:21] anymore you get what I'm saying once you
[1:02:24] pred in the New
[1:02:26] Birth that settled a
[1:02:29] tying the rest of it is just the hold
[1:02:33] over or the part to use to where that
[1:02:36] when you get into this natural life then
[1:02:39] you look at Christ in his
[1:02:41] church and you say thank you
[1:02:44] Lord for showing me how free I can
[1:02:49] be because that's the only thing in the
[1:02:51] grace of marriage and divorce right so
[1:02:54] you can't go kill your
[1:02:56] husband you know and say well I'm free
[1:03:00] he's dead now you're
[1:03:02] murderer so what's a what's it
[1:03:06] doing but if he can let it
[1:03:10] die now what's your point there if he
[1:03:13] can let it die you realize the new birth
[1:03:16] if you received it he let that ow
[1:03:19] you through justification sanctification
[1:03:23] the bap gives with the Holy Ghost he let
[1:03:26] that old you
[1:03:29] die not die like dying like we think
[1:03:32] about it's the nature and the doings and
[1:03:35] the beings of that person and we talking
[1:03:38] about the other day when he give you a
[1:03:39] new heart and your spirit he doesn't
[1:03:42] take your heart out he Mellows the heart
[1:03:45] with his
[1:03:46] goodness all right the goodness of God
[1:03:49] leadth thee to repentance the Bible says
[1:03:53] see then we can get down to see that
[1:03:56] really David with all of his
[1:03:59] wives he could type Christ in the church
[1:04:02] but just
[1:04:03] remember not one of them
[1:04:08] women could
[1:04:11] marry another
[1:04:15] man but now you better remember
[1:04:18] something
[1:04:22] else David
[1:04:25] and I know the quote run said he married
[1:04:26] man any woman he wanted
[1:04:28] to that's true only in the
[1:04:38] Lord maybe you hadn't thought about
[1:04:41] that David couldn't go down and just
[1:04:43] take a man's wife away from
[1:04:46] him that's where his trouble was with
[1:04:50] basba he took away the wife
[1:04:55] he thought he'd cover it by letting as I
[1:04:58] said a while ago you know you kill your
[1:04:59] husband you're
[1:05:02] free David had that idea to start with
[1:05:06] right he had what's his namei he had him
[1:05:09] killed then he made a great show in
[1:05:12] front of the
[1:05:14] public right that he loved you so much
[1:05:18] until look at him now he's going to take
[1:05:20] his
[1:05:21] wife as to be and that's one when the
[1:05:25] prophet came to him and said
[1:05:29] David David look what you've
[1:05:33] done but look at Grace all at once that
[1:05:35] Prophet said but David you won't die
[1:05:40] because it was supposed to been death y
[1:05:42] right am we'll pick up a few things
[1:05:45] Wednesday and talk about it but just
[1:05:47] remember David we think he could go
[1:05:49] marry anybody there Earth were your Old
[1:05:51] Testament s people was wrong
[1:05:55] and that's what they said to
[1:05:57] Jesus said we can put our wife away for
[1:06:00] anything and marry again he said from
[1:06:04] the beginning it wasn't
[1:06:06] so and will not be so in the
[1:06:10] end you when you think a guy went up
[1:06:13] there there and he said I don't like her
[1:06:15] she's
[1:06:16] ugly you know I'll just put her away and
[1:06:19] marry another one now according to God
[1:06:21] he's living in adultery right
[1:06:24] I don't care what your law says he was
[1:06:26] allowed to do the law had nothing to do
[1:06:28] with God's word even though they used it
[1:06:31] for their own benefit to put away their
[1:06:34] wives for any cause if you don't have a
[1:06:37] scriptural reason listen this is what we
[1:06:40] got to get to if you don't have a
[1:06:42] scriptural reason for divorcing a
[1:06:46] woman just divorcing her without a
[1:06:49] scriptural reason can put you in a bad
[1:06:51] shape cuz she will go and marry again
[1:06:54] and you cause her to commit
[1:06:57] adultery there's not everybody that just
[1:06:59] say well it was I just me and my wife
[1:07:02] couldn't get along I just divorced her
[1:07:04] and married again you got two two living
[1:07:06] persons I don't care who you are that's
[1:07:09] right you better find some Grace
[1:07:11] somewhere you got two living
[1:07:14] people well I I I done it according to
[1:07:16] the word word
[1:07:20] says except it be for
[1:07:22] fornication
[1:07:25] you see why we wasn't taught correctly
[1:07:28] through any of our lives in organized
[1:07:30] religion and we just done what they
[1:07:32] thought was right and then you come in
[1:07:34] this message and the people do what they
[1:07:36] think is right and then you say
[1:07:39] something you ain't going to tell me I'm
[1:07:40] not free no I ain't going to tell you
[1:07:43] and I ain't going to try cuz you ain't
[1:07:45] going to
[1:07:47] listen if you don't have that's the
[1:07:49] point I want to drive if you don't have
[1:07:51] a scriptural reason or Old Testament are
[1:07:57] new if you don't have a scriptural
[1:08:00] reason for divorcing you can't remarry
[1:08:04] Old Testament or new
[1:08:09] testament so if David I know he married
[1:08:12] Abigail which would have not been right
[1:08:14] with a priest coming down to thing but
[1:08:16] David wasn't a priest but I believe
[1:08:17] that's her name right Abigail that he
[1:08:19] married her but remember her husband was
[1:08:22] dead
[1:08:25] so scripturally he was
[1:08:28] okay all right we will get into that
[1:08:32] more Wednesday night because I love to
[1:08:34] of a point
[1:08:36] there but think about it God will take
[1:08:40] his permissive
[1:08:42] will allow things to
[1:08:45] happen allowed us to be born by sex
[1:08:48] allowed all these things to come into
[1:08:50] being allowed
[1:08:52] polygamy to come come into
[1:08:55] a allowing things and he'll make it work
[1:08:59] out for his perfect
[1:09:00] will but I hope you understand what I'm
[1:09:02] driving
[1:09:04] at when you receive the new
[1:09:09] birth that don't clear
[1:09:11] everything oh now there's where people
[1:09:14] get it you know they think the new birth
[1:09:16] clears everything people think the new
[1:09:18] birth clears their marriage and divorce
[1:09:20] problem if it does then why did Brother
[1:09:23] run them out to preach
[1:09:25] soling that you don't know why I make
[1:09:28] those statements I make the statement
[1:09:30] because like I talking to somebody a
[1:09:31] while
[1:09:32] ago they can't be no other way right you
[1:09:36] tell me they
[1:09:37] can well that solves it that's it yeah
[1:09:42] but brother I think it's I don't give up
[1:09:45] what you
[1:09:48] think if I can stand with the word of
[1:09:50] God and say this is it I'm not even
[1:09:53] worried about your
[1:09:55] arguments I'm not concerned about it I'm
[1:09:58] standing with the
[1:10:01] word all right but see David then could
[1:10:06] have more than one wife but
[1:10:10] remember it had to be a scriptural
[1:10:15] reason we think he just go marry any
[1:10:18] woman he wanted to
[1:10:20] uhuh he couldn't go out and have
[1:10:22] somebody killed and take his wife
[1:10:26] uhuh brother R said Remember the law of
[1:10:30] of of marriage and divorce is so
[1:10:32] straight he said that's why that
[1:10:37] King when he found
[1:10:39] out that Abraham was Sarah's husband he
[1:10:44] said look what you put me
[1:10:47] in he said that is your wife he said
[1:10:51] that is a law even among among the
[1:10:54] Heathen he
[1:10:56] said that you can't go along just
[1:10:59] anything the Bible's
[1:11:01] right the Bible tells us how to
[1:11:04] divorce and how and why we could
[1:11:09] remarry but just
[1:11:11] remember the woman can't divorce her
[1:11:15] husband and she can't remarry unless
[1:11:18] he's
[1:11:19] dead because of what happened in the
[1:11:22] garden that part is still held
[1:11:25] there to where it's still dependent and
[1:11:28] you and I are still held under that same
[1:11:35] situation because it that way you wind
[1:11:37] up living in
[1:11:40] adultery but you see why polygamy come
[1:11:42] into view was as to type Christ in the
[1:11:46] church not to set the church
[1:11:48] free polygamy doesn't set the church
[1:11:51] free the blood of Jesus Christ is what
[1:11:53] sets you
[1:11:56] free polygamy was just
[1:12:00] allowed to where it would be for a time
[1:12:04] wise but we're still in the bases that
[1:12:07] as far as Christ and his body is
[1:12:10] concerned that she's a many membered
[1:12:12] body and when we get over on that other
[1:12:15] side do you know that it'll be
[1:12:18] Christ and a many membered
[1:12:21] bride amen
[1:12:24] all I'm going to say it and I'm going to
[1:12:27] quit
[1:12:29] because that
[1:12:31] way you can keep things running
[1:12:37] straight you can't keep it running
[1:12:39] straight to way our thoughts are a lot
[1:12:41] of
[1:12:43] times like I said to start with maybe
[1:12:45] that doesn't mean anything to
[1:12:48] you but
[1:12:51] Eve with two partners
[1:12:54] caus to
[1:13:00] fall God
[1:13:02] permitted polygamy to come into
[1:13:06] being now what if he hadn't permitted it
[1:13:09] to come into
[1:13:10] being last
[1:13:13] question what if God had not permitted
[1:13:17] polygamy you already had the display of
[1:13:19] his attributes as healer savior Etc
[1:13:22] don't get that all
[1:13:24] involved that was through the
[1:13:27] atonement if polygamy had not been
[1:13:30] instituted there would have been no
[1:13:32] Christ in his
[1:13:37] church right they would have been a
[1:13:39] Christ in one
[1:13:44] person but yet because of the allowing
[1:13:47] of
[1:13:48] polygamy it would put in Institute a
[1:13:52] type that would last until the world is
[1:13:56] over that Christ and his church would be
[1:14:01] one just remember brother R said he can
[1:14:03] put us away anytime he wants to that's
[1:14:06] right he said he proved it in the days
[1:14:09] of Luther he put them away because it
[1:14:12] wouldn't continue he said and he married
[1:14:14] to
[1:14:15] Methodist he put them away because they
[1:14:17] wouldn't continue married to Pentecostal
[1:14:20] so you go through the Baptist the
[1:14:21] Presbyterians the different churches
[1:14:23] does it come forth you
[1:14:26] know it's a great thing and a great
[1:14:29] understanding to me because it takes
[1:14:31] away anything related to any form of
[1:14:36] like the people of the message will say
[1:14:38] so you don't believe in in polygamy to
[1:14:41] look out there in the yard that there is
[1:14:44] a rooster and a whole lot of
[1:14:46] hens that's
[1:14:52] true you know that that animal's
[1:14:56] body came out of the same
[1:15:00] Earth you came out
[1:15:03] of and when that
[1:15:06] Earth is completely
[1:15:10] redeemed this first right that's right
[1:15:14] come on am I right this part of the
[1:15:16] Earth has got to be fully redeemed in a
[1:15:19] Rapture then the real Earth can be
[1:15:22] redeemed
[1:15:25] and then it'll be
[1:15:27] right everything will be back in order
[1:15:29] the way it should have been to start
[1:15:32] with but we should never get a thought
[1:15:35] in our
[1:15:36] mind of any form of thinking today that
[1:15:42] polygam is okay I can go do this
[1:15:45] remember your problem is when you go do
[1:15:48] this and say I'm going to do
[1:15:52] this
[1:15:53] because you're thinking it out trying to
[1:15:56] figure it out trying to make an
[1:15:59] excuse well it's okay for
[1:16:04] David it's a different
[1:16:07] Covenant won't work today we're under a
[1:16:10] covenant today of one man and one
[1:16:16] woman you got to consider that it is you
[1:16:20] and Christ together as persons amen and
[1:16:23] it's not you and your husband and Christ
[1:16:29] together you and
[1:16:31] Christ then when it's all
[1:16:34] finished and the story is
[1:16:38] completed then it can be a many membered
[1:16:43] body because that's where it started
[1:16:45] back
[1:16:46] there and the top is not fulfilled in
[1:16:51] flesh I hope hope you're
[1:16:54] listening animal come out of the ground
[1:16:56] we come out of the ground it's not
[1:16:58] finished in flesh until we walk off this
[1:17:00] Earth and until we walk off of this
[1:17:03] Earth we're going to deal
[1:17:05] with whether you like it or not we're
[1:17:08] going to deal with
[1:17:12] polygamy because we're going to have
[1:17:15] people that have not followed the laws
[1:17:19] of the
[1:17:21] word to what is a
[1:17:25] wedding and what of these things are you
[1:17:29] know we haven't walked according to this
[1:17:33] so we better believe in
[1:17:35] grace right not disgrace right but line
[1:17:41] it up correctly it comes out to be a
[1:17:42] beautiful picture they get
[1:17:45] wrong and we got a garbage
[1:17:48] can he trying to say I'm telling you
[1:17:51] what the prophet said
[1:17:54] that's what people want to do isn't it
[1:17:57] I'm just saying what he says well okay
[1:18:00] Judas went and hung yourself you go do
[1:18:03] likewise I just told you what the Bible
[1:18:06] said but we don't want
[1:18:09] that
[1:18:11] right but you know what I done I took
[1:18:13] two scriptures to make my
[1:18:17] point then we say I just said what the
[1:18:19] prophet said I've eat that for 50
[1:18:24] years the two Soul people said that the
[1:18:27] seventh under virture people said that
[1:18:29] the perusia said that right brother Ray
[1:18:32] they all said this is what the Lord laid
[1:18:35] on my heart to be the
[1:18:40] truth and the biggest portion of them
[1:18:43] went after
[1:18:47] polygamy showed what kind of spirit it
[1:18:51] was
[1:18:54] if anything do you and I let's keep it
[1:18:58] straight because we're going to face
[1:19:01] him I enjoyed these boys I thought they
[1:19:04] done a marvelous
[1:19:08] job because they're in
[1:19:12] training and we're going to need
[1:19:14] them well we're not going to be around
[1:19:16] here that
[1:19:17] long that's what people said 40 years
[1:19:21] ago right
[1:19:23] a lot of people 40 years ago said that
[1:19:27] we're still here 40 years from now these
[1:19:30] boys would be on up in their
[1:19:35] 50s
[1:19:37] right thank God for these kids that will
[1:19:42] get up and sing and worship and tell
[1:19:45] what they believe amen thank God for
[1:19:48] them let's Stand
[1:19:50] Together come ahead music Ians come
[1:19:53] ahead let's just sing and
[1:19:56] worship I told him I said y'all just
[1:19:59] take your time whatever you want and
[1:20:01] I'll finish up a little bit on a thought
[1:20:04] CU it give me an opportunity to finish
[1:20:07] this morning's message and not leave you
[1:20:09] dangling to go home and wondering just
[1:20:13] remember polygamy don't straighten
[1:20:15] things
[1:20:16] up right the atonement straightens
[1:20:19] things up
[1:20:21] amen the de of Christ straightened
[1:20:24] things
[1:20:26] up that's right but look what a
[1:20:28] situation you'd have had back
[1:20:32] there that when Eve messed
[1:20:34] up if God hadn't
[1:20:37] instituted or introduced The Prophet
[1:20:40] said
[1:20:42] polygamy to where there'd be tops and
[1:20:47] shadows but just remember we are not in
[1:20:51] the tops and shadows
[1:20:53] anymore we are in the
[1:20:56] reality that does not give us a right to
[1:21:00] just do
[1:21:01] anything we still got to be by the word
[1:21:05] okay boys what we got want to be
[1:21:08] wonderful go ahead won't it be wonderful
[1:21:10] page

[1:21:21] that having no burdens to
[1:21:25] be Jo singing with heart Bells all ring
[1:21:31] oh it be wonderful
[1:21:36] there think about it won't it be
[1:21:39] wonderful when we get

[1:21:44] made
[1:21:47] right everything will be in
[1:21:51] order won't be taing no
[1:21:55] more see when we get there we don't have
[1:21:58] to we'll know that it'll be
[1:22:00] there but in the
[1:22:02] Kingdom there is neither male nor
[1:22:06] female in the kingdom of
[1:22:09] God well that makes it a wonderful thing
[1:22:12] doesn't
[1:22:16] it with
