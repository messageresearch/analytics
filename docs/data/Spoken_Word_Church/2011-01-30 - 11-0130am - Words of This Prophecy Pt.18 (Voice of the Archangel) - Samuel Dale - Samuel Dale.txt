lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn the word we've been reading in revelations 1 and then we will go to revelations 4 revelation 1 and then we'll go to revelations 4. remember the lord willing brother dale smith will be with us wednesday preaching vars so keep him in your prayers and also remember this will be the coming up first saturday will be the bible study it's six o'clock so

it's a banquet time for you it's a joyous time amen okay revelation 1 revelations 4 heavenly father we thank you for all things and we know that you give them to us freely but then you told us to ask and we shall receive you said you knew what we had need of before we prayed but yet you still tell us to ask so we just asked lord not a miss to consume it upon our lust as the word says but to be able to lord let you guide each one of us into the correct way and guide us now and teach us to wait upon you bless those that are not here and let your love be with each one and father as we speak about you we ask that you would just open our understanding to thy word and all of those that hear lord by way of internet and by by the the time later lord of some being with us even today we ask you to just bless and let your love be with each one we love you and we thank you keep us in your grace in jesus name amen revelations 1 maybe we'll get off of this in another message or so but we'll see says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must come must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his angel unto his servant john who by a record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now let's go over to revelations 4 1. it says after this now the prophet says that after the church ages all right you you go through one two and three so you get two and three gets the church ages covering after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come on up hither and i will show thee things which must be hereafter and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one said on the throne and he that set was to look upon like a jasper and started in stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne inside of insight like unto an emerald amen you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we kind of put in a little thought there wednesday night you know just had a little message on prayer and things and but we just kind of injected that as a thought in the middle of our our series that we've been going on you know but see we've covered pretty well now revelations one we haven't went through you know at all like we need to i'm sure that but we've covered it and we didn't read the church ages you know but we have been talking about the church ages and and the things of of what is transpiring and you know so it's bringing it down and whatever the point we've been trying to make is that jesus didn't know these things when he was up on earth about his part in the kingdom he didn't know about uh you know his coming and all and that's what we've been trying to cover that when he comes here to john on patmos then now he does know that see after his death burial his resurrection and everything now he knows so he's coming it's not two gods or whatever it's god's way of doing things i wish you would get that in your mind that uh say what do you mean jesus being y'all say jesus was god but yet he didn't know everything well do you know everything oh well all right since no solve the problem but see that's what we because when you start doing things like that you think you do know all things okay maybe i shouldn't say those things but i will because when you when you're trying to figure out something you're trying to say that god didn't have it right all right but he had no other way of doing it we've been through that and he has made it manifest all right now see then he would know the lord jesus christ knew who he was he said unless you believe that i am he you'll die in your sins but there was something withholding from him which would have been the coming of his coming uh you know in his second coming and it would also be his future work in the church ages to come and even on down through into the future all the way to the future home the ending of all things all right but he he's come here to patmos to bring these things to uh the church yeah that's who it's directed to because it's given to john and it was given by the angel messenger and we've been through that to cover you know the messenger and what the messengers are and and the things but i want to emphasize that he's covering here to be written to where we could have it all right that was why i put a a couple of messages in there about the writing of the bible because uh how would we have known these things had it not been that he chose this way to bring it unto us you know see because we would have had the writings of the apostles we would have had those things but we would have not had the church ages and the future part of life or time you know on down and all that so he's he's been so marvelously gracious to give us the book of revelations to where we would actually know then the future and all the way down showing us all the ways i said to the future home all right now now jesus christ knew one thing he knew that he came to die all right he came to die and to be able to do that he would die to give his life now just a little small background to bring his life to where that he could come and live in you and me you know he knew that had to be that way there was no other way for it to come other than to do that and that that would bring forth then the father's strong our domain it would not bring forth the domain that he came and spoke of the kingdom he would speak of and and like the little sister there wanted her children to set boys you know sit one on one side in your kingdom and all and he said that's not for me not to you know be be understood or be given at this time but one of these days it will all right now we know that the father strong was the the baptism of the holy ghost down to the church ages all right and that was what he come to make way for or his kingdom see but one day there will be a kingdom on earth which will be the millennial reign all right and that was the point that was being made because that was what was told to to uh david there in uh what is second samuel 7 and 16 where he said thy kingdom shall be established forever or ever me and he showing him that it would be done and it was speaking of the coming forth of solomon in the natural right to sit on the throne of david all right but mainly speaking of the coming of jesus christ and how that he would come and one day he would sit jesus christ will sit on the throne of david to rule and reign in the millennial reign all right in doing that see it's a fulfillment of scriptures all right there were certain things jesus understood but certain things he didn't understand because it was not made known to him okay in that way see we we look at it as understanding then how god is revealing himself but are you getting what i'm talking about now that he first came to make way now we gave you number one there on one little bethlehem on your notes to word it was talking about david uh was the great anointed one you know and all but he was speaking really of the promised spiritual seed and he swore an oath that christ would sit on the throne of david all right it's a spiritual seed solomon set there at a natural but solomon's kingdom came to an end right see because it ended as far as when he died that was his kingdom you know it went on to somebody else but still it was an end to it and uh you know but she was promised the throne to sit on all right then we get there in the church ages you know he that overcomes and sit with me and my throne you know sit with my father in his throne then we'll overcome and sit with him in his throne and that's showing that in the last day something would take place upon the earth that we want to cover in a few minutes but you know but but i want to you to to uh to see something because i believe this is the point we need to to cover all right now that's why the in the scriptures you don't see him called the lord jesus when he was on earth he kept saying son of man son of man all right and see they didn't understand that they understood the point don't mismiss me now they understood the point that son of man in the basis of that it would be prophetic they understood that part now don't misunderstand when i say they didn't understand they understood that it would be a prophetic doing and they look for the messiah to be you know the christ the prophet that was promised to come by moses you know that god would raise up a prophet like unto me if you don't hear him see you'll be cut off now they understood that point but they didn't understand what he was actually making doing see they was looking for some kind of a conqueror some kind of something like that to be the messiah instead of looking at a little man that would be pushed around and seemingly run over all through his life and you know and everything and and they couldn't comprehend that you know had he come out killing the romans and fighting they would have probably a big portion of people joined in with him but because of him coming the way he come you know it would be that way but he had to come that way because how would the holy spirit ever come to the church you know i've got a message coming behind this on the soul and you know the things and predestination it'll be on over in a few weeks but i'll make this statement to you the the the soul of god was not seen in full manifestation in the old testament because if it had been i'll make the point then we'll come back to it because if it had been you would have been able to brought it into man but it wasn't no way to do it because it wouldn't you can't bring it out like that so we'll get to that later all right but now what i want you to see is he knew that he must die to release the life that was in him and that's what those pharisees and teachers and things they couldn't understand that right yet they would sing you know they pierced my hands and my feet they would read the scriptures of looking at it from isaiah on the different ones you know and they would see those things in the bible but they couldn't understand that here was their god that was going to come and die right and we're the only group of people in the world of any form of religion that has a god that many had to die all the others want some kind of doing this or some kind of doing that but our god had to die to release his life because he had not done that well see then he had to come then the son of man all right and he'd have to declare himself as son of man all right now we get down to it in a minute the reason why that has to be in the in the in the order but he had to be known as son of man because that way he would die son of man and he would raise son of god to come down to the church ages now we know it was the son of man that died it was the son of man body that was raised up sure we understand but that's not the story to be able to follow it that he died son of man he couldn't die son of god he had to die to release that life so while he was here up on this earth brother branham let's see i've got it in here at a while he said who is this son of man he said in the beginning was the word word was with god and the word was god now the son of god the spirit the logos the theophany god was dwelling inside of that flesh but when that time was here that he was on earth he was to be full fulfilling the son of man right all right then see none of your scholars understood that none of your people back there understood it um even after uh you know matthew mark luke and john writing other things and saying son of man you hear paul mentioning it not whatsoever i'm sure he probably thought of it and talked on it or whatever but it's not in the word of god because they would not understand what son of man meant the son of man would be the prophet all right as i said now they could understand that part they could understand that that a prophet was to come all right because they believed in their prophets but they didn't understand that this prophet would be god that's the part they couldn't comprehend and why he would keep saying son of man and why he would say to uh you know like pilate or whoever it was there when he said you know uh you know they say you're a king or you're a king he said unto that end i was born not that right then right and see he didn't worry about him because he said you know if if it was time in other words my people would fight but i'm not here to fight you pilot i'm not here to or pharaoh everybody is i get all them mixed up but he was telling him you know i've not come to do that now well he just turned him loose you know he wanted to free him because he couldn't see any uh connection of what uh you know would be uh any threat to it so he was willing to turn him loose but the jews wouldn't let him all right but now see he had to die he had to bring forth the father's strong and to do that many would have to die in flesh to release what was inside of him where that that was inside of him could come back up on the church on the day of pentecost in the baptism of the holy ghost so now we believe in many forms many ways god manifests himself but we don't believe in many gods because see we keep it in the order of one true and living god all right so then what did he do i gave you that on the unveiling of god number two and you know it's where it's talking about when the holy spirit came and he's talking about god being the spirit he was the holy spirit right son of god he lived through the church ages the son of god now in the millennium he'd be son of david because he's already with cain as son of man look like a paragraph a book now remember this is a very important part remember between the son of god and the ladies in age they put him out and in luke he said he would be revealed again the son of man the prophet fulfilling the rest of it said the scriptures are perfect it's the same god all the time just changing his form in morphe all right now what did he do he came to die the son of god could not come into the new birth could not come into the people until the death of the testators is that true we see it even in the old testament was required the death of an animal to make a sacrifice so that it meant that that god would have to come and die in flesh not die as god that's where that's my god can't die you know well you can't die either i can blow your head slap off you can't die that's that's not it you're gonna go somewhere else and wait a while see that's where we think we're really so smart we're using our terminologies when we show our stupidity in what we're doing but see one day he will sit upon the throne of david in the millennium all right but now if he's son of god then the catch is that see he would come as son of god the baptism of the holy ghost now as i said he could not come as son of god right there when he walked on earth and say i'm the son of god that would require uh or made a way or started a form to where that that some way he could enter into us right and everybody would just get anointed but that wasn't the story it requires the death to release the soul all right so now you understand it that way so i didn't understand it this way see then down to the ages he would be son of god all right but then right at the end time luke 17 30 would start being spoken about this prophet only that said you don't have the writers they don't write very little about the son of man you might find some here and yonder would mention something but the the catch is that he would have to come back in the end time and son of man now there's the thing that that the theologians that the writers and all they couldn't follow that line right but he's to come back in the end time thing and to do that he's gonna have to come back as son of man because you can't go from son of god to the millennium no more than you could go from son of god to the baptism of the holy ghost without it coming through the son of man see to live up on earth and give his life right are you you following me that way then it would release the life all right so then down in the church ages there's no way from going this well what do you mean brother dale it's just this son of god we believe the holy ghost and it's the holy ghost now glory hallelujah we're here ready to go well why haven't we gone i mean that's just the main thing but you see so he would have to come down to the ages and coming down through those ages as son of god the new birth coming back to the faith of the fathers by way of malachi 4. then see then coming to the point of being the son of man dwelling on earth again just for a little time in the end time amen now we'll get them down in a few minutes and read some what the prophet said but just remember brother adam was not the son of man he was a son of man these son of man is the lord jesus christ all right now see that separates it we'll read that in a minute to you but the point i'm trying to get you to look at is that watch it to the agency then here would come the prophet even before the seals would break anything you know immediately he would start talking about son of man and as as he would bring forth the son of man he's laying in order the scriptures that's right all right to show us what was to be in the end time right all right now because see we didn't know the scripture spoke like that that's right i mean you know i've never read any commentator or anything that spoke of how that he had to come back as son of man to be able to to to bring this thing to an end they might say he would come and son of man if they did they would just say he's going into the millennium from there but we've got to have a rapture and that's got to be related to the son of man right all right so then we're trying to follow the point now look at the next one which is the mighty god unveiled 1964 uh 629. look what he says then we find after his death burial and resurrection he came on the day of pentecost as son of god god the spirit in the form holy spirit what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to the people in a different form like the holy spirit which is god he came to deal through the church ages the son of god the holy spirit but in the millennium he comes the son of david to sit on the throne of david king he was to take the throne of david he's on the father's throne now see the son of god and then he said he that overcomes yourself with me on my throne as i've overcome instead of my father's throne he says it's the same god all the time going down to the next feast of the trumpets 64 7 19 page 14 now he's been revealed through the church ages now watch through the church ages the son of god god be in the spirit the holy spirit he revealed himself in the church ages as in the congregation now he followed him the holy spirit among the people we find in the lady you'll see in church age the last church page he's put out of the church you know he's going to be put out at son of god right because that's what they've turned down as the baptism of the holy ghost oh yeah they got their shouting and their glory hallelujahs and everything but it doesn't matter what you call it that's anointed right he's put out of the church nowhere else was ever put out in any age but in the lady of seeing aids because they said we're rich and have need of nothing he was put out of the church age and then according to luke 17 30 as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man see now bringing it to the basis that you would see him in what he's supposed to be seeing him in the point of what means son of man and as i said get it in your mind then does everybody understand what i'm trying to bring whether you agree with me or not i mean you've got to let god reveal it to you i can't do it right but i want you to understand my terminology because that way that's the only way i know to bring it all right see that he would be son of god because that's who he was born all right he was born son of god he was born lord to christ all right now i know what brother ryan says now what's the what's the thing now he said see our city never called himself son of man i mean son of god said he always called himself son of man then one day he says it like this he said you say now people were probably quoting him back to him but he caught their point he said you say that he never said he was son of god he said oh yes he did that he acquired himself to be the son of god with signs and wonders and things see showing us what that even though we can take quotes we can have 90 quotes of son of man that that he never called himself nothing but son of man and then you got one where he called us the son of god if you don't if that won't come together then you're gonna have to make him wrong in one place but who was he he was born lord to christ which was the son of the living god he came on earth in that way but as he grows up and growing in grace and knowledge and coming out through the word you know and to his ministry he became then under that dispensation the son of man the son of man because he became the word made flesh is what the son of man is dealing with are like prophetic ministry all right and so he's dealing then to show us where you know the things that we're we're to see all right so we must return back i hope you understand what i mean on that he must return back in the end time and i believe he has so don't say i'm looking for somebody to come no no no no no because everybody knows 1969 in athens georgia i preached the message the first one ever preached in this message as a message quote i used to teach sunday school and thing but i preached a message and entitled it son of man and i proved our and i still haven't written in the front of my bible i proved there in athens georgia in 1969 that the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man brother adam is a son of man part of the body of christ so he'll be part of the son of man all right you know do you understand what i'm saying he he was a son of man but yet being part of the body of christ made him part of the son of man to be fulfilled in the last days through the bride of jesus christ so it's a wonderful opportunity or a great thing to see what we're talking about so we read now it's the same god he's just changing his form all right he didn't understand all himself and as i always say to you you say well how are you god doesn't understand we'll explain to me how he don't know my sins in order to solve the problem right because he don't know my sins if i ask him to forgive me now you tell me that he don't know that i done them things is he total amnesia to cut it off no the blood covers it right and he can't see it right and never will be able to see it because it's under the blood he won't drag it out and like i said when brother branham said that one time he said somebody has something under the blood i can't bring it out under the discernment he said because it's under the blood and that was that was great to me now all right see he didn't understand his part and actually he didn't understand fully his part in the coming of of the father's strong because he would have to come now and tell those things that's what he came to to patmos was to tell of his part in the father's throne or the baptism of the holy ghost down through the seven church ages all right that would be what he would be coming for was to show those things all right and to show on all the way into the future of what's going on harley gave you a quote where you could have it revelation chapter 1 1960 1204 when our lord was on earth the disciple would ask him master will you at this time restore the kingdom to back to israel jesus said it's not for you to know this hour or time and no one would know said even the son as yet did not know but after his death burial and resurrection and ascension into glory he receives from god the father i mean from god the future of the church he returned back to brandon's message to the church and this message of his coming in the condition of his church down through the ages he could not do it before his death burial and resurrection because he had not yet knew it he did not notice he did but did you notice the scripture that's the revelation god gave to jesus how that god the father gave the revelation to his son jesus christ and he sent an angel to john to signify these things of which was which is and which is to come all right now i know that i've read these a lot but just remember there's other people listening that have not heard what you've heard so bear with me while i read some or give you some of these things sometimes over and two or three sermons and repeat them because we're trying our best to not pastor the world i'm not caring about that but if there's anybody out there wants to hear you know a sister from india she she listens and she'll be listening in as quick as this goes through what it has to to get to that and she'll be listening in and she writes back comments about things and and you know and how that the lord has blessed her through aaron's message of the day she's mentioning it and all right well praise god you know if anybody wants to hear that's all i'm doing it for i'm not trying to pastor nobody not getting no money out of it's costing me it's not me you know we're not getting nothing back it's costing to send these things well there's a lot of people and some do send money but we've told them over and over don't send no money you know all right but now let's get on with the message see now here's the part i want to get to see then it was revealed to jesus christ and he brought it to john on patmos signifying it or bringing it announcing it by his angel that would come and telling the church ages and the things and not only that would tell him all the way through the future you know about israel about a rapture about israel and and things like that you know and it will go all the way as i said to the future home all right now to me to me i want to use this when we get down to speaking a little bit on predestination because to me that's what it means in revelation 10 7. there's the mystery of god it doesn't say mysteries it says the mystery revelation 10 7 it says the mystery we see it takes all of the mysteries to make that mystery you understand it takes all of the mysteries to make that one mystery all right and see that's why it's saying it that way and what we're talking about of the coming of the son of man to be coming in the end time back to the church is part of that mystery now i won't say it but people ain't going to like it but most of the people of this message i've actually heard very little that's right very little now i've heard some from brother richard and brothers there and all but i'm talking about this very little that i've heard of them talking about why the son of man had to come back they just talk about cinnamon right around with son of man brother and they i've never heard any of them say you know outside of brother richard and him but that that the bride of christ would be the son of man have you now i'm just honest have you heard them out there no we don't hear them out there they don't talk about it because they don't understand all right now i'm not throwing off on it it's not my badness that's between them and god what god reveals to them but see my whole point ever since i said from 69 up until now what do you think about now if i believed in 1969 that the bride of jesus christ would be the word made flesh according to the prophet even be the fullness of the godhead bodily according to the prophet right on unlike uh the unveiling of god mighty god unveiled and all and would be the son of man made manifest for a short period of time upon the earth now there's a reason for that there is a reason for it to be the son of man for a short period of time all right now i made it back there and i you know that's been enough to hold us that it has to come to that before you can go to son of day son of david in the millennium but there's more to go with the story now that's what we need to cover now and i've covered it and and spoke upon it but try to now to get it all together to where we can follow it so follow with us and study on it well brother i don't understand you well how many times have you went back to listen to the tape how many times have you prayed for god to reveal it to you i mean how many times like i said if you went back and re-listened well i didn't get it then i ain't gonna get it again well why don't you do the bible that way just throw it away because you don't need it anyway do you oh brother dale you're too sarcastic well if that's sarcastic then i don't understand what anything else would be it's god's honest truth how many times have you read the bible over over over over over right and every time you read it you get more out of it don't you how many times you listen the prophet's message over over over i told you about it from the unveiling of god where the lord revealed that we listen to that we used to play tape going to work every day and coming back and we listened to that tape four days in a row because nobody didn't take an extra one and we listened to the unveiling of god all right and that meant eight trips you know because you're coming back home all right and i'd sit there with a pencil and turn that recorder because the batteries would run out and i mean there was like 12 of them in there you know so it was hard to buy a bunch but anyhow we'd done it to do but one day it clicked on me son of god son of man son of god son of david that's the only three sons he comes in but you go back and listen to that unveiling of god and keep in there and i gave you the quote there a moment ago where that he comes back see as son of man so it's son of god then he returns back the son of man and then he'll go to son of david because that's where it started son of man son of god son of man son of david see how many times do you need to listen maybe you need to listen to the services over again no now there's a key that we need to understand that i want you to see today all right because to me now the son of man was the voice that raised lazarus amen from the dead right but it was the voice of the son of man and i'm not different i'm just telling it on down the road it's not just the holy spirit right it's the voice through a man which was the holy spirit yes speaking all right but you see the son of man was the voice of the resurrection that's right that's why jesus had the resurrection ministry you remember as jonah was in the belly of the whale three days three nights and then they misunderstood it so you know he said you'll have this see it's the resurrection ministry you're talking about the son of man was the one that could raise the dead amen the son of man could heal right all right the son of man could even forgive sins like connected to the son of man that we nearly need to study a lot but i want you to think about it today for one thing the son of man was the voice of the resurrection all right now that's why brother branham could stand in the end time under the son of man ministry and say bring me 24 of your worst cases and i'll guarantee you healing for every one of them now where's ever been a man could say that well was it five or seven people raised from the dead in the ministry of brother branham me why because he had the son of man ministry are you following me he had the sign of the resurrection because the sign of the resurrection is healing right and the ultimate of healing are raising the dead but then preaching the gospel to bring us to the ultimate of the change of the body all right now that's why i had to come back as son of man in the last days and you'll see what i'm talking about as we go along so right the son of man was the voice of the resurrection that raised lazarus now now i know and i can relate backwards and forth and go with you and so i'm all right but you'll just have to pray i know brother rhino will say the son of god i know the scripture that even says we're brother random quotes that the voice of the son of man in this next one i know the scripture in john 5 25 where it says the son of god you'll hear the son of god and be raised in the last days but just remember the son of god is the son of man it wasn't two gods it was god manifesting himself on the earth see the lord jesus christ was the son of man the sign of the messiah the resurrection amen all right and here comes the prophet in the end time with that same side but he says that's got to be in the bride right well now who you think's going to have this come on i've told you over and over what it is the same ministry of the lord jesus christ i believe is in the earth today but it's around the world it's not in one person it's not to be in one person that was in brother branham the resurrection sign that was in the lord jesus right but that same ministry is supposed to be in the bride around the world all right how do we believe that but look what he says number six on you know paragraph 108 i have heard but now i see 1965 11 27 the evening service but remember the promised word of god by the mouth of jesus christ the very god that spoke creation into existence it was the one before the foundation of the world that spoke the words and let there be now who is that the lord jesus christ i don't want it done that right that and there was he said he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not but as many as did know him to them gave the power get them he gave power to become the sons of god the very creator the very creator himself when he raised up lazarus from the dead listen he said this is not strange for the hours coming that when all that's in the grave will hear the voice of the son of man and shall come out the very god that said let there be said the voice of the son of man would wake those that are in the grave it has to happen in its season he's spoken all right now here's where we stand see we stand on a prophet's message but if you're preaching this to a denominational world they'll immediately jump over and they'll tell you like i said they'll tell you over in matthew 5 25 which is the scripture brother branham is using here to show you that this that they would hear all right now they're listening that they would hear the voice of the son of god now see here's where it's great to have a prophet because he's the son of man now he wouldn't correct in the scripture he'll call it son of god all right but listen if you relate it only to the son of god then i'll tell you up front and i'll be glad to show you where the prophet says that scripture is not talking about in other words now or whatever that's the end of the world amen that's right that's at the end of the world when everybody hears the voice of the son of god you know why because that's the reason i love it see if i can get it correctly now if i miss it forgive me but son of man is ruler of the earth but son of god is ruler of all things amen that's right i believe that i know that quotes that way the son of god is ruler of all times see all right so then what would it be the son of god would be over there to raise everything but the son of man is going to be here that's right to raise the dead in this day and it was proved by the prophet's ministry of five or seven times or which one it is that the dead was raised but that's only speaking of the resurrection right all right that's only speaking of it okay see so we don't remember he was in the office of the son of man while on earth and that office would include the voice of the resurrection which would be able to raise the dead the healing of the sick that would be why he would be there see but the son of god was in the son of man that was the voice of the resurrection the son of god that was in the son of man but he still used the son of man the son of man had to bring the dead forth why would it be would not be that god would just speak out of heaven and did raise it he's got to have a voice all right so follow me all right see then we know the voice of god all right son of god voice of god is the creator god right right and we know all things were created by him john 1 hebrews 1 colossians 1 and ephesians 3 and 9. all things were created by jesus christ so we're not leaving off the son of god and just running over to a son of man that's what people do because they can't follow and keep it all together remember when he was on earth that son of god was standing there in that son of man the son of man was the office that was being made manifest sunshine how does that lighten up what is it supposed to be fatherhood right old testament sonship right then holy ghost dispensation so where was his sonship does that tie with adoption the word made flesh huh see why that you you got so much all right but now watch so then the lord jesus christ while he was on earth here he had the voice of the resurrection okay the son of man had the voice of the resurrection which would have to be the voice of the archangel okay now we'll get on over to the thessalonians where the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel and the trumpet let's tie something together right here that we've been on for a while and i hope you was been listening to it see who is this great one in jude 1 and 9 that says that michael the archangel now listen i know come on just don't worry about it get into it if anybody's listening that thinks there's you know the scripture doesn't call brother uh doesn't call the lord jesus christ the archangel he's called the angel of the covenant all et cetera et cetera but brother branham calls him the voice of the archangel all right so now we depend upon what he's saying that that's telling us what the scripture is really saying right i just say that's great somebody comes along they're listening to you and they say well what about this side the other they said well boy he picked that out for when once i thought of it he said it well maybe i ain't claiming discernment on this claim problem plains common sense because that's what it takes all right so now let's get into something in jude 1 and 9 then because michael the archangel in daniel he's called the chief of princes he's called your prince he's called a great prince michael is in the book of daniel all right now there's only like the the four times it's mentioned and this is michael now the word michael's used in the bible don't misunderstand me there's a lot of kids named michael all right but i'm talking about what the use of what it's doing but now we know for sure what brother random said number seven beginning into the gentile dispensation to 55 109 evening and at that time michael shall stand the great prince michael was christ of course who fought the angelic wars in heaven with the devil all right now we're going down to christ the mystery of god reveal number eight sixty three o seven twenty eight and he says the first thing that lucifer done to separate the fellowship of god and man he wanted to build him a united kingdom of great splendor and seemingly more cultural cultured a greater kingdom than michael christ had now so michael is christ that's why i say satan never did understand that he was standing there thinking he was the number one guy standing beside the lord and out comes a pillar of fire a halo of light or whatever and it goes forth and begins to create all right and that's the fella that he wound up not being able to whip and like i said now even gabriel is a great one that is to deliver the messages but yet he couldn't conquer satan you know right see michael had to come to his rescue so michael cast him out in the beginning and michael will cast him out in the end all right so then we're not saying that jesus now jesus was michael now i didn't say that jesus christ is michael the christ is michael all right now see then in doing that then we've got it lined up correctly that who is the voice of the archangel michael which is christ all right now if we see who christ is then we can understand what's going to take place in the high states all right going pretty slow but so we know that the one that could raise the dead was the son of man right all right the son of man the lord jesus christ okay and that was michael which is christ christ you remember the other week when we had it week ago christ michael is the son of god below god's the theophany the thing right that's christ that's michael he later became flesh and would be known as jesus because that would be the name of god but he's the christ all right now see then watch what i'm talking about see was the voice then michael is the voice of the archangel which is the voice of the son of man all right look at number nine on your notes because here's where we're going to get back to where we are in revelation 4 1. laying all that down to get you to see who the voice is now we read in revelations 4 1 that he heard a voice in heaven that said come up who was that voice it wasn't the angel because you're getting too close the angel is just telling you what takes place voice did john hear revelation chapter 4 part 1 1960 12 31 that same voice said to john come up here i'll show you some things that's fixing to happen that same voice that shall sound when the dead in christ rise now get all of this same voice remember it's not the one god for the trumpet the trumpet what is the trumpet the voice of christ the one who shouted and summoned him up he heard the voice like a trumpet sound and said come up hither see how the resurrection will be i'm reading it it'll be in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that clear astounding voice and he summons the church calling come out of it that great summons and voice all right number 10 revelations chapter 4 part 2 24 elders 61 101 is after that mean that after meant that after the church had you deceased john was summons to come up higher come up higher hither which means come up here he showed him all that was going to happen in the world of the church age then after the church ages was over we find then that john was a type of ever true believer that will be summoned by christ on high that right summon come up hither and we find out that the voice that spoke to him was the voice of a trumpet clear distinctly now what's he and it was the same voice that spoke to him here on earth now that's two things the man that was talking to him while he was going through his ministry but you'll get it in just a minute what he's talking about on earth because he's on earth when he sees revelations 1 10. okay as long as he was in the midst of the seven candlesticks so now is where we are where's he at he was speaking to or from oh i like that speaking from the candlesticks see he was in the candlestick speaking from them to his church then when the church ages seized he left the earth and moved up into the heavens and called his redeemed up with him oh isn't that beautiful it just makes me my heart jump and where'd he hear the voice he heard a voice to call him up into heaven right for one this is the same voice that he heard while he was on earth which is in the church ages part of revelations 1 10 because we prove as we're going down we heard a voice behind him revelations chapter 4 part 3 throne of mercy thrown mercy 61 108. then we find out here after these things he heard a voice was speaking to him what was it the spirit left the earth after these things starts out the first chapter or the first verse after this i looked and behold a door was open in heaven revelation 4 1 after the church is gone then a door was open and we went through all of that and found that that was that that was christ was the door and the same voice that was walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks also was the same voice he heard in heaven saying come up hither john went up it represented church going in the rapture all right number 12. revelation chapter 4 part 1 16 12 31 the same voice that someone john come up the same voice that said to john come up is the same voice that'll summon the church someday amen someone's the church all right now you follow me the voice that calls him up into heaven is the voice that spoke to him on earth now we're going to find out in a minute that that voice would be the same voice as i said a compound which would be the voice that called john and told him to turn around well you don't have the word john there no but i got the word charlie and he said charlie the voice that told you to turn around his voice was called you one day and tell you to come up all right which is charlie cox okay now watch so now what are you dealing with the same voice that someone john come up the same voice that said to john come up he's the same voice that'll summons the church someday amen summons the church so what are you looking for brother dale i'm looking for the same voice that called me to tell me to come up all right now he called me here on earth and john was here on earth remember in revelations one he was still on that part now this all saw the same voice that summoned john to come up it's the same voice that summoned dead lazarus out of the grave that same voice of the archangel christ is the voice of the archangel voice of the archangel oh that trumpet voice of christ summoned john to come up the same voice summoned lazarus did you notice that the graves of lazarus he spoke with a loud voice not just said in other words he imitated it in his weakness not saying that's what lazarus come forth it summoned him from the dead all right it's the loud voice but it's all the same isn't it okay all the same look revelations chapter 4 part 2 uh 24 elders 61 101 that's the same thing that takes place right here the church was taken up into heaven and john now that's john you know and john now is brought up with it as a type of the resurrected so you gotta have the resurrection before the church going to rapture right come on you understand what i'm saying john was taken up it doesn't mention resurrection in the scriptures but it's all got to be the same right and find out the same voices summoning him to look back on earth was the same voice that summoned him to come up and every christian you know all right so you understand every christian that means you write your name there you know write it down there you know all right write dick addison you know right all right and every christian the very voice charlie that summons you one day down there in kentucky to turn around is the same voice that'll summons you come up now what was the voice that told him to turn around his salvation right in other words when it saved jesus one's going to call you up where are you looking for the voice to come from aren't you glad of that brother evans the voice that said turn around same voice said come up oh my there are what are summons what a really what a reality clear distinct like a trumpet turn around serve me come up to where i am did you see how you split that turn around and serve me that's your salvation come up to where i am all right now so there was where he was and it's the same voice that called you because it's the voice of the lord jesus christ and jesus christ is the archangel and michael is the archangel right so can you see that michael is christ it's the way that he's being used or what is being done when once we leave out of here he'll go back to israel right right who's going to israel michael who will that be christ jesus the human flesh doesn't stand and talk to israel in the tribulation he's through two witnesses they meet him in the millennium now revelation chapter 4 part 1 16 12 31 the voice was the same that walked into seven golden candlesticks same voice the voice didn't change but the voice were it was when he heard it the first time and he remembers where's john here at the first time and i talked about the salvation in the first church age behind him i was in the spirit on the lord's day revelations 1 10 in the spirit and went to put that down to revelation 1 10 and 13. i was in the spirit on the lord's day and i heard behind me as a voice of a trumpet sounded like many waters now he's tying many waters because that many waters is not mentioned in revelations 10. now he's coming this many waters maybe it might be in revelation 10 let me look at it i mean revelations 1 10. i better correct myself no he said i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a boy great voice as of a trumpet then later on it called it the voice of the of the people which is a voice of many waters so now brother around tying it all together all right so now watch it he showed him all the mystery of the seven children candlesticks holding the seven stars and the white wig on and so forth to feet like bryson then you heard the same voice watch speaking from heaven and he looked up and he saw an open door oh and open door into heaven how do you get in i crossed that one door one way no other way all right revelation chapter 4 part 1 61 12 31 paragraph 109 that was paragraph 102 right above there now after the church edges were over and everything was come ready made ready the setting of the fourth chapter here the church ages were done he had done left the earth you see remember the voice that spoke to him behind him in the seven golden candlesticks the word was finished and now that same voice was speaking up in heaven what was it he had done redeemed his people his earthly work was finished and he was in glory calling to john come up hither amen that makes me feel like shouts come up here all right now michael christ voice of the archangel same voice as in revelation 1. what do you think we'll get over revelation 10. you know what brother around makes that as plain as can be and people have argued ever since i've been to mexico where he stands with one foot on land and one on the sea and raised his hand and brought around and said that's exactly the same as revelation 1 13. the one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlestick like on the son of man and people's trying to figure out what that is happening over there because you see for a week we can't be over in revelations 10 1. if you're in revelation 10 1 you've missed a rat shot because the rapture is revelation 4 1. and from 4 1 to 19 about 21 or somewhere i i'll give you exactly brother and said that's israel right yes well brother dale revelations 10 i know i've been through that with ministry it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound that's right but just remember this message is what's going to israel but brother branham will go to israel so it's got to have that meaning to it okay let's bring it on over tight together for a minute and quit number 16 on your notes the rapture 1965-1204 in the first thing that is the sounding this is this is first thessalonians right the lord himself shall descend from heaven the shout voice of an archangel and trumpet now this voice of the archangel has got to be the same voice of the archangel that raised lazarus got to be the one that called john or how many archangels have you gotten what are you dealing with but if you see christ and all of that then you can understand voice was shouted then a voice and then a trumpet what shout a messenger getting the people ready the second is a voice of the resurrection what the same voice that a loud voice in saint john 11 38 and 44 that caused lazarus from the grave same voice whose own says getting the bride together because it's the forces of resurrection which is the voice of the message getting the bride together that's why brother around had the resurrection ministry he had to have so the lord himself descends from heaven with a shout voice of an archangel all right now raptured 1965-1204 program 164. therefore the message calls the bride together the shout and the trumpet the same morning with a loud voice he screamed out with that shout in other words jesus screamed out with a shout and and voice and woke lazarus it was jesus's message his voice that's what i was saying there while ago it's not to just say holy spirit it was the voice of the son of man amen the holy spirit using the man to speak but not to just say the holy spirit because that would just put it as a it could speak anywhere but it can't speak anywhere that's why we're going to get to it later on these days and you'll see that soul of god was not back in the old testament made manifest it was there and it was being made partially manifest but nobody in the old testament had it you got adam and eve and then you come on down all right voice that wakes up the sleeping dead amen that's going to be in the end time rapture paragraph 130 65 1204 jesus does all three of them when he he's descended a shout what is a shout is a message going forth first the living bread of the living of the life bringing forth god has a way of doing things he never changes his policy so what it's going to be in the end time there would have to be a message brought by the son of man not brought around him now the son of man amen using a son of man to bring his word using the very lips and everything because you've got to have the lips you've got to have the connection to the son of man see that's the point i'm trying to get in a hurry all right now the next one is a repeat which is number 12 and just get the point john summoned him to come up he said the same voice that summoned john is the same voice that someone did lazarus out of the grave the same voice of the archangel christ is the voice of the archangel voice of the archangel and that trumpet voice of christ summoned john to come up so it will also do the same thing in the end time okay now you know the next one down there 340 of the church age book where under her messenger the bride will be the final voice amen to the final age because she's going to be the son of man she will be decent a man right she won't be a son of man right now we're going to get on something this evening to really open that up i hope she's going to beat this on a man that's why mary was not the seed she was a carrier mary represented associate street pentecost but it's got to be the same all right now follow me just a second so then what are we looking at the son of man was the voice of the resurrection call the dead out of the ground release the life of god to be able to come back upon the church in the baptism of the holy ghost to be the son of god to live through the seven church ages right in the end of the seventh church age you would begin to see him appearing as in speaking of the son of man and the son of the son of man would be coming back into view through brother brown which was the sign of the lord jesus christ he had the same ministry the lord jesus christ had right raised the dead healed the sick cast out devil now it wasn't brother branham right come on it was god fulfilling his word because he said in the in the days when the son of man would be revealed we'll get on some more this evening on that not these not the no the angels not the son of man brother and said it anointed one's the end time he said the son of man is god in other words jesus christ but you see it's happened down through the ages to bring it back to work that the resurrection can come and the resurrection can come in the end time and it'll be the bride that would be calling for it because what is it hebrews 4 hebrews 11 40 they without us cannot be made perfect so everybody even brother branham is sitting waiting on us waiting on the bride to become the word made flesh we got a great job ahead of us and the bride will have then the ministry of jesus christ which she will be christ made manifest in the last quote i gave you the scripture speaks of the on the groom speaks of the bride so all right so in the end time it will be the son of man the lord jesus christ making himself manifest upon earth through the bride that the prophet has brought the message to us and without him bringing the message to us we would not be able to understand that simple but he's part of the body of christ so he'll be part of that where the prophet said that the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily and raise the dead that there'll be a voice come forth then we'll raise the dead and we'll go into rapture the voice of the archangel the lord himself shall descend from endless shout message right voice of the archangel the word the son of man in the bride he said well how in the world can we ever become that because god promised it that's the only way you want me to give you about a 50-something quote where brother branham i have these my brother ryan says you are the word made flesh that's it we see everybody think oh no no we're not are you born again if you're born again you're a child of god you have eternal life right but the growth development brings you up through the stature of a perfect man bringing it out to adoption where he can pour in his fullness and raise the dead and we'll go into rapture it's all in me and you because it's michael christ who's fighting for israel michael well who's going to fight for the bride well now it's michael over there but it's christ over here see how many gods you got what are you talking about i'm talking about the same god made manifest in many different forms that once he was brought jehovah in the old testament fatherhood then he came into the sonship and under that sonship he was the son of god born the son of god he became the son of man which he became the word made flesh he grown grace and knowledge into the position he was the word made flesh he was the word 13 years old or something correct in those people but then he became the word and his fullness made flesh why because he didn't know everything if he did why did it say he learned or grew in grace and knowledge but you see the bride of jesus christ is going to be the voice of the resurrection let me quote that correctly vern you know because that's where the arguable way the man did it says on that quote 340 of the church age book under her messenger she will be the final voice to the final age well that's what the quote says but see people think it's oh you you're trying to make it well the brother branham is part of the body of christ amen i'm trying to make him what he is amen he was the one god used but he was part of the body of christ he's not outside the body is he of course that's what they're saying now all about this is christmas trees and things like that that brother random could have a christmas tree because he was in another age we we can't have one because we're over here in a different age now you got your messenger in one age and you and another one that's about as much garbage as i know and i'm sorry but that's just about as much garbage as i could recognize anywhere how can you have your messenger in another age but you know this messenger is waiting on you and i right god is waiting on you and i as jesus growed in grace and knowledge i thought that's what we talked about the statue of perfect man with us growing in grace and knowledge out to adoption let's stand together come on do you understand i know i put so much in sometimes until it's just it's hard but we've been over this and over this and over this maybe some out there that haven't heard call us we'll be glad to send you the copies of all of the series and everything that we can can get to you but we've been over this for 40 something years now folks that we've been talking about because 1969 that's not exalted statement it's a god's honest truth i preached it to the bride of jesus christ would be the son of man in the last days why because that's what i believe the prophet you see everybody else is just saying then well brother adam's running around and brought around this on a man he wasn't the son of man he couldn't be these son of man is the lord jesus christ what i told him baptist when he was back there they said we're baptist at coffin john i said well there ain't but one because it says did john the baptist so that means it's one so there's never but one of them i said look what you've missed yeah go ahead i know that's this carnage life she needs you to touch her you've been having problems with her stomach we just commit everything into your hands lord and we believe that by your stripes the one that we've been talking about this morning the great eternal i am the lord jesus christ is hearing to make manifest that resurrection sign of healing the sick and casting out devils and all of the things that you've done while he was here and you're back here again in full manifestation in the blood of jesus christ and we believe it in jesus name anybody can anybody else have a knee is is is but don't let your dependency is in the name of our all right is anybody else is our brother is asking one thing that i think we all should ask a closer walk with god to rededicate our lives and our hearts to god and want a closer wall for our so let's all pray together father we ask you lord jesus that you would just make manifest what our brother is asking for he wants lord a closer walk with you so do we all father we all realize that we're flawful in all things but yet lord we know that you're not we ask you now that you just come on the scene and just bless in jesus name anybody else disbelief is what we said lord would be taken and considered by the people we ask that you would just come on the scene and quicken it unto us that we may see the hour and the time that we're living and lord to deceive it for all of these years we've been talking about you and your way we ask you now to just come and reveal yourself because we can't do that but we commit it all to you now forgive our sins lead us by thy grace and your love in jesus name amen you're dismissed remember the service is two o'clock the name of jesus with you take the name of jesus with righteousness our christ is me
