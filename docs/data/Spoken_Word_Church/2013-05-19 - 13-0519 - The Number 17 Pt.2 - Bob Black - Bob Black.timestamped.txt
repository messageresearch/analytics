[0:22] let's turn to First Kings chapter 17.
[0:30] all that
[0:32] is it going for you
[0:37] mama where is that little fan
[0:41] oh right over there
[0:44] it's all right you know what no no we're
[0:47] fine we can do away with it right now
[0:53] okay all right all right all right
[0:56] all right I'm going to continue on
[0:59] from last Sunday
[1:01] I'll just carry on the same tops off so
[1:07] um we're talking about the number 17 I'm
[1:09] just kind of running through some of the
[1:10] things that people are saying around the
[1:12] message about brother Brown and and
[1:15] showing in the Bible where
[1:17] um
[1:18] you know the things that he said were
[1:20] true so I just kind of wanted to keep
[1:22] going on that thought
[1:32] I split the switch that's why testing
[1:36] it takes a second there you go all right
[1:39] you're on now okay
[1:43] so First Kings chapter 17.
[1:46] I remember what we were talking about
[1:48] now that um all through this this book
[1:50] First Kings uh you know it goes through
[1:53] the story of seven Kings the story of
[1:55] Solomon and David and all these
[1:57] different stories and then boom all of a
[1:58] sudden Elijah comes on the scene Elijah
[2:01] chapter seven and First Kings chapter 17
[2:03] and the first thing he does
[2:05] one of the larger the test bite who was
[2:08] of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto
[2:10] Ahab as the Lord God of Israel living
[2:13] the born in my stand
[2:15] this shall not be dude or rain these
[2:17] years but according to my word uh it
[2:20] seems like that this is one of the
[2:22] biggest complaints about brother Brown
[2:23] is why was he so harsh why did he say
[2:26] um
[2:27] why did he say harsh things about about
[2:29] the sisters the women and
[2:32] um why did he say uh that you know your
[2:34] your dog may comparing people to uh
[2:36] Jezebel now now remember the story of
[2:39] Jezebel when Yahoo came riding in on his
[2:41] Chariot Jezebel looked at him out of the
[2:43] window and started fixing her her face
[2:45] up to look real pretty and Yahoo being a
[2:49] you know servant of God he was inspired
[2:51] by the Lord he looked at that and said I
[2:53] ain't falling for that and if even
[2:55] without the Holy Ghost he looked upon
[2:57] that and and it's like that that's not
[3:00] right and
[3:02] my if uh you know if we could kind of
[3:06] keep to the same standards that they did
[3:08] even back then without the Holy Ghost
[3:10] and uh he he looked upon that with with
[3:12] wisdom and and they that you remember
[3:14] the the uh the concubines or whatever
[3:18] that were wither through throughout the
[3:20] window and the dogs ate her up now
[3:23] brother Brown was comparing these
[3:25] worldly women with that because if you
[3:26] if you look down two tracks you've got
[3:29] everybody has a choice to make you you
[3:30] can
[3:32] go the the way of God or take the way of
[3:37] your own thoughts your own make your own
[3:39] denomination and go a separate way let
[3:43] you continue down that track then it
[3:44] goes to away what brother Brown said
[3:46] you're nothing but a cannon fodder
[3:48] because you're just waiting for the fire
[3:49] to fall and consume you up and there
[3:51] there won't be uh any um you won't have
[3:54] any part with eternal life because uh
[3:57] you chose the way of your own ideas and
[3:59] things and um so that
[4:02] what brother Brandon when he when he was
[4:04] preaching truth but many people just
[4:07] have a problem with truth and uh
[4:10] you know brother random talked about how
[4:12] there's a big difference between love
[4:14] and sympathy if you sympathize right
[4:16] with Jezebel that's a whole lot
[4:18] different than you know today this is
[4:21] the age of sympathy where people are you
[4:23] know you know at my work you know if you
[4:26] don't sympathize with the homosexuals
[4:27] and different things and you're not
[4:28] you're out but um real love will will
[4:32] bring it right on down the line right so
[4:34] let's um so what he says there shall not
[4:37] be do nor Reign these years but
[4:38] according to my word
[4:41] now everybody looks at brother random
[4:42] says he said so let's turn over to First
[4:46] Kings chapter 18.
[4:48] whose word was it and it came to pass
[4:52] after many days that the word of the
[4:54] Lord came to Elijah in the third year
[4:56] saying go show thyself unto Ahab and I
[5:00] will send rain upon the Earth
[5:03] my brother Brandon will just we read
[5:05] that quote and looking to the Unseen
[5:07] where God actually because he was able
[5:09] to yield himself completely to God then
[5:12] God was able to use his lips to speak
[5:15] through him
[5:16] and I was reading in the um
[5:18] uh the little the little book that
[5:21] sister Rebecca had put out with the
[5:23] testimonies about that is the one of the
[5:24] sisters was talking about how she had
[5:26] asked brother random does your voice
[5:27] change when God begins to use you when
[5:29] he's speaking through his lips and he
[5:31] said yeah you'll notice it does change a
[5:33] little bit but you know to be honest I I
[5:36] really a lot of times can't tell you you
[5:38] can't uh he you know once you listen to
[5:42] The Seven Seals he said those were the
[5:43] most inspired sermons that I ever
[5:45] preached but it sounds a lot like you
[5:48] know just brothers speaking but it was
[5:51] God behind things working and it wasn't
[5:53] just a man but we know that it wasn't
[5:55] just a man's message because everything
[5:57] was so perfectly put together amen now
[6:00] that's many people say well he he
[6:03] plagiarized things off of Clarence
[6:05] Larkin and all these others but because
[6:07] it fits so perfectly together we know
[6:09] that it was a Vindicated message now how
[6:14] you think well if I could just explain
[6:17] it just the right way for my kids then
[6:20] they would see it if I could just
[6:21] explain it it's just the most perfect
[6:23] way then they would see it let's see how
[6:26] Elisha saw it let's turn over to First
[6:29] Kings chapter 19.
[6:31] and look at
[6:33] it now I think this is another example
[6:35] how it shows that it wasn't a man
[6:37] because after Elijah had the spirit of
[6:40] the Lord was on him and he slew all of
[6:42] the the prophets of Baal then they um
[6:45] you know Jezebel turned against him and
[6:47] she was gonna she uh he ran Afraid from
[6:50] her because the spirit of the Lord left
[6:52] him and that proves that he ran to that
[6:54] cave and that proves that it wasn't if
[6:56] it was him
[6:57] he would have carried on you know but it
[7:00] was the spirit of the Lord was what was
[7:03] behind working the whole thing out and
[7:07] um so Elijah ran to his cave now our
[7:10] Elijah also had a little cave he ran too
[7:12] when when thing you know he talked about
[7:15] um
[7:16] when that that Showdown came you know we
[7:19] were looking at that how he had he said
[7:20] he had 17 left and he ran off to his
[7:23] cave to have a showdown on God and he
[7:25] ran off to that cave the time that um
[7:28] that uh he you know
[7:31] the Bible right Moses wrote all the
[7:34] little problems and things that's
[7:36] another thing that's just so amazing
[7:37] about the Bible Moses didn't write just
[7:40] the good things he wrote all the little
[7:41] bad things too and Elijah brother our
[7:45] Elijah
[7:46] told what kind of ministry we'll get up
[7:49] behind the pulpit and tell all the bad
[7:50] things in his life all the mistakes
[7:52] that's a hard thing to do to get up in
[7:54] front of people and say well I told a
[7:57] lie or I did did this so brother was
[8:00] telling a story about how uh somebody
[8:02] called him on the phone
[8:03] and he said the IRS agent he told his
[8:06] wife tell him I'm not here and uh you
[8:10] know just amazing that he would tell
[8:11] that story but but after that after he
[8:13] felt so convicted he ran off to that
[8:15] cave where God met him he said he stood
[8:18] out on that rock in front of that cave
[8:19] and just raised his hands to the Lord
[8:20] after God had forgiven him and he met
[8:22] him and had fellowship with him and just
[8:24] praising the Lord but let's look at what
[8:26] um
[8:27] Elijah
[8:29] uh let's see
[8:31] let's start
[8:33] um verse 11 let's start at verse 12 of
[8:36] chapter 19.
[8:38] and after the earthquake of fire all the
[8:40] different things came to before Elijah
[8:42] but the Lord was not in the fire and
[8:43] after the fire still small voice and it
[8:46] was Sue and Elijah heard it that he
[8:48] wrapped his face in his mantle and went
[8:49] out and stood in the inner end of the
[8:51] cave and behold there came a voice in
[8:53] them and said what do us down here
[8:55] Elijah now this is the this is the you
[8:59] look at all the different traits of
[9:00] Elijah
[9:01] uh you know he was a Wilderness man he
[9:04] he went the hard line with a hard line
[9:08] against women and different things but
[9:10] now what could you say was the main
[9:12] trait about Elijah and I think this
[9:14] trait applies to the people that follow
[9:16] Eliza too and God was asking him what
[9:18] are you doing here I think maybe we
[9:19] could ask the same question to us what
[9:21] are you doing here what what is your
[9:24] purpose are you just like sitting in
[9:26] church just filling a seat what are you
[9:29] doing here and he said
[9:31] this is so good I I've been very jealous
[9:36] for the Lord God of hooks
[9:39] and their brother uh last night was
[9:43] talking about being jealous jealous for
[9:45] God and and wanting to have a closer
[9:48] relationship with God now this is this
[9:50] is this I believe this is the attribute
[9:53] of the Elijah Ministry I have been
[9:55] jealous for the Lord God of hosts
[9:57] because the children of Israel have
[9:58] forsaken I couldn't not thrown down that
[10:00] altars and slain our prophets with the
[10:02] sword and I even I only am left
[10:05] and they seek my life to take it away
[10:08] now now pay attention because this is I
[10:11] believe this is how
[10:12] that if you you can't lay it down for
[10:15] your kids so that they can see it it's
[10:17] just perfect you can't uh do that but if
[10:20] because of Elijah's jealousy for the
[10:23] Lord because of the life he lived when
[10:27] Elisha saw that he said there's
[10:29] something there's something here that I
[10:31] want
[10:37] and the Lord said unto him
[10:39] go return on our way to the Wilderness
[10:42] of Damascus
[10:44] and when thou cometh anoint how does
[10:46] they ought to be king over Syria
[10:50] and yay who the son of them she shall
[10:52] thou anoint to be king over Israel and
[10:54] Elijah the son of shift
[10:56] thou anoint to be profit in thy room and
[10:59] it shall come to pass and him that has
[11:00] scared the sword and so on and he tells
[11:02] them about the seven thousand that are
[11:04] that are left that have about the knee
[11:06] so verse 19 will come down to Elijah so
[11:08] he departed fence and found Elijah the
[11:10] son of shafat who was plowing with 12
[11:12] yoke of oxen before him and he was the
[11:15] 12th and Elisha passed by him
[11:18] and he told him all about all the
[11:22] different doctrines that he believed in
[11:23] he laid it all down and sat down on the
[11:27] table and pulled his put everything out
[11:28] and explained everything real careful no
[11:31] he cast his mantle upon him and that
[11:34] Spirit he Elijah God in that Spirit when
[11:36] he when he got in that spirit and saw
[11:38] the kind of that God was with Elijah
[11:43] then something got a hold of him and
[11:45] later on you know you read about Elisha
[11:47] saying I I I there ain't no way I'm
[11:49] going to leave you when he got when they
[11:50] crossed over the river Jordan there's
[11:52] there's no way I I see God I've seen you
[11:55] you know you call fire down from heaven
[11:57] but I've seen all these things now look
[11:59] at the light the Elijah of our day well
[12:01] he's given us these three big Witnesses
[12:03] the picture of the cooler fire the
[12:05] picture of the the train that fills the
[12:08] temple that picture you can actually see
[12:09] the angel of the Lord is cloudy picture
[12:12] and then the picture of the cloud coming
[12:14] down the Southern Man coming down to
[12:17] reveal the Seven Seals to us
[12:19] when he left the auction and ran after
[12:21] Elijah and said let me I pray he'd kiss
[12:23] my father and my mother and then I will
[12:25] follow thee and he said unto him go back
[12:27] again
[12:28] for what have I done to the
[12:31] now that's a curious little saying I
[12:33] believe what he's saying there is I'm
[12:35] not calling you I'm not the one that's
[12:37] calling you you think that uh
[12:40] you think that God has put you in this
[12:42] position or you think that I have I'm
[12:44] I'm the one that's calling you to serve
[12:46] God but it's god in me he's calling me
[12:48] go ahead on back and he returned back
[12:51] from him and took the Yoke of oxen and
[12:53] slew them and boiled their flesh with
[12:54] the instruments of The Oxen and gave
[12:56] unto the people and they did eat then he
[12:59] arose and went after Elijah and
[13:01] ministered unto him
[13:03] now that's that's what I believe that as
[13:05] we go through these things is not to I
[13:07] believe what really catches people for
[13:09] teaching is is a consecrated life I
[13:12] believe that's it
[13:14] let me just talk about for a second
[13:16] about growing up in in my family you
[13:18] know when when we would get sick my dad
[13:20] would uh and not to glorify anybody or
[13:22] anything I'm just telling a story look
[13:24] my dad would he would throw himself over
[13:26] my bed while I was sick all night long
[13:30] he'd pray all night long you know many
[13:31] people are prayer warriors but
[13:33] um I believe we should all have a prayer
[13:35] life because that's what really
[13:37] communion is is is is communing with God
[13:40] and you know one night my dad was in
[13:43] prayer and the dog started barking next
[13:45] door and there was the pillar of fire at
[13:47] the window now when you're a kid you
[13:49] just remember things like that there God
[13:51] is real God is he's there's a real God
[13:56] things like that begin to happen to your
[13:58] family one day my wife she ran out of
[14:00] gas and pulled over on the side of the
[14:02] road
[14:05] excuse me
[14:08] and the gas tank was only empty what are
[14:11] we going to do that began to meditate on
[14:14] the Lord and and all the players in the
[14:17] car washed as the gas tank went back to
[14:19] uh half empty it didn't go all the way
[14:20] back before but it went enough right to
[14:23] where she could drive
[14:25] and I have just so many different
[14:27] stories where people can see your
[14:30] children can see God in your life that's
[14:32] right it's not just you telling them uh
[14:34] well let me explain this to you but it's
[14:36] the power of God in your life right you
[14:39] know in in the Old Testament
[14:41] get off my top a little talk a little
[14:43] bit but in the Old Testament they they
[14:45] put those The 10 Commandments in the Ark
[14:50] of the Covenant and really all around
[14:52] their history they wanted to see those
[14:53] Ten Commandments be brought to life
[14:55] that's right and one day Jesus came on
[14:57] the scene that's what that's what
[14:59] everybody wants to see is and to be
[15:01] brought to life not just explain what
[15:03] the first team what what is the first
[15:05] commandment but let me see it live that
[15:07] there's one God right so now
[15:09] oh just talking about criticism you know
[15:13] criticism is supposed to come when we
[15:15] went through the Beatitudes about how
[15:18] the persecuted are blessed and think
[15:20] about all the people in the through
[15:22] through scripture that like Mary think
[15:24] about the persecution and the criticism
[15:26] she had to endure or everybody thought
[15:29] she was a harlot and I thought it was
[15:31] first woman
[15:31] but she was carrying the word of God
[15:33] inside of her right and then uh the
[15:37] woman at the well who what she heard
[15:39] what she had received that whale that
[15:41] Wellspring of everlasting live I heard
[15:43] about it then she didn't care what
[15:45] anybody thought she went running into
[15:46] the City and and and that day it was
[15:49] totally against their Customs or
[15:51] anything to listen to somebody like that
[15:52] but they they uh something would prick
[15:56] their horse because she had she had met
[15:58] the one that could bring the word to
[16:01] life not just to explain it right
[16:05] now brother Brandon when he we talked
[16:07] about when he went overseas to look at
[16:09] the um to uh in India and I think it was
[16:12] Bombay he came before the 17 different
[16:16] religions
[16:17] and this is what he said uh
[16:21] this might be a little different quote
[16:22] but he he just had the same line of
[16:25] thought he's saying I'm not trying to
[16:27] get you to change your thought because
[16:30] that's what uh you know Baptist people
[16:32] from Baptist to methodists to
[16:34] Presbyterian from one Church to another
[16:36] just changing their thought baptized
[16:38] front was baptized backwards baptized
[16:40] this way do it do all the different
[16:42] ordinances in different ways but it's
[16:44] not about a change of thought it's not
[16:46] about if you can explain it in just a
[16:48] particular way but it's about a life or
[16:50] is it right to life
[16:53] and we went through the number 17 real
[16:55] quick and just looked at all the the 17
[16:57] is the seventh prime number the prime
[17:00] number is a number that can't be divided
[17:01] it's only available by 1 and 17. and
[17:04] it's it's a special number because
[17:05] whenever you see something being
[17:07] Vindicated many times in scripture like
[17:09] Esther is the 17th book of the Bible
[17:11] because a Vindicated bride is presented
[17:14] and uh it's God proving his word
[17:18] and all these scriptures about the
[17:21] Rapture about the baptism of the Holy
[17:23] Ghost
[17:24] associated with the number 17 about
[17:26] Elijah coming
[17:29] first Thessalonians 4 17 we would
[17:32] Survivor remain should be caught up
[17:33] together within the clouds of Elijah
[17:36] truly first come Ephesians 1 17 that the
[17:39] god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father
[17:40] of Glory may give unto you the spirit of
[17:42] wisdom and Revelation Revelation and
[17:45] knowledge is the evidence of the Holy
[17:47] Ghost where God reveals things to you
[17:49] and shows teaches you his word he brings
[17:51] it up to you
[17:53] and and then we went through the message
[17:55] baptizing the 17th person on the Ohio
[17:57] River how here he him was recorded 17
[17:59] times and his text was Matthew 17 and
[18:02] the 17 different religions and and so
[18:04] forth and then by other fruits he shall
[18:06] know them brother Brown talked about how
[18:08] you're known your fruits are your
[18:09] Doctrine is it because you can explain
[18:12] it well is that what he meant no because
[18:14] you know you know Paul said you're
[18:17] fruits the fruits of the spirit of love
[18:19] joy peace love love
[18:22] bringing forth that Doctrine and making
[18:25] it that doctrine of uh if you love the
[18:27] things of the world the love of God's
[18:29] not even in you
[18:31] you can say that but now bring it to
[18:33] life bring the life of joy and peace let
[18:36] the peace of God that passeth all
[18:38] understanding be inside of you and I I
[18:41] believe that's what he he meant by fruit
[18:43] not just being able to sit down on the
[18:45] table and Bash somebody over the head
[18:47] with how much you know but to bring
[18:49] forth the doctrine that you have and let
[18:51] the Holy Spirit Quicken after you that's
[18:53] why Jesus told Nicodemus except you'd be
[18:55] born of the of water and spirit of the
[18:59] water the washing of the word and spirit
[19:01] the word must be quickened and made
[19:03] alive in you so that you can live it
[19:07] and then you know if it wasn't for
[19:09] brother Brandon we can look at things in
[19:11] this in the scripture and look at this
[19:13] like this cloud and not understand how
[19:15] to look at it but he showed us how to
[19:17] look at it the right way right
[19:20] now now let's start going through some
[19:22] of these questions why wasn't the cloud
[19:25] publicly announced before May
[19:28] and I I actually got a question in my
[19:30] email somebody asked
[19:31] well is there any any other scripture in
[19:34] the Bible where something happened and
[19:36] then it wasn't announced it was Kept
[19:38] Secret
[19:39] all right so let's look at Luke 2 19.
[19:42] this is when the Shepherds came the
[19:45] shepherds in the field and they and the
[19:46] uh the Angels appeared to them and then
[19:49] they went to the little baby Jesus and
[19:51] Mary and Joseph imagine all this they're
[19:53] they're in their little home and they're
[19:55] in the cave or wherever Jesus was born
[19:58] and all of a sudden the Shepherds show
[20:00] up think about how surprising that would
[20:02] be but Mary kept these things she didn't
[20:05] go running around reclaiming it she kept
[20:09] all these things and pondered them in
[20:11] her heart now think about the number 17.
[20:13] think about how brother Randall said
[20:16] not about the Rapture now it's been
[20:18] spoken now let it come to pass
[20:21] because the number 17 signifies
[20:23] Vindication it's been spoken okay that's
[20:25] great but what about me can I bring that
[20:28] to pass can God bring it to pass in my
[20:30] life right now when he brings it to pass
[20:33] that's what number 17 is all about I
[20:35] believe so Mary kept all these things in
[20:37] her heart okay now they're saying that
[20:40] this is the Messiah an angel spoke to me
[20:43] I believe it now let's just sit back and
[20:47] watch and if if this is true I don't
[20:49] believe she was really doubting or
[20:51] anything I'm just saying let's let's
[20:52] wait and watch for the Manifest
[20:55] manifestation of the word of God to be
[20:57] fulfilled and when he became of age the
[21:00] the spirit Came Upon him by the River
[21:03] Jordan and he began to enter into his
[21:04] ministry and there's the Vindication
[21:06] Luke 251
[21:09] because you remember brother Brandon
[21:11] said God proves his word by bringing in
[21:13] the past look 251 and he went down with
[21:16] him and came to Nazareth and this is
[21:18] when Jesus was teaching in the temple
[21:20] and he went down with him and came to
[21:22] Nazareth and was and was subject under
[21:24] them but his mother kept all these
[21:27] things in her heart remember the story
[21:28] about how they a little Jesus when he
[21:31] was uh I believe it was nine years old
[21:32] twelve thank you and uh
[21:36] so they they forgotten down there and
[21:38] they returned back to to go find him he
[21:40] said don't you know I must be about my
[21:42] father's business dude correction is a
[21:44] Mary and um you know just proving
[21:48] exactly who he was but she didn't go
[21:49] running around to all the neighbors
[21:51] saying I've got a special child right
[21:53] she kept it in her heart but now the the
[21:56] real proof let's turn to Mark chapter 9.
[22:10] chapter nine
[22:13] foreign
[22:47] and there was a cloud that overstanded
[22:49] them and a voice came out of the cloud
[22:51] saying
[22:53] oh
[22:55] well we can just we can get off yeah off
[22:58] the video and there was a cloud that
[23:00] overshadowed them and a voice came out
[23:02] of the cloud saying this is my beloved
[23:03] Son here hear him
[23:05] and suddenly when they looked round
[23:07] about they saw no man anymore said Jesus
[23:09] only with themselves and as they came
[23:11] down from the mountain he charged them
[23:13] that they should tell no man what things
[23:15] they had seen till the son of man were
[23:16] risen from the dead and they kept that
[23:19] saying with themselves questioning one
[23:22] with another what the rising from the
[23:24] dead should mean
[23:26] so they kept that saying let's hold on
[23:28] to that until until everything comes to
[23:30] pass Till It's Made manifest and that's
[23:33] exactly what brother Brown did you say
[23:34] why did he wait till the uh it was
[23:37] published in May 7 on May 17th and uh
[23:41] you know I believe that the focus was
[23:43] not so much on the cloud but on the
[23:46] message that he brought he brought the
[23:49] Seven Seals that was the whole Focus
[23:51] right and then the cloud published in
[23:53] Life Magazine just communicated what are
[23:56] you bringing
[23:58] um and then we looked at
[24:00] some of the different things people are
[24:01] saying you know this is all that
[24:03] clearance block had to say about the
[24:04] first single night I just think that's
[24:05] amazing that you can fit everything and
[24:07] say on on one slack now and people say
[24:10] go around and got it from you know this
[24:12] is the second season the seventh seal
[24:14] that's everything he had to say about
[24:16] the seventh seal and I'm not throwing
[24:17] off at all about brother uh Clarence
[24:19] Larkin
[24:20] uh just I've thrown off on people that
[24:24] say you know
[24:27] it just don't make any sense
[24:29] and so here's another objection
[24:32] I'm just kind of going through these
[24:34] just to just so you know if somebody
[24:36] wants to say something you kind of know
[24:38] what was going on
[24:40] part of William Brown's this is what
[24:42] they say Carl Williams 1933 prophecy was
[24:44] that FDR would pick on the Germans lead
[24:46] the world of war and won it for four
[24:47] terms
[24:49] while Roosevelt was inaugurated four
[24:51] times now this brother Brandon
[24:52] prophesied that Roosevelt will be
[24:53] inaugurated for four times four turns
[24:56] and he's the only president that ever
[24:58] was so they agree with that he did not
[25:00] pick on the Germans and follow the world
[25:03] to war after provocation by the Japanese
[25:06] so they're saying that brother random
[25:07] had a personal agreements with uh
[25:09] Franklin Roosevelt and called him a rat
[25:11] because he called him a rascal in 1960.
[25:14] well you know Jesus called here a fox
[25:16] right that don't mean he had a personal
[25:18] group that's right which indicates that
[25:19] he just did not like him
[25:21] so let's see that so what they're saying
[25:23] is that Roosevelt
[25:25] picked on the Japanese actually and just
[25:27] kind of follow everybody else in the war
[25:28] and this is a highly continuous thing in
[25:32] his for his stories because they many
[25:34] people still today don't believe that
[25:36] Roosevelt orchestrated the the war
[25:38] behind the scenes but that's exactly
[25:40] what he did he was trying he was trying
[25:42] to get Germany to go to war with her and
[25:45] then uh when he couldn't get Germany to
[25:46] go to war he switched over to pick it on
[25:48] Japan and uh so let's uh
[25:51] here's another thing to say clearly
[25:54] Roosevelt did not leave the world in the
[25:56] war and we do not quote pick on them as
[25:58] Reverend Brandon claim
[26:01] so here's the vision that bro Brandon
[26:03] had Journey never Germany never picked
[26:05] on us we picked on them through the
[26:06] whole world into a war to call it World
[26:08] War the Germans built the Maginot Line
[26:10] wish there any veteran who knows where
[26:12] she took their imagined offline
[26:14] and this Mr Roosevelt will cause the
[26:16] world to go into a world home service in
[26:18] time of his administration
[26:20] prison
[26:21] I saw President Roosevelt was going to
[26:23] help lead the world to a World War a war
[26:25] told her that morning they was going to
[26:27] lock me up for it and I said they'll go
[26:28] to war with Germany
[26:30] allowance Bill I said there in that same
[26:33] vision I saw Germany fortified in
[26:34] concrete now that's that's really what
[26:37] he said fortified in concrete and
[26:39] America took a terrible beating there
[26:41] many of you boys know what happened was
[26:43] there
[26:44] and then and then he had a vision in the
[26:47] church age book he talks about he had a
[26:48] vision of Adolf Hitler how he would rise
[26:51] up as a dictator of a Germany and they
[26:53] could draw the world into war so they
[26:55] use that as saying well here he says
[26:57] that Hitler would draw the world into
[26:59] war but you know if you look at
[27:01] historical events it's really
[27:04] it just all ties together so here's a
[27:06] little timeline
[27:07] in 1932 Hitler and Roosevelt were both
[27:10] elected at the same time 1933 Hitler and
[27:13] Roosevelt were both installing the
[27:15] office and around June of 1933 brother
[27:18] Brandon received those seven divisions
[27:20] and in 1934 president Hindenburg of
[27:22] Germany dies and Hitler declares himself
[27:24] to fear and then in 1935 Congress passes
[27:27] the Neutrality Act and says we're not
[27:29] going to mess with anybody everybody
[27:30] that's the public stance we're not going
[27:32] to mess with anybody but behind the
[27:35] scenes uh uh Roosevelt began to to move
[27:39] things to try to get Germany to attack
[27:42] uh in 1938 this is after 1938 but they
[27:47] they released um documents later they
[27:50] showed that behind the scenes Roosevelt
[27:52] was demanding that European countries
[27:53] reject Germany's diplomatic offers and
[27:56] he was promising this Portland
[27:57] militarily if they did so and in 1940 we
[28:00] traded some American destroyers to the
[28:02] British and sent millions of tons of
[28:04] supplies to Russia
[28:07] in 1941 Lynn lisak
[28:10] made us a secretly made us an unlimited
[28:13] War partner where we would just we would
[28:15] behind the scenes provide all these
[28:16] supplies to the to the Allies sure and
[28:19] then in 1941 we're supposed to still be
[28:21] part of that Neutrality Act but we're
[28:23] supplying American troops to Iceland and
[28:26] then
[28:26] the Atlantic Conference of Roosevelt New
[28:28] Jersey Churchill in 1941. the Roosevelt
[28:31] and Churchill began to move move uh Ally
[28:33] closely together and uh
[28:36] wheel and deal behind the scenes we'll
[28:38] help you and you'll help us that kind of
[28:40] thing uh they're still supposed to be
[28:42] neutral in 1941 American submarines were
[28:45] ordered to shoot Germany German warships
[28:47] on site that sounds like picking on
[28:49] Germany July 1941. we're imposing the
[28:54] oil embargo on Japan because we couldn't
[28:56] get Germany to attack us
[28:58] and then uh that's you know then Pearl
[29:01] all right and emergency store in JFC
[29:04] Fuller said about President Roosevelt
[29:05] he'll have no stone unturned to provoke
[29:07] Hitler to declare war on the very people
[29:09] on whom he so ardently promised peace he
[29:12] provided Great Britain with American
[29:14] destroyers he landed American Producers
[29:16] in Iceland and he set out to patrol the
[29:17] Atlantic seaways in order to safeguard
[29:19] British convoys all of which were
[29:21] actually more and so on then Admiral H.R
[29:24] Clark chief of U.S naval operations and
[29:27] acknowledging the confidential 1941
[29:29] member for the president he Hitler has
[29:32] every excuse in the world to declare war
[29:34] on us now if he were of a mind to now
[29:37] this is something that really only a
[29:39] prophet could know because to the world
[29:42] he was he was declaring peace he was
[29:45] declaring he just said just all kinds of
[29:48] little things going on behind the scenes
[29:49] that only God will know
[29:51] uh
[29:56] it's just summarizing
[29:59] not the magical line here's another
[30:01] objection
[30:03] brother random sometimes uses the word
[30:05] maginol on it and other times the C free
[30:07] line which was it
[30:09] he states that Germany built the magic
[30:12] online
[30:13] oh they just they just uh it gets me how
[30:17] you can kind of you can bend or it's
[30:18] called sophistry when you just bend
[30:20] words to make up your own argument and
[30:22] completely uh ignore the truth uh now
[30:26] this is back in the early prophecy we'll
[30:28] go to war with Germany and Germany will
[30:30] be fortified behind concrete and we will
[30:32] take an awful beating at this place
[30:35] that's what that's what the prophecy was
[30:39] we go in the Ephesian churches and we go
[30:41] to war with Germany and Germany would be
[30:43] fortified behind concrete and why are we
[30:46] not in the nomination Germany would rise
[30:47] up and put that Mangano line there
[30:51] and a super sign German people by me but
[30:53] he assured the German people about about
[30:55] building what we call imaginal mind of
[30:57] secret Landing for billions of dollars
[30:58] billions of tons of concrete is still
[31:00] together serious confidence in it that
[31:02] he moved his head of orders up to the
[31:03] front line where restaurants and
[31:05] business places operate underneath the
[31:07] ground and I imagine online was just a
[31:09] huge superstructure where they had train
[31:12] cars moving underground underneath it
[31:14] and just they could just stay under
[31:16] there for a long time it was just like a
[31:17] little Resort on there almost where they
[31:20] had billions of stealing cement no
[31:21] matter how it ever went Germany was
[31:23] fortified
[31:24] it was a sign of safety but the modern
[31:26] Blockbuster broke bloated into eternity
[31:28] and Hitler with it
[31:31] condemnation that Americans will take a
[31:32] great meeting in a meeting at a place
[31:34] that Germany will build which would be a
[31:36] great wall bill of concrete the imaginal
[31:37] line 11 years before it was ever built
[31:39] but finally there will be the victors
[31:42] so it's confusion about what the
[31:44] imaginary line is but if you look at it
[31:46] on the map this Germany and France are
[31:50] maybe about the size of Wisconsin and
[31:52] another state yeah
[31:54] you know there's a common comparison
[31:57] with the management online is what after
[31:59] World War One France built to keep
[32:01] Germany out and uh on the other side
[32:04] of the Magnolia line on the on the
[32:06] French side the imaginal line was was
[32:08] there on the others on the German side
[32:11] the Germans built the sieged feed line
[32:13] in that it went by another name until
[32:14] War II but uh the French only ran the
[32:17] magical lineup to about here because of
[32:19] the Big Forest up here so they thought
[32:21] that would keep the tank German tanks
[32:23] and everything else so they stopped the
[32:24] wall there and Germany built this uh
[32:27] they extended their seed free line all
[32:30] up so when you say management online see
[32:32] free line is just like right over there
[32:34] it's just like you know 50 feet or
[32:37] whatever it's the same thing there's no
[32:39] difference so the program says Seafood
[32:41] line imagine online it's the same it's
[32:43] just right across the way
[32:45] so over over the course of the war you
[32:48] know at some point in the war Germany
[32:51] would take over part of the magical line
[32:52] of up in the north and they'd still be
[32:55] fighting the French would be fighting on
[32:56] this against the C3 line down here and
[32:58] then vice versa so some parts of the
[33:00] wall it'd be the Germans would have
[33:02] control over the national line other
[33:03] parts of the wall The Fringe should have
[33:05] control over the seafood line so to to
[33:09] uh nitpick over a terminology it just
[33:12] don't make any sense because it's really
[33:14] it's the same it's this this line uh the
[33:17] demarcation between the two territories
[33:21] yeah
[33:23] so and then brother Brian talked about
[33:25] how we Face a lot of casual this is uh
[33:28] and this is another point of disputation
[33:31] and so these are the three big old huge
[33:34] conflicts uh that's a technical term big
[33:37] old huge
[33:45] the patents Lorraine campaign near Mets
[33:47] lost 55 182 men the Battle of hurricane
[33:50] Forest which was up north 24
[33:54] 000 and the biggest the battle of the
[33:55] Bulls lost 89 500 and I almost lost the
[33:59] whole first and Ninth us armies so to
[34:01] say that we didn't have casualties that
[34:03] the management line is just not really
[34:05] understand history
[34:06] the municipal Bridge
[34:09] now I was just going to talk about this
[34:10] real quick because this they say well we
[34:13] don't have any evidence of anybody
[34:14] falling off the bridge and this is
[34:16] Brother Brown's his vision was I counted
[34:18] 16 minutes fell off that breeding ground
[34:20] and I went and told them I told her I
[34:21] seen it and so it worked for me for that
[34:24] so if they say we can't find any
[34:26] historical documents we're having us to
[34:27] pull them to stay on the 16 men died
[34:29] during the construction and it's
[34:31] additionally it's clear that William
[34:32] Brown state that 16 men died by Drowning
[34:34] so they're looking at at Hard Evidence
[34:36] over from over a hundred years ago some
[34:38] newspaper or something that has evidence
[34:40] so this is what they put on their
[34:41] website the video below they made a
[34:44] little video of what uh say in their
[34:47] Viewpoint the video below contains an
[34:49] error and that it indicates there were
[34:51] no fatalities in the building of the
[34:53] municipal Bridge because first they said
[34:55] there are no there are no fatalities
[34:58] then they had to withdraw it oops never
[35:00] mind
[35:01] we actually did find two fatalities and
[35:04] then they kept going on up
[35:05] so uh it's just a it's just a broad
[35:08] statement to say there's no
[35:10] uh
[35:12] you know I was listening to Peregrine's
[35:14] testimony about how he said that the
[35:15] mayor of Jeffersonville knew that
[35:17] brother Brown was a prophet because he
[35:19] knew that when that when brother Brown
[35:21] was a little boy he told about that
[35:23] bridge being built now irregardless of
[35:26] how many people fell off that bridge he
[35:27] knew that Bill Brown was a prophet
[35:29] because that breed was built brother
[35:31] random knew it would be built before
[35:32] like 11 years before they ever built it
[35:37] did Brother Brown say he would be alive
[35:40] to see The Return of Jesus Christ
[35:42] now this is another way they twist the
[35:45] the doctrine because in first
[35:46] Thessalonians it teaches you know this
[35:48] is this is what they're twisting
[35:51] that we which are alive and remain in
[35:53] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[35:54] them which are asleep for the Lord
[35:56] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[35:58] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[35:59] with the truth of God in which are alive
[36:01] and remain Shall be Called together
[36:02] within the clouds so of course will be
[36:05] alive to see him physically return
[36:08] did anyone die after brother Brandon
[36:10] prayed for them well
[36:16] um
[36:18] oh my you know many people build them
[36:23] right exactly
[36:31] and then they're associated with Jim
[36:33] Jones with the message how was Jim Jones
[36:35] associated with missionary you know he
[36:36] went he's the one that uh
[36:40] they're saying Jim Jones started looking
[36:42] famous when he held a series of services
[36:44] with the help of William Brown like the
[36:45] Cato Tabernacle in Indianapolis Indiana
[36:47] so it's soft Street yeah they're making
[36:49] it sound like brother Graham went out of
[36:51] his way to pull this brother in and set
[36:54] up a meeting and all this kind of stuff
[36:55] well what really happened was um
[36:58] uh
[37:01] uh Jones organized I'm I'm just reading
[37:03] I'll figure it he organized the mammoth
[37:05] religious convention in June 11th
[37:07] through June 15 1956 in an Indianapolis
[37:10] Hall called Cato Tabernacle this was way
[37:12] before he began to go into all his
[37:14] on beliefs to draw the crowds DM needed
[37:17] a religious headliner and so he arranged
[37:19] to share the with brother Randall a
[37:21] healing evangelist and religious offers
[37:23] highly agreed by something going Robert
[37:24] this is actually taking off from
[37:26] Wikipedia so the critique is well why he
[37:29] was a prophet why didn't he know that
[37:32] this man would go off into into into
[37:34] Cults and different things now so
[37:38] if he was a prophet so what are some
[37:40] examples of prophets in the Bible that
[37:42] didn't didn't that some things were
[37:44] hidden from them what about Jesus that
[37:46] uh
[37:49] Jesus was right in his midst and and he
[37:53] knew he actually knew but he he uh
[37:55] allowed things to continue and what
[37:57] about Jacob they said he was a prophet
[38:00] he said where is Southern Joseph he
[38:02] didn't he wasn't aware that his son
[38:03] Joseph was down in Egypt all that time
[38:05] and just you can keep going on and on
[38:08] about how God
[38:10] you know Billy Paul came to brother
[38:12] Randleman and told him I'm going to get
[38:14] married tomorrow and he said get next to
[38:17] yourself son because God had hidden that
[38:19] from me and then he went and got married
[38:20] but um
[38:22] well gone ahead from Elijah when a
[38:25] little woman baby died
[38:27] right that's the baby died he said to
[38:30] God told me anything
[38:32] he hidden those things from me so
[38:35] yeah
[38:37] yeah I believe God knows what you need
[38:40] to know and that's that thing around you
[38:42] every thought he'd go you'd go crazy
[38:47] about that a lot about Revelation about
[38:49] the things that we know now if I if we
[38:51] had known 15 years ago or so we just
[38:53] it'd just blow them up right you go
[38:56] you'd be crazy you've been up yeah
[38:57] exactly
[39:01] and uh this last one we'll just end on
[39:04] this program so the Democracy it won't
[39:06] last more than 200 years
[39:10] at Alexander Tyler
[39:13] in 1700s or so wrote a democracy is
[39:17] always temporary
[39:19] it simply cannot exist as a permanent
[39:22] form of illness but democracy will
[39:24] continue to exist until the voters
[39:26] gifts from the public Traders from that
[39:29] moment the majority will always vote for
[39:31] the candidates who promised the most
[39:32] benefits from public treasure would
[39:34] result that every democracy will finally
[39:35] collapse and the example that he used
[39:37] was the Athenian government
[39:39] Athens and Greece they were a democracy
[39:42] where the people actually voted directly
[39:44] from the for the ruling of the
[39:46] government and what happened was 200
[39:48] years after Athens became a democracy
[39:50] they started killing people Socrates and
[39:52] Plato and all those famous people were
[39:54] killed because they their ideas opposed
[39:57] the ideas of people and that's when the
[39:59] Democracy failed and uh so we'll just
[40:02] stop right there awesome you gotta also
[40:04] remember too before 1976 would have been
[40:07] the 200th year right right you know what
[40:09] Gerald Ford was not an elected president
[40:13] remember yeah
[40:15] what's his name they were going to
[40:18] impeach him and he resigned information
[40:20] then he was not loaded in he just became
[40:24] president he wasn't a voted president so
[40:27] to me then the democracy is over that's
[40:29] good that was before 1976.
