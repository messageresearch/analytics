how big that thing was and the whole church fit in it with no problem when we gonna have about half of that with the couples then we have we have a we have a place to uh run around hey man but uh come and enjoy yourself we've always had a good time this is number i don't know how many this is mom how many numbers is this number 11. this is number 11. we've seen people grow up first get married now they've been married 10 11 years and and then all of us all in the same way so and we'll be doing the newlywed game too so you better get to know your spouse a little bit quicker a little bit more some of you don't know anything about your spouse so anyway but um we always have fun and we'll have fun in the lord too we want to thank brother dale in the church for always furnishing everything and always supporting it so it's good for the couples to uh just kind of have a night out like terrence said though now is the time to get your babysitters because they won't be bringing no cheering this is just adults only tickles me when i say that certain brother stood up here one day and said he waited till his grandkids went to bed and they went and watched an adult movie brother dick knew what he was talking about but nobody else did he meant a movie like a war movie or something he could watch but he was he was we were all stunned when he said that but that's kind of the way it is we're going to do adult things when we get there and have fun in the lord and uh i thank god for my spouse you couldn't get like brother um john hit it on the head he said that was my better half and some of you would say bitter but it's a better half you're better half but thank goodness for valentine's day i i'm i'm hoping everybody spends valentine's day every day with their spouse amen because because if that's what the lord gave you bud brother the prophet of god said outside of salvation that's the greatest thing god could compliment a man with is a beautiful spouse amen and the character that she brings because you know what that's our character because we're the bride of jesus christ so that's our character showing to jesus christ what we think of him to hear on the earth and he is happy for us to be his bride amen so let's go to first john 4. brother colley read been reading the scripture so he responsive read it this morning but he read a lot of it and we're just going to read one through six but we're not i told you we're going to finish but i i found there's one more little item we need to cover today and like i said before please please remember one thing i am not speaking of any one person we're talking about spirits there's two spirits that we got to deal with not people spirits now you can get possessed with them and then you become one with it but it's the two spirits that we're dealing with the spirit of christ and the spirit of the antichrist all right and that's the two things that we're dealing with and we also have to deal with and not speaking against any denomination you heard the prophet talking about it you know but there is a thing that god hates he hates nicoletism he hates the conquering of the laity so if god hates it we got to hate it if god hates it we hate it god saw what it would do to the people we see what it's doing to the people it's binding them and not making them free in the lord so before we read the scripture let's bow our heads the heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us another opportunity to come and serve you lord we pray now that you would just bless us with your presence lord we appreciate the song service we just had lord to feel the presence of the lord now lord this is another anointing lord where you speak to your people father and i pray that you would move this vessel out of the way and just speak through it father do the revealing lord you do the speaking father just be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here the ones that are hindered father in many different ways we pray that you would just unbind lord the ones that are bound and you can only do it lord thank you by asking you father and the word says that you would do it for us forgive us of our many sins and mistakes lord that we make just be with us and guide us in jesus name we pray amen first john four verse one now today we're going to talk about two spirits same thing separation time part two because there's got to be a separation if god hates something and he's in you then you're going to hate it but i'm going to show you in the very end that's what i didn't get to last on wednesday night is is they're going to hate you just like they hate jesus and they're going to kill you thinking they're doing god's service that's happened since the dawn of time amen that's happened since the dawn of time man has killed christians thinking they were doing god's service amen and then we're talking about the seals which are in the bible according to the book of revelations there in six altered revelations eight and we see that the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for a space of a half an hour there was nothing to be revealed is what the prophet said so let's read this beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ is coming the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and as i told you before it's not just words it's not just something you say you gotta literally believe that man walked on earth 2000 years ago but that same man that walked on earth 2000 years ago in spirit form today is inside of you same guy not another person same guy and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is coming the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world 2 000 years ago year of god little children have overcome them because greater see this in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god hereth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error and you may be seen in the lord that is blessing to reading the word i want to hurry through this a little bit at first not so much but let's read the first first john 5 verse 18 it says we know look at this or we know john we know that whosoever is born of god sentence not but he that is begotten of god now brother dale's talking about begotten we have we are begotten by a lively hope we are not begotten of god by our first birth our first birth was a carnal knowledge of a man and a woman getting together and by desire not according to god but allowed by god to get you here makes that your second birth is more important than your first birth once you get born but you got to get born first time first right but as brother dale said that genesis 1 26 man is not all mankind it's not every person that walks on the face of the earth because not everybody is the children of god by that birth by that begetting or begotten remember jesus christ is the first begotten of the father well if he's the first begotten who's arrest we are the rest we're the rest of the begotten of the father in other words if there's a beginning of the creation of god that constitutes that something began but if that's the only person the bible should have just said he's the only one no paul keeps talking telling us many times he's be he's begetting or begotten us to what to a lively hope he he begot us all right so by our second birth know you not whosoever is born of god sinneth not that didn't say whoever's born of mom and daddy that says whoever is born of god by your new birth sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not now sometimes we get up in the morning and don't kind of think that scripture's telling the truth but it is that inside man is who he's talking about he's not talking about the outside guy talk about the inside guy that wicked one toucheth him not because listen if you're born again your soul is a hot fire coal that satan can't touch he can't touch it he can't even play with your soul it's sealed now you can play with your flesh and he can play with your spirit but he cannot play with that soul that soul is begotten of god it is god no no less no more that's what brother dale's trying to get us to see that we're god almighty and human flesh just like jesus was god almighty and human flesh except for the virgin birth amen but see if you negate your first birth then you are leaning towards your second birth and that's the one we need to look at and we know here's po john again and we know that we are of god and the whole world life and wickedness so the whole world is going to be against us i want to tell you today when we get toward the end of this thing remember one thing's for sure the bible tells us that we that the son of man would be in the end time just as he was when he walked on the earth in the days of the son of man what the myth in other words the mystery of god's going to be revealed the son of man is coming out what is the son of man god in human flesh and if they persecuted the son of man himself they're going to persecute me and you there was a division that the division was not what he they knew who he was as the person oh that's the carpenter boy or that's joseph's son or that's the illegitimate child but they they never come to an understanding that he was almighty god in human flesh came exactly the way how about a man standing up in a temple and say show me one place show me one now all they had was the torah the old testament they had the old testament show me one place where i don't fulfill all this right oh you're of your father the devil oh no no jesus said no you're of your father the devil because see they call they didn't call him just a devil they called him beelzebub the king of devils right now what are they going to do to me and you same thing but remember i'm going to read a quote in a minute that i read the other day but it really struck me to go back to read it again and i see why i read it because remember remember this is a journey it's not a one-day ordeal this is a journey all right it's like dave ramsey said this is not a this is not a we're not into a microwave religion this is the crockpot religion it takes a while to cook us and get us made and get us going we always want to go well i just want to be up there at the top of the pyramid when i get started no you can't do that you were a baby when you were born you did baby things you made baby mistakes and then you grew up and i hope you're not doing the baby things anymore amen and we know that the son of god has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life all right so we good with that we know that the son of god has come and has given us an understanding now remember john is the only one that was commissioned jesus when he was on earth he pretty much told john if john would have got the revelation that john was going to live to see a second coming but not the literal second coming he was going to see it in the book of revelations by symbols he was going to see christ come to the church he was going to see him in the golden candlesticks he was going to see him come back in revelations 19 and all these things that he showed john but remember every other person every other person that was around jesus either left him or died either left him remember the 40 that left the 70 that left oh they left no more recording of that but the 11 that stayed 12. judas killed himself but the 11 that stayed they all died of martyr's death except one and that was john but john was given the commission to stay and live the length of life so he could what write this for me and you somebody had to record this so in this first john this is john telling you what god has given him because he knew he was walking with him remember he was the youngest he was just a little a little loud when jesus was around he was the one that was always around him and and laying on his bosom and all the things like that but right here he's an older man he's been to patmos he's been he had his life you know going up into the 90 year old and he'd been in his life and he says we know that we are of god and the whole world life and wickedness in other words at that time think about it at that time john had lost every 11 of the original disciples plus him number 12. 11 of the original disciples were dead they were all they were all gone he had seen them get murdered by what for what they believed now this may not be an exciting sermon today but it's the truth the separating time is going to show right who's got the goods his brother donny's daddy always said who's got the goods and who don't have the goods amen because there will be a separating time so let's read now an exposition of the seven church ages read this again as we've read it before christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts like i said before listen as we'll look down here in just a minute uh pilate said what is truth well then i i looked upon the internet which must be true you can laugh there were thirty thousand worldwide christian organizations and twelve hundred different christian organizations and just in the united states alone now god's not that confused no way and people have certain amounts of truth but jesus said i'm not part truth he said i am the truth the way the truth so now christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts now how is the difference in the true church and the false church there's not much difference we're not talking about evil out in the world bar rooms and prostitute no we're talking about two churches we'll talk see just a minute where they're intertwined you've got the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life in the garden of eden they now are grown together so much to most people come on somebody most people can't tell the difference because they said jesus said this will deceive the very elect if it were possible this good verse is evil that we've always we we hear people talk about good and evil and the fight between good and evil and yeah they might know what they're talking about but they don't really know what they're talking about good versus evil is doctrine good versus evil is not democrat and politic and republican it's not without there and out here no it's in here this is where the fight is the fight's right here but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church in other words intertwine it defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless but it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and destruct discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's counted in the lake of fire listen he still fights even though a thousand years he can't do anything what an adversary for a thousand years he can't touch anybody because he has nothing to work with but then a little while after that god releases him out of that prison out of that bottomless pit that's bible and he goes on a rampage again gets one more shot but his one more shot is as fruitless as the shots he's given now amen we may listen i like to do the things of the world as far as going outside me and jim we're kind of mapping out our whole year of festivals and things to plant in the garden and the beekeeping stuff and you know the thought came to me where the prophet of god he said if you're gonna plant potatoes he said go ahead and plant the potatoes if you're gonna get married tomorrow go ahead and get married tomorrow listen don't negate all your plans and just say all right i'm going to go home shut the doors because jesus is coming no go about your regular life but live your life like jesus is coming tomorrow so that you will be ready in the time that the thief that does come in the night to the true bride we're going to be called away folks and nobody's going to know it it's going to be such a little group a little group not even going to we're not gonna move the needle in population as far as the world goes listen if it was eight souls it was saved and that types of denominations and the foolish virgin and enoch was one man that took a body chain he went up and didn't go through any tribulation that's why i love this the revelation that we don't have to go through tribulation we might have to go through persecution but we will not have to go through tribulation and if you'll read in revelations i'm going back and reading the book of revelations you keep reading in revelations where the bible says that your skin is going to fall off of your bones while you're still alive now that's a nuclear explosion you know that because that's the the fallout that makes you but makes your skin fall off and all these different and people are going to cry to die and can't well if you're getting christ you won't have to worry about that see that's one of those fallacies that denominations teach you that we got to go through tribulation there's nowhere in the bible that the bride now the church does but there's no that's why i want to get into maybe some of these doctrinal issues and show how that that listen if you can't separate bride church and different you'll get them all mixed up right like the man did with brother brown he's a brother um how in the world can the bride be sitting here and the church be sitting here and this and me sitting here he said oh there's a difference between a bride and a church for this version church bride cup of water just regular centers there's a difference but you got to know the difference and able to read this book called the book of revelations amen he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit state will be powerless before her now let's go to that what is truth when we go back in the book of genesis and we look many many thousands of years ago there was two doctrines cain's doctrine and abel's doctrine amen cain's doctrine was wrong kane's doctrine was false cain's doctrine was not true abel's doctrine was true but who died cain killed abel because of his doctrine not because he found out he was his half brother he killed him because god gave notice to abel sacrifice and he told cain if you will change and do better i'll accept yours and cain said brother brown said take it or leave it buddy this is all i'm doing in other words my doctrine is right i don't care what you say in other words i don't care what the word says i'm going to do what my doctrine or my denomination says be careful be careful because that's cain and cain what did cain do cain's biggest mistake was as he walked out from the presence of the lord he left what could have saved him amen same way with you and me but then we see cain and abel but now what about judas and jesus they were in the same camp they were in the same place they were in the same church together judas was everywhere jesus was at he probably went to church more than the rest of them did because he was a money holder he was a guy that was right there and finally jesus said go do what you need to do and all the time he was the son of perdition or not the antichrist but he did have an antichrist spirit in him because he did not want anything to do with that doctrine that jesus was preaching now we come down to where to the book of revelations where we see there is what christ and the antichrist all right it starts as a beast it's going to end as a beast starts as a beast in the garden it's going to end with the beast in the end time but now i see iran comes about and we see and in nicea rome in 325 and 606 a.d we proved that there was people come from all over the world into this place and they were getting this new light you just heard what brother brown said this morning he said people from from irena's people from martin people from different ones came to that place but what did they do they were overpowered by the antichrist spirit because there was nothing of christ that came out of that all it was was romanism all it was was the changing of all doctrines listen the original doctrine i want you to somebody show me i we got the original doctrine there was no three gods there was no trinity there was no water baptism in the name of father son holy ghost there was no eternal hell there was no going through the tribulation there was none of that doctrine now sure there were little sayings as we got here before we read in first john 4 every spirit that confesses not to jesus come in the flesh look and it says it's already in the world take it to the next one and then we go to the opening of the book keep going a little bit further but it began as a saying it became began as a what a baby a little saying well i don't i don't know if that's right or not then it became a deed then it became a doctrine you know what they started building churches on that they started building their doctrines on that they went back and i never thought about but you heard it this morning where brother was talking about they went back and had an old testament they went back to an old testament form of of a priests and popes they went backwards they didn't go forwards they went backwards to apostolic secession and all these different things because that's really what the levites was the levite died his son took over if the son died the other one took over they had boys and they took over well that's kind of like they brought it over and also there was moses and then one thing i can't understand is is they had peter as the first pope and he had a wife and now their popes can't have wives i can't understand that right i mean the bible says that jesus prayed for peter's mother-in-law i kind of i guess that would mean he had a wife amen i'm glad you know what the bible put that in there to prove that doctrine but what it took it took a prophet to look at the roman catholic church and say you got peter's the first pope and he had a wife now your your popes can't have wives look at what they got theirself into by not having wives amen pretty good history about all that right we'll not get into it but it took the opening of the book it took the opening of the seals in the end time because really all these doctrines were shut up by that doctrine that came out in nicaea 325 and 606 amen and then it was accepted all the way through the dark ages it was accepted even in martin luther and it was accepted in john wesley but remember they had a piece of a message to bring the just shall live by faith apart from all that other stuff novena's crawling on the floor uh you know beating yourself and all those different things well well that's not bible the bible says believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god not by works not by the beating of yourself for paying no venues but look how low look how though that doctrine that was 606 and here we are in 2021 and it's still going on but now you try to bring the doctrine of the first three church ages of no eternal hell and no water baptism in the name of father son holy ghost and all that you start trying to bring that over and interject it anywhere guess what happens you get put out of the house you see where i'm talking about those two spirits they're religious sometimes i'm kind of inclined that you can carry on a better conversation with a sinner than you can with somebody that that's uh that's supposed to be a christian because once you get somebody that's supposed to be a christian and and they're living in sin and they're drinking beer and they're cursing every few minutes and you start telling them that those things are wrong they ain't not gonna like you but if you tell a sinner he's a sinner he's like yep i am i know i am i'm drinking and smoking and gutting and all these effort you understand that's what we're going to get to here when we look and see where the prophet of god says the end of all things now remember technically the seventh seal is not the end of all things hold on i got a quote at the end of the seventh seal is the end of all things see that's the part that i didn't cover the other day because remember we're just like all the seven seals like all the first seals like remember the prophet says they overlap they lap from one to the other all right so you got a little bit coming in here in a little bit but i'll read it in just a second i'm getting a little ahead of myself well let's go to number two you got justification sanctification we believe in the baptism of the holy ghost an incarnate christ not an incarnate pope or incarnate cardinal or whatever you want to call it let's read number two now to get the real meaning of this i must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion is composed of two parts that intertwine but are as opposite as white black and white religion and the spiritual world are made of these two trees which had their roots in eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other thus in the ephesian church age is the same paradox the church is made up of good and bad two vines make the church they are like the wheat and tares growing up side by side but one is true the other is false now god will speak to each one now here's the here's the paradox is god will speak to each one god will let them believe a lie because he knows they're not going to believe the truth and he will talk about each one and he will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true spirit now see the only the elect can read the bible and say oh that's talking about the church oh that's talking about the bride oh that's talking about the foolish virgin you can't read the book of revelation and get it right without listening to the prophet sorry and led by the holy ghost led by the holy ghost listen to what the prophet said that's what a prophet does a prophet what interprets he's a divine interpreter not bringing in more or advertising taking no he gives us clarity to what's already been spoken and he will call them the church and only the elect will know which is the true spirit only the elect will not be deceived so there's your only the elect will not be deceived for matthew 24 24 says there arise false christ false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so way back there in the early church a very short period after pentecost the false fine got to intertwine itself around the true vine we find these deeds of the nicolaitans and that spirit is going to be found finding the true vine look until it is destroyed by god now have you got it and it's going to be there according to matthew 13 jesus said in the parable they don't have this but while men slept the enemy came and sowed tares in other words the tares and the wheat both sprang up in the in the parable that jesus tells the servants of the household come and said sir did you not sow good seed in your field for where's these tares and he said look an enemy has done it the servant said well let's go in other words let's go and gather it up jesus said matthew 13 29 nay lest while you gather up the tares you root up the wheat in other words let them grow to harvest let them grow to harvest this is harvest time now that's why you gather up the tares you root up the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles separate them and burn them because remember what's going to happen there's only going to be in this new garden of eden there's only going to be the tree of life there will never be the tree of knowledge of good and evil after we take a body change and after we go into the marriage supper and after we get now remember be careful in the millennium it's still there the tree of knowledge of good and evil because satan's not done away with but now in this future home this new home that we john saw come down out of heaven they won't be but one tree and that is the tree of life and you and i will be doing the same thing we'll be right there with that tree of life eating the fruit off of that tree hey man what a great day what makes your eyes water because you don't you do the thing you look at all this junk's going on in the world and man they're in an uproar about everything and and sure it kind of makes you a little bit nervous but you know what it shouldn't make you nervous we like i said before we've done red we've not read the book we don't read tomorrow's news today we had a prophet come tell us exactly what was going to happen so i have no qualms about who's in the white house because it's right there where god wants them right or whatever is going to happen in this world economy and everything else sure there's uncertainty many times but we look and we see that that the prophet told us though if we could get to what if we can know where those two spirits are withstand the antichrist spirit that god said we'd be an invincible army now how are you going to lose from that you can't lose but you've got to go through the journey as brother ram says i'll show you read it to yourself at the end of the seventh seal is the end of all things not at the beginning so there must be a beginning where the book is open but you and i have to go through a journey amen what did what did the first seal do the first rider the seal broke what happened the first rider rode off and the second seal didn't open until the second right he gets off of the first horse and gets on the second horseman now brother brown said that the horse just keeps on riding why because that white righteous church is still here today the red horse is still here today the black horse is still here today and obviously the writer is still here today but he has moved on up and become from a baby farm to where he doesn't want to be god i mean be like god he wants to be god right and you know who's going to make him god us with our denominational ideas are going to make him that's what's going to put come on people that's what's going to put that beast that's what's going to elevate him i'll promise you they'll say it's the lord the beast is not gonna be listen to me a true preacher he's not going to preach no eternal hell he's not going to preach and take care of take his father son holy ghost baptism out ah he's the epitome of false he's not going to change but the whole world listen i hate to say this but the whole world is already deceived by him already we're sitting here under that deception you look at all other denominations and you see that they're this close to that mother church remember the bible says there was a mother and she had daughters i'm still in the bible now what are daughters what are women churches amen you had the mother and then you had all of her daughters what that accepted the system that they're in all right i hate to say it but you know what that's what jesus stood up and said he said in other words whatever doctrine you're teaching because i'm going to read it here in a minute because they identified their self as children of abraham and they were by lineage we have moses as our father jesus said if you believe moses you believe me we have our underline whatever you want to underline baptist methodist pentecostal brandonism whatever you want to call it we have that jesus said um if you believe them you'd believe me right listen as we look here's my whole point as we look at jesus in the bible doing what he's supposed to do he was the word made flesh right he was everything the bible up to that point had said about him everything didn't miss it and they killed him for being who the bible said he was going to be well not me and you we may not physically die but we sure get it in other ways listen let's go to number four skip that one because we know the two spirits are going to go in their separate destinations the two vines will have to there will have to be a separating time between the wheat and the tares okay number four though all right let's go down to the bottom well now let's read it all i'm sorry now the church life is at the end the normal church the church now this is 1960 before the seals open now this may stick just a little bit but the church carnal the esau church she's come to her in what's she doing heading up in the federation of churches which will finally join the romanism to fight catholicism and he stopped and it's catholicism to fight communism you got to remember when when brother branham was teaching in the 50s and the 60s man they just knew communism was the antichrist because communism this and communism he said don't worry about communism he said god raised up communism so the romanism could take over wow pope john is calling for all the churches to come back now that's 1960 what about now and i'll tell you a little story in just a second bob you got to help me with this and they'll unite themselves together just exactly what thus saith the lord remember we watched that thing that willie had showed us at your house on the painted fire picture the pope today is standing up and what do they call it it's it's so close but remember he comes in with flattery he brings all the economies together and that's what his whole speech was and then they had i'm talking about when i say rothschild does that mean anything to anybody bill gates can't hold a bathroom compared to the rothschilds and all those different ones that are way above the bill gates you're talking about the bilderberg people they are all in with the pope and it's not called socialism now and that's exactly all democratic is of socialism and here we got democratic president we got democrat everybody so we got socialism don't worry about it but pope is standing up and saying what do you say bring them all together and then you've got the rothschild lady you've got a head of this company i'm talking about lightweight i ain't talking about bill gates bill gates to these people are chumps and he's worth 60 billion dollars right this is way up above that and they've got every one of them on a video and they're not calling it socialism but it's more of a form of capitalism that everybody shares everything well now that's socialism folks and i'm not into politics but i'm telling you it's romanism it's the pope taking over he stood right in the middle of that video and he told him he said oh this is the greatest thing and then all the other ones was like this is the greatest thing and you know what if you sat there and watched it and you poor man like me you look at him and go man that sounds pretty good they go give me some of their money not listen when you have a socialistic society people do get rich see in a socialistic society though it's supposed to be that if i make ten billion dollars and he makes two dollars i give him some of mine and we become equal ain't it happening ain't never happening ain't never gonna happen you've got you're rich and you got your poor and that's just the way it is but remember this is array got raised up catholicism to fight communism you know what they done what did they do the pope why i'm going this way i don't know the pope and ronald reagan gets together and busts up all the communism states right remember russia they they just broke them and it went back into yugoslavia poland and all the different ones it broke up into the different different states but remember the prophet of god said thus saith the lord you watch russia the bear's not dead the bear's still there but they're going to unite that video was so nice it was it had some really pretty music behind didn't it bro bob it was just like it was on a rock get asleep we're going to take this new form of capitalism to the world and you know what they want you to join right they look right at you and go you need to come and join this with us this is going to be the new wave and the pope's up there going this is the new wave you just wait and see folks we're heading to something but we're heading to something we are guaranteed we're not going to get caught up in that the true bride not the church the true bride will not get caught up in them number five the breach between the seven church ages but just think about those things i don't know maybe i'll get bob to pull it up for me and we'll or to find it brother william had it on his phone but it was just a real i mean it just like had butterflies and doves and birds and things chirping i mean it was just like you're like oh man this is great no it's bringing everything together under the head of one man the pope amen and all the other denominations are going to follow right behind them amen number five a seal signifies a finished work and when the seventh seal is broken now watch when the seven seal is broken they talk about breaking it on the breach everybody got that when the seventh hill is broken but now that's not the end of the seventh seal that's when it breaks the mystery of god that's sealed up in these mysterious seals is finished in other words it's got to go through and it will be finished until the day the seal is broken then it's revealed what's on the inside of it in other words remember what he said about the boxcar that's what we're looking at the boxcar remember is what you don't know what's behind it if a man's wondering what's in the boxcar you say it's supposed to be such and such it's supposed to be he's presuming man has been presuming for thousands of years but listen there's not presuming in god there's truth everything else is there but when the seal is broken the door is open now look the door is open everybody got that right but there's something in there right and it's got to be revealed right right man and that's only done at the end time right now well what's inside that box car the real bride the one that's gonna make it oh i hope this hits your heart listen you got something to do with this every bit of this is centered around you every bit of this bible this end time word that's come together is centered on me and you i was thinking god this morning of all the continents he let me go to and all the places and all the people he's allowed me to meet because of this message of the hour and to know that that is truth we're not going out searching for truth truth is here now look at number six now remember remember you got a box car you got product in the car you got a door that's sealed but the products in there but now it's like i said before but what if you what if you like pizza you like pizza or steak steak burn pizza huh steak okay my steak boy but now what if you knew you said what smells like steak i don't know what's in that box car but what if somebody comes by and opens it what if some man some prophet comes and opens the door and and and what's he going to do is he going to stand in the door and say now i know you like steak but you can't have none of that no a true man of god is going to say that thing's full have at it so that's what the seventh seal did when i believe the prophet when the seals opened here in the end time it was not to finish everything at that moment as far as moment of time right here but it was going towards something because i want to eat what's in that box car i like steak too amen to watch what he says oh look we must remember that this seventh seal book is the end of time of all things that's right the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the plan of redemption see nobody's ever been able to get the plan of redemption right until now the water baptism and the way to get justified the way to get sanctified the baptists have a real good once saved always saved justification because god will forgive you of your past sins but you got to keep going not shake somebody's hand and five years later come back to church and keep doing what you're doing no the bible says the unclean spirit goes out right in sanctification and then the baptism of holy ghost it's not just a feeling or a sensation or a shaking of hand or or this it's god almighty coming in and changing you burning out the old you that's this bit the book that sealed up to the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world it ever been ends it is the end is the end of the struggling world the end of the struggling nature the end of everything now look watch this this is where i got it in there is the end of the trumpets now when does the trumpet ends the trumpets don't end while we're here the feast of the trumpets to israel ends when the way over 144 000. you see this journey but the seal had to open here to a bride for us to be able to preach it as brother dale's preaching it for the body change and the different things we had to have that boxcar open and partake of what's in the boxcar then it shows us listen we got a clear path all the way to where we're going to live eternally in a home without any question i don't have to go ask father so-and-so what's going on because father so-and-so may tell you something else besides what other father so-and-so said amen but now remember as we want to get to in a minute they come to jesus and ask him questions and they did not believe what he said because he didn't tell them the normal of their doctrine amen that's why we're not very normal because we have to be like jesus christ was we have to be where the whole world you know what the sinners didn't hate jesus the prostitutes didn't hate jesus some of the republicans they didn't hate jesus who hated him the religious world hated him that antichrist spirit that was in those people hated jesus christ and so it will in the end time it is the end the end of the struggling world it's the end of the struggle of nature it's the end of everything and there's the end of the trumpets the end of the vials now remember the vials get poured out after we're gone it's the end of the earth the earth gets after we're gone it's even the end of time time runs out bible says now look the time runs out literal time on earth doesn't run out until the future home starts because during the millennium you still have time right but now watch what he says the bible said so matthew 7 i remain in revelations 10 1-7 time runs out the angel says time will be no longer the day is this great thing to happen now watch everything runs out in this time the end of at the end of this seventh seal now it's open here today if you believe it but the culmination of it is not going to be over here until we walk into the future home all right same way with jesus christ now remember when he was born he was born a baby he was still born emmanuel god with us he didn't change into god in his journey and what was he he was the seventh seal but he had to come to an end so that you and i could come to the beginning he had to die he had the ascent or he had to come back he had to take on a glorified body he had to ascend and he had to come back so that he could further that seventh seal ending in me and you down here in the bride now i'm talking about the bride ain't talking about the 144 thousand i ain't talking about the church i'm done with the bride the bride has an ending of a seventh seal it's when we take a body change because it's when jesus christ has revealed himself just like he was back then what brother dale's been talking about amen at the end of this seventh seal now watch notice it's the end of the church age it's the end of the seven seals at the end of the trumpets the end of the biles ends the ushering in of the millennium that's on that seventh seal it's like firing a rocket all right we'll reap to skip time go to revelations 10 7. but in the days of the voice there's got to be six angels got to be seven angels sound when this seventh angel sounds all right revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel an angel is what a messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery one mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and what have i told you that mystery was paul told you what that mystery was the great mystery of the gentiles is christ in you the hope of glory and if christ is in you are you gonna have three or four different ideas i don't think so but how we come to jesus had to come to an end his life on earth came to an end on easter or on a good friday jesus died right he died a physical death he died went to the grave his body was dead and cold but he resurrected because he said he was going to resurrect and he resurrected because the old testament said he was going to resurrect i'll leave not leave my soul in hell or leave my holy one to see corruption so within the three days he came back up and what did he do though being god almighty and human flesh though now when he was on earth he didn't save one person yeah oh he told the prostitute go on and sin no more um you know you understand what i'm saying but there was no birth of a of a family member until the day of pentecost so on the day of pentecost that started to me that see that started that seventh seal it opened on the day of pentecost because that was christ he is those seals he is those what the very redemption plan he came to to to to give us started on the day of pentecost no other now sure there's pieces in there you understand what i mean they'll be given eternal life i'm talking about the genesis 1 26 the bride people the people that were inside of him when he was on the cross came out the seal brother brown says the seal of death was broke glory to what to show not just jesus christ he's to show you oh i got to go away but i'm coming back i'm not coming back to confuse you though that was the antichrist he comes to confuse christ does not come to confuse but listen to this real quick then we'll close number seven let's read it i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this bible real let me ask you a question how many of you read the bible before you came in the message raise your hands about 70 of the people you read a little different though didn't you did you not when you read these mysteries or these things that are not mystery anymore like brother tatum used to say oh brother tell him bless his heart i miss him we'll see he said he'd read he you know i guess he was pentecostal battle he's probably baptist he'd read he said i'd turn that bible and i'd read matthew 28 19. jesus said go into all the world preach the gospel baptize in the name of the father name of the son or the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost he said but when i got over there to acts 2 38 he said i did this why he didn't want to read what was written already in the word of god it was contrary to what what to what somebody had told him right now what the bible says but contrary to what somebody had told him and you know what it does every once in a while how many times have you when you come into the mess of the hour and you hear the certain things and there's still that little gnawing inside goes i don't know if that's right or not man i've been talk since i was a baby how to be baptized i've been taught since i was a baby that these things were whatever like i said before you know mom was walking on the streets to go with the lord no he's no she's not that's that's not bible that's that's somebody told you that right your mom ain't walking on the streets to go with jesus right now that's in the that's over in the future home way long time from here they're in another dimension and they're waiting to see jesus but they're not with him right now but we see that if you but then what do you do what do you do now though you read the bible just like hattie wright said and when you read it you said that ain't nothing but the truth it can't be all other way it can't be but so let's let's take this situation let's go to john 6 verse 53. now we've seen some strange things listen uh look at me don't look at that turn that off thank you i like it when they do what i think we come to situations though where we did come to the message of the hour to the truth or whatever you want to call i say the message of the hour everybody has a message there is a message but listen there's not 16 different one message of the hour there's only one message for each church age for each hour and we are under number seven right but when we start talking about these things it becomes strange like i read you in first john the world heareth what the world wants to hear but we hear what we hear right all right so now let me set the stage here's the most come here you still in the front room will usually anyway come on sorry this is kaifus you think i was going to be that okay this is that no this is jesus i'm kaifus now look i'm the high priest right everybody say uh-huh uh-huh i'm the high priest i am the most religious person on the face of the earth at the moment according to the world according to the torah according to isaiah according to amen i have not one spot against my lineage i don't eat cheese and all that other stuff together with something i don't eat uh dead animals you understand what i mean i don't eat pork i don't eat anything whatever the bible tells me to do at the moment i don't do it because i cannot be the high priest without that happening so guess what i'm the headstone of that message of that hour oh yeah right none higher i'm caiaphas and i got all my caffs and little conferences around me right and they're the same way they're the same way they read the torah every day they read the prophets every day right so here walks this man up just a common guy he don't have one like good robes and he's probably a little you know he's been out in the desert and you know he's hair's all messed up but he comes walking in and he starts saying things strange to what i live by that sound familiar strange to what i live he says strange things strange man what but yet this man is the word of god there's not a piece of him that's not the word of god he came the way the word said he was the word made flesh he was the one listen folks let me get let's see this man this is jesus he wrote what they're trying to live right you say oh no he's the second person no forget it they went but one god listen they even said that jesus they said you are the creator in other words this guy that was standing here not the flesh but this guy that was inside him they realized that was christ that all the way at the beginning of the of the world he was the creator but now caiphus didn't caiphus just thought he was some common ordinary guy and you know he says things different than what i say but now i'm the religion of the day i'm the guy you gotta listen to isn't that true and you know what they did they depended on caiaphas to put on the right robe they depended on confidence to wash the right animal they depended on compass to kill the right animal they depended on confidence to take that one vial of blood and go into the holy of holies which that's holy of holies is standing right there sprinkle the blood and atone for all of israel's sin and they depended on that man to do that am i strong enough and he walked out and he was the high priest couldn't touch him couldn't touch him yet here walks up a guy starts talking and he fulfills everything that they're saying over here everything he's the whole word remember he's not just part of it isaiah was part of it now this man is all of it right but yet what does catholics do when he walks up you're of a devil you're not just a part of a devil you got ev you're the head man you're like i'm the head priest you're the like i'm the headstone you're the headstone of demons now how can that be how can that be john 6 verse 53 then jesus said unto them who's them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh oh my goodness of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you now wait a minute the man of the hour standing here he said i ain't got to do any of that but this man over here saying unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you you know what he was saying confidence whatever you're doing is lifeless he said you have made your traditions in other words a stink in the nostril of god whoso eateth my flesh and drinking my blood he didn't just make a quote he's preaching here whosoever is my flesh and drink is my blood hath what eternal life how can that happen kaifa says and i will raise him up look at the power this man said he had if you got eternal life i'll raise you up for my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drinking indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him now how strange of a doctrine is that sounds real weird doesn't it kind of like when you first came in a message and weird doctrine sounded a little weird didn't they amen as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread now listen he's taking them all the way back to the children of israel and he's telling them who he was or who he is as the living father has sent me i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven and i'm sure catholics and him are going wait a minute that was a loaf of bread and it comes floating down and how in the world is it you well guess what he's the one who created it right that's why you can say this listen this man didn't have a bunch of history books to listen to or what or read jesus was the history book he was back in history that's what i'm saying listen let that thing out that's inside of you if you have the baptism of the holy ghost you were standing there when god said let there be light are you all okay i know you're about half asleep but this ought to excite you pretty much because you know what if you were back there you're going to be in the future home this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead and if you'll look up that word dead remember what brother mom said that was eternally separated from god he that eateth of this bread shall live forever forever now look these things he said is he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum now look jesus told him one day he said look this thing wasn't done in the corner i've been standing in this temple with you trying to get you to see who i am many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it when jesus knew it himself that his disciples murmured at it he said does this offend you sisters brothers does it offend you for somebody to preach and step on your toes every once in a while what if you shall see the son of man ascend up to where he was before now wait a minute hold on who are you saying you are i'm standing here yet i'm ascended yet i've come back see how confusing that that would be to a normal person though it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet is nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and their life why didn't just everybody why confidence just say all right if you're it i'm here because you know why it was them two spirits fighting each other that's right there was two spirits in there fighting each other just like the same way they fight now it is the spirit the question that the fast profit is nothing the word that i speak of to you they are what spirit and life but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who were they that believe not and who should betray him and he said therefore i said unto you that no man can come unto me except that we're giving unto him or my father from that time this is y'all know this is john 6 verse 66 right 666 the number of man oh john 6 66 says from that time many of his disciples what went back and walked no more with him couldn't take it couldn't take this new revelation couldn't take this new doctrine then jesus said unto the twelve will you go away will you also go away then simon peter answers it lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life amen that's what you guys decide today who's got the words of eternal life it's not wade dale samuel now it's the living word of god in all of us let's go to john 8 it gets worse john 8 39 look they answered and said unto him now who is they if you'll read it before it subscribes in the in the pharisees and the sadducees and i don't know if catholics was here at the time but it's kind of the hi guys they answered and said unto him i'm sure they took their little thanks abraham's our father jesus said if you were abraham's children in other words if you can read the bible like i'm reading the bible you'll know who i am if you were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham in other words abraham didn't go around trying to kill everybody that told him what was going on you do the deeds of your father then they said unto him we be not born of fornication in other words we knew we know where you came from you and that your mama you she didn't have no debt you had no daddy we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father you'd love me wow if god were your father you'd love me look folks this is what we're talking about now the two spirits are talking to each other for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why did you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word you can hear my what up you can hear my you can hear my verbiage you can hear the you know the the the sound you know the wave sound waves were in their ear but he said you're not listening to what i said because watch what he says ye of your father wow don't ever tell me that ye of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer he took him all the way back to cain he took him all the way back to genesis chapter 4. it said he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh the lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because i tell you the truth in other words you're doing the same thing you believe me not which of you convinces me of sin and if you say the truth why do you not believe me if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth god's word ye therefore hear them not because you are not of god boy that seal broke right there opened that thing up and he was telling them who he was but what did they do they rejected him they put him on a tree they killed him let's read this right here and then we'll close musicians get ready matthew 24 verse 7 for nations shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there shall be famines pestilence earthquakes and many places now this is the end time all these are the beginning of sorrows now this is on this is jesus preaching the seals but watch then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another luke 21 verse 15 for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all of your adversaries shall not be able to gain satan or resist thank you lord for this promise and you shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinfolk and friends and some of you shall be caused put to death and you shall be hated of all men wait a minute for my name's sake he said that before for my name's sake but there shall not a hair of your head perish john 16 verse 1. listen to this these things have i spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service when caiaphas put jesus on the cross he thought he was doing exactly what his his look at me his father was telling him to do and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me right not trying to scare you folks but i'm telling you the separation time is not going to be pretty it wasn't pretty back then and it's not going to be pretty now it's going to be and listen it ain't us against them it's the two spirits it's god fighting the battle and satan fighting the battle it's michael is still fighting for you and satan is still fighting against you now remember how does the battle get won whoever you yield to and get two to one on each side either side two to one on either side it's your decision to make whether you want to seek the truth or live under a truth there are people that have a truth right but there's not anybody that has the truth except the ones that can take this word of god and word by word put it together because satan can't do that and he hates it that's why he loves the denominational world because they've got it all different in different ways different they add this they take out that they add this they make a you bible they're making you know venia they're making you apostles creed they say this you've got to say this and you've got to do the little sign of the cross and all those things god's not in none of that god's in his word and just like i showed you the difference between the two there is a physical there's a spirit but now that spirit anoints physical people you got to remember it doesn't just float out in the air right it anoints physical people right satan was anointing catholics just like he anointed that beast in the end time i mean in the beginning and just like he'll anoint that beast in the end time just as a beginning he was speaking through catholics because look caiphus couldn't say couldn't look at the word of god and the word of god be in him and he'd look and say your bell's your bob that can't happen because jesus even said look he said how can satan cast out satan you see me cast these evil spirits out how can satan cast out satan unless his house be divided you know what that didn't bother them one bit they just kept right on going it's whoever was preaching somebody was preaching the the uh william the veil was rent from top to bottom and that thing's what's 60 feet tall than anything they had to know that was god that did that a man didn't crawl up there and cut the thing from top to bottom now see if it would have been rent from bottom to top they could have said somebody cut it and ripped it but it was rent from top to bottom god rent that thing god pulled it apart he said i'm done with this i'm not hitting anymore when i come back in three days i'll not be hit again i'm going to be what but i'm going to be inside of a group of people right and they're going to believe what i said they're going to be my children they're going to be led by the spirit of god they're going to be led to truth musicians come they're going to be led to the truth everybody that's born of god will be led to the truth no need to concern ourselves with world affairs but now remember like i said before that jesus didn't go crawl up in a cave and and stay there for 30 something years no he lived his life he worked in his daddy's carpenter shop he probably got splinters in his hand and he probably can make a real nice piece of furniture you understand what i'm saying but when his job come he didn't shy away at either he went straight into the synagogue he didn't he said i didn't do this in a corner i didn't do this in the shadow somewhere i did it right out here in plainview same way when the prophet of god come at the end time he said i didn't hide i came to every one of you denominations and you turned me down just like right just like your daddy denomination turned me down in the beginning because if that listen if christ is in you the hope of glory it's the same thing's going to happen right so so you say well the end of the seventh seal is just like there it is no if you'll remember the analogy brother brown said anybody ever shot oh wait a minute we're in jordan when we used to watch people shoot roman candles in another state because it was illegal in the state of georgia for a while but remember what a roman candle does though it's got like eight balls in it you fight you hit the you hit the uh ignition and they go up well what do those balls do they burst then they burst and then they keep bursting and if you if it was an eternal burst it would just be it started from one ball but it just kept bursting and bursting but that's what god did on the day of pentecost but that's what brother bradley was talking about the seventh seal he said it's like a rocket going off what is it it's a journey tomorrow you're gonna have a pop the next day you're gonna have a pipe revelation the next day you're gonna go thank you god thank you god thank you god for oh brother john you ought to know that whole company you work for it's working for you well did they move it 15 miles away they you moved it what 15 miles close to exactly where you live and they didn't ask you where you live did they they did you know what it was it was god god swooped down and said hey move that thing 15 miles closer and they didn't really say that you know what it was just an unction but then john walks in one day and he's got that big old smile on his face he's going man y'all know what y'all just did they said no you moved 15 miles closer to my work and you know what they probably just said oh well okay no that was god did that everything you got in your life let's stand our feet everything you do how many of you can testify all day long the things that god's done for you that it's not being controlled by the world amen because you know what you won't know how many other buildings they may have tried to choose how many times you tried to do something and you think oh man that door just shut but if you're a child of god you know who shut that door god shut the door because god got you 15 miles closer over here god didn't want them to go over here in this warehouse it was 30 miles away he wanted to go in this warehouse over here and you know what the warehouse was empty was it owned by the company yeah i'm not sure see there it may have just they may have just said well we own this building over here but i think we're going to buy that one why are we buying that one i don't know you told us to buy it so we bought it and god's going i told you to do it for my bride he takes care of his children he's not obligated to take care of nobody else but his own children now god's a good god he's a merciful god he's a gracious god but we don't believe in greasy grace either god's not going to just let you get by with anything in the world because you know what we still got to live by this this is our standard right here now other than that ask what you will you know what did you ask to be 15 miles closer you didn't even ask it did you but god knew if they run you 20 miles away you'd be going lord i wish i'd asked for it he just went ahead and gave it to you man what a mighty god we serve let's sing a song god bless you listen the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord are good footsteps of a good man look it up right of a good man is ordered to the lord so i believe every time we look at brother ryan all the different things that anybody's testimony look how god has just he shifts a whole company he shut down one sometime for somebody just shut the whole sister johnny sister johnny was living in new york and they were getting ready to shut the thing down where she was working so she just got a promotion and every time it was a promotion i think she got moved to a different position right they were going to close this whole division but they're set a bride they're set one of god's children that needed to work so she could get retirement so she could move back down here you don't think god don't work yeah god does every bit of that because they'd shut that thing down off that division right here and all of a sudden two weeks later their sister johnny popped up over here in this division over here of wherever she worked for a city bank or somewhere like that but she can tell you the story but how many times have you done that all through your life it's not been a chance i don't not believe in chance i do not believe in luck i believe in the providence of god and but the providence of god when he wrote this word right here it's already done can't change it's settled but you know what the bible says he knows what you're going to ask before you even ask him because you would have probably said lord why didn't you make that 15. he just said go and give him 15 miles closer i think that's wonderful i think that deserves a hand clown i think that deserves thank you god [Applause] that he's mindful even in this wicked world we live in he's still mindful and listen he's the only one that can change the mind of an owner of have you ever tried trying to change your mind though bob you ever trying to change the minds of them lawyers down there oh buddy it's not impossible with god though because all he's going to do is just change and and you can't even the devil can't do nothing about it but god changes the mind of people to fit me in you folks let me tell you something he loves us and like the scripture says there's not one hair on your head she'll perish you say well i'm losing my hair well no you're not you're going to have every bit of it because god said right here there shall not a hair of your head perish it's somewhere you'll get it back don't worry we come to the change we'll get it back some of you don't need it some of you do brother john let's say so god bless your heart now we've ended this and followed jesus oh take up your cross every day don't be afraid [Music] [Applause] [Music] just thank him today every day [Applause] [Music] every morning [Music] that carried that cross came back on the day of pentecost [Music] one more time follow jesus oh take up your calls every day [Music] take up your cross and follow him listen jesus didn't try to be strange but what he was made him strange amen he didn't try to act weird he acted what he was and it was weird to the world that's why we as believers in this end time the world thinks we're weird i mean really well why do you do this why the bible tells us to do it we're the only bible believing people in the face of the earth i don't care what anybody says i'll challenge anybody in the world we're the only full bible believing people on the face of the earth right now and if you don't believe that then you can't be bribed right because what's inside of you is what wrote this bible you can't deny can satan cast out satan can you deny the word if you've got the word inside of you you can't do that sure you can be confused and there can be things but ye listen the seventh seal is open so the book is an open book now the journey is is to go in there and eat that pizza or i mean uh going to eat that steak amen when that book was open that open from eternity to eternity we now know everything we need to know to get out of here it's already inside of you the problem is is we suppress it so much and we let this demon do this and we let this devil do that we let this situation do that we let this take away our joy and our happiness listen we're the bride of jesus christ amen and it's not my job or brother dale's job to protect you it's your father's job to protect you we just tell you what your father's already said about you we don't tell you no different strains doctor no we just say exactly what the father remember what my brother brown said he said what is the preacher's job to break the scale over the people's eyes that satan in other words has put over your eyes all during the week and give you doubts and give you fears and give you anxiety and give you this and give you that our job is is to get into the bible and say look this is what he's already said about you we win yeah wait a minute the bride will win amen right it might have looked real bad brother john it read the worst time if you were somebody standing looking at calvary and you what did all the what did all the guys do they left they run they scattered even when they resurrected peter went fishing i can't understand that but i can now peter didn't have a revelation really who that was right but boy on the day of pentecost though peter was his first guy he was the first guy to stand up and he said um i think i got some keys i need to use because that man gave me some keys and and now on the day of pentecost he's now inside of me so i think i'm going to use these keys he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and your children and to them that are afar off all the way into seven church ages here we are we've come up to the time they would love to be here how many times did did the prophet tell us that and jesus even said look he said those prophets desired to see your day well all those prophets even paul irenaeus all of them desired to be standing right here they wanted to see this right here come to fruition because they didn't see it in their day but they'll see it in this day when we meet them they're going to say how in the world did you make it through laodicea darkest time most demons most spiritual devils in the world paul said i saw it but i didn't know exactly what was going on but god sent us a prophet to turn the light on not make new light right come on now he didn't make new light he'd give us light on what's already been here in the bible amen you love the lord amen man please have a safe time be a pray for brother luis as he preached for us on wednesday and if the lord will take care of each and every one of us and bring us back wednesday at seven o'clock next sunday we'll have the same time brother terrence what we're doing anybody shifting for next week we're gonna try to do it all it looks like downstairs it's kind of working itself out so everybody can stay and eat we we've had plenty of room so far uh thanks to brother ryan and some of the ones that are that are um arbitrarily going out to eat and and giving leaving space for everybody to to have lunch and thank you for coming back second service i know it's hard but uh ain't nothing easy about this except believing that god is your daddy and if you're if god's your daddy then you're his children and he will take care of you no matter the devil can't touch mama don't mess with that kid that cub mama bear will kill you you mess with anything else but don't you get between that mama cup mama and her cubs so don't get between god and his children you're going to lose every time devil i hope you're hearing me you're going to lose every time it may look bad and very dark at the hour of calvary it may look real bad the sun went down and storms and all this stuff and people scattered and run and i'm sure they probably got in the corner and said oh this was the one remember i mean the road to emmaus they thought man this is the one have you not heard they they killed him and put him in a tomb and they were talking to the guy jesus had done turned back to a young man he done resurrected and he they were talking to the guy and he what did he do he said old fools and slow heart took him back the bible says into the book of isaiah and walked them right through i bet you right to the time where he was standing right there and they said come on in and stuck with us we want you to stay let's have jesus come and stuff with us today let's bow our heads the heavenly father we thank you for this day that you give us we pray that lord what we've said be pleasing to your ears we pray that it'll go into the hearts of the believers lord we'll realize that we're your children and you said you'd take care of us lord in the darkest hour that we go through lord we can look up and say father forgive us father hold us in your hands father cover us by your wings father put us in your pavilion lord where we can be safe lord the whole world's raging over different things one thing and another all the viruses and all the things going on but lord you said you'd have a bride there to make it through so this is not coming to an end as the world would say come to an end this is just the beginning of what you're i believe you're going to show the whole world just for a moment that you've got a group of people on the earth that believes you i pray that you bring us to that lord make us help us to be faithful to you forgive us of our sins and be with us on the highway as we go home be with the ones lord that are sick today the ones that couldn't get here be with brother darrell's family lord as they're putting him to rest lord we appreciate seeing him now we'll know another one for us to to see lord when they come back father we we're just happy for that but sad that we're not gonna get to see him on this side but glorious to know that he's standing in in that sixth dimension lord in a glorified condition waiting on us to bring him back here lord thank you for all the things you give us revelation lord not to puff us up and make us think we're somebody special but lord you made us special if we hide in your pavilion if we become your children you make us special lord because you're as david the apple of your eye lord we thank you for all things bless our pastor keep him safe lord be with each other louise on the way home lord this long trip there from ohio will be taken tomorrow just be with him and bless him lord in jesus name we ask these things
