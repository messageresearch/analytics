here to hear from you father so move this vessel out of the way father and you take over and you do the speaking and father you be the active participant in this service so thank thank you for all things we ask your blessings in Jesus name amen let's go to Revelations 1:10 Bible says I was in the spirit y'all can see that in the back I hope I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last did y'all see that post where the U all the U prior uh Eclipse that went across America it makes those two signs the Alpha sign and the Omega sign in the heaven God's fixing to do something he's bringing this Omega bride to view one more time as brother Brown saw that in the vision one more time he's bringing that Omega bride into view so that the world can see that God's in control and where he is they're all looking for him to come you hear the songs of you know we want you to come Lord we want you to come he's not going to come the way they talking that's right he's hearing his bride he's already here visible on the earth in a in a people but that's hard for them to believe just like it was hard for them to believe Jesus was almighty God Amen but I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra and andaris in Philadelphia and leosa and I turned to see the voice that spake to me and what do he see he turned he saw seven candlesticks so he saw he he thought he was going to see Jesus standing there he saw a scene all right and he saw someone standing in that scene he knew who Jesus was he'd seen him all of his life you most of his life but he saw him in a form he'd never seen him before he saw him in the form of the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and GED about to paps with a golden girdle we know that's in Bride form all right so now Revelations 1:16 and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth one a sharp two edged sword you may be seated the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of his word we're going to get into the pergan church age today but I was thinking yesterday all the all that's being preached about stars and we talk about our messenger and how the star led us to Christ you know you're part of that star you know you're part of that star you're you're not the star there's seven stars seven men Messengers but you're a part of that star we are a part of that and recipient of that seventh Church age messenger his message is now living in the hearts of a group of people called a bride yes all right that's me and you so we ought to praise God for that every day we we we don't have to make oursel odd we already are odd we don't have to make oursel special we already are special God chose us to be in this age he chose us to wind this thing up yes sir so God's going to have a group that's going to wind this thing up cuz remember I didn't know if I told you or not but God Don't Make Mistakes amen he knows what he's doing and he put the right people just like we said before with with um irenius God put irenius in the position he was supposed to be in at the time he was supposed to be in amen for the people that was there to respond to what he had said listen there's no reason to have a messenger without somebody to respond to it because many times The Messengers we saw many times before The Messengers already gone off the scene about the middle of the church age the church age is really just getting going God takes his Messenger off the scene God does takes the messenger off the scene God did that he knows what he's doing if he left that Messenger on that scene so long the people would continue to look to that person look to that person look to that person he wants us to look to Christ and Christ CHR alone so let's read Revelations 2:12 to the angel of the church in pergamus write these things sayith he that ha the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where thy dwellest now I want you to watch we'll background a little bit with Smyrna but pergamus this age keep in your mind this is the third age all right everybody with me the third age one 23 the third The Three Ages and the first first one second one Paul irenius and Mark coming up those three Ages were the lion age l i o n where the lion of the tribe of Judah they spoke bold but all of a sudden their speaking bold is going to turn and they're going to speak through a pope Satan's going to be so much in there I want you to watch how many times this scripture tells us about Satan all right I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is all right remember as we were talked before that it wasn't in the synagogue that they were the synagogue of Satan all right and thou hold as fast my name this is the last age that the Lord Jesus Christ baptism is prevalent last age from then on till just this day right now we're looking at it was titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost because remember during this time and we'll look at in a minute the Nan Council started 3:25 ad so that's about the time in this church age all right so what man started doing was was eroding the word of God all right said thou holdest fast my name there was a little group that held fast and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast them that hold the doctrine watch the doctrine of balum then you're going to see in just a minute it's the doctrine of the nicians it's become a Doctrine it's not been a saying it's not been a deed it's become a Doctrine in other words when you have a Doctrine it's incarnate brother bram's Doctrine was to restore us back to the faith of the fathers that was his Doctrine and then to bring his message to an end time bride to take us out of here all right so he had that message and he had a Doctrine brother BR said a church without a Doctrine is what not a church okay so he because thou Hast them that hold the doctrine of balam who taught Bao to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel the Bao or balum of that time we know was Constantine Constantine comes up about the end of this age and brings it into where he brings church and state together all right brother Brown calls it and we look pergamus means to be or perian means to be thoroughly married you would think that we would be the ones that would be thoroughly married we are now they weren't then it wasn't their job to be thoroughly married it's our job to be the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ with everything in order everything the right way no father son Holy Ghost baptism no eternal hell and all those doctrines that came into this doctrine of balum and what did it do it cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel are the bride of that age amen stumbling block didn't kill them it stumbled them to eat things sacrificed un idols and commit fornication so Hast look so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nickolath which things I hate and for all of y'all that's sitting here today God what God hates there's things he hates he hates that he hates the doctrine of balam he hates the doctrine of the nicians so if we're attack anything attached to that God's got to hate it now watch he said repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with a sword of my mouth he's admonishing him if it don't get back to the word he's going to absolutely take the word and pretty much fight the whole time and that's what happened in that middle Church age the fourth Church age which was Darkness all right are the Dark Age he that ha to near let him hear what the spirit saith into the churches now look there is an overcoming group remember whatever they have to overcome we have to overcome that's why these Church ages are so important that's why I really went back and was reading on the life of irenius we see the life of Paul it's in the Bible but irenius thank God he's put somebody in there that would take down the acts of irenius and the acts of Martin and all the different ones so that a prophet in the end time could tell us that's the star right he fits the characteristics of all these others cuz you had polycarp you had anus and if you'll look up the anpus you hardly find anything about him at all brother brandham said in the church a book he couldn't find anything about him at all but he must have been a prophet he was a faithful martyr and he was doing he was in the Bible my faithful servant that's why sometimes we think we can't find oursel in the Bible and we're totally insignificant we don't go you're there you're there you're in Bible you're living the Bible you are the Bible yes sir you got to believe that Amen to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Mana Now where's the hidden Mana didn't fall out in the outer Court wasn't in the inner Court H the hidden Mana was in the holy of holies so he's telling this group of people I will have a group of people I will hide myself and feed AB I'll hide them and feed them cuz I'm going to have a church that comes from this evil pergam Church age yes sir right and I will give him a white stone and that white stone a new name for those of y'all that are new there's been a Doctrine about that for years and years and years and years that brother rownan was supposed to come back and give us that name amen well let's just read the Bible can we just read the Bible that's right can can we just read that scripture that says I will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no read that with me no one knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen so it's to you somebody don't have to tell you you'll know that name whatever it is that's right you'll know what it is yes sir God didn't say wait on the prophet he'll tell you what your name is lazy people wait on things I know you already put the scripture in their mind they that wait upon the Lord there's a difference in that waiting is not going and sitting somewhere in the corner that's right that sign that says right up there be still and know that I am God that's exactly right inside here yes but we got work to do remember brother R said God's waiting on us not but us waiting on him that's right we're not waiting on him to carry this thing on he is waiting on us to get off and on get off our rear and get on with the message that's what we're talking about here there's nothing impossible to those that'll try just try which no man knoweth save he that receiveth this receiveth it now remember the characteristics there's an announcement in heaven out of the mind of God goes the logos it's a sealed up message that no one else gets except one messenger that saves the confusion amen but then when that messenger receives that then that becomes the mind of God in an individual and what he says is the truth cuz it come from the mind of God God articulated this whole thing but he had to wait until somebody like Paul got knocked off his high horse on Hell on somebody so he could use him yes so that mystery is then spoken to the star he picks it up and says that ain't nothing but the truth but they have to stand alone remember brother R had to stand alone Paul had to stand alone Paul said I got this from no man wow listen brother R didn't get this from no man he took things that he could read and he put things together Clarence Lin the different ones but the Holy Spirit gave him a message to give to me and you he was the church age Messengers all those other ones they had truth they had truth the Lans and the different ones they had truth but they weren't Messengers to the Church of leosa they didn't have a prophecy behind them as of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 and the different things and I tell you once we move through these Church ages when we get to that last Church age we're going to try to stop just a little bit and we're going to talk about brother brandham and what his message is and how it unfolded and why it was him cuz he's got to meet the characteristics the same as Paul right if he's a star he's got to meet that same characteristic well Mysteries unfolded to the star of the age matching pieces so a trumpet sounds in other words he begins to declare a message then a church age begins and it's a distinct and declared message it's something to me and you like brother briam said he said this is not to the world even on marriage and divorce he brings it down even closer he said this is to my followers only not Methodist Baptist Pentecostal he said to my followers only that believe in other words my message this is to you that's real narrow and thank God for grace that a prophet had to give he had to give one in several different ages so God knew we' need it yes but it starts a spiritual war the true word of God versus the false doctrines and we see it now we've seen it before we seen it when brother Brown went off the scene who's going to be this who's going to be that but that messenger's laid away or taken off the Earth but the people accepted or rejected there was a group of people there's a group of people sitting here today that's going to accept the message and go on or reject it and go somewhere else you cannot stay new neutal folks that's why you see people leaving the message that's why you see people leaving church you can't sit in a congregation with the word being preached and God convict you and if you don't take that conviction and bring it before God you will have to leave brother R said Anan and Safara which means oh I pay my tith sometimes brother I I pay it when I can that's the same thing they asked ananas he said oh I've give all I've give everything I got Peter said you lied you didn't lie to me you didn't lie to the church you lied to the Holy Ghost all right don't mean to scare you but we need to pay our tithe it's pretty simple brother Brown said only Christians will pay tithe right I can't believe some people don't know don't know that catch up Revelation but anyway but there's always true and false but you won't be able to sit in this congregation as we continue on and I'll give you a piece of what I want to talk about this afternoon listen we've come to a place to where we've had we've had the former Reign we've had the teaching rain brother Dale brought the teaching rain brought it to us pure and unadulterated all right well God saw to leave him there because he had a work to do all right but now he's not stopping the door didn't shut and listen it's not all a on me you got work to do we got to start living what the man taught yes sir listen folks the days of Plenty is over we had those times as brother Brandon was talking about that Israel enjoyed their Millennium during Solomon's time they enjoyed wealth amen they enjoyed Fortune they enjoyed power being a powerful group of Israel amen but there was a time come when all that went away they went into captivity what you saying brother way well you know the times of us spending a whole lot of money probably over it's going to get worse folks then it gets better it's going to get worse out here Cosmos World Order is going to get worse look at Iran they're throwing missiles at Israel brother Brown said watch Russy but he also said if you want to know what time it is he said you watch Israel Israel the guy stood up this morning I was watching him online from the mad he stood up and he said he looked right at the Cameron and he said Iran don't know what kind of mistake they just made so Israel was ready for it we had already our intelligence forces 3 weeks ago had proclaimed that Iran was going to shoot missiles at them and that guy said look out Iran we're already in your country we're already in your country they wasn't waiting on them to fire Rockets that's what God's people do they act they don't wait on the devil they said we're God's people yes God give us this intelligence no one is going to stand before us on he said we're all ready in your country Iran he said get ready wow a little piece of ground not much bigger than from where brother Ben from Connecticut maybe not even Rhode Island it's not that big that little piece of ground has been fought it has been destroyed 17 times in history up until the modern ages but that guy looked at the camera and he said you know they tried to kill us and I think it was was 30 something uh they tried to annihilate Us in 45 you know with the Holocaust he said they tried in 47 he said they tried in 67 he said they tried in 83 he said we're still Israel amen amen God protect Israel but there'll be a day come though that this country and I'm not prophesying brother R's already told this you watch and see when we turn Israel down when we quit we go to say all right now you need to stop that Iran we'll give you some more stuff that's the day that we'll get our judgment it'll begin that day because the Bible tells us whoever is a friend of Israel is a friend of God whoever is an enemy of Israel is an enemy of God that's right that's why they don't care Iran's 50 times bigger than the than the state of Israel Israel and the mount just about that big Iran's about that big launch them missiles and I think one or two hit the ground out somewhere and didn't even hit anything that Iron Dome killed every all those other missiles that they were see just telling you judgment he coming amen exactly and when we turn God down as a nation and they'll start ripping us up that's right that's when the persecution will come that's why I said the times of Plenty is probably over the times of survival is upon us but we're built for it yes Israel was built for it they made it they went in the promised land a lot of them didn't but the ones that were supposed to did so spiritual death comes on those who reject their messenger so the next days come same thing happens there's an announcement so now we see that the announcement has went to irenius irenius has lived his life he has passed away we'll look at it just a second he's he's moved on passed away he's laid away but the message continued on but that message began began to get pulled apart well God's not that wasn't that wasn't God uh that was uh a created substance from god named Jesus that's what it's coming to in 325 ad they didn't make that happen in 3:25 they waited a little bit later and then they made it happen amen all right so out of the mind of God comes the L go a sealed up message open so the mystery now is getting ready to come to a man named St Martin so remember the age of Pentecost the messenger was the Holy Ghost the alpha age was the Ephesian Church age get this thing to moving so now remember Paul died 64 to 67 the fesan age ended at 170 so now we come into a new age which would be bear with me all right we see there the messenger comes Paul comes irenius comes and now what's going to happen there's another Porter or another messenger getting ready to step in that overlap and his name is St Martin and we'll look and see what St Martin did here in just a second all right and they always coming to lap over now watch also brother rown said look every evil that was in the first church age lapped over into the next one just keeps going on down till it ends up in complete apostasy in this day right here now remember he knew where the seat of Satan was he knew who the synagogue of Satan was he knew the Deeds of the nicians he knew the doctrine of the nicians god knew that but it's all piled up in the end time now it's all come down here where Satan's trying to conquer the leoty he's trying to give a Doctrine to Bam what which made aop uming block for the people there's true Bride come on Church remember remember though remember the vision brother randam had that last bride did stumble hello that last bride got out of Step just a little bit and the prophet had to say remember he woke up saying get back in line well that's us we need to get back in line to fulfill this prophecy amen cuz we are coming into complete apostasy right now Satan will be in his seat he will be in his Tabernacle he will be in his synagogue right about the time we get ready to get out of here he's going to Incarnate a pope which he's never done before he's used them he's anointed them but now he's going to become it everybody with me listen so Hallelujah we might have been like God we might have had these do is over here but there's going to be a church yes sir right now today that is God on the earth that will be Mrs Jesus Christ that will not be that's right fooled that's right by Doctrine contrary to the word of God so the lap over is a grace to the people and we'll look at that more when we get to the last Church age because remember after the last Church age there is no lap over right it abruptly stops Gentile churches done uh brother Tim and I were talking the other day uh we're all everybody's looking for that last one right you know we make that quote we're looking for the last seed we're looking for the last one to come in now let's go to I think the adoption Series where brother Ram said he said when the door of the Gentile Church closes that means the last one comes in he said God will anoint a church then he said in one year God will do more than theologist did in 2000 one year after the doors closed if we believe brother Brown was a prophet the listen what I'm saying is when the last one comes in if we say oh that's that's you know brother Michael and when boom when he gets born again we're just going to disappear that's not going to happen amen we may be here another year but the power of God will be so much in the bride till the world will one see us one time we'll be on display one time to the world you can either be part of it or you can be part of the world that's your choice so the samna church age we know what samna was was what bitter M death comes from the word merish used it in bombing the dead so will what brother Brown says look thus we have a two-fold significance found in the name of the age it was a bitter age filled with death the two Vines within the framework of the church listen Paul knew those Vines were growing already in the first church age Grievous wolves he called him would come among the group listen Satan always wants to be where the word is yes sir right that's why he's not bothering the world he's already got them if they're not born again he's after me and you to try to get us to slip up one little bit yes like brother Bob said quit coming to church and quit doing the things you're supposed to do brother BR said how can I teach them Doctrine if they don't do their ABCs right we wonder why we have problems like I said before a few Sundays ago check yourself up I do believe in checklist I like them cuz it keeps you checked up but are you checking all the boxes come to church every time doors open pay my ti read my Bible pray for the pastor pray for the deacons pray for everybody pray for the sick are we still checking off have we missed one bar have we missed a box somewhere if we have you need to go back to that box I didn't tell you that God did Brother Brown said how can I teach them Doctrine if they don't know their ABCs amen people struggle dad's always said he said I don't need a list to tell me who pays TI and who don't he said I watch and see people that struggle don't pay their TI we love to quote brother Dale till we quote that and it goes we love to quote the Bible until it goes full frontal nothing in the back but that's the truth people it's the truth without god without doing what he said you'll struggle we going to struggle enough if we check all the boxes you going to struggle enough you check them all off but Satan can get in one box he'll get in it and what does he do when he gets in it he don't just sit there he's a Vine he's going to grow and make you worse brother Brown said take the joy right out of you am wow well have to fix that that's annoying so the two Vines within the framework of the church were drifting further apart with an increased bitterness toward the True Vine on part of the false death was not only the seed of the false Vine but even in the True Vine there was a creeping paralysis listen to this a creeping par this is the true vine a creeping paralysis and impotence because they had already drifted from the unadulterated truth of the first few years after Pentecost this is the second age amen now watch and no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of and adherence to the pure word of God that's what I said before check all the boxes the word of God tells us to do something if we don't do it and we know to do it and don't do it that's why the Bible says in the end time iniquity will abound what's iniquity it's right in front of your face you know not to do that but you run that stop sign anyway okay as seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament organization was growing a pace confirming and augmenting the death of the membership for Holy Ghost leadership was deposed and the Word was replaced by Creeds dogmas man-made rituals this is just as we're still in the second Church age all right when Israel went into C ity they had a priesthood a temple in the word when they came out they had rabbis theological order Pharisees synagogue and the town mood and Jesus called them you're of your father the devil that church age started around 170 to ad80 312 the messenger was irenius he was born in 130 ad he died in 202 so he died about in the middle of the church age so somebody picked his message up he was a mess he was a student of John the Revelator so was I mean polycarp but he wasn't militant against the nickel system for he himself leaned toward organization he's talking about polycarp but with irenius this was not so he was militant against any form of organization we're going to see Martin the same way listen God knows how to choose a man I don't know if y'all know that or not but God don't make a mistake okay so when he come to Martin Martin just fit the mold because Martin was a soldier right Martin was in the Army for years until he had an experience so he was melant already he was already against things that were evil so he just brought it on and God just anointed that part and just brought it right on in right he had much manifestations we're still talking about irenius now he taught it with unusual Clarity and Conformity to his original precept his church in France was known to have gifts of the Spirit Saints spoke in tongues prophesied raised the dead healed the sick he saw the danger of any kind of organized Brotherhood among the elders pastors Etc he stood solidly for a unified spirit filled gift manifesting local church and God honored him for the power of God manifestation or manifested among the saints so he was clearly the man for the hour brother Brown said look it is altogether unfortunate that the other ages didn't not having in their Messengers such a balance of fruit power and leadership in the Holy Spirit and the word irus said the glory of God is Man Fully Alive he had a real good understanding of one true Living God Jesus the Incarnate Word is a meeting place between God in humanity he wrote the book against heresies which was against the gnostics the gnostics said it was many gods or two gods or three Gods he was a disciple of poar who was a disciple of John the Revelator he set the four gospels as the cannon of scripture there's other things he did in his life but the central point of irenius is theology is the unity and goodness of God he knew there was one true and living God he did not stand for a trinity he did not stand for two gods or one like substance of God as santhus was uh started that um Doctrine amen so in opposition to the gnostics and they just have all kind of gods whatever so irus used the word logos he inherited from Justin Martyr irenius was a student of polycart as we said before and they use that word logos so until the angel of the church in sna WR these things sayth the first in the last which is dead and is alive now that's unusual cuz we're alive and then we die but this man died so that you could live he's talking about Jesus Christ then watch he knows the works of the people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he said I Know Thy works and thy tribulation I know that but I'm not going to stop it because you need it same way with us it's Church tribulation brother Ram look we'll read it in just a minute no he does not what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffered you cannot figure out God's love they thought that love meant no s suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was what proven truly by the fact that they were chosen under salvation because God chooses you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit believe in the truth he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job this is his prerogative but remember he's Sovereign but it all happens for a purpose God can't take his children and turn them into the devil he takes the devil's kids praise God and turns him into his kids amen that's his election he knows there's going to be a group of people he know knows what we need he knows Lula Church what we need to carry on through the next days weeks months years and ever how long till the Rapture of the church he knows that yes sir and he has a purpose in doing it yes sir if he did not have a purpose he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect established strengthen and settled remember Jesus was the same way why does he stand by here's the reason and if we're children then HS HS of God now we're if we're going to be join HS if so be that we white suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us if we take this little part of life that we live every how many years you've lived and and and every how many years we're going to live until the Rapture comes or we pass it's just a small amount of time a and it is it's an effort I know it's an effort to come to church cuz I do it like sister Junior say she know it's an effort for you sisters to oh you know it'd be just I guess let me just tell you this it would be wonderful to just if my hair if you know if you got all this hair going this way just cut it off that's what we do we got hair standing up we trim it off cuz it's not an example that you sisters are in scripture you're an example of Purity and obedience and obedience to what the Bible says so it's a joy if you get up in the morning and you have to put your long hair up and you're saying words you shouldn't say you need a new birth right amen don't ever complain about your hair if you complain about your hair then you need a new birth right oh I know some say it's falling out and it is all you can't help that but you can help putting the scissors in your hand and you know what that the glory that's going to be revealed in US is that God's going to turn one day and say look they did it they did it I wrote it they did it what's your problem that's where God is a judge but he's a righteous judge unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reain the reason for this is the character simply never is never made without suffering character is of what victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is what satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share his throne on the same basis he overcome and sit down on the father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him there's a lot of obstacles that you overcome every day to be a Christian even little ones like today you know you got people today and not here but you got people that are just people out in the world to Sunday's a day they go party they'll go to the to the to the lake they'll go to the picnic they'll go to to the Ball Game they'll go and and they'll stay home and they'll make their house look so pretty that's right pretty house that one ain't going to be in heaven right was talking to somebody the other day and can't remember who it was but all these fineries that we have ain't going to be over there all these fineries it's good to keep your house clean it's good for all this stuff but what are you building you building something for here is this more important than what's what there think about that is this more important everything here I got to build this thing here if it consumes us if we like I said before if we have to stay out of church on Sunday to do something that you purposely wait till Sunday to do you're lost you're lost period you're lost this day is a sacred Day to a Christian amen people will wait till Sunday to do something and they'll call you and say well I got to do this on Sunday we got to overcome what do we have to overcome the urge to do something else the urge to go do something else cuz we're sitting in a hot building you're listening to a boring preacher and you you're wanting it to be finish so you can go eat and they're out there having fun they got their Budweiser their Bud Light and out there on the late and they got their cooler Donnie you did it go out there get cooler and get out on the boat he's going like this get out on the boat and just oh God I'm enjoying life a little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory look that be will be revealed in US yes cuz he's coming back for us he's not coming back for the world the world will never see him until the day of judgment praise God you and I'll have three and a half years of wedding supper with him eye to eye face to face then we'll have a millennium where we'll walk with him and talk with him and be Eternal and not have to worry about Monday yes sir that's this little temporary suffering if they did it in those ages you and I can do it in this age if you get the urge to do something contrary to the word of God what brother say to do don't go get in your closet and try to do you know look at the and find brother Brand's picture what'd he say he said do the opposite amen if you don't feel like going to church try going to church sometime can I have an amen brother Bob did but the rest of you I don't know some of these mumbles but try come to church try try to overcome what you're what you're going through try to overcome it that's right I'm not throw I'm not saying anything to build you up but she should be home sitting in a chair she has a torn ligament or some kind of muscle in her leg and she's sitting there a few minutes ago and every once in a while they'll Tien up so bad she'll start crying she's sitting here right she's overcome God has to listen God has to do what his word says he has to come to that and honor it somehow that's overcoming oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing look willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you now he's reading Bible that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir is it it's not strange we will have trials we are all tried and chastened his sons not one but goes through that listen this is quote I coming to brother R said the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of [Music] God brother Bob he was talking about brother Ron Spencer praying at that prayer line do you know he went home Monday and had a heart attack had to take him to the hospital he had 100% blockage in one 90% in another and the Widowmaker the one that takes you out 70% blocked they took him to UVA all his cancer team came there actually they came to the hospital I was talking to um uh brother Nate green stopped by he's pre for brother brother Dutch Scott today but uh the whole team from UVA University of Virginia hospital come down and got him and the people at this little hospital I mean they did all they could do you can only do so much they said we can do the we fix the 100 but we can't touch the 70 or the 30 because we you won't make it through it so he calls you be 18 you be 18 praise God for them group of people they comes they come down there and pick him up took him an hour to UVA they fixed all three all three of them and he's home now but you're talking about I mean that's what he did that prayer line with and taken listen he takes 30 cancer pills a day a day they're only he said they're only keeping that cancer at bay that's all they're doing but praise God for two years years it hadn't moved one bit it hasn't grown it hasn't and that didn't mciz to his brain and then remember it went in his eyes you remember that now he's healed to that he's a true job that's for sure but yeah when you said that the other day I didn't know it but then uh brother Nate came said you know brother Ron had a heart attack I said no he said had it Monday when he left when he come back from Louisiana Camp so he had that fiery two-hour prayer line with 100% blocked artery 90% blocked artery and a 70% blocked Widowmaker if you don't know what that Widowmaker is that's why it's called a Widowmaker cuz it will make you if you married a widow 70% blocked but thank God he had a team they come and got him took him up to UVA they took care every bit of that so he's a living testimony but but listen through suffering through suffering he has become just a Beacon of Faith through suffering that man takes 30 cancer pills a day sometimes he throws up all the time he throws up before he preaches right and we got problems we can't get to church cuz for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement where of all are partakers then are you bastards and not Sons get quiet now this special condition in Smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there's no True Believer free from it this is of god this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it love suffereth long and is kind right so now let's look at the word look at pergamus that was the the um we got the Ephesian age sman age now we're going into pergamus all right the pergamus means thoroughly married so what's going to happen is whatever we're sayings and deeds in these first two Church ages they're going to become doctrines so that it's preached now freely in churches everybody with me it's preached freely in churches now today it's preached freely churches doctrine of balum amen and the doctrine of nians is being preached all over the world right now but it had its seed or its rep its part of beginning right here in pergamus so let's read Revelations 212 to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things saith he that has sharp sword with two edges what's the what's the sword sword's the word all right has two edges Cut's going in Cut's coming out I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seed is and thou holdest fast my name and Hast not denied my faith even in those days where in Antipas my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth he probably got in somebody's business and they killed him and it probably wasn't a drunk it was probably somebody goes to church hello somebody but I have a few things against thee because thou Hast there them that hold the doctrine of balum who taught bailo to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed into idols and commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicians which thing I hate God can't change his mind amen all right can't change his mind if he hated it in a baby form he hated it in his form yes repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with a sword of my mouth listen when God starts a battle he always wins I don't want him to start a battle against me right he going to win somewhere he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and we give him a white stone and that stone a new name which no one knoweth save he that receives it so just hang on if you get a new name I'm not going to be able to tell it to you you're going to have to get it for yourself and that what that says not a prophet's got to come back and tell me what my new name is I think he already called us bride he already called us Christian he already called us M Jesus Christ we've had a wedding when you have a wedding you have a name change right here not there right here so this age lasted from 312 to 606 and then remember there was a council of n in 325 ad so it happened kind of right at the beginning of this the messenger was St Martin he lived from 3:15 to 399 and all of you remember that when he was a soldier he gave his coat to a beggar he couldn't give it all to him so he cut it and give half of it to a beggar we all know that and then the Lord Jesus came that night and presented himself to St Martin and he had half of the coat on so he knew that Jesus was there and there was symbol but he was showing Martin that hey what you've done to my little ones you've done it unto me well he was converted then he went to see a person that was had some kind of Authority and he went to see him in court well guess what the court wouldn't see him mayor's busy you get that in a minute the mayor's busy right so Mark says I need to see him say he's busy so about that time the mayor got a hot seat God sent a fireball down and set his rear end on fire and the seat he was set setting in and he actually saw Martin after that at least he had a little bit of sense then remember that one time that he was talking to that group that was against him and he says okay if God be for us let's stand right here tie me to a tree that's that's on a slope this way tie me underneath it and he said if God kills me then you know whatever take it it's yours you know what happened they chopped that tree down and when it did and not only turned up the hill it killed the ones that cut the tree down up this way not that way up this way so what a powerful man and he also there's a um uh there's a relic that that I was looking online it's pretty interesting and it's a hatchet because Martin was known to cut down Idols any kind of worship trees Idols altars he had an ax about this big and it had a great big head on the end of it and that was known as St Martin's acts and he would go and tear everything apart how militant is that he said I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is but you hold as fast my name like I said before this is the last Church age that the name of the Lord Jesus will ever be used in baptism in a in a in the form like you understand um accepted practice until now right it'll always always be father son Holy Ghost after that and they'll do away with the name but there's a group that holdeth fast my name and hasth not denied my faith even in those days were antibus my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth but I have a few things against the because there is them that hold the doctrine of balam who taught balock to cast a stumbly block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nians which things I hate I wrote myself a note there's two things two doctrines God hates he hates the BAM doctrine of balum and he hates the doctrine of the nicians amen he said repent or else I will come unto you quickly and will fight against you with the sword of my mouth listen to brother randman real quick we'll be done right here thus by the time of this third Church age we have two churches bearing the same name now look bearing the same name but one with a bitter difference between them one has departed from the truth married idols and has no life in her does that sound familiar it's happening today they have no life if they don't have the name of the Lord Jesus amen right she has hybridized herself and the signs of death not life follow in her wake she is powerful many members favored by the world the other is a little persecuted group but she follows the word and signs follow her the sick are healed the dead are raised she's alive with life in the word of God she loves not her life but holds to his name and his faith even unto death and so the terrible persecution of official Rome fell upon the True Believers until Constantine now watch watch how watch how slick the devil is just for a second before we close let how slick this guy is now what does con do Constantine comes up and brings church and state together he sees all this property he's got all this money he puts them both together and makes synagogues and all these different things he sends people out on crusades right seems to be the nice guy that brought all that together that was the devil amen but watch how the devil Works Rome was persecuting the believer am everybody with me now watch this was so astounding Rome say Rome was the devil the devil is persecuting True Believers until Constantine Constantine sees that he arose and granted freedom of religious worship seems like a nice guy but there seems to be two reasons why this Freedom was granted in the first place various good Emperors had not allowed persecution but as they passed on they were followed by those who killed Christians it was so senseless that it finally came to a public head that the Christians ought to be left alone that's the devil saying that the second and best noted reason is that Constantine had a very difficult battle ahead of him we know the story of that and taking over the control of the Empire One Night in a dream he saw a white cross it's why they called him crossbags he thought he was doing it for God he was putting it together for the devil brother rown called that the Dark Ages when church and state married Ahab and Jezebel married was in the Old Testament and this was where Jezebel and Ahab married in our time but I want you to watch what he says one night in a dream he saw white crosses appear before him he felt that this was an omen unto him that if the Christians prayed for a victory for him he would win the battle he promised freedom for them in the event he was Victorious he was Victorious and the freedom of worship was granted in the Edict of NES 312 ad but but this freedom from persecution to death was not as monogamous as it first appeared Constantine was now the patron as a patron his interest was somewhat more than that of an observer for he decided that the church needed his help God don't need help he had seen them disagreeing over various matters one of them which involved Aras Bishop of Alexander who taught his adherence that Jesus was not truly God now watch but a Lesser God having been created by God kind of the way it is today the western church held the opposite view believing that Jesus was the very essence of God as they said coequal with the father with such matters along with the intrusion of pagan ceremony into worship the end the emperor called for the Nan Council in 3:25 ad with the thought that he would bring all the groups together where they could iron out their differences and come to a common understanding let's just all get together and all and all be one isn't it peculiar that though they started with Constantine it didn't die but it's very much alive today that was the seed for the World Council of churches which is going to head up and that's the one that's going to persecute the bride amen the World Council of churches started back there with Constantine bringing church and state together making them powerful giving them land giving them authority to do things letting them worship the way they want to until Constantine come to a place to where remember he said in other words my Christianity is the one you got to deal you got to you got to come to if you don't come to my Christianity we're going to kill you so you see now we're heading into the Dark Ages we 68 million Christians that's the next age we're getting into 68 million Christian million 68 million Christians that's about the population of of California and a couple other states 68 million people were killed because they said they were Christians but not the kind of Christian Constantine wanted them to be wow and where he failed to truly achieve it it will be achieved in this day through the ecumenical move amen folks we're at the end time right there that thing that happened in 325 ad read about it really what happened in 325 ad they didn't come to any conclusion like Constantine wanted them to that's why he started persecuting them then in 606 ad is when they really come up with all this and said all right this is law you're baptizing this way this is what it's going to be we have Apostles Creed we have all this this 'll be a pope now and you'll listen to this Pope that's how it all got started well guess what that's what's going to happen right now we got religious freedom stand let's stand our feet we got religious freedom when we came here in America right we got religious freedom but what was it though it's the birthplace of where the World Council of churches is going to head up right here in this nation but it started out true but somewhere it turned false listen let's don't let our life do that let's don't let our life start out true and and we started out because how many many times we see that that God says I have somewhat against you because you've left something I have somewhat against you I love you you take my name some of you still hold my name some of you still do the things that I want you to do but there's a group of you that I have somewhat against we pray that we're not in that group checking up time for all of you yes sir for all of us we're heading into a new era okay we're heading into not a new way but we're heading into something that we might have not have thought 5 years ago we' ever come this way everybody with me this is the fact we're standing here alive and the way we deal with it is going to determine our future everybody with me all right and to to you sisters I again I apologize but I'd like to just speak to the men first and um you're very important you're extremely important you're the to you're the you're the backbone you're the remember you're the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John and the mom that's what brother rown said all right that's what you are and we appreciate you and we love you but there are certain things that we need to discuss that that sometime emotion gets involved and sometimes you know a lot of things get involved that that sisters can't handle now I'm not I'm going to tell you what brother rown said that y'all are more conf thousand more times confused than we are or can be right boy you don't get many amens out of that but it's in print it's in print he said it all right I'm listen why you getting mad at me I'm just telling you what brother random said thousand times more confused all right well let's just keep it that all the confusion out and I know some of you are just absolutely in the word of God lighthouses Stellar you get behind your husband though cuz remember remember this one thing we still believe brother R was a prophet right brother Ram said you sisters will never give an account of the brothers but you Brothers will give an account for your wife can I say that one more time since y'all are silent I'm G to say it again so you hear what I said brother Brown said you sisters you're free from that you're free from from being deacons and having to make raw decisions sometimes that that maybe are are are against your emotion right um against your love right cuz you can be deceived more than we can and I'm sorry that's what that's just the way the makeup is that's why brother BR you know that's why God said there'll be no pastors that are women there'll be no pastors that are deacons is everybody with me on this I and you sisters should glory in that all you got to do is is take care of your husband sure you got a job sure some of you don't have husbands but your husband is Christ please take care of him he's the one that marries you he's the one that's he's more important to me than June is sorry that's right you got to put it that way but he gave you a good wife then cherish her listen to her but there has to be one controlling factor and that has to be the men and like I said before I don't apologize for saying it I apologize if I hurt your feelings and it's like well you're excluding us you ought to be happy that you don't have to stand up here and listen to phone calls three or four times a day and and and different things and have to handle stuff I I I want to tell you something real quick I watched my dad wear yourself out for you guys okay everybody with me in the 90s before I came to the Lord remember I think I told you this one time before I wasn't serving the lord in the early part of the 90s so Dad would be sitting here and you know dealing with y'all I mean some of you weren't here but he was dealing with situations in the church and and I thought man he's a rockage ofro this guy he come to my house and he'd sit down and he'd have a look on his face like I ain't never seen before and he say hey would you just put on a hunting video would you put some on so we can watch and right I knew then he was having trying to deal he took listen he took something home with him that he was dealing with in his mind as a human being trying to trying to uh stand between God and the people and do the right thing and not do it partial not do it leaning toward one side but he say just just put on hunting video and let's watch a hunting video he won't talk about nothing we'd eat you know and fellowship a little bit his family but he's just like you know I I just I want to get away from this but that's the burden that a pastor has and I and I appreciate your um your vote of confidence and like I said before the ones of you that didn't vote for me I give me some time hadn't done this before just love me if I quit preaching the word of God you have a right to leave that's right rest of the time kind of hang on okay I'm going to try to preach the word of God and let everybody kind of just you you know I'm not brother Dale um it's a different Administration it it's going to be and it is we hate change we're humans but we got to go as I said in this look the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing right and I appreciate all your sisters in this church you work your fingers to the Bone but get behind your husband don't be enemy he's got enough don't be be his be his lover be his strength be the one he can cry on their shoulder if he needs to be that for your husband you say well my husband just sits in a Pew he got problems too hello right he got problems too but I love y'all and until God takes me away from this place then we're going to try to preach the word of God the best we can we're going to try to make decisions that helps each and every one of you including the sisters but today this afternoon we're just going to meet with the brothers and just look at some things because they are the heads of state they do uh run the part of the church we're an organism not an organization and an organism has many things that we need to work with We Appreciate You sisters that teach Sunday school but according to brother brandham Sunday school teachers up until about a teenage can be a woman but after that a man should be the one and that's what we have that here and that's fine stay in your place I read a quote yesterday brother R said deacons don't try to be trustees pastors don't try to be deacons trustees don't try to be board of directors sit in your position so sisters you got a position and it's very honorable no dishonor at all because God said if he called the man through brother brandom if you called the man he called the wife too okay so as much as he called brother Dale he called sister Dale too and just pray for the family let's sing a song before we dismiss oh I just come to glor glorify your name I just want to glorify glorify his name there's no greater name I know I tell it I tell it wherever I go glori glorify his name oh I
