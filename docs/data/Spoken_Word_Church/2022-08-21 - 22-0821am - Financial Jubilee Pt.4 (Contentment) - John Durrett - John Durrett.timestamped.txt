[0:00] heart you know continue with this
[0:01] financial jubilee
[0:03] so uh perhaps when
[0:04] everybody's out of debt and
[0:06] everybody's content
[0:08] then we'll stop financial jubilee
[0:12] but um certainly financial jubilee as i
[0:14] said you know if you look in the word
[0:15] and our prophet said that word jubilee
[0:17] means we can go free
[0:19] you know when you hear that trumpet
[0:20] sound we can go free by his grace
[0:23] and financial jubilee you know it's um
[0:27] talking about finances and money anyway
[0:29] it's not a i wouldn't say it's a deep
[0:31] subject
[0:32] you know it's a
[0:35] shallow subject i would say
[0:38] but it certainly have some some deep
[0:40] impacts to our life
[0:42] but one thing i was looking at earlier
[0:44] this week is even in shallow water
[0:46] people drown right
[0:49] shallow water and i was surprised is
[0:51] about 25 of drownings happen in shallow
[0:54] water
[0:56] and i got to thinking about that and i'm
[0:58] like my goodness you know a lot of the
[1:00] shallow water
[1:02] things that
[1:03] impact our lives that we would say
[1:06] shallow
[1:07] compared to the deep things which i know
[1:09] in this hour we need those deep things
[1:11] we know we're not going to have a
[1:12] rapture unless we can swim in the deep
[1:15] that's for sure
[1:18] but
[1:19] you know if we don't know how to swim in
[1:20] the shallow water we can certainly get
[1:23] drowned there as well
[1:25] know matter of fact there's something
[1:26] called a shallow water blackout and this
[1:29] impacts
[1:30] professional swimmers they get in there
[1:33] and they're swimming and they're holding
[1:34] their breath and they black out
[1:37] underwater
[1:38] and of course then their body reacts and
[1:40] they have to breathe and they end up
[1:42] drowning
[1:44] so it doesn't matter you know how long
[1:46] we've been in the message how long we've
[1:47] been in the word you know how long we've
[1:50] been
[1:51] doing things if we don't get these
[1:52] shallow water things we can have an
[1:55] ineffective christian life
[1:58] and we know our prophet said even you
[1:59] know you can get in those shallow water
[2:01] all that debris and you can get hung up
[2:03] in that debris
[2:05] although we have a power but if we don't
[2:07] know how to operate in that shallow
[2:08] water then we can get hung up and die
[2:11] and have an ineffective life and that's
[2:13] certainly not not the purpose
[2:16] brothers we want to go to the next slide
[2:20] and
[2:20] i was just reading this quote my kids
[2:22] and i we were playing the game of life i
[2:24] don't know if you all have played that
[2:26] game a couple weeks ago
[2:28] and um you know we i we hadn't played in
[2:30] a while so i was going through the
[2:31] instructions trying to remind them okay
[2:34] once you start you can you can choose to
[2:35] go to college or you can choose to start
[2:37] your career right away in the game and
[2:40] then you go on and then you you know you
[2:42] get married and you pick up a spouse
[2:45] along the way and it's a little car you
[2:47] put the spouse in the car and of course
[2:49] my girls they were like no put the man
[2:50] in the back he's going in the back
[2:52] so we all pray for them so
[2:56] you know and then the babies come along
[2:58] and you start putting a little peg
[2:59] they're like no we don't want any babies
[3:01] so yeah y'all just keep them in prayer
[3:04] but as we got to talking you know i was
[3:06] telling them i said you know yeah this
[3:08] is exactly like the word of god you know
[3:09] if we don't know the rules and we won't
[3:12] be effective in this life
[3:14] and as i was uh just looking through the
[3:17] quotes it's actually yesterday
[3:19] and this quote brother broom says and
[3:21] that's the way it is with human life
[3:24] you can't play the rules of the game of
[3:27] life wrong and expect to win
[3:30] you've got to play it according to god's
[3:32] word and the purpose that you were
[3:35] brought here for
[3:37] now there are so many people that
[3:38] doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose
[3:40] in life
[3:41] especially in this day that we now live
[3:43] people just seem to think that all they
[3:45] have to do is keep up with someone else
[3:48] with the fashions of this world and with
[3:50] the enticements of this world
[3:53] has given to them and that's exactly
[3:55] right you know in all of us
[3:57] in in this day and time it is such a
[4:00] a um a wicked day in time such a
[4:03] enticing day and time i mean my goodness
[4:06] it's like the world is going mad you
[4:09] know if you look at the internet social
[4:12] media i mean it's so much influence
[4:15] my goodness you can't run through your
[4:16] your facebook feeds without seeing this
[4:19] person is doing this to their house this
[4:21] person's getting this car this person is
[4:23] doing that this person is joined their
[4:24] meal i mean you can't even sit down and
[4:27] enjoy your meal without thinking i need
[4:28] to take a picture of it before we
[4:31] eat don't eat honey you wait let's show
[4:33] them that we're having shrimp and we're
[4:35] going to have this and that's all you
[4:37] see
[4:38] you know and this it's just all enticing
[4:40] and then we're trying to you know outdo
[4:42] the other one and i'll do the other one
[4:44] so it's very difficult to have
[4:45] contentment right you know and not just
[4:48] in the in the area of money but churches
[4:50] as well i mean you can find any church
[4:52] any minister that suits just how you
[4:55] want so if they move to the left you
[4:56] like that if they move backwards if they
[4:58] do the moonwalk i mean whatever you want
[5:00] you can find it
[5:02] if you want it really deep you can find
[5:03] it really deep if you want it really
[5:04] quiet you can find it really quiet
[5:06] whatever you want you can find it all
[5:09] right now we can pull it up right now
[5:10] and find many many different services
[5:13] so all of that is in our minds and is
[5:15] causing us to lose contentment and
[5:18] contentment just means satisfied with
[5:20] where you are right now today that's
[5:24] what it means that's what contentment is
[5:25] all about
[5:27] and it's very very important in all
[5:29] areas you got that within marriage money
[5:33] anxiety you got mental battles all of
[5:36] those things are those shallow water
[5:38] things that
[5:39] we get hung up in
[5:41] and we need god in his grace to get us
[5:43] out of those things
[5:47] go to the next
[5:49] and certainly you know those things are
[5:51] right in line although we have this word
[5:53] and this quote just says a lot just keep
[5:55] walking in the light it'll separate the
[5:57] thing that was hindering you from one
[5:59] side to the other
[6:01] that's the trouble with the church today
[6:04] you're so loaded down you can't walk
[6:06] light
[6:08] got too many things on you too much
[6:10] hanging around
[6:11] paul said let us lay aside every weight
[6:14] that we may walk light
[6:16] every weight and the sin that so easily
[6:18] beset us that we may run with patience
[6:21] the race that is set before us looking
[6:23] to the author and the finisher christ
[6:27] walk in the light light footed you know
[6:29] i i love i really love that quote you
[6:32] know because that that's when i look at
[6:33] financial jubilee and contentment that's
[6:37] really what it's saying trying to get us
[6:38] to where we can walk light and these
[6:40] principles of money they apply to all
[6:43] areas of your life even this word that
[6:45] we have it applies to the word and i've
[6:47] experienced that you know the same
[6:49] principles that i use to to get out of
[6:52] debt to learn this contentment
[6:55] it's the same principles that i see in
[6:57] walking this journey walking this path
[7:01] and again contentment it means
[7:02] satisfaction with one's possession
[7:05] status and situation as i mentioned it's
[7:07] the hardest age and the last thing we
[7:10] need in this age is discontentment
[7:14] and that's exactly what we're suffering
[7:16] with
[7:18] go to the next
[7:21] so in the in the area of money as you
[7:23] you hear this again you know this is
[7:25] just
[7:26] a parallel to apply to every area of
[7:29] your life but the wonderful thing about
[7:31] money what i like about it is all of us
[7:33] can relate as i said before all of us
[7:34] can relate to it you're working for it
[7:36] you're getting up in the morning before
[7:37] you're talking about it you're wondering
[7:39] how much your spouse is spending all of
[7:41] that
[7:41] we deal with it every day so we can all
[7:43] relate to it and i believe god knew that
[7:45] and that's why he said so many things in
[7:47] his word about money
[7:49] but this quote this this message and
[7:51] this scripture i think just brings it
[7:53] back it says if therefore you have not
[7:56] been faithful in the unrighteous mammon
[7:58] who will commit to your trust the true
[8:01] riches
[8:02] so if you have not been trustworthy in
[8:04] handling worthy wealth who will trust
[8:07] you with true riches
[8:09] and we know our lord said that and i
[8:12] believe that is the area of money that
[8:14] he's trying to get to us like this is
[8:16] just worldly wealth something we would
[8:18] think is shallow but he said if you
[8:20] can't handle that who
[8:22] who and he's really talking about
[8:24] himself that i won't trust you with
[8:26] these true riches
[8:28] and we know we know that statue of a
[8:30] perfect man those are the promises those
[8:32] are the true things that we're after by
[8:34] his grace he said i i won't trust you
[8:37] with those things if you can't handle
[8:40] this life thing
[8:42] and i always think of um you know
[8:44] hearing brother dale and
[8:46] you know talked about you know back in
[8:48] the in the early days when he said hey
[8:49] you know a lot of the message people
[8:51] they weren't going to make the rapture
[8:53] you know and that was a shock here in
[8:55] that you know because i hadn't heard
[8:56] that before like wow you mean back then
[8:59] someone was saying that a lot of people
[9:01] not gonna make it not that they're not
[9:03] born again not that they're not saved
[9:06] you see
[9:07] but they won't make
[9:08] what's promised in this age that rapture
[9:11] why because they're just doing the same
[9:13] things that has always been done and i
[9:15] believe it's the same thing if we don't
[9:17] know how to handle money we're going to
[9:19] live our lives we're going to take out
[9:21] loans we're gonna borrow money we're
[9:22] gonna try to pay it back and we hope
[9:25] when we end
[9:26] perhaps it balance out or hey your kids
[9:29] will deal with it when you're gone
[9:31] that's kind of how we approach it like
[9:32] hey let's just see what happens let's go
[9:34] around play but god and his bible have
[9:36] these principles already laid out
[9:38] so isn't it amazing if we could apply
[9:40] these principles then that gives us the
[9:42] opportunity to see what god can do in
[9:45] this small area just to give him an
[9:47] opportunity to see what he can do in
[9:49] this area that we can then say wow lord
[9:52] if you can do this with something so
[9:54] small what can you do with these things
[9:56] that you're promised to me
[9:58] lord god that's what i want to see i
[10:00] want to have that opportunity to
[10:01] experience that in my lifetime which by
[10:03] his grace
[10:05] i have seen some of that i've seen him
[10:07] work in miracles through the principles
[10:10] that i have applied through
[10:12] this financial jubilee
[10:16] again you know we will never be
[10:18] effective with money or again to see
[10:20] that opportunity to see what god will do
[10:22] in this small area
[10:25] same principles i said apply in the
[10:27] statue of a perfect man that's what i
[10:29] hear when i hear the word i can apply it
[10:31] the same way
[10:34] so again we don't want to
[10:36] miss out on this small opportunity to
[10:37] see what god will do
[10:39] and then apply it to those true riches
[10:41] because i believe by that you were going
[10:44] to and this is the promise of this hour
[10:46] we're going to experience something that
[10:47] has never been experienced in any age
[10:50] before
[10:51] any age
[10:52] but the same thing within your family
[10:54] you can experience something that
[10:56] the world hasn't
[10:58] experienced just in this small area
[11:01] of finances and i believe god can do
[11:04] that so we're gonna just run through the
[11:06] principles
[11:08] once again that i brought out before
[11:12] and it's eight principles the last
[11:14] principle is contentment and we're just
[11:16] going to focus on that a little bit more
[11:18] in this sunday school lesson but
[11:20] principle number one remember god's own
[11:22] at all he owns it all the 10 tides are
[11:24] his and the 90
[11:26] it's it's all his we pay the 10 and he
[11:29] allows us to use the 90 but it's all his
[11:32] so we should be praying when we have
[11:34] that 90 percent
[11:36] lord what would you have me do no it's
[11:38] not a stressful thing it's not a
[11:39] worrying thing we go we know we need to
[11:41] buy food we know we need to plan we know
[11:43] we need to do all those things but it's
[11:44] his
[11:45] so he said lord is it if it's okay with
[11:47] you lord i'm gonna do this as lord if
[11:48] it's your will let me do this
[11:50] the 90 but we don't squander we don't
[11:52] waste we think about what we're doing
[11:55] because it's all his
[11:57] two manage his resources
[11:59] sources diligently get organized
[12:02] we have to diligence is key you know and
[12:05] that's one thing about i think teaching
[12:07] an attention teaching ministry you can
[12:09] see it takes diligence i mean yes it's
[12:12] lesson after lesson trying to get it
[12:14] into us but those lessons
[12:17] that should be applied to our life daily
[12:20] you see so we see you know brother wade
[12:22] is on lesson 59
[12:24] you know we're on financial jubilee
[12:25] number four
[12:27] but that's just us presenting that's
[12:29] just me talking about it but you got to
[12:31] go in your daily life and now apply it
[12:34] you see what i'm saying so if i've been
[12:35] living i'm 44 years old then by god's
[12:38] grace you know i should be diligently
[12:40] applying that year after year word after
[12:42] word word after word every day
[12:45] diligently being organized thinking what
[12:47] about what i'm doing and if i can't be
[12:50] organized and diligent and maybe i need
[12:52] to slow down
[12:53] slow down just a little bit
[12:55] you know that's one thing i've enjoyed
[12:57] about the word here is just slowing down
[12:59] taking your time making sure we're
[13:02] getting it making sure there is no room
[13:04] no excuses just presenting it slowing it
[13:07] down
[13:08] and that's what happens when we're not
[13:09] slow we can't be organized you got
[13:11] receipts flying over here this happened
[13:12] over there this you know i'm borrowing
[13:14] money from here trying to do that
[13:16] you know that's what i used to do
[13:19] you know when i started out out of
[13:20] college man i thought i was a wise smart
[13:23] dude i'm telling you i could borrow from
[13:25] this person to borrow that person to pay
[13:28] back that and try to make a little
[13:29] interest in between that's what i was
[13:31] doing like yes this is only two percent
[13:33] i'm gonna pick this card i'm gonna do
[13:35] that card
[13:36] did that for years and didn't have a
[13:38] dime
[13:39] right
[13:40] money was moving but i had nothing
[13:43] but when i started slowing down i said
[13:45] you know what i've been working for 10
[13:46] years
[13:48] and i have like nothing like i don't
[13:50] have anything
[13:52] and his word says you know there's oil
[13:55] oil in the house of the wise you know
[13:57] and i'm like i don't have any oil
[14:00] so something is just not right
[14:02] why is everything i have coming in going
[14:04] out
[14:05] and i started slowing down getting
[14:07] organized thinking about what i'm
[14:08] spending my money on little things
[14:11] you know before you know it you're
[14:12] spending five and six hundred dollars
[14:14] out to eat a month 800 a thousand or you
[14:17] just don't know
[14:19] so that could be one little small
[14:21] ideas you know what let me just
[14:24] watch what i spent out on eating out
[14:26] you might shock your own self
[14:29] and realize oh
[14:30] that's why i don't have an emergency
[14:33] fund i ate it
[14:37] you gotta
[14:39] take your time
[14:41] money is your time you purchase stuff
[14:43] with your time again you're working
[14:47] your husband your spouse working you're
[14:49] putting in your time then if you waste
[14:51] that you're wasting that time that you
[14:53] have
[14:54] my mind
[14:56] patience learning to wait oh this
[14:59] patience is is so important and i
[15:01] believe that's why the scripture says
[15:02] run with patience
[15:05] run we got to be in action but it's a
[15:07] patient run
[15:08] learning to wait this is one of the keys
[15:12] and of course if we wait on god that
[15:13] gives him the opportunity
[15:16] by his grace
[15:19] next slide
[15:22] number five avoid debt like the curse
[15:24] that's it the blessings of the lord and
[15:26] make it rich and he added no sorrow to
[15:28] it certainly the devil will make a way
[15:30] whatever you want he will make a way
[15:33] and he can find a way to help you and
[15:35] your needs believe me but that's all his
[15:38] tactics to get you trapped up into the
[15:40] weeds trapped up bound down can't be
[15:43] free with the lord that's what he wants
[15:45] to do
[15:47] save winter is coming save a little very
[15:50] very important take some of your money
[15:52] and save some of it
[15:54] there's nothing at all wrong with that
[15:56] you have to do that that's why he said
[15:58] watch that ant winter is coming you know
[16:00] those ants they store up food i was the
[16:03] other day just cleaning up outside and
[16:04] moving some rocks and i moved some rocks
[16:06] and a whole bunch of ants
[16:08] and they had these these white things
[16:10] they started moving around first they
[16:11] were like relaxed but i disturbed their
[16:13] habitat and they started moving so i
[16:15] just sat there and i thought about this
[16:16] scripture i said you know what let me
[16:17] just watch and see what they did man
[16:19] they didn't stop working at all they
[16:21] started moving those eggs started
[16:24] putting them in holes and and just
[16:26] working working non-stop no distraction
[16:29] i didn't send any one of them taking a
[16:31] selfie picture i didn't see any of that
[16:33] going on
[16:34] they weren't comparing each other they
[16:36] were moving
[16:38] and before long all those eggs i mean
[16:40] it's probably like 50 to 75 every egg
[16:43] was moved
[16:45] man i was like wow that is quite amazing
[16:48] so i went up just looked up those eggs
[16:50] like yeah those are they're they're the
[16:51] lavas and they have to protect those
[16:54] young ones so they're moving around and
[16:56] making sure
[16:57] and it's like you know what they're
[16:59] they're thinking about that next
[17:00] generation
[17:01] you know they're thinking about if their
[17:02] whole colony gets wiped out they have
[17:04] put those
[17:06] babies in a safe place
[17:08] you know and i believe wow god thought
[17:10] about that he thought of that he wanted
[17:12] to make sure that he left us that word
[17:14] and i believe that's why it's the voice
[17:15] that we have in this day he left that to
[17:17] make sure from generation to generation
[17:19] here we are we have that same word he
[17:22] stored that thing he protected it
[17:24] because he knew he would need it
[17:25] amen
[17:27] but all that just around the ant you
[17:29] know and that's how we need to think you
[17:30] know we got kids we got young ones we
[17:32] got family members we have to think
[17:34] we're going to get older all of us i'm
[17:36] getting older we're all getting older
[17:38] you know my dad was like the hardest
[17:40] working person i knew period
[17:42] he he could outwork anybody
[17:45] but he's 84 years old now so he knows
[17:48] like hey i can't do exactly the same
[17:49] things i used to do
[17:51] you know and he didn't have that that
[17:53] wisdom at that time you know what let me
[17:55] put away something because i will be
[17:58] older and here we are he's now older
[18:02] you know and i'm looking at that like
[18:03] wow that is something else but here this
[18:05] word of god has always told us hey
[18:08] put a little bit away store something up
[18:10] don't spend all that we have
[18:14] the best investment of course is giving
[18:16] to the kingdom of god it's more blessed
[18:18] to give than to receive by his grace and
[18:20] the amen being in a position where we
[18:22] can do that freely
[18:24] freely by his grace and then contentment
[18:26] oh that's it contentment it's learned
[18:28] it's something you have to apply every
[18:31] day and by managing your resources
[18:33] diligently thinking about financial
[18:35] jubilee you can start learning oh man
[18:38] when we started paying off that debt my
[18:39] family and i met it was the gr it was
[18:42] that was a a certainly a milestone in
[18:45] our marriage in our home because
[18:47] contentment came in oh man just to eat
[18:50] out you know we had to be
[18:52] you talking about diligent i think we
[18:54] had like you know twenty dollars a month
[18:56] to eat out
[18:57] but i'll tell you those burgers never
[18:58] taste better
[19:00] i'm telling you when you did get to go
[19:01] to mcdonald's i mean every fry was like
[19:04] woo
[19:05] my goodness
[19:07] and i love that you know i love that but
[19:10] you eat out every day i'm telling you
[19:12] like i don't i'm tired of domino's pizza
[19:15] you know i'm tired of
[19:16] you know applebee's oh no i can't even
[19:21] that's exactly what's happening and
[19:24] that's in every area of our life you
[19:25] know i'm tired oh the church is it's so
[19:27] slow it's just dragging on
[19:30] oh and then over there the other church
[19:31] is like oh they're so loud i can't hear
[19:33] anything you know i wish they would slow
[19:35] down that's exactly what the devil wants
[19:37] to get us in the place where we're just
[19:39] discontent
[19:40] we haven't learned we haven't set still
[19:42] long enough to learn contentment and
[19:45] apply it in our lives
[19:47] help us lord
[19:49] go to the next slide
[19:51] so again contentment is learned paul
[19:54] learned god will teach you if you apply
[19:56] his principles
[19:57] paul says not that i speak in respect of
[19:59] want for i have learned in whatever
[20:02] state i am therewith be content
[20:05] amen whatever state he said i learned
[20:08] that and we're going to find out how he
[20:09] actually learned that he says let your
[20:11] conversation be without covetousness and
[20:13] be content with such things as you have
[20:16] for he has said
[20:17] i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[20:20] so we're getting a little little hint in
[20:22] what paul is saying that helped him
[20:24] reach that contentment he said because
[20:26] god said i will never leave thee nor
[20:28] forsake thee
[20:31] amen
[20:32] go to the next
[20:37] amen so i'm gonna go to the next slide
[20:39] brothers
[20:41] it says but godliness with contentment
[20:43] is great gain for we brought nothing
[20:44] into this world and it's certain we can
[20:46] carry nothing out and having food and
[20:48] remnant
[20:50] be there with content
[20:52] amen godliness now notice how he says
[20:55] that godliness so he's saying hey we can
[20:58] be godly
[21:00] and we could not have contentment
[21:03] because he's saying godliness with
[21:05] contentment is great gain
[21:07] so with god he's trying to give us these
[21:10] great things
[21:12] you know that's he's trying to beat us
[21:14] down with his blessings if we can apply
[21:16] his word
[21:18] godliness with contentment so by his
[21:20] grace that's what we're trying to share
[21:22] how do i get this great gain in my life
[21:25] of course right after that beat but seek
[21:26] ye first the kingdom of god and his
[21:29] righteousness and all these things shall
[21:30] be added unto you
[21:32] telling us hey god is in control
[21:34] that's it god is in control that's
[21:37] pointing out some of that cure that we
[21:38] have to seek god we have to wait on god
[21:40] we got to be able to put him first
[21:43] my mind you know i was hearing a story
[21:45] about a a uh a single married couple
[21:48] right you know they went into a
[21:49] restaurant and
[21:50] you know you see a single couple and a
[21:52] single well not a single couple a single
[21:54] person and they had their book and they
[21:56] had you know a little latte and oh it
[21:59] just they were so relaxed and feeling so
[22:01] good they're just gonna enjoy themselves
[22:03] with their latte and whipped cream on
[22:05] top and all of that
[22:07] until a married couple walked in and the
[22:08] married couple walked in they were
[22:09] holding hands and look at each other and
[22:11] you know sipping each other's latte and
[22:13] that single person said oh lord you see
[22:15] i'm just so
[22:16] lord that's what i'm missing in my life
[22:18] i just don't have somebody who i can sip
[22:20] latte with and oh lord it's just so
[22:22] miserable lord i'm just so
[22:24] down and out not knowing that the
[22:25] married couple's looking at them like oh
[22:27] man if i could just get a date by myself
[22:29] oh my goodness and read my book
[22:33] that's what it's doing and the devil's
[22:35] just playing a field day on all of us
[22:37] through all of that
[22:38] and that's what it is if we could just
[22:40] get into our own position with god right
[22:43] where you are right where he has placed
[22:45] you and start pulling start pulling for
[22:47] what you need and realizing what you
[22:49] have
[22:50] amen so it's so valuable to
[22:53] guard our commitment
[22:55] amen
[22:56] that's it we crave what we don't have
[22:58] overlooking the blessings that we
[23:00] already have
[23:02] and that's it we got to pause we got to
[23:04] slow down
[23:05] by his grace
[23:09] now as we're kind of nearing time is
[23:12] running out
[23:13] but i'm just going to kind of leave you
[23:14] with with this piece of it see
[23:16] contentment and i want to make sure i
[23:17] think this is a very very important
[23:19] point go to the next slide
[23:22] go to the next
[23:25] see it's really important because now
[23:27] contentment
[23:29] is different from being indifferent and
[23:32] different means like i don't care
[23:34] like i'm you know it doesn't matter to
[23:36] me what kind of car i have
[23:38] doesn't matter
[23:40] you know my car is not running it's
[23:42] breaking down i'm still okay
[23:44] you know i'm just satisfied no no no no
[23:47] no that that's that's different
[23:49] you know brother brennaman liking that
[23:50] to a bum that bum that came to his house
[23:52] and he said where are you going he said
[23:54] well
[23:55] um nowhere so where you been well i've
[23:58] just been wandering around wherever my
[23:59] hat lays that's where i've been he said
[24:01] how long you been doing that well about
[24:02] 20 years
[24:04] he said man no that's no ambition
[24:07] he said our ambition just should be set
[24:09] to higher things that's what it is
[24:12] and god says delight thyself also in the
[24:14] lord and he shall give thee the desires
[24:17] of thine heart so it's not taking away
[24:19] your desire
[24:20] you see but it's calling god in the
[24:23] scene of that desire
[24:25] bringing him in
[24:27] being content that's what it means not
[24:29] not caring but having a desire so let's
[24:31] say something for example in the church
[24:34] something in your life something in your
[24:35] marriage something in your finances that
[24:37] it's not working out the way you think
[24:38] it should work out
[24:40] okay
[24:41] now to say well i don't it doesn't
[24:42] matter to me
[24:44] that's no it said lord no it does matter
[24:46] to me father but i know to apply it to
[24:48] wait on you to give you that opportunity
[24:50] lord to move and that's where it's
[24:53] running with patience you see it didn't
[24:54] say you sleeping with patients it didn't
[24:57] say you're sitting with patients it says
[24:58] running with patience so it's having our
[25:01] mindset on lord you have promises for me
[25:03] lord you have promises in the word for
[25:06] me
[25:07] father and that's what i want by your
[25:08] grace
[25:10] let's go to
[25:11] skip to slide 12 for me brothers and
[25:13] we'll finish up with with this scripture
[25:16] i think this just kind of answers it at
[25:19] all how to learn contentment
[25:24] starts off be careful which is anxious
[25:28] for nothing well but it was some things
[25:29] what about my marriage what about my
[25:31] church what about my car no for nothing
[25:33] what about my job what about the pastor
[25:36] what about the answers that i need in my
[25:37] life should i be anxious about no be
[25:39] anxious for nothing
[25:42] be anxious for nothing
[25:44] he even has that before prayer
[25:48] get your anxiousness out
[25:50] put that to the side
[25:52] because you approach god and you're
[25:53] anxious you're just telling god what you
[25:55] want you're not ready to listen you're
[25:57] not ready to be patient you're just
[25:59] telling god this is what i lord i gotta
[26:01] have this i
[26:02] was like well the lord like well
[26:04] you're you're telling me
[26:06] you know no get that anxious anxiety be
[26:09] anxious for nothing slow down but in
[26:12] everything now
[26:14] by prayer and supplication
[26:16] with thanksgiving now you're saying
[26:18] you're seeing some of the tools prayer
[26:21] bring god into the
[26:22] situation with supplication there's
[26:25] humbleness a humble request with
[26:27] thanksgiving
[26:29] lord god let me think about what i'm
[26:31] thankful for in my life oh my if you can
[26:33] just think of those testimonies and
[26:34] things in your life where you just took
[26:36] enough time to thank god
[26:38] to thank god for his blessings in your
[26:40] life
[26:41] bring him in through prayer through
[26:43] supplication with thanksgiving
[26:46] then let your request be known unto god
[26:49] in the peace of god which passes all
[26:52] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[26:54] minds through christ jesus
[26:56] amen that peace of god to keep your mind
[26:59] amen passes all understanding so it's
[27:02] bringing you back don't lean on your own
[27:03] understanding don't lean on your own
[27:05] understanding as you wait on the lord in
[27:08] this small thing of financial jubilee if
[27:10] you're asking the lord for something in
[27:11] regards to money and finances
[27:13] you're saving for something don't lean
[27:15] on your own understanding give him an
[27:16] opportunity to move long as you're doing
[27:18] what you're supposed to do doing the
[27:20] best you know how
[27:21] you can ask you can pray you can get rid
[27:23] of the anxiety and then wait on god
[27:25] again that's just a small area of money
[27:27] but think about everything with the lord
[27:29] even this word as we pray and that lord
[27:31] god reveal more to me you are part of
[27:34] that ingredient
[27:36] and you know what and
[27:38] you know i worked at kfc
[27:40] years ago
[27:41] and um we had to marinate that chicken
[27:43] you know it just didn't turn out right
[27:45] if you just took it out and threw it and
[27:46] we had to actually marinate and put in
[27:47] the freezer so some things take time
[27:50] they take time and god is waiting on us
[27:52] to just to get just right when we're
[27:54] ready and that's that marination that
[27:56] says waiting on the lord letting his
[27:58] peace come into our heart as we wait on
[28:00] him we're still taking our request to
[28:02] him
[28:02] we care about the things that god put on
[28:04] our hearts to care about and we're
[28:06] waiting on the lord
[28:07] amen and the peace of god which passes
[28:10] understanding shall keep
[28:12] your hearts and minds through christ
[28:14] jesus amen so it's a little bit on
[28:16] contentment of course this is so much
[28:18] more the musicians can get ready to come
[28:20] up certainly god bless you all you know
[28:23] apply these things to our life as we
[28:25] walk this journey as we walk through
[28:27] this word again this is just a small
[28:29] thing that we can take every day to
[28:32] apply it to get that same discipline
[28:33] that we need to get into that deep water
[28:36] the same discipline in this shallow
[28:38] water we can take it into the deep areas
[28:41] amen and be ready for what god has in
[28:43] them for us in this hour
