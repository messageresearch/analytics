TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just lord open these things up to our heart as we study these scriptures lord today and and unpack the things that paul said uh thousands of years ago lord we ask that order you'll just be with brother wait as he's preparing oh god and open our hearts lord jesus to receive what you have in store for us today in your name amen now we're uh you know just just to kind of summarize what we left off in hebrews you know we paul paul kind of set the stage that we've heard from someone greater than all the prophets greater than greater than the angels the the one that we've heard through as god and heard from as god himself and and uh you know paul i i you know you read what paul's saying and sometimes it's hard to understand but he's it's such an encouraging message that he's bringing in the book of hebrews he's telling us to do do better than the israelites who who who kind of gave up in the wilderness who got so complained in the wilderness and and kind of got bogged down with uh with their own own desires and and and lost sight of what god wanted them to do to make it to the promised land and and paul is telling us to strive to enter into the into the rest enter into the rest that uh the rest of god's word we're not resting on our own works or or what we're doing in ourselves but we're resting on god's promises and then you know really the theme of the book of hebrews is we'll get to it in hebrews chapter 10 that i've got here up on the sleep on the slide but the law is a shadow all those things in the old testament were a shadow of something that we have access to now that we're speaking of a life to come the life of christ will be given to us and all the things that you see in the in the old testament tabernacle and the rights of the high priest and the uh the the way that things were conducted all the the the way that that everything in the tabernacle was built and the way that the priest behaved and everything was a shadow speaking of of christ's coming that he would tabernacle himself and us and so really you know when you when you read through the book of hebrew read through hebrews chapter seven and and you you begin to look at what milk what paul's saying about melchizedek you really need to have it within that context of what that is to really understand it that that paul's he's trying to make the case that um the chickens are moving around my backyard again i gotta ignore that swipe one paul paul is trying to make the case that that the the law that there's the law has to change that the priesthood has to change there's coming a new covenant the covenant has to change and so he's sitting setting all that uh in view as he's as he's explaining about who who is this melchizedek who was that melchizedek so hebrews chapter 10 says for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there and too perfect so what's paul trying to lay out for us in hebrews that that if you want perfection it doesn't come and he's writing to the hebrews it doesn't come by what you think god wanted you to to you know by by trying to fulfill some the the law about by working it out and trying to try to just be a good person trying to trying to be a good person like the uh the rich young ruler that came to jesus and said well i've done all these things but he jesus told the rich young ruler yeah but you're lacking something what you're what are you lacking you're lacking a relationship with christ you're lacking the life of christ a personal relationship with christ all of those things could i make the believer perfect perfection only comes by christ and so that's that's really who is melchizedek that melchizedek is the one that can make you perfect so you know we we need a we need a priest after the order of melchizedek we need a priest that could uh so paul in hebrews chapter eight he's saying for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second if that first covenant was faultless then you wouldn't need another covenant you wouldn't need another testament there was something lacking in that first covenant the first testament for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers on the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord now you you last time we talked about how that you know that they had been searching for that royal high priest to come that they looked for you know the requirements couldn't be met in the flesh by by abraham or by isaac or by jacob or joseph but when this man come out out of nowhere melchizedek he come here's the one that's going to be able to satisfy now maybe maybe just kind of set in your mind what's what's the difference between that melchizedek and jesus the difference is the melchizedek when he came he could he couldn't he couldn't uh god's got to come in the flesh to be your kinsmen so the difference is that when when god put that life in in that manger now he's manifested in the flesh so that he can bring to pass that new testament that new covenant that uh that god could come down and die for your sins and pay the price for you and atone so so the melchizedek couldn't usher in that new new testament he couldn't he couldn't move move you into that new new covenant but christ when he came he could and it's you know don't get in your mind that it's a different people it's the same god it's the same person the whole time now now you you talk about um let me see okay here we go let me get my slides mixed up so hebrews chapter seven when we were reading it says uh in verse three it says without uh well let's just read the whole thing again for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness what that's actually what melchizedek means mel uh melky is uh is is actually the hebrew for king and sedek is is a hebrew for righteousness so you know the hebrew i was listening to this rabbi talking about melchizedek and boy he was all confused he was saying that that paul raped jeremiah's words and all sorts of horrible things that but anyway the way that the hebrews pronounced melchizedek because they actually pronounced it as like two different words milky cedec so you take those two words king and righteousness and tack them together and you've got melchizedek means the king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth the priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils now let's just rehash what you know looking at verse 3 there without father without mother without descent you know we talked last time about how that that god just just flipped everything that the jews understood on his head when he this man when christ finally came he come out of the tribe of judah in other words he just threw out all kinds of genealogy with somebody i think that's one of the the greatest uh misunderstandings that people in the message have is that that you're that your new birth or your eternal life or any kind of relationship you have with god is tied to any kind of genealogy so you see you see how god's just throwing that all the way out it's not he didn't he this christ did not come tied to any kind of genealogy like that but this man doesn't have a father or mother he doesn't you know you think about he think about christ when he came that that the bible says in matthew chapter one the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with a child of the holy ghost so mary wasn't his mother he was born of the holy ghost the holy ghost is the one that that created him in the womb that created that flesh that that his life was the holy ghost he didn't have joseph wasn't his father mary wasn't his mother because if you make mary his mother like like a lot of the denominational ideas then you got some kind of you got some really a perverted picture of how he came he came into life so so this melchizedek was without father and mother and then when he was manifest in the flesh christ was without father and mother because it's the same person the flesh the flesh is not what matters you see he took he just discarded all the genealogy or flesh has nothing to do with whether you're born again i wish i i wish we could kind of get get that completely burned out and baked out that we how you come in this natural life has anything to do with your with your new birth i was talking to somebody recently that's uh uh you know just well i'm not gonna get into that listen listen peter even peter when he uh when he began to preach and began to unlock the door he unlocked the door to the to the jews and the gentiles and the samaritans and who did he unlock the gentiles and the samaritans were the people that the jews thought they had no way to receive the new birth a gender a gentile dog or a samaritan that that uh that everybody looked down on that they don't even know where to worship a jew was thinking well we gotta we're special because of our genealogy and here god flipped everything on his head and gave the holy ghost to people that that they thought were just dogs why because there's a promise in the scripture whosoever will whosoever will let him come we've got a we've got a supernatural family tree we got a we got a genealogy that that that a genealogy of above that what's our genealogy genesis 1 26 27 that's our genealogy that you were predestinated in him so so what's melchizedek melchizedek was that life now brother and was saying who was melchizedek he said think of this great person of how great this man would must be which is what what uh what paul said here in in uh verse four now consider how great this man was and to whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils so who was he you as a person a man a personality an eternal person brother adam said he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal and now god changing himself into person the same person the same person all the time veiled in flesh he was the suit the supernatural life is what melchizedek that life this behind the veil which was what paul says in in chapter six he says which hope we have an a as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast this hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast in it and which enterth into that within the veil which is that flesh the veil that he entered into is that flesh whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek now now you see why how we we're tying together uh melchizedek come out seemingly out of nowhere the king of salem and he brought forth wet bread and wine and we're tying that we're tying that in together with with one day christ as when that melchizedek was manifest in the flesh there in the upper room he gave his disciples bread and wine i i hope i hope we can tie that together in our mind of what that's that's that same one that offered abraham bread and wine and now he's as he ushers in a new covenant he's given bread and wine to his disciples this is the new testament in my blood what's the difference now melchizedek couldn't bring in that new covenant but jesus could bring in that new covenant melchize jesus could because he come to die for our sins so in in hebrews chapter 7 and verse 22 he says by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament a better testament and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood he's got he's entered into the behind the veil not not a curtain in the wilderness behind the veil of your heart wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them so now now see what what is what is this new custom new testament that he's speaking of the new testament in my blood there jesus up in that upper room he said after the same manner also he took the cup that paul's speaking of about the communion when he gets up saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it and remembrance of me what is that new testament the new testament the old testament is is putting you in prison that you're you to to show you that you're you're in prison and you're you as as much as you try like david god said he was a man after his own heart but yet he was looking at bathsheba down there on the roof of her building uh taking a bath and you know he there his he needed something to to brother brown when i was listening to a message while i was working in the yard the other day and he said david had the word but what he needed was the spirit he needed that spirit to quicken that word to live in him that's that's the thing that makes you perfect that's what this new testament is the life of christ and the believer to perfect you and change your heart and change the way you think and change the way you live and and give you something that can that can fulfill the law so what's the difference melchizedek could it wasn't able to get you out of the prison house but this new testament will will break your chains but the new testament makes a way for you to get out of the prison house for the law to be satisfied in genesis chapter 14 we looked at it and melchizedek king of salem you see abraham paid ties to melchizedek because he realized he was getting something from this man he realized who this man was that he talked to god you know when you when you come to church and you you realize your chains are being broken and you realize you're hearing from god and you come expecting then then you come with a different attitude you come with a different a different outlook on things and you realize like abraham did this is the one that fought the battle this is the reason that i could come with only 318 men and defeat all these all these uh like the the navy seals and the army rangers of chittel chitterly homer and all of them that he was able because god was on his side and it says he gave him tithe he gave him tithes of all because he recognized who he was serving well you know you know uh brother brown laid out and when he was preaching who was this melchizedek that melchizedek is one person all the time one god and he would say we find that many people teach his three personalities in the god's head so you cannot have a personality without being a person it takes a person to make a personality so who when melchizedek when abraham paid ties to melchizedek he was recognizing that one god when when when the three men came walking to him in the cool of the evening and he met him there in the tent door he he didn't recognize three different people three different gods or three different like like that but he knew who he that man was somebody that he had met before that's why in matthew 28 19 it says jesus said go and bapt and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son of the holy ghost and then in acts 2 38 it says peter said unto them repent be baptized every one in the name of jesus christ because this one god and jesus is his name what's what's the name of that king of righteousness that melchizedek king of rochester that came and talked to abraham his name is jesus christ jesus christ is his name because he said i come in the father's name i come wrapped everything that i stand for is everything that i am all my qualities all my attributes i come to represent that god that nobody knew who his name was in the old testament and all the time of god is changing himself and morph and morphine means change it like i'm putting putting on a mask where you change from one character to the other you know that uh maybe i'm i'm kind of running through some of these quotes a little bit fast so i'll try to slow down a little bit but and morphe comes from in philippians chapter 2 where it says who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon in the form of a serpent and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient under death and morphy means morphy is like morpheus the definition of it is the dictionary said english has no exact equivalent unlike form in english morphe does not mean shape it is a philosophical term that means the outward expression of an inner essence so on the outside you might look like uh you look like you know melchizedek come walking on the outside you look like like jesus christ on the outside start on the day of pentecost god put that same life into the believers so on the outside you've got uh uh you know a different believer peter and john in them but on the inside the inner essence is that life the same life that was manifested in melchizedek so brother ram said the greek word there in morphy means that one person is changing his mass to make him some other character what's the point paul is trying to make that this man christ jesus that paid for our sins that that that brought in a new testament is that same man that walked that walked and talked with abraham he said that's what god did it's the same god all the time god in the form of the father the spirit the pillar of fire the same god was made flesh and dwelt among us and morphy brought out so he could be seen and now that same god is the holy ghost you look i i got a little slide of showing a an actor you i don't know if you know who this actor is it doesn't really matter but this this actor portrayed like like putting on a mask he put on uh in one movie or one film or whatever he he he's portraying this first character and then the next one he's got a top hat on and the next one he's he's got he looks different and and the next the next he's got glasses on and each one he looks a little different but it's the same person all the time and brother brandman said and who is this melchizedek he said changing himself in morphy from one person it was taken from the stage act that one person is changing his mask to make him some other character and brother and we'll talk about how that in the beginning god dwelled alone and he said what made jesus and god different that jesus was the tabernacle that god dwelt in seed now melchizedek jesus had both father and mother and this man never had father and mother jesus had a beginning of life and he had an end of life this man had no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life but it was the self-same person it was melchizedek and jesus was one but jesus was the earthly body born and fashioned after sin what was he saying he had a father and mother he he was he was he was born in flesh he come into the world so that he could be your kinsmen redeemer there's your there's your difference between this melchizedek melchizedek and jesus jesus could die for your sins and and and make a way for that life to come back into the heart of the believer but it's the same person all the time and who is this melchizedek he said his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the second the great eternal second he began to form himself towards flesh in a theophany called the word a word body this then as the state he was in when he met abraham was called melchizedek he was in the form of theophany he was the word so in verse six it says but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here men that die receive time what's he what's point he's trying to make he's trying to make the point that the priesthood paid ties to this man that levi the priesthood came from levi so levi not just in tight but brother man said in the spoken word as the original seed levi paid actually it was counted as though he actually paid ties to melchizedek and so the priesthood that came from levi was less than this man melchizedek because he's the one that that made them the priest of the old testament and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witness that he liveth and as i may say so say levi also who receiveth tithes paid tithes and abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchizedek met him oh you you think about how that that levi levi actually paid ties and and you in the same way actually the life that you have by the new birth was actually there in that melchizedek wrapped up in him because you you are actually that your life is actually part of christ your life is actually part of him that's why we make the statement that as christ is revealed as you as you read the bible and you see the revelation of christ being made known and the word unfolds that it can't help but also reveal you because you're part of him so as his word is revealed to you you begin to understand you yourself and your own journey and your own life and how you fit into that because you're part of him that's that's what that's what the seven seals reveals this but you're replacing you placing you're putting you in as part of this as part of this great plan and brother i will say the thought when it's expressed it's a word a thought expressed as a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attributes then it becomes a thought then a word if you have eternal life you always was those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel star cherubim or anything else that's eternal and brother brown he made this statement and who was this melchizedek he made this wonderful statement that i love he said after he thought it he spoke it and here you are a manifestation a manifestation of that same life back there in genesis 1 26 27 back there that talked to abraham that you were in him you were part of him and that's the story that's that god is that paul is trying to unfold that levi actually paid tithes it was counted to him even though even though he was what uh abraham's great-grandchild abraham isaac jacob levi and uh that god thought about you producing it and we're going to get into something really interesting here but you're as we kind of close and the music is just going to go ahead and come forward but we'll stop on this but brother and we'll say even though even though god thought about you brother around in the hebrews chapter seven he's laying the point down that what what you're doing right now is what matters your attitude towards christ will make a great impression on what your children will be your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be because the bible said that he would visit the iniquity of their parents upon the children to the third and fourth generation and in genesis chapter 18 the reason he said the reason i make all these promises in this covenant with abraham was because in verse 19 he said for i know him abraham that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him and we'll just stop right there you love the lord this morning amen let's be in great expectation for what the lord has in store for us today and make the lord please with us and our thoughts and our actions this morning you
