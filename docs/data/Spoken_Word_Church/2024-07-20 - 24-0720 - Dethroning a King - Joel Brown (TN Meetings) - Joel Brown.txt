invitation being here and uh the opportunity to uh to bring the word of God and um I express this not out of humility just simply because it it's a reality to me I'm nothing in myself and and I know that you will hear things that you've heard before and quite frankly I don't know of anything else to bring but what I've heard before but what we already know to be the truth and the Bible tells us that we are to be stirred up by way of remembrance to be stirred up because sometimes I know y'all cute folk are here every where I go there's cute folk that think they you know they're better than somebody else but I'll talk to you too but we get complacent Things become common to us oh I've heard that before you know and and I think about this many times we we will give the devil more opportunity to convince us of things he tell us one time one time and we'll go to the bank with it but we hear sermon after Ser message after message and it doesn't sink in what's what's wrong with that what's up with that we're just human we're on our way to Perfection we will get there one day right amen but I want to thank brother Wade for the opportunity to be here and just want to thank brother Andre and the and the Saints there and just love you all and known brother Andre for years and and uh knew knew brother Andre when we were both single save single and searching woo amen amen amen but as I said my queen you know and I was 33 I'll just give a little bit of testimony on myself and and I'm I'm sure we're not in no hurry to go anywhere you folk from Georgia where you going y'all are where you came to be so we'll just have a good time and you'll listen to this old guy talk a little bit just to get rid of my nerves and just set these things aside but but um but it it is it is a joy to to just know the Lord and and to just make friends along the way and when you find out that someone that you meet for the first time you find out that they're family and it's just that way because you know here we are and what's been designated as a youth service and so many times I think about a youth service and and and brother Wade I can't help but to to Really uh I guess position a youth service in in that this way that it's really a service preparing us for the Youth service so whoever the oldest person is in here tonight this service is for you because we are on our way to that place of Eternal youth amen so sis if you're older brother if you're older you will one day get that step back that you once had amen your gate won't be slow anymore because we're going to that place of Eternal youth amen shut up brother Joel and get on with the word amen if you have your adoption papers turn with me the book of Isaiah your marriage certific ific your adoption papers your identity qualifier this word tells us who we are this word tells us who we were this word tells us who we will be send with me the book of Isaiah the book of Isaiah chapter 14 Isaiah 14 beginning at verse 12 Isaiah 14:12 do you love the Lord is it he good do you love his word so if you love the Lord and you love the word you're loving yourself amen right cuz your identity is in him and he is his word that word is in you how are there fallen from Heaven your son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which it weaken the Nations for thou said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will also sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high God this is a little bold character verse 15 yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit amen they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying you mean to tell me this is that one that caused me all that trouble you mean to tell me this is the one that I listen to more than I listen to God himself narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroy the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners his objective is to trap you and keep you and not let you out being a prisoner in your mind alone in your room somewhere that is his objective is to keep you locked up and not let you out not open the house of his prisoners all the kings of the nation ations even all of them lie in glory every one of them in his own house let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your word and as I've said Lord our identification who we are is in this word Lord I want to to learn everything that I can about who I am and I can do that by learning who you are because who you are is who I am lord it's not a tangle of syntax in that we say these things it's simply a reality and so many times we have to give expression to that reality in a way that may be a little curious to some around us and they may not quite understand it but Lord you you you you are pulsating your desire towards your people today tonight in this service and father no doubt there's some sitting here tonight listening to me that's come to this Place Lord they don't know you in a true and a genuine way we just pray tonight that you would just stir Hearts forgive us of our our Humanity oh God and help us to set ourselves aside help us to set this old flesh aside Lord that we can lay hold on to something of Eternal value because we know that this old world is about done as our sister was singing the the saints were singing that song Oh God to being reminded the the signs of the time they're everywhere they're all around us even even the carnal man even the worldly man even the worldly woman sees and feels that something is not right something's off but Lord the reality is something is about to come on and it's called a Rapture so Lord may we lay hold on to those things tonight oh God change us and help us as we walk through this word tonight oh God may it be an encouragement to the people may we be benefited by our gathering tonight and it's in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated but Isaiah gives us some insight into the intent and the purpose of the Devil Himself but a beautiful thing about this this this scripture my thought is that not only does he give us insight into uh the devil he allows us to see exactly what's going to happen to him and we are dealing with a defeated foe he's already it's already done everything that's going to happen has already been done we as mortal beings have to to um capture the essence of God I'll just say it this way we have to capture the essence of God for us as in individuals we we can't so much look at how Mama did it how how daddy does it or or we can't really look at how the pastor does it in the sense of their walk with the Lord we have to capture the inspiration of God what he's pulsating to us as an individual because see the thing is that preacher he may fall by the wayside Mama may say pack up and say I don't want to live this life anymore so you the individual it's important that we lay hold on to God but I as as I have just the the time tonight I just want to take a thought dethroning a king dethroning a king we all know what kings are and of course we live here in America we're Democratic Society we don't have the monarchy and all of that and and in in many places uh around the world the monarchy is really just a a figurehead it's it just a status thing there's no real power it's just something that's been in place for years and people will keep it around and don't we do that in our own lives well it's just comfortable that's what I've gotten used to and my daddy was or my my mama was and you know all of these things and that's what they did that's how they did it but dethroning King and I have to to to give a little bit of caveat here in that the Lord puts me in situations sometimes this little thought it's been rumbling around in my head but I I've never really until just yesterday even it just I was just praying about the service and I had a thought that I'd been working on studying and and the Lord just shifted my thought and and so if this seems jumbled it is but I believe it's what God wants us to hear tonight so I just want to do my best to submit to that inspiration and and and just be able to bring it because I I I I want you to know that that that the pulsation of who I am and what I do in Christ is is I use two scriptures that that give me uh energy and that being the the the woman at the well and the prodigal son because I believe firmly that there are people just as it was with the woman at the well as she did not realize who she really was but yet she was religious and here she was telling the prophet God him the God Jesus himself talking to this man telling him what the word says and hear the word he was the word so she was religious and she knew but she did not know who she was because there was no light to cross her path so a pulsation from within me or or a purpose with that that I try to fulfill is to be a little Illuminator wherever I go to shed light because somebody may not know who they are and the prodigal son is such that there are people that are are have had an experience with home I'll say it that way they've had an experience with home but they've they've they've had a desire to go out and sew their oats and do all these other things things because that's in all of us because we're we're Fallen creatures but yet there has to come a time for that prodigal to realize it's okay to come back home in fact Daddy has been watching and waiting for you to come back home so as I go and do what I do in Christ I'm looking for the prodigal and I'm searching for an opportunity to talk to a woman at the well and it may not look like you do it in fact with Jesus himself they wonder what in the world is he doing talking to this type of woman not just that he's talking to a woman he's talking to that type of woman because sometimes God will put I don't know why I'm saying all this sometimes God will put people in your path they may not look like you they may not smell like you would like them to smell they may act in a way that you may not be comfortable with but if we would submit ourself to love yes and reach out to these people because I'm wanting to get out of here we're not going anywhere till that last one is in and as a prophet talked about if if there's only one in Jeffersonville that's going it's going to be me he had that type of faith and that type of belief so I just borrowed that inspiration of of what he said there and and and I I look at it this way if that last seed is going to be found I'm going to find that last seed because I'm ready to get out of this this old pest house but dethroning a king to remove from the throne dethroning to remove from a prominent or powerful position to deprive of any High position or title to depose or to take away the power and authority of we're talking about dethroning a king we're talking about taking away the power and authority of a power or a source that has so captivated a life that they can't progress further they can't make any headways in in God they come to church after service after service and they hang around Church events but there's just something that won't allow them to move on in there's a king on the throne of their life I'm here tonight to let you know it's time to Dethrone that King Dethrone that King so what what what made a person how did kingship begin and there's so much we could get into and and I don't really have have a lot of time but but but how did kingship begin it it it was never in the the nature of God to to have one man to rule over another right man has done that so how did this kingship thing begin and and what made a person so important were so great that that that they positioned themselves above everyone else and it gave them an elevated position what started that where did that come from because all things had to have a beginning or a Genesis and and one as I was looking at some of this I I found this this little comical uh answer to that question how did kingship begin and this one guy says it this way if you own the farm you own the food which is something everyone needs to survive so that makes you King I'm the big man around here huh I know people like that I just want to take a little bit time let's listen to this this is just one person's uh uh uh uh explanation of of kingship and King Kingdom hood and how it came to be they said essentially just just give me just a moment here there are various models of schools of thought regarding the emergence of leadership class or or or kingship for instance in hydraulic civilizations meaning ones dependent on irrigated agriculture it is assumed that the leadership class were the people who planned the irrigation systems that were vital to everyone's survival as time went on and these cities prospers the leaders begin to assume listen to this the leaders began to assume mystical or mythical qualities which transformed them into priests and eventually God Kings of those societies it's because they had the ability to to keep the people alive you see it so many times in the church these men will build these little kingdoms up and they'll have the people rallying around them if you go away from church and do all of this God's going to where's the Holy Ghost where's the Holy Ghost not that this is why there is a prevalence of Thrones uh having mythical ancestry ancestry which seems to be the Common Thread among all these different civilization me models pharaohs for instance claim to trace their ancestry to Horus an actual God in the Egyptian Pantheon the Greeks have polus uh by which they identified and they insist on having mythological ancestors Athens being named after literal goddess too even modern Thrones tend to have this mythical origin with the Throne of England being mythically entwined with King Arthur so there's a mysticism there's something something strange and odd about this whole kingship and this rulership thing today of course we scoff at such claims but the fact is that kingly Thrones were often entwined with mythology to confer a sense of divine legitimacy to the monarchs so they themselves couldn't fully uh show their legitimacy so they had to tie some deification to it they had to make something uh mythical about it to get to capture the attention of the people and to keep them under their domain and rather Kings emerged from the fusion of leadership classes and a common mythology which effectively created a paradigm that the entire Society Society can agree on as their reality so in instead of finding their own reality they look to this King to be their reality the Pharaoh doesn't just leave because he plans all the infrastructure projects and has an army to kill any Rebels he's the leader listen to this he's the leader because people actually believe he is descended from the gods and to disobey him is to subvert the will of the gods they believe that he was God you tell me what's falling around this mess message thinking that William bradam was God it's mythology it's a kingdom that's not of God y'all just pack that and take it home with you I ain't going to dissect that one I'm just letting you know I don't believe in that nonsense and that's what it is nonsense so as I as I began looking at at this uh history of kingship again studying just traing through some some some things I found it fascinating how uh even for instance like with the Egyptians in particular when when their power structure would collapse time and time and time again there was something about this concept of kingship of divine kingship that was so strongly entwined and ingrained in their societal and cultural DNA so much so that even after it would topple and fall that generation after generation as time went on they would strive so intentionally to go back to that old order and eventually it would be reestablished and as we were looking in our opening scriptures we find out in verse Isaiah 14:13 says for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my Throne so this whole idea and this whole construct of kingship is a demonic construct it comes from the pits of hell so any man that wants to take rulership in the sense of holding the people under his rule his domain he's under a demon Spirit as I said you take this and you packing and take it home with you do whatever you want to with it but if when you look at it for what it truly is people are functioning under a kingship that's that the intention is to take them and make them a prisoner and not allow them to get out it's a demonic construct Luke 10:18 says and he said unto them I beheld Satan as Lightning fallen from Heaven the disciples the 10 disciples that come running back saying praise God we had a Victorious campaign we have all these Devils subject under us Jesus wait wait wait a minute wait a minute Your Glory should be in the fact that you are called that you are in that number that you are truly genuinely his not the fact that you got demons subject unto you from the very beginning it was Satan's ambition and desire to be like God in fact he wanted to be even more than God cuz what did he begin to say I I will I'll do this I'll do that this is what I will do and he was at one time the original Archangel of God think about it he once held the greatest position in heaven outside of God he was God's rightand man to Fellowship so if God was going to fellowship and and talk about some things who is he going to talk to so if he was that close to God then he knew C certain things that nobody else knew huh he was God's rightand man to Fellowship that's what the prophet says and verse 13 look at it it says that in his heart for thou H has said in thine heart he didn't even speak these things out it was something on the inside that he had a secret desire and no doubt some you sitting here looking at me now and you when I mention these kingdoms that are holding you captive this king that's holding you it's stying your growth you probably thought of whatever it was and you begin to to maybe your wife doesn't know maybe your your husband does maybe Mom and Dad don't know but there's something that's holding you back from fully coming into your position in Christ Church it's time to get out of here when that last one comes in when that last one is in maybe they've been sitting on a Pew for 10 20 40 50 years many times sometimes we think that that last one is somewhere across the sea we got to go across the sea no they could be your neighbor that's right next door to you dethroning King but in his heart so he got puffed up in his heart he was the one that wanted to worship he saw all this worship going to God he wanted the worship he wanted the recognition he wanted the power he wanted the authority amen it's a demonic construct somebody that's waned to be the top of everything it's a demon Spirit he simply did not have the character to match the Fulfillment of that ambition that's why it's important for us to stay in the calling and position wherever God is calling whatever he's calling us to do let's be that let's do that with all that's within us you know I can't be brother Andre I can't be brother Wade if I were brother Wade then you'd hear Brother Wade again you'd hear Brother Andre again I want to be who God has called me to be and as I so often have said one of the biggest diseases that that's running ramit within the church is called comparative itis we want to compare ourselves to somebody else who is it that you really want to be like anyway I hope you don't want to be like me I ain't got nothing for you but Jesus Christ that's the best thing that I can give to you that I can show so if you want to be me then stand up here and you Proclaim Jesus Christ you beat Jesus Christ so he simply did not have the character to match that ambition that's why Powers the prophet says apart from character is satanic power apart from character is satanic and we must remember that character is a victory a character is something that that that that that we time after time we get victory over it's not something that we have that we're just giving we have to work toward that 1959 questions and answers so listen to this so Lucifer is on Earth today we think you know he ain't going to bother me bless God I believe Malachi 4 praise the Lord what are you going to do with Malachi 4 if that's how you feel that you've got Malachi 4 then why do you cow down every time the Devil comes your way and you won't do what God is leading and telling you to do bless God I've got Malachi 4 I'm the messenger of the hour well live it be it so he goes on to say so Lucifer is on us today trying watch what he's doing trying to work in the church to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world Lucifer was kicked out of heaven so if Lucifer was kicked out of heaven what ought we to be doing with Lucifer when he comes knock it on our door if he can't stay in heaven he can't stay in here if he can't have a home in heaven he cannot have a home in here he cannot have a home home in my life so what are you going to do with this King what are you going to do with this Kingdom that has established itself in your life it's time to Dethrone that King it's time to kick him out sir so somehow somehow he positioned himself between the angels and God how how did he get such a position how was he able to uh uh position himself in that place and the prophet says it this way and ascended himself above those stars and watch what he did and he preached to them and deceived 2/3 of them so he positioned himself between the angels that he got between the angels and God what did he do he began to elevate himself huh because after all the Angels knew hey this is God's buddy this is God's right hand man so what he's saying probably has some truth to it huh that's that's subtle church that's SLE pre Preachers will take a gift a genuine gift and twist the words that they say to influence the people in such a way that it's causing them to oh my goodness it's a demonic construct it's the Devil Himself standing in the bullpit many times and he preached to them and deceived 2/3 of them he took 2/3 of God's congregation now that's more than half is it not so what was wrong what what happened he had some influence and he was so effective and what he was doing he caused 2third of the angels to follow his Doctrine he did the same thing to Eve so what did he do he obstructed Eve's view he got between Eve and her word so he was he was obstructing what she was able to see which God had already told her you're to look at me you to keep your eyes on me that man I put in your life you to look at him obstructing the view of Eve and he saw what God was doing and said within his heart again I want that that's what I want I want a heaven that's what he was saying in his heart I want an Eden I want a wife I want an eve and he's got him but he ain't got me he ain't got you because even tonight you're learning and hearing about it's time for me to Dethrone that keing let it go I don't care what Daddy did I don't care what that brother did I don't care what that Uncle did amen those scars people are walking around traumatized with scars things that happen in their life and the devil will take them back time and time and time again he's wanting to imprison you in that condition letting you think well I can never get away from that don't care what you did you confess it cuz listen to this confess sin no longer belongs to you once you confess BL it it's not yours anymore and therefore when when when you go to bringing it up to God God says what's that you're saying I I don't understand what you're saying I don't even remember that so if he don't why should I God says what in the world are you talking about remember that confessed sin doesn't belong to you anymore but he was saying I want a heaven I want an Eden I want a wife I want want an eve why because he's wanting to establish dominance and position himself as king I can do it better than God can so what did he do he attacked the mind the intellect of Eve we're familiar with the message the greatest battle ever I'll read some quotes from that message here in a moment but he attacked the mind of Eve and that's where he attacks us the most is in our minds when we get alone and nobody's there he'll begin to to to to Buffet at those things so he brought some intellectual Enlightenment to Eve if he could get the mind he had Direct access to her heart listen to me young ladies some little young I know he's fine he smells good but if that little Shyer don't have the Holy Ghost you better leave him alone listen to me young men if she don't have the Holy Ghost you better leave her alone I don't care how long her hair is it's got those little curls at the end they all the boys are talking about it sir you know but if she don't have the Holy Ghost you better run the prophet talked about a wild stare old cow get a wild stare something wrong with that that something wrong with it you better run while I'm here while that's up I had that to happen years ago I was single y'all I single but I experienced that very thing and of course I was saved single and searching but I I was I I won't tell where I was or anything but I was at some meetings and and and and some of buddies that were with me they they were uh uh they they knew that you know this this sister they were say well you need to get get her number and all all this stuff you know how y'all know how it goes don't look at me like you know what I'm talking about so we were at a restaurant after the service and she uh had got up to go get something out of the car or something and and and they were perect time so I get up you know and go out and you know I think I'll just walk her out or whatever and and and but when we got to the doors to to leave there were two set it's like you walk out of the door then there's a little for you then the door out to the outside and and so you know being a gentleman listen guys being a gentleman that shivy still exists I open the door for her and and and and went through the forer and open the other door and she steps out and and as she goes out she turns back and we're just talking I don't remember what we were talking about but when she turned and looked at me I heard those words that wild St now you either believe the message or you don't you either follow the message or you don't even these little simple you get way off up there in the lofty all these great deep Mysteries but these little simple things will save you from a world and life of hell I did nothing more but excuse myself and I went back into the restaurant never talked to her again nice sis wonderful but Brothers you got to watch that sis she she does not have the Holy Ghost I cannot stress that enough they have to have it if he could get to the mind he had Direct access to her heart and if he has her heart she can easily be swayed by every wind or doctrine every little thing you know getting captivated by his words oh he's so cute and he smells so good and when when when when when a person is in that state when a person is is in a position to where they can so easily be sway by love of course it's always love always love then they will no longer put up a fight they'll no longer remember what Daddy had told them to do or not to do they'll no longer remember what mom had told them to do or not to do or let me bring it on up to the older folk they'll no longer do what the pastor had told them to do they'll no longer do what what the word has told them to do because theyve Fallen Captive to this scene they no longer put up a fight why because Eve was saved why why you know he'll take care of me he'll look after me she had confidence in that because he had gotten between her he had obstructed her view and he appealed to the intellect greatest B ever thought well that's the way it is friend Satan tries to be hypocritical about it he tries to show you something better an easier way a more sensible plan but there is no more sensible plan than that God laid down at the beginning his word hold that word get a grip on it let it get a grip on you so if you got a grip on it and it has a grip on you then you all are united and even when you get weak and you begin to slip he's got a grip on you that will not let go he will never let go of you stay there with it that's the that's the thing the battle rageed when Eve open up her mind to listen to her reasonings huh that's the flu it come in that's the channel that run down her reasoning she in her soul she reasoned her eyes with sight she saw the serpent see taste feel smell hear these are Avenues which we' have been given to contact this realm and the devil operates in this realm so anytime things are appealing to those senses you can probably guarantee it and go to the bank on it that it's the devil trying to influence you in some way her eyes was Psy she saw the serpent he was beautiful handsome far better than her own husband what he was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field and he was probably a fairer man than her husband huh he was he looked like a great masculine Beast standing there how great he was and he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was and the first thing she did she opened up her mind and what she did human reasonings caught it human reasonings caught it there is no reasoning in reasonings in God God says it that settles it that's it there's no there's no there's no reason there there there's there's no time or there's no uh uh uh opportunity that we should take to try to reason God's word am it simply is what it is and what does she say why wouldn't that be a thrill that's that's the thing he does to a woman today some woman with a lovely little husband finds some great big masculine man that'll try to opening up her reasons remember that Satan that's the devil or vice versa man to woman woman to man either way what does he do he works in the reasoning power that conscience where something begins to move through but God gives word the first place so if God gives the word the first place then that's what I want to give first place to is the word of God young people young men young women give God's word the first place give yourself the time and the space and the opportunity to grow and find out who you are in God before you try to attach and pull some little girl in your life you ain't got no job you won't take a bath you won't clean your room and then you expect some little girl to follow you in into matrimony uh-uh uh-uh I ain't got nothing to do with your business but you better hope I don't see something like that I'm going to call you out on it and then I'll take it up with your daddy and mama if they have a problem with me cuz this is the word of God it's what it is a man can't a man can't even come he can't sin Hallelujah here it is watch this he says this is coming threesh FR this is coming fresh a man cannot sin until first he cast aside God's word so there's something already built within the structure of of humans of of humanity that we cannot sin until we cast God's word aside so even though we don't confess the Lord even though we don't live a Christian mind that individual still has to cast God's word aside before they can sin he can't even sin that's disbelief until first he gets rid of the word of God the presence of God he cannot sin Eve could not sin until she laid aside God's word opening up her channel of reasons to her soul and begin to reason so that channel to the soul that's supposed to be the channel through which God contacts the individual that's God's Channel that's God's betting ground but what does human reasoning do it opens up that channel for the devil to come into the very soul of man she goes on to say reason to and begin to reason why certainly my husband's never told me these things but I believe that you he told me I shouldn't do this but you know you make it so real make it so real it's it's you're making it plain to me see there there was the first battle human reasonings these kingdoms it's time to Dethrone this King it's time to topple his throne it's time to take the rulership and jurisdiction that he has in your life dictating how you get up how you go down what you do it's time to Dethrone this King that was the first battle and through that battle has caused every other war and every other Bloodshed that ever come was caused right there at Eden she disbelieved God's [Music] word that first Eve did what she did but this second Eve she's been called to stand in the power of who she is through the message of her day the time that we're living first 2 Corinthians 10:4 says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal they're not reasonings the weapons of our Warfare are are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds so they're Mighty they're made possible how through God not through what you con see not through what you can think of but the they're Mighty through God that's what that word mighty means is made possible through God to the pulling down to the destruction to the demolition of strongholds to the destruction to the demolition of the these Kingdoms in our lives that's preventing us from moving on with God dethroning a king casting down imaginations little Eve you got to cast down imaginations thank you Lord and every High thing that exalted itself above the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ 10 and6 says and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled in verse 5 that word imagination means a reckoning a computation a reasoning imaginations a reasoning such as is hostile to the Christian faith the reasonings that the devil brings are hostile to your walk in Christ right so we got to cast down all these things and having inner Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience that word Readiness means ready or prepared that word Revenge means to vindicate one's right I've got a right to live this life in Christ I've got a right to look the devil in the face and say no not today devil huh I don't I don't care where you've been I don't care what you've done I don't care I don't care what your life is I'm here to Proclaim to you there is a life better and greater than the one that you're living now because the one that you're living now the devil has you so bound and so trapped and even when you come to church you I better not raise my hand they know what I've done it doesn't matter what you've done what's important is what you will do and that's to surrender to that new king that he's knocking he's standing there and he's bidding he's wanting to get in he's wanting to take control of your lives that song many years ago Jesus Take the Wheel in fact I don't want to just take the wheel take my whole car take everything take it all because if I'm in the car and you got the wheel something may happen I may try to get the control of the wheel back again you just take the whole [Music] car so I guess that girl whoever she was she needs to write that song again Jesus car take the bus if if you got a bus if you got a RV worth of of living than Jesus Take It All take full control having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience when your obedience is fulfilled when your obedience is fulfilled when it becomes compliant and submission submitted and compliant to what brother yes when your obedience is fulfilled that obedience and compliance to Christ that obedience and and and compliance to the anointed one is that right because listen youve served the devil long enough you've done long enough what the devil's told you to do you've tried everything why don't you try Jesus I'm not talking about the Jesus that you're used to seeing and the Jesus that you've conceived in your mind and the Jesus that you that you that you so quantify when you come to church or when you see Christian people you say well I don't want to be that I'm not talking about that I'm talking about Christ the anointed word that's who you want to become so when that you you you submitted to Christ the word and you're submitted to his anointed purpose for your life not your neighbor's life that's fine let them do what they're doing what God has called them to do I'm talking about you submitting to what God wants you to do how about that his word and his people doing the very things he did when he was here on the earth so incidentally the the the the Life of Christ has not ceased to be in in in fruition upon the face of the Earth why because there are people that are submitted to that very same purpose and they're doing the same things that he diden you say me brother Joy yes you well you don't know what I did I don't care what you did I've already we've already gone through that it doesn't matter what you did because today tonight today is the day of salvation choose you this day whom you will serve now there's going to be somebody that's going to walk out these doors and they are going to continue to allow that King to be in their lives but I'm here to Proclaim to you today you will not be without a witness that you have the opportunity to know that there is another king there is another ruler there is another Power there is another Force that's greater than that which is controlling you now brothers and sisters submit to that word that anointed word serve that purpose you're miserable you're lonely even though you're surrounded by people you're lonely because you you you're not doing what God is calling you to do oh God dethroning a king his word and his people doing the very things that he did when he was here F the prophet says it this way f i f a i t h in the word of God faith in the word of God and that is an atomic bomb you want to annihilate hell drop an atomic bomb of faith in in the word of God into your situation into your circumstance still the same message greatest battle ever fought let's not use a 22 rifle don't use a 22 a 22 is good for from squirrel picking at your neighbors no don't do that get the cops call on you let's not use a 22 rifle the prophet says let's get an atomic bomb so you tell me how do you go from a 22 to an atomic there's some other stuff in between the 22 in the atomic bomb that could be used but no we're talking about annihilating the Devil Himself let's get an atomic bomb he says let's do the job right how many wants to do the job right then drop that atomic bomb on the devil let let's get God's atomic bomb what is it brother f a i t h in his word not so much even what the preacher says but faith in the word of God because I or some other preachers we may say it wrong or not intentionally but we may say it wrong and it bring a little bit of question mark But if you get faith in this word that's the atomic bomb that we need to drop on the devil that's God's atomic bomb and it blows sickness and Devil's right and left so we look around our lives and we see pieces of the devil all around us pieces of who he wants was and it blows sickness in Devils left and right it annihilates them discriminates oh it's just destroys it disintegrates everything that's ungodly when that bomb of Faith drops in there with the word of God behind it it blows every devil every sickness every disease so we need to take this survey as we're up here flying around in the the heights of this the mysteries of this message of the hour here we are in our big plane and we see that devil in our life we see that devil in our home we see that devil in our in our minds all we got to do is as we're flying over we just press that button and drop that bomb there goes another devil drop an atomic bomb it disintegrates every everything all the scars all the wounds all the bad words all the things that we've done it a disintegrates all of it and God says what are you talking about I don't know what you're talking about because you confess that sin it no longer belongs to you so take it out of your vocabulary don't use that as an opportunity for people to feel sorry for you it's brother Je 20 says Wy Wy W it's time to set those situations aside we're about to take a Rapture Church we've got to stand up in our position as a song says stand in your position and watch the miraculous come into action because our God is tremendous he goes through the fire just to save a sinner amen dropping an atomic bomb the message of token full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the token and nothing else blessed is he that does all of his Commandments he might have a right to the Tree of Life Isaiah 59:16 says and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him verse 174 he put on righteousness as a breastplate now we're talking about dethroning a king and he's not going to give up rulership of that land just say well you believe the message of the hour and well you quoted the mount 4 you quoted this scripture well here you go he going to give it up just like that so you better go in prepare to fight because he himself knows the power that lays within this world right he knows the the ability that this word has to transform and change a life he's not going to give up that territory just simply because you said just because you asked for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and en helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense don't have time to get in all these but verse 1959 Isaiah but so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood and he's coming in like a flood in fact he's already been in your life like a flood but the word of God says when he comes in like a flood the spirit of God shall lift up a standard against him you are no match for the devil you have to have something greater than what you've been using to De on this keing I know you've tried time and time again you goone to Al you moved you cried you sned over the altar but today is the day that you can Dethrone that K you don't have to leave here Bound by that situation you say well I don't want to act like my wife I don't want to do what my husband does you don't have to do that God's not calling you to act like your wife God's not calling calling you to act like your your mama God's calling you to act like you we're not here to impersonate huh we're not here to compare ourselves with somebody else so simply it gets to the point that the individual becomes fed up sick of the conditions surrounding their existence simply get fed up with the the same old thing that these things governing your lives it's time to take action it's time to do something about young people if Mom and Daddy ain't acting right at home I say this a lot I'm going I'm going to to commission you to get down on your knees in in your quiet time and you go to praying you go to talking to the Lord to change the situation of your home if Daddy don't want to do it you do it if mama ain't about it you be the one that's about it my goodness that individual finally gets to the point they says no more will this Tyrant King rule over my life today's the day it's settled I'm dropping a bomb on that situation not just any bomb but an atomic bomb that annihilates everything no Trace Moses's Commission now friends it doesn't take excitement it takes true settled Faith now I believe in Emotion I'm an emotional person I believe in shouting speaking in tongues dancing all those things but it's not that huh because what happens if if like the the Pentecostal people believe that the initial evidence is speaking in tongue what happens if something happens to you have an accident and your tongue gets cut out there goes your Holy Ghost if you believe the evidence of having the Holy Ghost I shout not you should have saw me I was Dan what happens you get an accident and you lose the ability to use you use your legs there goes your Holy Ghost it's something greater than that God doesn't work under excitement watch this God doesn't work under excitement or Screaming or stomping or running you can't Stomp The Devil to make him go out you've got to know right where your understanding and Order him out this right here you speak devil you got to go order him out isn't that right the power of God see that's what it is baal's prophets cut themselves and they jumped upon the altars and they screamed oh baale oh B and Elijah said the god of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that I'm your Ser he didn't scream he didn't shout he didn't jump he simply spoke the word he simply manifested through word the message of his day huh and Elijah said the Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let me know this day that I'm your servant and watch what happens and fire began to fall isn't that right it's the authority of knowing not guessing but knowing the lamb and the dove 1957 and now I'm sure that in this we have found lots of impersonations and and impersonation friend I a person that would impersonate something is the most miserable person that I would know of well maybe if I can just hold my hands just right you know maybe I can just do this when I go up to the Altar and I kneel down I'll do it this way that's impersonator and you're miserable at the altar miserable not repentant but miserable is it isn't it much better just to be yourself the prophet asking question as Congressman Upshaw used to say don't try to be nothing that you ain't well that's pretty good don't try to be nothing that you are not just be yourself and then if you want to be a Christian just ask Christ he will take your old neighbor nature out and put a new nature in then you don't have to impersonate anything so what is he doing he's taking that Old King and he's becoming the new king he's taking the old dominating Force out and giving you a new dominating force not impersonating in it's just your normal life that will living your normal life that you're living not your neighbor's normal life they have their life that's normal to them God wants you to live your normal life because ultimately Saints Satan was trying to impersonate God and what the prophet saying a person that impersonates is a miserable creature the devil think about it he was a miserable being because that's ultimately what he was wanting to do he was wanting to personate God and here we are here we are think about this here he was impersonating and he was wanting uh to to impersonate God he was wanting to become something that he he wasn't able to become and here we are in 2024 and we are becoming and are the very thing that the devil desired did you catch what I just said here the devil was in heaven Desiring something that he could not be and we are that very thing right here today that the Devil Himself was Desiring so why should I settle for something that he's telling me that I am when I have all of eternity to shine and glow and show forth that this is me I am Malachi for you get mad at me if you want to forget William brownon for a minute I am Malachi 4 no disrespect but in fact I'll say this a lot that in malach if you read it it says behold I send you so God identified me before he identified he got my he called my attention to let me know hey wake up Joel Brown I'm sending you something so God has enough confidence in you in me to get our attention so I'm wrapped up tangled up tied up in Malachi 4 why because I am Malachi 4 5 and 6 those carnal individuals are trying to deify the one that was sent they want to make him something that even he himself proclaimed time and time again that he was not even so much so that he said I'm I'm leaving the field I'm stopping preaching why because he carnal individuals trying to make him be something and say that he was something and they're still running around trying to do that same thing today so if Satan would have only waited he was having an identity crisis he was wanting to be something that he wasn't don't try to be somebody you're not sa be who God's called you to be again you say well I can't I can't do it like brother Andre I can't do it like this brother that sister whatever no God don't want you to do that God don't want you to have any type of Crisis God wants you to have that Shalom that rest that peace in him that you can steady and settle yourself as you walk in him but if Satan would have only waited think about it if he had just waited if he had just been who he was he would have the very same thing that I have now invisible Union of the Bride how did you come to do this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous paren he it's no fault of your own by I'm about to close by your natural birth somebody say Amen I'm about to close by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you was born an adulterous you were a sinner to begin with brother me yep show was show is you are centner to begin with your own nature was born through sex desire so you come under that nature I come under that nature so it's in our nature to say bad words it's in our nature to think bad thoughts it's in our nature to do conniving things but there comes a new nature there comes a new king to where that old Nature has to be done away with that that Old King has to die we have to make sure that he is there that first husband has has to die we talk about he has to be graveyard dead not dead just out of convenience I want to put him over here no he has to be dead life has cease have a ceremony for him and everything and if if you want to do that call me I'll come and preach the funeral I'll be glad to preach the devil's funeral if that's what it takes for you to have that service for you to identify that that that the old me is gone we'll bring some saints and we'll shout we'll sing we'll tear the house down praise God my sins are gone they're underneath the blood the cross of Calvary he paid it all what more can he do he's done everything there's nothing more that Christ can do it's simply up to us to believe to have faith in God's word that's right you was deceived into it yeah you you it ain't your fault you never did it listen brother listen sis you never did it because that little germ that was in you listen to the way he says this I love this that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world it's just a little attribute that's trying to declare itself brother talked about the little boy he saw out the man uh the flying the Kite and the man comes by he looks up he don't even see a kite the kite so far up he can't even see it so he asked the little lad he says how do you know what's up there he says every now and again I feel a little tug I feel a little pull so every now and again there's something on the inside I feel a little tug I feel a little pull when I get down when I get low I feel a little something it's my theophany yes it's that's attributes of God trying to declare itself in my life so so so so don't hinder that little pull he's present he's real he's there James 1:2 blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is shot he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord hath promised to them that love him so a king wears a crown huh he has a crown that he wears and he has it that that that signifies to those around him I am the king so the identification that your life has changed when you endure that Temptation when you tried the Bible's clear and it says you shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord haveth promised to them that love him that word Crown simply means a crown a mark of royalty in general an exalted Mark the wreath or Garland which was given as a prize to Victors in public games You See Me Now you see the Saints now but one day they're going to take on a different Visage they're going to have that crown that Victor crown that wreath upon their head metaphorically the Eternal blessedness which will be given as a prize to the genuine

with anyone he is a jealous God but he wants us to love him and he's given us the opportunity to do it he's G us the greatest message on the face of the Earth there is no message there is no other message than this message and I'm like I'm like old brother Willie Ross used to come preach for us years ago was a little B kid you know you probably don't remember brother willly but he'd say I have sold my soul on Malachi 4 and I believe that's true yes and we become Malachi 4 by what by the word of God right by living the word of God let's live this message I always told the the group before pop passed away before dad passed away I said look the greatest gift you could ever give my father is live what he preached the greatest gift you could ever give brother Andre is live what he preaches Brother Richard live what he preaches cuz those are Godly men and they Godly men are given for us to live what they preach and that's the greatest gift you can ever give them you can give them
