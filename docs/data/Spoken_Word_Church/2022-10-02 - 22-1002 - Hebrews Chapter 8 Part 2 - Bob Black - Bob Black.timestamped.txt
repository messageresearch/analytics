[0:00] house of the Lord amen you love going to
[0:03] church this morning
[0:04] come expect it
[0:09] we're going through Hebrews eight let's
[0:12] just go to the Lord in prayer before we
[0:13] get into our studies Lord we're so
[0:14] grateful to be able to gather together
[0:16] this morning Lord and we just ask the
[0:17] Lord that you'll fill our fill our bowls
[0:20] full today Lord and we just Lord as we
[0:22] meditate upon your scriptures Lord we
[0:23] come Lord with needy hearts and we just
[0:25] ask Lord that you'll give us what we
[0:27] have need of granted Lord as we impact
[0:29] these words the the words of Paul orders
[0:31] we're studying these things out Lord
[0:33] that you'll help us to understand in
[0:35] your name amen
[0:38] so Paul was saying uh after he and you
[0:41] know Hebrews chapter 7 he was laying out
[0:43] who Melchizedek was and and uh and
[0:46] talking about those things and so he
[0:48] begins in Hebrews chapter 8.
[0:50] as we kind of looked at a little bit
[0:52] last last Sunday he says now of the
[0:55] things which we have spoke spoken this
[0:56] is the sum we have such an high priest
[0:59] who has said on the right hand of the
[1:00] Throne of the Majesty in the heavens a
[1:03] minister of the sanctuary and of the
[1:05] true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched
[1:07] and not man and in Hebrews 9 just to
[1:10] compare with that scripture he said for
[1:13] Christ has not entered into the holy
[1:15] places made with hands which are the
[1:17] figures of the true
[1:19] but into heaven itself now to appear in
[1:21] the presence of God for us and you think
[1:24] about after Christ died on the cross
[1:25] that he was able to go to go past the
[1:28] veil of his flesh into heaven to present
[1:30] the the atonement that he had made to
[1:33] say it everything that everything that
[1:35] was typed on Earth in the Old Testament
[1:37] now has been accomplished when the high
[1:40] priest and the Old Testament would go
[1:42] once a year to sprinkle the blood on the
[1:44] on the uh The Mercy Seat all of those
[1:47] things were signifying that something
[1:49] was going to come the true atonement
[1:51] that would be once for all that our our
[1:53] spiritual high priest Melchizedek God
[1:57] come down in flesh would come once for
[1:59] all to pay the price and so he entered
[2:01] in
[2:01] and entered into heaven itself to prove
[2:04] that the price was paid so if we if we
[2:07] kind of examine that and I and I
[2:09] apologize I'm trying to get better about
[2:10] my small font but uh so I know this was
[2:13] a lot crammed in but just just listen on
[2:16] this slide and then we'll some of the
[2:18] other slides uh Lord willing will be a
[2:21] better a better sized font
[2:25] oh so his blood you think about what his
[2:27] blood did for us his blood that that he
[2:30] entered into heaven itself to prove that
[2:31] the price was paid for us his blood was
[2:33] the entrance fee to Heaven his blood
[2:35] paid the price for us to go to heaven
[2:37] his blood was the cleansing agent it
[2:39] cleaned cleaned us out so that so that
[2:42] you think we were um
[2:45] on the way to church this morning uh
[2:47] sometimes my wife will read a scripture
[2:49] and she was just reading through the
[2:51] book of Acts about all the things that
[2:52] Paul had done and you think about a man
[2:54] like that that had actually gone into
[2:56] people's houses and Drug them out
[2:57] grabbed them by their coat and Drug them
[3:00] to be and and and and and said I want
[3:02] these people to be killed
[3:04] but yet the blood of Jesus Christ was
[3:06] sufficient to clean all of that and you
[3:08] saw the blood his blood was the cleaning
[3:10] agent to clean all of our past stuff
[3:14] are passed off his blood sealed and
[3:17] ratified the New Covenant what's the New
[3:18] Covenant that the Life of Christ would
[3:20] pay for our sins so that his life could
[3:22] come and dwell on the new in the
[3:24] believer's heart his blood took care of
[3:26] the sin issue once for all
[3:28] and that's in Hebrews 10 and and uh all
[3:32] these different verses in Hebrews 10 his
[3:33] blood brought bought us Eternal
[3:35] Redemption it was the exchange that took
[3:37] our sin and bestowed on us his
[3:39] righteousness his blood made peace with
[3:42] God and that's really what the if the
[3:44] point Paul is trying to make that he's
[3:45] the mediator of this New Covenant the me
[3:47] what is a mediator or somebody that's
[3:49] that's to to bridge the gap and to also
[3:53] say that all these things that have been
[3:55] promised are going to be fulfilled so
[3:57] Christ came to say to to say that all
[4:00] these things that are written about in
[4:02] the Old Testament are going to be
[4:03] fulfilled in in in Christ and into the
[4:06] life of the believer
[4:08] his blood made peace with God his blood
[4:11] undid everything that sin and death ever
[4:13] took ruined or stained his blood gives
[4:16] us confidence to approach God boldly by
[4:18] faith if you have if you if you
[4:20] recognize by faith what God did for you
[4:22] then you it gives you confidence to come
[4:24] to him boldly for whatever your petition
[4:26] is whatever his word says that you have
[4:29] access to his his blood paid the price
[4:31] for that
[4:33] so Paul goes on to say then verse 3 he
[4:35] said for every high priest is ordained
[4:37] to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore
[4:40] it is of necessity that this man have
[4:42] somewhat also to offer for if he were on
[4:45] Earth he should not be a priest seeing
[4:47] that there are priests that offer gifts
[4:48] according to the law who serve unto the
[4:50] example and Shadow of heavenly things as
[4:53] Moses was admonished of God when he was
[4:55] about to make the Tabernacle foresee
[4:57] saith he that thou make all things
[4:59] according to the pattern show to thee
[5:01] and the mouth so what what gifts did
[5:03] this man give he gave his blood he gave
[5:05] his life he gives his life in you and
[5:07] the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the
[5:09] gift that this man gives
[5:11] but uh uh an Earthly priest would would
[5:14] have gifts of things to to offer but
[5:16] this man had his blood to offer
[5:19] in verse six he said but now hath he
[5:21] obtained a more excellent Ministry by
[5:22] how much also he is the mediator of a
[5:25] better Covenant which was established
[5:26] upon better promises for if that first
[5:29] Covenant had been faultlessed then that
[5:31] then should no place have been sought
[5:32] for the second for finding fault with
[5:35] him he saith behold the days come saith
[5:37] the Lord when I will make a New Covenant
[5:39] with the house of Israel and with the
[5:41] house of Judah and we've kind of been
[5:43] examining what that New Covenant that
[5:45] that God's life that he would give his
[5:47] life for us that his life could be could
[5:49] be could live in The Believer the rest
[5:52] of the the rest of of Chapter eight he's
[5:54] actually quoting Jeremiah and we kind of
[5:57] read that last last Sunday said for
[5:59] finding fault with him he saith behold
[6:01] the days come saith the Lord of all my I
[6:03] will I will make a New Covenant with the
[6:04] house of Israel and with the house of
[6:06] Judah not according to the Covenant that
[6:09] I made with their fathers in the day
[6:10] when I took them out of hand to lead
[6:12] them out of the land of Egypt because
[6:13] they continue not in my Covenant and I
[6:15] regarded them not saith the Lord for
[6:17] this is the Covenant that I will make
[6:19] with the house of Israel after those
[6:20] days saith the Lord
[6:22] I will put my laws into their mind and
[6:25] write them in their hearts and I will be
[6:27] to them a God and they shall be to me a
[6:29] people you know that's kind of something
[6:31] I kind of wanted to sit on for a little
[6:33] bit in this in this lesson because we
[6:36] think you know Christ Christ paid the
[6:39] price for us and he made a way for us
[6:42] but the way the the way that he made is
[6:44] for us to be changed there's going to be
[6:46] an effect in our lives if you if you
[6:49] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he died
[6:51] to put all those Old Testament laws to
[6:54] put the effect the essence of those laws
[6:56] Into the Heart of the believer so that
[6:57] they could be lived out
[6:59] so he said to Jeremiah he's quoting
[7:01] Jeremiah and they shall not teach every
[7:03] man his neighbor and every man his
[7:04] brother is saying know the Lord For All
[7:06] Shall know me from the least to the
[7:07] greatest for I will be merciful to their
[7:09] unrighteousness and their sins and
[7:12] iniquities will I remember no more
[7:16] so what Christ did when he died on the
[7:18] cross was he fulfilled the law what
[7:19] fulfilled fulfilled means is is if we
[7:24] could just think about that there's a
[7:25] lot of things that were prophesied and
[7:27] spoken of in the Old Testament there the
[7:29] fulfilled in a lot of different ways
[7:30] there's there's there's things in the
[7:32] Old Testament that um we're looking
[7:35] forward to the day that we're living in
[7:37] like Ezekiel 36 that I'll give you I'll
[7:40] soften up your heart and give you a new
[7:42] spirit and and then give you my spirit
[7:44] that's that's looking to our day there's
[7:46] things that were speaking of Jesus that
[7:49] a virgin shall conceive and how he was
[7:52] going to come and where he would be born
[7:53] in Bethlehem and those kind of things
[7:55] that the atonement will be made
[7:57] so Christ he fulfilled he fulfilled that
[8:01] that there was an atonement going to be
[8:02] made but yet there's there's part of
[8:04] that there's there's things left for you
[8:07] and I to fulfill as well that's why we
[8:09] were we were speaking on as you see the
[8:12] revelation of Jesus Christ unfold you
[8:14] can't help but see the Revelation you're
[8:16] part of that Revelation unfold as well
[8:18] because if you're part of him you got
[8:20] you've got something to do as well
[8:22] that's what you know really what the new
[8:25] test the Old and New Testament is the
[8:27] Old Testament taking that that law the
[8:29] law written on stones and the New
[8:31] Testament put it in the believer's heart
[8:33] so what what it looks like is if you
[8:35] really under get the true understanding
[8:37] of the Old Testament the Old Testament
[8:38] was fulfilled in Jesus Christ and the
[8:41] New Testament is fulfilled in his bride
[8:43] so now you got a picture of the Old
[8:45] Testament as as the groom and the New
[8:48] Testament is the bride and you've got
[8:49] that now you've got a picture a love
[8:51] story coming together so so what uh you
[8:54] know what we were kind of getting in
[8:56] last last time about how the the law the
[8:59] really to really fulfill the law it's
[9:01] it's fulfilled in love well you've got a
[9:04] love story that's being unfolded here
[9:06] you got a love story where Christ died
[9:08] on the cross so that he's bright so that
[9:10] he could be married to his bride so that
[9:12] he could call his bride to himself
[9:15] two two Wings two wings that are are
[9:19] kind of spread out what what really is a
[9:20] picture of a of a bride and a a bride in
[9:23] his in his groom
[9:25] so you think about what the law the
[9:27] Law's got to be fulfilled everything's
[9:29] got to be fulfilled and so now let's
[9:30] take a little quick detour let's go on a
[9:32] rabbit Trail like we did last Sunday and
[9:34] talk about Jesus fulfilled the law but
[9:37] now the bride's going to fulfill the law
[9:38] too how she's going to how she's going
[9:39] to fulfill the law by becoming what the
[9:41] essence of what God wanted us to be how
[9:44] to love your neighbor and to forgive
[9:45] others and to to to be able to love
[9:47] people the way that God wanted to love
[9:49] somebody that hates you
[9:51] so uh and when Jesus was preaching The
[9:54] Sermon on the Mount he said let your
[9:56] light so shine before men that they may
[9:57] see your good works and glorify your
[9:59] father which is in heaven think not that
[10:02] I am come to destroy the law of the
[10:03] prophets I am not come to destroy but to
[10:06] fulfill he's not coming to just scrap it
[10:09] to do away with it but to actually
[10:11] manifest what the law was speaking of
[10:13] for verily I say unto you till Heaven
[10:16] and Earth pass one jot or one Tittle
[10:18] shell and no wise past from the law
[10:20] till all be fulfilled so the whole body
[10:24] of text has to be fulfilled in somebody
[10:26] somebody's going to live it now Jesus
[10:28] Christ was the living when he when he
[10:30] opened up the scroll and read there in
[10:32] Isaiah and identified himself with the
[10:34] scripture he was the living
[10:35] manifestation of what he was reading
[10:37] there so when you read in the Bible and
[10:39] you're you're you also are the living
[10:41] manifestation of the words that you're
[10:43] reading on the page come off the page
[10:45] into living reality so it's all going to
[10:48] be fulfilled and you're fulfilling it as
[10:49] well
[10:50] to fulfill means if you look in Strong's
[10:53] Concordance it says to cause God's will
[10:55] as made known in the law to be obeyed as
[10:58] it should be I see you in the Old
[11:00] Testament they couldn't they couldn't
[11:02] live out the law they I mean they tried
[11:04] to but but the difference is when you
[11:06] got God inside of you God actually
[11:09] living it out it in the essence of what
[11:11] the law means
[11:13] it can can be fulfilled in the way it
[11:16] should be that's that's what it means to
[11:18] fulfill and the Oxford languages it says
[11:20] to bring to completion or reality to
[11:22] achieve or realize something desired
[11:25] promised or predicted
[11:28] you see how there's this idea that um
[11:30] called antinomialism that Martin Luther
[11:33] that's a big word but Martin Luther and
[11:35] John Wesley and all them fought against
[11:37] this idea that when Christ died on the
[11:39] cross that we don't have to live out
[11:41] like the Ten Commandments that there's
[11:43] this idea that people down Through the
[11:45] Ages have have have kind of they've
[11:48] they've thought that well when I since
[11:50] I'm a Christian I don't have to live
[11:53] according to the law anymore I don't
[11:54] have to I can just throw away Thou shalt
[11:57] not kill Thou shalt not steal I have a
[12:00] right maybe to do things in secret but
[12:02] the blood is Jesus Christ just covers it
[12:04] over
[12:04] but you see you don't have to do
[12:06] anything to come to Christ but when you
[12:08] do come to Christ that law will take
[12:11] effect in your members and it will begin
[12:12] to change your thinking and change your
[12:14] doing and change change the way that you
[12:16] work so that you you won't steal and you
[12:18] won't you won't uh do those things
[12:21] there's going to be an effect of coming
[12:24] to Christ that's why Romans says for
[12:27] what the law could not do
[12:29] and that it was weak through the flesh
[12:31] God sending his own son in the likeness
[12:33] of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin
[12:36] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[12:38] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[12:41] walk not after the flesh but after the
[12:43] spirit
[12:44] that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for
[12:46] to fulfill the law in you for they that
[12:49] are after The Flesh do mind the things
[12:51] of the flesh but they that are after the
[12:53] spirit the things of the spirit for to
[12:55] be carnally minded is death but to be
[12:58] spiritually minded is life and peace
[13:00] because the carnal mind is enmity
[13:02] against God for it is not subject to the
[13:05] law of God you mean we got to be subject
[13:07] to the law of God
[13:08] neither indeed can be so then they that
[13:11] are in the flesh cannot please God but
[13:14] ye are not in the flesh but in the
[13:16] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[13:19] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[13:21] spirit of Christ
[13:23] he is none of his
[13:25] now you think about being subject to the
[13:26] law of God but if you go back and read
[13:28] what what the law this is the this just
[13:31] a sample of the 16 613 uh laws that are
[13:36] that are in the mid-site that the
[13:38] probably not pronouncing that right but
[13:40] to know there is a God
[13:42] to have no other gods
[13:44] to know that God is one
[13:47] to love God
[13:49] thank you
[13:51] to fear God
[13:53] and these are all the all the things
[13:55] that are in The Loft they just they just
[13:56] scroll up not not to profane his name
[14:00] see you when you're baptized with the
[14:03] Holy Ghost and this becomes real that
[14:05] you can really do these things to listen
[14:08] and stop scrolling on me
[14:11] to listen to the true prophet
[14:18] well we'll just keep going
[14:21] but see I was just trying to highlight
[14:22] an example that that God he wrote all
[14:26] these things down
[14:27] and in the New Testament the essence of
[14:29] those things in the Old Testament are
[14:30] being fulfilled in US
[14:32] he said and Paul said in in in verse 13
[14:36] He said in that he saith a New Covenant
[14:38] he hath made the first old now that now
[14:40] that which to caith and waxeth old is
[14:42] ready to vanish away
[14:45] so Paul said in second Corinthians who
[14:47] also have made us able Ministers of the
[14:49] New Testament not of the letter not like
[14:53] the letter of the things that we read
[14:54] all these things that we have to adhere
[14:56] to like washing pots and things but of
[14:58] the spirit the essence of the things
[15:00] that are in the Old Testament the letter
[15:02] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[15:05] but if the ministration of death written
[15:07] and Engraving in Stones was glorious so
[15:10] that the children of Israel could not
[15:11] steadfastly behold the face of Moses for
[15:14] the glory of his countenance which Glory
[15:16] was to be done away how shall not the
[15:18] ministration of the spirit be rather
[15:20] glorious
[15:21] so all of those things that were typed
[15:23] in the old tester are now being
[15:25] fulfilled in Us by the Holy Ghost
[15:28] so Christ's sacrifice met every
[15:30] requirement of the law
[15:31] with the Life of Christ and the believer
[15:33] will be a living manifestation of the
[15:35] essence of the law
[15:38] in Mark chapter 12 Jesus said the first
[15:41] of all the Commandments is hear o Israel
[15:43] the Lord our God is one Lord and the
[15:45] second is like this namely Thou shalt
[15:48] love thy neighbor as thyself there is
[15:50] none other commandment greater than
[15:51] these
[15:53] in Romans chapter 13 He said oh no man
[15:56] anything but to love one another for he
[15:58] that loveth another hath fulfilled the
[16:00] law
[16:01] now you think that if true love is
[16:03] Manifest in the life of a Believer then
[16:05] the whole law is is can be summed up in
[16:08] the Fulfillment of that
[16:09] for this Thou shalt not commit adultery
[16:11] Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal
[16:13] Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou
[16:16] shalt not covet and if there be any
[16:17] other commandment it is briefly
[16:18] comprehended in this saying namely Thou
[16:20] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love
[16:23] worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore
[16:25] love is the fulfilling of the law
[16:29] that's a weighty statement that love
[16:33] fulfills the whole law
[16:35] in Galatians chapter 5 he said for
[16:38] Brethren you have been called into
[16:39] Liberty only used not Liberty for an
[16:42] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[16:44] one another for all the law is fulfilled
[16:47] in one word even in this Thou shalt love
[16:49] thy neighbor as thyself
[16:51] and in James chapter 2 if ye fulfill the
[16:54] Royal law according to the scripture
[16:56] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[16:59] you do well
[17:00] you see we're living in the age though
[17:02] where love has been redefined into
[17:04] something that doesn't match what the
[17:06] scripture is we think we use we use when
[17:08] you start talking about love we use it
[17:10] as an occasion to say well I'm not being
[17:11] treated right but if we'll take what the
[17:13] Bible says and examine ourselves and try
[17:16] to match up with that then we can really
[17:18] we'll really see what the essence of
[17:21] What Love Is Love Is Love is to not put
[17:23] yourself above somebody else
[17:25] to always be looking for the other
[17:27] person's benefit to try to reach out to
[17:29] try to be to try to be a
[17:31] to be inclined to see the other person
[17:33] come to Salvation
[17:36] because that's that's where our goal is
[17:38] to to give others eternal life and this
[17:41] age that we're living in has Twisted
[17:42] love around to where you know either
[17:44] even children they don't When Love is
[17:46] being shown to your children you know
[17:47] sometimes they'll say well you don't
[17:48] love me but love is the definition of
[17:51] what love is has been twisted around so
[17:53] that when you try to show love it's well
[17:55] you don't really love me but love love
[17:57] is love is like a where the Bible talks
[18:00] about the prophets would rise up early
[18:02] in the morning and and try to tell
[18:04] people the truth and rebuke rebuke with
[18:06] long suffering because love
[18:08] love wants the best for you
[18:11] love
[18:12] I I maybe maybe just meditate on these
[18:15] things as we as we go through these
[18:17] scriptures and think about what love is
[18:18] hereby we perceive the love of God
[18:21] because he laid down his life for us and
[18:22] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[18:24] Brethren but we need when he died on the
[18:26] cross for for all the Israelites and
[18:28] back then they didn't recognize his love
[18:31] that he was showing to him
[18:34] whoso had this world's good and see if
[18:36] his brother have need and shoveth up his
[18:37] bowels of compassion from him how
[18:39] dwelleth the love of God in him my
[18:41] little children let us not love and word
[18:43] neither in tongue but in deed in truth
[18:46] and then first John chapter 5 he said
[18:48] whosoever believeth that Jesus is the
[18:50] Christ is born of God and everyone that
[18:52] loveth him that begat loveth him also
[18:55] that is begotten of him
[18:57] and by this we know that the love of
[18:59] children of God that we love the
[19:01] children of God when we love God and
[19:03] keep his Commandments for this is the
[19:05] love of God that we keep his
[19:07] Commandments and his Commandments are
[19:08] not Grievous so there's how you know if
[19:11] you love God if you love his word if you
[19:12] love God you'll keep his Commandments
[19:14] because if you love God and that then
[19:16] you're if the love of Christ is in you
[19:19] then you will have a desire to fulfill
[19:21] the law to fulfill the essence of God's
[19:24] word
[19:26] to walk in his word
[19:27] foreign
[19:29] so what
[19:31] some examples of love in the Bible in
[19:33] First Corinthians chapter 10 Paul said
[19:36] let no man seek his own but every man
[19:38] another's wealth everybody when you want
[19:42] to seek seek the the benefit of others
[19:45] instead of your own
[19:46] Hebrews chapter 13 says be not forgetful
[19:49] to entertain strangers for thereby some
[19:51] of entertained angels unaware so so
[19:54] there's love is being expressed in
[19:55] hospitality
[19:57] why because you're trying to get people
[19:58] to Christ
[20:00] remember them that are in bonds as bound
[20:02] with them that's why we have the prayer
[20:04] requests every morning because we're
[20:05] remembering those that are that that are
[20:07] in you know have infirmities and and uh
[20:11] in in bonds of their mind and suffering
[20:15] because the devil's got them in prison
[20:16] in a prison house and them which suffer
[20:19] adversity as being yourselves also in
[20:21] the body marriage is Honorable and all
[20:23] in the bed undefiled but whoremongers
[20:25] and adulterers God will judge let your
[20:27] conversation be without covetousness and
[20:31] be content
[20:33] with such things as you have love is
[20:35] just being content and not comparing
[20:37] yourselves with others and I I you know
[20:40] I like to quote that that say in it
[20:42] comparison is the thief of Joy because
[20:44] when you start when you're not content
[20:45] and you can't start comparing yourself
[20:47] with other than others and that's the
[20:49] devil will take your joy away but just
[20:51] just just be happy with what you've got
[20:55] Philippians chapter 2 says let nothing
[20:57] be done through Strife or vainglory but
[21:00] in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem
[21:02] other better than themselves look not
[21:05] every man on his own things but every
[21:07] man also on the things of others because
[21:10] we want to help one another
[21:12] help one another to
[21:14] to grow up the stature of a perfect man
[21:17] so Lo Romans Romans 13 said that love is
[21:21] the fulfilling of the law brother Ram
[21:22] said in the brass serpent he said God
[21:24] has a law and that law is love
[21:27] then if I love God correctly that I'm
[21:30] going to testify the truth about God if
[21:33] I'm in love with him I've got a wife's
[21:36] here in this building now see what what
[21:38] is it what's this got to do with Hebrews
[21:40] because I was as I talked about in the
[21:42] beginning the Old Testament is the groom
[21:44] and the New Testament it's his wife so
[21:46] it's really a love story
[21:48] so if you love God in the right way God
[21:51] God doesn't have like he's he's trying
[21:52] to make this paint this picture of you
[21:54] don't have to
[21:55] his his wife didn't have to tell him you
[21:57] better not you know sleep around with
[21:59] some women when you're overseas you
[22:01] better not do all this kind of stuff
[22:03] when when it's a picture of love then
[22:05] that everything works in Harmony when
[22:07] you really love one another then you
[22:09] don't have to worry
[22:10] brother said I've got a wife's here in
[22:12] this building God knows how I love her
[22:14] well you know everything good and
[22:16] everything good and everything is going
[22:18] to be for my wife you know that sure
[22:20] just like your husband would be to you
[22:21] now well now if we love God
[22:24] then my confidence becomes perfect in
[22:27] him as I love him and so if you love God
[22:30] and you know that he loves you because
[22:34] you because you can see in his word all
[22:36] these promises that are laying there
[22:38] waiting to be fulfilled then you can
[22:39] have confidence to come boldly to his
[22:42] throne knowing that we've got a high
[22:44] priest and all these promises that Paul
[22:46] laid out for us because we're in love
[22:48] with him and that gives us confidence
[22:50] that he's going to be there for you
[22:52] whatever whatever life throws at you
[22:54] whatever the devil throws at you because
[22:56] it's love love is what gives confidence
[22:59] now he can't break that law of Love see
[23:02] because it's in my heart so now that
[23:04] means that even when you fall and make
[23:06] mistakes
[23:07] you've got a love relationship you
[23:09] you're in love with God and you know he
[23:11] loves you you have confidence that he'll
[23:13] forgive you of your sins
[23:16] so Paul goes on in verse in verse 1 of
[23:19] of chapter nine he said then verily the
[23:21] first Covenant had also ordinances of
[23:23] divine service and a worldly sanctuary
[23:26] for there was a tabernacle maybe the
[23:28] first wearing was the Candlestick and
[23:29] the table and the showbread which is
[23:31] called the sanctuary
[23:34] and after the second Veil The Tabernacle
[23:36] which is called the holiest of all which
[23:38] had the golden sensor in the heart of
[23:40] the Covenant Ark of the Covenant
[23:41] overlaid roundabout with gold wherein
[23:43] was the golden pop it had Manna and
[23:45] Aaron's raw that budded and the tables
[23:47] of the Covenant and over at the
[23:49] cherubims of Glory Shadow and The Mercy
[23:51] Seat of which we cannot now speak
[23:52] particularly he's talking about all
[23:55] these things where shadow of the reality
[23:57] that we have access to now that is being
[24:00] fulfilled in our lives all of these
[24:01] things the golden sensor and the pot of
[24:03] manna and Aaron's raw that budded were
[24:06] symbols of the Christ Living in us to
[24:09] fulfill his word
[24:11] because in verse 8 he said the Holy
[24:13] Ghost is signifying that the way into
[24:16] the all of those things are represented
[24:17] the Holy Ghost
[24:18] that the way into the holy holiest was
[24:21] not yet made manifest while as the first
[24:24] Tabernacle was yet standing which was a
[24:27] figure for the time then present in
[24:29] which we're offered both gifts and
[24:30] sacrifices that could not make him that
[24:33] did the service perfect as pertaining to
[24:35] the conscience
[24:37] but Christ being coming high priest of
[24:39] good things to come by greater and more
[24:42] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[24:44] that is to say not of this building
[24:46] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[24:48] but by his own blood he entered in once
[24:52] into the holy Place having obtained
[24:54] Eternal Redemption for us this is blood
[24:57] that paid the price
[24:59] for the blood of bulls and ghosts and
[25:03] the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the
[25:04] unclean sanctify to the purifying of the
[25:07] of the flesh how much more shall the
[25:09] blood of Christ who Purge who through
[25:12] the eternal spirit offered himself
[25:13] without spot to God Purge your
[25:16] conscience from dead works to serve the
[25:19] Living God
[25:22] to serve the Living God he wanted he
[25:25] wants to change us from you know what
[25:27] dead Works dead works is looking at
[25:29] those Old Testament rules Old Testament
[25:32] laws is like rules and regulations you
[25:34] have to follow without your heart being
[25:37] changed something that you look at and
[25:39] say well if I can just act this out and
[25:41] and just be a good pharisaical actor
[25:43] then you met the requirements and we'll
[25:46] we'll we'll we'll close on this
[25:49] in Mark chapter 7 he said he answered
[25:51] and said unto them well I thought well
[25:53] hath Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites
[25:55] and as as it is written this people
[25:57] honored me with their lips but their
[25:59] heart is far from me I'll be it in vain
[26:02] do they worship me they were worshiping
[26:04] according to what they thought the law
[26:05] required by you know doing things just
[26:07] with an outwardly appearance and washing
[26:09] pots and
[26:10] you know he said teaching for Doctrine
[26:12] is the Commandments of men for laying
[26:15] aside the Commandment of God you hold
[26:16] the tradition of men as the washing of
[26:18] pots and cups and many other such things
[26:20] like you do and he said unto them full
[26:23] well you reject the Commandment of God
[26:25] that you may keep your own tradition
[26:28] and in Matthew chapter 23 as the
[26:30] musicians come forward he said woe unto
[26:32] you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[26:34] you make clean the outside of the
[26:36] coupling of the platter but within they
[26:38] are full of extortion and excess without
[26:41] blind Pharisee cleanse first that which
[26:43] is within the cuff and platter that the
[26:46] outside of them may be clean also God
[26:49] wants to change our conscience our
[26:51] thinking from dead Works to a living
[26:54] reality filled by the Holy Ghost
[26:56] quickened so that the law is actually
[26:58] being manifest in our members and how is
[27:00] it may manifest through love because
[27:03] love is the fulfilling of the law when
[27:05] you love God through the baptism of the
[27:07] Holy Ghost and you love one another
[27:08] you're actually fulfilling all the old
[27:10] things that were prophesied in the New
[27:12] Testament and you become a living
[27:14] walking Testament of those things that
[27:17] they can only probe
[27:18] a little stop there God bless you
[27:24] [Applause]
[27:36] [Music]
