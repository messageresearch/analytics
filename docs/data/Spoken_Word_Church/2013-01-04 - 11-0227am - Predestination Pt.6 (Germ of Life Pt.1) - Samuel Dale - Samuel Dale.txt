in jesus name amen ephesians 1 we'll begin reading in verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will through the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace we're in he at the bounty toward us excuse me in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated now if it means that you have attained an inheritance it means you didn't have an inheritance something had to happen to where you could attain right in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now brother joe read off ran off some things uh that one too he read awesome things about healing and the scriptures and the things you know and uh so you know just take these and and look at it and see about it but i gave him a couple of quotes from brother branham that you know i had picked up the other day and this is off with the message god has a provided way preaching 1954 404. he talked about david said thy word have i hid in my heart oh lord david hide god's word away in your heart and then god will keep that word and i watch it god has to keep his word god doesn't have to heal to prove his power right but listen but he has to heal to keep his word all right now that's something isn't it right you don't have to prove nothing right he's gone but he's but when he what he speaks he's obligated to his word so are you and i obligated our word and then the message of greater than solomon is here 1962 725 going all the way down he's put talking about praying he says i know you don't have to heal to prove yourself you heal to fulfill your word amen now god's obligated to his word that's why the prophet said if you can find it and call god on the scene he said if he won't keep his word then he lied right and that's pretty strong so then what do we do we take the word down into our heart we believe it we stand on it and we say by stripes i'm healed and then we just keep moving right on and uh you know don't worry about it sometimes brother said god will be testing us all right that's no problem he'll be testing us and trying us to see if we'll hold on that's no problem at all it's just the fact that we say by strikes i'm healed and if you can say it by revelation by faith then you don't have to worry about it at all because it's already a finished product now we're running out of prayer claws so we can take this handkerchief and i want it uh passed among everybody and it's not one i've used now it's a new one so don't get afraid and refuse to take it and but just take it and pass it to everybody in the building and let everybody just say a simple prayer over it then we'll bring it back up here and we will uh use it and cut it up for for our prayer claws we had used up the we had the the pulpit part that we changed the stuff you know and up here and we're down to one but uh you know i really like that because there's a lot of prayers went over this pulpit and we cut that up and and sent it out like that but we appreciate it all right now we were cut we're covering predestination okay now the prophet of god said that there's messed up doctrines about predestination but said there is a true doctrine of predestination now that way then we want to find out what the truth is uh we may have our own ideas you know but remember our ideas is not worth anything it's what he said is what matters then when we study what he says then we can come down to the point of understanding and paul said that we were predestinated all right so then we shouldn't be worrying about the the part of doing it and what i've been trying to do with this is message number six and i spent four services on the foreknowledge of god the showing that the prophet of god showed it the bible showed it uh you know that there was a foreknowledge right but not that god predestinated by his own desires because he desired that everybody be saved that's right all right but that he knew by his foreknowledge that there would not be everybody in the world would not accept him so then he could go ahead and write the names in the book of life and in doing it that way by foreknowledge of what exists upon earth in foreknowledge the then the thing formed as paul said can't say why did you form me this way because you know he didn't he predestinated by what he looked down and saw all the way through and i like the way the ones that i gave them to you and you know i i like the point of what he said on the message we've used it i don't know how many times already but uh there's about five on this one where brother random says and this is on e6 of jesus rose 56 405. he said predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to destination right now as i told you i'm just honest you know if that was me i would have said it right backwards i would have said that predestination was first and then for knowledge but see he says predestination looks back to foreign all right so that foreknowledge comes before predestination that's sensible now if you said it right backwards you might have a point to argue about uh of your discussion but you have no point so you have to agree that foreknowledge is first then predestination comes into view to determine the destiny because of the foreknowledge and then he said on paragraph 166 ephesians parallels joshua now i didn't give you these in the notes today i just wrote them back home preaching 1960 515 to evening service he said election he starts all saying predestination he said election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to destiny all right so then whatever you're dealing with if you're dealing with predestination if you're dealing with election uh those things then remember that you're going to be looking back to foreknowledge so for knowledge would be first all right and that way then uh there's no problems because god deals by foreknowledge all right but now we know too that there are some other things about predestination that must be covered and i gave a kind of an overall view or just a run through wednesday night and if you missed that when i asked you to listen to it two or three times you know not because i preached it but because i believe it's the truth of showing where we're going and what predestination is and and the things that we are but i'd like for you to let's just take a an old testament example so if you would go back into in deuteronomy and let's pick up an old testament example and then we'll continue on with our thought you know of what we've been trying to say then because the predestination now elections or whatever you want to do has to look back to god's foreknowledge as i said now if i was saying it i'm just honest i don't mind making statements like this because if i was saying it i would turn the thing around because it would look like it would come out better to our old doctrines well you know it ain't nothing i can do because god foreknew that i'd be this way like i told you my brother submitted this preacher he said god made me a sinner he can't condemn me for being a sinner i said i'm sorry this is when i was in a baptist church i said according to the bible he didn't make you that way according to the bible you made yourself that away you had a choice you didn't have to go that way well if he saw my choice and predestinated there ain't nothing to do about it well he saw what you do so you're the one who's doing it so you can't argue with god in his infinite mind because he knows everything all right then if he knows everything and that's the point i've made to emphasize that the basis of any doctrine in the bible whether it be marriage and divorce whether it be the birth new birth whether it be uh serpent seed whether it be predestination whatever it is if it's not based upon the fact that god knows all things that's right then what kind of a doctrine would you have so you can see that's where mankind didn't base it on that had they based it upon that they would not have come up with their ideas all right same way of the people of the message see they wouldn't come up with the ideas of of what this is you know and and what i come here with and what this was and all uh i believe what the prophet says but i don't believe what man has interpreted it to be saying right you know but that's that's their business i don't preach out there i preach here anybody else listening to it on internet you're welcome to check it out and i've always said if you see me wrong send me a note to a man the other day i've always said i wouldn't answer any questions i won't i will not get into a debate on the internet period right but a man sent me a note the other day from somewhere and he asked where did brother brown say so and so and well i sent him back a note of where he said it i'll do that because if it's in question of what brother brown says i'll be glad to tell the people where he said it out but i'm not going to argue with nobody that's that's beyond my point but look back in deuteronomy the 7th chapter and let's just pick up a thought and think about predestination in in a respect that will take us you know not beyond foreknowledge but will get us back to the point because now here's you know i like to say things like this whether you agree with it or not that's your business but this is just the way i think i'm human so if we're dealing with foreknowledge all right so then that means there had to be something prior to the foreknowledge oh my gosh right because how would it be for knowledge if it wasn't something prior to foreign don't you believe that god existed amen before he began to tell us anything about his poor knowledge he existed the prophet said he existed alone but said he had his attributes right now and he said if we wasn't in him then we never will be right but there's only one form of eternal life see then we want to come down and try to use quotes out of text like saying well you know um we bypassed the word i'll agree with you amen we bypass the theophany i say amen that's what the prophet said but now he said if you wouldn't end the word in the beginning you never will be in the word now those two's got to come together right right so what did we bypass we bypass not coming that away right right that's simple we didn't come into the world that way but jesus did right amen he didn't bypass his theophany that's right but theophany is a word body right but you and i bypass the word body you know we didn't stand out there people jesus did because he was the creator amen whatever you want to make him because he was the son of god to create our and all was created by him but you see we didn't stand out to earth peoples you know that's what everybody wants to make it's something that we was great back there not knowing that that's the mormon doctrine of pre-existence but yet see we want to make it some idea of our own and if that's what you believe that's up to you that's i'm not a corrector i'm just a preacher you know and i just preach what i believe and then what everybody wants to take on it i don't try to convince my wife for what i say you know what i expect her to have the holy ghost to believe and accept it and study out the message for herself because see that wouldn't make it my children or whoever what it is but now listen see then if it's true then then there was something that was or whatever what would be the words you would call it i don't have an education so i don't know how to make those great theological statements that are so perfect what would it be that would be before foreknowledge it would mean that someone had to exist back there to have a foreknowledge so he would have to exist to be able to talk about full knowledge is that sensible it is to me now you know so then maybe we need to study on that comparison some to find out what we were before the world and where we were and what was going on and you know but we could we have to still keep it to the point that when we would come into the world that his foreknowledge would would know all about it and could predetermine all of it you know and know whatever that they would ever bat it's high etc you know and uh knowing that then he would be the infinite god that could look all the way down through and give everybody an opportunity i i gave you the quotes because that was what the man asked me about where was it that that cain was offered salvation well brother branham gave it and i gave you the scripture there work said it to him he said wouldn't you not been chosen if you'd have done what was right but see we look at it like cain was serpent seed he never had an opportunity judas was serpent seed he never had an opportunity but i'm a seat of god well how did you get that right i'm gonna go ahead and say it you can do what you want to with that arrogant attitude i don't know where that's in god that's right right am i right because i don't see that in god now i see it in me and you but not in god but now let's take an example to try to show because we're going to be dealing with the germ of life the germ of life is what we're going to be trying to deal with today in the message and uh you know if we can see what the germ of life is then maybe we can see something about this for knowledge predestination uh you know the things of god because i don't believe god now i'm just telling you i don't believe god just thought this thing up and throwed it out and said i'm just going to create man now i gave you a couple of quotes where brother branham said that that's not correct that people would say and my brother samantha's preacher he says that you know that god is you know to the point that he just haphazardly and doesn't know a thing because if that's true the then we would we would be greater than him that's right all right and see i i don't believe we are but i want to use examples to show you to to try to understand how that we could be a backdoor before the world in god but in the correct way and it not be some haphazard thing that he happened to think we was good enough you know that's man's ideas you know and and you know and it's certainly not pre-existence of peoples right because it is you'd go contrary to the prophet on it right but i do believe in pre-existence right but it's only in god amen all right now we can come down from there we can come down and find out that god wasn't just as i say he didn't just make this thing and just throw it out and say well i'll just create a world i'll create people and and and maybe somebody will accept me as their savior because brother random i gave you a couple of quotes on that he said god don't do his business like that to just throw it out you know just make it that way you know no he knew exactly before the world what was going to take place the fall didn't pull anything over on god he knew that if he created us as human beings that we would fall is that true then if we could he could go ahead and and and bring it the way that he would want to bring it to bring him honor and glory all right so now let's take an old testament example deuteronomy 7 let's go to verse 6. just say reading because it's talking about the children of israel and telling them when they would get into the promised land and the things and they were separated people et cetera et cetera all right listen to what it says start with verse six well let's go verse five but thus shall ye deal with them see going into the land you shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their their graven images with fire for thou art and holy people unto the lord thy god now who's he talking to israel right all right for thou art and holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god has chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth now what did he choose by verse 7 god did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were in number you were in number than any anymore excuse me in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep his oath which he had sworn unto his fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage among men from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt all right now we know then that what is happening god didn't choose israel because there were greater people fancy people nice people good whatever right no no there was just like everybody else but he chose them as a natural nation all right now a whole nation we're not don't get too far don't go over above me just stay with me and listen they were natural people and these natural people were the natural descendants of abraham right all right because then thy seed right all right they were abraham's descendants and god chose them as a nation and they're still right now in the land of israel a chosen nation of god and the children of abraham right all right now but he said i didn't choose you because of some thing or something i chose you because of the oath i made now we want to go to the oath of of the bases of abraham and his um lineages and things and you know saying that in thy seed and all that and that's right now but i want you to go a little bit further with me and think about it what kind of a natural oath i mean he made a natural ode to the natural people but at the same time that god made a natural oath with a natural people he made a spiritual oath with a spiritual people right all right to abraham not as to seeds as of many but it was unto isaac right right now isaac would be the promised son in the natural all right so now i'm trying to get you to see something of how god does things right so then there was a natural people out there all descendants of abraham right all right they were given the land of canaan to go into and had they not done wrong they would have not even had to fought a battle or anything you know and and all of that because the promises of god but yet they prove what they were and done what they did and and they goofed up you know so they wound up with troubles but still irregardless god gave them the land of canaan to be able to go to a natural people to go to a natural land right all right are you with me yeah see but at the same time that's what it's talking about that sworn oath is it was it just abraham because even to abraham it was not unto his seeds no right the natural israel the land to give and canaan was to his natural seeds all right but yet he was speaking of something to come and as he did then he would look down and see and and he would say in isaac is the promise all right so now isaac was a special chosen out of all of the children of israel and out of all of these children of abraham and he had a good meaning and uh you know out of all that isaac was chosen we could go into adoption etc and go on but that i'm just trying to hold it to a point to see all right so then we got to look at it as being one thing the natural seed of abraham was predestinated right that they were going to the promised land and no matter how much they sinned that didn't stop the promise of god they made it to the promised land sure a lot of them died everything happened yes but still they made it the natural seat of abraham made the promised land but see at the same time god was dealing with abraham to get him to see that isaac would be the one right i mean all right now if isaac would be the one that would be chosen then he's chosen above all the others that's right all right now what would that be especially when we'll get to it in a few minutes and see but especially when all of them were the children of abraham right i mean but yet one was chosen right now because he was a good guy no not too good abraham gave his wife away once i think and isaac gave his way twice i think that's according to scripture so he's not too good of a example but that's not exactly what the thing was because we know that it was not unto abraham's natural seed that the promise would literally be coming to that would give them the land they're there now the natural seed of abraham is in the land of israel and that's fine and they will be a millennium with israel as a nation they will be all kind of things true and they will have a place but yet out of that there was a chosen one that was his name was isaac right all right and then isaac would come forth the point of being worded it would finally say in galatians 3 16 it would say that not seeds as of many but unto thy seed not isaac but thy seeds which is christ all right now christ then according to brother branham and the scriptures and things we look at i gave it to you super sign number one on your notes christ is actually the seed of abraham christ is the seed of abraham right so you know you're not dealing with natural genetics so isaac was only a type that's right because he was really speaking of what was the reason that he chose isaac get the point he chose isaac for one reason right now then the seed of abraham being christ that's where the choosing is at he's in christ okay i gave it to you on confirmation evidence 62 there not as deceived as unto many and that's galatians 3 16 see but unto thy seed which is christ now as i said it now keep it correctly isaac was chosen to represent that right so in isaac you can see christ you don't see it in all the others see but they are the children of abraham amen but it is isaac you see it beginning to appear what god's plan was to do was to choose even above his now listen because you didn't listen while ago you surely missed this then the choosing would have to be or what would be taking place would have to be not just that god had a foreknowledge right that would determine the israelites in their position but that god would show in isaac the seed now we'll get to it i mean the seed of god is the germ of life but this hole with me now god then by foreknowledge would see the earthly position all right and what would take place on earth all right but at the same time you see what's taking place on earth in the natural israel you see something transpiring that is going into more of a supernatural realm that god would choose isaac now it definitely is not that all the others were serpent seed i wish people could get all of that garbage out of trying to find out where you separate seed or not it wouldn't matter to me but because i have a new birth it wouldn't matter to me if i run my dna back and found out i was exactly from that big old beast standing in the garden that wouldn't have a thing in the world to do with me why because the new birth takes care of it that's right let's see we get all of that ideas you know oh great look boy come down and you can run it and you can run your genetics you can run your dnas and you can oh yeah but what about the bible don't you think isaac was a direct descendant of abraham right why would he be chosen though above all the others that were direct descendants of abraham right see i like what you think you know my people will stir you up make you emotional and make you so happy and you just feel so good you go home like what do you preach i don't know why i couldn't tell you what he preached i asked the person one time what certain brother believed about the soul she said she's been going there about six or eight months i said why did he preach on that she don't know ain't never any preach on i thought six or eight months and appreciate never preached about the soul of god or her soul or whatever you know i thought it's you know but now listen what i was trying to get you to see this past wednesday that god by foreknowledge knew who would come into the world and who would want the truth all right now and who would be the called of god because many are called but only a few are chosen that's right amen and see who would walk in the truth of god of each hour or age as we'll get to it in a minute and then at the same time he would predestinate as he did the seed of abraham all right so then he predestinated a seed in a abraham brother i said he was that seed right and then he predestinated that same seed in isaac but yet he didn't predestinate it in the rest of them now come on this foreign don't worry about it see then we can see that there was a predestinated seed because i believe that those true children of god now the true ones in the old testament had the seed of god in them just the same as you came with it right and i will repeat that over and over and over they had the seed in them just as you came into the world with a seed in you amen now we got to find out what that is then because if we don't find out what it is we're going to run contrary to foreknowledge and we're going to run into god choosing the wrong way then we're going to make god a respecter of persons and he says he's not all right but if we can look back there and see that seed come down through the old testament then we'll be able to see how that the bride of christ which is the true seed of abraham that's right all right and that is christ that's right and how she comes predestinated because the prophet said what 154 church age book and many times i need to give it to you he said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god but the word our seed the predat the person comes predestinated by four knowledge but a seed is predetermined before the world to ever be he said well then you're making god a respect for a person no i'm not i'm making god exactly what he was right because then he give everybody an opportunity i'll get to it branham i gave you the quote here the other day where brother and said moses was born with that great gift in him he said so was every person that was ever born into the world what makes the i don't like to say african hot and todd a lot of time because we got so many here that come from over in the african vicinities but that's just a word but what makes it to be that you could go over there and find that people they know nobody they they've never seen nobody yet they're worshiping what causes that right sure it may be an animal it may be a a totem pole it may be a whatever but they're still worshiping right right that's right because man is born i don't care who you are where you are who you're born to you're born with a soul which is a moral obligation to do good and want to worship your maker so we'll get back to those later all right so just don't run off too far all right so he he predestinated the seed to come eternally now wouldn't you agree that jesus was a predestinated seed amen that's right i mean surely you agree with that but you know even my brother submitted this preacher he said i believe jesus is predestinated right straight from god but said everything else i don't believe it it's just throw it out there well if you're going to believe he is why can't you believe everything all right now let me keep on reading we see that the natural nation of israel the people of israel were chosen above all of the people of the land to be a chosen people a special people like rabbi richmond said i didn't make this choice he chose me well you know we'll find out it's all choosings in god because we've done covered it and where we've been talking about there in ephesians were that we were predestinated in him right right now so we foreshow all things of seeing the people but at the same time he would be looking down at us the seed that would take his natural start now don't mess me up over on genesis and adam and eve and all of that just get with the world around him because you know how he covers it that it would begin to appear in what would be called the seed of abraham which we know is by faith right see all right it would come out into isaac but isaac would only be the natural predestinated but at the same time isaac would be receiving that seed becoming that seed because it would come true from abraham and abraham would have the seed which is christ all right we keep tying it back right see all israel was predestinated before knowledge but at the same time there was a chosen people who would be the true seed which would be the christ follow the line all right now so then we then we see that predestination did not just start with the bride of christ at the day of pentecost that's where most people would started that with the right of christ on the day of pentecost i mean the predestinated seat and they would start it on the day of pentecost i don't i look all the way back there and see it start in genesis a predestinated seed amen no come on that would be the eternal seed of god our word now here's where we got to hold a good point now but because a person comes with a seed in them doesn't make them eternal at the time the seed has to be made alive right amen before you can talk about it all right so if it doesn't have as we'll get to it again in a minute if it doesn't have the germ of life what good is any seeds you plant in the ground brother brown talked about how they had taken that and and made a grain of corn that looked identical and they could brine it up make corn flakes cornbread everything he said everything would be perfect only one problem no germ of life see so now watch it as we try to get to it now every how that they were the seed of god chosen of god the christ will have to be the way that we are chosen of god the seed of god because there's only one christ it's not a christ of the old testament the christ of the new there's not two or three gods there's only one now watch it now as we get to that see then in the church ages now everybody understand what i use the old testament as an example all right do you understand it what it's using see that you see a natural nation chosen of god but you see a spiritual people which would be the seed which is christ coming through isaac coming down through there all right then you'll see why that god would tell who wasn't jeremiah said i saw you before the world and ordained you right now if the bible is right and we've kind of believe it is it said gifts and callings of god are without repentance so then br gifts and callings of god we'll get to it one of these days brother brown said gifts and college are predestinated right amen right predetermined amen because that's god doing it that's not man he said well then that ain't giving the person a choice no because he knows when we get here he gives us a chance all right but follow me now so we see now in the church ages coming down now we would see a people now listen to my wording who would claim to be the people of god yeah down in the church ages now over the new birth and 9 they would claim to be the people of god and would actually accept jesus christ as their savior and be part of a religious system of each age right all right now watch but did god accept them that's it now brother around said you can accept god all you want to do but he said if god didn't accept you that's right see you don't choose him he chooses you amen if he don't accept you you're not accepted i don't care how religious you are right like i was trying to keep referring back to the pope that wrote that decree that it was better to kill people to make them serve god than it was to let them go the holy ghost brought around and said tried to come upon the man that's right you go read your prophet's message there's a lot in it so it's not just well i believe in this that's right 40 something years we or at least know a little bit about the message amen all right now watch see the organizational system that existed in each age claims to be the people of god and they claim like the children of israel they claim see over here because of being they claim that they're the seed of abraham by the new birth the ice raised up those back there claimed to be the seat of abraham by natural in the religious system people claim to be christians you know all right they claim like the children of israel that they are the seed of abraham see by the new birth all right now here's what gets the churches in trouble if you'll notice your scriptures hey what makes the denominations prostitutes you know and he calls them and prostitutes and said what makes that right because they claim they have a husband and any woman that claims a husband should not be running around with somebody else right see what the denominations you know and the people and all like that organizations we i'd rather make it because we know it didn't develop so bad until it come on down to the last age but see when they when you turn down the word of god i don't care how religious you are you become an organization right one person or millions it doesn't matter you become an organization but when you're still saying god is my husband and you're out committing adultery then god will judge the organizations and you and i right along with if we have the same idea right as prostitutes right because we claim he's our husband we see he doesn't claim to be our husband right he accepts no organization right look your words have he accepts no denomination no no he doesn't do it see so people are saying i've got the new birth and i'm the chosen i'm the seed of abraham by faith which is christ ain't no bad just gonna get up and say hey we're all lost and dying going to hell and you're serpent seed and i'm i'm messed up and we're all now right come on all around the world today people are preaching how that telling the people in their congregation how they're going to heaven right and even telling a lot of them to go into heaven no matter what they do right see that's organizations all right now watch what i'm talking about as israel was an organization but out of israel came a chosen of isaac christ coming on down to the prophets etc then down through the church ages you would see the organizations developing from even the truth and going off and denominating and dying but all that time god still had a chosen seed a predestinated chosen seat now see the natural seed of abraham showed dirt colors by like the situations like the golden calf right yeah you know uh the red sea the the they're doing the things so they showed their colors you understand what i mean showed their colors they showed what they were they showed they were not that seed because of what they'd done see down through that church ages then you see that the church system shows their choosing of their colors because they go not after god's word they go after their own doctrine so then they have the serpent seed i didn't say they were circumcised naturally you and i were born under that system and just as much serpent seed as cain was right because i don't look at it natural i look at it spiritual but still god gave cain an opportunity so has he gave every organization an opportunity come into this day and i think it's really shocked me when brother brown made that statement during the 50s he said the badness has just now become a denomination well i can calculate back that was a couple hundred years ago you know or something 100 years for them he said they'd just now become a denomination why because he was giving them all the change god gave every organization there was in the world every denomination church god church christchurch baptist men especially when this prophet came he went to the world and god was offering it to everybody right not a group not a jeffersonville people only they're all over the world amen he went to them denominations and preached his heart out often listening to him last night where he said he went to a church he said god had showed me that church was system that people are was floating away and that's when he preached uh once more lord and see he done that deliberately god seemed there to preach those people to try to pull them back on the way they were going see they really become denominations when they turned down this message right and not if they didn't denominate and die before they know but it showed their colors you understand all right now see then there was a true saint of abraham that stayed with moses all right see we're jumping across now so we could turn this through seed a true seed of abraham or the seed of christ which stayed with moses and now you'd have to admit moses was that seed or had the seed or whatever you want to bring up your words though but see joshua and caleb showed their colors because i believe it was spoke about caleb said he holy father the lord down through the church ages now you see the the little seed of god that sprang up out of every church system and wholly followed the lord in the best they could do until god was pleased to dwell they're with them even in the days of luther and everybody wants to draw that candlestick thing out you know and say it's alpha and omega would you better read your bible and you better read the prophet he said he's in the midst miss means god was right there with the lutherans that was the seed of god for the time that was christ all right right now let's see what your prophet had to say on it all right i just want to prove a couple of points to you because i like to do that and i read it to you so look at number three i mean number you don't have to look at them now because i got one and then you know when i add in uh last night i added in another whole page and a half so i go 2a 2b 2c two three hey you know i don't know how i go because i don't want to erase all my numbers and start over again all right so look at number two a and just get what's there in the line and then don't worry about the rest of it you'll find wrote around him in 154 of the church age book he's talking about how that it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god it is the word or seed all right he said way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the eternal god with eternal thoughts decreed and decree jacob have i loved but he so have i hated huh now we must cover that by foreknowledge to know that he would know what they were doing yes because that way they can't argue the point but back up a little what made him choose a jacob right what did y'all jacob because he loved him yeah you read the bible correctly and a lot of times he's always a better guy than jacob that's right you know that's right preachy bible sometimes yourself jacob was a shyster deceiving to get these this that and the other see look what's underlined before you know what i'm done it was the thought then that and then that thought became expressed and god bought back jacob because jacob along with seed jacob alone had the seed all right so we know abraham was to see well let's just read these things about it where you want to argue the point go over turn over to 2b yeah be not afraid 1966 abraham was the elected believer the believer who walked with god he was the seed no abraham had a seat no he was the seed what good would it be doing given a man that wasn't the seed seed to bring forth you've got something wrong mentality get us straight he was the seed and his seed was going to be inherit the earth so you read all in between i just saved time to try to get you others all right questions and answer 59 12 23 whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for the seed i ain't got there yet that's way on over in the message all right but here's where we're standing what is the seed of god the promise abraham had the seed to the what is the seed now christ is christ the seed of god who seed is he if he isn't all right all right he's the seed of god then you're going down we'll get to those things later on we're starting to say a little bit at the step at the time where you can't argue the point of what i'm saying not you here but i want to make sure you understand it greater than solomon 1964 306 put around and said it like this and like that little woman at the whale we spoke of not before lyst she recognized it and did some it did something for her and those who recognized it it were the seed of god that was to be called in that day now brother i said look how that and another quote one time look how that uh worked its way out to land in that little prostitute right when all of the great religious leaders why did he choose that's right why did he choose her we've got her down at the lies if i don't get through it and you got the notes and don't come back this evening you can read down the bottom and find out how you predestinated her because she had representation of predestination she had representation from predestination right all right so now we'll get to it but why was it that that's now i'm making a statement that you know i want you to understand me see as those people back there had the seed of god and were the seed of god it's the same way we are all right now but that seed that was in them now watch they could kill giants they could do all kinds things because they had confidence in god but that seed that was in them couldn't be made alive why see the way people preach predestinations and the things like that i come into the world with eternal life but then jesus didn't have to die that solves a problem just don't even let him die just cut your head off and send him to heaven i'm not sarcastic to what i told the church of christ man he kept on asking me one day about it i said then you literally believe that just to get baptized puts people in the kingdom of god he said yes i said i'll meet you on lately near sunday we won't go to church we'll go to lake lanier and i said whether they want to or not we'll put them in the water all right and i said we'll fill the kingdom up because there's a lot of people on lake lanier yeah not more than they are to churches i said of course we're going to do it in the name of the lord jesus christ he is backed away you know he went out and do that but i was just making a point and so what am i doing now making a point those people back there you can say but yet brother dale i was born with this seed in me me well all i've asked is one simple question i asked this back with the two soul people and all years ago it's a simple question i said the new birth is it the birth of the seed you come into the world with or is it the birth of the seed you receive when you get here by hearing a preacher see they wouldn't answer me because they knew better too they were smart enough not to answer that question see if they said it was what you were born with i said well they're going to quit preaching you don't get to take no more money oh boy because you don't need no preacher you just need for people to die earthquakes will take care of filling heaven right see brother dale you're just sarcastic well is that true don't worry about my sarcasm i have to deal with that god deal with that you worry about whether it's the truth what to say right is it the truth that if it's the birth of the word you come into the world with and you don't need a new birth then why did jesus die all right just shout all the preachers of course that's some of them are wanting to do but they're wanting to sit down all the preachers and the words went out you know that they want us to maybe me preach on wednesdays and pray tapes on sundays well you know what we played a tape there the other day first one i guess never been played since i've been here because i wanted you here right around talking about communion i was glad of it but it wasn't because i had orders from headquarters careful i did have it i think because i'm sitting there listening to the tape and i thought yeah that's good to play for communion that was good i played the one you know i'm 65 all right but let brother branham explain what they had but what they needed right okay if brother branham would explain what they had then we could see what we had and then let him explain what they needed all right so let's read it spoken words written receipt 1962 318 page 59 but god said david you're a man after my heart when god creates a man he's of his kind david said thy word have i hid in my heart that i see him not against you lord only thing he needed was the rain david would have been all right if he could just had that rain right i'm reading what your prophet said right but the holy ghost wasn't yet given that's right amen that's it right amen the holy ghost was not yet given that's right so then those people back there could not have had eternal life in their soul right now i know what the prophet says so i don't mind saying it because it's all got to come together right he said the little woman there about elijah said i know thy soul lives it sees his soul with eternal but you see he didn't have the new birth because at least in the kingdom is greater than john the baptist and john the baptist was greater than all the others the bible says but see we just take a quote every person that will ever receive eternal life as far as god is concerned had eternal life before the world ever begun right is that true so then this you know we take a quote see but he said but the holy ghost was not given this is what he said he had the word and the word was in him and he could know it he said i've hid it in my heart lord it won't blossom out and act like it should but i've hid it in there lord i've hid it but when jesus came which was the word made manifest took the germ life out of it and brings it back to the word now and if david's cup runs over one about hours right what about hours if his cup runs over do we see they had the seed back there but they needed sure i believe in people born with the seed of god but not like it's taught in a message right amen not some kind of little something stuck down inside of you because god don't have to do that i know what brother ryan said you come here with a speck of eternal life i don't know what that is right but now why did he say you've got to be born again you know if i was going to be like them and i'll just open it up and say it i never have made it but i'll just make the statement i don't see why people can't preach because if i was going to preach it like that you know what i'd preach i'd preach it jesus christ come to just give us a knowledge it was always was eternal right that's exactly the way i preach it i preach that all he does just come give us a knowledge this come to tell us was eternal but i don't believe that i believe you must be born again i believe you must receive eternal life amen jesus christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world but had he not come down to that tree and died on that tree you and i would be lost right right amen so then whatever god sees is wonderful but there's got to be a display on earth amen all right see so you're following what i'm saying so down through the church ages we see the true seed let me read a couple of these and i'll have to take up here at the scene and i know i can't finish but down through the church ages we see the true seed of abraham which is christ down through the church ages we see the true seed of abraham which is christ see we're not abraham's natural state it's not a jew that's a jew out there live with us you this is a jew inwardly all right so down through the church ages then just as the old testament we can see the seed of abraham which is christ and how that they fought for the word and brought forth the word for the age they were in but at the same time typing it now as the natural seed of abraham we see the natural seed of abraham literally in the denominations claiming to be christians claiming to be saved saying they have accepted jesus christ as their savior great wonderful things taking place around the world great moves great things going right but yet they're not saved amen but brother said there's a lot of difference i'm looking at yesterday we'll get to it one day he said a lot of difference in saying you're a christian and you're a born-again christian he said you can be a christian and that's a confession but he said when you're born again you are that's what it is it's not you anyway it's him right all right let me get another quote or two hallelujah see there was a predestinated seat for each age he calls it on two set 284 of the um churches book he talks about it like this no names will we blot it out of the book of eternal life now your name can be blotted out in the book of life but not like the book of eternal life but that is another record though contained in the book of life now that maybe needs to be preached upon a lot but this is the record god hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life eternal and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal right those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that great royal seed jesus christ watch him was planted so whatever went down it's got to be the same seed come back up right he was planted all right he died that the life that was in him came up through the wheat plant see all the seven church ages now and is reproducing itself in multitudes of weak seeds having the same life in them and being like the original because they by because by spirit they are original right all right look on down proving his word 64. he by four knowledge predestinated the seed for every age that would believe it if you'll notice in there for each age goes right on with his word everything right on time nothing hinders god sees it clicking right on time same message proving his word that was prayer paragraph 72 this is paragraph 122 so in order to have believers to meet the word and watch him he knew the word was going to be predestinated right so in order to have believers to meet the word he's got to predestinate it to that age all right and see he's got to predestinate this thing to be to meet the challenge of the age did you get it yes did you feel it did you see it do you understand it that's the three things the four things he said that's what happened today he predestinated to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in malachi 4 it's got to happen when he come over and predestinates anything to happen in his word he had to prove his word to be so when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated abroad she's going to be there going to be a rapture she's going to be there he's predestinated it by his foreknowledge there's nothing going to stop it he said well he's just right back to point amen cause foreknowledge knows where the seed's going to land right no problem rising in the sun 65 4 18 morning service don't fear anymore for every for ordained predestinated seed of god will come to life when that life light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crop that god ordains it to do he he has raised the dead see what was david waiting on the holy ghost to come what are we waiting on today the holy ghost to quicken the word amen right to make it alive all right every bit of that seed comes to life might as well quit do you understand what i'm saying amen i truly believe in a seed of god that comes predestinated eternally from god amen are the word of god that comes predestinated eternally i believe that right but i believe that when you come into the world you come into the world dying and on your way to hell but god for knew you would want salvation so we had it ready for you that proves your predestination amen that proves that you were a part of god before the world the little woman at the well as i said the last two quotes there brought around said she had representation of predestination then he said she had another quote he said she had representation from predestination what was any different about her than anybody else now here's where we gotta hold it close brother brown said that when that seed crossed that little woman said when that gospel crossed her he said that word came alive but did that give her the new birth that's all i'm asking if it did jesus didn't have to die because he'd do it for one he could do it for everybody the seed was quickened and made alive for the age she was living amen david the seed was quickened in his heart he knew who he was and then he could say there's nothing going to kill me till i become king because i've been anointed right right ain't nothing going to stop me so dead go glide bring a dozen of them he had five stones because they claimed that goliath had about four or five more brothers he figured he'd have to take them all he was ready but you see what was quickened to him was for that time kill the bear kill the lion kill the giant but the holy ghost wasn't there to give him eternal life the holy ghost was not given to that little woman there at the well because jesus had not died that's what your scripture says that's right he's not yet been glorified the scripture said so they couldn't get eternal life but there was no way to get eternal life until jesus went to calvary and released the life the other was representation of predestination sure god for you he foreign you abraham and all of that yes but did he give them eternal life not while they were here on earth well you just don't believe predestination and go far enough huh i gotta hold it to the word because i gotta bring forth knowledge into it if you don't hold it for knowledge then what are you gonna do because brother brown said predestination looks back to four knowledge so four knowledge come before predestination that's what he had to say about it why can't we believe that right but brother ryan said that's why people can't believe on predestination under reprobation that's right that's in the church book our predestination under glorification right see then why would you say brute beast made to be destroyed there's people in the world today now they're human beings now listen don't get me wrong every human being was born as i said in the message he was born with a soul and that soul was an obligation to serve god and that leading of that soul to draw him to god he perverted it but yet there's brute beasts that are nothing nothing but cannon fodder h2o walking on him in human feet but you're gonna walk down and say you're this one and you're that one and you're this one and you're that one everybody's on the right side is good everybody on the left side done missed it oh that was predestinated for everybody to get over on the left side today that was going to be there that's good presbyterian good baptist you know god for knew he would be on the left side and he'd be on the right side right but you see the word has been preached today was the one that was predestinated that's what i believe right of course you may not believe that anyway that's all right but see that's what i believe going brothers the journal of life i didn't get down to that part where we could cover it but the germ of life is the word of god because the word is the only thing that has life we'll take this spur claw this and put it up into prayer claws now because highest amount of our body and then we'll pray over here and then we'll cut it up to make the prayer close all right thank you because i believe in your prayers i believe in you being led of god to lay your hands on children and all lay your hands on pray and believe god god might hear one of these kids and pass over all the rest of us that's the way i believe it amen sorry that tires you up then i'm sorry but it's true that's right so who worries about it sister johnny called me today says brother dale quit apologizing for telling us the truth right i said well i don't i'm human you know i'm human i don't see nobody lost all right you know i'd like to see the devil saved but i hate him so much i wouldn't well there's something wrong with you i didn't think we're supposed to hate anybody show me where you can hate him he's the best thing you've got apart from salvation israel wouldn't be in the homeland we were talking about if the devil hadn't been loosed on them to drive them back to that you know what brother brown said it would be released 20 years later or was released 20 years later on the bride of christ the driver to the message of the hour the devil's the best thing you got outside of salvation because he's driving you to god he'll drive you to your knees the best thing he could do big on vacation but he just can't stand 523 in the spiral book anybody has a need we're just saying a verse or something you have a need come and let's pray because i believe the world council of turkey work by yourself you know i thought about something the other day might not mean anything to you but and i'm not against people but you know the basis of all of your service stations are owned by a certain group of people right you agree even though they're coming under and they're coming over here and they're buying up all the service days you say well they can't they can't do nothing because we're free people what if they said we ain't going to sell you no gas unless you agree that the islamic doctrine is just as equal right is your christian doctrine where are you going to get gas you see how close it is you say no it can't be done here you got enough to get home come on folks i'm not throwing off on nobody what if they said you've got to agree that a lit islamic doctrine not that it's right but it's just as equal or good and that's what your president has said right that we don't throw off on nobody because everybody's religious well that's how close it could be but see we don't want to think that way but everyone said if you know what you've got in your pocket the money you got he said you'd take it out in the street and burn it now i ain't seen nobody going out and building a fire and i haven't either right but that's what he's saying we believe everything he said do we what about it he said keep your homes and take the mark of the beast ninety percent of the people in america's homes they owe on don't mean a thing cause you don't know them only because they can get them too but see we don't look at it like that do we let's pray father which prayer clothes went around among the people everybody laying hands on and praying we want to cut up make what we call the prayer clause for the people to be sent out we just ask you now lord that you would just reach down and touch this prayer cloth and it's for the hands of the people maybe it was a little child there that you would hear and that you'd react upon that and it can never lord be washed off people worry about washing a prayer cloth it can't be washed off the anointing can't be washed off it's cause it's not a natural the oil that would put on there might leave but the anointing cannot leave so we ask you now that you would just sanctify this little partial we have here and as we send it out then that you would transmit to the people your very desires and thoughts we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen amen if we never meet again on this earth is i is foreign now forever there
