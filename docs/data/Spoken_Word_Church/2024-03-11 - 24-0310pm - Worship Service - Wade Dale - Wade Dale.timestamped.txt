[6:05] gone and um I remember he asked me he
[6:08] said are you sure you're
[6:10] ready and
[6:13] um I said yeah cuz somehow cuz I'm the
[6:17] type of person I guess because of
[6:19] military I can't do hypocrisy it's
[6:21] either one way or another you know what
[6:23] I'm saying so I either have to choose to
[6:27] be a believer or be a
[6:30] Christian I cannot do that I can't I I
[6:33] just
[6:34] can't um
[6:37] so for a very long
[6:40] time I blamed myself for my car I don't
[6:45] know if you remember my BM I got a car I
[6:48] was in a car with my BMW so I was so
[6:52] angry with God cuz I'm like that's my
[6:54] BMW you took away from
[6:57] me I worked so hard for that you know I
[7:02] was the probably the first one to drive
[7:04] a BMW in my
[7:07] family and it was not
[7:10] cheap and I was so angry and I'm like
[7:13] God you took my BMW that's my BMW you
[7:17] took and I would be so angry and God
[7:20] knows like brother a w said sometimes
[7:24] God has to get you off of your high
[7:27] horse right and let me tell you he got
[7:30] me off of my high horse real quick cuz I
[7:33] was doing too
[7:35] much
[7:38] so Something Told me um I paid all my
[7:43] fines and stuff like that so something
[7:45] told me
[7:46] to uh look up apparently there was a
[7:50] post sign involved that my BMW heit
[7:53] also and um as you all know everything
[7:57] was paid for because it was to
[8:01] and um something told me to look up the
[8:04] owner of that post sign because when I
[8:08] went to court apparently he's wanted
[8:11] them you know he wanted to be paid for
[8:13] the Post sign or something I don't know
[8:16] and
[8:17] um something told me to just write him
[8:20] and just look for him and write him and
[8:23] just apologize for his post
[8:26] sign you know because I felt so bad cuz
[8:30] that's you know that's his
[8:33] business and I wrote him and uh my
[8:36] caregiver just told
[8:40] me um so anyway I was going through his
[8:42] Facebook post and I could see how he was
[8:45] making fun of my BMW how he got
[8:48] wrecked and um calling it just making
[8:51] fun of it and I got so mad CU I'm like y
[8:55] you don't understand the story behind
[8:57] this BMW so he was like oh they're not a
[9:01] powerful machine like you think it is
[9:03] they are a powerful machine cuz guess
[9:05] what somehow through that
[9:07] BMW all the airbags deployed that's how
[9:11] I
[9:14] survived and here I am telling him sorry
[9:18] well guess what my
[9:21] caregiver who just happens to replace my
[9:24] other caregiver who usually comes with
[9:26] me and she's Catholic by the way so
[9:28] thanks
[9:32] wait um
[9:36] so the
[9:38] coin and um she struggles with um she
[9:43] has she's dead in one
[9:46] ear
[9:48] so when I tell you it's been coincidence
[9:51] after coincidence anyway I was telling
[9:54] her my story and she told me you can sue
[9:57] that man for slander and get Millions
[10:00] cuz her sister is a
[10:03] lawyer so here I am we're going to get
[10:06] saway and I'm like well another thing
[10:10] this church we don't believe in suing
[10:13] taking somebody to
[10:15] court so she's like if I were you I
[10:18] would do it so y'all pleas pray for me
[10:22] because I'm not going to I have a lot of
[10:25] debt
[10:26] okay I have a lot of debt and I want
[10:30] another
[10:33] BMW oh
[10:36] man
[10:38] so and my little sister would tell me
[10:41] you need to find a lawyer and sue
[10:44] somebody and I just couldn't do
[10:48] it well y'all give me the grace
[10:53] because if that's the case I don't know
[10:56] how much I can get for slander but she's
[10:59] like just find a lawyer and Sue that
[11:03] man
[11:05] cuz I have screenshots of how he was
[11:08] making fun of my
[11:11] BMW I mean I even have a screenshot of
[11:15] how I wrote him a message on Facebook
[11:20] apologizing and apparently my case had
[11:23] not been settled in court so regardless
[11:26] of how it
[11:27] happened that's apparent that slander in
[11:33] Georgia and plus I'm a veteran so y'all
[11:37] can't tell me God doesn't exist because
[11:39] he really really does believe me he does
[11:44] when I tell you he can change me and
[11:46] I've done it all everything I mean I
[11:49] even join the military and War pants who

[11:53] that I caught myself I caught myself
[11:57] throwing away uh
[11:59] um my makeup in my car she can tell you
[12:02] I was literally throwing them away if
[12:05] that's not God I don't know who it is

[20:15] thinking I heard that song recently and
[20:18] it's such a powerful song I Believe each
[20:21] of us as Christians get to a point in
[20:23] our lives where somewhere along the path
[20:26] you're walking with the Lord you
[20:28] you kind of stop asking him for things
[20:30] and you start thanking him you thank him
[20:33] for the things that has been you thank
[20:35] him for the things that are happening
[20:37] and then the things you need that you
[20:39] don't have you start thinking for them
[20:41] and you start start to see that manifest
[20:43] there's such a power and such a reality
[20:46] and just thank him for it you need
[20:48] healing start thanking him for it
[20:50] whatever you need whatever you've had
[20:52] need of and um it's such a lesson if you
[20:55] start to look at that that area of
[20:58] gratitude you start thinking the Lord um
[21:01] is such a powerful thing and then you
[21:03] start to notice not the things you don't
[21:05] have but what God has already blessed
[21:07] you with and how you can be a blessing

[27:18] some mean casserole but let's go to
[27:20] Psalms
[27:21] 1001 and um you know when we look at
[27:25] worship we
[27:28] um know that in the
[27:30] Bible that the children of
[27:32] Israel when they would go to
[27:35] battle kind of outstanding when when
[27:38] when the the children of Israel got
[27:39] ready to go to battle what's the first
[27:42] thing they did they didn't start
[27:44] sharpening their swords they got all
[27:46] that prepared back in the camp but when
[27:48] they got ready to move the song service
[27:50] started song service started they had
[27:53] the singers and they had the Sultry and
[27:55] they had the the string instruments and
[27:57] all that cuz David during the whole time
[28:00] of writing the
[28:01] Psalms they were going to war they were
[28:04] battling everywhere you know so he was
[28:07] quite familiar with
[28:09] singing and you know he could um he
[28:12] could play there and play a harp and
[28:14] remember the evil spirits went away from
[28:16] Saul and quit tormenting him just by
[28:19] David playing um a beautiful note on a u
[28:23] on a harp so we know that music is part
[28:25] of worship service it's not the main
[28:29] part we don't worship for 2 hours and
[28:31] then preach for 30 minutes no we it has
[28:35] its time it has its place and I believe
[28:37] we do it correct I just want to as the
[28:41] old saying is sharpen our pencil a
[28:43] little bit and um fill in some gaps and
[28:47] and learn some new songs and learn some
[28:49] chords and and see what the Lord has for
[28:52] us so thank you all for coming and be
[28:54] patient with us this first time we've
[28:55] ever done it so just be patient patient

[32:18] to your people father just bless us now
[32:20] in further in this service in Jesus name
[32:23] amen let's give them a big hand
[32:26] to we appreciate there there's some
[32:29] there's some brothers that I'm
[32:30] acquainted with that that that that ask
[32:32] me all the time said could you just send
[32:34] me
[32:36] one you've got so many could you just
[32:38] send me one brother Claude I was talking
[32:39] to him yesterday he said could you just
[32:41] send me one I said nah got to keep them
[32:44] all they decide to come here so you know
[32:48] yeah we we'll keep them here and and if
[32:50] you need them you can call them but you
[32:51] can't have them so you can pick their
[32:54] brain but you can't take them with you
[32:55] you know they stay here so uh he was
[32:58] very envious about u u he was an old
[33:01] computer guy back when they were doing
[33:03] the punch card that's how old he is you
[33:05] know when the computers
[33:06] went you know and all that had rooms
[33:09] full of these things going around and
[33:11] around that's how he first got started
[33:12] in it so he's very um appreciative of of
[33:17] of what we do and and what is what's
[33:20] produced what's produced online I you
[33:22] know I don't know if y'all look at it
[33:23] but but look at the website sometime
[33:26] look at some of the archive sermons and
[33:29] the quality and the things that uh that
[33:31] these brothers have put together and
[33:33] crawled up in this
[33:35] ceiling um and to there's not much in
[33:38] this ceiling we didn't ask brother Aaron
[33:41] to do that amen that's right we asked
[33:45] somebody skinny to to get up here and do
[33:47] Brother Anderson he's long enough to
[33:48] reach up through here but we had to run
[33:49] all these if you you can't see the wires
[33:51] they've hit them all and um but you can
[33:54] see them from right here but they put it
[33:56] together just so that you can have a
[33:57] church service and the people that can't
[34:00] come that are sick that they can have
[34:02] something to watch and be able to
[34:04] worship online and we sure appreciate
[34:05] that so let's go to Psalms 100 and let's
[34:08] talk about just for a few minutes and
[34:09] then we'll turn it over to brother Joe
[34:11] when we get
[34:12] finished with um with the exhortation
[34:15] here then you can make maybe take about
[34:17] a f minute break and go to the restroom
[34:18] or or you know loosen your fingers up
[34:21] and get ready to play so brother Joe's
[34:24] got the U everything set up so we'll
[34:27] just let him go and and I don't know if
[34:29] y'all know it or not but brother joose
[34:31] our first regular song leader was his
[34:36] father here at this church in 1970 some
[34:40] odd one two three somewhere in there he
[34:44] was our song leader uh dad lead singing
[34:47] for a while brother Mo because they
[34:48] didn't have anybody and then brother
[34:50] George Canada comes along and and he
[34:52] leads singing for several years and uh
[34:54] he was actually here before Joe was even
[34:56] born and uh I told him we've known your
[34:58] dad I've known your dad longer than you
[34:59] have and uh we have because we all kind
[35:02] of grew up together brother John and and
[35:04] so it's just wonderful to see the
[35:07] cycle that we see the young that we see
[35:09] the young Joseph come and pick up where
[35:12] brother George is that and uh and we
[35:14] appreciate brother Joe he's got many
[35:16] many hats that he wears and and he wears
[35:18] them well so we appreciate that so
[35:20] Psalms 100
[35:23] verse verse
[35:25] one here's a that knows how to worship
[35:27] David said a Psalm of Praise Make a
[35:29] Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands
[35:33] serve the Lord with gladness come before
[35:35] his presence with
[35:37] singing know ye the Lord he is God it is
[35:41] he that hath made us and not we ourself
[35:43] we are his people and the Sheep of his
[35:46] Pastor enter into his gates with
[35:49] Thanksgiving and into his courts with
[35:51] praise be thankful unto him and bless
[35:54] his name you know that word Thanksgiving
[35:56] is is is is something that you you come
[35:58] and you honor um when we have
[36:01] Thanksgiving Day we honor the pilgrims
[36:03] that came and and um and gave us uh the
[36:06] new land here and we give we give
[36:09] Thanksgiving to the Lord for giving us a
[36:10] new land he gave us the Holy Ghost he
[36:13] gave us a new land to walk in and he's
[36:15] going to give us what this land amen cuz
[36:18] we're inheritors of this Earth we're not
[36:20] going to heaven Heaven's coming here
[36:23] amen that's what we see the new city was
[36:25] coming down out of heaven here on the
[36:27] earth God's not going to destroy this
[36:29] Earth he made it for us to inhabit so
[36:31] he's not going to destroy it we're going
[36:32] to live on it and have dominion over it
[36:35] that's what we should have been for the
[36:37] Lord is good and his Mercy is
[36:38] Everlasting his truth endureth through
[36:40] all generations all right you may be
[36:42] seated I'll read the rest of these but
[36:44] Psalm
[36:45] 68:3 says I will praise the name of God
[36:49] with a
[36:51] song and I will Magnify Him with
[36:53] Thanksgiving our confession our praise
[36:58] I'll get through some of these and I'll
[36:59] make some comments Psalms
[37:01] 33:1 says rejoice in the Lord oh ye
[37:04] righteous for praise is comely for the
[37:07] upright you know you look at at
[37:10] different um Arenas and venues and you
[37:13] see um you have your contemporary artist
[37:17] now and you've got your old southern
[37:19] baptist you know that that sings the
[37:20] sing like what we always say out of the
[37:22] red book and then you've got your
[37:24] contemporary singers that sing a little
[37:26] bit a little bit different with a little
[37:27] bit more upbeat or or a little bit
[37:30] different uh sound to it but if it's
[37:33] done by somebody with the Holy Ghost see
[37:36] that makes the difference that's why you
[37:38] want to have a congregation that's full
[37:41] of the Holy Ghost that every person that
[37:43] walks up here brings that little lick of
[37:45] fire with them all right and then takes
[37:47] that little lick of fire and then what
[37:49] extends it to you the people they're not
[37:53] up here singing for their
[37:54] s uh they're not up here for their self
[37:57] they're here to do what give that gift
[37:59] to you all right they don't want we
[38:01] don't want you to give it to the world
[38:03] young adults
[38:04] kids don't give it to the world the
[38:07] world's going to just destroy you give
[38:10] it to God give it to the greatest people
[38:12] ever walked on the face of the Earth and
[38:13] they're not out there they're in here
[38:15] right so rejoice in the Lord oh ye
[38:18] righteous for praise is comely for the
[38:21] upright listen in other words we enjoy
[38:23] we should enjoy good worship right we we
[38:26] should enjoy when the spirit of the Lord
[38:29] comes in and the presence just comes
[38:31] over and it's like a breath of fresh air
[38:33] and we can feel the presence of the Lord
[38:36] and we can see I want to be able to see
[38:38] the effects of
[38:40] that all right I want to see the effects
[38:42] of that the effects of that is worship
[38:45] with holy hands and and and say Amen
[38:47] every once in a while and and say thank
[38:49] you Lord for air conditioning
[38:53] and I'm sorry wait a minute thank you
[38:55] Lord for brother Aaron that knows to
[38:56] come up here and do something with the
[38:58] air
[39:02] conditioner and he plays the guitar and
[39:05] he the minister and he's song leader so
[39:09] he wears many hats too so we appreciate
[39:12] him or was that oh praise the Lord with
[39:14] harp sing unto him with Sultry and an
[39:17] instrument of 10 string sing unto him a
[39:19] new song play
[39:23] skillfully with a loud noise I I like it
[39:26] when Richard plays skillfully with a
[39:28] loud noise I like to hear that Bas every
[39:32] and everybody's smiling and saying amen
[39:34] so he that we like we like Brother
[39:36] Richard playing that Bas today we're
[39:38] going to brag on the musicians all right
[39:40] we'll brag on the preachers and other
[39:42] time whenever we get good enough to get
[39:44] bragged on we'll just brag on y'all amen
[39:48] what Rich so Richard Richard does good
[39:51] on the base we all of you do a good job
[39:54] every one of you and the ones that are
[39:55] that are practi iing for other uh
[39:58] playing other um U instruments we got
[40:02] our sisters up here in front of the
[40:03] piano I sure wish we had it spread out a
[40:05] little more where you didn't have to be
[40:07] in front of that piano but maybe we can
[40:09] try to do that later on Psalms 107 verse
[40:12] 20 now look the Bible says he sent his
[40:15] word and healed him now we quote this a
[40:17] lot but it is also included with
[40:21] worship he sent his word and healed them
[40:23] and delivered them from their
[40:25] destruction oh that men would praise the
[40:28] Lord for his goodness and for his
[40:30] wonderful Works to the children of men
[40:33] and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of
[40:35] Thanksgiving and declare his works with
[40:39] rejoicing because that's what you do
[40:40] when you come in here is it just
[40:43] repetition or is it just repetition for
[40:46] you I'm asking you that question do we
[40:48] sing Amazing Grace because that's a song
[40:50] that everybody knows that's a song
[40:52] Everybody's comfortable with and
[40:53] everybody knows words without putting
[40:54] them on the screen no I I sing Amazing
[40:58] Grace because I'm a recipient of
[41:01] that I can relate to every verse in that
[41:04] song every verse I can relate to that
[41:08] and that's what you need to do make it
[41:10] personal when you come in here and and
[41:13] and and somebody sings a special it
[41:15] ought to be special that's why it's
[41:17] called a special CU it's
[41:21] special you're you're instead of
[41:23] including everybody in the in the
[41:25] worship you you got one person with one
[41:27] piece of talent that God's given them
[41:29] and you got that one person and that
[41:31] person's either practiced or or or got
[41:35] with one of the brothers and sisters and
[41:37] they've took that little extra effort to
[41:40] make it sound good
[41:43] right so what had they done they have
[41:45] took they took their worship to a
[41:48] different
[41:49] level listen this ain't like singing in
[41:51] the
[41:53] shower this ain't like singing in the
[41:55] shower
[41:57] y'all don't do that okay yeah pray for
[42:01] me and sister June she has to hear
[42:07] it but when you get
[42:10] down when you get down the the reason I
[42:12] sing in the shower cuz it feels good I
[42:14] mean that's the time I'm getting clean
[42:15] and that ought to be the time when you
[42:17] come here when you're getting cleaned up
[42:19] when the scales are coming off of you
[42:21] cuz you've been out in the world for you
[42:23] know days at a time and you got all that
[42:25] scaly feeling on to me it's like it's
[42:28] oily it's oily it's like you walk
[42:30] through you know you go through
[42:31] somewhere and you you just feel dirty
[42:34] but when you come here you ought to feel
[42:35] clean or if you're not clean you ought
[42:36] to come here and get clean one of the
[42:38] two all right because you're going to
[42:40] leave one way or the other you're going
[42:43] to leave the same you going to keep that
[42:45] oily and go out or you going to get rid
[42:46] of that oily and go out you again cuz
[42:49] listen we all need a renewing the Bible
[42:51] talks about a renewing of our mind well
[42:53] the renewing of your mind is is is the
[42:55] Bible says put a song in your heart all
[42:59] right well that's where you're singing
[43:00] from you're singing from your heart not
[43:02] trying to like brother brandham said
[43:04] he's he said they'll sing these great
[43:06] you know notes up here and these great
[43:08] notes down here and he said and commit
[43:10] adultery the day after right he was
[43:13] talking about Pat Boon and some of them
[43:15] that was playing at The Honky Tonks at
[43:16] night and then playing at the church
[43:18] service I didn't know if y'all knew that
[43:19] or not but different ones was doing that
[43:22] they come from The Honky Tonks and then
[43:24] walks in and sits down and starts
[43:25] playing
[43:26] I know one time we were at a church one
[43:28] time and this brother he's it's a
[43:31] message church and he like music but he
[43:33] brought this guy in that was like a
[43:35] country music he wasn't a famous guy but
[43:37] he came in to to play and he played so
[43:40] loud and it was just so it wasn't his
[43:43] atmosphere to be in he needed to be
[43:47] sorry he needed to be in the bar you
[43:49] know playing his instrument but they
[43:51] brought him in to play for some silly
[43:53] reason and I'm just not going to do that
[43:56] yeah well Have We Become hirelings where
[43:58] we have to be hired to come in and play
[44:00] the music or are we get somebody off the
[44:03] street because we can't play
[44:05] good you think about that you start
[44:08] practicing and you practice for the Lord
[44:11] and forget about what the world says but
[44:13] we don't need somebody outside playing
[44:15] our music for us come on somebody we
[44:17] need somebody filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:19] to sing the songs for us you when you
[44:21] open your book if you got the Holy Ghost
[44:24] That Fire ought to go right down into
[44:25] those words words and they ought to come
[44:27] and burn off that page and and we all
[44:29] have our favorite songs right everybody
[44:31] everybody has a favorite song that you
[44:33] sing in your and when and then you have
[44:36] a situational
[44:38] song right right you have a situational
[44:41] song when you get in some kind of
[44:43] situation you start singing that song
[44:45] right and it ain't something to do with
[44:48] the world it's it's a Christian song I
[44:52] hope I know sometimes you know and
[44:54] that's how uh just stopped for a minute
[44:56] I was going to say this later on but I
[44:58] say it now you see how music influences
[45:00] the world
[45:03] though I mean brother Donnie I mean he's
[45:05] 70 and and I'm 64 so he's 70 plus but a
[45:11] little but the era of music what I'm
[45:13] saying is the era of music was beetles
[45:15] and first one thing and another like
[45:17] that and you go into uh you know you
[45:19] don't want to have nothing to do with
[45:21] that right we don't want we don't have
[45:22] no Beetle music in the in the house I
[45:25] hope not I hope you ain't got no beetles
[45:27] in your house but but if if you do
[45:30] there's an exterminator it's called
[45:32] Jesus
[45:35] and he'll come anytime too you ain't got
[45:37] to wait on
[45:38] him but where was I going with this no
[45:41] you go into Walmart and you hear that
[45:43] one song a
[45:45] song and it might be just like real soft
[45:48] it may not be like blaring it may be
[45:51] like and you start singing it in your
[45:54] head and you can't get it out of your
[45:56] head especially one that you've heard
[45:58] back in the world and that well what is
[46:00] that that Satan
[46:03] anointing I'm sorry but that's Satan
[46:05] anointing the praise is supposed to go
[46:06] to
[46:07] god let's just be honest it's it's the
[46:10] anointing that's supposed to go to God
[46:12] Satan has brought in something that we
[46:14] listen to out in the world and we can't
[46:16] get out of our head when they can't do
[46:18] that but when I start hearing that and I
[46:20] start tapping my foot at something like
[46:22] that that you know played and uh
[46:26] um I start singing Amazing Grace I Know
[46:30] It real well so and you know what that
[46:33] does it kind of it moves that thing out
[46:34] of the
[46:35] way but now what's the difference in Us
[46:37] in the world though because the world
[46:39] will take that and they will use that
[46:41] music and then listen every piece of a
[46:44] of music has an anointing with it every
[46:48] piece of music it doesn't matter worldly
[46:52] music Christian music it all has an
[46:54] anointing to it because listen
[46:56] some of these people can't write these
[46:58] songs without an anointing even though
[47:00] you're out in the world and you hear
[47:02] these songs you know that that come from
[47:04] somewhere that had an anointing to it
[47:06] they're just not sitting there going I
[47:08] think this will rhyme with this you know
[47:11] cuz Psalms are supposed to rhyme I think
[47:13] that's will rhyme with this and no
[47:15] they're anointed like Claud brother
[47:17] Claude was preaching here about the The
[47:18] Fifth Dimension you know singing The Age
[47:21] of Aquarius well that's that's us now
[47:23] see most of you that's heard it it's
[47:24] going to be it's going to be in your
[47:25] head for the rest of the
[47:27] sermon mine too but um but it was an
[47:31] anointed for the
[47:32] time all right and then brother brandham
[47:35] said you know like Elvis Presley he sold
[47:37] his soul for a fleet of Cadillacs he
[47:39] sold his talent to the world where God
[47:41] wanted him to use the talent for the
[47:43] Lord because he come from a a
[47:45] Pentecostal background Pentecostal
[47:47] church but he turned around and gave it
[47:49] to Satan instead of giving it to the
[47:53] Lord but you know you you it's kind of
[47:58] funny have you heard Elvis saying how
[48:01] great thou art oh
[48:04] wow oh wow I mean that was an
[48:08] anointing but that man if he didn't get
[48:10] born again before he died he's going to
[48:13] find out how great that man
[48:16] is sadly to
[48:20] say but there's an anointing there for
[48:23] every one of them every one of them so
[48:25] so same with me and you when we come to
[48:28] church
[48:29] service we want to be anointed by the
[48:32] Holy
[48:33] Ghost with what we have that listen I
[48:36] say what we have that we have what that
[48:38] you have may different from what I have
[48:40] not the different Holy Ghost but a
[48:42] different anointing like and I know
[48:44] y'all I know I know some of you like
[48:46] this certain strip of songs or pages of
[48:50] songs Just a marry shaking her head she
[48:53] there's we got our favorites
[48:56] but we got to break out over here
[48:57] because because you know brother over
[48:59] here may like this group of favorites
[49:03] all right but we mold them together and
[49:06] and it's kind of uh trying to formulate
[49:08] this I'm trying to think like David
[49:10] here's
[49:12] David he doesn't have a recorder he
[49:15] doesn't have even sound you know like an
[49:17] amplifier he's playing these Psalms and
[49:20] he's he's singing these songs and he's
[49:22] playing this instrument and really he's
[49:25] playing to
[49:27] himself he doesn't have an audience
[49:29] except when he did that with with Saul
[49:31] but there really wasn't an audience
[49:32] there in other words David wasn't a
[49:34] concert pianist you understand what I
[49:37] mean he was pretty much well who was he
[49:39] playing for he's playing for us that's
[49:42] right he was playing for someone with
[49:44] the Holy Ghost that had an anointing
[49:46] that could cuz listen if you can't
[49:48] identify with the Bible then you're not
[49:50] a Christian you got to identify yourself
[49:53] you've heard it a thousand times you got
[49:55] to find yourself in the Bible sir you
[49:57] got to find who you are and you've got
[50:00] to find
[50:02] out David look all that men would praise
[50:07] the Lord for his goodness well who's he
[50:08] talking about he's not talking about
[50:09] himself he's talking about
[50:11] us oh that men would praise the Lord for
[50:15] his goodness and for his wonderful Works
[50:16] to the children of men why do you like
[50:19] songs that are different sometimes or or
[50:21] a song that's special to you something
[50:24] in that lyrics or something in in That
[50:25] Song speaks to what you've went through
[50:28] During the period of your life or what
[50:30] you're going through right now there's
[50:32] something going on that God will allow
[50:35] that and to me that's God helping us
[50:38] don't have to have a minister there
[50:40] every five minutes but you can have a
[50:42] song in your heart every five minutes
[50:44] and God can give you a
[50:47] song that will help you through your
[50:51] situation but when you come in this
[50:53] door we know that the words more
[50:56] important but when you come through this
[50:58] door though we have got to be
[51:01] washed as I said before we've got to be
[51:03] we've got to be washed
[51:06] off that's why I said you know if you
[51:08] have a fight with your wife or your
[51:09] husband or your kids get it done before
[51:11] you get come in that door if not you
[51:13] going to bring that thing in here hello
[51:16] somebody that's why I said it and I'm
[51:17] going to say it one more time you need
[51:20] to be here 20 to 30 minutes before the
[51:22] service
[51:24] starts now I'm not trying to make it a
[51:26] law but you could hinder the service by
[51:29] walking in here with an attitude two
[51:31] minutes before the service starts hello
[51:33] somebody amen you know why cuz I
[51:36] [Applause]
[51:39] have I have done
[51:44] it I know that's why I feel safe saying
[51:47] that cuz we've all done it but we should
[51:51] not see that's one thing you can
[51:53] control nobody else can control that
[51:56] can't control your attitude coming
[51:57] through that door you're the only one
[51:59] that can control it if you have to stop
[52:03] and pray before you go in that door stop
[52:05] and pray before you go in that door or
[52:07] come in and see into this cuz I want us
[52:10] to see too and I'll I'll read this what
[52:12] brother rown says um about this being a
[52:16] in other words this is a place of safety
[52:18] this is a place that that you can come
[52:20] to and you ought to be able to feel safe
[52:23] you ought to be able to be able to to
[52:24] speak to the Lord in worship and in the
[52:27] preaching coming forth but also in the
[52:29] worship you should feel
[52:31] comfortable in this
[52:34] building if you're
[52:36] not maybe you're not a
[52:39] Christian maybe you're not a sheep yet I
[52:42] said yet I didn't say you I'm not
[52:43] throwing people out but but
[52:46] uh we have we do believe in
[52:49] conversion from a goat to a sheep we
[52:52] believe that we're all bunch of goats
[52:54] but we do
[52:56] by the transforming power of the Lord
[52:58] become comfortable with sheep because we
[53:00] become a
[53:01] Sheep
[53:03] amen and let them sacrifice the
[53:06] sacrifice of Thanksgiving I was thinking
[53:08] this morning I mainly thinking of
[53:10] brother Michael and the job they do with
[53:14] with driving an hour and a half and I
[53:15] know some of you drive close to that
[53:16] anyway but they drive from
[53:20] Atlanta an hour and a half one way to
[53:23] get here and he gets here on
[53:27] time uh before
[53:30] time so that's a sacrifice and God won't
[53:33] let that
[53:34] go he'll give you
[53:37] something something he'll give you you
[53:39] say well I you know I'm I don't know
[53:41] where it's that well he
[53:43] will you make a move to God he's going
[53:47] to have to make a move to you the
[53:49] problem is that sometimes we don't make
[53:50] that
[53:51] move but if you'll make that move to God
[53:54] and step out and say God I'm going to
[53:56] sacrifice my
[53:58] time just like coming up here for Bible
[54:01] study and coming to the different thing
[54:03] functions that we have it's a
[54:07] sacrifice but it should be a sacrifice
[54:09] of Thanksgiving that we can
[54:12] come not that it's a drudgery or if I
[54:15] don't show up you know I'm brother Way's
[54:17] got this secret calendar in

[55:45] way let the people sing louder than the
[55:48] song leader right it's not a show you're
[55:52] not trying to show how many cords I mean
[55:54] or how much how many octaves you can
[55:56] carry it's getting the people involved
[55:59] in the worship service and involved in
[56:02] what we're doing because
[56:04] listen you've made a sacrifice if you
[56:07] made a sacrifice to get here let's

[56:42] congregation Psalms 111 verse1 says
[56:45] praise ye the Lord I will praise the
[56:47] Lord look with my whole heart put
[56:51] everything you got into
[56:52] it in the Assembly of the upright and in
[56:56] the
[56:57] congregation Psalms 150:1 praise ye the
[57:00] Lord praise God in his Sanctuary Praise
[57:04] Him in the firmament of his power praise
[57:07] him for his mighty acts thank you for
[57:09] what he did for you thank him for what
[57:12] he did for you during the week amen
[57:17] right have you ever thanked him for the
[57:19] job you got oh bless God not my
[57:23] job
[57:25] well I guess God didn't give you that
[57:26] one and you probably going to find have
[57:28] to get another one pretty quick because
[57:30] um you need to give God praise for
[57:32] everything you
[57:33] got everything you got give him praise
[57:36] that's right cuz you know what God may
[57:38] have you in that place and you think
[57:40] this is Hell on Earth and it may be but
[57:44] he put you in there to shine a
[57:46] light he put you there to shine a light
[57:49] and listen he put every one of you that
[57:52] are born again in your place when you go
[57:55] out in that world you are showing an A
[57:58] Witness of at the day of judgment God's
[58:01] going to say I sent the sister right by
[58:07] you and you turn me down remember what
[58:11] the Bible says right the Bible says no
[58:14] they're not turning you
[58:16] down God said they're turning me
[58:19] down and as we were talking about the
[58:21] cup of water in my name and all the
[58:22] different things that comes from us that
[58:24] that emanates from us eternal life
[58:27] listen eternal life has to come through
[58:29] the body cuz that's the only place there
[58:31] is eternal life it's the body of Christ
[58:34] that's why we lay hands on for the
[58:35] healing we lay hands on for the Holy
[58:38] Ghost but we're going to be able though
[58:40] to speak as God
[58:42] speaks oh don't get quiet on
[58:45] me brother brand I read you that quote
[58:48] about 10 sermons in a row he said it'll
[58:50] come to a time where you don't have to
[58:52] lay hands on the sick you'll speak the
[58:54] word and it'll happen
[58:57] amen well listen you're not going to get
[58:59] to it as brother Bob said we're not
[59:00] going to get to it and we come the
[59:02] prescribed way everybody come together

[59:06] random said he said look if if John's
[59:08] got the
[59:09] football why are you tackling John he's
[59:12] on your
[59:13] team all

[59:27] greatness praise him with the sound of

[59:48] Lord Praise ye the Lord Jeremiah 33:11
[59:53] says the voice of joy
[59:55] the voice of gladness the voice of the
[59:58] bridegroom and the voice of the
[1:00:00] Bride the voice of them that shall say
[1:00:04] praise the Lord of hosts for the Lord is
[1:00:06] good for his mercy endureth forever and
[1:00:09] of them that shall bring the sacrifice
[1:00:12] of praise into the house of the
[1:00:14] Lord bring it into the house of the Lord
[1:00:18] for I will cause to return the Captivity
[1:00:21] of the land as at the first sayeth the
[1:00:24] Lord
[1:00:25] Psalms 1471 says praise ye the Lord for
[1:00:28] it is good to sing praises unto our God
[1:00:31] everybody believes the Bible's right
[1:00:32] right you know it's not just out there
[1:00:33] for for just whatever no it has a it has
[1:00:36] a meaning all right Praise You the Lord
[1:00:38] for it's good to sing praises unto our
[1:00:40] God for it is pleasant and praise is
[1:00:44] comely listen God enjoys the worship of
[1:00:48] his Saints cuz listen nobody else knows
[1:00:51] how to
[1:00:53] worship
[1:00:56] nobody else knows how to worship the
[1:00:57] true God except the bride amen all
[1:01:03] right so let's read this real quick and
[1:01:05] then we'll be done brother R tells us in
[1:01:08] 1954 he said we sing those songs and it
[1:01:12] lights up our
[1:01:15] countenances to think after 10,000 years
[1:01:18] we'll have no less time but you know now
[1:01:21] is the time we got to work for the Lord
[1:01:23] isn't it the only time that we have is
[1:01:26] in this little span of mortal life while
[1:01:28] we're here and I believe that it
[1:01:30] behooves us to put every minute that we
[1:01:32] can in the Lord's service doing
[1:01:35] something no matter what it is if it's
[1:01:37] singing testifying doing something for
[1:01:40] the glory of the Lord for just think
[1:01:42] we're just going to sing 10,000 years
[1:01:44] after we get there that's just a song
[1:01:48] service it's just it's not quite over
[1:01:50] that you know 10,000 years so it's going
[1:01:52] to be a wonderful time he continues on
[1:01:55] in in the sixth um paragraph now same
[1:01:59] sermon now don't want to take too much
[1:02:01] of your time for I know tomorrow's
[1:02:02] Monday work day during the time of the
[1:02:04] Revival if God willing we just want to
[1:02:06] find a good hour and a half or two hours
[1:02:08] of a Night song service and they go
[1:02:10] right into the teaching of the word and
[1:02:12] I think that songs are marvelous but we
[1:02:14] can ruin a meeting by songs all right
[1:02:16] well here we go on the other side all
[1:02:18] right we can sing too
[1:02:21] long
[1:02:23] okay too many of them see we can sing
[1:02:26] but what the house of God is is for
[1:02:28] correction for the word for
[1:02:30] understanding and instruction that we
[1:02:32] know how to behave oursel and I think we
[1:02:35] got I think you got your songs just fine
[1:02:37] now just like it was tonight he's
[1:02:39] talking about the worship service that's
[1:02:41] very fine now here's 1959 they asked him
[1:02:44] a question about conducting a service he
[1:02:48] said after a while they begin to hear
[1:02:49] the bell ring you remember the old
[1:02:51] church bell we used to have them at at
[1:02:53] gills they all them church bells would
[1:02:55] start ringing well you knew that was a
[1:02:57] call to service all right church has
[1:02:59] begun to take up then they bring these
[1:03:01] messages he's talking about tongues and
[1:03:04] interpretation should not be in a
[1:03:06] congregation while the service is going
[1:03:08] on see that's where they missed it where
[1:03:10] they would jump up brother Brown be
[1:03:12] preaching or somebody be preaching they
[1:03:13] jump up and give a a tongu an
[1:03:15] interpretation and it'd be the Lord they
[1:03:18] just couldn't control their s right but
[1:03:21] he said the way to do it is is to take
[1:03:23] those people with gift put them in a
[1:03:25] room before the service starts let them
[1:03:29] prophesy or speak in tongues and
[1:03:30] interpret and write it down the piece of
[1:03:32] paper and then you put it up here on the
[1:03:34] platform and then then the minister
[1:03:37] reads that interpretation that's the
[1:03:39] correct way of doing it then they bring
[1:03:42] these messages lay them right here on
[1:03:43] the desk right here is where they're
[1:03:45] supposed to be laying I'm off somewhere
[1:03:48] studying praying after a while I walk
[1:03:50] out after the songs are being sung the
[1:03:52] church is all in order people coming
[1:03:55] sitting meditating praying that's what
[1:03:57] you're supposed to do not come to church
[1:03:59] and talk to one another not come you
[1:04:02] come to church to talk to God that's why

[1:05:44] out but I'm I'm being I'm trying to make
[1:05:47] it funny but it's not really not I mean
[1:05:48] some were really they needed they needed
[1:05:51] Deliverance before the preacher came out
[1:05:53] right and some of the deacons or some of
[1:05:55] the sisters will come up and help them
[1:05:57] lay hands I've seen that several times
[1:05:58] not not here cuz we've just not done
[1:06:00] that but in some Services they are
[1:06:02] welcome to come up and pray around the
[1:06:04] altar before the service starts and you
[1:06:06] sure are welcome to do that and we'll
[1:06:08] pray with you if you need it listen we
[1:06:10] want to get everything right cuz we know
[1:06:12] one thing for sure the devil's here
[1:06:13] before you get
[1:06:15] here he's right here before you get here
[1:06:18] he like I said before he comes to church
[1:06:19] when you
[1:06:21] don't the church is in travail
[1:06:24] Christians are praying they got their
[1:06:26] positions they're not sitting around
[1:06:28] chewing chewing gum saying hey ly give
[1:06:31] me some of your lipstick I want you know
[1:06:32] you know I need you know the other day
[1:06:34] when I was down there shopping I tell
[1:06:35] you I almost stepped on your toes that I
[1:06:38] ever seen such what do you think about
[1:06:40] that oh mercy and call this the house of
[1:06:42] God why it's a disgrace the body of
[1:06:45] Christ coming together there we set amen
[1:06:49] all right the men sitting by say you
[1:06:52] know when we went over there there're so
[1:06:54] so and so and so that's all right
[1:06:55] outside but in here it's the house of
[1:06:58] God we didn't come to talk to nobody but
[1:07:01] God when you come in this room all right
[1:07:04] come in praying take your positions I'm
[1:07:07] talking now not to your churches
[1:07:08] Brethren I don't know what you do I'm
[1:07:10] talking to this Tabernacle cuz this is
[1:07:12] and I'm talking to you today I'm talking
[1:07:14] to my own back door see that's right now
[1:07:16] when you come in like that then the
[1:07:18] first thing you know the pastor walks
[1:07:19] out he's freshly he don't have to be
[1:07:22] answering this that or the other he he's
[1:07:24] coming right out at the doe of his
[1:07:25] ministry he's been under the power of
[1:07:27] the Holy Spirit he walks right into
[1:07:29] where more tongues of fire are gathered
[1:07:33] together that makes a song that makes a
[1:07:36] service to go from singing To Worship
[1:07:38] into the ministry and then if you need
[1:07:41] something afterwards there's always an
[1:07:43] altar call the altar is always open and
[1:07:46] uh and I have during some of the youth
[1:07:48] meetings I've seen when brother Ron and
[1:07:50] different ones were preaching and the
[1:07:51] power of the Lord strike the the uh the
[1:07:54] people and and he'd be preaching away
[1:07:56] and still be preaching had been
[1:07:57] preaching 30 minutes and and three or
[1:07:59] four people come to the altar well
[1:08:00] praise God one of you deacons or one of
[1:08:02] you preachers you get up and you come
[1:08:03] over here now I don't can't leave here
[1:08:05] you don't leave them your post of Duty
[1:08:07] this is the the the spirit of the
[1:08:09] Prophet subject to the prophet so we
[1:08:11] continue preaching somebody comes up
[1:08:13] prays with them that ain't going to
[1:08:15] bother me none that actually is going to
[1:08:17] help cuz if they something they got
[1:08:19] cloudy in their brain or in their body
[1:08:21] and they come up here and get rid of it
[1:08:23] going to make it easier for for the
[1:08:24] service to go I want our services to be
[1:08:28] worship that's my last thought I want it
[1:08:30] to be a worship and worship God not be a
[1:08:33] formality not be a let's open and and
[1:08:37] you know brother Brown does tell us now
[1:08:39] he does he does tell us in in certain
[1:08:41] places in Condor and Doctrine he'll tell
[1:08:43] you he'll say um open a service a couple
[1:08:47] of congregational maybe a he calls it an
[1:08:49] outstanding special take up the offering
[1:08:52] bring the pre preacher out that's okay
[1:08:55] he's trying to set parameters for us not
[1:08:58] to get away from all right not 30 songs
[1:09:02] 10
[1:09:05] testimonies and and then the preacher
[1:09:07] comes out and you're wore
[1:09:09] out but we do it right here I mean we do
[1:09:12] as as we as we all have done before if
[1:09:15] you if you hear feel the spirit sing one
[1:09:18] more
[1:09:19] song if something's not right please
[1:09:21] sing another
[1:09:22] song then when you feel like led to
[1:09:25] bring the preacher out you bring the
[1:09:26] preacher out doesn't matter if it's me
[1:09:28] or anybody else you do that you song
[1:09:30] leaders and different things I don't
[1:09:32] want you just go now we just going to
[1:09:33] sing these two songs and then we going
[1:09:35] to take up an offering and then we're
[1:09:36] going to and that's okay but let's let
[1:09:39] the spirit lead us not a piece of
[1:09:42] paper but I also agree with brother Joe
[1:09:44] though you need to at least give us a
[1:09:46] give them a format you're doing that so
[1:09:48] the musicians are not fumbling through
[1:09:49] looking for you know this worse than
[1:09:52] anything is this you know 10 minutes try
[1:09:55] everybody trying to find the that's why
[1:09:57] I like that's why that's why I
[1:10:00] lobbied with my
[1:10:03] father several years ago to have
[1:10:07] these cuz I'll promise you most of you
[1:10:10] is too lazy to open the
[1:10:12] book cuz you mumbles the verses but we
[1:10:16] all pretty much know the course so the
[1:10:18] voices everybody goes up when the when
[1:10:20] the course then it goes down if they
[1:10:21] don't put that up on the screen y'all
[1:10:23] are mumbling right yeah hello somebody
[1:10:25] am I at home or not y'all are mumbling
[1:10:28] you
[1:10:29] going till you get to the course then
[1:10:32] you pretty much know the course but you
[1:10:33] don't know the you don't know the verses
[1:10:35] but now that they have the verses up
[1:10:37] here for us you can sing and sing
[1:10:40] without looking for the book listen you
[1:10:43] can don't have to thumb through your
[1:10:45] Bible to find scriptures I got them all
[1:10:47] right there for you I got the quotes
[1:10:49] there for you we are lay out of sea
[1:10:52] folks
[1:10:58] lazy no but there's a there's a balance
[1:11:01] to that right there really is a balance
[1:11:03] to it I Want You To Worship that's why I
[1:11:05] want the song leaders to have a lapel
[1:11:07] mic if you can if you can stand it cuz
[1:11:10] you can do this you can do this you can
[1:11:12] point you can do all but if you got a
[1:11:14] it's like I always say I can't preach
[1:11:15] with an ice cream comb in my hand I just
[1:11:18] can't do that some can I can't all right
[1:11:20] last time I did it I hit a guy in the
[1:11:21] head with it so
[1:11:24] an interpreter I told him not to follow
[1:11:26] me I he was interpreting in French and I
[1:11:28] turned around said something when I did
[1:11:29] I had it in my left hand and I turned
[1:11:30] around to motion to point and I forgot
[1:11:32] to put it in his hand point I did like
[1:11:34] that and hit him right between
[1:11:36] KN it woke most of the church up they
[1:11:38] had a shouting time after
[1:11:42] that they were all Haitians they
[1:11:50] wow but don't come in here 5 minutes
[1:11:53] before service starts
[1:11:55] okay you ought to know
[1:11:58] better you ought to you ought to come
[1:11:59] you ought to know you got to come in if
[1:12:01] you don't then you got a problem with
[1:12:02] pride and we need to pray for
[1:12:08] that oh I don't need that listen there's
[1:12:11] nothing in Christianity that I don't
[1:12:13] need nothing there is nothing that I
[1:12:17] don't need especially I need
[1:12:20] him but there's not a part of it and I
[1:12:23] am am Leary about people that says oh we
[1:12:25] don't have to do that anymore we don't
[1:12:28] have to take communion we're above that
[1:12:30] we don't have to take this ordinance
[1:12:31] we're above that well now who made you
[1:12:36] God who made you
[1:12:39] God I'm like brother brandom I'll tell
[1:12:42] you I'll read it where God put it in the
[1:12:45] Bible you read it to tell me where he
[1:12:48] took it
[1:12:49] out okay you read in the Bible and tell
[1:12:51] me how he took out all this worship he
[1:12:53] took out um communion he took out foot
[1:12:56] washing he tell me where he took it out
[1:12:58] we'll just quit and we'll just quit
[1:12:59] doing anything no he never took it out
[1:13:03] these are things we do as Christians we
[1:13:06] do them because we love God I don't take
[1:13:08] communion on first Sunday every mon just
[1:13:09] because I have
[1:13:10] to I want to I want god listen it's like
[1:13:16] brother Brown said and this closing here
[1:13:18] I is even if you're a Christian you got
[1:13:20] some doors you don't want God to play in
[1:13:26] well pray for me I
[1:13:28] do okay I got some doors I ain't ready
[1:13:30] for God to play in yet cuz he might find
[1:13:32] something that he don't
[1:13:34] like and I know one thing's for sure
[1:13:36] he's going to find something he don't
[1:13:38] like cuz I don't even like me myself and
[1:13:40] I'm standing inside the
[1:13:42] door you clapping for me for me oh okay
[1:13:46] I praise the Lord but let's be
[1:13:52] honest
[1:13:54] but worship should never be a drudgery
[1:13:58] though it should never be a drudgery you
[1:14:01] should never come to church and say I
[1:14:05] just really don't want to be here it's
[1:14:07] like at brother where brother Bob
[1:14:09] said they is the message
[1:14:12] Church well it's the last of the month I
[1:14:14] think I'll just come to
[1:14:16] church find me that in the b in the
[1:14:21] Bible the Bible says forsake not the
[1:14:24] assembling yourself together and much
[1:14:26] more as the day approaches all right I
[1:14:28] didn't write that God did so but we come
[1:14:31] here to worship I come here to get clean
[1:14:33] I am just dirty when I get
[1:14:36] here well bro you're the preacher you
[1:14:38] ought know
[1:14:40] how I got mine and y'all on my
[1:14:43] mind now I do and I appreciate that
[1:14:47] listen I I'm here for you guys you know
[1:14:51] I'm here for y'all so so
[1:14:54] um but take some of the to take some of
[1:14:58] the burden off get rid of it before you
[1:15:00] walk in the
[1:15:01] door okay get get rid of it before you
[1:15:03] walk in the door and we'll have a lot
[1:15:05] better
[1:15:06] service I don't want us to be sadf faed
[1:15:08] bunch of people I want us to be
[1:15:11] happy I want us to walk out of church
[1:15:13] service and say man not that not that
[1:15:15] I'm a good preacher but I want to say
[1:15:18] God spoke to me
[1:15:20] something to help me have you ever heard
[1:15:24] God speak to you that it didn't help
[1:15:26] you no I've never heard God speak to me
[1:15:29] and go well I didn't really need that no
[1:15:32] I need every word cuz he's the one that
[1:15:34] knows what I need when I need it and who
[1:15:38] it comes through for me to get it can
[1:15:42] you swallow that can you swallow that
[1:15:45] and who it comes through cuz listen we
[1:15:47] got a prophet that left us 1100 sermons
[1:15:52] we listen to it
[1:15:54] we Revere him but he's gone but his
[1:15:58] message is still
[1:15:59] here and we take that message and it
[1:16:03] molds into the Bible actually listen it
[1:16:06] is the Bible it's the Bible made
[1:16:08] manifest it's the B listen God has never
[1:16:11] lived in a group of people like he's
[1:16:13] living in them
[1:16:14] now never has he lived the way he wanted
[1:16:18] to in a group of people down through the
[1:16:20] church ages cuz they've had Scruples
[1:16:22] they've had this they've had dark times
[1:16:23] they've had they've had this kind of
[1:16:25] Doctrine and this kind of issue and this
[1:16:27] kind of denomination to fight which we
[1:16:29] do anyway but we know how listen brother
[1:16:31] rown said we have Satan's
[1:16:33] answer if you have Satan's answer use
[1:16:38] it use it and let's start by worship
[1:16:42] let's start by getting everything done
[1:16:44] before you walk in that door back
[1:16:46] there L on the Lord he said put your
[1:16:48] cares and your burdens on
[1:16:51] me and why did why did he say that he
[1:16:53] said cuz I care for you he said lay your
[1:16:56] burdens on me because I care for you I
[1:16:59] want you to have a good time listen this
[1:17:03] world is not going to get any
[1:17:07] better not going to get any better
[1:17:10] there's not going to be this great
[1:17:11] religion come up there's not going to be
[1:17:13] listen brother R said if Jesus came
[1:17:19] himself he not going to change what he's
[1:17:21] already said right
[1:17:23] this world's condemned it's done it's
[1:17:27] finished but you and I have a protection
[1:17:30] it's called
[1:17:31] Christianity it's called God in your
[1:17:33] soul and if God's in your soul then
[1:17:35] guess what it's got to come out amen
[1:17:39] Lord a
[1:17:41] fire not shut up in my bones we going to
[1:17:45] let it
[1:17:46] out and we're going to manifest it let's
[1:17:48] stand at our feet
[1:17:51] am brother Joe we we'll uh uh anybody
[1:17:55] have a need then we'll pray with you if
[1:17:58] not then brother joke and we like I said
[1:17:59] we'll give you about five minutes to yes
[1:18:04] sir yes we're going to do that just
[1:18:06] right here in just a second yes we are
[1:18:08] going to do that brother Aon brought it
[1:18:09] to our attention the other day and I
[1:18:10] believe it's a wonderful thing we'll do
[1:18:12] that very last thing before we dismiss
[1:18:15] is we'll have all the musicians and the
[1:18:17] song leaders come up to the front even
[1:18:20] though you're not playing anything right
[1:18:21] now I want you to come up here now
[1:18:23] uh and stand around the
[1:18:25] Altar and uh
[1:18:28] ministers
[1:18:30] um come on
[1:18:33] up and we're going to pray over our
[1:18:38] group
[1:18:40] um yeah just stay right there for
[1:18:44] now you
[1:18:46] pray the prayer of
[1:18:48] faith over these musicians song
[1:18:51] leaders
[1:18:53] listen without
[1:18:56] them it'd be hard to
[1:18:58] worship right that's why God loves his
[1:19:03] people to worship
[1:19:05] him because they worship Him in spirit
[1:19:07] and
[1:19:09] truth and
[1:19:11] you set the
[1:19:14] tone for us either struggling when we
[1:19:17] come out here and we do sometimes we
[1:19:21] struggle but it's it's really better if
[1:19:24] we don't struggle and let the Lord get
[1:19:26] to
[1:19:27] somebody didn't brother Brown say one
[1:19:29] unconfessed sin stop the whole
[1:19:30] congregation from getting something well
[1:19:33] one even though you're not involved
[1:19:36] what's it doing it's hindering this
[1:19:37] person standing here and he can't go in
[1:19:40] that direction because of a sin that's
[1:19:42] unconfessed or whatever you want to call
[1:19:44] it all right but I it would be let's get
[1:19:47] it confessed get it out you say well do
[1:19:50] I no there's no ritual list
[1:19:53] listen talk to go I talk to God I don't
[1:19:56] talk to God like thee thou and and all
[1:19:59] that I know you some of you giggling but
[1:20:01] that and that's right you hear people
[1:20:04] they pray and that's okay but when I
[1:20:05] talk to God it's like me calling Donnie
[1:20:07] up on the
[1:20:08] phone I talk to God like that he's my
[1:20:11] friend he's my buddy he's right
[1:20:14] here who do you talk to you talk to the
[1:20:17] one inside of you you don't have to you
[1:20:20] know you don't have to get up and H
[1:20:23] listen you don't even have to close your
[1:20:26] eyes please don't pray while you're
[1:20:28] going down the road and close your
[1:20:30] eyes okay but don't you talk to God with
[1:20:33] your eyes open it listen it's reverent
[1:20:35] to close your eyes we know that I'm not
[1:20:37] I'm not trying to be silly but let's
[1:20:38] don't if the Bible tells us to pray
[1:20:40] without ceasing you can't go through
[1:20:43] through your daily work with your eyes
[1:20:45] closed but you talk to God I talk to God
[1:20:48] just like he's standing right here and a
[1:20:49] lot of times he don't like to be
[1:20:50] standing right here he don't like me and
[1:20:53] what the stuff I do but he's still my
[1:20:55] friend he's still my listen he's my
[1:20:57] lover he's not going to move he's not
[1:20:58] move away he's my bridegroom I'm his
[1:21:00] bride you got to think of it like that
[1:21:02] he does not want to go away from he
[1:21:05] wants to stay right
[1:21:07] here and the intimate relationship is
[1:21:10] between you and him and nobody
[1:21:12] else right nobody else you and him and
[1:21:16] you can talk just like you talk to your
[1:21:17] brother and sister and different
[1:21:19] ones don't argue with him okay don't
[1:21:23] argue with him but talk to him say Lord
[1:21:25] It's been a bad day I need some
[1:21:28] help do we understand God like that we
[1:21:31] should as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:33] understand that God is Not somewhere you
[1:21:35] got to go through a telephone line you
[1:21:37] got to go through a satellite then you
[1:21:39] got to get to an angel then the Angel
[1:21:41] takes a piece of paper to the Holy Ghost
[1:21:43] and the Holy Ghost takes a pie piece of
[1:21:45] paper to
[1:21:46] Jesus now what did he tell us he said
[1:21:50] he's na thee even in thy mouth the word
[1:21:54] of faith that you preach he's right here
[1:21:58] you talk to him like that talk to him as
[1:22:00] he's your friend you buty you young
[1:22:01] people talk to him as your friend as
[1:22:03] your buddy you said well I'm a girl God
[1:22:05] understands that okay listen he's all
[1:22:09] knowing so he knows your problems he
[1:22:11] knew it before he even had them but he
[1:22:13] wants you to confess he wants you to
[1:22:14] talk to him listen why do he make us he
[1:22:17] didn't need us did God need us uhuh he's
[1:22:20] self-sufficient he's Elohim he's
[1:22:22] self-existing he don't need air to
[1:22:24] breathe he don't need us to stand around
[1:22:26] this pull pit to be
[1:22:28] God but he does love worship and we were
[1:22:32] inside of him worshiping not his people
[1:22:35] but in his his DNA and now here we are
[1:22:41] we're out here now giving praise back to
[1:22:43] the one that we love so let's bow our
