[0:00] y'all wanna sit down for a minute please
[0:01] if you don't mind I thought to make it
[0:03] as quick as I can but it's come to our
[0:06] attention that there's a couple people
[0:07] gabbing I know that are struggling with
[0:09] depression and it's a spirit that she
[0:12] and I both dealt with when we were
[0:13] teenagers back before we met before we
[0:16] knew one another and so I want to
[0:18] testify to help those folks and let
[0:21] y'all know that we're standing here with
[0:22] you and fighting the battle but it's
[0:25] ultimately your demon to overcome if
[0:27] you're struggling with depression and
[0:29] it's not just for those that we know of
[0:30] it's also for these teenagers because I
[0:33] know that teenagers are very susceptible
[0:35] to that spirit and if you haven't faced
[0:37] it already you likely will some day lust
[0:39] and depression those things the devil
[0:41] tends to attack especially young people
[0:42] with someone tell you how overcame I
[0:45] testified at the Alabama camp of 2006
[0:47] don't know if I ever testified here but
[0:50] at any rate I went through it during the
[0:52] age from 17 to 21 and especially in the
[0:56] latter part of that the last few months
[0:57] was very tough I thought about suicide
[1:00] often and it didn't even seem like
[1:02] suicide would do justice to it I was
[1:03] like job I curse the day that I was even
[1:05] conceived I wish I'd never been born
[1:06] that's how bad off I was but there's
[1:09] different reasons that people go through
[1:12] depression lots of different I call them
[1:14] triggers and for Gabby it was because
[1:17] she was an orphan girl from age 8 to age
[1:20] 16 she was sort of what you called
[1:22] downtrodden outcast every home that took
[1:25] her in as a foster kid they eventually
[1:27] kicked her out and she always just
[1:28] wanted a family that's what she begged
[1:30] called for she cried she she wasn't a
[1:32] Christian but she believed in God and
[1:34] she asked God for a family and
[1:36] ultimately age 15 she saw she probably
[1:39] gonna get adopted so she started trying
[1:40] to kill herself
[1:41] and she was very very uh upset very
[1:44] depressed well the Lord heard a prayer
[1:47] and gave her a family and they adopted
[1:49] her message believed in family so they
[1:51] introduced her to the message she came
[1:53] to know Christ she gave her heart to the
[1:54] Lord and believed the message and the
[1:56] Lord took away the depression and now
[1:58] she has family and Kentucky family here
[2:00] also Church family here in church family
[2:02] in Kentucky so God gave her the desire
[2:03] of a heart he's got family all around
[2:05] and no depression she's been free from
[2:07] depression for years and so of I so
[2:10] we're a testimony that you can live
[2:12] without depression
[2:13] you won't have it the rest of your life
[2:14] if you'll just fight it part of the
[2:16] reason that you succumb to that spirit
[2:19] is because you don't resist it okay if
[2:21] you embrace that spirit lust or
[2:22] depression or anything the devil tempts
[2:24] you with when you embrace it in other
[2:26] words you dwell on the thought it will
[2:28] you know you will succumb to that spirit
[2:30] so you resist the devil not once but
[2:33] constantly you never stop resisting the
[2:36] devil okay it's not just a one-time
[2:38] thing then it's over with it's an
[2:39] overcoming just like Christianity itself
[2:41] is not a one-time decision it's your
[2:43] whole life long every day you decided
[2:45] I'm gonna do right every single day I'm
[2:47] gonna resist the devil and I'll show you
[2:48] how I did that what depression is if you
[2:51] don't know it's an oppressive spirit
[2:53] this is a known definition from my
[2:54] experience an oppressive spirit that
[2:56] causes one to lose your drive or your
[2:57] motivation your desire you don't want to
[2:59] get up in the morning you don't want to
[3:00] go to bed at night you don't wanna go to
[3:01] work you don't wanna go to church you
[3:02] don't want to go to school you don't
[3:04] wanna do anything nothing makes sense
[3:05] there's just no purpose and you don't
[3:07] feel useful to anybody that was to me
[3:09] what depression was here's some of the
[3:12] lies the devil told me he said Ron
[3:14] you're not a Christian you must not be
[3:16] because you're struggling with
[3:17] depression I count brother branham as a
[3:19] Christian brother branham wanted to kill
[3:21] himself he tried a couple times and I
[3:24] believe I read in a message the other
[3:25] day where he had an oppressive spirit
[3:27] come on him every 7 years in his life I
[3:29] don't know if y'all remember that some
[3:31] nervousness or something whatever it was
[3:32] if you're struggling with depression it
[3:35] don't mean you're abnormal it don't mean
[3:36] that there's something wrong with you it
[3:38] doesn't mean you're not a Christian you
[3:40] just keep pressing the battle and don't
[3:41] stop never stop but they'll always tells
[3:44] us you know don't don't give up don't
[3:46] don't sit down don't stop don't what you
[3:48] call plateau you just keep going I mean
[3:51] whether you think you're born again or
[3:52] not you just keep pressing the battle
[3:53] okay and never stop that's been my theme
[3:56] for twenty years as a Christian is never
[3:58] stop and also Jesus was tempted to cast
[4:01] himself down the devil took him up to a
[4:03] pinnacle of a high place told him cast
[4:04] yourself down so order sounds like
[4:06] suicide but anyway God himself and flesh
[4:09] was being tempted you know when he faced
[4:11] things that we would face - and then the
[4:16] only difference between a Christian a
[4:18] depressed Christian and a depressed
[4:20] sinner is that the Christian has hope
[4:23] and as a sinner if a sinner struggled
[4:25] with depression I say get Jesus that be
[4:27] step one you know good case of salvation
[4:29] but the Christian has hope and your hope
[4:31] is the Word of God Jesus overcame by the
[4:33] Word of God and so do we
[4:35] every temptation he faced he found a
[4:37] scripture that was in opposition to that
[4:39] spirit and he withheld that was
[4:42] resisting the devil okay and I'll show
[4:44] you scriptures y'all go and put the
[4:45] Scriptures up there please you may not
[4:48] have a lot of word reveal to you but
[4:49] your hope it's the Word of God you'll
[4:51] find some promise in the Bible and hold
[4:53] on to that and you don't you can't do
[4:55] that if you don't read the Bible
[4:56] everyday read the Bible and pray every
[4:58] single day never forsake the assembly
[4:59] ourselves together be in fellowship read
[5:01] listen to sermons read sermons and you
[5:04] don't feel like doing that if you're
[5:05] depressed but I set and read through my
[5:07] crocodile tears having allows you y'see
[5:10] whew
[5:10] what was me time I said there were tears
[5:13] streaming on my face
[5:14] I read my Bible and pray and Satan
[5:15] saying why are you doing that I'd say
[5:18] well I don't know but I'm going to keep
[5:19] doing it anyway I'm not stopping I faced
[5:21] a lust demon I'm not gonna know the
[5:22] details of that but you know during the
[5:24] time I was facing a lust Eamon I turn
[5:27] around read my Bible and pray and you
[5:28] say we're on your hypocrite I'm not have
[5:29] been but I didn't stop you know you just
[5:32] don't ever stop here's a couple of
[5:35] Scripture this one I came across the
[5:36] other day this is not one that I used
[5:38] but I think it would be useful proverbs
[5:40] 10:28 the hope of the righteous shall be
[5:41] gladness that's your hope gladness not
[5:44] depression be glad next scripture please
[5:48] this is one of the ones that I use fun
[5:51] you can find many times at the Bible
[5:53] where it says rejoice this today was
[5:54] water made let's rejoice and be glad in
[5:55] it next one right rejoice evermore next
[5:59] okay Philippians 4:8 this is my what I
[6:02] count to be my new birth scripture but
[6:04] it's finally breathing you've heard the
[6:06] scripture what's everything true and you
[6:08] read through all those things says thank
[6:09] on these things okay next one this is
[6:12] what so the bowel tells us what to think
[6:14] about likewise it says what not to think
[6:15] about casting down imaginations every
[6:17] high thing that is all self against no
[6:18] one for God bring the captivity every
[6:20] thought to there be a surprised
[6:22] depression is not in obedience to Christ
[6:24] those thoughts you cast down you think
[6:26] on these things and then I'm trying to
[6:30] just be as quick as I can
[6:31] perseverance y'all remember brother
[6:32] Branham preached about perseverance
[6:34] listen that sermon read it look up the
[6:36] word tenacity
[6:37] I just recently look that word up it
[6:39] means to take a hold of something
[6:41] and grab it and hold it with all your
[6:43] might and never let go
[6:44] tenacity okay perseverance those two go
[6:47] hand in hand that's what a Christian has
[6:49] to be to overcome a Christian soldier
[6:50] okay you don't reason why you do or die
[6:54] every day you read the Word of God and
[6:55] pray don't care if you feel like it or
[6:56] not and then of course just good
[6:57] old-fashioned patience you wait on God
[6:59] because this took years I went through
[7:01] this spirit for years
[7:02] okay and kept reading my Bible and
[7:05] praying every day and crying and wanting
[7:07] to die all right
[7:09] scroll down I think there might be one
[7:10] more scripture I don't recall I guess
[7:12] that's it so my deliverance came after
[7:14] years of this struggling my deliverance
[7:16] Isis that came one day in 2006 I was
[7:18] praying and just really fed up sick and
[7:21] tired of being sick and tired
[7:22] I went as I often did just threw myself
[7:24] before the Lord threw myself on my floor
[7:26] in my bedroom
[7:27] and cried to God he finally spoke to me
[7:29] and he said you speak so I got up and I
[7:33] turned my prayer to the devil and I said
[7:34] Satan leave and that was when I was
[7:38] lifted from me and it's never been back
[7:39] since and then there was one of the
[7:44] voices that I heard there in that prayer
[7:46] and I can't explain this but it sounded
[7:49] like not one but multiple demons that I
[7:51] could hear within me crying and
[7:52] screaming as they were being cast down
[7:54] in fear it was very real and I've never
[7:56] been depressed since we're here with
[7:58] y'all we're praying with praying with
[7:59] y'all okay
[8:01] [Applause]
