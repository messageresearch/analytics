[7:47] upon us tonight Lord as we enter into
[7:49] these things in your name amen
[7:53] so Revelation 4 verse 1 says and I'm
[7:55] gonna get my phone out because I didn't
[7:57] put all of these scriptures in my notes
[7:59] um after this I looked and behold a door
[8:02] was opened in heaven and the first voice
[8:04] which I heard was as it were of a
[8:06] trumpet talking with me which said come
[8:08] up hither
[8:09] and I will show these things which must
[8:11] be that hereafter
[8:13] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[8:15] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[8:17] one sat on the throne and he that set
[8:20] was to look upon like a Jasper and a
[8:21] sardine stone and there was a rainbow
[8:23] round about the throne in sight like
[8:25] unto an emerald and a round about The
[8:27] Throne were Four and Twenty seats and
[8:29] upon the seats I saw Four and Twenty
[8:31] Elders sitting clothed in white raiment
[8:33] and they had on their heads crowns of
[8:35] gold
[8:36] and out of the throne proceeded
[8:38] Lightnings and thunderings and voices
[8:39] and there were seven lamps of fire
[8:41] burning Before the Throne which are the
[8:43] seven spirits of God and Before the
[8:45] Throne there was a sea of glass like in
[8:47] the crystal in the midst of the throne
[8:49] and round about The Throne were four
[8:50] bees full of eyes before and behind and
[8:53] the first Beast was like a lion and the
[8:55] second beast like a calf and the third
[8:57] Beast had a face as a man and the fourth
[8:59] Beast was like a flying eagle and the
[9:01] four beasts had each of them six wings
[9:03] about him and they were full of eyes
[9:05] within and they rest not day and night
[9:07] saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[9:11] which was and he is and is to come
[9:14] you may be seated the Lord has blessing
[9:16] to the reading of the word
[9:20] now that's that's a pretty amazing
[9:22] singing there that John was looking at
[9:23] and uh I I I thank God that we've had a
[9:26] prophet in this age to break these
[9:28] things down to us so that we can we can
[9:30] have something to peer into a a good
[9:33] explanation to to peer into what John
[9:36] was looking at there
[9:37] but I want to kind of back up and kind
[9:39] of to kind of review some of the things
[9:41] we've been studying out that at John
[9:43] there in verse one said after this I
[9:45] looked now you think about after this
[9:47] after this I looked and behold the door
[9:49] was open in heaven and John John heard
[9:51] that voice calling him up but after
[9:53] after this and you think about after all
[9:55] the things that he had seen in in
[9:57] Revelation chapter 3 that uh Church age
[10:00] is being laid out that that the church
[10:02] age is type
[10:04] it displays this picture of the of the
[10:07] Journey of the church from Ephesus all
[10:10] the way to laodicea that each Church age
[10:12] messenger preaching a message and
[10:14] opening up a door a way of Escape out of
[10:17] the carnality of the people the people
[10:18] the denominational system of that day
[10:20] away that they could get into the truth
[10:22] as God revealed at each age a little bit
[10:25] more word more word building something
[10:27] up but now look now in the Statue of a
[10:29] perfect man brother Brown said that as
[10:31] the church grows so does the individual
[10:33] grow so now you look at your own life
[10:35] and see now after after all these things
[10:37] after you come up after you come up
[10:39] through all these things that brother
[10:41] Wade's been reviewing all the way up to
[10:43] brotherly kindness now after all these
[10:45] things then God sent a prophet to us to
[10:48] preach a word
[10:50] to preach to preach a message to us to
[10:54] give us the full complete revelation of
[10:57] who Jesus Christ is now now see let's
[11:00] just lay it out real plain what's going
[11:02] to give you a Rapture and faith is a
[11:04] complete revelation of Jesus Christ when
[11:07] you have a complete Revelation now now
[11:09] that your soul not only your soul but
[11:11] your spirit has been redeemed that your
[11:14] spirit has been aligned to the word that
[11:16] you hold in your soul and that your body
[11:19] has been changed by the revealing of the
[11:22] word and that you are matching up with
[11:25] the word that God thought about you from
[11:28] the foundation of the world now you've
[11:30] got some matching pieces the matching
[11:33] pieces line up so that the word will
[11:35] draw the word now you've got a door
[11:38] opened up in heaven and that's what John
[11:41] said after this I looked and behold a
[11:42] door was opened in heaven and the first
[11:44] voice I heard was as it were a trumpet
[11:46] talking with me which said come up
[11:48] hither and brother Rama said that voice
[11:50] this was the same voice that spoke to
[11:52] him on Earth and we've been laying out
[11:53] this the same voice
[11:55] the same voice that's been calling you
[11:58] the whole time the same voice that was
[11:59] talking to John that whole time the same
[12:01] voice that was calling you from the time
[12:04] you you first heard that little that
[12:06] little tug and the little Mission
[12:07] meeting or the camp meeting or whatever
[12:09] it was the same voice that's been
[12:11] dealing with you all the time is the
[12:12] voice that called John up because John
[12:15] John types the bride so let's put
[12:17] yourself there in that situation put
[12:20] yourself there when you read that that
[12:21] John represents you
[12:24] and brother Adam said he was in the
[12:25] candlesticks speaking from them to his
[12:27] church the voice that when the church
[12:29] ages cease he left the Earth and moved
[12:31] up into the heavens and he called his
[12:33] redeemed up with him higher
[12:35] and what was it a revelation a
[12:37] revelation to come up higher and behold
[12:40] a door was opened in heaven now
[12:44] scripture's got a lot of places talking
[12:46] about doors and now if we can we can
[12:48] really just kind of uh let's let's not
[12:50] make it complicated let's let's get real
[12:52] simple let's go back to all these Bible
[12:54] stories that we we heard about when we
[12:56] were little kids listening to our Mama
[12:58] tell us Bible stories before we went to
[13:00] bed at night let's go back to some of
[13:03] the basics I remember there's a story of
[13:05] a door that was opened that no man could
[13:07] open or shut when Noah was preaching out
[13:10] there preaching to come into the ark and
[13:13] it was a door in the side of that ark
[13:15] that Noah didn't shut no Noah couldn't
[13:18] shut it and you know a lot of these
[13:19] pictures that are are that you you read
[13:22] in the Bible your little bible stories
[13:23] that you tell your kids and so forth
[13:25] that that noise that they depict that
[13:27] that door being great big a great huge
[13:30] thing that a man wouldn't be wouldn't
[13:32] have the strength to open or shut or
[13:34] anything I you think about now Noah
[13:37] preaching and preaching if you could the
[13:40] only way that you're going to escape
[13:41] death in that day
[13:43] was to get in that door into that door
[13:45] they are
[13:46] that was one door one door to that Ark
[13:50] that no man could open it or no man
[13:53] could shut it it had to be it had to be
[13:54] God Alone could shut that Ark and seal
[13:57] you and if you if you get in that Ark
[13:59] then you'd be saved now now see that's
[14:01] the Simplicity of what we're talking
[14:03] about here let's let's let's break it
[14:05] down tonight we're not talking about
[14:06] something that's beyond the reach of the
[14:08] little children we're talking about
[14:10] coming to a complete revelation of Jesus
[14:13] Christ and the door what is the door the
[14:15] door is Christ and the door is brother
[14:18] Brian will say the door is the Holy
[14:19] Ghost the door is the spirit the door is
[14:23] your revelation of who he is that when
[14:26] as you receive the word it's it's built
[14:29] up within you it's actually producing in
[14:31] you the same life that was in Jesus
[14:33] Christ and that Revelation and that life
[14:36] and the characteristics and all those
[14:38] things built up within you that is
[14:40] what's going to take you out of here
[14:42] now you see in Noah's day it didn't
[14:46] matter it didn't matter how good you
[14:47] were
[14:48] it didn't matter how how many soup
[14:50] suppers you went to how many birthday
[14:51] parties you went to how many events you
[14:53] went to a lot of times maybe we'll get
[14:55] caught up and thinking well if we can
[14:57] just get everybody to go to the event
[14:58] that I planned or all the different kind
[14:59] of things and we'll we'll be out we'll
[15:01] be real good Christians but we forget
[15:03] about the door it don't matter how the
[15:06] events and different things that you go
[15:07] to it as just being part of the assembly
[15:10] if you don't go in the door
[15:12] it's great to be real sweet and kind to
[15:16] one another and be good citizens and and
[15:18] do your civic duty and all those kind of
[15:21] things but don't forget about the door
[15:22] you got to go you got to get in Christ
[15:25] it doesn't do you any good to just be
[15:27] amongst the Believers in church and get
[15:29] around one another and fellowship and
[15:31] pay your tithes and all that kind of
[15:33] stuff if you if you forget about the
[15:35] door you got to come in the door because
[15:37] if you don't go in the through the door
[15:39] if you don't go get in the ark then
[15:42] you're you're gonna die
[15:44] you gotta get in the door or else you're
[15:47] going to die and the door the door was
[15:49] open to who whoever believed Noah's
[15:52] message
[15:54] oh could it be that simple
[15:56] now brother Brandon said in the conflict
[15:58] between God and Satan he said that's
[15:59] what we're standing today brother
[16:01] at the door of the Ark Christ is that
[16:04] door
[16:05] if you'll take that literally and want
[16:07] to work on it a little bit take over in
[16:09] Revelations between the Philadelphia and
[16:10] the layout of cnh he said I set a door
[16:13] open before you and you refused it see
[16:16] that's the hour We're living just before
[16:17] the destruction an open door but they
[16:21] wouldn't listen now they turned him
[16:22] outside now what's the open doors we'll
[16:24] study these things the store the door
[16:26] the door is Jesus Christ at each age the
[16:30] revelation of Jesus Christ grows and
[16:31] grows and grows until finally Martin
[16:34] Luther preached justification and John
[16:36] Wesley preached uh he what was John
[16:39] Wesley preaching he was preaching
[16:40] sanctification that God could take your
[16:43] new birth experience and and grow it up
[16:45] until you come to full stature that's
[16:48] what he was preaching because he would
[16:50] use scriptures like Ephesians 4 11 12
[16:52] and 13 talking about how we got to come
[16:54] to the full stature he would use that to
[16:56] explain his doctrine of sanctification
[16:58] that's why brother Brown said Martin
[17:00] Luther preached justification what was
[17:02] he saying Martin Luther preached the
[17:04] correct way to to be born again and John
[17:08] Wesley preached he preached further so
[17:10] that he was preaching that you got to
[17:12] grow that God will take your born-again
[17:14] experience and start taking away all the
[17:16] carnality from your life and begin to
[17:18] shape you into a stature and there's
[17:20] your open door it's opening up what the
[17:22] growth of the full the full
[17:24] understanding of who Jesus Christ is and
[17:27] and the door was set before him what a a
[17:31] more mature uh bring it bringing laying
[17:35] before him more of God and they turned
[17:38] it away when Azusa Street the baptism in
[17:40] the Holy Ghost was presented him before
[17:41] him and they turned it away and the
[17:43] further it's moving up into the higher
[17:45] realm of of the revelation of Jesus
[17:48] Christ and the denominations cabbage
[17:50] down on what they believed and rejected
[17:51] what God was given to them and
[17:54] Revelation chapter 4 part part one or
[17:57] the message the first message brother
[17:58] around priest he said there's only one
[18:00] way that goes into the body of Christ
[18:01] there's only one door to the Church of
[18:04] the Living God and Jesus is that door I
[18:07] am the door I am the way the road that
[18:09] leads to the door I am to the door to
[18:11] the Sheepfold now all the way down
[18:14] through the scripture Jesus Christ has
[18:15] always been the door and he's the door
[18:17] out of every Church age you hear that
[18:19] word and you could Glee you could leave
[18:21] the denominational idea and get into
[18:23] Christ and for second Corinthians 2 12
[18:27] Paul said furthermore when I came to
[18:29] trois to preach Christ's gospel and a
[18:32] door was open unto me of the Lord and
[18:34] brother Brown said the greatest
[18:36] missionary Endeavor of that age that was
[18:39] God Called It Paul called it a door that
[18:42] a door was being open what a a a a a
[18:45] greater opening of the the pouring out
[18:48] of the Holy Ghost God opening up a way
[18:50] for Paul to take that gospel the word
[18:53] that he was preached in a missionary and
[18:56] endeavor
[18:57] that would spread all over the world
[18:59] and he said who would dare deny the
[19:02] mighty Ministry of Philip who would did
[19:04] not dare to deny the mighty ministries
[19:06] of ireneus Martin Columbus Patrick and
[19:09] countless scores of others who have had
[19:12] God's anointing upon them yes the Bible
[19:15] Way is the real way of the open door
[19:19] work because the gospel being preached
[19:22] it opens up a way of Escape for you that
[19:25] you can get out of your carnality
[19:28] and he said a door had been opened in
[19:30] the Philadelphian age signifying the
[19:33] tremendous missionary effort of that age
[19:35] and in Revelation 3 8 it says I Know Thy
[19:38] Works behold I sit before thee an open
[19:40] door and no man can shut it for thou
[19:42] Hast a little strength and has kept my
[19:44] word and has not denied my name
[19:47] now now he said it did not have in the
[19:49] Philadelphian age it didn't have the
[19:51] open door of power it ought to have had
[19:53] noticing the same verse he mentions this
[19:55] open door he says Thou Hast little
[19:57] strength that's right the power of the
[20:00] spirit was missing in that age the word
[20:03] was well preached it was well able to
[20:05] make Souls wise unto salvation but the
[20:08] great power of God that showed forth his
[20:10] mighty works that made bear his arm and
[20:12] behalf of his own was missing except
[20:15] amongst the scattered groups yet praise
[20:18] God it was growing and had increased
[20:22] over what they had in the Reformation
[20:24] what's growing the more words you got
[20:26] what what is the word the word makes a
[20:29] way for the spirit the more word you
[20:31] have the more Spirit you have and the
[20:33] more Spirit the more power because of
[20:36] the word the word is your power the more
[20:39] word you've got so that's why he's
[20:41] saying it's growing it had increased
[20:43] over what they had in the Reformation
[20:45] reformation and at every age it grew and
[20:48] grew until finally now let's let's see I
[20:51] wanna
[20:53] I'm gonna skip down to this
[20:55] the power the full power the full
[20:58] anointing was restored and brother Ram
[21:01] said in the Philadelphian Church age he
[21:03] said he there was a little muhammadan
[21:05] woman that was the when he was over
[21:07] there speaking to the muhammadans
[21:09] they come to listen and hear what he had
[21:12] to say and the little Muhammad and woman
[21:14] came on the platform to be healed and he
[21:17] said now then if Jesus will come and
[21:18] reveal to me what your trouble is or
[21:20] what you are here for if he can tell me
[21:21] what your past is surely you can believe
[21:23] for the future
[21:24] she said through her interpreter yes I
[21:27] can I said all right may he do it those
[21:29] muhammadans were watching intently they
[21:31] were all leaning forward to see what
[21:33] would happen then the Holy Spirit spoke
[21:35] your husband is a short heavy set man
[21:37] with a black mustache you have two
[21:39] children you were at the doctors about
[21:41] three days ago and he gave you an
[21:43] examination you have a cyst on the womb
[21:45] she bowed her head and said that is true
[21:47] I asked her how is it you came to me a
[21:49] Christian why didn't you go to your
[21:52] mohabbatan prophet and she said I think
[21:54] you can help me I said I can't help you
[21:57] but if you receive Jesus Christ as your
[21:59] savior he who is here now and knows all
[22:02] about you he'll help you and she said I
[22:05] accept Jesus as my savior
[22:08] he said that did it now listen to what
[22:11] he's talking about he's talking about
[22:12] the power is being restored
[22:15] and he said she was healed and about ten
[22:18] thousand muhammadans came to Christ that
[22:19] day because the gospel was preached in
[22:21] both word and Power
[22:23] that the gospel or you ought to think
[22:25] about that when the gospel is preached
[22:27] in both word and power a full
[22:30] restoration of the word see that's what
[22:31] we're called for and they say not just a
[22:33] partial word not a partial understanding
[22:35] not a partial anointing but the full
[22:38] anointing of of the power of God back in
[22:41] the church revealing himself as the son
[22:42] of man back in the bride again he said
[22:45] God never told a man to labor 30 years
[22:47] and harvest nothing
[22:48] he gave us what did he give us he gave
[22:52] us the open door of word and power and
[22:56] that is what we are supposed to use that
[22:59] is what gave Paul his great and
[23:01] effective Ministry and the first and
[23:03] then he quotes First Corinthians or
[23:05] First Corinthians 2 4 and my speech and
[23:08] my preaching was not with enticing words
[23:11] of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of
[23:14] the spirit and of power now there you
[23:18] come into an Open Door in heaven a place
[23:20] a place where the bride is coming to
[23:22] where the full word is Back Being
[23:24] restored back where there's not you've
[23:27] got Clarity there's no confusion in your
[23:29] mind of what you're doing here and what
[23:30] your purpose is and whether God wants
[23:32] you to be healed or even whether God
[23:34] wants you to take a body change but you
[23:36] know where you stand
[23:38] what is it what is this door that I'm
[23:40] talking about it's the spirit of God
[23:42] working in his people again it's God
[23:45] restored back again the word restored
[23:48] back the spirit restored back it's God
[23:51] working in you and I it's deity actually
[23:53] making a way it's deity in you making a
[23:56] way for his word his person his life is
[24:00] the door you remember the parable that
[24:02] Jesus told whether the shepherd or would
[24:04] actually lay down in the Sheepfold and
[24:06] the shepherd would become the door and
[24:09] he would lay in there and all the sheep
[24:11] that were in the Sheepfold would be
[24:13] protected by the shepherd that's laying
[24:15] there because the shepherd becomes the
[24:16] door what is the ship the shepherd is
[24:19] the very life of the the it's the Life
[24:22] of Christ the country the complete
[24:25] Revelation the complete life of Jesus
[24:28] Christ has come back and brother I'm
[24:31] gonna say Jesus is the door he is the
[24:33] door of the sheep and notice that it
[24:35] speaks now of the door opening what is
[24:39] that but a revelation of him and that
[24:41] Revelation is opening up what to bring
[24:43] us strength to give you strength to
[24:46] illuminate the word those three things
[24:48] to bring us strength to illuminate the
[24:51] word and to glorify his name
[24:55] it was in the midst of the two last
[24:57] stages that the revelation of the deity
[24:58] of Jesus Christ blossomed out before us
[25:01] yeah we knew he was God how else could
[25:03] he be our savior but to know that he was
[25:06] only God or God Alone that he was the
[25:09] Alpha and the Omega that this Jesus was
[25:11] both Lord and Christ making him Lord
[25:13] Jesus Christ the Father the Son and the
[25:16] Holy Ghost to all one person that had
[25:19] been lost since the first church ages
[25:21] but now we are seeing it again the
[25:25] revelation of who he was had come back
[25:27] and that's why you see one on the throne
[25:29] the revelation of who he is it's opening
[25:32] up that's that picture that John saw
[25:34] he's seeing a picture of God's deity
[25:38] revealed the life of God God and that
[25:40] Emerald rainbow the all these things
[25:43] signifying the power of God the four
[25:45] beasts indeed godhead is not a
[25:48] three-person god with one personality
[25:50] for it takes personality to make a
[25:51] person if there was one personality
[25:53] there is one one person and but they who
[25:56] believe in three persons have a three
[25:57] God godhead and a guilty a break in the
[26:00] first commandment in Revelation chapter
[26:02] 4 when brother Brown preached this he
[26:04] said there's only one way that goes into
[26:06] the body of Christ there's only one door
[26:09] to the Church of the Living God and
[26:10] Jesus is that door I am the way I am the
[26:14] door I am the way the road that leads to
[26:16] the door I am the door to the Sheepfold
[26:18] he said he said to this church age I've
[26:21] set before you an open door he said to
[26:23] the Methodist Church age they turned
[26:25] away from it went in organization but
[26:27] I've set before you an open door now
[26:30] after they had received sanctification
[26:31] he said I'll put the open door which is
[26:34] what the Holy Spirit
[26:35] by one Spirit we are all baptized into
[26:38] one body which is Christ he said that
[26:41] message before the Methodist church and
[26:43] they turned aside from it they come up
[26:45] to sanctification and refuse the Holy
[26:47] Ghost remember that that open door they
[26:49] come up to sanctification and refuel
[26:52] what's that Holy Spirit way up there
[26:54] they turned they refused it how do you
[26:57] get into Christ by one Spirit Holy
[27:00] Spirit which is Christ's Spirit we've
[27:02] entered in not by handshaking not by
[27:04] sprinkling but by one the Holy Ghost
[27:06] baptism we are all baptized into one
[27:08] body and one made particulars of that
[27:11] body one Holy Ghost baptism into that
[27:13] door
[27:15] what and what is the Holy Ghost brother
[27:17] said it's God's Open Door the Holy
[27:19] Spirit
[27:22] what is it
[27:23] it's God's open door to all these things
[27:27] it's God's open door to Christ which has
[27:30] God proved that he raised up Jesus from
[27:33] the dead and those that are dead in
[27:35] Christ will God bring with him at the
[27:37] resurrection
[27:39] what is it it's the Life of Christ in
[27:41] the church
[27:42] the spirit of God is the open door
[27:45] now now if the spirit of God is the open
[27:47] door the spirit of God is what you need
[27:49] the spirit of God will make the word
[27:51] live so don't be afraid of it oh don't
[27:54] be afraid of it like Augustine was when
[27:55] he wrote down his experience about how
[27:58] the spirit of God was trying to come on
[28:00] him and he resisted it and wouldn't let
[28:02] it so many people they'll see they see
[28:04] the spirit of God to begin to move in a
[28:06] congregation the spirit of God began to
[28:08] move and people and they'll get afraid
[28:10] of it like the disciples when they were
[28:12] on that boat and they saw Jesus come
[28:13] walking across the water the very thing
[28:15] that they needed they were they got
[28:16] afraid of it
[28:18] an Open Door is set before you just like
[28:20] it was in Noah's day when he was
[28:22] preaching his heart out and only eight
[28:24] Souls got in that Ark
[28:27] all right what is the open door it's a
[28:29] door it's a way of Escape away out of
[28:31] your carnality and Away out of your
[28:34] temper
[28:35] away out of your hatefulness
[28:37] way out of your addictions
[28:39] an escape out of your sin and your lust
[28:43] and your pride and your worldliness it's
[28:45] a door out of this old sinful world
[28:48] God has provided a way of Escape oh you
[28:51] think about when we're when we're
[28:52] studying through the book of Hebrews all
[28:54] the things that we're seeing in this day
[28:56] as the word begins to open up to us
[28:58] these these are things that all the Old
[29:00] Testament Saints long to see Abraham
[29:02] longed to see these promises being
[29:04] fulfilled he was looking for a city
[29:06] whose Builder and maker is God the
[29:09] Saints of old long to see all these
[29:10] promises but now you and I are living in
[29:13] the day when these promises are being
[29:14] fulfilled like he in Hebrews chapter 12
[29:17] where Paul said but ye are come they
[29:20] couldn't they couldn't come to these
[29:21] things but ye or come unto Mount Zion
[29:24] you come to the thing that they were
[29:26] looking for ye are coming to Mount Zion
[29:28] and unto the city of the Living God the
[29:31] thing that Abraham was looking for he
[29:32] was looking for a city but you come now
[29:34] the city the city is this right here the
[29:37] city is is that you've come to this
[29:40] you've come to the revelation of the
[29:42] truth you've come to the to the baptism
[29:45] of the Holy Ghost that the things that
[29:47] they were only looking for but you've
[29:49] come to it he said you've come to the
[29:51] Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[29:53] company of angels to the general
[29:56] assembly and Church of the firstborn
[29:57] which are written in heaven and to God
[30:00] the judge of all and to the spirits have
[30:01] just been made perfect and to Jesus the
[30:04] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[30:06] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[30:08] things than that of Abel we we are here
[30:11] at the moment at the moment at the
[30:12] junction of time when a bride will come
[30:14] to maturity when the word all these
[30:17] promises are being fulfilled right in
[30:19] our sight
[30:21] I ought to think that the spirit of the
[30:23] Living God is what's going to catch us
[30:24] out of here
[30:25] two will be in the field and one shall
[30:27] be taken and the other left two will be
[30:29] grinding at the Mill and one will be
[30:31] taken and the other left and and John
[30:33] said he said the first voice which I
[30:35] heard was as it were of a trumpet
[30:37] talking with me that voice is still
[30:39] speaking today and that voice
[30:42] when it speaks it always causes a
[30:45] response in the Sheep
[30:47] oh doesn't it do something doesn't it
[30:49] just do something with God to know that
[30:51] God has prepared a way of Escape for you
[30:54] that God loves you enough to want to
[30:56] reveal himself to you that that you
[30:59] don't have to go down
[31:01] but you can go up that God's made a way
[31:04] for you to go up
[31:06] and John said immediately
[31:08] I was in the spirit
[31:10] oh you think now now when you really
[31:12] begin to meditate on the word you start
[31:14] to get in the spirit and you got to get
[31:16] in the spirit here's really what I'm
[31:18] taking my text from tonight you got to
[31:20] get in the spirit you when the world
[31:22] begins to be preached something begins
[31:25] to take hold in you and you begin to
[31:26] realize that it's possible for you no
[31:29] matter what kind of situation life has
[31:31] got you in your the devil's got you all
[31:33] cabbage down and it in your little
[31:35] little sphere of carnality and then the
[31:39] word begins to be preached and you begin
[31:40] to realize that God's got a promise
[31:42] laying there in the scripture for you
[31:44] now brother Ram said we've got to get in
[31:46] the spirit of the last days when the
[31:48] last days are here you got to get in the
[31:50] spirit
[31:51] you go to a dance hall you've got to get
[31:54] in the spirit of dancing or they won't
[31:55] dance let's let's just kind of sit on
[31:58] these things for a little bit tonight
[31:59] and just think about these things what
[32:01] he's really trying to get us to see that
[32:03] you go to a dance hall and you ain't
[32:05] gonna dance unless you get in the spirit
[32:08] of the things that are taking place
[32:10] everybody else in that place has dressed
[32:13] now if you're going to go to it
[32:14] somebody's going to a dance hall we
[32:16] don't believe in that kind of stuff but
[32:17] people that do that you go to a dance
[32:19] hall and the people that are going to
[32:21] dance are dressed for dancing they're
[32:23] there to dance and you start listening
[32:26] to the music and you're gonna start
[32:27] dancing because when you get in the
[32:29] spirit of that thing that you're there
[32:32] to do you go to the church you've got to
[32:36] get in the spirit of worship before you
[32:39] can worship you got to get in the spirit
[32:41] of worship before you can worship now
[32:44] all to think now brother Brown is saying
[32:46] you can't worship unless you get in the
[32:48] spirit of worship he said the world's
[32:51] got to get in this Spirit of the last
[32:52] days before the last days can come and
[32:55] we're in the spirit of the last days and
[32:57] God's promise that these things would be
[32:59] here and that's what we've got where in
[33:01] the last days and men and women are
[33:04] setting asleep and don't realize it now
[33:07] that's that's a spiritual condition
[33:09] where people can come to the house of
[33:11] God and they're just they're just there
[33:12] to just kind of sit there and be among
[33:15] people and see the problem is they're
[33:16] not going in the door they're not
[33:18] getting in the door they're not getting
[33:19] in the spirit of the thing they're not
[33:22] getting the spirit of what this message
[33:24] was sent to do this message was sent to
[33:27] get you out of your condition it was
[33:29] said to bring deliverance and what you
[33:31] do is you don't get in the spirit of the
[33:33] age you don't get in the spirit of what
[33:35] the message was sent to do you just you
[33:37] just you what people are doing is
[33:39] they're failing to get involved in the
[33:41] thing they're failing to give their all
[33:44] they're failing to get in their Spirit
[33:45] of reading their Bible and listening to
[33:47] the message and failing to get into the
[33:49] spirit of getting in their prayer clause
[33:51] and getting along with God and finding
[33:54] out whether it's really right or not now
[33:56] you know where you go online and you
[33:58] find out if you type in what does it
[34:00] mean to get in the spirit the dictionary
[34:02] definition says it means to become
[34:05] involved in to take part in something
[34:09] with enthusiasm in other words when it
[34:13] says get in the spirit it means it
[34:15] matters to you and you see what what the
[34:18] problem with many of us in this day is
[34:20] it just doesn't matter to us anymore we
[34:22] come to the house of God and it don't
[34:24] really matter to us we we're to be
[34:26] coming we're not expecting to hear from
[34:28] God anymore we're coming to just check
[34:30] off our list of things to do in the week
[34:33] and it does but it doesn't matter
[34:34] because our heart's not in it we don't
[34:37] really care I I wonder if you could look
[34:39] back in your life and remember when you
[34:41] first came to God and you just love God
[34:44] and what you didn't care so much about
[34:46] all the arguing and debating about which
[34:48] doctor was right or not but you just
[34:51] love oh God I wonder if we could go back
[34:54] to that first time remember remember
[34:57] when you love God and that's why you
[34:59] come to church and that's why you prayed
[35:01] and that's why you read your Bible cause
[35:03] you fell in love with Jesus Christ I
[35:06] wonder tonight if we've forgotten our
[35:08] first love because if you're in the
[35:10] spirit of the thing you'll be involved
[35:13] in it and you will love God you will
[35:15] love his word you won't you won't be
[35:18] aching and wondering when the preacher
[35:20] is going to close his Bible because
[35:22] it'll be something real for you there's
[35:24] something within you is crying out feed
[35:26] me God I want more of you
[35:31] it means to become involved in or take
[35:33] part in something with enthusiasm to
[35:36] start to feel as happy
[35:39] excited as the people around you
[35:43] oh if we can get excited about God if
[35:46] you can begin to get excited about God
[35:48] excited about coming to church
[35:50] something's going to happen what's
[35:52] brother Brown saying he's saying you got
[35:54] to get in the spirit before something's
[35:57] happening before something will happen
[36:00] that you oh to think now when you see
[36:03] when you see Christians worshiping and
[36:05] raising their hand and praising God and
[36:08] say it amen you might as well worship
[36:10] too because that's what we're here to do
[36:13] in church but even the preacher behind
[36:15] the pulpit is here to worship God that's
[36:17] what preaching is is worshiping God
[36:19] [Applause]
[36:21] that's why that's why I'm preaching the
[36:23] preaching really is the highest form of
[36:26] worship because I owe you to think about
[36:27] that to be able to speak life into
[36:29] somebody else to be able to speak
[36:31] encouragement to tell somebody else that
[36:33] if you look to Christ that God will take
[36:36] care of your problems if you're trusting
[36:38] him he'll carry you through oh that's
[36:40] worship right there you're entering into
[36:42] worship you're entering into something
[36:44] higher something will tell to be able to
[36:47] lead people in worship to tell them
[36:49] about Jesus Christ that's worship right
[36:52] there and when you see Believers in the
[36:54] house of God dress and ride and living
[36:56] right well you might as well dress right
[36:58] too get in the spirit when you see other
[37:01] people claiming their inheritance and
[37:03] claiming their promising living for God
[37:05] what you might as well too you might as
[37:07] well be encouraged and say if somebody
[37:10] else can receive it I might as well do
[37:12] it too when you my oh when you see
[37:14] somebody get being delivered of their
[37:16] bonds and just breaking out in Liberty
[37:19] you might as well too get in the spirit
[37:22] brother Brown said that's what the
[37:24] matter with this meeting tonight
[37:26] I want to think about that oh think
[37:28] about that as we enter into these
[37:30] weekends of the weekends meeting with
[37:31] brother William preaching that's what's
[37:34] the matter with this meeting tonight if
[37:36] you can't get in the spirit you don't
[37:38] see nothing
[37:42] I wonder if that's our problem tonight
[37:43] oh brother Bob if you could just make
[37:45] some charts if you could just make it
[37:47] more simpler then I could see it oh
[37:49] brother Wade if you could just preach it
[37:50] different then we'd see it well why
[37:52] don't you try getting in the spirit you
[37:54] get in the spirit and then you'll see it
[37:58] if you can't get in the spirit you don't
[38:00] see nothing he said that's what they did
[38:02] on the day of Pentecost they all stayed
[38:05] there and prayed till they caught in the
[38:07] spirit now how'd they get in the spirit
[38:09] I believe I don't believe they were just
[38:11] sitting up there in the upper room like
[38:12] knots on a log or or as brother Brown
[38:14] would say a bump on a pickle but they
[38:16] were sitting up there and they began to
[38:18] think about God told us if we'll wait
[38:21] there's a promise he said wait until you
[38:24] are undue with power from on high
[38:26] they've got to thinking about that oh
[38:28] you're starting to meditating on God's
[38:30] word and think about what he's saying
[38:31] and you're going to get in the spirit
[38:33] something to begin to take place when
[38:35] you begin to meditate on God's word they
[38:37] all stay there and pray to the god in
[38:40] the spirit and then got filled with the
[38:41] Holy Ghost and run out and act like a
[38:43] bunch of drunk people that's right they
[38:45] got in the spirit you know that's what
[38:46] prayer does prayer prayer when you go
[38:49] through your work day and all you hear
[38:51] is all the negativity at work and maybe
[38:52] all the negativity from from from family
[38:55] members and everything then you just get
[38:56] along with God and you start aligning
[38:58] your thoughts with what he said and you
[39:01] begin to speak it back and let him speak
[39:03] to you and you ain't thinking about the
[39:05] stuff that your co-worker told you but
[39:07] you're thinking about what God Said and
[39:09] you begin to you begin to meditate on
[39:11] him and oh that's when something begins
[39:13] to take place why because you're getting
[39:15] in the spirit you're getting in the
[39:17] spirit of worship you're getting in the
[39:19] spirit of Praise because you begin to
[39:21] pray and you begin to thank God for what
[39:22] he's done take it for what you know he's
[39:25] going to do and thank you for his word
[39:27] and you begin to praise God in the
[39:29] private of your own prayer closet that's
[39:31] when you begin to get in the spirit and
[39:33] when you begin to get into Spirit
[39:34] something's going to happen
[39:37] he said you know that's what's the
[39:39] matter with the church today it don't
[39:41] get in the spirit enough we're too much
[39:43] in ourselves my if you'll just get out
[39:46] of yourself long enough
[39:48] you say well you know our church is we
[39:50] we have a regular routine isn't there in
[39:52] our problem or not tonight we got this
[39:53] routine that we gotta we gotta do
[39:56] everything we got to just sing so many
[39:57] songs and do so much and then go out to
[40:00] eat and everything but all when the
[40:01] spirit comes when the spirit comes
[40:04] you're going to get out of your routine
[40:05] when the spirit begins to break loose
[40:08] and people begin to praise God it don't
[40:10] matter so much about rushing out to go
[40:11] eat something does it it don't matter so
[40:14] much about rushing out to go sit at
[40:15] somebody's house when the spirit begins
[40:17] to move in the meeting when you begin to
[40:19] praise God and really break loose and
[40:21] something begins to happen and somebody
[40:23] get begins to get delivered then all
[40:25] that matters is God and you because
[40:28] you're in love with God off God could
[40:30] take us back to work to our first love
[40:32] take us back to where it really meant
[40:34] something to us
[40:36] that's what brother Brown said the
[40:37] matter with us is he said we're too much
[40:40] in ourselves if you'll just get out of
[40:42] yourself long enough well you know our
[40:44] churches we got a regular routine who
[40:46] cares about your routine that's what
[40:48] brother Brown said do you all believe
[40:50] brother Brown was a prophet who cares
[40:53] about your routine I wish you'd get out
[40:56] of the routine long enough to get saved
[40:58] anyhow get saved get out of the routine
[41:00] we don't care about the routine get in
[41:03] the spirit then you can see things done
[41:05] now you can't do any good
[41:08] this is another quote the brother mama
[41:10] said you can't do any good until first
[41:13] you get in the spirit
[41:16] God can't use you all your efforts are
[41:20] in vain until first you do it in the
[41:22] spirit
[41:24] to think about that
[41:26] that you ain't going to do no good to
[41:28] yourself or others or your relationship
[41:30] with God until you first get in the
[41:32] spirit you've got to get in the spirit
[41:35] oh to get in the spirit means that you
[41:37] come to the house of God expecting to
[41:39] receive
[41:40] you're going to get what you expect if
[41:42] you come to the house of God expecting
[41:44] to come expecting to criticize and say
[41:46] well I don't like how this was framed up
[41:48] and I don't like how this was said and
[41:49] done well all you'll go away with is a
[41:51] lot of things a long list of things that
[41:54] you didn't like but if you'll come to
[41:55] the house of God expecting to receive a
[41:57] blessing you'll get it because why
[41:59] because you're getting in the spirit
[42:01] you're getting in the spirit of worship
[42:03] and praise come expect them to get a
[42:05] blessing and come expecting to hear from
[42:07] God and come expecting the worship come
[42:10] expecting to see your life change come
[42:12] expect it to encourage and be encouraged
[42:14] you gotta want to be here that's what
[42:17] that's what getting in the spirit means
[42:19] you gotta want to be here you've got to
[42:22] lock it you've got to like being in
[42:24] church
[42:26] brother Adam said things begin to happen
[42:28] when men get in the spirit business
[42:30] takes place
[42:33] now remember the first thing you have to
[42:35] do is what get in the spirit
[42:37] how's these Revelations going to ever
[42:39] come to you get in the spirit how are
[42:42] you ever going to get the Holy Ghost get
[42:43] in the spirit get in the spirit get in
[42:45] the spirit say Lord Jesus I love you now
[42:48] reveal to me anything that you see fit
[42:50] just bring it into me then you're
[42:52] getting all right that's right that's
[42:53] the way he said that's the way you get a
[42:56] Revival it's when you really get in the
[42:59] spirit of Revival not whipping it up or
[43:01] something but by praying it down until
[43:03] there was a there's a Revival strikes
[43:05] your heart until all the logs of
[43:08] ecclesiasticalism and all the logs of
[43:10] fanaticism and all the logs of systems
[43:12] and all the logs of unbelief flows out
[43:16] and then the Waters of God comes falling
[43:18] down upon you
[43:20] there you are
[43:22] he said he's here tonight
[43:27] do you believe that and that's what
[43:28] brother round is asking
[43:30] what do you have to do
[43:32] get in the spirit
[43:34] and when you get in the spirit
[43:36] then you see the vision
[43:39] now that's what so many of us fail to
[43:41] realize that God is here he's you say
[43:44] well I don't I've seen listen I've seen
[43:45] so many times you'll watch you're
[43:47] watching a meeting there'll be somebody
[43:49] sitting in the congregation even while
[43:50] you're preaching somebody tears
[43:51] streaming down their face and right next
[43:53] to them there'll be somebody fast asleep
[43:55] with their head leaning up against the
[43:56] wall or whatever somebody will be
[43:58] getting a breakthrough and somebody else
[43:59] won't realize anything's going on why
[44:01] because one's in the spirit and one
[44:03] ain't realizing what's happening I've
[44:06] seen I've seen time after time you go
[44:08] somebody will raise up and begin to
[44:11] praise God and maybe run through the
[44:12] church and somebody will be over to the
[44:14] side just sleep acting like they don't
[44:16] know what's going on oh but if we could
[44:18] just if we could just awaken from our
[44:20] spiritual Amnesia and realize that God
[44:24] is here God is here and all that all
[44:27] that's necessary if you could just get
[44:28] in the spirit oh if we could just fall
[44:30] in love with God
[44:33] said get in the spirit of this meeting
[44:35] and every one of you be healed in the
[44:37] name of Jesus Christ
[44:39] now there's a nice incentive for you to
[44:42] get in the spirit that if you get in the
[44:44] spirit you'll receive your healing if
[44:46] you get what does that mean you sit
[44:48] there and you think it's not available
[44:50] to you and that the preacher don't care
[44:52] about you and that all we're doing is
[44:53] just kind of going through some
[44:54] formality and things but if you're
[44:56] getting the spirit and realize it's
[44:58] available to you and begin to think
[45:00] about the promises of God and begin to
[45:02] think that God loves you then you're
[45:04] something is going to happen
[45:06] to get in the spirit of something means
[45:08] to actively engage in and embrace the
[45:12] mood the atmosphere
[45:15] with a mindset associated with a
[45:17] particular event occasion or activity it
[45:20] involves adopting the appropriate
[45:22] attitude
[45:24] enthusiasm and participation to fully
[45:28] immerse oneself in the experience oh now
[45:32] that means that means to really get in
[45:34] the spirit then you start getting them
[45:35] blinders on where you don't care if
[45:37] somebody sees you say Amen you don't
[45:40] care if somebody sees you whatever run
[45:44] up down the aisle or if the spirit
[45:46] strikes you and it's time to praise God
[45:49] and say God deliver me well you don't
[45:51] care because now you're just in your own
[45:53] little world whether it's you and God
[45:55] Alone you're fully immersed in the
[45:58] experience of worship that's what we
[46:01] come here tonight to worship God that's
[46:03] when we come here tonight to receive
[46:04] something from him getting in the spirit
[46:06] implies actively aligning yourself with
[46:10] the essence and mood of a particular
[46:12] event occasion or activity and
[46:14] participate trading in a way that
[46:17] reflects its values Traditions or
[46:19] objectives now that's the formal
[46:21] definition that's not brother Brown's
[46:23] definition that's the definition that
[46:25] you can go look in the dictionary and
[46:27] see that's what it means to get in the
[46:29] spirit now see see how maybe you've
[46:32] heard it growing up you've heard a
[46:33] preacher say well you've got to do this
[46:35] or that to get in the spirit no you just
[46:38] got to be willing
[46:40] to immerse yourself in the experience
[46:43] it's not whether you jump up or shout or
[46:46] whether you cry or whether you say Amen
[46:48] 100 times during the service but just
[46:51] get in the spirit of worship
[46:54] come on now now teach teach what is
[46:57] teaching positioning places you so let's
[46:58] just really lay it out
[47:01] how can I get in the spirit
[47:04] here's some guidelines how can I really
[47:07] get in the spirit prepare yourself
[47:09] spiritually take time to pray and
[47:13] meditate on the word of God and reflect
[47:15] on it with your heart and your mind
[47:18] because if you ain't reading your Bible
[47:20] and you're alone time
[47:21] if you're not studying the scripture if
[47:23] you're not if you're not reading the
[47:24] message if it's just Gathering dust on
[47:26] yourself you're not getting in the
[47:28] spirit
[47:29] seek to cultivate a receptive and open
[47:32] mindset
[47:34] and invite the presence of God to work
[47:36] in your life
[47:38] every morning when you wake up you just
[47:40] say your morning prayer do like your
[47:43] mama taught you when you're a little kid
[47:44] and at night before you lay your head on
[47:46] your pillow
[47:47] spend some spend some time start five
[47:50] minutes praying to God and that five
[47:52] minutes will grow until until you're
[47:54] really getting in the spirit dress
[47:56] appropriately when you go to a ball game
[47:59] the ball team is dressed appropriately
[48:01] for the event and when you come to
[48:03] church you're going to dress according
[48:05] to getting in the spirit of worship your
[48:07] dress you're dressing like everybody
[48:09] else in the church does not not just
[48:11] because everybody else is doing it but
[48:13] you're dressing for the event if you're
[48:15] going if you go to a dance people are
[48:17] going to dress for dancing if you go to
[48:19] a ball game they're dressing for for a
[48:20] ball game but we dress because we're
[48:22] here to worship God and so to worship
[48:24] God to really enter into a state of
[48:26] worship with God you're dressing the way
[48:28] he told us to we're dressing for our
[48:30] destination we're dressing we're
[48:32] dressing for our future home we're
[48:34] dressing because he told us to clothe
[48:36] ourselves our soul all is clothed and
[48:39] our outward appearance is clothed with
[48:41] righteousness and when you when if you
[48:44] really want to get in the spirit you've
[48:46] got to participate in worship you've got
[48:48] to actively engage in the worship
[48:51] portion of a meeting in other words that
[48:53] means that means that when people are
[48:54] singing along with hymns and courses
[48:56] that you don't just sit there with your
[48:58] mouth closed and say well I'm not doing
[49:00] it I'm not seeing I don't think that I
[49:03] sing really good but you you because you
[49:05] want to get in the spirit of worship
[49:07] you're going to open up your mouth and
[49:09] you're going to sing praises to God
[49:11] because that's what we do in church
[49:12] we're here to worship you're going to
[49:14] sing and you're going to clap your hands
[49:16] and you're going to raise your hands and
[49:18] praise God and say Amen because that's
[49:20] how you get into worship
[49:23] oh now
[49:26] come on now y'all know that's the truth
[49:28] y'all know these things that I'm saying
[49:30] are not just to be hateful but these
[49:32] things are to be a blessing to you to
[49:34] encourage you so that you can really you
[49:37] can really praise God and worship the
[49:39] way he wants you to
[49:41] all God has given us the liberty to be
[49:45] able to think that
[49:47] when we raise our hands it's to give him
[49:49] praise and worship and honor and
[49:51] thankfulness for bringing us out of our
[49:53] carnality in the way that we used to
[49:55] we've got something to worship he's
[49:57] given us a word and an understanding in
[49:59] this day that we should we should have
[50:01] more than enough to worship him for
[50:04] um
[50:05] you know another way that you can enter
[50:07] it get in the spirit is to listen to the
[50:10] preaching
[50:11] pay attention to the sermon pay
[50:14] attention to the Sunday School lesson
[50:16] whoever it is given the message listen
[50:19] to it listen to brother Branham at home
[50:21] listen to what he's saying take notes
[50:25] when you're when you're in church take
[50:27] notes and write things down and think
[50:29] about what's being said and be receptive
[50:32] to the teaching if you're sitting there
[50:34] you know saying well I it ain't for me
[50:35] and I don't care I don't like that and
[50:37] all those kind of things that's not
[50:38] getting in the spirit but seek if you
[50:41] come with a with a heart that's willing
[50:43] to seek and apply the principles to your
[50:46] life and grow and let these things be
[50:48] edifying to you then you're going to be
[50:50] you're going to be getting in the spirit
[50:52] oh if you listen to the preaching
[50:54] prepare spiritually dress for the
[50:57] occasion participate in worship listen
[51:00] to the preaching I'm talking about
[51:01] really listening let it let it soak down
[51:04] in my heart oh something that I can hang
[51:07] on to I
[51:09] listen a real sheep wants to be fed
[51:12] a real sheep wants that word
[51:15] and seek personal experience seek a
[51:19] personal experience with God
[51:21] oh it's not enough to get in the spirit
[51:23] to just once a week once when's denied
[51:25] or on Sunday morning to just come to
[51:27] church and not see it now you got to
[51:29] have a personal experience for yourself
[51:30] you've got to have a burning bush
[51:33] experience for your own self on the back
[51:35] side of the desert you and God where you
[51:37] see that God is real and that's that's
[51:42] getting in the spirit
[51:44] no you got to you got to be open to
[51:47] experience a spiritual manifestation in
[51:49] your life you got to be constantly
[51:51] looking for God to find your car keys
[51:54] and find your wallet and help with your
[51:56] lost children and give peace to your
[51:58] family and looking for miracles in your
[52:00] life and then praying over your wife
[52:02] laying there in the bed when she's got
[52:04] an ache and her pain and asking her to
[52:06] pray for you and constantly looking for
[52:08] God to do something in your own life oh
[52:11] that's getting in the spirit constantly
[52:13] day by day everywhere you place your
[52:15] feet on that through the day you're
[52:17] looking for God to do something
[52:19] it is essential to approach all these
[52:22] experiences with discernment and in
[52:24] accordance with your own beliefs and
[52:26] comfort level just you gotta you gotta
[52:28] constantly be seeking personal
[52:29] experience
[52:30] and you've got to engage with your
[52:32] community
[52:33] it's not enough to just come to church
[52:36] and say well I don't want to talk to
[52:37] nobody I don't want to some of the some
[52:40] of the greatest spiritual blessings that
[52:42] I've had is be able to get get counsel
[52:45] and advice from some of the older people
[52:46] in church younger people too it don't
[52:49] matter you we're sharpening whether one
[52:51] another is iron sharpens iron and if you
[52:54] really want to get in the spirit that
[52:56] you Fellowship one with another and you
[52:58] you break bread with another and you
[53:00] want to you want to be around other
[53:01] believers and I tell you if you really
[53:03] get a real revelation of the body of
[53:05] Christ that we are really really more
[53:08] family than maybe your natural family
[53:12] oh
[53:15] I I see my my wife and I the other day
[53:18] we were talking about it we were in
[53:20] different places in the house and it's
[53:21] like it just struck us both at the same
[53:23] time
[53:24] how much we love our church and how much
[53:27] and I'm not just saying this to make a
[53:29] good talking point but it just really
[53:31] just hit us that this is our family and
[53:34] why is it our family because this is the
[53:36] it's the spirit of God moving in the
[53:38] people it's the spirit of God that's
[53:40] uniting us and oh you see you see that
[53:43] kind of thing when you start meditating
[53:45] on that are you getting in the spirit
[53:46] and what's that going to do with your
[53:48] relationship with God it's going to
[53:49] start you making to love one another
[53:51] more it's going to make you enter into
[53:53] prayer more for the other person because
[53:56] now it's not just somebody else there at
[53:58] church just some old or young person or
[54:01] somebody else there that you just see at
[54:03] church but it's your brother or sister
[54:06] it's somebody that means something to
[54:09] you and there you getting in the spirit
[54:11] what you're not just love it how can you
[54:13] love God if you don't love your brother
[54:14] but if you can if you really love God
[54:17] and you see you start seeing things
[54:19] different that'll make you talk to your
[54:21] brother and sister different that'll
[54:23] make you enter into different because
[54:24] you don't see him with just another
[54:26] another
[54:28] whatever
[54:31] but it's God tabernacling himself and
[54:35] that person in that vessel and your
[54:37] fellowship and not with just somebody
[54:38] else like a co-worker at work but you're
[54:40] a fellowshipping with god oh I hope
[54:44] these things are a blessing to you that
[54:45] you can see how that you can if you this
[54:47] will give you something concrete to
[54:49] apply to your life that tomorrow morning
[54:51] when you get up give it give some alone
[54:53] time to God and you'll you'll get the
[54:55] day and the week started off right oh
[54:58] Sunday Morning open up your Bible and
[55:00] begin to pray and think about things
[55:02] before you come to church think about
[55:03] how much you love God and how much you
[55:05] want to serve him how much you want God
[55:07] to take away the things of the world and
[55:09] get in the spirit of worship and when
[55:11] you come to church things will be
[55:13] different it won't just be another day
[55:15] where you can just check it off of your
[55:16] list but if you'll get in the spirit
[55:18] because the spirit is what gives life
[55:21] the spirit is the open door the spirit
[55:24] is Christ being made manifest in the
[55:26] members this is a living gospel a Living
[55:30] Word proven that Jesus Christ is alive
[55:39] if we keep going on in verse two
[55:42] immediately I was in the spirit
[55:44] and behold a throne was set in heaven
[55:47] you'll find out that the whole rest of
[55:48] this chapter is about the spirit of God
[55:50] his life in you
[55:52] his life in the bride looking at those
[55:54] four creatures the power of God and the
[55:56] bride the power of God and you God's
[55:59] sitting on his throne but but he's
[56:01] sitting on the throne of your heart
[56:04] and he that set was to look upon like a
[56:06] Jasper and a sword and stone and there
[56:08] was a rainbow round about the throne
[56:09] throne in sight like unto an emerald and
[56:12] brother Brown said in other words when
[56:14] you looked at him he was in such
[56:15] Splendor such beauty oh I want to see
[56:17] him oh I want to see him don't you
[56:19] that's what brother Ram said
[56:21] those stones the first was Reuben the
[56:24] last was Benjamin the birthstone of
[56:25] Reuben was Jasper and we talked about
[56:27] this last time that's talking about a
[56:29] process that God takes you he's the
[56:31] author and finisher he's the author of
[56:33] your faith and your finisher and he's
[56:34] taken you through a journey and those
[56:36] stones were typing a spiritual journey
[56:39] that he was the first and the last he
[56:42] was from Benjamin to Reuben from Reuben
[56:44] to Benjamin and all those stones
[56:46] typified like they they represented the
[56:48] birthstones of the children of Israel
[56:50] that when you placed them into the
[56:51] breastplate of the priests and then a
[56:54] prophet spoke you could tell whether
[56:56] that prophet's word was true or not so
[56:59] then you apply that to your own life and
[57:01] that if you if you place yourself
[57:03] positionally in the word of God and let
[57:06] a prophet speak over your life that you
[57:09] become the actual Vindication of that
[57:10] prophet's message so you're sitting out
[57:13] here the life that you live and the word
[57:15] that you have received become the
[57:16] Vindication of that prophet's message
[57:18] your life is the very Vindication the
[57:21] very vindication oh
[57:23] we were preaching on this last time when
[57:25] people see the life that you live and
[57:27] the way that you react to situations it
[57:29] becomes a living testimony
[57:32] once they see how you love
[57:34] and how you don't rile back and how
[57:37] you're patient with others and how you
[57:40] don't just lose control and get in Iran
[57:43] how you don't just berate somebody that
[57:45] gets on your nerves how you don't just
[57:48] crush somebody that that that says
[57:50] something that you don't like but the
[57:53] love of Christ is in you to be able to
[57:55] forgive oh you think about the gift of
[57:58] the Holy Ghost that God has given us to
[58:00] be able to forgive somebody
[58:03] to forgive somebody that's a gift that
[58:07] the world don't have because the world
[58:10] will hold a grud forever and ever
[58:12] they'll be like an elephant that won't
[58:14] forget now but the Holy Ghost gives you
[58:18] power to be able to forgive to be able
[58:21] to fellowship with somebody that Did You
[58:24] Wrong that treated you wrong years ago
[58:26] or maybe yesterday but the Holy Ghost in
[58:29] you can forgive just like Jesus did on
[58:31] his on the cross when he said father
[58:33] forgive him
[58:34] for they don't know what they're doing
[58:39] to be kind
[58:41] and long suffering
[58:43] ah
[58:44] when the prophet's word spoke across
[58:47] those stones the light flashed and it
[58:49] was a very Vindication of his message
[58:51] and the fruit and you the life in you
[58:54] actually vindicates the message that
[58:57] you've heard the fruit vindicates the
[59:00] tree
[59:00] you've got to have the life on display
[59:02] I'm skipping so do some of the I I
[59:04] really don't want to keep you late
[59:06] tonight I'm trying to
[59:08] I'm not going to do that the life is
[59:11] what listen if you want people to
[59:13] respect you the life is what people
[59:16] respect the world is looking for for
[59:18] that life to be on this play they're
[59:20] looking for somebody that when they're
[59:22] wrong they're not going to lash back
[59:24] that's what the statue of perfect man is
[59:27] for the perfect statue of a perfect man
[59:29] is to bring us to a place where you
[59:31] react the way that God would to a
[59:34] situation like brother random when he
[59:35] was standing there preaching and there
[59:36] was that couple sitting there kissing on
[59:38] one another
[59:39] but love took over and he didn't just
[59:42] crush him under his thumb he didn't just
[59:44] just speak a word to kill him but he
[59:47] spoke love
[59:49] oh that's what the world is looking for
[59:51] somebody they're looking for a mother
[59:53] and father that'll react with love to
[59:54] their children
[59:55] a mother and father they'll speak love
[59:58] back and maybe if their kids are going
[1:00:00] out in the world to speak love and say
[1:00:02] no matter where you go or what you do
[1:00:04] I'll always love you I'll always be here
[1:00:08] for you I don't care where you go I love
[1:00:10] you now oh if you can do that that's
[1:00:14] life on display
[1:00:17] the life is what the makes the demons
[1:00:21] tremble and you know real love brother
[1:00:24] Ram said to over over and over love is
[1:00:26] what casts out a devil if you can love
[1:00:29] somebody like that little woman that her
[1:00:30] husband come home drunk with all of his
[1:00:32] friends and she just sit there must
[1:00:34] Jesus bear the cross along and love is
[1:00:38] what changed the situation love is what
[1:00:40] cast out love is what cast out that
[1:00:42] devil when when that man came up to hit
[1:00:44] brother Branham in the face and and he
[1:00:46] fell across his feet why because love
[1:00:49] took over you oh love love is the
[1:00:52] greatest thing when a bull came to
[1:00:53] brother random and he spoke love he
[1:00:55] confronted me love not with not with a
[1:00:58] gun not with a revolver
[1:01:00] not with telling them how how little
[1:01:03] they were how how how how how much I
[1:01:06] disrespect you and all these kind of
[1:01:08] things but love love is the thing
[1:01:10] that'll win the day
[1:01:12] it's the life that's why in John he said
[1:01:16] that there was a rainbow around about
[1:01:17] the throne in sight like unto an emerald
[1:01:20] and brothers what does that Emerald
[1:01:22] represent this greenish what does green
[1:01:24] represent life life the life of God the
[1:01:28] life of God is on the throne of your
[1:01:30] heart the life of God is Tabernacle in
[1:01:33] Europe we could recognize that in
[1:01:34] ourself and our brothers things will be
[1:01:36] and our sisters things will be different
[1:01:39] laughs
[1:01:41] oh the picture the picture of that life
[1:01:43] the picture of that life that John was
[1:01:46] looking at is a Vindication of this
[1:01:47] message
[1:01:48] you just think now that that life that
[1:01:51] that light that John was looking at we
[1:01:53] can see there in the picture of uh over
[1:01:56] brother Brown that hangs on our walls
[1:01:58] and that same light is now dwelling in
[1:02:01] the heart of every believer
[1:02:03] to identify you with what John saw
[1:02:06] oh
[1:02:08] I got all these quotes I'm a
[1:02:10] let's see I'll skim through some of
[1:02:12] these
[1:02:13] he said and who do you say this is he
[1:02:15] said Lord we know it's you
[1:02:17] this Jesus Christ and the person of the
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost
[1:02:20] and we see the great Pillar of Fire
[1:02:22] Among Us Lord the same as they did in
[1:02:24] the first part of the Bible with Moses
[1:02:26] we've seen it in the middle of the Bible
[1:02:28] when Paul was on his road to Damascus we
[1:02:30] see it now here we see it at the end
[1:02:32] time again three is a confirmation it's
[1:02:34] been the message each time it's the same
[1:02:37] Lord Jesus made flesh in his people
[1:02:39] anointing his word for the bride and the
[1:02:42] message of Grace he said now Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ dwells in the people one day
[1:02:46] Christ was in a pillar of fire that one
[1:02:49] you see taken and we believe it to be
[1:02:50] Jehovah God that's what the angel was
[1:02:52] trying to get to us now he was in the
[1:02:54] fatherhood then he was the father of
[1:02:56] Israel a nation then he came and dwelt
[1:02:58] among his people as Christ the son
[1:03:00] Christ was the son of God now he's
[1:03:02] Christ the Holy Spirit which is the
[1:03:05] anointing Christ means the anointing and
[1:03:08] the anointed one upon the people Christ
[1:03:10] with us the holy spirit it's Christ with
[1:03:14] us in US you believe that it's it's the
[1:03:18] life in you the life in the church
[1:03:21] that's why Abel offered blood because it
[1:03:23] was life it was about life life was the
[1:03:25] ransom from death and Christ gave his
[1:03:27] blood to give his life
[1:03:30] and that's the attraction when the world
[1:03:32] sees the Life of Christ in you it
[1:03:35] attracts them to something they want to
[1:03:37] know more about it like like the burning
[1:03:38] bush that turned Moses aside
[1:03:41] now oh you think about this singing that
[1:03:44] John was looking at as we go through
[1:03:45] these this study the scene that John was
[1:03:48] looking at brother Brown identified it
[1:03:49] with the same thing that Ezekiel Saw
[1:03:52] back you there in Ezekiel chapter one
[1:03:54] when it says that Ezekiel looked
[1:03:56] he said I looked and behold a whirlwind
[1:03:59] came out of the North a great cloud and
[1:04:02] a fire and folding itself oh you think
[1:04:05] about this picture the fire like you
[1:04:07] look into a campfire and the fire just
[1:04:09] in full going into itself and rolling
[1:04:11] and boiling and fire and fooling itself
[1:04:13] and a brightness was about it and out of
[1:04:16] the midst thereof is the color of amber
[1:04:18] there's that same color that same color
[1:04:20] that was with that Pillar of Fire over
[1:04:21] brother Branham the same thing that
[1:04:23] John's looking at the same life that's
[1:04:26] in you is what Ezekiel was looking at is
[1:04:29] what John was looking at out of the
[1:04:31] midst thereof is the color of amber out
[1:04:33] of the midst of the fire also out of the
[1:04:35] midst thereof came the likeness of four
[1:04:38] living creatures
[1:04:40] and brother Ram said I want you to look
[1:04:42] at that just exactly what Ezekiel Saw
[1:04:45] same colors
[1:04:48] the same color
[1:04:50] the same way
[1:04:52] and acted the same way
[1:04:55] and flush the same way
[1:04:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:05:00] forever
[1:05:01] he's the same today as he was back there
[1:05:04] when Ezekiel Saw that light he acts the
[1:05:07] same way he behaves the same way because
[1:05:10] it's the same life he said what is it
[1:05:14] the living creatures represents the
[1:05:17] Living Church oh his life it's the Life
[1:05:20] of Christ and you and you're powered by
[1:05:23] what those four creatures represent
[1:05:26] he said the church that's living by the
[1:05:29] power and the resurrection of Christ
[1:05:31] that's what those living creatures
[1:05:33] represent them same Amber colors has
[1:05:36] covered it from the loins upward from
[1:05:38] the loins downward the same light that
[1:05:42] Ezekiel Saw is in you that same light
[1:05:44] that John saw is in you the same light
[1:05:47] that was with the prophet is in you he
[1:05:50] has ought to think about that tonight
[1:05:52] as we're as we're closing here in just a
[1:05:54] minute he has covered you he's covered
[1:05:57] you he's anointed you with his power he
[1:06:00] has filled you with his light with that
[1:06:02] same light that Ezekiel Saw he has
[1:06:05] filled you with his life
[1:06:07] and he did it why did he do it because
[1:06:10] he promised he would do it
[1:06:13] in Revelation 4 3 it says he see that
[1:06:15] was was to look upon as a Jasper and a
[1:06:17] sergeant Stone and it was a rainbow
[1:06:19] round about the throne in sight like
[1:06:22] unto an emerald brother said that round
[1:06:24] about that Circle means that he promised
[1:06:27] he would do it it means he said the
[1:06:31] reason he was surrounded with that
[1:06:33] Circle Bowl of green amber color that
[1:06:36] life was because he said he is a
[1:06:39] covenant-keeping God he will keep his
[1:06:43] Covenant he he promised he would give
[1:06:45] you that life
[1:06:46] he promised he would give it to you
[1:06:49] I'll be closing here in just a moment
[1:06:51] yeah it makes me nervous as the clock
[1:06:53] ticks around and I know people are
[1:06:54] getting tired
[1:06:58] in Genesis 9
[1:07:00] when God gave that promise to Noah it
[1:07:03] says and it shall come to pass when I
[1:07:05] bring a cloud over the Earth that the
[1:07:06] bow shall be seen in the cloud and I'll
[1:07:09] remember my Covenant which is between me
[1:07:11] and you and every living creature of All
[1:07:13] Flesh and the water shall no more become
[1:07:15] a flood to destroy all flesh now brother
[1:07:17] said the Covenant was life for Noah that
[1:07:19] he spared him he kept Noah alive the
[1:07:21] Covenant was a lie for Noah but the
[1:07:24] Covenant that God made with himself was
[1:07:27] a rainbow
[1:07:28] and that's what John was looking at a
[1:07:30] rainbow round about The Throne an
[1:07:32] emerald in color and he said a covenant
[1:07:35] then is a token a token of what now
[1:07:38] brother said you go back to the previous
[1:07:40] chapter in Genesis 8 and Noah built an
[1:07:43] altar with the Lord and He sacrificed he
[1:07:46] made a sacrifice and God he said the
[1:07:48] Lord smelled a sweet Savor and the Lord
[1:07:51] said in his heart I will not again curse
[1:07:53] the ground so so God put that bow in the
[1:07:56] sky as a token that I've accepted the
[1:07:59] sacrifice now see that token that that
[1:08:02] that bow that John's looking at is a
[1:08:05] symbol that God has accepted the
[1:08:07] sacrifice that was made for you oh you
[1:08:10] see what a great picture this is that
[1:08:12] this picture when these this story this
[1:08:14] picture becomes begins to unfold to us
[1:08:16] it gives us confidence and who we are
[1:08:19] that the life that that the life of God
[1:08:23] has made manifest in US
[1:08:25] what does it mean brother Brown said
[1:08:27] that God has promised
[1:08:29] God promised he said he also takes his
[1:08:32] oath and swears by himself that's what
[1:08:34] Paul was talking about in Hebrews 6 that
[1:08:36] God confirmed it by an oath that by two
[1:08:38] immutable things in which it was
[1:08:40] impossible for God to lie we might have
[1:08:42] a strong consolation and When God Says
[1:08:45] something you know God he's going to
[1:08:47] back up his word
[1:08:49] you can you can just hang everything on
[1:08:51] on every promise of God he said God and
[1:08:54] His seven colored rainbow his Covenant
[1:08:56] that he made a covenant through seven
[1:08:59] Church ages the seven Church colors that
[1:09:02] he would save the Earth
[1:09:05] he promised he would do it let's stop
[1:09:08] there the musicians can go ahead and
[1:09:09] come forward he promised he would do it
[1:09:11] he has proven his promise in you the
[1:09:14] very light and the power of God is
[1:09:16] reflected in this church
[1:09:18] that proves that he keeps his promise
[1:09:22] the very light and power that's in you
[1:09:25] is proven that he keeps his promise oh
[1:09:27] doesn't that just make you feel good as
[1:09:29] we stand to our feet that the life that
[1:09:31] you're living proves that he keeps his
[1:09:33] promise
[1:09:34] as you walk amongst your co-workers at
[1:09:36] work and with you with your maybe you've
[1:09:37] got unbelieving family members the life
[1:09:40] that you live proves that God keeps his
[1:09:42] promise we've got a covenant keeping God
