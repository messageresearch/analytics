[3:20] over the past weekend uh we we really
[3:23] had a good time and uh I didn't I didn't
[3:26] uh Minister down there but I was there
[3:28] in helping interpret
[3:30] um for the brother that uh Lord willing
[3:33] will have this Sunday Lord willing
[3:35] brother Dell uh brother
[3:37] Fabian um Palma now uh just real quick
[3:41] brother faan he is considered if you all
[3:44] know the La Fontaine family who's
[3:46] written many songs in the message that
[3:48] we still sing and we sing from here from
[3:50] the pulpit um he is considered like the
[3:53] La Fontaine the equivalent of the La
[3:55] Fontaine for Central and South America
[3:57] and Spain many Spanish speaking
[4:00] he uh he goes to he's also an evangelist
[4:04] and he goes to the church where brother
[4:05] ner is from if you remember brother ner
[4:07] and his family that came here a few
[4:09] months ago uh that's the church where
[4:11] they're at so brother ner has some
[4:14] things that he left behind before they
[4:16] left and they've been sitting in my
[4:18] basement for all these
[4:20] months so they had they were planning on
[4:22] a trip to go to London because brother
[4:24] Fabian was going to minister there in
[4:26] London England back in March or April of
[4:29] this year but when all this pandemic hit
[4:32] and everything all that was cancelled so
[4:34] the airlines told them that they could
[4:36] use those those flight those tickets for
[4:38] a later flight so then they decided to
[4:40] come this way and uh they started there
[4:43] in Jacksonville and brother ner followed
[4:45] along with him so hopefully he might be
[4:47] taking some of those things back with
[4:49] him this on this trip he can't take it
[4:52] all he said I'll just take what I can
[4:53] and the rest of it just give it to
[4:55] Goodwill but it'll be good to he was
[4:58] there this past week so it was really
[5:00] good to see him and he'll be here with
[5:02] us on Sunday Lord willing so you
[5:04] remember uh those uh those the meeting
[5:07] and uh remember those Brothers in prayer
[5:10] praise the Lord Jesus you love the Lord
[5:12] tonight amen amen amen so let's just go
[5:15] to the word this this evening uh we want
[5:17] to turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 1
[5:21] Corinthians chapter 15 starting at verse
[5:27] 50 I'm just going to read it from from
[5:29] here I didn't have
[5:32] it 1 Corinthians 15: 50 I want to just
[5:36] do a little maybe like a little Sunday
[5:38] school lesson we haven't had Sunday
[5:40] School in a while so maybe we'll just do
[5:43] like a little Sunday school lesson and
[5:45] uh it's just something that I've been
[5:47] thinking about lately and I think that
[5:48] every Christian in this hour I think if
[5:51] they really have Christ in their heart
[5:52] this is something that should be
[5:53] motivating them at this very moment
[5:56] uh the the change of our bodies
[6:00] and the resurrection that we are looking
[6:02] forward to to seeing uh I I don't I
[6:05] don't I don't have any hopes for
[6:06] anything else in this hour but
[6:09] that you know the world fails you the
[6:12] the the politics fail you I mean this
[6:14] world is corrupt this country is is
[6:16] definitely corrupt and and uh and you
[6:19] can you can only and I believe God is
[6:22] allowing that so that we can start
[6:23] depending more on this word and start
[6:26] and start and start seeing that we can't
[6:28] depend on the on on the politics of this
[6:30] world we can't depend on any man we
[6:33] can't depend on any any movement any
[6:35] party we can only depend on God because
[6:38] God's the only one that cannot fail his
[6:39] word never failed they will never fail
[6:42] and so uh so we're just looking at this
[6:45] here and I want to talk about death
[6:46] where is thy sting grave where is thy
[6:48] Victory so we read in 1 Corinthians
[6:50] chapter 15 Paul says in verse 50 let me
[6:55] turn there myself
[7:00] he says now this I say Brethren that
[7:03] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[7:05] kingdom of God neither does corruption
[7:08] inherit
[7:10] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[7:13] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[7:16] be changed what a
[7:19] promise in a moment in the twinkling of
[7:22] an eye at the last Trump in other words
[7:25] at the last trumpet for the trumpet
[7:27] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[7:31] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[7:34] you see how Paul in each one of these
[7:35] verses he is saying it will be it shall
[7:38] be it's all positive it's there's no
[7:40] doubt about
[7:41] it for this corruptible must put on
[7:45] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[7:49] immortality so when this corruptible
[7:51] shall have put on incorruption and this
[7:54] Mortal shall have put on
[7:56] immortality then shall be brought to
[7:59] pass the saying that it is written death
[8:03] is swallowed up in Victory oh death
[8:06] where is thy sting oh grave where is thy
[8:08] Victory and that's where I got the title
[8:10] for this little message The Sting of
[8:13] death is sin and the strength of sin is
[8:16] the law but thanks be to God which
[8:19] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[8:21] Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[8:23] Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable
[8:26] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[8:28] for as much as you know that your labor
[8:30] is not in vain in the Lord amen let's
[8:33] just bow our heads our gracious Lord
[8:36] Jesus we thank you Father God as we open
[8:38] back the pages of your word this very
[8:40] moment Lord we would ask you father God
[8:42] that you would just reveal this portion
[8:44] to our hearts Lord many times we've
[8:46] probably read many times through over
[8:49] these same verses throughout our years
[8:51] of Christianity but never stopped and
[8:54] pay attention and maybe delved a little
[8:57] deep in these scriptures and so Lord
[8:59] help us father God as we Endeavor to do
[9:01] that at this moment and we pray that you
[9:03] would just Reveal Your word unto us Lord
[9:05] make it so real to us father God that it
[9:08] was just drown out everything else
[9:10] around us father God and all and just
[9:12] only Look to You Lord God grant it
[9:15] father God we pray that you'd heal every
[9:17] sick one amongst us father meet every
[9:19] need Lord that's in our midst father God
[9:21] for we're certainly needy people but you
[9:23] are the one father God that can supply
[9:25] all of our needs according to your
[9:27] riches and Glory we love you we commit
[9:29] ourselves into your hands bless those
[9:31] that are traveling brother Wade if he's
[9:32] out right now traveling keep him safe
[9:35] father God and bless him and we just
[9:37] Commit This Time into your hands now in
[9:39] Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless
[9:41] you Saints you may be
[9:46] seated thank thank brother Dell for
[9:48] giving us the
[9:49] opportunity to uh letting us borrow the
[9:53] pulpit
[9:54] again amen appreciate appreciate the
[9:57] Lord amen so
[10:00] death where is thy sting grave where is
[10:02] thy Victory amen what two questions that
[10:05] Paul asks here and uh uh and it's it's
[10:10] um it's a Sur I mean it's not that he
[10:12] knew he knew where where where those
[10:14] things were at I mean he knew the answer
[10:16] for them uh because he had experienced
[10:18] it himself in his life amen and you know
[10:21] we live in a culture nowadays where is
[10:24] it's it's full of death you know it's
[10:26] death all around us and it seems like
[10:28] everybody is is just it's in love with
[10:31] the culture of death uh you see it in
[10:34] the way they live and the way they talk
[10:36] and the way they dress and the way they
[10:38] they they they carry themselves it's a
[10:40] culture of death all around us amen and
[10:43] it's and remember that death has to be
[10:46] on the scene uh in order for the light
[10:48] to
[10:49] shine for the light to be able to uh
[10:53] it's it's it's a thing of of U uh if
[10:56] there's no Darkness there can't the
[10:58] light can't can't shine amen so we live
[11:01] in that type of uh situation in this
[11:03] hour and the thing is getting darker and
[11:05] darker and dark darker by the minute
[11:07] Saints um but the bride amen is getting
[11:10] brighter and brighter and brighter and
[11:12] it should she should be she should be
[11:14] getting brighter it should be getting
[11:16] lighter and lighter by the hour amen
[11:18] because every day that goes forth amen
[11:21] we should be letting go of all the
[11:23] weights and the sins that do so easily
[11:26] beset us as the word says amen you
[11:28] shouldn't be piling on more sin on your
[11:31] life and think that you're going to get
[11:32] the glory and think that you're going in
[11:34] a Rapture think that you're going to get
[11:35] a body change it doesn't work that way
[11:37] you need to be getting lighter and
[11:39] lighter and lighter as the days go by
[11:41] especially as we see that the days that
[11:44] that that that that are on us you know
[11:47] reading in Matthew 24 do you realize
[11:49] that within the past month or two a lot
[11:51] of things that Matthew 24 says have come
[11:54] to pass right I'm just in the past month
[11:57] or two we've had earthquakes we've had
[12:00] we've had wars and rumors of wars oh
[12:03] yeah right now China is on a verge of
[12:05] having a war with Taiwan going in there
[12:08] and invading it uh and there's Wars
[12:12] taking place in uh uh near Syria and and
[12:15] and and and conflicts and uh uh you have
[12:19] um I see there's Wars rumors of wars
[12:22] there's a pestilences of course we see
[12:24] the pestilence amongst us uh uh you know
[12:29] and so you know what what is left amen
[12:33] what is left for us to to to to to to
[12:36] experience I mean we see Matthew 24 just
[12:38] taking place now we've seen it
[12:39] throughout the years we've seen it
[12:41] throughout throughout the ages but I
[12:43] mean this is definitely it's like it's
[12:45] like it's gone on the increase amen it's
[12:47] like it's like the volume amen or the
[12:49] knob has been turned Amen to to a higher
[12:52] level you see and it's getting hotter
[12:55] and harder and hotter amen but the but
[12:57] you and I Saints amen we see these
[12:59] things and they should be signs to us
[13:02] amen for us to get in the place where we
[13:05] need to be Amen to look at the sign and
[13:09] see okay that's not not to just see the
[13:12] signs and be so involved and so in love
[13:15] with the signs but be in love with what
[13:17] the sign is pointing to amen which is
[13:20] Christ amen the and his coming praise
[13:22] God Amen so in 1 Corinthians chapter 15
[13:25] here in the verse verse and we'll just
[13:27] kind of take it down verse by verse
[13:29] verse but Paul says here in the first in
[13:31] verse 50 now this I say Brethren that
[13:34] flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[13:37] kingdom of God
[13:39] Amen neither does corruption inherit
[13:43] incorruption now we know that Paul says
[13:45] in in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:14 that
[13:48] the natural man cannot even understand
[13:51] the things of God you when you were born
[13:54] in this world you had no desire to serve
[13:57] God you don't need even understand about
[14:00] God that's how each and every one of us
[14:03] was right that's that is that is that is
[14:07] what we we didn't we we again we always
[14:10] say this and it's the truth we were
[14:12] never looking for God but God was always
[14:14] looking for us amen it's not that he
[14:17] didn't know where we were he knew where
[14:18] we were cuz he knew where Adam was when
[14:20] even though he was saying Adam Where Art
[14:22] Thou but he we know that he wanted Adam
[14:25] to know where in in what spot where he
[14:28] he was in at the moment but Paul says in
[14:30] 1 Corinthians chap 2:14 but the natural
[14:33] man receiveth not the things of the
[14:35] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[14:38] unto him that's why when you talk to
[14:40] someone about God and or or or for the
[14:43] first time they think it's strange they
[14:45] think it's it's it's it's weird they
[14:47] think what why do I need to get born
[14:49] again what does that have to do with me
[14:52] I've never stolen I've never killed
[14:54] anybody I've never cheated I've never
[14:56] done this that or the other but they
[14:58] don't understand that they've come with
[14:59] a nature you can be as good as you as
[15:02] you but you come with a sinful nature
[15:04] that you are prone to any one of those
[15:07] things since God is not in in your soul
[15:10] amen and that is what Paul is talking
[15:12] about here that flesh and blood cannot
[15:15] inherit the kingdom of God Amen and the
[15:18] blood is the life of the of this animal
[15:20] flesh that we have amen that we walk in
[15:23] that we we we live by the by the by
[15:26] flowing blood that we have in US amen
[15:29] but the bride of Christ the the
[15:31] Christian lives by the holy spirit in
[15:34] their soul amen God's holy spirit in
[15:36] their soul that's how the soul lives
[15:38] amen so the the spirit of God is is the
[15:42] life of the Soul amen that's that's in
[15:44] us and and that is why Jesus said in in
[15:48] in John 3:6 that that which is born of
[15:51] the flesh is flesh and that which is
[15:56] born of the spirit is Spirit
[15:59] Amen in other words when you when you're
[16:02] not a Christian you're not a Christian
[16:04] exactly amen when you're but when you're
[16:06] a Christian you should be a real
[16:08] Christian amen there's no in between
[16:11] that which is of the flesh is of the
[16:13] flesh that is what of the spirit is of
[16:16] the spirit amen God doesn't accept
[16:18] anything in between and there's no inet
[16:20] you're either hot or you're either cold
[16:22] amen but you can't be in between you
[16:24] can't be one foot in church and one foot
[16:26] out in the world you've got to be in on
[16:28] on fire for God or you've just got to be
[16:30] out in the world period amen serving the
[16:32] world serving this world order doing the
[16:35] things of the world Amen praise God Amen
[16:39] so that's what Jesus told us amen so
[16:41] Paul there is telling us amen that flesh
[16:44] and blood cannot just automatically
[16:48] transition into into a change right
[16:51] without there being a change first in
[16:53] your soul right you see what I'm saying
[16:56] let me say that again you your body body
[16:59] cannot transition into a body change
[17:02] without first there being a change
[17:04] inside of you in other words a touch of
[17:06] the Eternal within you that's right Amen
[17:10] in other words the kingdom of God must
[17:13] be in you first Glory before you can
[17:16] possess this Kingdom amen this Earth You
[17:20] see it's got to be in you first so that
[17:23] that's what Paul's saying there in in
[17:24] verse 50 neither do corruption inherit
[17:28] incorruption
[17:29] you can't say you got you're going to go
[17:30] to heaven in your in your natural way in
[17:33] your natural man and you know we all
[17:35] know these things but the world is so
[17:37] fooled in this hour that they think that
[17:39] if they just go to church that that's
[17:41] all they need oh yeah that if they just
[17:43] shook the pastor's hand or if they did
[17:46] something you know some good work and
[17:48] they give uh uh to Goodwill every single
[17:51] week or something like that that that
[17:53] that that'll just get them right on
[17:55] right in and it and it doesn't it has to
[17:58] be an experience with Christ it has to
[18:00] be something amen that is real to you
[18:03] amen that you know that you've been born
[18:05] again praise God verse 51 behold I show
[18:08] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[18:12] we shall all be changed amen praise God
[18:17] now in um in the previous verse there
[18:20] Paul was talking for himself because he
[18:23] says now this I say but but now here is
[18:27] a here's a mystery
[18:29] introduced amen and uh you know when
[18:33] when we were just now talking about
[18:35] Matthew 24 Jesus talking to his
[18:37] disciples about the things that was come
[18:39] coming to pass we know that those had
[18:41] dual meanings there were some things
[18:43] that were going to take place in in
[18:44] Israel and they happened in ad70 but
[18:47] then you bring them down to this hour as
[18:49] well and to this our day but when Jesus
[18:51] was telling them these things they had
[18:54] no idea what Jesus was talking about
[18:56] there was a mystery to them it was a
[18:59] mystery to them and and it was a a
[19:02] mysterious thing to the disciples but
[19:04] now Paul here is in this case he's
[19:07] introducing to us another layer of these
[19:11] Mysteries amen praise God because he
[19:14] says behold I show you a mystery now if
[19:17] it was a mystery amen it had to been
[19:20] revealed to him somewhere or another
[19:23] praise God because he was looking
[19:24] forward to it he he he believed it so
[19:27] much and he he he wrote about it and
[19:30] believed it so much he thought it would
[19:31] happen in his day amen but we know that
[19:36] that's for us amen we know that we're
[19:38] the ones to carry out this and you
[19:40] should be happy and and and glad in this
[19:42] hour that God has had has so much
[19:45] confidence in you to put you in this in
[19:48] this generation in this in this day that
[19:51] we're living in Amen in order to fulfill
[19:53] this
[19:54] scripture can you imagine that in order
[19:58] for you to fulfill the scripture God
[20:00] couldn't have put the confidence on
[20:02] anybody else right God placed confidence
[20:05] in you and I who you and I with the Holy
[20:08] Spirit and we're the the recipients and
[20:11] the possible ones to to to uh to fulfill
[20:15] this word in this hour what a great
[20:17] thing Amen to think about Sir that we we
[20:21] I mean I don't think this thing can go
[20:22] on any further I mean much longer much
[20:25] longer I mean so why are we Dilly
[20:29] dallying around and playing
[20:33] games why are we not why are we uh
[20:36] holding off you know uh talking to that
[20:38] brother or that sister that you know you
[20:40] need to ask forgiveness for for
[20:42] something that happened several years
[20:44] ago and it's still bothering
[20:46] you you know you need to make that right
[20:48] so go ahead and make it right why are
[20:51] you why are you just you know delaying
[20:53] that's you playing games and that's you
[20:55] not taking the word seriously oh I'm
[20:57] coming down home now a little bit but do
[21:00] you realize that these are the things
[21:02] that that the the world events that are
[21:04] taking place the signs that are taking
[21:05] place are making us look at ourselves in
[21:08] our lives and seeing wait a second this
[21:10] is really an individual walk between me
[21:12] and Christ right I'm not going on mom on
[21:15] mom on what Mom believes or on what my
[21:17] dad believes or on what brother Dale
[21:19] believes I'm going on with what I what
[21:21] God has showed me amen and is it
[21:23] revealed to
[21:25] me and then I'm going to act upon it
[21:27] amen
[21:29] this thing's about over Saints praise
[21:31] God right amen so here Paul is
[21:34] introducing to us a mystery that can
[21:36] only come out of the mystery and who is
[21:39] the mystery amen what is Christ is
[21:41] Christ The Mystery of God revealed in US
[21:43] amen praise God Colossians 1:27 says to
[21:47] whom God would make known what is the
[21:50] riches of the glory of this mystery
[21:54] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[21:57] you the hope of glor GL it's something
[21:59] that the world has no idea that's
[22:01] happening right now in this hour
[22:04] everybody's so fixated on what's going
[22:06] on that they don't realize that God has
[22:08] a people Amen in this hour that are
[22:10] going to be translated and and that and
[22:13] that have God themselves in their souls
[22:16] amen sir God right now standing on this
[22:19] earth and the people don't realize it in
[22:21] this hour that's right in you and I in
[22:24] this hour praise God amen amen God would
[22:29] make known what is the riches of Glory
[22:31] of this mystery among the Gentiles which
[22:33] is Christ in you the hope of glory
[22:36] amen now in order for you for you to be
[22:39] able to come to this you have to have
[22:41] Christ in you the hope of glory amen it
[22:43] because Paul continue saying we shall
[22:45] not all sleep in other words we shall
[22:47] not all physically die
[22:51] amen that's kind of it's a strange thing
[22:54] because we're so used to seeing somebody
[22:56] born and then live living and then dying
[22:59] somebody born living and dying it's it's
[23:01] a it's a routine that we have seen
[23:04] throughout all of our lives but there
[23:05] will come a point in time where
[23:07] somebody's going to stop death at its
[23:09] tracks amen somebody's gonna brother
[23:12] Bram said that it's going to start
[23:13] crawling up on you and then you're just
[23:15] going to shr it up because you're so
[23:16] you're so you're so concentrated on the
[23:19] word on what he said and on that life
[23:21] amen that death won't even have anything
[23:23] on you amen praise God hallelujah and we
[23:26] need to start practicing it amen I'm not
[23:29] worrying about what's going on right now
[23:31] out here amen not worrying about what
[23:33] the news says not worrying about what
[23:35] the media says not worrying about what
[23:36] this person says or that person says or
[23:38] what believe the sign says or this that
[23:40] or the other amen when you look at the
[23:42] word and the word only amen it'll bring
[23:44] you to a point where you're going to be
[23:46] able to say death I'm not even paying
[23:47] attention to you you're so concentrated
[23:50] on God you're so concentrated on the
[23:52] word amen and that word amen is so in
[23:55] you that it's going to cause you Amen to
[23:57] step into that body change Amen to step
[24:00] into the next phase that we're that that
[24:03] that that is upon us which is a
[24:06] resurrection and Paul talks about it
[24:08] here amen and then the next part of that
[24:11] verse he says but we shall all be
[24:14] changed in other words we all will come
[24:17] to this body change
[24:19] right what a promise amen amen I mean
[24:23] that makes me that makes me feel I mean
[24:25] everything else just Fades away amen
[24:27] everything else the music of the world
[24:29] the the video games of the world the the
[24:31] sports of the world everything just
[24:33] Fades away amen when when we think about
[24:35] amen that there's there's a hope amen
[24:38] outside of this outside of this current
[24:40] world uh Cosmos that we're living in
[24:42] amen righten Christ never failed you I
[24:46] like something that was said this this
[24:48] this weekend about and about the from
[24:50] the brother that that this Lord willing
[24:52] be going to speak for us this Sunday but
[24:55] he said you know did Christ keep you
[24:57] yesterday
[25:00] yes is Christ keeping you
[25:03] now amen so that means Christ will keep
[25:06] you tomorrow right amen praise God and
[25:09] that that's that's a hope because you
[25:11] know Saints sometimes we we we we take a
[25:14] look at the things of these of this life
[25:16] and we feed off the the the the media of
[25:19] the world and the news of the world and
[25:21] it really start bubbling up fear in you
[25:25] without you even wanting it it's a
[25:27] tactic of the devil devil and he uses
[25:29] the media to do so amen and and and and
[25:33] you're not really sinning it's not like
[25:35] you're watching an rated movie or some
[25:38] some bad movie or something that you're
[25:40] not you're just watching the news right
[25:43] you're just looking at the news you're
[25:44] looking at the numbers of covid you know
[25:46] just going up and your eyes are getting
[25:49] bigger and bigger and your mouth is
[25:51] getting wider and wider and you know
[25:54] what H what's happening you're stepping
[25:56] away from the word of God yeah because
[25:59] now instead of you looking to Christ
[26:02] amen the author and finisher of our
[26:04] faith you're looking at covid numbers
[26:06] and that seems to be more real to you
[26:08] than the word of God and what happens is
[26:11] you're going to start acting upon it
[26:12] you're going to start living your life
[26:14] in fear knowing leaving aside the word
[26:18] of God right isn't that what happens see
[26:21] Satan Sly he don't need to he don't need
[26:23] to bring in there for you to listen to
[26:25] some worldly music or some x-rated movie
[26:27] or anything like that just shows you the
[26:29] news right exactly right well I don't
[26:32] know how I got into that
[26:34] but praise
[26:36] God but it's the truth I know because
[26:39] it's happened to me it's happened to me
[26:42] verse 52 now Paul continues saying here
[26:45] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[26:49] at the last Trump for the trump it shall
[26:52] sound and the dead shall be raised
[26:55] Incorruptible and we shall all be
[26:57] changed amen now we see here that in a
[27:00] moment in the twinkling of an eye we
[27:03] will be changed amen that change takes
[27:06] place in a Flash or in a blink of an eye
[27:09] right can you imagine that that the
[27:12] Rapture amen that your body change that
[27:14] you are looking forward to so much espec
[27:17] if you're a Christian that's the only
[27:18] thing that you're really Desiring amen
[27:21] is a is a body change it it should be
[27:23] the the the hope and the and and the and
[27:26] the thing that you're looking for to
[27:28] especially you older
[27:31] ones it's something it's a promise that
[27:33] that that that the scripture says but
[27:35] it's something that's going to take
[27:37] place in a moment in a twinkling of an
[27:39] eye I want to see everybody blinking
[27:42] their eyes right
[27:44] now sister jul I just saw you blinking
[27:46] your
[27:49] ey it just it's it's something quick
[27:51] right something quick that's how quick
[27:55] that body change is going to be exactly
[27:57] and it's not just going to be a portion
[27:58] not not not just blinking your eye and
[28:01] and and only your your hands will be
[28:03] will be will be changed no your whole
[28:05] body will be changed amen your whole
[28:10] body I was looking at something here
[28:12] about 5G have you heard of 5G the 5G is
[28:16] coming on the scene now um and it's the
[28:19] next step is the next connection uh
[28:22] after what we have now is 4G and LTE on
[28:26] on on mobile care carriers uh uh cell
[28:29] phones and the next connection step or
[28:33] the next connection phase is 5G now let
[28:39] just listen to this how 5G is so
[28:42] significantly
[28:43] faster 5G delivers up to 20 gigabits per
[28:49] second amen per uh Peak data rates and
[28:52] 100 megabits per second average data
[28:55] rates now here's an example of what that
[28:57] means
[28:59] just how fast is 20 gigabits really it
[29:02] can be demonstrated by a simple example
[29:05] a user takes around 13 minutes to
[29:07] download the content of a DVD now you
[29:10] have a DVD we all probably have them at
[29:14] home and they can you can extract the
[29:17] contents of that DVD and it'll probably
[29:19] be about maybe five gigs five gigabytes
[29:22] worth of data from that DVD to put it
[29:25] online so if you wanted at this current
[29:27] moment if you wanted to download that
[29:29] those 5 gigabytes amen it would take you
[29:32] 13 minutes to download those five those
[29:35] 5 gigabytes if you had a uh a connection
[29:40] like a DSL connection with only with a
[29:43] bandwidth of only 50 megabits per second
[29:46] that's kind of you know it's kind of uh
[29:49] kind of average right now the
[29:51] connections right now at internet at
[29:53] home amen but now watch what a 5G
[29:56] enabled smartphone can do or a laptop it
[29:59] could download that same content of an
[30:02] entire DVD on Mobile 5G data link in
[30:05] just two seconds in the best case
[30:10] scenario I me from 13 minutes to two
[30:13] seconds that's that's pretty that's
[30:14] pretty good that's pretty fast you that
[30:17] you can download a whole movie let's
[30:20] just say benur or the Ten
[30:23] Commandments download it in about two
[30:26] seconds have it on your phone ready
[30:28] ready to watch that's pretty fast but do
[30:32] you realize that the body changes much
[30:36] faster your the body changes faster than
[30:39] two seconds right body changes faster
[30:42] than than than
[30:43] 5G body changes faster than anything
[30:46] else that man will ever come out with if
[30:48] we're here longer amen it's going to
[30:51] happen much quicker than that amen this
[30:53] change that Paul is talking about is
[30:55] much faster than this 5G
[30:58] amen praise
[31:00] God much
[31:03] faster cuz two seconds it doesn't take
[31:05] you two seconds to Blink unless you have
[31:08] problems with your
[31:10] [Laughter]
[31:11] eyes you
[31:15] know I me we we blink I mean that's less
[31:18] probably some of less than a second you
[31:21] see and Paul says here in a moment in a
[31:24] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[31:27] amen amen now this Trump amen this
[31:30] trumpet amen uh let's look here 1
[31:32] Thessalonians chap 4:1 16 for the Lord
[31:36] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[31:38] shout with the voice of the
[31:41] Archangel and with the Trump of God now
[31:44] brother Brandon made this clear in the
[31:45] message the Rapture of what these three
[31:48] things are right amen and and if the
[31:50] brothers could pull up this quote
[31:52] brother Bram says here it's a real short
[31:54] quote but he makes it very concise and I
[31:56] added some things parenthesis just to
[31:58] kind of show you uh what brother Brandon
[32:01] was talking about there the first thing
[32:03] comes forth is his message which is the
[32:05] shout amen calling the bride together
[32:10] the next thing is a resurrection of the
[32:12] sleeping bride that's the voice of the
[32:14] son of man amen amen that's the voice
[32:16] that Paul's talking about there in 1
[32:18] Thessalonians 4:16 with a shout with the
[32:21] voice of the Archangel amen and do you
[32:23] realize that that voice is in you and I
[32:25] this house exactly amen The Voice of the
[32:28] son of man is in you tonight amen you
[32:31] and I are going to be part of calling of
[32:34] of of of of bringing those resurrected
[32:36] Saints amen not that we're going to be
[32:38] out there in the graves or calling them
[32:40] out or anything like that but there's
[32:41] going to be such a pull
[32:43] amen because we're so connected to the
[32:46] word and the word amen the son of man
[32:48] Ministry in us that called amen Lazarus
[32:51] from the grave that did all those things
[32:53] when the son of man uh was was here on
[32:55] Earth Jesus Christ amen and a
[32:57] Resurrection took place amen that same
[33:00] son of man is in Us in this hour praise
[33:02] God that same Jesus Christ amen that
[33:05] voice is in the Bride As I was as I was
[33:07] reading those quotes last time I was
[33:09] ministering here the voice now is in the
[33:11] bride glory amen exactly do you believe
[33:16] that I I believe that with all my heart
[33:20] Amen to you as a born again what Born
[33:23] Again believer amen that voice is in you
[33:25] and I in this hour and you're going to
[33:27] be part part of that magnetism amen that
[33:30] will bring amen this the the dead from
[33:33] from the from from the ground amen that
[33:35] Resurrection
[33:37] amen the voice of the son of man now
[33:40] then brother Brown continues saying here
[33:41] the ones died back in the other ages
[33:43] they're caught together and the trumpet
[33:46] the feast in the heavens in the sky
[33:49] that's the Rapture or the catching away
[33:50] of the Bride why that's the thing that
[33:53] takes place friends so that is the that
[33:56] is what the Trump of God is
[33:58] it's that calling away amen it's that
[34:01] Rapture amen praise God is that meeting
[34:04] in the air is that is that meeting in
[34:07] for for the marriage supper of the of of
[34:09] the lamb and the bride amen praise God
[34:13] the trumpet is very important amen
[34:16] praise God Amen so that is what Paul is
[34:18] bringing out there in this verse verse
[34:20] 52 and we go back to it in a moment in
[34:23] the twinkling of an ey at the last Trump
[34:25] amen
[34:27] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[34:30] sound and the dead shall be raised now
[34:33] watch what he says here and the dead
[34:34] shall be raised
[34:37] Incorruptible not that it they they
[34:39] might
[34:40] raise there's a possibility there's a
[34:43] there's a 50% chance that they might
[34:45] rais no the dead shall be raised shall I
[34:49] mean Paul was certain Paul was certain
[34:52] can you imagine that and how much more
[34:53] certain we would be in this hour when we
[34:55] have the complete open word in this
[34:58] we should be even more certain about
[35:00] that and more preoccupied in it than we
[35:03] should be about covid numbers and stuff
[35:05] like that
[35:09] amen that we shall be raised
[35:12] Incorruptible and we shall all be
[35:14] changed right amen that makes me happy
[35:18] amen I don't know about you man that
[35:21] that that just does something to
[35:26] me you know it it just it it uh it just
[35:29] Fades everything else out right it makes
[35:32] me want to go home and see what else can
[35:34] I get rid of Amen that I need to get rid
[35:36] of Amen it makes me want to go look
[35:39] through my phone list and see who else I
[35:41] need to call to make things right with
[35:42] someone or or do something you see and
[35:46] it should do the same thing for you
[35:48] praise
[35:50] God verse 53 says for this corruptible
[35:55] must Paul's speaking here again must put
[35:58] on incorruption right and this Mortal
[36:02] must put on immortality
[36:05] amen and and it would seem like this
[36:09] verse right here uh contradicts the
[36:11] first verse that Paul was speaking or
[36:13] the ver verse 50 because in that verse
[36:16] 50 Paul was saying that flesh and blood
[36:19] cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[36:21] neither do corruption inherit
[36:24] incorruption but Paul's here in verse 53
[36:26] he's saying this corruptible must put on
[36:29] incorruption right and this Mortal must
[36:32] put on immortality amen but see you have
[36:35] to realize that in in verse 50 Paul was
[36:38] speaking about the natural man the
[36:41] unregenerated man the unconverted man
[36:44] cannot inherit right the kingdom of God
[36:47] Amen you see the the natural man in this
[36:50] earth cannot step into a body change
[36:52] that body change only belongs to the
[36:54] bride of Christ right because she's got
[36:56] God in her soul
[36:58] you see but what Paul is talking about
[37:00] here in verse 53 he's speaking of the
[37:03] Bride amen who already has the the Holy
[37:05] Ghost in their soul in other words the
[37:07] new birth praise
[37:09] God so it we must come to that point
[37:14] amen and we are coming to that point I
[37:16] believe amen I believe Saints we are
[37:19] coming to that point
[37:21] amen praise God so the there there's
[37:25] there's no way to to to stop this from
[37:28] coming amen when you've when you've got
[37:30] Christ in your heart and you're and
[37:32] you're growing on a daily basis you're
[37:34] growing in that stature amen you're
[37:36] growing in you're growing in that life
[37:39] amen you're coming to that head amen
[37:41] there's no way for you to to to not come
[37:43] to that to that body change right amen
[37:46] you've got to come every because that
[37:48] you're part of his body right you're
[37:50] part of his life amen and you've got to
[37:53] come to this 2 Corinthians 5:4 tells us
[37:56] for we who are in this tent in other
[37:59] words in this body in this tent we groan
[38:02] being burdened not because we want to be
[38:05] unclothed but further clothed that
[38:08] mortality may be swallowed up by life
[38:11] amen I like the way the New Living
[38:13] Translation says it and we I believe I
[38:16] put it here the brothers can put it on
[38:17] there it says while we live in these
[38:19] Earthly bodies we Gran and sigh but it's
[38:22] not that we want to die and get rid of
[38:24] these bodies that clothe us rather we
[38:26] want to put on our new bodies so that
[38:29] these dying bodies will be swallowed up
[38:31] by life amen right now we know it's not
[38:34] a new body your body the one that you
[38:37] currently have amen if you're here for
[38:39] that change amen that's what's going to
[38:41] be transformed it's not that God has
[38:43] another body there for you waiting no
[38:45] it's this body made new praise God Amen
[38:48] because this is what you know this is
[38:50] what God gave you this is your
[38:52] possession amen and this is what God is
[38:55] wanting to restore amen because because
[38:57] this was in his mind amen this is what
[39:00] he gave he gave you was part of him as
[39:02] well amen you have a connection to this
[39:06] Earth with this body another body
[39:09] somewhere else or anything like that has
[39:11] no connection to this earth and we you
[39:13] and I are to live in this earth amen
[39:16] throughout all eternity
[39:19] right Earth Heaven and Earth will kiss
[39:23] together right and this is going to be
[39:25] our home Glory praise God but it ain't
[39:29] going to be in the condition that we see
[39:30] it right now
[39:32] Saints there's not going to be any devil
[39:34] there's not going to be any demons
[39:35] there's not going to be any movements
[39:37] there's not going to be any of that such
[39:39] things no virus no anything like that
[39:41] amen there's nothing going to be the but
[39:43] the Bride In Christ amen and his
[39:46] original
[39:48] creation and whatever else God wants to
[39:50] give us right cuz I don't think that
[39:52] we're going to stop learning from God
[39:54] when we get there right he he's an
[39:56] eternal God and there is no ending to
[39:59] what we're going to be able to man he's
[40:00] just a circle he's a circle and we just
[40:03] continue learning there's no there's no
[40:05] there a circle has no
[40:07] end you see that's why I like that song
[40:10] will The Circle Be Unbroken amen there's
[40:13] no Circle that's why it's represented
[40:15] eternal life is represented as a circle
[40:18] or as a number eight there's no ending
[40:21] to it amen praise
[40:23] God verse 54 I'm going I'm going to I'm
[40:26] going to make sure that you guys leave
[40:28] early tonight so I kept you a while last
[40:32] time so I don't want to keep you tonight
[40:34] too long verse 54 says so when this
[40:37] corruptible shall have put on
[40:41] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[40:44] put on
[40:45] immortality then shall be brought to
[40:48] pass the saying that is written death is
[40:51] swallowed up in Victory oh my and and
[40:56] Paul again he positive about these
[40:58] changes taking place right he is not
[41:01] negative about it he knows that it's
[41:03] going to be praise God again how much
[41:06] more should we should we be positive and
[41:09] know that these things are going to be
[41:11] do you know that this this phrase death
[41:13] is swallowed up in Victory is found in
[41:15] in Isaiah chapter
[41:17] 25 so Paul many things that Paul would
[41:20] say many phrases that he would say he
[41:23] really was saying or reiterating
[41:25] something that was already said in the
[41:26] old test
[41:28] and and we read it in Isaiah 25:6 now
[41:31] listen to this look what look what Look
[41:33] What the Lord through Isaiah is speaking
[41:35] is speaking here very interesting it
[41:38] says and in this mountain I like that
[41:41] amen CU we're coming to that we're
[41:44] coming to that Mountaintop amen shall
[41:47] the Lord of hosts make unto all people a
[41:50] feast of fat things a feast of wines on
[41:54] the leaves of fat things full of marrow
[41:57] of of wines on the leaves well refined
[41:59] verse 7 and he will destroy in this
[42:02] mountain the face of the covering cast
[42:05] over all
[42:07] people and the veil that is spread over
[42:09] all nations he will destroy in this
[42:13] mountain the face covering cast over all
[42:16] people amen praise
[42:18] God that's that covering that we have
[42:21] right now this this Mortal body that we
[42:23] have Upon Us amen God's going to get get
[42:26] rid of that amen all right God's it's
[42:28] already working in
[42:30] us and it's going to be it's going to be
[42:33] shred to pieces one day amen praise God
[42:36] and completely come out it's kind of
[42:37] like like I don't know if you've seen an
[42:39] animal shed its skin or you've seen the
[42:41] the the skin of a of a snake on the side
[42:44] they there's a struggle you know there's
[42:47] a struggle sometimes as they coming out
[42:48] and it's even kind of filming their eyes
[42:50] and things like that amen but eventually
[42:53] they come out right the the the thing is
[42:57] left there is that is that old skin amen
[43:00] praise God and they're walking around
[43:01] with a new with a new body amen with a
[43:05] new amen and so he will destroy in this
[43:08] mountain the face of the covering cast
[43:10] over all people and the veil that is
[43:12] spread over all nations now watch verse
[43:14] eight he says he will swallow up death
[43:17] in Victory exactly what Paul said there
[43:19] in verse
[43:21] 54 and the Lord God will wipe away tears
[43:25] from off all faces and the rebuke of his
[43:28] people shall he take away from off all
[43:31] the Earth for the Lord hath spoken it
[43:34] glory amen and that and it shall be said
[43:37] in that day Lo This Is Our God we have
[43:41] waited for him and he will save us this
[43:43] is the Lord we have waited for him and
[43:46] he will be glad and rejoice in his
[43:48] salvation hallelujah amen but you see
[43:52] you should be saying that now you don't
[43:54] wait till we get there you say it now
[43:56] amen so has even more meaning when
[43:58] you're saying it then amen praise God oh
[44:02] we thank God for his salvation thank God
[44:05] for his word amen thank God for his
[44:07] transforming power in our lives amen
[44:10] without him we would be nothing right
[44:12] amen we without him we would be falling
[44:14] amen without him we'd be in a hospital
[44:16] or in a casket somewhere in this hour I
[44:18] know I would be if it wasn't for what
[44:21] he's done for us and his Mercy the mercy
[44:23] and the grace that he's that he's shed
[44:25] abroad our hearts amen
[44:27] praise
[44:28] God Amen and Pa Paul continues saying in
[44:32] that last part of the verse then shall
[44:34] be brought to pass saying that is
[44:35] written death is swallowed up in Victory
[44:37] and in Hebrews chap
[44:39] 2:14 the Bible tells us amen for as much
[44:42] then as the children are partakers of
[44:44] Flesh and Blood that's that's you and I
[44:47] right we're partakers of Flesh and Blood
[44:49] he also speaking of Jesus he also
[44:52] himself likewise took part of the same
[44:56] but why did he he do it the Bible says
[44:59] there that through death he might
[45:01] destroy him that had the power of death
[45:06] that is the devil exactly
[45:09] right how it's so amazing how God thinks
[45:13] amen Satan always thinks that he has
[45:15] something over God right and God is
[45:18] always several steps
[45:21] ahead amen and that's the god that you
[45:23] and I serve in this hour amen it took a
[45:26] death to D destroy uh the power of
[45:28] death amen it took God dying it took it
[45:33] took Jesus Christ dying on the cross in
[45:35] order to destroy the one who had those
[45:37] keys of death Hell In The
[45:40] Grave amen praise God and that death is
[45:44] swallowed up in Victory as Paul's saying
[45:46] here death is swallowed up in Victory
[45:49] amen
[45:51] amen now verse 55 says oh death where is
[45:54] thy
[45:55] sting oh grave where is thy
[45:58] Victory amen so since death has been
[46:01] swallowed up in in in in has been
[46:04] swallowed up then Paul comes here and
[46:06] asks where is thy
[46:08] sting where oh grave where is thy
[46:11] victory in other words what you have
[46:13] no you have no uh uh um you have no more
[46:17] influence upon upon upon the believer
[46:21] right there's no more influence there
[46:23] Satan thinks he has influence on the
[46:25] believer amen and if you he will have
[46:27] influence if you allow him right he has
[46:30] influence right amen but as but
[46:33] as the thing is that Satan when he when
[46:37] he's uh he met his challenge there on
[46:39] the
[46:40] cross he was that he was that bee
[46:42] brother Brown talks about it that bee
[46:44] that that that was flying buzzing around
[46:46] and saying I'm going to get you I'm
[46:49] going to get you isn't that isn't that
[46:51] what Satan sometimes comes around
[46:53] talking to us say I'm going to get you
[46:55] you're feeling this oh you hurt right
[46:58] here oh it could be a clogged artery
[47:03] oh oh yeah yeah and you're trying you're
[47:06] calling you're seeing who who you're
[47:08] looking on Google what is this pain what
[47:11] is this what is this symptom what
[47:14] is and and you know the more you're
[47:18] sitting there looking through Google and
[47:19] reading WebMD and all that when you
[47:21] could just be going to the word of God
[47:23] Amen and reading the promises of God and
[47:26] saying his stripes I am healed amen he
[47:29] died for my for my healing amen right
[47:32] praise God and we have more faith in
[47:34] Google and Facebook and and and these
[47:36] these things than we do the word of God
[47:39] WebMD has more more influence in our
[47:41] lives than the word right in the message
[47:45] well you know it's the truth I've been
[47:47] there done that I have the t-shirt and
[47:49] the mouse pad to go on with it to go
[47:51] with
[47:54] it listen I'm with you I I you know I I
[47:58] just turned 40 and every now and then
[48:01] now I'm feeling little aches or some
[48:03] little things that just come and and I
[48:06] and I know if I'm feeling them now the
[48:07] more I live probably it's going to get
[48:09] worse just things just random things
[48:12] just
[48:12] [Laughter]
[48:17] come you Brothers I know you Brothers
[48:20] can say this it's probably worse I know
[48:24] but just little things
[48:28] [Laughter]
[48:32] but you know
[48:34] what I know that it's because this
[48:36] body's dying right this body is not
[48:40] Eternal there's an eternal one inside of
[48:43] theide of
[48:44] it that is wanting to come out and
[48:47] express itself completely in this flesh
[48:49] as well in this Flesh and Blood amen but
[48:52] when that time comes
[48:54] amen you won't be worrying about your
[48:56] little pains and AES anymore know those
[48:59] things amen WebMD what is
[49:03] that Google ah oh death where is thy
[49:08] sting oh grave where is thy Victory so
[49:12] Satan he had met his challenge there
[49:14] when he stung Jesus At The Cross now now
[49:17] brother Wade was here he'd probably he'd
[49:19] probably be be able to confirm but you
[49:21] know how brother Wade he works with
[49:23] honeybees and a honeybee from my
[49:26] understanding is the only be that if it
[49:28] stings for example a human being or
[49:31] something a mammal uh when they try to
[49:35] when they try to get
[49:37] away it rips their whole the stinger out
[49:41] out of them and completely deuts them
[49:44] from the in I mean their intestines come
[49:46] out and and uh uh and and they die they
[49:50] end up dying now a wasp or or a Hornet
[49:54] or some of those you know those other
[49:57] types of bees they can sting you and
[49:59] they can continually they can they can
[50:01] take it out and and go on and sting
[50:03] another day but a honeybee can't do that
[50:07] amen now a honeybee think about this
[50:09] Saints a honeybee is probably one of the
[50:13] least bees that we are we are scared of
[50:16] when there's a wasp flying around or
[50:19] when there's a hornet flying around or
[50:21] or or or something like that we you know
[50:24] we start
[50:25] waving you know we get scared you know
[50:28] but a honey bee you know when it's
[50:29] flying around you know and and it's uh
[50:32] you some some of us some of us are just
[50:34] scared of any be but but when it's we
[50:38] they're more tolerable they're actually
[50:40] a little bit more cuter you
[50:42] see I know that sting is not
[50:46] cute and they're
[50:49] fuzzy but think about the Saints brother
[50:52] Brandon said that Satan was like that
[50:54] bee flying around Jesus amen
[50:57] and he wasn't a hornet he wasn't a wasp
[51:01] he wasn't as powerful as a as one of
[51:03] those wasps and hornets he was just a
[51:05] honeybee with a stinger that when it got
[51:08] into Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ
[51:11] there on the cross he thinking that he
[51:13] had power over him over Jesus stung
[51:16] Jesus amen with the power of death and
[51:18] that completely de de gted uh Satan
[51:22] completely amen all his Machinery all of
[51:25] the keys everything was stripped from
[51:27] him and now what Satan is is just a dead
[51:30] honeybee flopping around all around
[51:33] you buzzing around with no Stinger
[51:38] completely and he sounds like he like
[51:41] he's like like like he's something
[51:42] dangerous in reality he's
[51:45] not he's actually in a worse condition
[51:47] now than he was before he got a hold of
[51:49] Jesus
[51:51] right exactly he's just a dead bee
[51:53] flopping around
[51:56] amen he sounds like he's dangerous he
[51:59] looks like he's dangerous but he's not
[52:01] dangerous amen so when he comes around
[52:04] saying you're about to die you got a
[52:06] clogged
[52:07] artery you you're you're about to you
[52:10] got some problem with your back or
[52:12] something on that line amen you can just
[52:14] say Satan you're just flopping
[52:17] around you're just flopping around
[52:19] you've been de gutted do you remember
[52:21] when Jesus died and he W and when he
[52:24] when he died and went went in the grave
[52:26] when they B married him amen he went to
[52:28] hell and the Bible and brother brand
[52:31] says that he went in there and took the
[52:33] keys and stripped them off Satan he said
[52:36] give me those keys those keys belong to
[52:38] me and Satan has no keys he brother R
[52:41] said he has the KE does not even have
[52:43] the keys to his own house right he's
[52:46] powerless especially powerless before
[52:49] you and I who have the Holy Ghost in our
[52:51] in our soul that's right amen he's just
[52:53] a sound a sound and and a tinkling
[52:58] symbol just making
[53:00] noise
[53:02] amen now one of the peculiar things
[53:05] about bees about honey bees and about
[53:07] bees in general is that when they sting
[53:10] you and they're going to die apparently
[53:13] they release these
[53:15] pheromones that that if they're nearby
[53:17] if they're near the the the the nest uh
[53:21] these alert pheromones that that alert
[53:24] other bees to come for you know to come
[53:27] in and and and and for help you see and
[53:31] uh and that's exactly what Satan has
[53:34] done the Bible says that he's called the
[53:37] Bible says that 200 thousands and
[53:38] thousands of the demons have been
[53:40] released in this hour exactly amen cuz
[53:43] Satan can't do it all he needs his
[53:45] demons he needs his minions to come in
[53:47] and we've seen it in this hour Saints
[53:49] demons upon demon do you think do you
[53:51] think what's currently going on in this
[53:53] country amen it's not been demons being
[53:55] released that's right right amen that's
[53:58] affecting the the I mean it's it's
[54:00] supposed to tr affect us amen how much
[54:03] more is it going to affect the world
[54:04] that has that doesn't even have God that
[54:07] doesn't even have a hope Amen in in in
[54:10] in nothing but what this what this world
[54:13] order can give them right
[54:17] W 200,000 thousands demons have been
[54:22] released praise God and so that's what
[54:25] Satan Satan needs is is he demon because
[54:27] he knows he has no power over you and I
[54:30] right he knows that his time is limited
[54:34] he knows that his time is is uh is
[54:37] uh he's got a limit to his time here so
[54:41] he's doing everything he can to get you
[54:44] if you more if he can get you to
[54:45] disbelieve that word amen go in there
[54:48] and on them websites and and look at
[54:51] what well this here look what the bridge
[54:56] and the cloud and all these things you
[54:58] know Satan's on the rampant on the
[55:00] Rampage doing that and he's got his
[55:01] minions working behind the
[55:04] scenes amen but we're powerful people in
[55:07] this hour Glory praise God verse 56 says
[55:11] the sting of death is sin and the
[55:14] strength of sin is the law amen now I
[55:18] want us to look at something here
[55:20] because death could not work without sin
[55:23] being in the picture see
[55:27] sin and death they work together amen
[55:31] the more you sin the more you engage in
[55:34] sin the more spiritual dying you're
[55:37] you're you're you're
[55:38] doing you see and sometimes eventually
[55:41] that might lead to physical death you
[55:44] take for example the innocent young man
[55:46] that raised probably went to school went
[55:48] to college but one day got a hold of of
[55:51] of of marijuana went to a party one day
[55:54] got a hold of marijuana started smoking
[55:57] marijuana and oh I can handle this this
[56:00] is fine I know I was raised in a
[56:02] Christian home but this is okay then the
[56:05] marijuana doesn't do anything for him
[56:07] anymore so he goes on he he he goes on
[56:09] the next step a little bit of crack
[56:12] cocaine that eventually phases out now
[56:15] he goes to the next thing heroin or or
[56:17] you know whatever the harder drug the
[56:19] harder drug it is and and the more sin
[56:22] that he's engaging in he's dying
[56:25] spiritually and eventually That Dying
[56:27] spiritually that sin will eventually
[56:30] lead him to a physical death that's
[56:31] right you see so the the Bible was not
[56:35] incorrect when it said in in for example
[56:37] in James if you read with me and the
[56:39] brothers can pull it up James chapter
[56:41] 1:14 says but every man is tempted when
[56:45] he is drawn away of his own lust and
[56:49] enticed right you see when that when
[56:52] that when that guy came around you and
[56:54] said hey let's go out to this party this
[56:56] Friday
[56:57] night you
[56:59] know well you you know exactly what's
[57:01] going to go on
[57:03] there but because you want to fit
[57:05] in you just go ahead and do
[57:08] it and so when he has drawn away of his
[57:11] own lust and enticed verse 15 says then
[57:13] when lust in other words I've been
[57:16] thinking about it should I should I not
[57:19] yo man
[57:20] this man this might make make me fit in
[57:23] a little bit better with the guys I've
[57:24] been wanting to to you know to get
[57:26] around them you know oh and so that lust
[57:29] starts working you see that's the lust
[57:31] part when lust hath
[57:34] conceived right it bringeth forth sin
[57:37] right all
[57:39] right and then sin when it is
[57:42] finished it bringeth forth death right
[57:49] right now you could take that spiritual
[57:52] death and it could lead to physical
[57:54] death too see
[57:56] but but Saints being spiritual dead amen
[57:59] it's probably worse CU you especially
[58:03] you living in iniquity and you know that
[58:04] you're you're you're living in sin and
[58:06] you know that you need to get right and
[58:08] you're still not doing what you're
[58:10] supposed to do amen that's a terrible
[58:12] way to live I remember when I was out in
[58:15] the world when I was young and and uh I
[58:17] had not known the message I had not come
[58:19] to the message yet but I was still a
[58:20] Baptist but my mom and dad had taught me
[58:23] better had raised me better you know and
[58:25] the Baptist in the Baptist ways and the
[58:27] Baptist Doctrine and the Baptist life
[58:30] and I got away from that I got away from
[58:33] that to go party to go drink to go these
[58:35] things and all all this stuff but the
[58:37] whole time my whole life I could not
[58:40] really fit in with the people oh yeah it
[58:43] was like I'm sitting there having fun
[58:45] but at the same time I'm not it is a
[58:48] terrible feeling I know some of you
[58:50] probably know what I'm talking about
[58:52] it's a it's a it's a terrible feeling
[58:54] you can't and you see that there
[58:56] rejoicing and having fun and and and and
[58:58] it doesn't bother them to do this that
[59:00] or the other
[59:02] but I couldn't fully get into what they
[59:05] were doing yeah because why the word of
[59:07] God had already been had been planted in
[59:10] my life right
[59:12] amen I hope you don't come to that place
[59:14] young man young young girl young amen
[59:17] serve God that you have the opportunity
[59:19] to do so now cuz then later on you may
[59:22] not have that
[59:23] opportunity amen serve him now while you
[59:27] can take advantage now of church take
[59:29] advantage now of the things that your
[59:32] parents are trying to do for you to help
[59:34] you to live a more uh vibrant life in
[59:37] Christ amen don't say it don't see it as
[59:40] oh I'm so bored I can't wait till this
[59:42] service gets
[59:43] out I want to go home and play
[59:48] Playstation what is that going to do for
[59:50] your soul right what is sports going to
[59:53] do for your soul it can't take you to
[59:56] Glory yeah you're not going to you're
[59:58] not going to heaven with a basketball in
[1:00:00] your
[1:00:01] hand that's not
[1:00:04] Eternal
[1:00:09] amen it's okay you if you play
[1:00:12] basketball it's okay if you play some
[1:00:14] video games or whatever but don't put
[1:00:15] that before
[1:00:17] God you put that before God then that's
[1:00:19] your God PlayStation and Xbox is your
[1:00:22] god and your word is not your God right
[1:00:25] amen and maybe you'll understand when
[1:00:27] you get if you get older you might think
[1:00:30] that crank up there that all he talks
[1:00:33] about is me getting right amen but you
[1:00:35] realize when you get older and you've
[1:00:36] and you've passed through something in
[1:00:38] your life on the verge of dying I've
[1:00:41] been on that on that verge of almost
[1:00:43] dying drowning in an ocean just a few
[1:00:46] years ago and if it wasn't for the grace
[1:00:48] of God I don't know I I'd be dead
[1:00:53] tonight so so the more that we engage in
[1:00:56] sin Saints is the more you are dying
[1:00:58] spiritually
[1:01:00] amen and what fueled sin was having to
[1:01:03] abide by the law amen now Paul says here
[1:01:08] and the strength of the sin is the law
[1:01:10] amen and and what fueled that more is
[1:01:13] the fact is knowing that you could not
[1:01:15] even keep the law right you see right
[1:01:18] what a what a what a what a thing to to
[1:01:21] know God has given us this law you know
[1:01:24] and for the for the Saints in the old
[1:01:25] test I mean for the for the for the
[1:01:27] Israelites but they couldn't fulfill the
[1:01:30] law and God knew that they could not do
[1:01:32] it but that's the reason why Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ came and fulfilled that law for
[1:01:37] us amen he came and did it for us amen

[1:17:08] Saints amen uh yes sister go
[1:17:17] ahead I heard about it maybe maybe a
[1:17:20] week ago and um I was I was on my
[1:17:23] YouTube page um and stuff but anyway
[1:17:26] this this channel came up and um the
[1:17:29] speaker from Israel was saying how they
[1:17:33] have actually started preaching about
[1:17:35] Jesus Christ there and they've been
[1:17:37] doing it for five years now and how
[1:17:39] they're so excited for this New Hope and
[1:17:40] everything and that they're spreading
[1:17:42] the gospel and everything to me I didn't
[1:17:44] even know that I didn't know that was
[1:17:45] already going on and that's an eye
[1:17:47] opener because I know brother BR
[1:17:48] mentioned something about watch Israel
[1:17:50] if you want to know what time it is
[1:17:52] right right I also know about um how
[1:17:55] Jesus was saying he's going to turn from
[1:17:56] the Gentiles and go to the Jews I don't
[1:17:58] I probably don't have it all you know
[1:18:00] and I I probably got to listen to the
[1:18:02] message get it all clear but I didn't
[1:18:04] know it was even that close to where
[1:18:06] they actually already believing in Jesus
[1:18:08] Christ amen he was saying um how they
[1:18:10] had um it's Israel population is about 9
[1:18:14] million but it's been 27 million Jews
[1:18:18] already just on their website learning
[1:18:20] about all this and they're saying how
[1:18:21] excited they are and how they got this
[1:18:23] new hope now and
[1:18:25] um they're just excited about this yeah
[1:18:27] and they they didn't know about it and
[1:18:29] they I mean I was I was shocked to hear
[1:18:31] about it I don't know if anybody else
[1:18:32] heard about it praise the Lord yeah
[1:18:35] thank you for sharing that sister yes
[1:18:37] that there's Jews in the in the world
[1:18:39] and even throughout the world who who
[1:18:41] who are they they they know Jesus Christ
[1:18:44] and they they believe in Jesus Christ
[1:18:46] maybe th that group might be an
[1:18:48] influence to what's coming later with
[1:18:50] the two witnesses I'm not sure but but I
[1:18:52] believe things are transitioning amen
[1:18:55] the holy spirit is leaving amen is is
[1:18:57] brother Bram said that the holy spirit
[1:18:58] is is is leaving this this Gentile this
[1:19:01] Gentile and moving back to Israel is
[1:19:03] going to deal with the with the with the
[1:19:06] Israel but those two witnesses have to
[1:19:08] be on the scene right amen because the
[1:19:11] thing is those two witnesses would come
[1:19:12] with the spirit of Elijah and the spirit
[1:19:14] of of of Moses uh and uh they're they're
[1:19:19] not going to listen to anybody but their
[1:19:20] own prophets right so that that's got to
[1:19:22] be influential so that's very very good
[1:19:25] that that's and that could be a
[1:19:26] transitioning thing that might be
[1:19:28] happening so Saints you know it's seeing
[1:19:31] these things happen together and and the
[1:19:33] views that because people are interested
[1:19:35] in that I mean even the nominal world
[1:19:37] they're interested in what happens in
[1:19:38] Israel oh yeah so it's probably why
[1:19:40] those those those those videos have so
[1:19:43] many views um because people are have
[1:19:46] their eyes there on what happens in
[1:19:47] Israel so they're they're God's time
[1:19:50] piece they're God's time clock amen you
[1:19:53] want to know what God's doing you look
[1:19:55] at what's happening in Israel look what
[1:19:56] God's doing in Israel amen amen anybody
[1:19:59] else have a comment or Brother D every
