[0:40] I wasn't
[0:41] there by the shores of
[0:47] [Music]
[0:49] Galilee when Jesus touched those blinded
[0:54] eyes and made them
[0:57] [Music]
[0:59] see. And though I did not see the empty
[1:05] tomb that day, I still
[1:10] believe for I know what Jesus did
[1:16] for me.
[1:21] I
[1:22] believe there is
[1:25] power in the blood of the
[1:30] lamb. I
[1:33] believe there is
[1:36] healing in the touch
[1:39] of his hand.
[1:42] [Music]
[1:44] But the
[1:46] greatest of our
[1:48] miracles was when
[1:51] Jesus saved me.
[1:54] Yes, I know what Jesus
[1:59] did for me.
[2:05] Now I have seen the lowest things
[2:09] in sick
[2:14] soul. Have life a
[2:17] new made
[2:19] pure pure and whole.
[2:25] And I have felt him loose through chains
[2:29] of sins and set my spirit
[2:35] free. Yes, I know what Jesus did. Amen.
[2:43] [Music]
[2:46] I
[2:48] believe there is
[2:51] power in the blood of the
[2:56] lamb. I
[2:58] believe there is
[3:01] healing in the touch of his hand.
[3:06] [Music]
[3:10] But the
[3:11] greatest of all
[3:14] miracles was when
[3:16] Jesus saved
[3:19] me. Yes, I know what Jesus did
[3:25] for
[3:29] me. Oh yes, I know what Jesus

[8:16] and you'll break into another dimension.
[8:22] Amen. But we're on this side. We're in
[8:25] the first three. So, he decided to come
[8:29] over here with us. Amen. We don't have
[8:31] to go get him. He's right here. Right.
[8:33] Glory. He's right here in this
[8:35] dimension. I said he decided to be in
[8:37] this dimension. He decided to be here in
[8:42] another form called a bride. Glory. You
[8:46] love the Lord. Amen. Hope you enjoyed
[8:48] this morning. Amen.
[8:51] So did I.
[8:53] By way of announcements, remember also
[8:55] the fellowship meeting next Saturday,
[8:58] Brother Gerald Hughes at 3:30.
[9:00] Uh remember June and I will be leaving
[9:02] on the 23rd of March going to Brother
[9:05] Ron Spencer for the weekend. We'll be
[9:07] driving back on the 26th which will be
[9:09] on Monday. So keep us in your prayers.
[9:12] Also want to kind of stick a little seed
[9:13] in your in your brain, something to
[9:16] think about. J and I are going out to
[9:18] brother Jim Pinson's in May, which will
[9:20] be Memorial Day or Memorial Weekend,
[9:24] which will be the 24th through the 28th.
[9:28] And those are May meetings at brother
[9:29] Pinson. But I'm not preaching them
[9:31] unless he asked them to get out there.
[9:32] But I'm not going to preach. I'm going
[9:34] out there to fellowship with them, have
[9:35] a little time of vacation. I think
[9:37] brother Mark and Brother Donnie have had
[9:40] placed some interest that they'd like to
[9:42] go. So just kind of keep in your mind if
[9:44] you'd like to go, we might caravan it
[9:46] out there. We did it one time. We went
[9:47] to Oklahoma. Brother Danny and Sister
[9:49] Joyce and uh Brother Ray and a bunch of
[9:52] us got together and took the church van
[9:54] and went out there. So if y'all would
[9:55] like to go with us, we're going. We
[9:57] already made our reservations. They got
[9:59] a few places for you to stay, but um we
[10:02] may have a uh we may have a rolling uh
[10:05] ramada in if the brothers take their uh
[10:08] motor home. So just keep that in your
[10:10] mind. We got a little time, but just
[10:12] keep that in your prayers. Also, I was
[10:15] thinking about this the other day in
[10:16] June. remember all the
[10:19] um men on Father's Day. Remember we
[10:22] still going, Lord willing, going to have
[10:24] the Father's Day up in the mountains
[10:27] camping and and fishing. So just keep
[10:28] that in your mind there in June coming
[10:31] up. So we'll just give you kind of a
[10:33] time. I June and I sat down the other
[10:35] day and I said, "Well, we're not going
[10:36] to let anything sneak up on us this
[10:39] year. We're going to take our whole
[10:40] calendar and go all the way to December
[10:42] and kind of write in everything we we
[10:44] have." So, I'm just kind of bringing
[10:45] that to your remembrance cuz sometimes
[10:46] it slips up on you. But 1 Peter chapter
[10:57] 3, we'll begin with the first verse.
[10:59] Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, we
[11:01] pray again Lord that you'd come among us
[11:03] in a special way, Lord. Anoint the eyes
[11:06] and the ears, Lord, and anoint the
[11:08] speaker, Father. take us, Lord, and let
[11:11] us come under your headship, Father, and
[11:13] the headship of the word and let it let
[11:15] it just resonate through our being and
[11:17] and go out to the people, Lord, and be
[11:21] received, Father, as it was given. If
[11:23] that happens, Lord, then we'll have a
[11:25] really good time in you, Lord. We pray
[11:27] that you'd bless the ones that are sick,
[11:29] Lord, the ones that are not with us,
[11:30] ones that are listening in, Lord, be
[11:32] with them and bless them. Bless the
[11:34] missionaries on the foreign field. Be
[11:36] with them. Take care of them, Lord. Give
[11:38] them fruit for their labor, Father. Give
[11:40] them, Lord, strength for their journey.
[11:42] Bless us all and give us strength here,
[11:44] Lord. Take care of us. Lead us and guide
[11:46] us by your Holy Spirit. Let every word
[11:48] be said be said with honesty, with a
[11:50] contrite heart. Be be something that
[11:52] that we would, Lord. Just want to live
[11:56] for you, Father. Daily walking in you.
[11:59] That's what we want to do, Lord. Not not
[12:02] having any condemnation. there in Romans
[12:04] 8. There's therefore now no condemnation
[12:07] to them that are in Christ Jesus who
[12:08] walk not after the flesh but after the
[12:10] spirit. Lord, we know we have to walk in
[12:12] the flesh, but we don't have to walk of
[12:14] the flesh. We Lord be separated from
[12:16] this world and Lord truly bring us to a
[12:18] higher calling. Bring us to a calling to
[12:21] where truly if we walk through a or meet
[12:24] people that say, "Wow, that man's
[12:26] different or that sister's different.
[12:28] They're living a different kind of life.
[12:29] They're they're consecrating theirel to
[12:32] God." Father, just be with us and bless
[12:34] us. We praise your great name, the name
[12:36] of Jesus Christ.
[12:37] Amen. Chapter 3:1. Likewise, you wives
[12:41] being subject to your own husband, that
[12:44] if any obey not the word, they also may
[12:47] without the word be one by the
[12:49] conversation of the wives. Right. You
[12:51] ever read that before? Yeah. Pretty
[12:53] neat, huh? Didn't say conversation of
[12:56] the husband.
[12:57] Sisters, you're more living example than
[12:59] we are, but we'll get into that later
[13:01] on. While they behold your chasteed or
[13:04] clean conversation coupled with fear and
[13:07] that's not fear of like Adam had fear
[13:09] that's with godly fear that we do
[13:12] something wrong for in front of God
[13:14] whose adorning let it not be that
[13:17] outward adorning of platting the hair or
[13:20] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[13:22] but let it be the hidden man of the
[13:23] heart and that which is not corruptible
[13:27] even the ornament of a meek and quiet
[13:29] spirit which is in the sight of God of
[13:30] great price. In other words, God really
[13:32] likes that. Amen. All right. For after
[13:35] this manner in the old time, the holy
[13:37] women also who trusted in God adorned
[13:39] themselves being in
[13:43] subjug obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord,
[13:46] whose daughters ye are, as long as you
[13:48] do well, and are not afraid with any
[13:51] amazement. Likewise, ye
[13:54] husbands, excuse me, dwell with them
[13:56] according to
[13:57] knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as
[14:00] unto the weaker vessel, and as being hes
[14:04] and the original says, joint hes
[14:05] together of the grace of life, that your
[14:09] prayers be not hindered. The Lord add
[14:11] his blessing to the reading the word.
[14:12] You can be
[14:13] seated. We're just going to kind of
[14:15] review just a few minutes from from this
[14:18] morning just for a background. We we
[14:20] remember that we come and and we showed
[14:22] that we're to establish headship. Amen.
[14:25] The male or the man or the husband needs
[14:27] to understand his role so that you can
[14:30] know how to act and react to situations
[14:32] in a marriage. We put that up on the
[14:34] board and brother Joe and him are real
[14:35] gracious. They're actually copying off
[14:38] my
[14:39] notes and we're able to read
[14:42] that and put it on there for you to take
[14:44] off the internet. So it's everything you
[14:46] need. If you have any other questions,
[14:48] you don't even have to call me. just
[14:49] pull it off the internet, right? Cuz
[14:50] it's right there in in black and white.
[14:52] All right. Try not to bring any of my
[14:54] opinions in this into this. Try to just
[14:56] bring it strictly by the word of God. I
[14:58] know we have to make comments, but we
[15:00] want to try to understand what the
[15:02] prophet said about it, what the
[15:04] scripture says about it. Put those two
[15:05] together. And hey, we're under that.
[15:08] We're under that umbrella of eternal
[15:10] life. Cuz that's the eternal word of
[15:12] God. And the prophets the prophet's
[15:14] message that he brought is eternal.
[15:17] All right. So that's what we got. We got
[15:19] this, you know, we got this to be under.
[15:22] But see, so we see that where the
[15:24] headship comes from. Comes from God down
[15:27] to Christ down to the male or the
[15:30] husband and then down to the wife. So we
[15:32] have to we establish the headship or the
[15:34] position this morning that a man is
[15:37] supposed to be obedient to that
[15:39] position. See, we brother talked a lot
[15:42] about the woman having a bad
[15:44] disposition. It's because she's the
[15:47] Bible. Brother Brandham said, you know,
[15:48] she in marriage and divorce. She said
[15:50] ordinary if she wants to be. All right?
[15:53] But he don't say a whole lot about the
[15:54] men. But I'm telling you, you some of us
[15:56] men get a little orary, too. I know,
[15:58] right?
[16:00] But we need to be obedient to the
[16:03] position of headship cuz Christ is not
[16:05] that way to us.
[16:08] He's not that way to us. He is not. No
[16:11] way. As
[16:14] you go through life with your mate, I'm
[16:17] trying to pick my words just right, with
[16:20] your
[16:21] spouse and you act the way you act. God
[16:25] sees that. God knows what his position
[16:30] is. Right. He's the head of all things.
[16:33] Right. Right. He's watching to see what
[16:35] you do. And if we're going on to this
[16:38] adoption stage, what happens during the
[16:40] adoption stage? See, we could preach
[16:43] this way on into adoption cuz your
[16:45] misbehavior, the prophet said, one
[16:48] misbehavior in a church can make the
[16:51] whole church fail.
[16:54] One,
[16:56] one misbehavior. So what we're trying to
[16:59] bring everything and line it up, get it
[17:02] straight in line to where the man, see
[17:05] this is a what? This is called a head
[17:07] stone, right? All right. So, we must
[17:10] have a head Christ and then we're what?
[17:14] Part of the body. Amen. Cuz this is the
[17:17] body. I love that picture. You know,
[17:19] they got a picture of this with Jesus
[17:20] standing in here and here's his body and
[17:22] his head right here. It's a beautiful
[17:24] picture. We don't have it up here. We
[17:27] may have it in a computer, but it's a
[17:28] beautiful picture cuz that's what it is.
[17:29] We're his what? We're his body.
[17:32] We're his body. Your wife is supposed to
[17:34] be your body. Amen. She's supposed to be
[17:37] an extension of you. Glory to God.
[17:41] Think about that a while.
[17:46] But the female or the the the wife
[17:49] should also understand what the male's
[17:52] role is so she can help him. Amen.
[17:57] Don't ever hinder your husband. Yeah.
[17:59] Right. Help him. help him fulfill his
[18:02] role according to God's word. Now, we're
[18:05] going to get into something this
[18:06] afternoon because there was a question
[18:07] came up in between the service, but I
[18:10] just wasn't finished with my sermon yet.
[18:12] It was on down a little bit further in
[18:14] my notes. But the male, the man, the
[18:16] husband is to be ahead of the house.
[18:19] Right. Right. He's supposed to initiate
[18:22] or to what? Have the initiative. Right.
[18:25] To instruct in the principles of
[18:27] something, to start something. All
[18:29] right. And I'm just skimming through my
[18:32] nose. Whatever is needed into this
[18:33] relationship should be started by the
[18:35] male or the husband. His role is to
[18:37] initiate whatever is needed to line up
[18:40] with the word of God. Amen. All right.
[18:42] Line up with the word of God. Not
[18:44] anything else. Not what some what so and
[18:47] so said or this one
[18:48] said. You know, it's kind of like Dave
[18:50] Ramsey says, he said, "You're going to
[18:52] take your broke cousin's opinion over
[18:54] mine."
[18:56] He's a millionaire. Yeah. He said, "But
[18:58] you'll say, well, my cousin said, well,
[19:00] yeah, your cousin's broke, you know, so,
[19:02] you know, so let's don't get our
[19:04] opinions from somewhere else, right?"
[19:07] Prophet's message, five-fold ministry,
[19:11] word of God. That's right. Word of God's
[19:13] our head, right? Filters right down. If
[19:15] we line up with that, we're in perfect
[19:18] order, right? All right. We're in our
[19:20] what position?
[19:22] Ain't that what Ain't that what brother
[19:25] B said. that the bride is out of
[19:27] position. Just paraphrasing. We're out
[19:29] of position. We're out of source. We got
[19:31] this one won't be this and this one
[19:33] won't be that. No, let's men be men,
[19:35] right? Women be women, husbands be
[19:37] husbands, wife be wives, and we'll get a
[19:40] lot further than just thinking we're way
[19:42] up here in this headstone up here and
[19:44] and you know, ready to go home. Maybe we
[19:48] need to get our home straightened out
[19:49] before we can go home. All right. Govern
[19:52] means to rule. Be the Lord.
[19:55] of your home to control, direct or
[19:57] strongly influence the action. You know,
[19:59] the best influence, that's why I made
[20:00] that point at the end. The best
[20:02] influence is a life live. Amen. I can
[20:05] sit here and tell you something all day
[20:07] long. But if you see me doing something
[20:09] contrary, what's the first thing you're
[20:11] going to do? I'm not trusting him
[20:13] anymore. Right? That's the first thing
[20:16] you're going to do. So then whatever
[20:17] else I say afterwards, even though it be
[20:19] true, right? Even though it be true.
[20:23] Right? you're not going to listen cuz
[20:25] you're not what you're afraid
[20:28] because you don't know what's going on.
[20:31] But now when you bring that thing back
[20:32] in line to govern is to control or
[20:35] direct or strongly influence the actions
[20:38] and conduct of others. All right? So man
[20:41] is not to rule with an iron fist but
[20:42] with what? Love and
[20:45] correction. Right? Same way, same way
[20:49] you get on to your wife is how God gets
[20:52] on to you. Amen. So, watch what you're
[20:54] doing. Right. Right. You turn and jump
[20:57] on your
[20:58] wife. God's liable to turn jump on you.
[21:00] Right. Cuz he's saying, "Hey, your wife
[21:02] may be acting the way she's acting
[21:04] because the way you're acting, big boy."
[21:07] Right. So, be careful. Let's watch what
[21:10] we're doing. All
[21:12] right. Initiate and govern. Headship.
[21:15] Keep those three words in mind. And
[21:17] remember at the very end I wrote the
[21:19] male is responsible.
[21:23] Anyone in a leadership role is
[21:24] responsible for those who who are being
[21:26] led. Right. And will answer before God
[21:29] for their role. Right. That's right.
[21:32] Like I said, Jacob did not start having
[21:34] a hallelujah time because remember he
[21:36] called the name of the place Bethl,
[21:38] right? Which is the house of God, right?
[21:40] He said this is a dreadful place, right?
[21:43] It's the place of correction. And it's
[21:44] the place that we come to to get all the
[21:47] the dross out and get all the let let's
[21:49] let let's let let's let let's let let's
[21:49] let let's let let's let let's let let's
[21:49] let let's let let the pastor beat the
[21:51] dross out of us. Let let the teacher
[21:53] come and and help us get in line. All
[21:55] right. Everybody say amen. Right. I'll
[21:59] keep you awake. I'm going to start
[22:00] making you say amen.
[22:03] Or oh me. You can say on me inside all
[22:04] that. Nobody really hear you. But don't
[22:06] say on me out loud at first. All right.
[22:09] Let's start with quote number 12. We'll
[22:11] back up to number 12 and start from
[22:14] there cuz I want to break out a point
[22:17] that I stopped at before I brought the
[22:19] point out. Now, I made the point was
[22:21] that and I was talking about the the
[22:23] brother left brother Clark's church. And
[22:25] I want to back up just a minute on that.
[22:28] But let's read the 12 and 13 and then
[22:30] I'll tell you exactly why I made the
[22:32] statement because I think maybe even
[22:35] when brother Clark said it that he kind
[22:36] of confused a few people or maybe we got
[22:38] confused oursel. I'll kind of I'll
[22:41] really clear it up for you in just a
[22:42] second. If I seen a man come in here
[22:44] with long hair hanging down his back
[22:46] like a woman, I'd say, "Mister, why
[22:48] don't you go to the barber shop?" You
[22:49] look like a woman. See, but men usually
[22:52] don't do that. In other words, he said,
[22:53] "Men usually don't have long hair."
[22:55] Yeah. See, not as man now, not as the
[22:58] infallibility of man. They're just as
[23:01] guilty as a woman. And by the way, a man
[23:03] that'll let his wife do that, what? Cut
[23:05] her hair. He's guilty double of it,
[23:08] right? cuz he's supposed to be the one
[23:10] that has to say so in the house. And
[23:12] that man can't even rule his own house.
[23:14] How could he do it in the house of God?
[23:16] Scroll all the way up. I'm not scolding
[23:17] you to be mean. I'm only so happy for
[23:20] you. I just don't want Satan to get a
[23:23] foot anywhere. He's talking about his
[23:24] people at his church in between there is
[23:26] what he's talking about at the same
[23:28] time. Don't ever let no man deceive you
[23:29] by some enchantments or something
[23:31] another like that or something saying,
[23:32] "Oh, well, it don't see." In other
[23:34] words, he's saying it don't matter.
[23:36] That's the way Satan interpreted the
[23:37] word to Eve. See, you believe just the
[23:39] words, what the word says. All right.
[23:42] Now, let's go to
[23:44] 13. Listen here. The man is a ruler.
[23:47] Don't you think you can rule the house?
[23:49] You're not the ruler of the house.
[23:50] Talking about the women. You're
[23:52] absolutely. You're not a slave now, but
[23:54] you're a helpmate. And Adam, the man has
[23:56] to rule over his wife, and he's
[23:59] responsible. There's that word,
[24:01] responsible solely for his wife. God
[24:04] makes a man answer for his wife. Now,
[24:06] read and see if God says that. In other
[24:08] words, that's so, right? All right. Now,
[24:11] let's go to the
[24:14] next. This is where I want to clear
[24:16] something
[24:17] up. In the story that Claude was
[24:20] telling, I'm over here. In the story
[24:22] that Claude was telling, y'all are
[24:24] reading and cheating. In the story that
[24:27] Claude was telling, brother Claude was
[24:29] telling was
[24:35] That the male
[24:38] that the male Why you sitting on front
[24:41] row? He usually sit back.
[24:44] My helpmate's not here. Your helpmate's
[24:46] not. You got it. Okay. So, he's on front
[24:48] row and I'm helping him. He waiting to
[24:49] go to sleep. I kick his boot. Y'all
[24:51] don't see that. Thank
[24:53] you. Anyway, I lost my thought. All
[24:56] right. Brother Claude. Brother CL. Thank
[24:58] you. Brother Claude was telling a story
[25:00] about the man going to this other church
[25:02] with his wife. Well, now the story that
[25:05] nobody knows behind all that is this
[25:07] brother's been in every doctrine in the
[25:09] world.
[25:11] The husband knows
[25:12] that. See, he's
[25:15] wrong. See, the
[25:17] wife, he needs to take his wife and go
[25:20] back to brother Claude, which I believe
[25:21] he's preaching the truth. Okay? So, that
[25:24] way he follows. But now if if if I were
[25:27] him, I'd say, "Okay, you go ahead and go
[25:28] over there where you're going. I'm
[25:30] staying here." Cuz see, when God is
[25:32] becomes the ruler
[25:34] over if you step out from under the word
[25:37] of God and you go to a church that don't
[25:40] preach the
[25:41] truth and your wife goes to one that
[25:44] does preach the truth, she's all right.
[25:46] You're the one that's wrong. Right? If
[25:49] you leave a church that's preaching the
[25:50] word of God and if you don't know the
[25:52] difference, you need to be in an altar.
[25:54] Amen. Amen. One more time. If you don't
[25:57] know the difference, you need to be in
[25:58] the altar. All right.
[26:01] Sorry, that's strong, but that's true.
[26:03] We got to know that. We know that. We
[26:05] know in this day and hour where we
[26:06] stand. Our position is where God put us.
[26:09] But you got to believe that. Amen. All
[26:12] right. Amen. Amen. So the sister is fine
[26:16] going to a church that that preaches a
[26:19] truth. But if the man knows the man's
[26:22] not preaching the truth and he goes
[26:23] there anyway, he's in trouble.
[26:26] And he's doubly in trouble because he's
[26:28] bringing his wife with him. He needs to
[26:31] say, "Honey, you stay over there. I'm
[26:33] going over here where this truth is."
[26:35] See, that way what we're going to read
[26:36] now is be careful because if he says
[26:40] this, the man right here says you've got
[26:42] to go with me. But if that's not the
[26:44] truth, she can come over here and Christ
[26:47] becomes her head. She goes to where the
[26:49] word is. Amen. Is that agreed? Amen.
[26:53] Let's listen. God is still a her ruler
[26:55] above man. This is my comment. Be
[26:59] careful how you men use this role of
[27:00] ruler. Without Christ in our heart, this
[27:03] headship role can be misused and even
[27:05] abusive.
[27:07] Men should do nothing harmful or
[27:09] hurtful. Do not be a dictator. Right?
[27:12] Remember, the woman is required to be
[27:14] under subjection to the husband as long
[27:17] as he does not go against God's word.
[27:20] Right. That's important. As long as he
[27:23] does not go against God's word. All
[27:26] right. Quote number 14,
[27:29] please. Questions and answers. Brother
[27:31] Brandon, the Bible tells us that a a
[27:34] wife should obey her husband. I'm a
[27:36] Christian and my husband is a sinner. He
[27:38] persecutes me in every way that he can.
[27:40] and for me not to go to church and read
[27:42] my Bible and denies the word. What
[27:44] should I do? What should you do? Now
[27:46] listen, you're supposed to obey your
[27:48] husband. He's setting it in order. Yeah.
[27:50] He can't say any different than what the
[27:52] word says. He can't say any different
[27:54] what God's already said. But watch what
[27:56] he does, Brother Brown. Watch what he
[27:58] does. What should you do? Now listen,
[28:00] you're supposed to obey your husband.
[28:02] That's the word. Yeah. No stipulations.
[28:05] You're supposed to obey your husband.
[28:08] Now, if he tells you and refuses you to
[28:11] read the Bible, go to church or
[28:13] something like that, you don't have to
[28:15] obey that, right? Mhm. You've come from
[28:18] here to here. He's still your husband.
[28:21] He's still your ruler. You decided to
[28:23] marry the guy or the girl, right? Why
[28:27] didn't you give me a hands on that?
[28:28] Yeah. But you did. You're stuck with
[28:30] them.
[28:32] Supposed to be.
[28:34] Okay. Now, if he tells you and refuses
[28:36] to read the Bible, go to church or
[28:37] something like that, you don't have to
[28:39] obey
[28:40] that because he that will won't forsake
[28:43] father, mother, he's quoting scripture.
[28:45] Remember Jesus said, "Who will do this?"
[28:48] Who will forsake father, mother,
[28:51] husband, wife, or whatever it is, and
[28:52] follow me is not worthy of mine. Brother
[28:55] Claude made a statement other time, the
[28:56] other day. We were reading this right
[28:57] here or quote just like it. He said,
[28:59] "You know, Brother Brandon can
[29:01] paraphrase scripture and everybody don't
[29:02] have a problem with it. But you can
[29:04] paraphrase a quote." Yeah. And they'll
[29:06] crucify you. Yeah. But brother can
[29:09] paraphrase scripture, you know. But you
[29:12] paraphrase a quote, anybody, they'll
[29:14] crucify you. I mean, geez. Come on,
[29:17] people. Good grief. We got to be the
[29:19] quote. Amen. Now, look. No, don't. a man
[29:23] or supposed you're not a man's not
[29:24] supposed to use that authority over a
[29:26] woman just because he's her ruler.
[29:29] Right. Amen. God is her ruler above you,
[29:32] brethren. See, and if your wife is doing
[29:34] something wrong, then don't then you got
[29:36] a right to tell her she's supposed to
[29:39] listen to
[29:40] you. But you haven't got no right to
[29:42] beat her or drag her around or do those
[29:44] things. No, sir. You see, God made man a
[29:47] helpmate, not a doormat. Right?
[29:49] Remember, she's your sweetheart. See, he
[29:52] she she should always be that, right?
[29:55] Watch. He never wavers to what the
[29:57] scripture says. Amen.
[29:59] But he brings and shows that if if if
[30:02] that man is right here, you're supposed
[30:04] to obey your husband.
[30:07] That's the word, right?
[30:10] But now here comes the greatest part.
[30:13] Now, if he tells you and refuses you,
[30:15] you move over here and Christ is your
[30:17] head. Right. That's right. Now, that
[30:20] doesn't say you can't divorce him. You
[30:22] can, but you got to live single. I mean,
[30:23] he can divorce you, but you can't
[30:24] divorce him. Women, we'll get into that.
[30:27] We're not going to get in marriage and
[30:27] divorce. But remember, he can put you
[30:29] away for doing certain things. But you
[30:31] can never put a man away. Right? All
[30:33] right. You can separate from him or
[30:35] whatever you want to do, but you cannot
[30:36] divorce. Right? Amen. A female cannot
[30:38] divorce. Right? Hey, guys, how are we
[30:41] going to divorce the creator? Right?
[30:44] Yeah. Amen. How do you divorce something
[30:46] greater than you? Right? You can't do
[30:49] that. Right. But but men, we can divorce
[30:53] our wives if they don't, you know, if
[30:55] they do wrong things like fornication
[30:57] and and adultery and stuff like that.
[30:59] You can't put away and marry another one
[31:00] if if she just don't uh, you know, go to
[31:03] church with you. I don't think you can
[31:05] do that. Pray with her. Be with her. I
[31:07] mean, just be a I don't know. Be a
[31:11] husband. Thank you.
[31:13] Oh, I
[31:15] forgot. Brother Al gave me something
[31:17] between services. Him and sister Anna
[31:19] didn't make it to church, so he gave me
[31:21] some rocks to throw at
[31:26] him. Robbie, you better
[31:30] duck. You know what? At least he's
[31:32] honest. He said, "We set our clock
[31:34] wrong." He said, "Here, throw them at
[31:36] me." He gave me some stones to throw.
[31:39] But look, I that Well, that's what I was
[31:41] thinking about. Don't throw stones at
[31:42] her because like daddy said, Jesus could
[31:45] could throw the first stone because he
[31:47] was without sin. But he didn't see what
[31:50] happened. He wasn't a witness. Right?
[31:52] The Old Testament said you had to be a
[31:53] witness. You had to visually see it. All
[31:56] right. But now you take it over in a
[31:57] spiritual though and you see though if
[31:59] you even look on a woman to lust after
[32:01] in your mind, heart, then you've already
[32:04] done it. Therefore, you can cast a
[32:06] stone. Yeah,
[32:08] you can. You got to have somewhere
[32:10] that's right. Right. Right. Jesus was
[32:13] right. He was just going by the Old
[32:14] Testament scripture when the prostitute
[32:15] came, you know, and they throw her down.
[32:17] But he said, "Who who has no sin cast
[32:19] the first stone?" We got to come to a
[32:22] place. We got to come to a place that we
[32:24] can cast a stone. Exactly. The stone's
[32:26] got to be cast at somebody. Right.
[32:29] Somebody asked me one time, said, "Well,
[32:30] you know, they stone people in the Old
[32:31] Testament." And I was telling them how
[32:33] the Old Testament was compared to the
[32:34] New Testament because we were trying to
[32:36] explain something about the woman's
[32:37] dress and all that.
[32:39] And he said, "Well, the Old Testament,"
[32:41] he said, "It kind of changed." He said,
[32:42] "Where you got stoning now in the New,
[32:45] you know, now like now today?" I said,
[32:47] "Don't worry. The Bible says over in
[32:50] Revelation that stones would fall,
[32:53] right? That's right. As big as 90 lbs."
[32:56] And I said, "There's your stoning."
[32:58] God's just waiting and giving us grace,
[33:00] right, to get forgiveness before the
[33:02] stones do start falling. Cuz he's fixing
[33:04] to stone this world. He's going to send
[33:06] some stones down on the world.
[33:08] But remember, you and I are going to be
[33:10] gone. So, we don't have to worry about
[33:12] that. All right. Now, go to quote 15.
[33:15] This one's a good
[33:16] one. Questions and answers. But Paul
[33:20] said that as long as a unbelieving
[33:22] husband has an unbelieving or a
[33:23] believing wife or so forth, let the
[33:25] believing wife remain with the believing
[33:28] husband as long as it's not contrary now
[33:31] to God. If he's pleased to dwell with
[33:33] her, go ahead, honey. If you want to go
[33:35] to church, that's right. But I ain't
[33:36] going to go. I don't believe in it.
[33:38] Don't have nothing to do with it. But
[33:39] you go ahead. That's all right. But when
[33:41] he says you can't do it now, there's a
[33:44] different thing, right? You're not bound
[33:47] to that. Then you separate everything
[33:49] for God. Glory. So there's your I mean
[33:52] that's the whole thing right there,
[33:53] right? You're bound to him. He can say,
[33:56] "Honey, you go right ahead." But when he
[33:59] says you can't do it, there's the
[34:02] difference, right? He said there's a
[34:04] different thing. What's the thing?
[34:06] headship, right? It's a different
[34:08] headship. You're bound not bound to
[34:10] that. So, you're not bound under the
[34:12] headship of your husband. You're bound.
[34:14] It says you separate everything for God.
[34:16] So, God becomes your head or Christ
[34:18] becomes your head. All right. All right.
[34:21] Now, as Christ is the head of the
[34:23] church, let's go to Ephesians 5. For the
[34:27] husband is the head of the wife, even as
[34:30] Christ is the head of the church, and he
[34:32] is the savior of the Bible. We read this
[34:33] before, but let's look at it again. For
[34:35] the husband is the head of the wife,
[34:37] even as Christ is head of the church,
[34:39] and he is the savior of the body. Amen.
[34:43] All right. Now,
[34:45] look, the man's leadership, this is not
[34:47] I didn't put this up here, but I just
[34:48] wrote this in. The man's leadership is
[34:51] to be as Christ leads his bride. Glory.
[34:54] Christ headship is
[34:55] sacrificial and as a servant. Amen. We
[34:59] got this thing all twisted up. All
[35:00] right, we got this thing all twisted up.
[35:02] All right. You say, "Hey, ship, put
[35:04] somebody on that pedestal and worship
[35:06] them."
[35:09] The man's leadership is to be as Christ
[35:11] leads the bride. How did he lead the
[35:13] bride? He gave his life for us.
[35:15] He was very sacrificial. Right? And he
[35:18] was in service for who? The people that
[35:21] were there. Not all of them. For you and
[35:25] I. Glory. All right. Christ's headship
[35:27] is sacrificial. And as a servant,
[35:30] listen. pure in motive and love.
[35:33] Remember I said motive and objective.
[35:35] When Jesus came to the earth, he had a
[35:37] motive and an objective to get a bride
[35:40] and to form her into his image. Right.
[35:43] Right. All right. That's what he came
[35:44] for. So same way, look at me and you. 1
[35:47] Peter
[35:49] 3:7. Likewise, you husbands dwell with
[35:52] them who your wives according to
[35:54] knowledge. In other words, just like
[35:56] that. That's what I said. Know what your
[35:59] leadership role is. know what your
[36:01] position is. Amen. Giving honor unto
[36:04] your wife. There's no better thing than
[36:07] than salvation. We'll read it in a
[36:09] minute. That that God give you except
[36:11] your wife. As unto the weaker vessel and
[36:14] as in being heirs together of the grace
[36:17] of light. Truly, folks, that your
[36:20] prayers be not hindered. Cuz I believe
[36:22] our prayers are being hindered by
[36:23] certain things that we do. All right.
[36:25] the male or the husband must understand
[36:29] the woman's weaknesses
[36:32] and dwell according to knowledge of that
[36:34] weakness
[36:37] going into this whole thing if you're a
[36:39] Christian see going into this whole
[36:41] thing God knew we would be the weaker
[36:43] vessel cuz we have sin right right so
[36:47] God knows that and he made provision for
[36:49] that he didn't kick his wife out
[36:53] did he No. If he did, he kicks me and
[36:57] you out. That's right.
[37:03] God can't destroy me and you because of
[37:05] Christ. Right. Right. Amen. Right. Just
[37:08] like Abraham and Sarah. Exactly. Just
[37:11] like Adam and Eve. God cannot destroy
[37:14] you because he sees Christ. And that
[37:17] ain't two people. He sees the position
[37:20] that Christ had. He sees the blood. He
[37:23] has to see that because if not, we're
[37:25] all guilty, right?
[37:28] So, we must understand a woman's
[37:30] weakness and dwell with that weakness.
[37:33] We know it's there. We're going to dwell
[37:35] with it. But we're going to do it
[37:37] according to knowledge, according to
[37:39] understanding that she's a weaker
[37:41] vessel. Understanding. Listen to quote
[37:43] number
[37:46] 16. Christ praises his own Ephesians. He
[37:49] talks about I know thy works and thy
[37:51] labor and thy patience and how thou cast
[37:54] not bear them which are evil. Thou hast
[37:56] tried them which say they are apostles
[37:57] and are not and hast found them liars
[37:59] and hath borne and hath patience and for
[38:02] my name's sake hath labored and has not
[38:04] fainted. How beautifully the savior
[38:06] praises and commends his children. He
[38:09] takes full account of their fine
[38:10] spiritual attitude and behavior. Let's
[38:13] plug in husband cuz he's talking about
[38:16] the bride in the church or I mean Christ
[38:17] in the church. But you men, this is what
[38:20] you the women should be saying. Watch.
[38:23] He takes full account of their fine
[38:25] spiritual attitude and behavior. He
[38:27] knows that there is weakness among them.
[38:30] Christ knows that. But as yet he does
[38:33] not cry out against it. Isn't that just
[38:36] like the Lord? He knows how to encourage
[38:38] us in the right matters and discourage
[38:40] us in the wrong matters. We could all
[38:43] learn a good lesson right here in
[38:44] running the church and our family. Amen.
[38:46] And better still, we can all learn a
[38:48] good lesson in that God deals with each
[38:50] one of us in exactly this way. Exactly
[38:54] this way. Don't ever be discouraged,
[38:56] saint of God. For God is not ungracious
[38:58] to forget your labors of love. Whatever
[39:01] we do, even giving a cup of cold water
[39:03] to someone, has a reward and blessing
[39:07] from the Lord. Amen. So, I love that
[39:09] when I saw that, that was so neat
[39:11] because you're Christ knows our
[39:13] weakness. So, we must know that the
[39:14] female is going to be the wicker vessel.
[39:16] Yeah. She's going to be trapped into
[39:18] things. She's going to be She's going to
[39:21] be wrong sometimes. Oh, Lord, that hurt.
[39:24] Sister's grown. Yeah. But the men are
[39:27] too, right? We're the weaker vessel
[39:30] toward God. Right. Right. Exactly. We
[39:33] got to
[39:35] we we got to answer to God. Amen. You
[39:39] got to answer women to wives to us. No,
[39:44] cuz we got to answer for you. Right.
[39:48] Right. We got to answer for your act. We
[39:50] got to answer for your action. You don't
[39:53] ever have to stand for my
[39:54] action. Right. June doesn't have to
[39:57] stand for my action. But I got to stand
[39:59] for what she does. Same way with what
[40:02] Christ
[40:02] did. Christ came and stood for our
[40:06] stupidity. Glory to God. For our sins.
[40:09] He stood for our mistake. Right? He
[40:12] stood for all those things for us. So
[40:14] how are we supposed to do with our
[40:16] spouse? Same way.
[40:19] If not, if we call down judgment, guess
[40:21] what God does? He calls down judgment.
[40:25] As you love your wife, so you supposed
[40:27] to love Christ or Christ loved you
[40:29] unconditionally. Anyway, all right.
[40:31] Let's go to
[40:32] uh let's go back to the next. I think
[40:35] it's 1 Peter 3:7. Likewise, you
[40:37] husbands, dwell with them according to
[40:39] knowledge. We're going to keep reading
[40:42] this accord. Dwell with them. Dwell
[40:45] means to live, be there. You don't dwell
[40:48] in a motel.
[40:50] You dwell in a house and that's where
[40:52] your spouse is. All right? You dwell
[40:55] with them according to knowledge. Other
[40:56] words, what I'm saying is it's not like
[40:58] a motel where you go in, you find one,
[40:59] you get you another, you go in, you get
[41:01] you another. No, the world does that.
[41:03] No, you dwell with this. It's to death
[41:04] do we part. dwell with them according to
[41:07] knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as
[41:10] unto the weaker vessel, as being hes
[41:12] together of the grace of life.
[41:16] I want to live with my life, my wife for
[41:18] an eternity. Amen. You don't want to
[41:20] live with yours for an eternity. I don't
[41:26] know. I don't know,
[41:28] guys. Sometimes we get oursel in messes
[41:31] and we got to get oursel out. But
[41:34] come on, people.
[41:38] I'd like to go back and start over
[41:40] again, but it wouldn't be me. Same way
[41:42] with you. Wouldn't be you. Exactly. I
[41:44] would love to live pure and and been
[41:46] just a, you know, like a a priest or a
[41:49] monk. But you know what? That ain't me.
[41:50] That ain't what that's what that's not
[41:52] what God wanted either.
[41:54] He wants you to be you. Be an
[41:56] individual. All right. Let's go
[41:59] to We're at honor and respect there. Go
[42:01] to Proverbs
[42:03] 31. Who can find a virtuous woman for
[42:07] her prices far above rubies? A virtuous
[42:10] woman. A woman full of virtue. That's
[42:13] not just being a virgin. That's being a
[42:15] virtuous woman. Amen. A woman that has
[42:18] her virtue with her for her price is far
[42:20] above rubies. Proverbs 12:4. A virtuous
[42:24] woman is a
[42:26] crown. I want you to pay attention to
[42:28] this a minute.
[42:32] This just struck me just now.
[42:35] Where is the crown and where is she?
[42:37] Yeah. All right. Right. A virtuous woman
[42:41] is a crown to her husband. Right. Yeah.
[42:45] But she that maketh a shame is what? As
[42:48] rottness in his bones. But a virtuous
[42:51] woman is right up here. Yeah. Crown
[42:55] honor.
[42:57] Because you honor your husband, he is to
[43:00] what? Bring you up. What does Christ do?
[43:04] Leave us down? He didn't leave us alone?
[43:06] Oh, right. No, he wants us to come up to
[43:08] where?
[43:10] Right here. He don't want us to stay
[43:12] down here. He wants us to come here, up,
[43:15] raise us up, sitting in heavenly places.
[43:18] But a virtuous woman is a crown to her
[43:20] husband. In other words, it has a
[43:22] crowning effect. I've seen some women
[43:23] that crowned a couple of men a couple of
[43:25] times, but
[43:27] It wasn't like that. But I'm going to
[43:28] tell you something. Honestly, I saw a
[43:30] woman. I never seen a man or woman fight
[43:32] before until I was in Gainesville not
[43:33] too long ago. About a year, yeah, a year
[43:36] or so ago. We were coming in town,
[43:38] stopped at the traffic light, and they
[43:40] were in this big like Cadillac. In other
[43:42] words, the the back window was this big.
[43:45] And he was on this side, and she was on
[43:46] that side, and there wasn't a lot of
[43:48] room in between. I'm not going to tell
[43:49] you anything about that, but they were
[43:51] rather big. And anyway, they stopped
[43:53] this and I just saw him, you know, and
[43:55] I'm behind him, right behind him, and
[43:56] they're going like this. I see
[43:59] the and she and he he takes his hand, he
[44:03] goes and he hits her in the face and old
[44:06] head flopped over like that. And I
[44:07] thought, man, if you do that one more
[44:09] time, I'm either going to dial 911 or
[44:11] I'm going to get out of the car and I'm
[44:12] going to find out what's going on. But
[44:14] buddy, it didn't take two seconds. When
[44:16] she got her wits about her, she come
[44:18] with both hands. Buddy, she was beating
[44:21] that poor old boy. And I thought, man, I
[44:22] need to come and help
[44:24] you. But that's a true story because,
[44:27] man, she she took her, she was laying
[44:29] like this, you know, she's sitting like
[44:30] this and he hit her and she did like
[44:31] that and she hit him upside the head and
[44:33] his whole head went out the window
[44:34] almost. And I thought, "No, she don't
[44:37] need any help. You doing just
[44:41] fine." But see, that's the world. We see
[44:44] it all the time. Y'all see it. We see it
[44:46] all the time. You just work with case
[44:48] workers and and worked with people in
[44:50] the world that it's an ungodly thing
[44:52] what men and women do to both to each
[44:54] other. The worst fight I ever saw was
[44:57] between two women cuz baby, they'll pull
[44:59] the hair, they'll take their
[45:00] fingernails, and they'll try to poke
[45:02] your eyeballs out. But see, that's the
[45:04] bad part. But what about coming over to
[45:07] the virtuous part, the clean part? The
[45:10] part where where if we do have a little
[45:12] argument, it's not going to laugh and
[45:14] I'm going to end up like that. I hope.
[45:18] No, it's going to be done with what?
[45:21] Meekness and fear. Just like we were
[45:22] talking about with the fear of the Lord
[45:24] that we pray and we sit down and talk to
[45:26] our spouse. A virtuous woman is a crown
[45:28] to her husband, but she that maketh
[45:30] ashamed is rottness in his bones. All
[45:33] right, let's go to number quote number
[45:37] 17. So, but now a good woman is a jewel
[45:41] in a man's crown. She should be honored.
[45:43] My see my she my mother's a woman my
[45:46] wife is and they're lovely and I've got
[45:48] thousands of Christian sisters who I
[45:50] highly respect but if they can respect
[45:52] what God made them see but if if they
[45:55] can respect what God made them Yeah. See
[45:58] there's your respect but your respect is
[46:01] right here as being the weaker vessel.
[46:04] Your respect is being the the mother or
[46:07] a real queen. The respect of what God
[46:10] made them a motherhood and a real queen.
[46:12] That's all right. She's one of the best
[46:14] things that God could give a man was a
[46:16] wife. Besides salvation, a wife is the
[46:18] best thing if she is a good wife. But if
[46:22] she isn't, Solomon said, "A good woman
[46:23] is a jewel in a man's crown, but an
[46:25] orary one or no good one is water in his
[46:27] blood." And that's right. It's the worst
[46:29] thing can happen. So a good woman, if
[46:31] you've got a good wife, brother, you
[46:33] ought to respect her with the highest.
[46:36] Not a doormat, floor mat.
[46:39] Uh-uh. Amen. No. help me. Somebody that
[46:43] helps you or enhances you. That's right.
[46:47] You should do that. A real woman. And
[46:48] children, if you've got a real mother
[46:50] that stays home and tries to take care
[46:51] of you, keep your clothes clean, send
[46:53] you to school, teach you about Jesus,
[46:55] you should honor that sweet old mother
[46:56] with all that's in you. You should
[46:58] respect that woman. Yes, sir. Because
[47:00] she's a real
[47:03] mother. Honor and respect. Yeah. So what
[47:07] we're doing now is is we still see the
[47:10] headship the way it is between husband
[47:12] and wife, right? She's a weaker vessel.
[47:14] But what are we what are we just
[47:16] reading? How that man and God is taking
[47:18] the woman through the scripture and
[47:20] pulling her
[47:22] up to a position closer, right? Crown,
[47:27] jewels, all those things. If if you got
[47:30] a good one, then you're not going to
[47:34] look down on her and say, "Hey, you're
[47:35] you're dogm." Yeah. You're not going to
[47:37] look down and say, "Hey, you know, first
[47:39] one thing another like we've learned in
[47:41] the message that um the woman's just to
[47:44] be barefoot and pregnant and shut up and
[47:46] all that stuff." That's that ain't got a
[47:49] place in and I mean you can take that in
[47:51] the modern world or, you know, even
[47:55] here. A woman's not supposed to teach or
[47:58] preach in the church in the here. Yeah.
[48:02] Amen. But you live your life so much
[48:04] that what we were talking about in first
[48:05] Peter, you live your life without saying
[48:09] a word, you can condemn more people than
[48:12] we can ever condemn behind this pullpit.
[48:14] Right. Right. Exactly. That's right.
[48:16] That's right. Just by walking through
[48:18] Walmart, right? Just by walking through
[48:20] your daily life, you condemn every devil
[48:22] that passes by you. you condemn every
[48:24] one of them cuz they're going to turn
[48:26] one day and say, "Well, well, we didn't
[48:27] see you, Lord. We didn't see what you
[48:29] were talking about." He's going to take
[48:30] and turn that TV screen on and he's
[48:33] going to show your sisters walking by,
[48:35] right? And it's going to show that they
[48:37] thought in their mind, "What in the
[48:38] world kind of dress is that?" Well, you
[48:41] know what? That's a walking Bible.
[48:43] Bible. Yeah. That's the walking Bible,
[48:45] right? Walking right by. Exactly. Right.
[48:49] Now, as men should be the same way. We
[48:51] just don't do it outwardly like the
[48:53] scriptures say. But in
[48:55] conversation, we'll get into that. In
[48:58] conversation, we're to change people.
[49:00] Amen. Conversation. M man m man m man m
[49:02] man m man m man m man m man m man m man
[49:02] matter of conversation. All right. One
[49:05] toward another. Now look, go back to 1
[49:07] Peter
[49:09] 3:7. Let's look at being hes together
[49:12] cuz that's part of the scripture.
[49:13] Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them
[49:15] according to knowledge, giving honor
[49:17] unto the wife.
[49:20] You know,
[49:24] truly if a if a a wife is in her
[49:27] position and a and a husband is in his
[49:30] position, you don't have to remind each
[49:33] other every day that that's the position
[49:36] you're in. Right. Right.
[49:39] If you got to remind that person there's
[49:41] something wrong with you first,
[49:44] there's something wrong with you first.
[49:46] Right.
[49:47] You got to remind each other every day.
[49:49] Hey, you remember you read that
[49:51] scripture. I didn't put that up on the,
[49:54] you know, I could have put that in the
[49:55] kitchen where June could see it every
[49:56] day. Yeah.
[50:01] No, I want that or try to, right? I want
[50:05] that right there. I don't need that to
[50:08] be posted, you know, above the the
[50:10] kitchen uh table there where my wife can
[50:14] read it. No.
[50:17] She knows the scripture. She knows that
[50:19] scripture anyway, but we put it up there
[50:21] enough, talked about it
[50:23] enough. But dwell with him according to
[50:26] knowledge, giving honor unto the wife,
[50:29] right? As unto the weaker vessel, and as
[50:31] being hes together of the grace of life,
[50:35] that your prayers be not hindered. Let's
[50:37] go to Romans 8 cuz the Bible talks about
[50:41] us being hes and joint airs. Well, let's
[50:43] look. Let's look at this part. The
[50:45] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[50:46] spirit that we are the children of
[50:49] God. 17. Did you not put 17 on
[50:52] there? You missed one. There you go. And
[50:56] if children then
[50:58] hes of God. Now, it's not
[51:00] differentiating male from female here,
[51:02] right? Talking about all Christians,
[51:05] right? All this is the adoption.
[51:07] Remember the first stage of adoption
[51:08] when we're born again. And if children
[51:10] then hes of God and women, y'all don't
[51:13] get as much as we do.
[51:15] That's not what this says.
[51:18] Nope. It says joint hes, right? Equal.
[51:22] Amen. With Christ. If so be that we
[51:24] suffer with him that we may be what?
[51:27] Glorified together. That's you and your
[51:29] wife, right? Amen. Glorified together.
[51:32] You and your spouse, your wife. There's
[51:35] no selfishness in this. There's no
[51:37] dictatorship. Let's look at quote number
[51:39] 18.
[51:41] The problem I see I'm over here. The
[51:45] problem I see
[51:48] is a is selfishness. Right. You got
[51:51] selfishness. Yhuh. Me me me me me me me
[51:54] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[51:54] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[51:54] me me me me me me me me way.
[51:57] Y
[51:59] I thought you're supposed to honor the
[52:01] woman as the weaker vessel. Right. Honor
[52:05] the woman as the weaker vessel. Right.
[52:08] It didn't say honor me. No, but in that
[52:10] scripture, it says between the lines, if
[52:13] you'll honor her, you'll get honor back.
[52:16] Amen. Right. Exactly. All
[52:18] right. Oh, I'm sorry. I misqued the
[52:20] scripture. No, I read between the lines.
[52:23] That's a revelation. Paul said it's a
[52:25] mystery. Yeah. A woman should what? Be
[52:28] subjected to a man. And you women that
[52:31] take another man in your arms, you've
[52:32] marred the mold that you were taken
[52:34] from. Remember that. When you act like a
[52:36] man, you're out of your place. And when
[52:38] man begin to get too and babying
[52:41] and this and that and the other. What?
[52:42] Uh-uh. Me w Give me my
[52:45] bottle. He's out of his place. He's the
[52:48] boss. He's the ruler. Not now. I don't
[52:52] mean a floor mat. I just said a ruler, a
[52:54] helpmate. Not to kick the women around.
[52:57] They're not. But the Bible says God said
[52:59] in creation, you shall rule. He you
[53:01] shall rule over you. Not to be a boss,
[53:04] but to be a helpmate. Part of you. She's
[53:07] sweet and kind and
[53:09] tender. All right, that's what we're
[53:10] knowing about this weakness, right?
[53:13] She's meek, sweet, kind, and tender. You
[53:16] should lead her around sweetly. Amen.
[53:20] Because she's part of you. Glory. Cuz
[53:22] remember folks, like we said several
[53:24] services before, you hurt her or she
[53:27] hurts you. Remember, Brother Ram said
[53:29] your heart was like a ball of oil. And
[53:32] when you ever crack that, it'll heal
[53:33] back, but there'll always be a scar
[53:35] there. So don't ever don't ever fuss and
[53:38] fight. You should lead her around
[53:39] sweetly because she's part of you. You
[53:42] go to mistreating her, then you're
[53:44] mistreating yourself. Amen. And a man
[53:48] mentally right won't do that. Right.
[53:50] Right. A man mentally right won't do
[53:53] that. You won't what? Mistreat yourself.
[53:56] Right. Amen. Why? Cuz you love yourself.
[54:01] But you're supposed to love her as you
[54:04] love yourself, right? But not be
[54:08] selfish. Selfish is a bad thing that
[54:12] goes on. I read it to you before in the
[54:14] first part of this when we started that
[54:17] that when you get two together. When you
[54:20] start doing the I I, me, me thing, it
[54:22] starts going separate. Separation.
[54:28] When you get down to
[54:30] it, just like I said, and we'll leave
[54:33] read it in just a
[54:35] minute, it's living for others. Yeah,
[54:38] that's right. Right. It's you living for
[54:41] your wife. Amen.
[54:45] You living for your wife.
[54:49] I'll read it to you in just a
[54:50] second. Now, let's go to Hebrews 13:7.
[54:54] [Music]
[54:56] How are we going to
[54:57] rule? Just by what James Dawson did or
[55:01] what so and so and so and so said. No, I
[55:04] think we ought to take the scripture.
[55:07] Remember them which have the rule over
[55:08] you who have spoken unto you the what?
[55:12] Word of God. Whose faith
[55:15] follow considering the end of their
[55:17] conversation. What's the next scripture?
[55:20] Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same
[55:22] yesterday, today, and forever. Our head
[55:26] right is Jesus Christ. But remember them
[55:28] which have the rule over
[55:30] you. Men, you remember who have the rule
[55:33] over you. Sisters, remember who you have
[55:34] the who has the rule over you. Who have
[55:37] spoken unto you the word of God. There's
[55:39] the key. That's how you rule. Right?
[55:43] Whose faith follows. In other words, we
[55:45] got to get the word of God right. Right.
[55:47] Whose faith follows considering the end
[55:49] of their conversation. In other words,
[55:51] considering the end of your life, right?
[55:55] Not just one conversation, right? Your
[55:58] whole
[55:59] conversation. Consider the end of their
[56:01] conversation. Jesus Christ the same
[56:03] yesterday, today, and forever. Let's
[56:04] look at number 19.
[56:07] Quote. I really appreciate brother Joe
[56:09] and him doing this and it's going to be
[56:11] on there for you to pull off, right? Um
[56:14] that so you don't have to look for all
[56:15] these quotes. But man, I give them the
[56:17] quotes in all different orders and they
[56:18] do they sitting here and do it. I really
[56:20] appreciate them for doing it and doing
[56:22] this for me here. So, anyhow, but oh my,
[56:25] it's all right. But you little weakling
[56:26] man, I'm ashamed of you as Christian
[56:29] brothers. Well, let your wife do such a
[56:31] thing as that. He's talking about
[56:32] cutting hair and painting the face cuz
[56:34] he's he's preaching on painting face
[56:36] Jezebel that will let your wife do such
[56:38] a thing as that. It shows that you what
[56:40] you're made out of. That's right. Now,
[56:42] women, you ought to say amen after
[56:44] fussing at you like that cuz he's the
[56:46] ruler. That's right. And the way he let
[56:48] you
[56:49] live, it's his fault. Yeah.
[56:53] God's going to hold him responsible for
[56:56] it. That's right. If you ain't man
[56:57] enough to take up and put your own house
[56:59] in order, God be merciful to you. I'm
[57:01] reading a quote from the prophet. This
[57:03] is not my words. That's right. Cuz the
[57:05] Bible said in the very beginning that he
[57:07] shall rule over thee. Now, she's not a
[57:09] doormat now. She's your sweetheart. See,
[57:12] but you should sit down. Look, listen to
[57:14] this. You should sit down and talk to
[57:17] her. It don't say scream at her. Talk to
[57:21] her. Reason it with her and tell her and
[57:26] read the Bible and pray together. These
[57:29] things wouldn't be in the church then if
[57:31] you done that.
[57:33] All right. He's talking about the pain
[57:34] in the face Jezebel sitting in front of
[57:35] you is who he's talking about down
[57:38] wherever he was preaching today. All
[57:40] right. Now, let's go to number
[57:45] 20. Questions and answers. And you who
[57:48] claim to be a son of God, where's your
[57:50] principles? If a woman ain't out of her
[57:52] place, if the woman ain't out of her
[57:54] place, aren't you a son of
[57:56] God? Aren't you the one that's a higher
[57:58] stronger vessel? As the Bible says,
[58:01] she's weaker. Then, if she's weaker,
[58:03] then show yourself a man of God. Tell
[58:06] her, say, "Sister, you're in the wrong."
[58:08] That's right. I've done it and other
[58:09] Christians has done it and you'll always
[58:12] do it as long as you're a Christian. But
[58:14] show yourself.
[58:17] In other words, show yourself first.
[58:19] Yeah. Don't live a hound dog life and
[58:21] expect your wife to respect you. You're
[58:25] a son of God. You have more power over
[58:28] yourself than the woman does. If she is
[58:32] weaker, recognize her to be weaker.
[58:36] understand her mistakes and things like
[58:39] that and try to correct her. Say,
[58:41] "Sister, we are Christians. Shouldn't do
[58:44] that." See, be a real man. Be a son of
[58:46] God and watch the women. He's talking
[58:48] about the fall. He said, "If you're a
[58:49] son of God, be strong. Be a real man. If
[58:52] you're not that way, stay at the altar
[58:55] altar until you become that and shun the
[58:58] very appearance right of evil." All
[59:01] right, that's ruling by the word. Now,
[59:03] let's go into the next one. a servant
[59:06] leader. This is where it gets good cuz
[59:09] this is bringing down. I just got a few
[59:10] more quotes left and then we're going to
[59:13] make a few comments. A wood, I'll go
[59:16] ahead and make this announcement.
[59:17] Musicians need to stay
[59:20] uh after the service to practice with
[59:22] Sister Rachel and the children. They're
[59:24] going to sing a song um for the
[59:26] fellowship meeting. And then also uh
[59:28] brother Joe and and myself and brother
[59:31] Bob and sister Aster and and brother
[59:34] Richard are going to practice a song
[59:35] too. So if you musicians would stay just
[59:38] for a little while longer. All right.
[59:40] But we're not going to be long on this.
[59:41] A servant leader living for others.
[59:43] Ephesians 5. Husbands love your wife
[59:46] even as Christ also loved the church and
[59:49] what gave himself for it. Right?
[59:53] Who wouldn't give your life for your
[59:55] natural wife?
[1:00:01] And a man say, "Amen." Amen. Jeez. Come
[1:00:04] on, people. Amen. I give my life for my
[1:00:07] wife in a second. Split second. That
[1:00:11] wasn't hard for me to to
[1:00:14] realize. Let's go to Philippians
[1:00:20] 2. Now listen to
[1:00:22] this. Let nothing be done through strife
[1:00:25] or vain glory, but in loneliness of
[1:00:28] mind, let each esteem other better than
[1:00:32] themselves. Look not every man on his
[1:00:35] own things, but every man also in the
[1:00:37] things of others. In other words, be a
[1:00:39] steward, be a leader.
[1:00:42] Let this mind be in you which was also
[1:00:44] in Christ Jesus. Who being in the form
[1:00:47] of God, thought it not robbery to be
[1:00:49] equal with God, but made he made himself
[1:00:52] of no reputation, and took upon him the
[1:00:55] form of a what? Servant. And was made in
[1:00:58] the likeness of men. Amen. Servant. Look
[1:01:01] at that. Let's read that. Leave that up
[1:01:02] there a second. Let nothing be done
[1:01:04] through strive for vain glory. and
[1:01:06] loneliness of mind. Loneliness of
[1:01:09] mine. Let each esteem other better than
[1:01:13] themselves. Cuz see, I know my wife's
[1:01:16] position. She knows her position, but I
[1:01:19] don't. You say, "Well, you know your
[1:01:21] position. You're not going to say
[1:01:22] nothing." No, you give them some
[1:01:24] accolades. You tell them esteem them
[1:01:26] better than my own self. I'd rather give
[1:01:28] her the the the best and me have the
[1:01:30] best. I've seen people in the message,
[1:01:32] they walk around with $300 suits and the
[1:01:34] wife look like they cut it out of a um
[1:01:37] flower sack. Wait, what? Flower sack.
[1:01:39] Flower sack. I was going to say a rice
[1:01:41] bag, but a flower sack. The same thing.
[1:01:43] I mean, I've seen it. I've seen women,
[1:01:45] you know, that walk around in the
[1:01:46] message like this, all beat down. No.
[1:01:49] Are we supposed to be beat down
[1:01:50] according to Christ? I thought we
[1:01:53] supposed to be happy. That's right. Full
[1:01:55] happy. Amen. Look not every man on his
[1:01:58] own things, but in other words, take
[1:01:59] care of things. take care of people, but
[1:02:02] every man also the things of others.
[1:02:04] That's not being busy bodies, and that's
[1:02:05] not gossiping.
[1:02:08] Let's let every man on let look not
[1:02:10] every man on his own things, but every
[1:02:12] man also on the things of others. In
[1:02:13] other words, you're being a servant.
[1:02:17] Let this mind be in you. Boy, look where
[1:02:19] they stuck that scripture right in the
[1:02:20] middle of all that. Right? Let this mind
[1:02:22] be in you. What? The mind that says all
[1:02:24] this, right? The mind that says all
[1:02:27] this, who being in the form of God,
[1:02:29] thought not robbery to be equal with
[1:02:31] God. Hello, that's you and I also. But
[1:02:33] made himself of no reputation, took upon
[1:02:35] the form of a servant, and was made in
[1:02:37] the likeness of men. Money, women, and
[1:02:39] popularity, guys, we know that's what's
[1:02:41] the killer for us, right? Yeah. Money,
[1:02:43] women, and popularity. What is
[1:02:45] popularity? Putting yourself way up
[1:02:47] here, right? Not good, huh?
[1:02:51] It's like they said in the scripture,
[1:02:53] don't come in and sit on the front row.
[1:02:57] But sit on the back row and let God put
[1:02:59] you on the front row. Okay.
[1:03:02] But that's true. That's what scripture
[1:03:04] says, right? Don't I mean, in other
[1:03:05] words, don't come in and, you know, like
[1:03:07] Daddy said, you know, come in and say,
[1:03:08] "I'm the preacher. I don't want no
[1:03:10] smoking section." Yeah. No.
[1:03:13] Uh-uh. Sometimes I don't even like the
[1:03:16] word preacher. Yeah. Right. I just don't
[1:03:18] I I don't You know, you get introduced
[1:03:22] as a minister and sometimes I cringe.
[1:03:24] Not because of the life I live, but what
[1:03:26] they think of what other preachers do.
[1:03:29] Cuz they just lump you all in one in the
[1:03:30] world. They say you're a preacher. You
[1:03:32] know, it's what the what they said about
[1:03:34] the money makers in the world. All
[1:03:35] starts with
[1:03:36] peas. Prostitutes, preachers, and what's
[1:03:39] the other one? And politicians. Yeah.
[1:03:43] And Yeah. So, let's get away from that.
[1:03:46] Yeah. Let's just be servants.
[1:03:49] I'm here to serve you. You know, dad
[1:03:51] many times he stayed in his study and
[1:03:54] studied and didn't come out and play
[1:03:56] ball with us. He he sacrificed a lot of
[1:03:58] things. I don't mind that now. I didn't
[1:04:00] like it then, but I didn't I don't mind
[1:04:01] it now. I don't because you know what he
[1:04:04] was doing? I didn't see his purpose
[1:04:05] behind it. I didn't. But his purpose and
[1:04:09] motive was to what? Feed you. Cuz you
[1:04:11] were the ones that was listening to him.
[1:04:13] All right. Same way with each one of us.
[1:04:16] It's a sacrifice. You say, "Well,
[1:04:18] preacher, man, he don't have to do
[1:04:19] anything. and he can get up when he want
[1:04:21] to on Monday and it it's a lot more to
[1:04:24] it than that. But let me tell you
[1:04:25] something. Just doing these two services
[1:04:26] on Sunday, it's a killer to
[1:04:29] me. It's tough. Real tough. And I'm
[1:04:32] tired on Sunday
[1:04:34] night. Real tired on Sunday night. But a
[1:04:38] servant leader living for others. Don't
[1:04:39] go to 21. Quote number
[1:04:42] 21. That day on Calvary. He was just one
[1:04:45] man, the perfect man. He gave his life
[1:04:47] and he made an example for you. Now what
[1:04:49] must we do? Now the first thing I want
[1:04:51] to say is Jesus never lived for himself.
[1:04:55] His life was spent for others. That's
[1:04:57] perfectly eternal life. Amen. When you
[1:05:01] say you go to church and you do good
[1:05:03] things, that's fine. But when you live
[1:05:05] your life to yourself, you have an
[1:05:07] eternal life. Eternal life is living for
[1:05:10] others. Amen. It proved it when it come
[1:05:13] to the lamb of God. He lived and had
[1:05:16] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:05:18] himself. He lived for others. And you
[1:05:22] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:05:24] day. What? That day on Calvary. That
[1:05:25] what happened to Calvary. And you don't
[1:05:28] live for yourself no more. Why? Cuz
[1:05:29] you're dead.
[1:05:31] You're dead. You live for others. Right.
[1:05:34] Right. Someone said, "How can you stand
[1:05:37] and let anybody call you such bad names?
[1:05:39] You don't live for yourself. You live
[1:05:41] for others that you might redeem that
[1:05:43] man. You become sons. And the trouble of
[1:05:45] it is the church has forgotten they were
[1:05:47] sons. You are sons. You're taking
[1:05:49] Christ's place. You are sons. So don't
[1:05:52] live for yourself. Live for others.
[1:05:54] Well, brother
[1:05:55] Brandham, I can live for this brother
[1:05:57] because he's sure a nice guy. Oh yeah.
[1:06:00] That's not it. Living for that man who
[1:06:02] hates you. Live for that person who'd
[1:06:05] kill you if they could. That's what they
[1:06:08] done to him, right? They killed him and
[1:06:10] he died that he might save them. That's
[1:06:13] eternal life. When you get that's in
[1:06:15] your bosom, you're facing heaven then.
[1:06:17] But you sacrifice your own things, give
[1:06:19] them up like sheep gives it wool, you
[1:06:21] look on towards Calvary. Now take that
[1:06:23] aspect or what's going on and apply it
[1:06:26] to your life with your wife and even
[1:06:28] your children. We're not going to get
[1:06:29] into the children part, but even just to
[1:06:31] your wife, you're supposed to do these
[1:06:33] things. All right, let's go to the next
[1:06:37] one. Influence. And we as Christians
[1:06:40] should always watch what we do and what
[1:06:43] we say that we're perfectly honest to
[1:06:45] every man. And you if you can't be
[1:06:47] honest with your fellow man, you
[1:06:48] certainly won't be honest with God. So
[1:06:50] how we serve God is we serve each other.
[1:06:54] Right? As honest as I would be with you,
[1:06:56] that's as honest as I'll be with God.
[1:06:58] And that's the same way with you to me.
[1:07:00] You must be honest with each other in
[1:07:02] all of our dealing. So that covers
[1:07:04] everything, right? Just like I talked
[1:07:06] about this morning about the monies and
[1:07:08] all that stuff. You got to be what?
[1:07:09] Honest with each other in all your
[1:07:12] dealing. No crooked deals. How many
[1:07:15] times, brother, I'm talking about people
[1:07:16] making crooked deals and somebody is
[1:07:18] watching you, right? Yep. And you may
[1:07:20] not think that, but there is eyes
[1:07:24] watching you and your life is
[1:07:26] influencing somebody. Maybe it's a
[1:07:29] little child and that child could grow
[1:07:31] up and be another Finny or Moody or so
[1:07:34] forth. We don't know. But your life is
[1:07:36] influencing someone. And the first
[1:07:39] person it should influence is your wife,
[1:07:41] right? Cuz she's the closest thing to
[1:07:44] you. All right? Is that true? Say amen.
[1:07:47] Amen. All right. Let's go to 1
[1:07:48] Corinthians 7. But he that is married
[1:07:51] carth for the things that are of the
[1:07:53] world, how he may please his wife. Now,
[1:07:55] I stuck this one in because you can read
[1:07:56] in Corinthians, Paul said, if you can
[1:07:59] who if you live single, then you care
[1:08:01] for the for the Lord. And it would be
[1:08:03] good to do that. But we're not made for
[1:08:05] that, right? He said, "If you can stay
[1:08:07] that way." Paul did, but most people
[1:08:11] couldn't, right? Cuz it's better to
[1:08:13] marry than to burn. I'll continue and
[1:08:15] continue on. But he that is married care
[1:08:16] for the things that are in the world,
[1:08:17] not the world. But the things to help
[1:08:20] please his wife. In other words, spend
[1:08:22] some attention to her. He gives his wife
[1:08:24] some attention. But look, you say,
[1:08:25] "Well, that's taking away tension
[1:08:27] attention from God." Is it? If your
[1:08:30] wife's a godly woman and you're helping
[1:08:32] her, even if she's not a godly woman, if
[1:08:34] you're trying to help her,
[1:08:36] you're not denying God, right? You're
[1:08:38] not you're not it's not worthless.
[1:08:42] You're trying to what? Portray God to
[1:08:44] the person.
[1:08:46] Not how he may please his wife and her
[1:08:48] be. No, he wants his wife to have the
[1:08:51] good things. He He's a servant. He wants
[1:08:53] his wife to have good things. You ought
[1:08:55] to always want your wife to have good
[1:08:57] things. Amen. Deuteronomy
[1:09:00] 24:5. When a man hath taken a new wife,
[1:09:03] I like this one. He shall not go out to
[1:09:06] war, neither shall he be charged with
[1:09:08] any business. That's right. But he shall
[1:09:10] be free for a home one year, and shall
[1:09:13] cheer up his wife, which he has taken.
[1:09:16] Now, according to some sisters that
[1:09:20] their wife, I mean, that their husband
[1:09:21] has retired, nobody in this
[1:09:23] church. That's not true.
[1:09:28] cuz she's about ready to kill
[1:09:29] him. But you know, you live apart, you
[1:09:32] go and do your, you know, you go to work
[1:09:34] for 40 years or 30 years and the sisters
[1:09:38] that live at home, the house is real
[1:09:39] quiet.
[1:09:41] You don't have to do anything. If you
[1:09:43] want to stay in bed till 10, 11:00, no
[1:09:46] problem. But buddy, let me that used to
[1:09:49] get up at 5 or 6:00 in the morning,
[1:09:51] sometimes 4:30. Let me retire.
[1:09:54] Jim's not sleeping until 10 11:00. She's
[1:09:57] getting up with
[1:09:58] me. And the house won't be quiet. I
[1:10:01] promise you that. So there's so there's
[1:10:03] some adapting that you have to make. So
[1:10:06] some of you sisters that your husbands
[1:10:07] are getting ready to retire. Boy said he
[1:10:09] didn't want to retire in 5 years. And
[1:10:10] that's a wonderful thing to do. Um just
[1:10:13] happy as a lark for him. But you know
[1:10:15] what? Janet is going to have to learn to
[1:10:17] put up with you.
[1:10:19] But if you take a whole year off, you
[1:10:20] can cheer each other up. Right. But now,
[1:10:23] how you going to fund that? I don't
[1:10:24] know.
[1:10:28] But that's just something to put in
[1:10:29] there. But now look, there's a meaning
[1:10:31] to this
[1:10:32] though. You know why? Because God knows
[1:10:36] that the good foundation that you start
[1:10:40] carries on through your life. So he
[1:10:42] would take his the the people in he they
[1:10:45] see they didn't have the Holy Ghost as
[1:10:47] an indwelling spirit to lead them,
[1:10:50] right? They were led by Aaron and Moses
[1:10:53] and all those what they were telling
[1:10:54] them what to do. So what God's saying
[1:10:56] he's doing said, "Hey, look, we're not
[1:10:59] going to let this guy worry about any
[1:11:00] business. We're not going to send him
[1:11:01] out to war." Yeah. We're going to let
[1:11:03] him take a year off, be with his wife,
[1:11:05] get to know her. Get to know her and and
[1:11:08] you know, possibly get together and and
[1:11:10] you know, you might have a kid within a
[1:11:11] year, but do but to cheer up his wife,
[1:11:14] which he had taken. God thought so much
[1:11:16] of that in the Old Testament, he gave
[1:11:17] him a whole year to to do it. So, see
[1:11:20] that's not I mean it's something to to
[1:11:21] laugh about, but it's really it's what
[1:11:24] God done to knowing that we're human.
[1:11:26] That's right. Knowing that that and you
[1:11:28] and I the foundation you start off with,
[1:11:31] you know, as well as I do in marriage,
[1:11:33] you start off on a rocky foundation.
[1:11:35] There's only one thing that can turn you
[1:11:37] back. That's God. That's right. That's
[1:11:39] finding God or finding him again or
[1:11:41] something. Come back to that foundation.
[1:11:44] And you know what it would be? Just it
[1:11:46] like daddy said about preaching that
[1:11:48] that that and let everybody realize you
[1:11:50] didn't have a new birth. At least you
[1:11:51] know where you at. At least you know you
[1:11:53] weren't deceived. Right? Same way with
[1:11:55] marriage. If you start off on the wrong
[1:11:57] foot, do it today. Do it tomorrow. I
[1:11:59] don't care. But get together with your
[1:12:01] wife and say, "Look, we started this
[1:12:03] thing
[1:12:04] wrong." And a lot of us did cuz we
[1:12:07] weren't born again. We weren't
[1:12:08] Christian. Had a rocky start. had a lot
[1:12:11] of things that were that that went wrong
[1:12:13] and and did a lot of things that we
[1:12:14] shouldn't have done, but come back and
[1:12:16] say,
[1:12:18] "Hey, one year, let's live for God like
[1:12:22] we've never lived for him before. Let's
[1:12:25] try and let's see how cheerful the wife
[1:12:27] and the husband is. But come together
[1:12:29] and say, "Let's pray about it. Let's
[1:12:32] just let's just clear the slate.
[1:12:34] Whatever happened back past is gone,
[1:12:37] right? Sure. Satan's going to give it to
[1:12:39] you in the brain." Sure. But that's his
[1:12:41] ground that he can play on. But he can
[1:12:43] only play, right? That's all he can do.
[1:12:46] He can only play.
[1:12:48] He cannot get in there and reside if you
[1:12:50] got the new birth. He can come and play,
[1:12:51] but he's got to leave. Right. All
[1:12:54] right. But see how cheerful y'all can
[1:12:56] live together. Some of you that are that
[1:12:57] are nearly married and some of you have
[1:12:59] been married a long time. You know,
[1:13:01] there's a good time to come and
[1:13:02] rededicate your life. And and at the end
[1:13:04] of this thing, we if daddy want to, he
[1:13:06] can ask y'all if anybody wants to redo
[1:13:08] their vows. Maybe you can all come up
[1:13:09] and redo your vows. Be fine with me cuz
[1:13:13] you and I have done it before and
[1:13:17] uh I'm happy with my wife
[1:13:21] because we got things straight 10 or 12
[1:13:22] years
[1:13:24] ago. It ain't been a bed of roses, but
[1:13:27] you know what we done? We started where
[1:13:30] we supposed to started in God. That's
[1:13:32] where we started. You can't redeem the
[1:13:35] time. You can't go back, right?
[1:13:38] But you can say,
[1:13:39] "Hey, from this day forward,
[1:13:43] honey, I'm going to live as clean to you
[1:13:45] as I can. I'm going to be the best head
[1:13:47] of this family that I can." And sisters,
[1:13:50] you turn and say, say, "I know my role
[1:13:52] now." And and and she's going to look at
[1:13:54] you and say, "Now, I know your role."
[1:13:56] Because of what I've been preaching, you
[1:13:58] should know the role that your husband
[1:13:59] has. And then you should subject
[1:14:01] yourself to that, right? If it's the
[1:14:03] right role. Okay. Amen. Amen. but living
[1:14:07] for others. Now, let's go to one more.
[1:14:10] No, two more. Nourish and
[1:14:13] cherish. Listen to Ephesians 5:28. Show
[1:14:16] all men to love their wives as their own
[1:14:18] bodies. Remember what he brother
[1:14:20] Brandham says. What you do to your wife,
[1:14:21] that's what you do to yourself. He that
[1:14:23] loveth his wife loveth
[1:14:26] himself. And that's the truth. And it's
[1:14:28] not loving yourself like
[1:14:29] some, I don't know, somebody that's uh
[1:14:33] cocky or whatever. You know, it's a
[1:14:36] circle. You love your wife, that love's
[1:14:38] going to come right back. You love your
[1:14:40] wife as you love yourself. For no man
[1:14:42] ever yet hated his own flesh, but
[1:14:44] nourisheth and cherishes it, even as the
[1:14:47] Lord did the church.
[1:14:49] Now, the word cherish. Did y'all put
[1:14:52] that on there? Y. Maybe they didn't.
[1:14:56] There. Well, they did. Cherish to
[1:15:00] treasure or value greatly. Amen. Let's
[1:15:04] go to number
[1:15:07] 23. Lifting them out of history. They go
[1:15:09] to church on Sunday morning for their
[1:15:10] religion for about 20 minutes. Mr.
[1:15:12] Pastor takes 30 minutes. He's called on
[1:15:14] the board. What is it? Home life is
[1:15:16] running out. It used to be that father
[1:15:18] and mother loved and honored and
[1:15:21] cherished one another. And when she was
[1:15:24] old and gray and wrinkled up and her
[1:15:26] poor little old face all drawed up and
[1:15:27] her glasses hanging down over her nose,
[1:15:29] Pop loved her just as much as he did
[1:15:31] when she was young and pretty. Amen.
[1:15:33] Amen. But today, I don't mean to be
[1:15:35] critical, but when she gets a little
[1:15:36] old, he just swaps her for a new model.
[1:15:39] It seems to be that way, like swapping
[1:15:41] cars or something. Seems like that that
[1:15:44] real family love don't exist anymore.
[1:15:47] Just something has happened. Home life
[1:15:49] is running out. You know why? Because
[1:15:50] it's become a selfish generation. I, I,
[1:15:53] me, me, it's all about me. Home life is
[1:15:55] running out. We don't have the old
[1:15:57] American home as we used to have it long
[1:15:58] ago. There's another thing that I would
[1:16:01] like to say that is another thing
[1:16:02] running out is friendship is running
[1:16:04] out. It don't seem like we have the
[1:16:06] friends that we used to have. And the
[1:16:08] friends that we have are not loyal
[1:16:10] friends like they used to be. It used to
[1:16:12] be I can remember when someone got sick
[1:16:13] in the neighborhood that everybody came
[1:16:15] around and they helped them with all
[1:16:16] their work and lended a hand to anything
[1:16:19] could be done. Set up with them all
[1:16:20] night at a time. And as I've often said,
[1:16:22] it's true that we hardly know the
[1:16:24] neighbor's dad until we see it in the
[1:16:25] paper. That's right. Friendship. I just
[1:16:28] kind of added that one in for a little.
[1:16:32] Nourish. We're supposed to cherish and
[1:16:35] nourish. Nourish is to nurture or you
[1:16:38] see all these things the word helps.
[1:16:40] Yeah. All these definitions is somewhere
[1:16:42] in there is the word help. What you're
[1:16:44] helping
[1:16:45] someone. Nourish or help along is to
[1:16:48] nurture or help along. Let's go to
[1:16:50] Colossians
[1:16:53] 2. and not holding the head from which
[1:16:56] all the body by joints and bands have
[1:16:58] what? Nourishment ministered and knit
[1:17:01] together increasth with the increase of
[1:17:04] God. All the body by joints and bands.
[1:17:07] What he's talking about the body having
[1:17:09] nourishment ministered and knit together
[1:17:12] increasing with the increase of God. I
[1:17:14] think a lot of times people in the
[1:17:15] message think, well, all the brothers
[1:17:16] are in the body of Christ and the
[1:17:18] sisters are just there for the ride. No,
[1:17:20] sisters, you're just as part of much of
[1:17:21] the body as the moving parts of the body
[1:17:23] as anybody is. as any as a mean male.
[1:17:26] All right. So now sec 1 Timothy 5 verse
[1:17:30] 8. But if any provide not for his own
[1:17:33] look look at
[1:17:36] this. But if any provide not for his own
[1:17:40] and especially for those of his own
[1:17:43] house, he hath denied
[1:17:47] the faith.
[1:17:49] And it's
[1:17:50] worse. You know what an infidel is?
[1:17:53] Yeah. don't believe in God. Unbeliever.
[1:17:56] He's worse than an unbeliever. But if
[1:17:59] any I'm reading scripture, but if any
[1:18:03] provideth not for his own and especially
[1:18:05] for those of his own house, he hath
[1:18:07] denied the faith and is worse than an
[1:18:10] infidel. All right. Now, what are we
[1:18:13] supposed to be? The last thing, this is
[1:18:14] this is going to, you know, kind of
[1:18:16] knock it home right here. What are we
[1:18:19] supposed to be? A watchman. Amen. That's
[1:18:22] why we're elevated to the position that
[1:18:24] we are so we can watch over
[1:18:26] you. God puts you in that position,
[1:18:30] right? If you're a husband, God put you
[1:18:32] in that position. If you're a pastor,
[1:18:35] teacher, evangelist, God put you in
[1:18:37] those positions. But a watchman, son of
[1:18:40] man, I have made thee a watchman unto
[1:18:42] the house of Israel. Therefore, hear the
[1:18:45] word at my mouth and give them warning
[1:18:49] from me. What did a watchman do? He was
[1:18:51] on the tallest tower he could see. Let's
[1:18:54] go to uh quote number 24. Listen to
[1:18:58] this. I know that poverty sming
[1:19:01] churches. There it is again. See him
[1:19:03] walking up and down in the midst of his
[1:19:04] church like a father. He is looking down
[1:19:06] upon his family. He is the head of his
[1:19:09] household. He is the provider. He is the
[1:19:13] protector. Yet he looks on at their
[1:19:15] poverty. Oh, how the untutoed believer
[1:19:18] stumbles at this. How can God bear to
[1:19:20] look upon his own in a time of need, not
[1:19:22] just stop it all, just give in and
[1:19:24] lavish everything material upon them? In
[1:19:27] other words, you hear what he's saying.
[1:19:30] They're saying the untiever says, "Why
[1:19:32] isn't God doing something?" Cuz he says,
[1:19:34] "I know the property, but he's supposed
[1:19:36] to." He said, "Well, you're looking over
[1:19:38] them upon his own in a time of need and
[1:19:40] not just stop it all."
[1:19:43] In other words, why don't you just give
[1:19:45] in and lavish everything upon them?
[1:19:47] Yeah, we'd be spoiled.
[1:19:50] We'd be a bunch of brats. Right. Right.
[1:19:52] We're supposed to grow up. Little
[1:19:54] heartache and trial. That's what makes a
[1:19:57] strong person. Right. All right. Number
[1:19:59] 25 is the last
[1:20:02] quote. Watchman, what of the night?
[1:20:04] What? The watchman. What was the duties
[1:20:06] of the watchman in the Old Testament?
[1:20:08] The watchman was the man that went up to
[1:20:10] a tower on the city way high. He was
[1:20:12] higher than all the footmen because it
[1:20:14] was his what? Position. He found his
[1:20:18] place. It was his position, right? He
[1:20:21] didn't wonder
[1:20:23] tomorrow. Now, get this. Get the
[1:20:26] application to this. He didn't wonder if
[1:20:28] he was a watchman. They put him there
[1:20:30] because of his
[1:20:32] eyes. Now, in order for this man to get
[1:20:34] up there, he must have a good, clear
[1:20:38] pair of eyes, understanding. He must
[1:20:40] have good eyes, must be alert. He must
[1:20:42] know the stars. Many qualifications had
[1:20:45] to be before he could be a correct
[1:20:47] watchman. But when he become a correct
[1:20:49] watchman, hang on just a second. Look at
[1:20:51] me. When he become a correct
[1:20:54] watchman, they didn't have to wake him
[1:20:56] up the next
[1:20:58] day and say, "Are you going to be a
[1:21:00] watchman?" No. He didn't wonder what his
[1:21:03] position was, right? Until they fired
[1:21:07] him. Let's just say in human terms,
[1:21:10] until they fired him. Yeah. He knew to
[1:21:12] get up every night, go get on the tower,
[1:21:15] look for the enemy, watch out over his
[1:21:18] people. Same way with you and I.
[1:21:20] Sometimes we shun our responsibility. We
[1:21:22] shun our position. This is why I wanted
[1:21:25] to do this so we can see the correct
[1:21:27] position. That's why I wanted this to be
[1:21:29] the last thing. And many qualifications
[1:21:31] had to be before he could be a correct
[1:21:34] watchman. And I'm afraid today that we
[1:21:37] put some watchmen in that could that
[1:21:38] can't see very far. Oh, couldn't see all
[1:21:41] this disaster that's coming to warn the
[1:21:43] people. Then unqualified, a watchman
[1:21:46] would soon have the city destroyed
[1:21:48] because the entire
[1:21:51] city depended right on that watchman.
[1:21:54] Amen.
[1:21:56] Your entire family depends on you the
[1:21:59] male. Amen. You the husband. The entire
[1:22:03] family
[1:22:04] depends upon you
[1:22:08] to be the head. So, what do we
[1:22:11] got? Just a second. Let's just if you
[1:22:13] want to look over them again, you can
[1:22:15] when the notes come up. Don't Don't put
[1:22:16] any more up. Headship is established.
[1:22:19] Number one, you got to be a leader, men.
[1:22:22] Number two, you got to be the initiator
[1:22:24] or take the
[1:22:25] initiative. Number three, you got to be
[1:22:27] able to govern your own home. Number
[1:22:30] four, you got to remember that God is
[1:22:32] still the
[1:22:33] ruler. Number five, honor and respect
[1:22:36] your spouse. Number six, rule by the
[1:22:40] word. Number seven, be a servant
[1:22:43] leader. A servant leader. Yeah, that I
[1:22:47] don't that we need to spend a whole
[1:22:48] service on that. A servant
[1:22:51] leader. Whether you're feeling good or
[1:22:55] not shouldn't have anything to do with
[1:22:57] it, right? You're the
[1:23:00] servant. and your spouse, your wife or
[1:23:03] your husband. We'll get on to the to the
[1:23:06] to the female or the wife in in a little
[1:23:09] while, but you need each other. You need
[1:23:13] support. You don't need to be beat down.
[1:23:16] This world and the devil beats you down
[1:23:18] enough. Oh yeah. So you don't need to
[1:23:20] get it from the nearest person to you
[1:23:22] besides God. Amen. Is your spouse. So
[1:23:25] you don't need it from them. You don't
[1:23:26] need it. You don't need, like I said,
[1:23:27] you don't need that little Chihuahua
[1:23:28] napping at the at the u at your ankles.
[1:23:32] That Chihuahua is not going to kill you,
[1:23:34] but he's going to aggravate the hound
[1:23:35] out of you for a long time. Amen. All
[1:23:38] right. So, let's not have that kind of
[1:23:40] an attitude. And then the last part was
[1:23:42] nourish and cherish. And the very last
[1:23:45] one is be a watchman. You've been
[1:23:49] given brothers, you've been given a
[1:23:52] position, right?
[1:23:54] And you took it when you married your
[1:23:56] spouse. Amen. You took that position and
[1:23:59] said, "I will honor and serve you." She
[1:24:01] said, "I will honor and serve you till
[1:24:03] death do us part." So, this is not some
[1:24:05] 30-year mortgage.
[1:24:08] No, that's right. This is lifetime
[1:24:11] payments.
[1:24:13] All right. This is lifetime stuff. It's
[1:24:15] the stuff we do until eternity breaks
[1:24:17] forth. And then, like brother Brandham
[1:24:19] said, remember when we said that hatred
[1:24:21] had a beginning?
[1:24:24] filio love. All that all that had a
[1:24:25] beginning, right? But when we go back to
[1:24:28] that great agape love, glory, that never
[1:24:31] had a beginning and he said it'll never
[1:24:33] have an end, right? So, we just drop
[1:24:35] down into time, have a little bit of of
[1:24:37] time down here to what? Display God.
[1:24:40] That's what we're doing. What do you
[1:24:42] think we're doing down here? We're down
[1:24:43] here to display God. To show the devil
[1:24:45] that we can live y in this world. Amen.
[1:24:49] And be a Christian. Right. Amen. I'm
[1:24:52] telling you, like I said before, let's
[1:24:55] cowboy up, man. If you're doing stuff
[1:24:57] wrong, stop it, right? Shun the very
[1:25:01] appearance of evil. Be when you walk
[1:25:04] into a room that the guy says, "Hey, I
[1:25:07] don't quite believe in your religion,
[1:25:09] but I know you're different." Amen. Cuz
[1:25:12] they're not going to see it all all of a
[1:25:13] sudden. Right? You know, it takes a
[1:25:16] little
[1:25:17] while, but what brings
[1:25:20] them is a life.
[1:25:23] It's a
[1:25:24] life. The life is what pulls. The life
[1:25:28] is what brings us to to a place to where
[1:25:31] we say, "If God can do it for that
[1:25:33] person, I know he can do it for me."
[1:25:37] Amen. If God can do it for that person,
[1:25:39] I know he can do it for me. Because
[1:25:41] God's not a respector of person. That's
[1:25:42] right.
[1:25:43] God will treat you just like he treats
[1:25:47] the next person, right? If you'll allow
[1:25:49] that to happen. Problem is, we don't
[1:25:52] allow it to happen. We get too much I,
[1:25:54] I, me, me. That's another thing, man. I
[1:25:56] want you one more time. We are a servant
[1:25:59] leader, right? We lead by example. We
[1:26:03] don't buy our way into this.
[1:26:07] Money will last only for so long. Right.
[1:26:09] Right.
[1:26:11] Gifts are good only so long. I found out
[1:26:13] one thing for sure. My wife doesn't like
[1:26:15] flowers, so I don't buy her any.
[1:26:18] Okay. Solved. I know that she don't like
[1:26:20] them. So why go buy them? I do get her.
[1:26:23] She loves
[1:26:24] chocolate. So she gets a big chocolate
[1:26:26] kiss for Valentine's Day and not a dozen
[1:26:29] roses because they what? They wither and
[1:26:30] go away. Chocolate stays with you the
[1:26:33] whole time.
[1:26:40] Praise the Lord. Anyhow, let's have a
[1:26:42] good time with the Lord. Let's stand.
[1:26:45] You love the Lord.
[1:26:49] We got to live in this human body before
[1:26:50] we get out of here. That's right. We got
[1:26:53] to respect the body that we're in and
[1:26:55] respect the body that God give you
[1:26:57] called a wife. Amen. Respect that woman.
[1:27:00] Respect that sister. Respect any sister.
[1:27:03] Brother said, "A Holy Ghost fil woman
[1:27:05] can teach you something." Glory. Right.
[1:27:07] Why? Cuz she's God made manifest in
[1:27:09] another form. She's just got her what?
[1:27:11] Position.
[1:27:13] Let's look at position. Positionally
[1:27:16] placed is what the prophet said is our
[1:27:17] problem. We're in we're in our wrong
[1:27:19] position. So, what are we going to do?
[1:27:22] Get in our right position. Right,
[1:27:24] brother D. Let's sing something. 87 red
[1:27:27] book. How much? 87. 87 in red book.
[1:27:31] Let's sing a song.
[1:27:33] We need a piano player in yours. Yeah.
[1:27:37] That's your position, sister. Sunday
[1:27:38] afternoon to be there.
[1:27:46] Amen. Amen. I want us to make a
[1:27:48] commitment. Amen. Be the watchman. Be
[1:27:51] the watchman that can see further,
[1:27:53] right? That can see danger coming before
[1:27:56] your spouse does because that's what our
[1:27:58] role in life is. That's what our role
[1:28:01] even in the gospel is. You know what our
[1:28:02] the role of a preacher in the gospel is?
[1:28:05] is to see something coming. A pastor
[1:28:07] should see something coming before it
[1:28:09] even gets in the congregation. He sees
[1:28:10] the little things and he sees that. When
[1:28:13] he does it, he cuts that thing off. He
[1:28:15] starts screaming, "Hey, we got trouble
[1:28:17] coming." What? You can see the cloud. If
[1:28:20] a cloud's coming, you see a You think,
[1:28:21] well, that's horses that And on those
[1:28:23] horses, they're not just out for a joy
[1:28:25] ride. There's somebody on that horse is
[1:28:26] doing what? Wanting to kill us. So, we
[1:28:29] send what? We send the troops out before
[1:28:31] they even come in to get into our our
[1:28:33] family and our home. So let's shine the
[1:28:36] very watchman over your
[1:28:38] house and we walk with the Lord in the
[1:28:58] way.
