needs of the people Lord and build our faith up today Lord Jesus to believe there you're still a present help in time of need and in time of trouble Lord we just ask Lord that you'll Lord help us as we study the word this morning Lord Jesus that you'll prepare our hearts Lord for the things that are laying here that we can receive it with the right attitude and the right thoughts and the right uh the right motives and everything Lord Jesus just be with us today and Lord bless our fellowship we pray in your name amen God bless you you can take your seats so uh we'll keep studying on through the Book of Job this morning I want to just uh we'll we'll call this um job's Testament of character this morning and we'll start at Job U chapter 1 verse one and it says um I didn't really give them my heads up back there so if you've got your Bible um turn to I'm I'm not plugging in I don't have any slides I'm just I'm just uh talking so we'll turn to Job chapter one and and uh and just read from the very top and it says there was a man in the land of O whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright now so so the the the writer here is kind of set in the stage of job how job was and how uh how how uh perfect his life was how well situated he was and one that Fe feared God and assu Evil and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters his substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 Yol of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East he was he was a blessed man he was doing everything right he feared God he had uh many sons and daughters he had all kinds of substance and wealth and his sons went and feasted in their houses everyone his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctify them and Rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it might be that my sons have sinned and curse God in their hearts thus did job continually so was we're trying kind of meditating on these words just think think about what kind of a person job was and we can try to align ourselves with after this pattern that job was the kind of person that he wanted to do everything right he was very concerned you can see his his children are going off eating and drinking and doing things and and he's but job's very concerned about doing things by the book and he took his position as the leader of the family seriously everything that his you know he's watching his children and his family doing and he's like if there is a eye that's not dotted or the te a tea That's not crossed I want to make sure that it is taken care of and he continually offered sacrifices just to make sure that everything was covered up that everything was taken care of I think that's the kind of person that God wants to look down and see if he that's the kind of person that God will be proud of when you go through a test to see that you're trying to do everything right he in other words he was the kind of person that understood the gravity of the situation that understood the gravity and the seriousness of sin and so he was concerned with maintaining a right standing with God now you'll find as we study these things out and go through the Book of Job you'll find out that being right with God mattered to job more than anything else you'll find out that that word integrity is what we'll look at here in a little bit longer is it's used continuously through this book of job to job being right with God mattered more than having a lot of stuff having a lot of popularity being right with God mattered more than anything else and you can see how this story is framed up that job he was ready before the trouble came now you think about this job there was no indicator that trouble was going to come everything was going good he had all the wealth and all the popularity and all the possessions and everything everything was going great he had a great reputation there was no indicator at all no prediction that trouble was coming but nevertheless job was making sure that he was ready I think that's a lesson that we can all take to heart is you know sooner or later there's going to be some kind of a Calamity or some kind of a trouble in your life and you don't want to wait until Trouble Comes to be ready maybe maybe trouble won't come until you're laying there on your deathbed maybe you've lived a nice life with maybe like these billionaires of the world and things living on their yachts and things and trouble doesn't really come until you're laying there on your deathbed and then you find out that you didn't make ready maybe trouble comes in different ways maybe maybe Trouble Comes when maybe your children uh not believing like you do or doing wrong or or maybe you got marital problems and things but you don't want to wait until the Trouble Comes to get ready and job made ready before the trouble came he was mind ful of his home his children he was aware of the gravity of the he was sincere about it and he it says he continually offered up sacrifices for his children I thought about that a lot a lot of times when I'm you know in the dead of night when you're praying for your family and you're you're wondering you know did have is there anything off kilter and you start laying those things before God you you can you can lay lay things with the same kind of Faith before God that like job did if there's anything wrong I want my home to be Sanctified I want everything to be in order I and you get so concerned just like job did if there's any kind of magazines or filth in my home I want it gone if there's anything wrong if there's if my children are looking this stuff on their computer wrong if there's anything wrong I want everything to be right and you get so concerned like job then then you're prepared when the trouble comes then you can have integrity in your heart to know that you're doing everything right or at least you're trying to do things right you're trying and so the Bible says that job was blameless and upright in other words his his his he had a solid spiritual Foundation that served as a Bedrock during all his trials he was blameless and upright and he was habitually righteous he consistently and repeatedly make sacrifices for his children of course we know that you know this is laying the the the the framework for the story that you can do everything right and still Calamity Falls you can do everything right and still bad things will happen but you want to be prepared when those things happen do like job and brother Bram said job thinking of his children he said now now per Adventure when they go out they might sin so he offered the only preparation that he knowed about was a burnt sacrifice the shedding of blood and he shed the blood of a lamb for his children making preparation if they did Sin you see it job was mindful of his children to make a preparation for their sin and mother and father if we would quit spending money on our children learning tap dancing and things like that and some kind of how to be an actor and put more time of pleading the blood of Jesus up over them and showing them love and fellowship we'd get along better the child would to teach your child oh you see what he's saying is he's let's let's put our Mo our our our all of our tensions on the things that really matter we can send our kids to to baseball camps and and all kinds of different thing activities and things and stay real busy with those kind of things but what about being busy about the things of God and preparing preparing for our the spiritual journey of life don't wait until trouble comes to start praying or to get your heart right or to clean up and get right don't wait until trouble strikes to do things right now you see much about this story of job is about doing things right doing things where you know that you're doing what the word of God says now in Job chapter 2 verse three it says the Lord said unto Satan uh he still holds fast his integrity that that the Satan saying still he holdeth fast his Integrity although thou movest well actually sorry sorry this is the Lord speaking to Satan still he holdest fast his Integrity although thou movest me against me against him to destroy him without cause he's still holding fast his integrity and in job 2:9 the question that his wife asked him is job are you still are you still going to have your integrity won't you just Curse God and die you you still have your integrity are you still everything's been taken away from you are you still going to live for according to the things that you know in your heart to be true and job 274 to5 Job saying all the while my breath is in me and this is a great confession all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit God God forbid that I should justify you he's speaking to his all his friends that have been saying all their bad things to him till I die I will not remove my Integrity from me so job is somebody that had Integrity now you know Proverbs 10:9 says whoever walks in Integrity walks securely but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out Psalm 25:21 says says may integrity and uprightness protect me because my hope Lord is in you you think what he the D the psalmus is saying there my May integrity and uprightness protect me to be able to walk in a position where you know you're doing what's right Proverbs 11:3 says the Integrity of the upright guides them but the Unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity and duplicity is dishonest Behavior that's intended to to trick somebody so you can see those two opposing thing duplicity is is is doing something tricky and integrity is walking according to the word of God walking according to your personal revelation of what it says and James 417 says if anyone then knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it it is sin for them so sin comes from you're not walking according to what you know to do which is the opposite of Integrity so what is integrity Integrity is living true to the standard you know if you know what the standard is then you can stand for it and and that's what God is looking for somebody that will stand for what they believe in no matter what no matter if they have lost all their friends if their wife is standing there cursing at them and saying W you why don't you just abandon everything if if if you've lost everything but yet you know you you'll stand for some God wants somebody to stand for something in the face of adversity and you know if you're a real Christian you're going to have to you've got to stand for something I I I we were talking the other day about my my girls they wear a dress you know to the to their they the little Chick-fil-A job and uh when you when you start the job all they got in their uniform is pants so they had to you know kind of go jump through some hoops and everything we we got to wear a dress and they stand out there and people start asking question questions and making fun and giving those strange looks and it's so strange today in today's society that that you know uh people of other religions and things don't get made fun of and you know you don't make fun of uh homosexuals and you know you're supposed to they say well we put our love around we just want to love everybody but you try to take a stand for being a Christian and you're ostracized and treated strange and you see but it's it's taking a stand you you got to this is this is what Integrity is it no matter what if somebody makes fun of your long hair or the way that you dress or the way that you look but yet you're standing for what you believe in and it doesn't matter if you like in the in the days going by if you're when they used to take the Christians out and put them on a sheet of ice in the middle of winter and make them stand there in the cold until they gave up their life or or in a prison a dank dark prison where they put them on the rack and stretch them it doesn't matter what they do to you or how much they take away you're going to take a stand for what you believe in now God wants somebody that's going to take a stand like job did and I I I think that should encourage all of us we I know we've got the young people up here this morning and I'm glad to have you but I I want to encourage you this morning to take a stand that God wants somebody to to know what they believe in and that will stand for that no matter what right and you remember that if you stand for God if you stand for God's word that God will stand for you he will back you up he'll back you up when the the hard times come it didn't look like it what job was going through but God was backing him up and God was proud of him because job had Integrity in the midst of the adversity that's right you think about how proud God was that he could say he could say to the devil do whatever you want to to this man but he ain't going to give up his faith because he knows what he believes in and he is going to have integrity no matter what you know so what Integrity Integrity is a essentially it's about being true to yourself and your standard even when it's tough even when it's rough maybe we could ask this question this morning do you what do you stand for right do you do you have do you know what you stand for are you just kind of going through life like a vapor but are you standing for something what do you stand for this morning when you go home this afternoon and do you stand for something are you just going to let anything that that you look at on the internet go in your mind are you just going to let anything that your friends tell you go through your mind and you're thinking and and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what your teachers tell you it doesn't matter what Tommy rot the world system puts in but do you stand for something do you stand for are you going to stand for something in the midst of adversity no matter what do you stand for something so here's what Integrity looks like in real life it's honesty it's owning up to your mistakes even if it means facing consequences even if it means losing everything you're going to be honest and I I'm one that believes in being on be it tell the truth if it hurts somebody's feeling if it hurts you tell the truth be honest all the time because that's what integrity means and you know Integrity is not character but it's part of it part of your character and that see that's what we want we want to have a character that God can look at and say he's acting just like I do he's acting just like his daddy and integrity is part of that Integrity is consistently your actions match your words if you preach about environmental issues you're going to make an effort to recycle and reduce waste that's a good eort a good example if you if you're if you're saying we need to do do something and you don't do it that that's not consistent and and integrity is moral courage when you see somebody getting bullied on the playground you're going to have the enough moral courage to stand up and say that ain't right or maybe you see somebody at church being bullied and you got enough moral courage about you to stand up and say that ain't right that ain't right to talk to somebody like that that ain't right to talk down to somebody like that and you got enough moral backbone that's Integrity to stand up and say well that ain't right amen Integrity is responsibility you you'll do what you'll say you'll do and that's where you know as we grow up as as young people and whatnot you you come to a place where you got a job and and maybe one day that you know you get married and a man's got to go to work and provide for his family that's Integrity you don't just sit on the couch and watch TV and and waste waste your hours away but you you're you're responsible like job was job was responsible for leading his family which is why he kept offering those sacrifices consistently he was responsible for it you know every one of us has a responsibility to God yeah mothers have a responsibility to raise up their children right and fathers have a responsibility to lead right and that's all part of integrity and integrity also is respect treating other people with dignity doesn't matter who they are or what they can do for you I like what brother Joel said when we were up there in Tennessee about how you might come across people sometimes that don't smell the way that you think that they should but yet you treat them the same way cuz we're and that's Integrity Integrity they might not look way that you think they should look they might not smell or or all those kind of things and despite all of his trials job always maned his maintained his Integrity in job 2:9 that that scripture we keep going back to his wife said unto him does thou still retain thine Integrity Curse God and die but he said thou speakest as one of the foolish women speak us what shall re now this this is this is a confession of a mature person shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil and all this did not job sin with his lips brother bram's definition of integrity he said the Integrity of our heart is to do that which is right in the sight of God according to his word you remember when Abraham told a little story about his his his his wife this is my sister and that and he took and he gave her away to that king and the and the King God spared his life he said because I know the Integrity of your heart and he he warned him because he knew the Integrity of that king's heart and the message presuming it said he said I'd like to walk into a church this is how important Integrity is he said I'd like to walk into a church I hope I get to see it before I die walk into a church sometime and walk through there and just see oh how sin couldn't even set in that church any member would have to confess it before they even got there the Holy Spirit would call it right out on the spot like that see just like see the women sitting there look like ladies see men like men really Men of Integrity Holy Ghost filled men spirit filled let just one sin be in the church anywhere the Holy Spirit call it right out he's talking about men that are filled with Integrity in the church that men that have a backbone that they are honest that they're living right and walking right and doing right and they're standing for right and they know they're doing right and that's the kind of a church that God will back up that they're doing everything right and the uncertain sound brother BR said Israel was the leading nation of the world in her days because they had re great godly men men like David like Solomon Men of Honor man of integrity men that knowed God and trusted God but one day there come a renegade Ahab a borderline believer so he asked the question and knoweth it not where is John Quincy Adams's where is our Abraham Lincoln's men of principle where is our Patrick Henry said Give me liberty or give me death where is a man that stands for what's right where is the man that's not afraid to speak out regardless the whole world is against him speak out for what's right and stand for it and die for it where is our Arnold V Von Winkle read again today where is Men of Integrity where is men with Spirit they're so wishy-washy and gommed up until they don't know where they stand now you see if you don't know what you stand for then you can't have integrity because Integrity is lining up your actions with what you stand for for so you got to stand for something now see there's there's there's a lesson for you when you when you CH young people when you're going to school what do you what do you stand for what do you believe when you're on that playground and somebody does something that you disagree with or whatever are are you just going to well oh well are you going to stand for something are you going to have a backbone God wants somebody that will stand for right no matter what right which is what Ephesians 6 says take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be be able to withstand in the evil day and having done everything everything you can do then stand stand for something let's keep reading on in the last few minutes in verse six it says now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan whence comest thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from go going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it now now as we're reading this you know s all the Satan's minions can come and he'll anoint people and you can see the same characteristics and this is how you identify Satan's at work here look look s Satan's attributes you can look and see his attributes that Satan is a RoR he he's not he he don't he's not settled he constantly going around trying to trying to find a place of rest but he's he's going to and fro trying to find fault and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that fearth God and asseth Evil then Satan answered the Lord and said do job fear God for not so right there we can see that even Satan recognized that job feared God and I if you want to know what fear in God is a good message to go back and listen to is that sermon respects that that brother Brandon preached that he he broke it down I was listening to this yesterday while I was mowing grass that you fear you fear your mama you fear the church but not fear like afraid but you're you you're in reverence you fear the ministers should fear the church because they don't want to put a stumbling block in front of the church you're you're you fear you fear your mama because you want to do what you want to not bring shame or reproach to the way that she raised you you you fear God because you're in in awe and reverence of of his power and and and and everything that all is creation and and and and the relationship between you and God and you want to do things that are right you want to do things right and that creates a a rever a fear an awe to the to a living God that's watching you and observing you you think about that that job didn't realize that all this was playing out in another dimension there was somebody watching him right Jo uh job was being watched and God was pointing at him and Satan's looking at him and Satan's examining and and you know think about this Satan knew all this stuff about job he knew that there was a HED he already knew when when s when God brought it up to Satan that there was a hedge around him that he feared God he knew all these things why cuz there was another dimension that was observing the situation right oh you think you think about that this morning there's another dimension that's watching you yes uh my wife and I were talking the other day about how when we were young you know sometimes you just get these like profound senses that God's watching you to see what you're going to do with your life and and maybe I can impress upon you this morning God wants to see he's he's watching you to see see what decisions you're going to make are you going to believe his word or are you going to accept the devil's lie look what Satan said hast thou not made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance has increased in the land but put forth thine hand now touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy my face you think about God sitting back no he won't no I I want God to be that proud of me you you think now many times we we'll lay it out God knew what was in job's heart he knows what's in your heart too he knows but you see it's got to be expressed all these Li all these lessons about faith without works is dead you can have faith but if it's not expressed it it it where's the life in it it's got to be expressed so you it's like you know you plant a seed in the ground but and and you you know it's an apple seed and it grows up a tree it you know the plant The Gardener knows it's an apple seed it's an apple tree but it's got to express the fruit and then when the fruit gets squeezed out you can grab that Apple off the tree and said this is a good apple I know this is an apple tree cuz I'm tasting of the fruit you got to you got to express and that's what God wants to see he wants to see your character he wants to see that's what this chart is on the back of the wall here your character he wants to see not just how much you know how much information you have but he wants to see that character expressed in your life and part of your character is your integrity that you stand for something that you're not you're not just floating around on on every wind of doctrine that you're standing for something that you have a backbone that you are a real believer and no matter what comes in life you're standing for something and it all comes because you fear God and you have a reverence and you have a relationship with him and your life is not just based on how much you know but a revelation of this living God that you serve and your character the fruits of your life is expressed and now other people can drink from your life and come to you like a you're a Wellspring of everlasting life a Wellspring of water and you're not a bubbling up water of toxicity of a garbage can of Filth and putrification but you're a Wellspring of life that others can drink from and and and get something from get some virtue from and we'll stop there as The Mists come forward if we truly fear God we'll be cognizant of our actions you see God wants to see God wants to see what you will do and what you'll stand for and how you will react he wants to see your character expressed your character has got to be on display you look at the seals it's got to be written on the inside and the out side it's written on the inside where you can see it but it's got to be written on the outside visible where everybody can see it amen God bless you [Applause]
