Christ which God gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by angel unto his servant John Levi record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ of all things that he saw bless it is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what what time time to understand that would have to be our top not just a time to you know do all right revelations 6 verse 9 and when he had open to feel see I saw on the order the soldier them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they help and they crowd with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true the style not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth in white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them now remember it was said unto them they were given to an end to said unto them they should get rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they work should be full field and we know that is your 144,000 of the killing an omelet should be done okay you can be seated Huey it is blessing you said oh brother Dale if we get here too late what are we going to do with our food come find somebody with a key any problems they find somebody with a key you make an open up let you go in but you should be here I'm name is shooting a full service remember I said when we start the service hear the preaching not the song service the preaching serves everybody i hope that will be understood of course it won't be some of you don't know baby then we do England you okay we'll put up a sign where you can read you got one back guard and then work too good which says to turn yourself on go a lot of you use a moment love you still run your fingers you can get compro home cleaned on and what do there is no I left it but that's your business cuz you're not going to stop anyway you keep doing it even though you're throwing up to that's what you call disobey the children but yeah yeah now we've been trying for quite a while to cover some things through the Book of Revelations to some that hasn't been here and we're having sister to Kenyan suddenly iron fellowshipping with a summary you know we don't leave anybody behind but we've been doing for quite a while a study on the Book of Revelations and running through the things that the prophet has brought unto us and we went through those things and coming up through the you know a little bit mature changes with mainly coming on up into the fifth chapter of Revelations and finding that that gives the bride of Jesus Christ that he's in glory y'all right after the rat survive alright then we drop over and the prophet of God covers from revelation 6 12 revelation you know to Revelation 661 there's to quote over to revelations 19 then he goes to 19 21 yes to Israel we go up in a rapture in Revelations for one knew the bride goes up in revelations for one called John is take it up the top of the rapture all right in doing that then we're studying about what will be after we get out of here and you say why do we need that well we need the plan of redemption amen all right then if we can see the plan of redic where israel then we can see the plan of addiction for ourselves and that's what I've encouraged you to do is to read to see a book we read to seal book not to just find where is the symbolic you know what was right a red mill bail and oh not to diss find the symbolic sin the answer but to find yourself and what God is dealing with you right in your own life from reading that seal and they will see the sure the literal things that happen will happen to israel after the ratchet all right but the spiritual condition are the leading up to that knee is happening right now like this fifth seal gym with reading the minute that the prophet said it was those kill from now Maria only we have to wear the church in that do we leave out of here all right now in doing that then we can see that their Redemption then we're pushing and we can see our Redemption we're rebel who wouldn't want to know about the plenary that was what Paul was so concerned about he said I would that I could be a castaway for my people we know God didn't make him a castaway with God opened his eyes or you can see his people and you can see as we covered in Romans earth you know this blindness has happened to Israel until the Gentile days be finished then he's don't turn back to Israel alright and their eyes will be open and it'll be a wonderful thing well why wouldn't you want to see who they are and what it is and but my point is to pick up then the things from the seals that we can see about ourselves but we went back to foresee list is arm again we're having a spiritual Armageddon right now in the battle of our minds according to you know the Prophet the greatest battle ever followed he's going on right now right here well then we can see ourselves you know we can see they overcame then we can see we can overcome right right then we saw the four-seater what death what is death it's not just dying it's not cutting somebody's head off and burying the body because that doesn't kill you that only puts you in a position some or a condition existence somewhere else nothing that way we can see and pick up from these things and see who we are you see I redemption and to be able to follow you know in that line alright well let's just make sure we don't drop off on anything I know I repeat a lot of funny but what do they say you can only retain about five percent or something of what you hear no you knew that only as the seat can endure who you know over and over doesn't bother right it should open our eyes to be able to see and then we're constantly on the internet may not be live tonight could we don't know they're still having trouble up in New York but it knocked us out do that you know I've been in New York in that condition and it's maybe still doing it now but we hope it's not because we we want everybody to hear and we want them to see all right but now think about it we're at about a group of people that the prophets will read in the minute said now this is a great controversy see they've argued over who is the editor what this is under lip seal but nobody could put it in the correct order no wonder it's so sealed of a mystery until you know it is really sealed up right I mean the Gentiles been grafted in he's a mystery run but that is spoken off but who knew that I was speaking of a fifth seal jus we said blindness in part it happened that Israel come when he didn't even understand the seals and thing but it was not his day in time alright so then it behooves us to dig into that but then see ourselves right like I tried to emphasize the other day let you see the Old Testament people and they've got place which we call paradise and they had the blood of bulls and goats they were speaking of Jesus Christ no you don't want to happen with Jesus raised that lady's right a lot of them not everybody they raised they went to a place which was paradise and taken up gnarly all right so they may have Redemption and you have like the fifth of the foolish virgins the they have a plan of redemption and they'll have to be given eternal life into our own but that's still a plan of redemption i do the blood of jesus christ because everything will be over New Testaments do the bloody Jesus cram all right now lead it in 144,000 they have their place and we found they even go into the millennial reign they have a place right now either believe would be raised up the Prophet said to give somebody for us to sleep too in the millennium and everything the gospel to Gillette means a how the place right but even when you get into the fifth seal jus you said well who is that who is this is reading off don't even run around them until the seal broke I'm ready to go for a minute he said I thought that was the early Christians that were martyred we when the seal broke he said I thought was right now so we can see uh people but what is their redemptive plan if there are people they've gotta have a Redemption around annihilation I fine right ma'am good you know how are addicting leave those foolish virgins have a redemptive plan and even to the White row but the biggest portion of the people in the world that will go to the bathroom without go to hell right right go to be an ally decoding the memory they don't have the reject you for meeeeee for them it's not applied to them all right throw the old testament people not ever is right or Jew is weak all over Israel raise the jesus readies no only the predestinated only those who have their name in the Lamb's Book of Life and it remained lead an elk Nell the how are we getting well that's what I'm trying to get you to see about the field you we know some people do we know these are not it says are sold so it's not a group of people standing there like mortal people they were one time mortal on the earth and they died I killed all right for their belief all right we get him doing that God knew what he was going dead so he blinded Israel where we could recite Leland doing that you think he's gonna throw him away no he's gonna make away hey do we just read in the Bible are that before these on earth her healed 144,000 and lame they're giving my rose but a wonderful thing we have told you of the plan of redemption or to think about the mercy and grace of Almighty God right that he would give her people my robes he turned of life that never wanted it they called for his blood be on them they crucified him yet he never turned his back on then you find Isaiah them crying out for his room you know the real is real man you remember have we brought it up run run said Israel not all Jews he said but Israel he said that's the name of redemption you see those Old Testament prophets cry out for them people that's what Paul was doing in God opened his eyes to allow him to see that his people would be saved I'm sure that was a thrill in the man's heart well why would that be a thrilling our heart maybe we have a reduction that we don't want anyone out of salma part of there's a pretty good sure thing we don't have it right that's no problem with me is any problem with you but what about people that all the others of the connection and even the Old Testament Saints they have some former connection what about a fish seals you that you don't want it you said well I brother Dale I throw the ride free moral agency okay not a problem do you if God wants to do it that way right if calls it can the thing formed say why did you for me this way you want to argue with God about his plan are you so super religious that you can figure it all out and tell god what to do i go to few scriptures brief talking about who is back there with me know what you see to see of people the mercies of Almighty God they would give those sleeping eternal life my clothes ready dingo time with him want to go maybe the next message or two I want to take them I want to take just a plan of redemption all the way through and tied together to where we can see true retention but we are the bride of Jesus Christ our redemptive plan is completed your on earth right amen even 144,000 they're gonna have to die even though the two minutes they'll have to die to be able to go to their redemptive plan are you be resurrected up and rapture yeah the two witnesses you see we don't have to do that we can stand here and enjoy our salvation and think about the mercies of Almighty God right it is extended to you and I right I man I mean what goody-goody did you do for God to say you right my brother I never did dry i didn TI that smoke little someone that was commendable but did that save you did they give the Jesus Christ down inviting that's right we've been realized salvation you take call most and they're saying Hebrew of the Hebrews a Pharisee of the Pharisees concerning the wall blameless he had a good testimony but did that save me what did he say later the thing that I thought was life I found to be dead can you knock on to that place see it's not what we're good we do it's what he done see then you said well you don't believe in living good no people cut that off you got home I'll meet you I believe in being born again and then letting him live right then Paul would say the life that I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God they're at yeah but that's why people preacher preach do's and don'ts to try to save people Jimmy words ever saved anybody I thought that our life Leo was to be an actor an outward manifestation of an inward work that's within us see it in that way you know what I drank all the trouble too I live steal a level two mom don't want them all right no problems in Oh sound we have troubles yes do you see it every day is what your prophet said go now wait a minute have we seen well argue with your profit you claim to believe we do wrong every day right but that's what I've been trying to do with this lip seals you part to find that water so really is because it says souls they were saying bloomer time so they were so they're not just bodies as i said but they were real see the soul of you as you real you the soul will live on after death somewhere could he get your soul God is the only one to keep your soul the devil can't kill soul hey you only can kill the body you can't do that let's not let's invite all right so then what are we doing trying to find ourselves in these things that has been spoken of to be able to put together our own salvation and to see what exactly taking place and see it either i put in golf drop rose who i put in coffee okay I'm healed of that but it was worried about it and they go sit on it no I'm gonna put in a cough drop then preach them fit offends you I'm sorry i'll bet you preach you get the cough drop huh but i didn't look was it somebody might want to go talking about and I didn't put a button in really clog done pretty good there Sundy buddy he had a hive of a button yeah no no I really enjoyed it had a good time with him running Jordan the message and everything he rested and then when he said in there about two or three times he's gonna get a new body I know brother clock he ain't talking about getting another one I allow no problems lil mike expect that statement he hears instance if i was and i'll come back to you it was doing I don't believe it hard now believing this Marty my new way of living in your body this body made me right not another one this one might new ok now but now look for everybody's benefit out there and the things we put on the water things I said to make sure they understand the directions were going and you know I found out a lot of things over the years and a lot of people they know all about everything but read the book ya know right we dealing that Daniel sandy wait part we found out you know a lot of people's never read the book but they know all about the 70 weeks a name they could estar you to pieces hmm but they know nothing about the book especially the drawings and we do Kim like an extra drawing that was signed as to be in that brother branham done it for a man in the cafe all right which is a church now listen I believe in the drawings and the things but if that's not revealed you know much stock my drawings you can the same well this is a difficult Coco Coco but if it's not revealed that's right now one revelation about what the prophet said it's not a he acknowledged because I believe a revelation is what it's necessary all right now who are these in Revelations five then that will be given white robes we can call the fifth of view we can call them those sightings that the Prophet answers it in the message of the fifth seal paragraph 2 18 to go ahead brother and start pulling up the quotes I know I've been on with this one over and over and over but I think it needs to be said again the graph 218 now these cannot be them souls you know what is a great controversy you look back to the topic said you notice this field still being open see the church is gone it can't be the sole under the the early church so you can't beat that so he's taking that out of the way if you would do that sometimes I love to do that I love the light things down it says this is it so whatever comes up later can't change that right if it does this is not it lean now if the Prophet is wrong about the church called up the revelations for one you know and not saying the 19-21 know like that then you we're falling to false prophet but if he's right think we don't have to worry about it honey so then we can see when he say who never to say now these cannot be themselves because the soldier of the righteous martyr and the righteous people the church the bride has done been to a cup so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the ride and watch that they are galli the rapture in the fourth chapter of Revelation they was taken up now who are these souls in the that's the next thing who are they then if they are not the early church this is Israel has to be saved as a nation all of them that are predestinated that's Israel that's in fluid sample mine you said we you know that can't be hmm see because they didn't believe it you're quoting what that same leap but then he spends a lengthy time proving about who this is no but it cannot be the bride she's done gone yep huh boy drop down the stack she's done come well I've got a quote over here this will have to fit that one now I don't believe you got a call that a quote I don't believe in the church crisis that look you know I thought my scripts relation i got scripture shoot down your scripture well now I didn't know is in a shooting match man if we got a shooting match you better not get against that man of your sunday that man is the state champion skeet shooter of Oklahoma the champion skeet shooter so he's pretty good I wouldn't want to shoot it out with him now I don't believe in shootin out with anybody I'm leaving the Word of God and I believe even fit all the way through all right so who is that that's Israel to be saved as a nation as I said I keep emphasizing that there was nobody wrote anything about this all right good.you commentators are the things little thoughts alone but even Scofield with Israel as a nation you right over to the 144,000 go he runs it into that group to be saved over a certain way honey let's see think about it the same to start with her I can't get away from that to think about it that God would would save a people and want to be safe but remember everybody won't be safe I'll Israel when we say its nose for the word of God and the testimony they held we're eating minute with the Prophet seems they were real true jews as we calling not Wall Street not all this money junk guys people had never heard a lot of them even about Jesus Christ we get there the chosen of God brother let that man that seems to do away with the blood of Jesus no because the blood of Jesus is want to pay the price for these right when they cried out lady his blood be on on us if he hadn't blinded those people they would have accepted him and you and I wouldn't have any part to do man we see truth comes out and then we under it unfolds and then we can see it hmm we're number two then this is ground down from the other but he says he's got scriptures and he goes to Romans and everything now I emphasize is right here because it brother if Paul's don't speak about Romans and somebody comes up contrary to it you deal with that scripture you call a concert at all about what he's saying the Israel is blinded look where you don't come up to your gonna face relations but is it 18 Republic city is an angel preaching the other thing letting me a cursed that's just all I got to say to anybody watch you go through the scripture brings it out and then what does it say the enterprise we brought in for the bride the blind has come to Israel for that purpose to all this rule will be saved me right now they are Israel that's under the altar watch everyone blind it for the very purpose of us being say you believe that now who glided them God God blinded his own children then the no wonder jesus standing back to cross and them Jews highly for his blood that was his own kids and he was the scripture i love that he was except the word in other words he knew what was going on right do you all taking place on knowing that those people would have gladly received and that's the reason he blinded them so they wouldn't recognize him he got it such a humble way and blinded him to it but they wouldn't receive it the scripture said they would do it and he glided was blinded Jesus pitied them even so much as he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing they were blind Paul said they were blinded for the cause for us honey left for you and I they were blinded we wouldn't have a hope me but we're the Bride of Christ he he knew what would take place I love that's what I said ray said he was the scripture he was the Word of God he knew exactly what he was doing what you think he knew then even gonna turn to the Gentiles what about the little woman that girl doubt that son or called out not sunday to have mercy on me you wouldn't listen to her because she was a Gentile but when she said my lord you reminded him of the bride he was coming after right she know what she left him for listen knowing that who are these use then number three click him look to perk up to 40 are you now remember what it was they were killed for the word of god sake not for the testimony of christ this sealed you and kill the testimony of christ did you notice that but remember the church come in also the martyrs of the church was for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus right now that's what we are we have the testimony of Jesus crap their testimony is only that they stayed with the word and they try their best and he knows that here too all right now but these didn't have the testimony of Jesus Christ for the word of God and for the testimony which they held as use and hira hated him so did Eichmann Saudi Stalin over the rest of the world that they stay true to what they believed listen in that wonderful and they kill them because they were Jews mama to hate those people too much there were God's chosen people going to the neck I got to 86 th seal and those old has been martyred now down through here real tools you use down through there they their name on the book that Leo the light right life now how does he named one a book how was your name going to look we made it my name I like down the book one of the prophets say your name goes on a book and sanctification what's he talking about we got all kind of books he said your name goat on them look as a believer he said their names went in the book because they were part of a religious order right so that's how the 50 would use name they'll enter right yeah they live the right live another I think Judaism to the doc lesser playing all the Jews right this late cert me and all the gym time and they were murdered by idling in the other honestly millions of them them during the German shot didn't kill murder them the cream later they do that they work I just because they were Jews they hated in Jews but I think the story was told that Hitler was hot you know what maybe he didn't like him do well cover you hate him what he was like the height couldn't get straightened up but you know going I don't know sort of mine go to the next I got more 54 and now watch under the altar of the breaking of these this Neil and events laying in the time between the death of Christ and the going of the church the Eichmann group and all that them true use with their names on the book now one of these days I'll get back to preach on to that part but I can see better than that one run around with the wind in the reunion and talk about our names being transferred no no grow it in my name let's look at off you probably talked about a transfer you talked about your name coming on the book is a believer in sanctification maybe we did you transfer when we received the baptism and over that goes okay maybe it was transferred that would keep all records straight that feel sealed you name one day will be transferred right right you be transferred from the book of life right as a religious order of people doing you birth for them now that's not the new birth of our times so don't confuse all of it it's just eternal life they get eternal life Lee what look what he said he'd always done I like to do these things look at number six always a lot of them sold on the I wanted to be that early Christian martyrs and some 26 sea lamprey not true I who we found out life's not when the Lord God broke that seal for us it absolutely is impossibly one they were going on to go over from the other side it was a juice it come on down through the town right right yeah you remember we got onto this mass wednesday I told you that we need to find ourselves in the plan every ditch alright what part of you is the most real attacks body spirit and soul would like a human being right the water that is the most important this year so Jesus gave his soul as a ransom for you and I his body went to the gray he's period went back to God and getting bit tilted that Pentecost in the prophet said he sent back his soul in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to fill all of the people we covered it over and over how they run around said it was the soul of Jesus that theophany of his being that went to hell it preached to those trolls in prison he then the real you that feel sealed is showing more to me than anywhere in the scripture the water so really though these were people that had been killed they were driving in a place but to show how that it shows a real soul they were still even crying out for revenge so what it citizen what would you step to lead to the vengeance of our blood season the soul is real you is what you are now I know people say vanilla women brother they'll body spirit soul makes the real you it's like I say it that's fine but then they define to me were that prophet the prophet would say that a Christian seems daily where do you see that if you're a born again Christian it cannot be if your soul is eternal right no way your soul can see in what John said it seems everybody's dead and we cannot sin with the Prophet City send every day the Bible says for the sins this is what we have so where do you see now if you're just saying I'm a unit the body spirit and soul where do you seeing that if it's in the soul you're off right no but if you sending your spirit realm of your Millie reason conscious of actions and things then you're not lost he's got a trouble your body get up sin no I just meant running what do you buy over this bloody w gotta motivate life that ain't rap tap somebody ahead put him in a coma you have a problem right you don't lust nothing did he's unconscious you see we you don't know yet never been booked and you worried about it either I'll just say it the body is dead without the spirit on it right but then you better consider instead of thank you that we're just the unit I'm used to so I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a part of you that is real amen the followers all after you die and go somewhere to remind that whether you are a Christian percenter either way a sinner has a celestial body but he's on the courage one item we're in edmonton christian hasn't stressful body under current opening right but doesn't matter than see that's what I'm trying to get you see he doesn't matter what are you talking about everybody in the world anybody they must be a soul dwelling within that body and spirit yeah and he's trying his best to get that soul to be warned again exactly what the two so people talk well rather than soul is just the nature the spirit that is not a quote i want it i want somebody to bring me that quote one quote anywhere in the message that says the soul is just the nature of the spirit you then come prophet of God said the soul is the nature of the spirit when you say just the nature of the Spirit you're making it just worth noting it has no meaning good that's why you're too so people believe in a change of a nature a conversion of nature you Cody said you so is the nature of your spirit that's all right if you get to New Bern right right remember the unclean spirit goes out of sanctification and remember your profit target that that's a very dangerous space the stays to be in his sanctification because you start becoming a religious person a good Pharisee want to go to church want to live right and do right he sitting still lost that's why we need a new verb that's why I scream at you for 40-some years if you don't have the new bird you're lost right what are you putting it on I believe the prophet let's show me where the brother Brown said that was the ending he said it was whether or not the spirit of you agrees with the word agrees means continually agree means to going to be sympathetic with it to group agrees that's why I love cannot be the evidence of the Holy Ghost although you can't do away with love because you love with your spirit and there's people out there today is talking to one a doctor the man loves going with all of this being the only ones talk about is God wonderful people right make us ascending for sale yep give it a religious Society you say they say you're saying what the word says right you make up your mind to what I'm talking about but if you make up your mind or wrong way than you'd want to do stuff not many if that person is a born again Christian he will come to this next right if you don't go to this message he ain't born again let's write it up simple language easily understood I believe in Christianity I believe you must be born again I mean you must be justified sanctified and feel with the Holy Ghost at man then you just started oh she's just a baby but screw trichology desiring the sincere milk of the word to be able to grow thereby that's why I'm trying to get you to see what is the real you do you know you're sad what you are you don't never have wrong dollars you tell me you don't tell you lie no catch any problem I just tell you I know the only person they would have wronged us would have to be somebody that was in a comatose state because according to my profit even Jesus was tempted in all points as we are and the Prophet said even tempted in women he certainly wouldn't allow it was he the war was Satan tipped in the math through the body into the spirit not in his soul that sold turned right back around city get behind me yep would you understand what I'm saying the fifth seal is the greatest portion of scriptures to show what you really are right and how salvation is involved because it's what I was describing I want to go no matter what portion of people you are there must be a form of salvation it's all paid for by the blood of Jesus crouch even though the Old Testament people all right their sin was pushed forward right to Calvary the Bible says Jesus cried out what once more all are we gonna do is exactly so they look at the fifth seal we can find do we really are great gotta do those that's what people say they're worried that I do with us I don't want me I'm sorry but you know the book of Acts Lana do this that's back under yeah genesis x is the backyard max Rome's greatest relation bc that's that counter we understand what I'm doing so you said we don't need this we don't need that dividend we know and for sure to need all applies right then we have to be borne by the Word of God and then that way we can read that Old Testament well as than you when you tell the woman's room for work pants that ain't in the New Testament hats in the old one and we ain't under that no mower I thought the Jesus come to mind if nothing on Friday man over the Old Testament Ron working for a woman in the New Testaments magnified per diem back about Trump right okay any problem hey brothers they love thank the old testament to you know at the same time they said for a woman not to work or McCain to make their a man not to wear a garment pertaining to a woman same scripture we don't want that breeze do you guys only much it guys imma felt I'm not a guy but listen why do we go through and we were covering where the prophets it this does a wedding with a doctrine people has the fifth seal revelation the doctor is so creepy he said no sold or not dead nor alive see the field seals you if they're still opening those away with that let's read a little bit on man but I'll try to get you to see who you are it'll bother me prick 10 years on once the road runs in one scripture one given one seal tie the entire Bible again who's talking about the real Carter thanks lets it run said I can take a three-leaf clover preach 25 years I believe it don't you I believe you can do me we can take a three-leaf clover to nothing with room for lease I look what he says it for 35 37 38 on them of the field seal he said I do not name but I do think really by the opening this cos i believe it's open to us I did it with good conscience with clear revelation before God not trying to just make it think because I always was against organization there were we belong to them which is open to me name and I do make another thing by the opening the fifth seal in this day straightens up and doctrine right here then I might sneak off I'm thrown treatment now believe it there's people in here that does believe that the anisole sleep I they just disprove that they're not sleeping they're alive their bodies Earth's are sleeping but the souls not in the grain there in the presence of God under the altar now even the fifth seal Jew is under the altar you can't put them in the fifth dimension because you knew that you will get it in a minute you got them with the center data so you got a problem you don't have to put them somewhere you better put them in the sixth dimension you better put all the redeemed in the sixth dimension you better put the bride in the sixth dimension because run around him when he went beyond the curtain of time yeah that's where Jesus wouldn't he said he's hired he said you can't go that right honey look the other way it was sold sleeping but brother I didn't know them about that one before you heard of this message what did you think about when you died well I really never thought about that's about as youth ball an answer it can be cuz you did think about you never wonder where you come from where you going you didn't wonder like that why am i where am I going I guess I'm the only goofball in the crowd the image but always wondered I always wanted to know about Who I am and where I come from and what I'm here for we see basics of organized religion believes the soul leaves the body no red probably say we all know what does it happen to whatever happens it just leads out everything's needed now they wouldn't talk about six dimension sold on the altar very much might have some that would endeavor to speak on it at times but basically you just go to the other day for you to hit your mouth it's like I tell you know I know I get in trouble saying it when you go to the Undertaker you look down in there and you say don't you look do it no I don't look good in the evil day I know what you're saying they got a good job fixing them up you know they look natural but other day we see the Bible says they didn't know nothing or no not see we took that as being that once I some how much we just we're gum go we never talked about getting it all back together and making a white rum we didn't know much about that we didn't want to know much about that the basics of all religion is that the soul is just you're just going when you die so the Prophet covers who it was teaching that look for 37 he said it was brother here I slid the author of Daniels revelation taught it like that the great teacher huh then he goes home down we read in a minute that the the seventh day adventist people that's what they believe you bro not when I look he said he was trying to support sold sleeping now this year I Smith and that said there is no nobody say there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven the only order spoke on that he believes is in heaven is the altar of incense now that's what the man talk need to disprove the fact that you you would be something these are but you did people not too different with my brother you said I want to immediately great teacher but it disproves the open you this sealed in the last days you just takes old sleeping prom another way see they are they're alive they're not dead right you notice this is not if there's no altar of sacrifice in heaven number of rounds proving a point run if there are no altar of sacrifice in heaven where is the sacrifice for sin lane then lamb see there have to be a place where the slain lamb bloody is letting the higher and sort of lovely his gotta be dry desert weather so sleeping so he said on the next we'll go ahead number eight questions an answer it on real to of 1954 103 evening / have 24 he said to adventist people believe that when a man dies and he goes right into the gray and stakes are so old body and everything until the resurrection and they call that so Cleveland no see that's where we ended up at now to stop inland sold sleeping he said that's not true it's in their mind you they were right out for revenge you they still have their feelings then what everything's Richie bobble if they've seen right they won't ever beat me that's what I'm saying we're not we're just not talking about eternal Christians and what it is I'm just trying to get you to see who we are man you should realize yourself what you are and what makes you motivated but pushes you what God you why are you here tonight right right Thompson guided you that there the way but everybody else was about the palace but brother Dale we want to know what we were yeah we was before the world you know I just figured you remember how about him put his hand even thought he was reincarnated no but lets the church what is this old right this is what I want to get into redemption do you realize there is no there's references to these thing but there's no soul of God mentioned in the Old Testament now come on don't go in our bed it and Rosco thirst identity and all that I'm talking about frankly the scripture they were if so was that pressure it would talk about a spirit right you would even talk about it the apne form which is even Jesus Christ Kenny dark was so Allah Almighty God is not just a body and spirit with a very soul of all money gone that's all what the hell for you and I that I don't have to go and paint my prices come up and see if he went for me then why can't you quote that scripture worse I'll not leave David he wouldn't gonna leave my soul and I don't that he made sure I didn't have to go what are you the much what the Prophet had to say on a message called faith we give this number system and the way the soul is that part of you who knows and understands your intelligence you say well neither do you really know about one of that's true well I'm glad you had it in your mind cause you remember the vision I had not long ago he's describing the soul and telling you that's working win right the vision of translation one in that place saw those people now your spirit will come back to that body and that that kind of a body the soul which is the body that does not have to eat and so forth if this earth I'm an item it is all we have one way a celestial body then with that spirit that sold a celestial body you rise up again in again this natural body for that great millennium so what is the soul it's a part of you that makes you work an animal has a intelligence but he doesn't have a soul that's the difference in him in the human being and that's why in the Old Testament the animal life could not pay them could only pay to cover the price no no soul in the animal to come back in it right there the Old Testament science amen right you only have one Jesus Christ Kenny right alright so what is it so number two 1961 1231 one serves you must be born again program 111 I'm so good or bad dad doesn't change its right I had a lot of sense what about people thinks I'm bad here but when I get to heaven defend will be alright good Catholicism nothing much word with Catholicism he said he had a lot of wrote it down we want to come Leon what is the soul what is it sold its you I'm at funny your soul the park inside of you and when you die ever watch shape that souls in that's the way it goes he goes through its destination you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you do for it that's old got to be chained here are going to give them that number 11 you don't up for 63 in the souls that are in prison now I got 36 now the soul of man is not the volume manage the soul Seether so is something that's the nature of the Spirit amen then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture finally telling us we are dead and our lives are heating God through Christ still there by the hood spirit that wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul now look de Marville a statement the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if not it's on the world accorded that to a man who told you many time in jeffersonville in the end of it was a to sole person i quoted it to him and he said well how can a nature have a nature because it was in nature and so and they saying this old is just the nature I don't know once you argue another brand for that because he said if you're born again then make sure your soul is gone if not the nature of your soul is the devil there's no in between there's no gray areas we belong to one or the other lift the necklace there are souls in prison but that's all that's in our see that soul is what God and working on the deadly not working on your body you can be annoying it on your spirit every day your life and I go to hell right let around send him in the door with him African dates in these days you go down and watch Georgia play any dates yeah we're that from your spirit to what if he can only get that nature that spirit to agree with him then that makes your died the nature of the world eyes and the things of the world is day Z because if you are the world of things of the worldly love of God is nothing the man must be born again so this money Nature has to die and the nature of God comes and lives in you and God is your mailing list never have again your needs me to an army soul is what God is working on you know working on your body's not working on your spirit we're going to be sold with use your inter meeting redemption is only in the soul you're not born again your body you're not going to get in your spirit your morning getting your soul oh that's a rearview now no matter whether you're Christian are sinner you have a place to go to and if you're a sinner you have a celestial part of you called your soul now what about something just a second to watch it but up number 16 now that they have to mention this is from 116 Twitter what I get we put my pages into the backwards okay excuse me let's go with this where we get over to the other let's go in our realm unser the same you watch your subconscious put a lie detector on a man knows whether you lighten up from water not your spirit but from the inner part of you and the subconscious laser place call the soul it is intelligent intellectual mind does not govern that vibration of the system it's done the light is only a director you will direct you it's very capable of bringing you to God no one pretends Marie incapable and bring you to the guard your mind you cannot not know God by your mind intellectual it's one of the resources are the channels that would lead you to it but your soul is what governs you you are what

in on human so random they engage them at all need some new all captain's count but it allows soon wait blow up number 15 they tried to find something chimpanzee has no soul now this is what brought it up more people listen up the next one to the human being was the serpent the Bible said that he was the most of all the lease remember the serpent he was not brought beasts of the field smarter he he almost had a soul that's what the beast was musty he almost had soap he had a place for a soul so he had any into our compartment and said what everybody wants to make this overriding the in square

Weather Center site Center our site you have a place to go to let's get this nerdy number 16 the fifth dimension this is taken from Revit stage in my ministry the field emission is worth the center young believer dies goes to the fifth dimension is kind of well a horrible dimension the following new member the prophet saw when the Christian died he goes into the sixth dimension when they hear we divide whether or not you born again we are born again you go into the sixth dimension not you under the field the soul the Celestra part of you click the next from the countdown if I would time before he is like trying to go to sleep and you can't he's describing this hideous things he said that's the snake of the weekend date you cannot go in the presence of God to go to you to Center you cannot return back to the earth goes his times up and he's caught between the two things in the fifth dimension he's got a soul and he cannot go in the presence of God because it's not covered by the blood he's a sinner he cannot wake himself up because it's time up on earth no there he is it a torn in Nightmare that's the nightmare in listener dies he's called me to go with his soul between the Earth and nail you're not marry you would no matter where your sinner or saint you got a soul in a place to go to that what's the next question the Nexus real to your office out leaving the church you look like a roll of this you're really like more the beans each one is a great conglomeration of gaiety and blackness and darkness mortals live in you now they're either influenced room this way are from that way so you know he doesn't do much north of time going up now more of in here there are either influence in this way from that way you cannot be here a spiritual being said our site without having an influence from the underworld are from the above world if your influence from here to must be pulling up no you're from above your celestial body is lighting up here but if you're wicked and hypocritical in ever your celestial body is down here okay regardless of how much you think he's up that because the fruit that you by our booth much you are no that's your inheritance no need so your soul astral body even hear of the iron her down here that's first Corinthians 15 40 by seven these narratives go ahead joel is in the 5th division I repeated this one number 19 another thing of the mission is where the center unbeliever dies and go to the field amazing not a well like a horrible world but Grayson dies he goes into the sixth inning all right now look up number 20 and what's the difference a celestial body for a center our site is the soul right right good evening are you with me this year so now that bunch of scripts are saved were to divide the difference if it's upwards of God these downwards is of the world we just read that right now we know if I heard the house of this time and that word is all we got in other words we have a built in God and the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens you don't speak of a center having a turn place but a Christian has an eternal place which is eternal life work in the soul in its own retirado said that when I would cut out a few your brother's run the when God breathed into the nostrils of Adam this is often the young blasphemous names he said Adam became a living soul he said specially don't run in especially when especially you need computer especially into Adam eternal life he had you turn life in his soul he said we had I the only died and body come on cuz I'm on it he said Adam died did he ever way died yet sacrifice he said that's why we struggle for eternal life look we're finally we struggle for it is becoming first out we need it within what you get it why would you struggle you won't struggle for it you love it it is part of you they must go through the lifestyle get through okay now run around and said while I pulling up number 22 but a random said that Jesus is sold his theophany Lee's being went to hell I proved it to you the other day they brought around beyond the curtain of time the angel of the Lord referred to that is sold under the altar and said he reserved referred to it the one it was standing there with you now that's not so go to the altar crying how long run around you to soldier on the outer 40 sometimes they're not referring to the field shields you the field shields you doesn't say sold under the altar crying how long it says souls of them that were beheaded crying when you say souls under the altar as the writer Jesus Christ those he said to one standing there with him said he said this is so company hunker never thinking that filter he said this is the scripture so your soul is you'd be apne now listen the apne is a celestial form so if you're a sinner your Diaw finish taking you down you're a celestial body of taking your name and be called it theophany the prophet will use the word but then when you're going upward your celestial has an upward pull your soul and you sold as you theophany the brother how he thought might be apne was up yonder what was Jesus its the Omni up there or was it within him come on amen I asked you a simple question that fry your soul is the Omni went to hell right so now your soul is your fiancée amen if you're born again is going upward you're not as good then you say yeah let's see brother Brown who says the Bible says is equal 18 40 sold are mine Satan cannot create a soul he perverts the nature of it cannot create we ought to get a few things settled in our mind if we're born again as we read and sold in prison you're all right you're not now watch what he says forgot to 70 to 79 on the Hebrews chapter 20 correct 7557 823 now the low cost that went out of God which was the logos all this begin to form into a body shape and this body shape was called in scholars teaching low gosh the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it with what we call it the apne the army of the human body this glorified listen not exactly what flexing blood like it will be in his glorified state well there is a form of a human body that doesn't need neither does it great but it's a body a body of is wedding for us as soon as we leave this one now iam Barry entered into that body that's that kind of body that God was when we live here going up we gonna do the body like God was where he said let us make man in our own image in our likeness worth in it Genesis someone right now when man become into that body now we didn't even come into the body that would make the lifeless he had control of the fishes and the files in the beasts of the field and then there was no man that killed us all yes it to be done late male and female but there's no man that killed soul to a major structural members right which was in the image of God which is the theophany which is also all roads are probably said we're creating before the foundation of the world you need to quote i gave it like suede go back to that tape did God make man out of the dust of the earth you gave him a hand like a like a chimpanzee did with foot like a burn he knew him he made him on the image and this earthly body is in the image of animal life and it's made out of the same kind of material your body is made just a son kind of material as a horse or a dog or anything like that it's made out of calcium nice petroleum constantly but you're just on flesh like that the same flesh it's different place now you know what he's talking about birds in one place where another / dr. no flesh come on you know what he said made out of the dust of the earth where it come from but the difference between an animal and a man God put sold in a man he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in a man is that theophany then the soul is it a mayhem vote so when God create Adam you creating first a spiritual being secondly and naturally in the net the spiritual being would put in the natural being made him ruler of the earth make them an amateur God brother I've always been taught my soul not the OP knees at the other that's where you've been taught by people and they know what to tell me about it amen show me what it Robert says is up top man you missing the scripture it says if this earthly Tabernacle question were I stents dissolved we have a body waiting nothing written good English oldest at the off your main if it goes down is this theophany if it's going up this is the often it and God never put into man plus theophany of his own being to take him down Lee what is that the off me brother branham he said gotta hold up better hands and when it's time not better eyes you said well hon I didn't know they had hives but when brother Brown went beyond the curtain of time he could see a little difficult they were beautiful women he could see and they were trying out my precious brother if you had to come you were talking to him because they were in the theophany and he wasn't there in body but body was laying open hey you stole the theophany Liz me he said I can tell you as a one person he said it like it he said I been to both places you remember when he was shot near just a kid he was the one I am yeah he said I've been to both legs he said what you don't want to come back all right now what is it folks your soul is a Sir Leicester a part of you it's a part of you that makes you serve worship God even go over the Hottentots of Africa into the jungles they never heard the name of Jesus and it works if its upright why because of the soul that is within that person is longing out for his creator and then why can't you see that what venue is crying out seasonings when you get born again God puts eternal life in you we just read said eternal in the heavens you have eternal life in your soul by the new birth through your shoulders your theophany the person of your being if you're born again is going up with because theophany means a manifestation of God or a deity so when we were sinners we had a god better known as a devil and he was in our soul amen making that so perverted but when we got born again God comes in the soul drives the devil out now our theophany is going upward we have the new birth do you see you can take the fifth seal the pricks anywhere from the man you priests read n from don't realize you can preach salvation from the fifth seal you're tied together the entire Bible to find out who we are what we're doing david knew enough to say my soul thirsteth after the oh god run run said the only thing he needed was the new birth then they said that word how about him in my heart and I'm I'm not sin against thee you needed the new murder but that animal had no life to be able to be taken out David could give this animal sacrifice it was covering but when jesus paid the price David would be able to be taken and paradise would be emptied out as the old saying he has done away with Wow because it was taken up the soul of David an umbrella resting Abraham walking around there said sarah said we got to get out of here they will recognize us know who you want to say when Abraham looked like that's not what he's talking about we're talking about they were dying to be able to walk through the walls be able to move dude if you'da seen them in some more you know something was going on if we gotta get out of here will be recognized me you see the soul will come eternal you'll never be destroyed but if it's not eternal it will have the second death which is the death of the soul as I say that moment ago when we were serving the devil he was are gone now we're serving an eternal God commun hail within us the very life of Almighty God so our shoulders are kionda the Genesis 126 man right let us make man that was a spiritual image right come on then it was put into a natural body in the garden right and Adam had eternal life leading the animals and funny you and I come in the world at a mortal being set it to death we can receive the new birth our soul becomes eternal now that spiritual image that God had at me before the world it's not caught up with me right let us make man in our only image let them not just one I believe had eternal life whether you believe it or not I did because she was assigned soul is out of my dear brother branham o'clock you wounded they were same and so a real true man and wife becomes one in Christ that's right there's only one soul that is eternal that meant that scotch on my fried that's why we must receive they never born again believer has the soul of God in the portion that we are not deliver gold is worth the one day take us off that we listening number seven in the spell book make all these signs my Oh like that cry out in your heart ha ha Oh bye what

trying to give us to see who we really are and what we're doing here probably God said when that bride begins to realize who she is and what she's doing here Satan will be powerless before her do we say but yet we don't see it hardware problem is that's where trouble is the memory region and conscious wood for the plant that was muddled up in the garden and Satan come down and perverted the mines we got to get over that get into the mind of Jesus Christ the Prophet says are in the trolls in prison a party who talked about the mind the soul the mind that was in Christ if it may never be in then
