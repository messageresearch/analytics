[8:58] has been precious to us and they think
[9:04] of you a lot in our prayers amen
[9:08] this morning I just wish to show you a
[9:15] type in the Old Testament in the book of
[9:18] Genesis chapter 37 verse 28 26 to 28 we
[9:26] talked about the story of Joseph we
[9:29] normally focus our attention on Joseph
[9:32] but today we're gonna focus our
[9:36] attention attention on his brother Judah
[9:39] because I'm going to talk about the
[9:41] transformation of Judah he was
[9:44] transformed we'll read verse 26 of
[9:49] chapter 37
[9:51] Genesis and Judah said unto his brethren
[9:56] what profit if we slay our brother and
[10:00] conceal his blood
[10:02] come let us sell him to the Ishmaelites
[10:05] and let us not let that not our hand be
[10:10] upon him for he is our brother and our
[10:13] flesh and his brethren were content and
[10:16] then there passed by million i'ts
[10:20] merchantmen and they drew and lifted up
[10:23] joseph out of the fitbit and sold joseph
[10:26] to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of
[10:28] silver and they brought joseph joseph to
[10:32] egypt but in chapter 24 the same book
[10:40] Genesis 44 I'm sorry
[10:43] Genesis 44 verse 32 this was when Joseph
[10:57] intended to detain the younger brother
[11:01] Benjamin verse 32 we read for thy
[11:10] servant became surety for the lad unto
[11:14] my father saying if I bring him not unto
[11:18] thee then I shall burden the blame for
[11:20] my father for ever
[11:22] now therefore I pray thee let thy
[11:27] servant abide instead of the land an
[11:30] abandonment bondman to my lord and let
[11:35] the lad go go up to his brethren for how
[11:39] shall I go up to my father and the lad
[11:42] be not with me lest peradventure I see
[11:47] the evil that shall come to my father
[11:50] these are the words of the Lord let's
[11:52] pray our Father we humbly come before
[11:55] you this morning and ask that you give
[11:59] us inspiration Lord send anointing both
[12:03] to the speaker and the heroes alike
[12:05] and father may give us a wonderful time
[12:08] in worship and may you extend your hand
[12:12] and reach out to the needs of the people
[12:14] for there are many we want to give you
[12:17] all the praise and honor and glory in
[12:20] the service in the name of Jesus Christ
[12:21] our Lord we pray
[12:23] I mean hey be seated
[12:33] praise the Lord
[12:35] so um I was telling better Samwell that
[12:43] this has been a long trip we will we
[12:46] would have been eight weeks away from
[12:49] home traveling around the u.s. on the
[12:52] 17th of June and or will fly out of
[12:56] Atlanta to go to New York and then on to
[13:00] Manila
[13:01] so you pray for us because we're missing
[13:04] our congregation we're missing our
[13:06] family sister chichi is missing her dogs
[13:09] so that dogs and but it's serious has
[13:16] been a wonderful journey because God we
[13:22] saw God is with us wherever we go
[13:28] amen we want you to pray for the Saints
[13:41] in the Philippines they have forecast a
[13:44] big storm a big typhoon there they say
[13:48] it's equivalent to the type typhoon
[13:53] Haiyan we had about six years ago
[13:56] um and it's kind of strike the country
[14:00] maybe late tonight or tomorrow morning
[14:02] so just be in prayer for the Saints in
[14:05] the Philippines and also I want you to
[14:08] pray for this church in Hong Kong
[14:10] because there's a lot of trouble because
[14:13] of the protests going on there this days
[14:17] because their Chinese is trying to
[14:20] change the laws in Hong Kong you know a
[14:22] Hong Kong used to be under the United
[14:26] Kingdom administration and there are the
[14:29] people they are used to living a
[14:31] democratic life and they used to be so
[14:36] free and now Beijing is trying to clamp
[14:41] down on the Hong Kong residents
[14:44] and trying to change the laws there and
[14:46] they they told the Hong Kong residents
[14:49] you have to accept the fact that you're
[14:52] now part of China you know just like all
[14:55] the other provinces of China but the
[14:58] Hong Kong people they could be they
[15:00] would not take that and now they're now
[15:02] going out on the streets and for
[15:05] protests as many as 2 million people go
[15:10] on the street to protest against the
[15:12] Chinese Chinese government well we know
[15:17] what the Prophet said about communism
[15:19] and you talked about communism China I
[15:23] believe China is the biggest communist
[15:27] country in the world now I thought for
[15:30] for a while that communism has gone down
[15:33] it's gonna fizzle out but better Bannon
[15:36] said that 3 isms will be swallowed up in
[15:40] Communists and Nazis and fascism and
[15:43] communism and we see it happening in our
[15:47] days China becoming a very influential
[15:54] nation in the world that it's considered
[15:59] no superpower one of the 10 I think they
[16:03] ranked a China now as number 3 economic
[16:08] power in the whole world
[16:10] and so we're living in trouble Stein's
[16:14] this AIDS is truly critical and so we
[16:19] think of the church in Hong Kong but the
[16:22] John Durrett was there visited the
[16:24] church in Hong Kong a while back and he
[16:27] ministered for us and they they want to
[16:32] greet you in the name of the Lord but a
[16:34] John and so remember them because the
[16:42] church in Hong Kong my church in Hong
[16:44] Kong is mostly made up of filipinas that
[16:50] migrated to Hong Kong to work as
[16:52] domestic helps so they work there and
[16:56] take a two-year contract
[16:57] and they're only able to come home once
[17:00] a year like they were given a month's
[17:05] leave in a year um to be with their
[17:08] family so you know how tough that would
[17:11] be but sisters are so faithful and the
[17:17] church is actually growing
[17:19] we presented a message to a group
[17:22] they're a little denominational group
[17:25] which is led by a Filipina sister I'm
[17:29] not this is another group it's not much
[17:31] a group it's a new group and they all
[17:34] know not all but seventeen of them
[17:37] received a message and they are now
[17:39] ready to pull away from the big
[17:41] organization so we want to thank the
[17:43] Lord for that amen so praise God going
[17:50] back to our subject Judah you know what
[17:57] could be worse than killing your own
[18:00] brother
[18:02] well Judah made this suggestion instead
[18:05] of killing him why don't we just sell
[18:08] him make a profit make money although
[18:11] our brother and that to me is worse than
[18:15] killing your brother to make money out
[18:17] of your brother but he didn't care he
[18:22] had that I would say Judah had that
[18:25] Judas spirit on him because you know he
[18:30] sold the Lord for thirty pieces of
[18:32] silver and Joseph was sold for about the
[18:34] same amount of money 20 pieces of silver
[18:38] in his time so we understand that Joseph
[18:42] typed Christ hallelujah
[18:45] but I want to show you this morning that
[18:48] Judah types you and me and every
[18:52] Christian believer that has been born
[18:54] into the body of Christ because Judah
[18:58] was a changed person after after they
[19:02] sold Joseph then probably the Lord
[19:09] started dealing with Judah
[19:11] and starting thinking about what
[19:13] happened and when it came time for the
[19:18] family to go back to a chip of course
[19:22] you know the story um I'm just cutting
[19:26] it short because we don't we don't have
[19:28] the time to go through it but they got
[19:35] food from Egypt and Joseph was
[19:39] instrumental in saving the whole family
[19:42] from this great drought and they brought
[19:47] food to the brothers the siblings of
[19:53] Joseph brought food back to Jacob and
[19:56] his family and when supply ran out then
[20:02] they went back again to get some more
[20:05] food and I'm thinking of I'm thinking of
[20:10] the message now you know there's drought
[20:14] taking place in this world not that
[20:20] there's a drought for food there's
[20:22] plenty of food but there's there's a
[20:27] drought for the understanding there's a
[20:30] drought for a true revealed word of the
[20:32] hour there's a there's a there's a
[20:37] famine going on in the whole world today
[20:40] and there's only one place where they
[20:42] can get food it's true Joseph there's
[20:47] only one place where we can get food and
[20:49] nourishment for our souls today and
[20:53] that's through the Lord Jesus Christ and
[20:55] he is the revealed word of the hour I
[20:58] mean the whole world is dying the whole
[21:02] denominational world is dying they have
[21:05] the word but they don't have the
[21:08] revelation of the word
[21:11] praise God um so we're thankful to the
[21:16] Lord that we have a an an ending supply
[21:22] that while the whole world is starving
[21:25] spiritually we are fisting every time we
[21:29] gather here every time we come to church
[21:32] you get to eat of the fresh manna
[21:35] anointed word of the hour hallelujah and
[21:40] so but Joseph's condition was that they
[21:45] had to bring the youngest brother of
[21:48] course Joseph knew that that was his
[21:51] full full-blooded brother Benjamin and
[21:56] we understand that Benjamin typed the
[21:59] 144,000 you know the last of the
[22:02] siblings that will be saved so he was
[22:06] brought with the other siblings to into
[22:10] Egypt and Joseph saw him for the first
[22:12] time and his heart was truly movement
[22:18] after he saw Benjamin and you see
[22:27] Joseph's intention was to keep Benjamin
[22:32] and rescue Benjamin so that Benjamin can
[22:35] live with him and he doesn't doesn't
[22:40] really care about the other brothers but
[22:42] he cared about Benjamin so he wanted to
[22:45] keep him and in order to do so he put of
[22:50] course that that's silver Cup in the
[22:56] sack that Benjamin took with him to take
[23:00] back to their homeland so you know the
[23:05] story he had to detain Benjamin because
[23:11] of it and now look what happened Judah
[23:16] became the hero he became the savior of
[23:22] Benjamin he was willing
[23:25] to get himself arrested so that his
[23:29] brother can be set free he said let I
[23:35] therefore I pray thee that let thy
[23:38] servant a by you can detain me make me a
[23:43] slave do whatever you want to me but set
[23:47] my brother free hallelujah instead of
[23:52] the lad a bondman to my Lord and let me
[23:55] the lad go up with his brethren or for
[23:58] how shall I go up to my father and the
[24:01] lad be not with me less fret for
[24:04] adventure I see the evil that shall come
[24:06] on my father of course he saw how how
[24:09] Jacob was hurt when he lost the first
[24:14] son he thought he lost the first song
[24:17] that was Joseph's hallelujah and and you
[24:22] know the Bible said he he mourned for
[24:25] him for days and the brothers and the
[24:28] sons and daughters they came to him and
[24:30] tried to lead all thing to try to
[24:32] comfort him but he would not be
[24:34] comforted and Judah saw this happening
[24:39] and he didn't want to be responsible for
[24:42] this to happen again to his dad huh so
[24:46] he said you need a servant you need a
[24:50] slave just take me but set this young
[24:54] lad free and let him go back to our
[24:57] Father you see now from being a goat in
[25:02] the beginning who saw this brother for
[25:05] money now he became a hero he became
[25:12] brave
[25:13] he started faith even to be a serpent
[25:17] forever even to give his own life
[25:20] hallelujah for the sake of his brother
[25:23] half-brother and you know what this was
[25:28] actually what what worked on Joseph's
[25:34] emotions when when
[25:38] Judah said this you know he's probably
[25:40] thinking you're willing to do this give
[25:43] your life for you for your half-brother
[25:45] and that was too much for Joseph and
[25:50] that's when he said you get the people
[25:52] out of here
[25:53] and he started to reveal himself to his
[25:56] brother I am Joseph your brother Amen
[26:01] hallelujah hallelujah and it struck me
[26:04] it struck me that a man can be changed
[26:08] from a coward to a hero hallelujah what
[26:14] caused the change say I believe God is
[26:18] showing us a type here that the person
[26:22] can be changed no matter how wicked how
[26:27] obscene how sinful a person has no
[26:30] matter his upbringing whatever it is you
[26:34] know his background God can change that
[26:38] person and make him a new creature
[26:40] second Corinthians chapter five it says
[26:43] if any man be in Christ behold he's a
[26:48] new creature old things pass away that's
[26:52] all your old nature amen and you become
[26:56] a new creature in Christ Jesus
[26:58] hallelujah
[26:59] and how does a person become a part of
[27:02] the body of Christ by one baptism you
[27:07] are baptized in in one body by one
[27:13] spirit baptism and so we thank the Lord
[27:17] amen for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:20] and I want you to I want you to know
[27:23] that baptism Lord ghost is still
[27:25] available for all of us
[27:27] amen today it's still the same Holy
[27:30] Ghost that was given poured out on the
[27:33] day of Pentecost we can receive it it's
[27:37] available for you today the same Holy
[27:40] Ghost that filled filled the first
[27:44] questions and when they started speaking
[27:48] in tongues and performing all kinds of
[27:50] miracles in the work of backs will be
[27:53] it's the same Holy Ghost that is present
[27:55] here and here's some available and this
[27:58] experience is a God has made it
[28:00] available for it's one of us today
[28:04] hallelujah
[28:06] see look at Judah he was selfish
[28:09] arrogant he was dishonest
[28:14] he was unloving opportunistic he was a
[28:19] greedy person think of it he was carnal
[28:23] and he was indifferent to people's
[28:26] filling his dad's building he didn't
[28:29] care about his dad's field he didn't
[28:31] care about his brother's feeling oh but
[28:36] but he he went ahead and suggested he
[28:40] brought this idea to his brethren who
[28:43] don't just kill him that let's just sell
[28:45] him we can make money out of this thing
[28:47] see how crooked he was but then he
[28:51] became selfless and he became sensitive
[28:56] and he now is now feeling for other
[28:59] people he now becomes a caring person he
[29:04] loves he's now displaying his love and
[29:07] he's caring for his family's dad and he
[29:11] he now feels responsible and he's not
[29:15] ready to give his life for his little
[29:17] brother hallelujah and because of this
[29:22] Joseph could no longer hold his feelings
[29:24] and he started revealing himself to his
[29:26] brethren hallelujah brother Branham says
[29:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost will do
[29:36] that to you
[29:38] it will transform your life hallelujah
[29:43] he said transforming he defined it I
[29:47] used to work for a public service
[29:49] company he was a lineman where he had we
[29:53] had transformers and to transform now
[29:56] the word the word means itself something
[29:59] like to transform means something that's
[30:02] been changed something that's changed
[30:04] from one thing to another
[30:07] see it doesn't mean just to repair and
[30:13] do a patch-up job you know it's it's a
[30:17] complete overhaul you become a new
[30:20] creature and then you cannot take your
[30:23] your old personality your old nature
[30:26] into the new birth hallelujah the new
[30:30] birth hallelujah gets rid of your old
[30:33] nature you completely die to yourself so
[30:38] that can Christ can can live in you
[30:41] hallelujah Romans chapter 12 verses 1 to
[30:48] 2 says I beseech you therefore brethren
[30:50] but be by the mercies of God that you
[30:54] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[30:56] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[31:01] reasonable service in our language today
[31:05] that means this means that's the least
[31:07] that you can do after you've been
[31:10] redeemed and you know Christ died for
[31:14] you he gave up his life in exchange for
[31:16] your soul now you all have this rebirth
[31:20] and this is the most that this is the
[31:22] least that you can do is to present your
[31:25] bodies a living sacrifice hallelujah
[31:29] this is your reasonable service and be
[31:33] not conformed to this world but be
[31:36] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[31:39] that you may prove what is that good and
[31:41] acceptable and perfect feel of God I
[31:45] believe that's
[31:47] most evident change that happens to a
[31:51] person during rebirth after his rebirth
[31:56] you will see less and less of that
[31:59] person and more and more of Christ you
[32:04] we get to manifest less and less of
[32:07] ourselves we become less serfs selfish
[32:13] or self you can accept Center and we
[32:18] become more and more Christ centered
[32:21] hallelujah
[32:23] the more mature we become the more
[32:24] Christ centered you becoming hallelujah
[32:30] your life is changed you become a new
[32:36] bottle for the new wine new vessels for
[32:40] this new message
[32:42] brand new message that came from God in
[32:44] our age hallelujah
[32:46] he said the new wine is put into new
[32:50] bottles the new skin had oil in it
[32:55] because it's flexible of course we
[32:59] understand that bottles then were made
[33:02] out of skin animal skin I understand it
[33:06] a little bit more when after but a Cemil
[33:10] told me how they make wine I think
[33:13] you're make having communion this
[33:15] afternoon okay so and they were having
[33:21] to make your own wine in the Philippines
[33:25] we just buy him from the grocery grocery
[33:28] store because we don't have as much
[33:33] grapes to work with but Bernice amel
[33:38] told me that when they when the wine is
[33:41] made it actually produces some certain
[33:44] kind of gases as it what you call the
[33:49] processor / ferments the fermentation
[33:53] process produces gas
[33:57] and the the the new wine expands that's
[34:01] why new bottles have to be used as
[34:04] vessels so that bourbon says the new
[34:07] skin has oil on it you can't use an old
[34:12] skin because it's dried up so when the
[34:15] when the new wine expands then the
[34:18] vessel the dried-up old skin will crack
[34:21] and it will burst you lose the the wine
[34:26] as well as the vessel but new skin has
[34:32] oil on it when mom said it's flexible
[34:35] and that's that's what we need to be
[34:39] flexible hallelujah and when the Holy
[34:43] Spirit comes down and says the baptism
[34:45] the old spirit is the same today as it
[34:47] ever was
[34:48] divine healing is the same as it ever
[34:51] was that new wine begins begins to
[34:54] spread out and the skin gives with it oh
[34:58] I like that hallelujah this word becomes
[35:03] to spread out and the skin diskin gifts
[35:07] with it
[35:07] every time the Word of God is spits in
[35:09] its power then the new skin will holler
[35:12] amen
[35:13] it will give away so you see the wisdom
[35:18] in a new bottle for a new wine alleluia
[35:22] alleluia
[35:23] you know you cannot put this message
[35:25] into a denominational bottle imagine
[35:30] putting this message in the Catholic
[35:33] Church and the priest starts preaching
[35:36] about the seals know they can do it
[35:42] they'll just burst I mean they can't
[35:45] handle this new wine but thank the Lord
[35:48] amen hallelujah that he has prepared a
[35:51] new breed of people
[35:53] [Music]
[35:54] prepare amen a new creation and the new
[36:00] creation can handle the new wine joy to
[36:02] God hallelujah praise the Lord amen
[36:06] you cannot mix this message with your
[36:08] old denominational cream all
[36:12] denomination blam national idea of
[36:16] traditions you cannot put this message
[36:19] in traditional Christianity when this
[36:23] message come to you everything becomes
[36:25] new hallelujah and you don't try to be a
[36:32] Christian no more because Amen when the
[36:37] new birth happens and you're filled with
[36:39] the Holy Spirit it automatically changes
[36:42] your life becoming christ-like becomes
[36:48] an second nature to you you don't even
[36:51] have to try
[36:52] hallelujah because if you just try to
[36:56] live a Christian life because you're a
[37:00] part of meta message Church you come to
[37:02] a message church so I must live a
[37:04] Christian life I must dress right and
[37:07] you sisters you have to grow your hair
[37:09] long not cut it very bottom said if you
[37:15] don't have the Holy Ghost and everything
[37:17] will just become legalistic to you
[37:20] Alleluia amen because you're just trying
[37:24] to make yourself do it you're trying to
[37:27] discipline yourself hallelujah but if
[37:31] the Holy Ghost come into you he does the
[37:35] disciplining amen you don't do it
[37:38] legally madam said but Amen you're happy
[37:42] to do it you do it in appreciation of
[37:46] your salvation hallelujah
[37:50] and Bertram says it's just like a
[37:53] mainspring of a club or a watch just
[38:00] like the mainspring in a famous watch
[38:02] I'll be talking about Rolex watch
[38:07] when that mainspring sets in the middle
[38:10] of the watch it controls every moment of
[38:14] that watch every moment every single
[38:17] movement of that watch and and that's
[38:20] what's the matter friends he said now I
[38:22] hope you see this I hope it's the Holy
[38:26] Spirit in the middle of your spirit the
[38:31] Bible says a new heart will I give you
[38:33] and a new spirit are given to you
[38:35] hallelujah but after you've taken on a
[38:38] new heart a new spirit from God people
[38:44] are mistaken that that's the Holy Spirit
[38:46] that's not the Holy Spirit huh but God
[38:50] said I will put my spirit in you it
[38:54] becomes the mainspring of the watch the
[38:57] mainspring of our being so that every
[39:00] move every thought everything that we do
[39:03] on this earth hallelu is now controlled
[39:05] by that main strain mainspring
[39:08] hallelujah he says you see the Holy
[39:11] Spirit is in the middle of your spirit
[39:14] it has to be in the middle of your
[39:16] spirit your thinking and that what
[39:20] spring makes all the rest of the
[39:22] movements just stick just exactly to the
[39:25] place keeping perfect time when the Holy
[39:28] Spirit is in the middle of your spirit
[39:31] it makes every action of the Holy Spirit
[39:35] in you tick tick off just exactly
[39:38] according to God's timepiece and what is
[39:41] that that's the Bible the world
[39:45] hallelujah
[39:48] see you somebody told me it's so hard to
[39:53] conform to the word it's in our day and
[39:57] age in our scientific age eighths of
[40:02] Technology it is so hard to live a
[40:05] Christian life and I told him it's not
[40:09] hard it's impossible
[40:12] impossible to leave a patient life
[40:14] without the Holy Spirit abiding in us
[40:17] hallelujah thank you Jesus so don't you
[40:21] think that you can make it without the
[40:23] Holy Spirit how we need the Holy Ghost
[40:27] to take full control of our lives
[40:30] hallelujah thank you Jesus and it
[40:34] changed them heard of em said the rising
[40:37] of the Sun he said it changed them any
[40:41] time the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:43] happens to a person it changes that
[40:45] person it quickened them it made them
[40:49] different they were made there were a
[40:53] changed people from then on it quickened
[40:57] them from an old life of being a coward
[41:01] think of it they used to be cowards -
[41:05] like the Lion of the tribe of Judah from
[41:10] cords to lie in a tribe of Judah it's
[41:14] interesting that better benin mentioned
[41:18] the tribe of judah here because the lion
[41:21] comes from the tribe of Judah
[41:23] they absolutely face martyrdom nailed to
[41:28] crosses crucified upside down
[41:31] burnt and thrown into the lines then no
[41:35] more courts courts about them that has
[41:39] no victory over them at all the dynamics
[41:43] was in the mechanics yes sir it
[41:45] quickened their mortal bodies aren't you
[41:52] glad glad that there is a promised bride
[41:55] that will come on the scene and the
[41:58] bride is not just mechanics it's not
[42:01] just tapes and books
[42:04] amen its mechanics and dynamics amen
[42:10] tapes and books the word the written
[42:14] word will cut will will bring you to
[42:18] death without the dynamics its dynamics
[42:21] its the dynamics the Holy Spirit of God
[42:24] that brings it to life this is the
[42:27] quickening power of the Holy Spirit is
[42:31] what gives you illumination about the
[42:34] Word of God hallelujah
[42:37] so brother BAM says this there's no need
[42:40] there's no use giving your car a
[42:42] civilized job young people probably
[42:46] don't understand what civilized job is
[42:48] well today in our language we call it
[42:53] Auto Detailing what what use what good
[42:59] will it do to us
[43:00] to the Auto Detail an old car rusty no
[43:06] use no use in putting a new engine on
[43:09] that old car hallelujah but even if you
[43:17] put a new engine in that car put a new
[43:20] heart so to speak in that car verbum
[43:24] says I don't care if it's a new engine
[43:26] if it's a brand new car the paint is all
[43:29] shiny up all series are you can smell
[43:33] that it's new hallelujah but it will get
[43:36] you no hair without the spark I don't
[43:40] care if it's filled with gas you put a
[43:43] full tank on it filled with gas or
[43:46] diesel hungry what without the spark of
[43:49] the Holy Ghost
[43:50] without that electricity hallelujah it
[43:53] won't run amen
[43:56] aren't you thankful that the bride aid
[43:59] system
[44:01] but we don't we don't just have the
[44:03] books and tape you don't have just have
[44:05] the the mechanics
[44:09] because everybody has the mechanics
[44:11] everybody has the table on their phones
[44:14] now Alleluia
[44:17] but even if you have the a pin on your
[44:19] phone if you don't have the mechanics
[44:21] you'll get nowhere you have you need to
[44:25] have the dynamics
[44:26] thank you Jesus hallelujah not just a
[44:30] new heart not just a new spirit but the
[44:34] Holy Spirit has to come into your news
[44:37] amen so that every move every action
[44:40] hallelujah that you make is controlled
[44:43] by the men mainspring which is the Holy
[44:45] Spirit
[44:46] so why Judah
[44:50] James is 49 verse 10 says the scepter
[44:54] that's the scepter is the is the that
[44:58] stick that the the king holds in his
[45:01] hand it's the stick of Authority the
[45:05] scepter shall not depart from Judah it
[45:08] had been prophesied that this king that
[45:11] would come will come from the lineage of
[45:14] Judah nor a lawgiver from between his
[45:19] feet until shiloh come and unto Him
[45:23] shall the gathering of the people be
[45:25] hallelujah so the Messiah was prophesied
[45:29] to come under the lineage of Judah no
[45:33] wonder it was Judah Amen that came out
[45:38] stepped out and saved Benjamin
[45:42] hallelujah he became the savior of
[45:44] Benjamin I hope you're seeing the type
[45:48] now though he was a coward at first he
[45:51] was materialistic at first he was
[45:58] selfish he was just thinking of himself
[46:00] he was the thinking of the world
[46:02] fairness of his brother at first but
[46:05] then God changed that hallelujah
[46:07] and he became he was willing to give
[46:10] give his slide to save in order to save
[46:12] his half-brother hallelujah so why did
[46:16] they have to be Judah because it was
[46:19] prophesied in the world Jesus Christ had
[46:23] to come through the lineage of Judah
[46:26] hallelujah the Savior will come from his
[46:28] lineage take me instead like Moses who
[46:35] said black my name out of the book God
[46:39] could not do it he couldn't go against
[46:42] his own program was it Moses
[46:46] it wasn't Moses it was the Christ in
[46:49] Moses hallelujah hallelujah Exodus
[46:53] chapter 32 this was when Moses asked the
[46:56] Lord to blood his name out said you know
[47:00] if thou will forgive their sin because
[47:04] it's the Israelites you know after
[47:07] having seen the hand of God move so
[47:09] mightily amongst the in the myths they
[47:13] were still stubborn they still
[47:16] complained all they do was see the
[47:19] negatives and Moses was being aggravated
[47:23] and then but he said he said this before
[47:28] God he was praying to God yet now if you
[47:31] will forgive their sin Moses interceded
[47:34] for the nation of Israel and ask God to
[47:37] forgive their sins hallelujah and if not
[47:41] if you won't forget their sin though
[47:44] don't kill him
[47:47] but me said I pray thee out of my book
[47:50] which now is written you see this was
[47:54] Christ
[47:54] in Moses hallelujah
[47:57] kill me instead take my name out of your
[48:01] book and God could not do it hallelujah
[48:04] God can never take a name that has been
[48:08] predestined ated placed there before the
[48:10] foundation of the world out of the book
[48:12] of life oh my that's how confident Moses
[48:17] was
[48:18] that's how confident Christ was that he
[48:23] would never lose a single one of them
[48:26] hallelujah every single one of those
[48:29] predestinated seed will come hallelujah
[48:32] thank you Jesus hallelujah and the Lord
[48:35] said unto Moses whosoever had seen
[48:38] against me him will I block blot out of
[48:41] my book I can't I can't change my
[48:49] program Moses I could blot your name out
[48:54] that would make me a liar if I do that
[48:59] hallelujah
[49:00] so we we know the rest of the story
[49:04] Israel is still a powerful nation up to
[49:07] this very day
[49:08] hallelujah because Moses prayed for them
[49:13] for the people that constantly
[49:15] aggravated him
[49:17] this was Bertram says in this quotation
[49:22] said I remember one time a man named
[49:24] Moses and those people constantly he
[49:29] would we would call it in our southern
[49:31] southern expression I didn't know this
[49:32] was a southern expression aggravated him
[49:40] they continually aggravated him just
[49:44] constantly kept him on the move
[49:47] everything was a murmur or a complain
[49:51] and so forth but Moses but when it come
[49:56] to the showdown when God said separate
[49:59] yourself from them because I'm going to
[50:02] take you and start a nation oh my
[50:07] sometimes as a pastor I felt like Moses
[50:13] I felt like this is just forgetting it
[50:17] and turn my back on my congregation all
[50:19] they give me was problem and just start
[50:22] another word don't you feel like doing
[50:26] that sometimes by the same Oh
[50:28] start another word start the new name
[50:32] nation I'll give you a new nation
[50:34] hallelujah huh because I'm going to take
[50:40] you and start the nation and Moses
[50:43] throws himself in the path of God's
[50:45] wrath oh my said take me and not the
[50:50] people this is the pastor's heart this
[50:55] is the pastor in Moses not these people
[51:02] hallelujah that he called them rebels in
[51:09] rebellion against God and against him
[51:11] yet he loved him so much
[51:14] till he said take me and save them if
[51:23] you don't have if you run out of things
[51:25] to pray for pray for us pastors pray for
[51:31] by the Dale you know it's been on this
[51:35] stuff for many many years now and you
[51:38] don't know the heartache the pain you
[51:42] know the trouble that you know people
[51:44] gave him when they start to criticize
[51:46] and complain and murmur you know say bad
[51:51] things about him we were just you know
[51:54] in a church where some people were
[51:58] spreading some lies about brother Dale
[52:04] you pray for us pray for your pastor
[52:08] love him support him the best that you
[52:10] know how hallelujah Jesus Christ was a
[52:21] lamb a priest when he told when he when
[52:26] you took the sealed book I mean knows
[52:28] that only the lamb was worthy to take
[52:32] the close book speaks of his first
[52:37] coming he was a lamb first
[52:41] when it took the closed-book hallelujah
[52:54] but then he became a lion and so the
[53:01] lion is the one who cried and seven
[53:06] thunders uttered their voices and we
[53:11] understand that Bertram says the
[53:13] thunders they reveal cracks the thunders
[53:17] that's the voice of God amen that
[53:21] reveals God completely this the Ministry
[53:24] of the son of man hallelujah thank you
[53:28] Jesus
[53:32] so the revealer of the word came as a
[53:35] lion who quiet in seven thunders rode he
[53:39] is forty to take the book and open the
[53:41] seals off
[53:42] but remember the lion has prevailed the
[53:45] Bible says he was first a lamb he came
[53:48] first as a lamb and he suffered and was
[53:51] led his death in order to prevail
[53:54] prevailed Bertram says means to overcome
[53:58] you see he had to come as a lamb first
[54:02] in the first coming hallelujah
[54:06] and then he became king when he comes
[54:10] again the second time and second Timothy
[54:15] chapter 2 verse walk just would like to
[54:17] hear it if we suffer we shall also reign
[54:22] with him if we deny him he also will
[54:27] deny us you all want to reign with
[54:33] Christ for a thousand years here on
[54:35] earth hallelujah and I'm looking forward
[54:38] to that day but first you need to suffer
[54:45] without suffering you cannot do it
[54:48] you know don't you think it would be
[54:53] great if just if God just give us
[54:55] character you know just like that
[54:58] we pray for character and God gives us
[55:00] character right there yeah but it
[55:03] doesn't happen that way it doesn't work
[55:05] that way character is a gift you you
[55:10] attain it through much suffering on
[55:13] earth look at the life of Joseph what he
[55:16] had to go through hallelujah first he
[55:24] had to go through suffering you know he
[55:29] had to go through the hatred and the
[55:31] jealousy of the Brethren and then he had
[55:35] to be sold to slavery and in Potiphar's
[55:39] house he was wrongly accused and was
[55:43] imprisoned for it think of it but from
[55:46] the prison God rose him up to sit on the
[55:50] throne the right hand of heaven Pharaoh
[55:54] hallelujah before you can reign before
[55:59] you can get to that position of kingship
[56:02] or rulership of authority first you need
[56:05] to suffer if you don't suffer
[56:10] you can never reign and revelation
[56:16] chapter 5 verse 10 says and he has made
[56:21] us unto our God kings and priests and we
[56:27] shall reign on earth
[56:29] oh what a what a what a wonderful
[56:32] thought he has made us hallelujah
[56:37] it speaks about you and me it speaks
[56:39] about the elders and the thousands of
[56:43] the throngs that worship in numbers were
[56:46] crying unto God holy and you are worthy
[56:48] to receive honor and riches and power
[56:52] and glory hallelujah but the lamb has
[56:58] made us kings unto God
[57:01] hallelujah but I'm thankful that he did
[57:04] not only made us kings but he made us
[57:07] kings and priests kings and priests
[57:11] hallelujah before he became because
[57:16] before he becomes a lion he first came
[57:20] as a lamb Jesus Christ was a lamb and
[57:25] took the close book in his first coming
[57:28] when he became becomes a lion the
[57:32] sovereign ruler holding the open book
[57:35] how many understands that hallelujah
[57:37] it's this this is the second coming this
[57:39] is a coming of the Lord hallelujah the
[57:43] second time he's a lion not anymore a
[57:46] lamb but a lion hallelujah but I want to
[57:50] emphasize that before he became king he
[57:55] was first a lion right I'm sorry a king
[58:00] it was first a a priest before he became
[58:04] a lion he was first a lamb hallelujah so
[58:08] I'm thankful that he made us kings but
[58:14] before we can become become kings we
[58:18] need to first be lamps hallelujah so
[58:23] amen we we should not forget that
[58:27] because you know we sometimes we become
[58:29] so Revelator because you know we know
[58:33] all things talk about the Bible we know
[58:36] we know about the mysteries of the Bible
[58:39] and we tend to be up there you know we
[58:45] tend to be self-righteous we tend to be
[58:49] arrogant sometimes hallelujah when we
[58:53] say something it's got to be it we put a
[58:55] period and everything that we say and
[58:58] nothing can change it this is what what
[59:00] Kings do whatever the King says it shall
[59:05] come to pass but remember your priests -
[59:09] amen and priests amen reached it
[59:13] represents
[59:14] the grace of God we have to be
[59:16] representative of the grace and the love
[59:18] of God amen Bertram says grace and loved
[59:22] their twins hallelujah when you love
[59:26] people then Grace will start to begin to
[59:29] project because God so loved the world
[59:32] it projected a savior because of that
[59:36] love hallelujah
[59:38] so we cannot be kings without being
[59:41] priests first remember that alleluia
[59:50] why Judah but ROM says Oh Judah
[59:53] although Beaver shall not go before it
[59:56] between the knees knees which means the
[59:59] the bosom of Judah until Shiloh comes
[1:00:03] for he'll come through Judah and the
[1:00:06] lion the symbol of the tribe of Judah
[1:00:09] has prevailed hallelujah and he has
[1:00:14] overcome hallelujah and when when the
[1:00:20] Lion of the tribe of Judah when the
[1:00:22] Spirit of God comes in to a person and
[1:00:25] you experienced that new birth it will
[1:00:28] transform your life it will make you
[1:00:33] think like better band with thought he
[1:00:36] said in greatest battle ever thought he
[1:00:39] said no matter how wrong they are
[1:00:43] let's not this fellowship or
[1:00:46] disassociate ourselves with anything oh
[1:00:50] my I'm thinking of the message movement
[1:00:55] now you know we think we have the
[1:00:58] fullness of the word but because we
[1:01:02] think we are so related we don't want to
[1:01:06] associate with other people that are not
[1:01:08] as Revelator as we are and we tend to
[1:01:12] not fellowship in this group and not
[1:01:14] fellowship with that group because they
[1:01:16] don't believe the same way that we do
[1:01:18] they're not as righteous and they're not
[1:01:20] as holy they're not as strict as we are
[1:01:23] think of it no matter how wrong they are
[1:01:26] but one said
[1:01:27] that's not this fellowship or
[1:01:29] disassociate ourselves with anything as
[1:01:32] slow as we can with us so is that main
[1:01:36] thing that's the reason you're here and
[1:01:38] the rapture has not taken place because
[1:01:40] God wants you to win a soul
[1:01:43] hallelujah as long as we can win a soul
[1:01:46] let's go on with with it and wise as a
[1:01:51] serpent and harmless as a dog Sienna try
[1:01:55] try to win every soul that we can't oh
[1:02:00] my goodness I'm thinking of the tribes
[1:02:05] people in the Philippines remote parts
[1:02:08] of the Philippines I'm thinking of the
[1:02:11] eye test it'd be better by the way pitch
[1:02:14] Minister to some of them when we were in
[1:02:16] some ballast they came out came down
[1:02:18] from the mountains because but but a
[1:02:21] dead one wanted to see them but it was a
[1:02:23] long trip and you had to go through the
[1:02:25] rivers you have to eat sir it was a
[1:02:27] rough trip you need at least three hours
[1:02:29] to get there so what we did we just
[1:02:32] called them to the to a place in town to
[1:02:37] the plains near a village chips house
[1:02:41] and that's where we gathered them we put
[1:02:43] up tents
[1:02:44] and we gathered the tribes people and by
[1:02:50] the way it was able to minister to them
[1:02:53] amen he he preached about the name of
[1:02:56] the Lord he preached about the correct
[1:02:59] baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:03:00] hallelujah there are no three persons in
[1:03:03] one God Godhead but when one God there's
[1:03:07] only one person amen and and we need to
[1:03:11] be baptized in that name the name of
[1:03:14] that one person which is the Lord Jesus
[1:03:16] Christ and the tribes people took it so
[1:03:20] well and we've been trying to help to to
[1:03:25] minister to describes people even though
[1:03:29] it's tough going to this places you know
[1:03:34] we're actually helping a brother who
[1:03:41] works amongst that his own tribe people
[1:03:44] that itis but her Sousou Garten is his
[1:03:47] name you met him um butter sauce works
[1:03:51] and as an evangelist and he goes and
[1:03:54] sometimes he had to walk seven hours to
[1:03:57] get to the place and we gave we gave him
[1:04:00] a motorcycle that he can use but
[1:04:02] sometimes because of the high water she
[1:04:04] can ride it through the high waters of
[1:04:08] the river and he had to walk out in the
[1:04:11] rain and out in the heat of the Sun and
[1:04:15] now he's sick now but it has Sousou got
[1:04:18] that has been sick so you pray for
[1:04:20] ballet Azusa garden and but we have been
[1:04:23] helping him it's a great asset to bring
[1:04:25] this message to his old people tribes
[1:04:28] people and we're building a big church
[1:04:31] there and butter this church has given
[1:04:35] me money to build the church and to put
[1:04:38] a roof over it and we have assembled the
[1:04:42] roofing and everything and it's now on
[1:04:45] the jobsite and we're just waiting for
[1:04:48] the proper time to install it so that
[1:04:51] they they can have a place of worship
[1:04:54] how long you in England right in the
[1:04:57] mountains of Pinatubo another so I'm
[1:05:00] thinking I'm thinking about these people
[1:05:03] you know if we don't go to them oh well
[1:05:08] if bhadiya seuss did not have that
[1:05:11] burden to help his people who would
[1:05:15] hallelujah but better man said as long
[1:05:22] as we can win us all let's go with it
[1:05:25] this should be the number one burden of
[1:05:30] a person that's been with birth born
[1:05:34] again into the body of Christ by the
[1:05:38] Spirit of God hallelujah and then he
[1:05:41] says if a man no matter how much some
[1:05:46] other one to disagree with him
[1:05:51] if it doesn't feel that way then there's
[1:05:56] a lacking of Christ in his life I
[1:06:00] believe I believe I believe it from this
[1:06:04] heart or from that person's heart
[1:06:07] there's a lacking in Christ not his lips
[1:06:11] but his heart if we he don't Pete he
[1:06:15] don't feel that way towards humanity I
[1:06:19] was just breathing we're better man
[1:06:21] shoot the hands of a man whom a lot of
[1:06:27] people thought funny yeah he because he
[1:06:31] was acting funny and when better Benham
[1:06:34] had an interview with him he had a long
[1:06:37] title after his name and because and the
[1:06:41] first question that he asked better
[1:06:43] benhams
[1:06:43] was his affiliation and his title um and
[1:06:48] very BAM said I don't care about titles
[1:06:51] said it's the human race I'm interested
[1:06:56] in I'm interested in the human race not
[1:07:01] the Creed's not your organization your
[1:07:05] your sect or religion I'm not interested
[1:07:09] in that not not your color color of your
[1:07:11] skin but I'm interested in the human
[1:07:13] race they said I'll shake your hand for
[1:07:16] that because you're interested in the
[1:07:19] human race the suburban says if you if
[1:07:23] you can ask act this way if you cannot
[1:07:26] work with your brother who disagrees
[1:07:29] with you if you cannot love somebody who
[1:07:34] has no qualities that you can love love
[1:07:37] the unlovable he said then there's a
[1:07:41] lacking of Christ lacking of Christ in
[1:07:46] his heart oh god help us God filled this
[1:07:51] lack in our lives
[1:07:53] he meant to be able to work with people
[1:07:56] that don't disagree with us that don't
[1:07:58] agree with us hallelujah Birnbaum says
[1:08:04] that was Christ in Adam a trial Christ
[1:08:09] in the city oh and Daniel Christ in
[1:08:12] Moses Christ in David it was Jesus the
[1:08:17] same yesterday today and forever what
[1:08:19] the Word of God the word being
[1:08:21] manifested by these prophets so this
[1:08:28] made Moses asking God to say the people
[1:08:33] take a slide himself what was that
[1:08:36] Christ in Moses what was it in Judah
[1:08:41] that he was willing to give his life
[1:08:44] amen so that is his brother could be set
[1:08:47] free what was it hallelujah and that was
[1:08:50] this was really what or touched the
[1:08:52] heart of Joseph it's what this Judah was
[1:08:56] willing to give his life for his
[1:08:57] half-brother when he when he was the one
[1:09:01] who who suggested he be sold to to be a
[1:09:06] slave he didn't care what happened to
[1:09:09] Joseph hallelujah and Joseph you know he
[1:09:14] did not he didn't care for the other
[1:09:17] siblings actually he only cared for the
[1:09:20] full blood brother Benjamin that's why
[1:09:24] he wanted to retain him he wanted to let
[1:09:26] the others go think about it but because
[1:09:29] of what you did he displayed this this
[1:09:34] great love for his heart brother he was
[1:09:37] willing to give his life for the sake of
[1:09:39] his brother hallelujah that actually
[1:09:42] what was new what was what what boob
[1:09:45] Joseph to reveal himself to his brethren
[1:09:49] he said don't be afraid everything
[1:09:54] happened for a purpose
[1:09:56] God allowed all these things to happen
[1:09:59] in order to preserve life hallelujah and
[1:10:04] so we know we should not despair things
[1:10:09] happen in our lives things happen in our
[1:10:12] families that that are not pleasing
[1:10:17] sometimes you don't understand
[1:10:19] hallelujah
[1:10:21] but you know that all things work
[1:10:24] together for the good God allows things
[1:10:27] to happen to preserve life hallelujah
[1:10:36] Christ in Adam Adam did not forsake Eve
[1:10:41] he could have easily said oh yes Lord
[1:10:44] get rid of it you know make me another
[1:10:47] Eve another woman and God could do that
[1:10:51] but instead Adam went to her quickly and
[1:10:55] planted his seed in her bosom because
[1:11:00] Adam had a revelation if he had the seed
[1:11:03] of Adam in her hallelujah
[1:11:07] God could not touch her amen
[1:11:11] Adam you that as long as he was one with
[1:11:15] him he was one with her hallelujah God
[1:11:18] could not touch him why because Adam was
[1:11:21] a son of God hallelujah
[1:11:24] so Adam actually redeemed Eve amen
[1:11:29] hallelujah
[1:11:30] it was the Christ in Adam it was the
[1:11:33] Christ in his cycle it was a Christ in
[1:11:37] Daniel and Daniel prophesied about the
[1:11:41] seventh weeks of Daniel Amen huh that
[1:11:46] was he was expressing how much God loved
[1:11:50] Israel seventh weeks
[1:11:54] I remember when Peter said Lord how how
[1:11:59] how often should we put forgave our
[1:12:02] brethren
[1:12:03] seven times he thought that was a lot
[1:12:05] seven times
[1:12:06] when the Lord said no seventy times
[1:12:09] seven
[1:12:12] you might be wondering why seven two
[1:12:14] weeks that's seven two weeks God God
[1:12:20] determined upon himself to work in this
[1:12:24] within the 78 week period to in order to
[1:12:28] restore Israel my about the seventy
[1:12:32] weeks of Daniel seventy times seven
[1:12:37] seventy weeks of Daniel seven is the
[1:12:41] number of completion and when God
[1:12:43] forgives you it's a complete forgiveness
[1:12:49] hallelujah when God restores Israel it's
[1:12:53] gonna be a complete restoration amen
[1:12:57] that's why the seven seals are there not
[1:13:00] the seven mysteries the seven thunders
[1:13:04] we call it don't think there are seven
[1:13:08] teachings or seven doctrines now seven
[1:13:11] represents completion this is a complete
[1:13:15] revelation of himself when the seals
[1:13:19] were broken its Christ revealed himself
[1:13:23] completely to his church why what was
[1:13:28] the purpose so that the life that was in
[1:13:34] him can be poured out to the believer
[1:13:40] hallelujah first thing I want to say is
[1:13:46] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:13:51] was spent for others and that's
[1:13:55] perfectly eternal life when you say you
[1:14:00] go to church and we do we do go to good
[1:14:04] things and we do and that's fine but I'm
[1:14:07] sure that's fine but when you live your
[1:14:08] life to yourself you haven't got to turn
[1:14:13] alive
[1:14:15] because eternal life is living for
[1:14:18] others it poopit when it came when you
[1:14:23] come in the lamp of God does he live he
[1:14:26] had eternal life because he didn't live
[1:14:29] for himself he lived for others and you
[1:14:32] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:14:35] day that you don't live to yourself no
[1:14:38] more you live for others this is what
[1:14:44] the Holy Spirit will produce in your
[1:14:47] life you will have the heart very heart
[1:14:52] of Christ you will have that mainspring
[1:14:56] the whole Spirit of God will control
[1:15:00] every everything every every night every
[1:15:03] move every decision hallelujah and that
[1:15:07] you start living yours your life to
[1:15:09] benefit other people hallelujah may God
[1:15:13] help us amen
[1:15:16] to take on this spirit in our lives and
[1:15:20] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:25] don't try because if you keep on trying
[1:15:28] just fail we need to do is to receive
[1:15:33] the Holy Ghost and like I said it's
[1:15:36] available for each one of us today it
[1:15:40] was available right in Adams time it
[1:15:44] also made available during the days of
[1:15:47] the prophets of course we understand
[1:15:50] that the actual outpouring took place at
[1:15:54] the beginning of the New Testament at
[1:15:57] the birth of the church and I want to
[1:15:59] tell you God has made it available for
[1:16:02] you and me today
[1:16:04] you can receive the Spirit of God so
[1:16:07] that you think less and less of yourself
[1:16:11] you think more and more of Christ you
[1:16:15] think more and more of the attributes of
[1:16:19] Christ a believer is enough to beauty of
[1:16:21] Christ hallelujah and there are
[1:16:24] believers that has not heard this
[1:16:27] message there are believers in the
[1:16:30] mountains of the Philippines there are
[1:16:34] believers in the isolated islands in our
[1:16:37] country we have about 7,000 of them in
[1:16:40] our country and somebody has to take
[1:16:43] this message to these people somebody
[1:16:46] has to know about the love of God
[1:16:50] somebody has to manifest it before them
[1:16:53] you know our witness Kona can only be
[1:16:57] become powerful as they as the people
[1:17:01] see that what we believe we actually put
[1:17:05] into practice we actually live what we
