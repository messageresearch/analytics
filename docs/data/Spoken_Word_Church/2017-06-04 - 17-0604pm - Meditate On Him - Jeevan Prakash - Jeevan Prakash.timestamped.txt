[26:27] timing
[26:28] 45 minutes one hour so here you know
[26:33] blind bartimaeus the prophet of God
[26:35] preached in Lima 1957 here he says blind
[26:39] bartimaeus setting by gate
[26:42] perhaps in the sunshine of the direct
[26:45] rays of the palestinian sun shining on
[26:48] him by the wall blind bottom is you know
[26:53] that the prophet of God you know told us
[26:55] a lot of good things about him you know
[26:57] oh my
[26:58] he was walking from home huh to the
[27:01] highway and sitting there whole day he
[27:05] was not worried about the sun is shining

[27:11] 70 or 90 degrees or 100 degrees 100 in
[27:16] Palestine it's hot weather believe me
[27:19] you know I went to Dubai Sarge and Abu
[27:23] Dhabi you know for 20 days there is a
[27:27] message churches there you know and I
[27:30] couldn't survive there I couldn't
[27:33] survive there
[27:34] it's hot hotter than India I have a
[27:45] spiritual Sunday in Dubai you know he
[27:47] used to take care of our orphans old
[27:49] widows you know and when he was here in
[27:51] India then you know not open the doors

[28:16] all these April May and you it's hot you
[28:20] know so I couldn't survive there it's
[28:22] hot but he we see here the blind
[28:26] Bartimaeus he was helpless he need to
[28:30] take care of his wife and daughter
[28:32] that's what the Prophet said you know
[28:34] and every day you know I don't know what
[28:37] to go into that you know but every day
[28:39] he was walking and he was sitting on the
[28:42] highway near the wall huh that's what
[28:46] the Prophet said here you know and so he
[28:49] was meditating upon the Lord maybe

[37:27] thing you know and it takes meditation
[37:31] on the Lord to bring him in your
[37:33] presence I already read it
[37:35] so I forgot something remember Daniel he
[37:39] was in a bad shape he was a true man of
[37:43] God living for Christ living for God
[37:45] Almighty you know and they said for one
[37:49] month nobody should pray nobody should
[37:51] oh my dad was very terrible he said I
[37:54] can't I can't stay without praising my
[37:56] god not even a minute not even you know
[37:59] and he was he was he was he opened the
[38:01] windows and praying God you know three
[38:04] times a day and his enemies his enemies
[38:07] were watching him and they went and and
[38:10] complained to the king huh anyhow King
[38:14] was kind to Daniel but he couldn't do
[38:16] anything because he already signed the
[38:18] decree hmm oh my Daniel was put in the
[38:23] lion's den ah but there he was trusting
[38:27] God he was meditating upon God
[38:31] maybe Ezz he was afraid if it is in his
[38:35] in his body because he's he a physical
[38:38] body is always afraid you know fear you
[38:40] know but he was trusting in the Lord he
[38:43] was meditating upon the Lord you know
[38:45] maybe when when he was thrown inside you
[38:47] know maybe he saw that a baby he saw the
[38:50] Lions and maybe it was a little bit
[38:53] afraid oh my god ha oh my but he was
[38:57] meditating upon the Lord God came down
[39:03] hallelujah and shut the mouths of the
[39:06] Lions next the king came and O'Daniel
[39:13] men of God are you ok he said I'm ok by
[39:20] His grace nothing no no no no lion
[39:24] touched me huh Lord shut the mouths of
[39:27] the Lions o my king was very happy you
[39:31] know and you know the you know the Bible
[39:33] you know so what about Shadrach Meshach
[39:35] and Abednego because here you know when
[39:39] you meditate upon him huh oh my that he
[39:44] takes meditation on the Lord to bring
[39:46] him in your presence Shadrach Meshach
[39:49] and Abednego they were meditating upon
[39:51] him they they know they're going to
[39:54] throw into the fiery furnace but they
[39:57] were not afraid they challenged the king

[40:16] hmm meditate upon the Lord praise his
[40:20] wonderful name hallelujah
[40:23] thank you Jesus
[40:27] so I believe that this reason people
[40:30] doesn't have the victorious life in
[40:33] their hearts they should have it's
[40:37] because their thoughts are always and
[40:39] other things thank God for the Prophet

[40:52] always you know the raw worldly things
[40:55] they lusts
[40:56] you know they always think about the
[40:58] worldly things I believe that the reason
[41:00] people doesn't have the victory in their
[41:03] hearts that they should have because of
[41:05] that thoughts are on the other things
[41:08] let the meditation of my mind of my
[41:10] heart be acceptable unto thee O Lord I

[53:25] us as a whole group of people who

[53:35] 1st Corinthians 11 for having received
[53:40] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[53:41] unto you but the Lord Jesus the same
[53:44] night in which he was betrayed took
[53:46] bread and when he had given thanks he
[53:48] brake it and said take eat this is my
[53:51] body which is broken for you this do in
[53:54] remembrance of me after the same manner
[53:57] also he took the cup when he had supped
[53:59] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[54:02] my blood this do ye as oft as you drink
[54:05] it in remembrance of me
[54:07] for as often as you eat this bread and
[54:09] drink this cup you do shew the Lord's
[54:11] death till he comes wherefore whosoever
[54:14] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[54:16] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[54:19] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[54:22] let a man examine himself and so let him
[54:24] eat of that bread and drink of that Cup
[54:27] for he that eateth and drinketh
[54:28] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[54:31] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[54:34] body but this cause many are weak and
[54:36] sickly among you and many sleep for we
[54:40] would judge ourselves we should not be
[54:42] judged but when we are judged we are
[54:45] chastened of the Lord we should not be
[54:48] condemned with the world wherefore my
[54:50] brethren when you come together to eat
[54:52] tarry one for another and if any hung
[54:55] man hunger let him eat at home as you
[54:59] come not together under condemnation the
[55:02] rest when I said in order when I come
[55:06] it's a very solemn time to come to the
[55:09] communion we don't believe as a lot of
[55:11] people take it and leave it the priest
[55:14] has the power to change it and make it
[55:16] to literal blood or make it's a literal
[55:19] body you know we don't believe in that
[55:21] that would be contrary to the scripture
[55:23] because it would not be Jesus Christ
[55:25] doing it see that claim is ooh oh yeah
[55:28] we we have that power book I just don't
[55:30] see that because the communion if we
[55:34] really took it correctly commune means
[55:37] to fellowship it literally means to
[55:42] fellowship to get together we soul no
[55:45] it's to bread in the wine that's just
[55:46] the symbolic that goes there that we do
[55:49] but we know that the that the bread is
[55:52] not the body we know the wine is not the
[55:56] blood but we do know that it's the state
[56:00] of mind of the individual that's
[56:03] thinking about what is taking place
[56:06] because the Lord Jesus that was his last
[56:09] act was to give him the bread and give
[56:12] him the wine and any pie stone all right
[56:15] any in that he was explaining to them
[56:18] not that they were to do that essence
[56:21] time but it was a what they should think
[56:25] about who was taking their place think
[56:31] about it in the communion who took your
[56:33] place it would make us worthy of this
[56:45] Bible said he took the bread and blessed
[56:47] it father we thank you for this Fred's
[56:50] been made for this purpose for that the
[56:53] Lord we just thank you that we
[56:56] understand the truth because we know
[56:59] it's not your body the Lord is a symbol
[57:02] and what about a symbol and you lord
[57:05] it's a it's a loving understanding of
[57:08] what you've done for each one of us you
[57:11] gave your body in our place you gave
[57:14] your life to come and live in each one
[57:16] of us we ask you now that you would just
[57:18] think about a bread and the protectors
[57:21] that we may all be together is wanting
[57:23] you in Jesus name see it was a broken
[57:31] body that's why we don't just do like a
[57:35] lot we don't just stay order to bread it
[57:38] and keep it and put it up or to be at
[57:43] least more concerned than that to
[57:46] understand these things see this this
[57:50] bread was made today it will be burned
[57:54] before morning we won't keep it in house
[57:59] communion again I'm not throwing no
[58:01] stone but win it bad this we used to
[58:03] order at least keeping the freezer and
[58:05] just freeze it and keep it you know you
[58:08] know no I got but it's not to be that
[58:10] supposed to be ever done that's right
[58:12] man I felt every diet right it wasn't do
[58:15] it is bell every day said it's not that
[58:17] and then it is supposed to be on leaven
[58:20] it's not opposed to be just some Oh
[58:24] wafer if somebody's made you can order
[58:27] them you can order it you can get the
[58:29] little bread and you can get the little
[58:32] cups you can get everything you can do
[58:33] all kind of things down but that's not
[58:36] what it needs to be done it needs to be
[58:39] more sincere think about these things
[58:43] but what it means and what he done right
[58:46] into pious dish that we could protect
[58:50] like I said then we don't try to hold it
[58:52] over we burn it before the day ends
[58:58] because you don't try to hold it you
[59:01] know what happened in the in the
[59:02] wilderness and they had that manner it
[59:06] was great but when they tried to hold it
[59:09] over keep it to another day it would rot
[59:14] so we don't do that we do it in the
[59:17] correct order
[59:18] hey under Nanjing nice but we thank you
[59:26] for this wine we know that it's not your
[59:28] blood
[59:29] we know that for certainty and we know
[59:32] we made it in this Thai refer to be used
[59:35] but it is a symbol of your blood it was
[59:38] given for each and every one of us the
[59:41] Lord of symbol is a great thing because
[59:42] we will eat this little piece of bread
[59:45] and will drag this little bit of wine
[59:48] and tomorrow that will be blood cells
[59:51] yes maybe in our bodies for us to little
[59:53] instances and we thank you for that we
[59:56] just asked you to sanctify the wine and
[59:58] the protectors if we maybe do the
[1:00:01] recording you into sister
[1:00:14] come morning
[1:00:17] now walk by the river I'll rest knee the
[1:00:27] ever green tree I'll carry my cross
[1:00:37] through the midnight come morning
[1:00:43] Dyer's glory for me sometimes I despised
[1:00:52] and rejected and I questioned Oh fall
[1:01:00] under how long then I take one more loo
[1:01:09] at Mount Calvary and it gives me the
[1:01:16] strength to come morning hour by the
[1:01:26] river
[1:01:29] I'll rest knee the evergreen trees I'll
[1:01:38] carry my cross through the midnight come
[1:01:47] morning nerve lorry overly it's really
[1:01:55] something to know true Bible says you
[1:01:59] shall know the truth the truth will make
[1:02:00] you free what about the world has tied
[1:02:03] up with rituals and ideas and that's not
[1:02:07] throwing off on them did you go to one
[1:02:09] place today and you have the Communion
[1:02:11] and the priest would give you the bread
[1:02:14] you eat the bread he drinks the wine
[1:02:19] because he's your Holy Ghost
[1:02:23] that's what do you say you go to another
[1:02:26] place and it would be done this way
[1:02:28] another place has be done that way some
[1:02:32] people would have scream and holler at
[1:02:33] you say we take wine they so know we
[1:02:38] take grape juice well take some grape
[1:02:41] juice and set it out in the cook leave
[1:02:44] it sitting down a while
[1:02:45] and you'll find out it'll run the wine
[1:02:51] gets better with age
[1:02:54] see then your your grape juice wouldn't
[1:02:57] be a top of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:59] because it wouldn't fit like I said we
[1:03:03] make the bread it's made it it's
[1:03:05] unleavened bread it's made pacifically
[1:03:09] for one time units for this service and
[1:03:13] you know to be born burned because we
[1:03:16] don't try to hold nothing over and keep
[1:03:17] anything we try to do what the Word of
[1:03:21] God says the truth sets us free and
[1:03:24] that's wonderful to thank God for what
[1:03:27] we see and what we're doing you go back
[1:03:30] in there and you just get to reading
[1:03:33] some of that Old Testament and you'll
[1:03:36] find that there was different things
[1:03:38] left and there was a thing Jesus wasn't
[1:03:41] contrary no neither did he had anything
[1:03:44] new when he done the breaking of the
[1:03:48] bread and the giving of the wine if you
[1:03:51] go back study the Old Testament it was
[1:03:54] reserved for those things there was a
[1:03:56] thing to happen way covered it years ago
[1:03:59] for us there was a thing there in the
[1:04:01] scripture that's left when Jesus took it
[1:04:04] he didn't start a new thing he really
[1:04:08] brought into being what they were saying
[1:04:11] it's like when those used meat you know
[1:04:14] what they do they leave us here you know
[1:04:20] why because they leave it for Elijah
[1:04:23] because they believe he's going to come
[1:04:26] say all of those things were not just
[1:04:29] you know
[1:04:32] it's the Word of God yeah that's all
[1:04:53] protect again amen
[1:05:06] you can be a seated for a moment you
[1:05:08] like it ready you'd like to turn in your
[1:05:12] scriptures to the foot washing there's
[1:05:15] like another onesie some people do this
[1:05:19] and some do that we just try to follow
[1:05:21] the word it's in the word to be done why
[1:05:25] don't we do it why don't we fulfill the
[1:05:30] word this is the letter so the best that
[1:05:33] we know to do and understand John 13 and
[1:05:42] supper being ended the devil having now
[1:05:44] put into the heart of Judas Iscariot
[1:05:46] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[1:05:49] that the father had given all things
[1:05:51] into his hands and that he come from God
[1:05:55] and went to God he rises from supper and
[1:05:58] laid aside his garments and took a towel
[1:05:59] and girded himself after that he poured
[1:06:02] water into a basin and began to wash the
[1:06:04] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[1:06:07] towel wherewith he was girded then
[1:06:09] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said
[1:06:12] unto Him Lord just I wash my feet see
[1:06:16] that's what a lot of people would say
[1:06:17] today well you know when I wash feet we
[1:06:22] don't have to do these things well Jesus
[1:06:25] done you all just brought it over and
[1:06:28] explained the communion John is
[1:06:30] explaining the foot washing right and
[1:06:33] then if he's going to do it why can't we
[1:06:35] see when he comes to Simon Peter Peter
[1:06:38] said to the Lord Lord does not wash my
[1:06:40] feet jesus answered and said unto him
[1:06:43] what I dude I know it's not now but I
[1:06:46] shall know your
[1:06:46] laughter Peter saith unto him I shall
[1:06:49] never wash my feet look at him jesus
[1:06:52] answered him if I wash thee not thou has
[1:06:56] no part with me he said well that was
[1:06:58] only a spiritual washing agreed but if
[1:07:01] you have this spiritual washing I
[1:07:03] guarantee you're going to have the
[1:07:04] physical you won't argue about washing
[1:07:07] somebody's feet if you get to spiritual
[1:07:09] washing of your soul right and
[1:07:11] everything laying in order to right
[1:07:13] Simon Peter said to him Lord see once he
[1:07:16] said it if I don't wash you well no part
[1:07:19] with silent Peter saith unto Him Lord
[1:07:20] not my feet only
[1:07:22] but also my hands and my head the two
[1:07:25] dirtiest things it could think of right
[1:07:27] jesus said unto him he that is wash
[1:07:30] neither's not saved towards his feet but
[1:07:33] it's clean every wit and you're clean
[1:07:35] but not all for he knew who should
[1:07:37] betray him darfur said he you're not all
[1:07:41] clean so after he had washed their feet
[1:07:43] and taken his garments and was sat down
[1:07:46] again he said unto them no you what I
[1:07:49] have done to you you call me a master
[1:07:52] and Lord and you say well for so I am if
[1:07:57] I then your Lord and Master have washed
[1:07:59] your feet you also ought to wash one
[1:08:01] another's feet / have given you an
[1:08:04] example that you should do as I have
[1:08:06] done to you
[1:08:07] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:08:10] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:08:14] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:08:15] him if you know these things
[1:08:18] I like that last part because people
[1:08:21] would say does it really matter does it
[1:08:23] really matter about washing feet and
[1:08:26] time I like that last part what does it
[1:08:29] say happy REE if you do well don't take
[1:08:36] away my joy you're just going to what
[1:08:38] you want to okay let's stand together
[1:08:40] and be dismissed the sisters will go
