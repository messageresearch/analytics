[7:02] dominion over the fish of the sea
[7:05] and over the fowl of the air and over
[7:06] the cattle and over all of the earth
[7:09] and over every creeping thing that
[7:11] creepeth upon the earth so god made so
[7:14] god created man in his own image in the
[7:17] image of god created he him
[7:19] male and female created he
[7:22] them you may be seated the lord that is
[7:25] blessing to the reading of the word
[7:34] now i know that a lot of times i do a
[7:36] lot of reading
[7:38] and i do a lot of of uh
[7:41] giving you a lot of quotes
[7:42] for you to read
[7:44] sometimes i preach without reading them
[7:46] i just scan down and pick up the thought
[7:49] and that's fine but
[7:51] see i want you to know
[7:53] what the prophet said
[7:56] but in that way it's not what brother
[7:58] dale says
[7:59] and then you don't worry and wonder well
[8:01] now i wonder did brother brown say it
[8:04] that way i'll just give you the quotes
[8:05] and let you read it
[8:07] and that'll take care of it or that you
[8:09] can can say well at least he read to us
[8:12] and you know what was being said
[8:15] but now we had a wonderful time last
[8:17] night in the uh bible study and paul and
[8:22] we just appreciate everybody coming we
[8:24] were talking about the fivefold ministry
[8:26] and uh
[8:28] you know the things and
[8:30] and doing and uh you know i really
[8:32] enjoyed it myself of course i get to do
[8:34] it become like some things i get to do a
[8:36] lot of talking and
[8:38] but we do have questions and answers
[8:41] we do you know but we don't take that
[8:43] part of the service
[8:45] uh we did last night for sister trudy
[8:47] brother
[8:49] uh joe some ways gonna send it to her i
[8:51] guess or copy it for her to listen later
[8:54] because she wanted to do it she's in
[8:55] trinidad
[8:56] and
[8:58] her haiti which one i always forget
[9:01] but anyhow she's somewhere that's
[9:04] i can't remember all those countries
[9:07] but now
[9:08] i've been trying for the past couple of
[9:10] services
[9:11] especially now
[9:14] to
[9:14] talk to you about
[9:17] uh
[9:18] this you
[9:20] because you know everybody says oh well
[9:22] now we we know this and we know that but
[9:24] do you really know
[9:28] do you really know yourself come on
[9:30] brother
[9:31] do you really know what you are right
[9:34] i mean do you uh you know do you could
[9:36] ever consider that or just well i'm just
[9:38] here no
[9:40] we're here for a purpose
[9:42] and i believe we need to know more about
[9:45] ourselves
[9:46] in this hour than ever before
[9:49] because
[9:50] here we are coming to the end of all
[9:52] things
[9:54] and see you say well now
[9:56] i need to know about salvation well
[9:58] that's good we're going to get to that
[9:59] don't worry about it
[10:01] but
[10:01] how do you know what salvation is if you
[10:03] don't even know what you are
[10:06] well we know what we are we're trying to
[10:08] be and we're body spirits all over this
[10:10] and yeah
[10:11] but do you really know
[10:13] about yourself come on
[10:15] do you really understand yourself
[10:17] do you understand what makes you work
[10:19] and and tick and do and
[10:23] why you're like you are come on they
[10:25] you know do we really have that in
[10:27] understanding right now but i've been
[10:30] dealing with a past couple of services
[10:34] especially
[10:36] with
[10:36] just talking about an individual
[10:40] you know you me people a person
[10:44] and what a person really is
[10:47] and and even a fallen in a fallen estate
[10:52] that's right
[10:53] even in a fallen estate
[10:57] there is no animal on the earth like man
[11:00] amen that's right
[11:03] there there is no animal that can do
[11:05] even though
[11:06] we know the story of what happened in
[11:08] genesis and how that there was a
[11:10] uh uh a creature there that was uh just
[11:14] like a man
[11:15] right
[11:16] but what was the prophet said the
[11:18] difference between him what was the
[11:20] thing
[11:21] that the beast didn't have
[11:24] he didn't have a soul
[11:27] all right but yet he was an upright
[11:29] creature looked exactly like mankind
[11:31] maybe bigger as the prophet would say uh
[11:34] etc uh i don't look at that as you know
[11:38] even the people of the message they
[11:39] begin to seem to to want to be so
[11:42] spiritual but i don't look at the beast
[11:44] as being a great big hairy looking
[11:46] monkey
[11:47] i don't you know the monkeys got his
[11:49] place
[11:50] and man was made you know
[11:52] uh the the beast was made it was a a
[11:56] a an upright creature
[11:58] and and then the curse is what put it on
[12:02] on its belly to crawl
[12:04] and and that's what happened in the
[12:05] garden then to to cause the the problem
[12:09] you know that right uh the beast was
[12:11] used in a vicarious form as
[12:14] the prophet would call it right
[12:16] but see he didn't have a soul because
[12:19] that was the problem with the with the
[12:21] old testament that the animal life
[12:25] could not come back upon the human
[12:28] to be able to do it only covering
[12:32] us right right see until jesus come and
[12:35] and you think about it now
[12:37] uh
[12:38] in the beast line was it only just one
[12:42] i'm not making no doctrine i'm just
[12:45] talking all right was it just one beast
[12:49] now if it was a species like the other
[12:51] species
[12:54] then evidently they might have been more
[12:57] you know there might have been a good
[12:58] many of the the beast lineage you know
[13:01] and they would have been a male and a
[13:03] female in that beef lineage or you you
[13:05] left out something somewhere that's
[13:07] right my point is why couldn't god then
[13:10] have kept
[13:12] that beast
[13:15] and made him an offering
[13:20] he looked just like the man
[13:22] never thought of that
[13:25] look just like a man why couldn't he
[13:26] kept him and made him an offering
[13:28] because he didn't have a soul
[13:30] so it wouldn't have brought no you know
[13:32] would have done no god he was an animal
[13:34] all right then we're nothing out here
[13:36] but an animal right right
[13:40] that's what we are we're just an animal
[13:43] but god gave us a soul
[13:46] amen and that soul then
[13:49] even though
[13:50] it
[13:51] and i've kept trying to play make it
[13:54] down on the level
[13:55] of not even bringing it to salvation and
[13:58] a little bit we'll pick up into more
[14:00] into the line of the redeemed and talk
[14:02] about it but i've been trying to get you
[14:04] to just think natural
[14:07] you know to get a line up of
[14:10] of what a person is that you know like
[14:13] brother branham would say even in our
[14:14] fallen mistake we're little creators
[14:17] he said the bird builds its nest i know
[14:19] the animals adapt and i know there's a
[14:22] certain amount of
[14:23] reasoning form to an animal in the basis
[14:26] of of abilities but not like the human
[14:30] being
[14:32] it's not that form there it's in a
[14:34] different way
[14:36] to where it is because you can train an
[14:38] animal
[14:40] but now if you leave that animal alone
[14:42] it's going to build its nest the same
[14:44] way but if you go cut down all the trees
[14:47] it's going to build its nest in your
[14:48] house that's right
[14:50] right right but it's still going to
[14:51] build its nest obviously it's just a
[14:54] form of animals all right but the human
[14:57] being has creator ability
[15:00] subject to even the supernatural
[15:04] until the bible said that they would
[15:06] have to put them out of the garden
[15:08] because there was nothing that uh you
[15:10] know the imagination of man's heart it
[15:13] was continually evil right and there was
[15:16] nothing that would be withholding from
[15:18] the man look at what we went through in
[15:21] in just your lifetime right right
[15:24] we went from 9 70 years old you know
[15:27] from from a horse and buggy to go to
[15:29] church and and be one or two cars and a
[15:32] whole bunch of wagons sitting around the
[15:34] church you know
[15:36] and and from that to a you know
[15:39] interplanetary travel
[15:41] of actually going into space and and all
[15:44] of the things that's happening here in
[15:46] life that seemingly like i said the
[15:48] other day you know they take this
[15:49] monofilament they call it and they run
[15:51] this thing all the way out in california
[15:53] and there's ten thousand thousand phone
[15:56] calls going through that one thing and
[15:59] they're not crossing each other right
[16:01] and around the world instantly you can
[16:04] just dial right now and there's no delay
[16:07] used to be a little delay you know if
[16:09] you remember that you would you would
[16:11] call somewhere and there's a little
[16:12] delay in the speech and you still see it
[16:14] sometimes on your newsreel so you know
[16:16] what i'm talking about that you'll see
[16:18] the guy's mouth moving and then his
[16:19] words
[16:20] there's a little delay all right but
[16:23] it's not that away now it's always just
[16:24] instant all right you should talk
[16:26] anywhere in the world
[16:29] whoever thought we could do that right
[16:31] whoever thought that mankind would come
[16:33] to the place
[16:34] that those two prophets one day will lay
[16:38] in the streets of jerusalem and the
[16:40] whole world
[16:43] will be able to see them that's right
[16:46] right
[16:47] the whole world
[16:49] will be able to see
[16:51] them too laying there
[16:54] it don't have to be a time delay
[16:56] it'll be interesting that you can see it
[16:58] maybe a different time over here and
[17:00] what it is over there yeah but still you
[17:02] can see it now you see what i'm talking
[17:04] about that
[17:05] even in the fallen estate of mankind
[17:09] see god had to put us out of the garden
[17:12] because once the fall came
[17:15] and you brought the person into a
[17:19] sinful condition
[17:22] then naturally satan would be
[17:25] you know would come into
[17:27] to a dealing
[17:29] and there would be nothing refrain from
[17:31] us
[17:32] so he had to put us out
[17:34] but in that fallen mistake now that's
[17:36] what i've been trying to get you to see
[17:38] i know the human being consists of a
[17:40] body spirit and soul
[17:42] we know that i mean that's
[17:44] understandable but that's a unit
[17:46] of you that we live here the in a unit
[17:50] form
[17:51] but what's the real you
[17:55] which ones are most important
[17:59] which one is god dealing with trying to
[18:01] save right
[18:03] you're not trying to save your body
[18:06] and we don't believe in getting a new
[18:08] one no we believe this body will be
[18:10] redeemed
[18:11] because that's price 49 of the future
[18:12] home amen
[18:14] prophet said your soul is redeemed
[18:16] waiting the redemption of the body all
[18:18] right
[18:18] we believe that
[18:20] but which is the most important part of
[18:22] you which is the part that got lost
[18:25] it wasn't your body that got lost
[18:29] it just follows that line like that see
[18:32] the body without the spirit is dead i
[18:34] mean you you know you you
[18:36] see and that soul that's within us is
[18:39] the part that god is working on to try
[18:42] to bring to salvation because he must
[18:44] begin with the inner part of us amen all
[18:47] right
[18:48] and then that soul
[18:50] is what that that we covered and we gave
[18:52] you the quotes back on it
[18:54] but
[18:55] the part that we covered there that
[18:58] even a fallen condition
[19:01] you have a celestial
[19:04] body right right
[19:06] a place to go to
[19:08] it's the regions of the lost right
[19:11] brother around said whether you want to
[19:12] believe this up here or down there
[19:14] whatever he said if it's not saved it's
[19:16] going down
[19:17] exactly
[19:18] but it's a place to go to
[19:20] and what is that that you're talking
[19:22] about we only think about beyond the
[19:25] curtain of time
[19:27] and even in that people don't want to
[19:28] talk about that brother around saw those
[19:31] there and the angel of the lord referred
[19:34] to the scripture souls under the altar
[19:36] right
[19:38] but we want to talk about this that or
[19:40] the other somewhere instead of really
[19:42] seeing
[19:44] and here's brother branham the body
[19:46] laying on the bed now was he dead
[19:49] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[19:51] no
[19:53] the soul didn't leave the body like
[19:55] leaving it as a point of going out of it
[19:59] it's just the way that you speak in
[20:01] forms that you use to try to express
[20:04] what you're talking about
[20:07] because once man that we know we're body
[20:10] spirit soul but once man
[20:13] failed
[20:14] god begin in that soul part of man
[20:20] to try to bring us to the place of
[20:22] salvation
[20:24] right
[20:25] see then that was the part that needed
[20:27] the covering
[20:29] in the old testament
[20:31] was the soul of the individual david
[20:33] would cry out you know
[20:37] and say lord
[20:40] my soul thirst just after thee
[20:45] because that was the real david right
[20:48] but you see outside of you is not what
[20:50] god is dealing with he's dealing from
[20:52] the inside of you
[20:55] because if if the inside can get saved
[20:58] the outside's going to somewhere come
[20:59] under subjection or have to be laid down
[21:02] go by the grave come up and and
[21:04] everything and be changed all right
[21:07] we see all people then
[21:10] that's what it says in ezekiel 18 4c all
[21:14] souls are mine that's right satan can't
[21:17] create a soul i know the two soul
[21:19] doctrines and the things that was said
[21:21] that satan gave your soul and god gave
[21:23] your soul now where's that in the
[21:24] mission that's right
[21:26] now run around said satan perverted the
[21:29] nature of your soul right amen
[21:31] that's right
[21:33] then when you did people say well a soul
[21:35] just a natural spirit now they need my
[21:37] quote for that that's right
[21:39] now the quote is the soul is the nature
[21:41] of the spirit amen there's no quote it
[21:43] says the soul is just the nature of the
[21:45] spirit because see that was the way they
[21:46] was quoting and i told them then that
[21:48] was incorrect what they were doing
[21:51] but my point of what i want you to see
[21:53] is that even in the fallen estate
[21:57] we are subject to supernatural things
[22:02] we're subject to
[22:03] to
[22:04] uh creative abilities
[22:08] see
[22:08] in that part because of the soul right
[22:12] but our soul is not eternal
[22:15] you must receive the new birth before
[22:17] it's eternal i know all of the quotes
[22:19] all of the things we done been through
[22:20] it this is message number 19 on
[22:23] predestination so we've done been
[22:25] through all of that where brother brown
[22:26] said if you have eternal life
[22:30] that's right
[22:31] then you always was eternal right
[22:34] what
[22:35] if you have it right
[22:37] that's right well i come into the world
[22:39] eternal life you don't need jesus that's
[22:41] right that's right you just need a good
[22:43] shot right between the eyes and take you
[22:45] out of the world
[22:47] you know i'm carnal
[22:49] but there's one thing about it it gets
[22:50] to point across
[22:52] you know what i'm talking about you
[22:54] don't have to go away and say i don't
[22:55] know what brother dale means you know
[22:57] what i mean i tell you what i mean
[23:00] that's right whether you like it or
[23:01] whether i even like it i say it
[23:04] now
[23:05] see when you were birthed from your
[23:07] mother
[23:10] then is when brother brown says life
[23:12] comes in
[23:13] that's right the wiggling muscles in
[23:15] there is just like an animal right
[23:18] all animals in the wound is the same way
[23:20] us and all rest the soul's not in there
[23:23] i don't care what mankind says we know
[23:26] what the prophet says
[23:28] all right he said when that life then
[23:30] when the baby is dropped
[23:32] from the mother and then god breathes
[23:34] the breath of life
[23:37] into
[23:38] the person see or puts the soul and
[23:41] spirit within the body
[23:43] that has been dropped from mother
[23:45] then you become a living soul
[23:48] now that's not using it as an eternal
[23:51] soul
[23:52] that's right because if you had an
[23:54] eternal soul what do you need jesus to
[23:55] come and die for
[23:57] see then you have all mankind
[24:01] having to be deal with and i don't
[24:02] believe it i believe you must receive
[24:04] eternal life
[24:07] all right but once you receive it the
[24:09] eternal life that you have always was
[24:12] eternal
[24:13] that's why over in john it said the seed
[24:15] remain opinion you cannot sin
[24:17] now the prophet said we were talking a
[24:18] while ago down everybody brought around
[24:20] said christians the only one who can sin
[24:23] now what's he saying
[24:25] but the bible says the seed remaineth in
[24:27] you and it cannot what the seed can't
[24:29] sing
[24:30] amen that's right right you and i could
[24:32] still do wrong brother brown do you sin
[24:34] he said every day
[24:38] no that's his words
[24:40] we don't like to quote those things we
[24:42] want to we want to make everything you
[24:44] know goody two shoes over on his side
[24:47] you know but he didn't want to make it
[24:48] that way he told it like it was
[24:51] he said i was born
[24:53] a hybrid
[24:55] but we don't like them folks
[24:58] these people can quote a lot of quotes
[24:59] but they they don't like all of them
[25:01] together all right but now trying to get
[25:03] over to a point where you can just
[25:04] understand
[25:07] see then we saw as i said that when we
[25:09] die
[25:10] as a natural person without
[25:12] not talking about salvation yet now
[25:15] as a natural person when we die
[25:18] there's a part of us go somewhere to
[25:19] wait
[25:21] we know the body goes to the grave
[25:23] rotten whatever you want to do with it
[25:24] they can preserve it now but
[25:26] you know
[25:29] but the soul
[25:31] lives on somewhere
[25:33] that's right
[25:35] so it's in one of the regions
[25:37] it's either under the fifth dimension
[25:40] which is the center dead
[25:42] or
[25:43] it's under the sixth dimension
[25:46] which is more or less the christian that
[25:48] has died
[25:49] you know
[25:50] all right
[25:51] so we have a place to go and what goes
[25:53] there the soul right amen
[25:56] that's right what did jesus do i gave it
[25:59] to you there on the trolls in prison
[26:01] jesus went to hell and preached the
[26:04] prophet said to souls that were in
[26:07] prison
[26:09] i know the bible what it says it says
[26:10] spirits
[26:12] but you cannot if you can't
[26:14] differentiate and write you pronouncing
[26:16] the old words
[26:17] between soul and spirit in your natural
[26:20] reading of the bible
[26:21] because it overlaps itself so much
[26:24] that's why it took brother branham all
[26:26] of those years
[26:27] because you know yourself what i've said
[26:29] is true
[26:31] basically up until 1962 on the greatest
[26:34] battle ever fought i said basically
[26:36] listen brother random talk body
[26:40] soul
[26:42] spirit
[26:44] see that's where you two soul people
[26:45] come along said you get a new soul right
[26:47] the bible doesn't say that so the bible
[26:49] says you get a new spirit all right
[26:52] the ezekiel
[26:54] that's right what is it 35 or what is it
[26:57] somebody help me in there 35 36 or
[26:59] something where i give you a new heart
[27:01] to your spirit
[27:04] now watch what i'm saying see up until
[27:05] that time even brother branham would
[27:08] would
[27:10] lay those things backwards and forth
[27:12] and seemingly not being able to have a
[27:15] clear understanding well that would be
[27:16] perfectly with hebrews 4 12. that the
[27:20] word of god as it would open to the
[27:22] prophet would let him discern between
[27:25] spirit and soul
[27:27] but then after the greatest battle ever
[27:29] fall if you're watching he'll go this
[27:30] way that way in that message but then
[27:33] after then he begins to bring it body
[27:36] spirit
[27:37] soul
[27:38] but here's the point you say well he
[27:40] never did preach it brother dale
[27:43] he didn't have to preach it over
[27:46] because he always gave the outside man
[27:49] the body he gave it five senses seek
[27:52] taste fill smell here all right
[27:55] the second realm of man whether you want
[27:57] to call it soul or spirit the second
[28:00] realm of man has memory reason conscious
[28:03] affection what's the other love
[28:05] imagination all right
[28:08] but the center part of man he only gave
[28:10] it one sense
[28:12] it's not faith and doubt see that would
[28:14] be the two soul doctrines
[28:16] that would put god and the devil
[28:18] together and my bible said god won't
[28:19] dwell in an unclean vessel now you can
[28:21] do what you want to
[28:22] i'm not against anybody i'm just tell it
[28:24] like it is
[28:26] they sure tell me like it is
[28:28] tell me they don't agree with me that's
[28:29] all right i don't have no problem with
[28:31] it
[28:32] you can leave your big toes god just
[28:33] don't ask me to kiss it
[28:35] i'm not going to worship the thing
[28:37] but you do what you want to because
[28:39] you're a human mortal like it's where
[28:41] the constitution gives you that right
[28:43] now the bible though
[28:45] there's nowhere in the bible that you
[28:46] got right believe what you want to
[28:47] believe amen according to the
[28:49] constitution you can believe what you're
[28:50] wearing
[28:51] all right but now get what i'm saying
[28:54] that soul is either faith or doubt
[28:59] if you're not born again the nature of
[29:01] your soul is doubt right
[29:03] that's right
[29:05] totally in the form of doubt and if it
[29:08] dies that way where's it going
[29:14] it's got to go to the regions of the
[29:15] office there ain't no extra places
[29:17] running around
[29:19] but if you're born again it's faith
[29:22] all right future home
[29:24] the prophet draws two hearts now to me
[29:26] that's one heart you can do what you
[29:28] want to but i believe that was
[29:30] describing
[29:32] because he said here's one heart and he
[29:34] put a snake in it
[29:36] he said that's old the old nature that's
[29:38] right
[29:39] then he draws another one he put a dove
[29:41] in
[29:43] i believe he was drawing the same heart
[29:46] in the two conditions right when we come
[29:48] into the world we come into the world
[29:49] with the nature of satan right amen all
[29:52] right lost and doomed and on the way to
[29:55] hell
[29:57] that's why the unclean spirit has to go
[29:59] out jesus said
[30:00] see before you talk about salvation all
[30:02] right
[30:03] now so there's that snake in there that
[30:06] was it and he said that snake goes out
[30:09] and the dove comes in
[30:11] so it went from doubt to faith
[30:16] all right now we're in the message then
[30:17] we know what we're talking about
[30:20] but now here's what i've been trying to
[30:21] get you to see
[30:24] that even in a fallen estate now you're
[30:26] still with me
[30:28] even in a fallen estate
[30:30] your soul was created in the image of
[30:33] god right
[30:34] because you're a little creative
[30:38] there's nothing can be withholding from
[30:42] a human mortal
[30:44] that can reason it out
[30:46] amen
[30:47] that's right you ever heard of uh what
[30:50] is it um what is the radio to the head
[30:53] is it
[30:54] it's made from either waves it's made
[30:56] from cat powers or whiskers they call it
[30:58] but
[31:00] you know
[31:00] i mean they had that in the 40s
[31:03] that you didn't have to have no power
[31:05] you didn't have to have no nothing
[31:08] and they had a radio
[31:11] see
[31:12] man had devised that so i told you
[31:14] brought them up and then were studying
[31:16] he said they were doing it at the end of
[31:18] world war ii how to decompose a human
[31:20] being and send him to california
[31:22] and they could do that
[31:25] but they just couldn't get him back
[31:26] together
[31:27] right then all right
[31:29] well what do you think they're dealing
[31:30] with now
[31:33] look at the things of mankind look at
[31:36] even your medical signs
[31:38] talking brother richard this morning his
[31:40] sister just had a knee replacement
[31:43] and i said brother richard we don't
[31:44] believe in getting a new body you know i
[31:47] leave this body redeemed okay
[31:49] i believe that now i believe this body
[31:50] is going to be redeemed but you know
[31:52] what they're just making you new parts
[31:54] now and you can go have a new knee put
[31:56] them you can have everything that
[31:59] they've transplanted everything
[32:02] except the brain
[32:03] and you better believe they're they're
[32:04] working on that
[32:06] but that's the only thing i know of that
[32:08] hadn't transplanted right
[32:10] so then you could be a new man it might
[32:12] cost about 50 million dollars danny's
[32:15] pretty good going pretty good he's a
[32:16] couple of millions now from falling off
[32:19] that chicken house and thing
[32:21] but that still ain't going to make him
[32:23] new because he's still our old body's
[32:25] rotten away don't make no difference but
[32:27] all right but now listen because see the
[32:29] body's not in the image of god right now
[32:33] right the soul is what's in the image of
[32:35] god
[32:37] the the body is in the image of the
[32:39] animal like
[32:41] that's why i gave you a quote that's in
[32:43] there where brother brown says
[32:45] it says let us make man he said he was
[32:47] talking to the animals
[32:50] brother god was talking to the animals
[32:53] about how to make the man
[32:55] but we're going to have to really get
[32:56] into something in a minute because
[32:58] you have to hold that to a good point
[33:00] right there but watch that all right
[33:03] but now watch
[33:04] see then if we die we have a place to go
[33:07] to
[33:08] what's going there the soul
[33:12] the soul
[33:14] because that's you
[33:15] that's a celestial right
[33:19] all right
[33:21] and brother brown even uses the word for
[33:23] it as a theophany
[33:26] because see we look at the word
[33:28] theophany and we just make it whatever
[33:31] we want to make it but put around made
[33:33] it a theophany is a a body right above
[33:38] these bodies
[33:40] that you're looking after
[33:43] more real right what did he say about
[33:45] beyond the curtain of time i told you i
[33:47] used to have the idea that
[33:49] uh you know your your soul your your
[33:52] things had no feeling whatsoever
[33:55] and i preached it that way and then one
[33:57] day i had to come out here and correct
[33:58] my own preaching card then i found where
[34:00] the prophet said in that soul beyond the
[34:02] curtain of time that they had feelings
[34:04] and senses and could feel and things
[34:06] like that so i lied i kicked off what i
[34:10] thought and i still believe what he said
[34:12] that the soul don't eat
[34:18] the soul don't eat it don't have to eat
[34:20] it eats spiritual
[34:23] it eats greater right now
[34:26] and what did it eat if we're lost right
[34:29] the devils mean you
[34:32] what does it eat if we're saved
[34:34] from god's menu all right so we just
[34:36] keep going right all right now so we
[34:40] have a place to go to
[34:42] jesus went and preached to those souls
[34:45] in prison
[34:48] they were in their souls there
[34:51] and he preached to him but they couldn't
[34:53] be saved
[34:55] but they were real people there
[34:57] now not 16 element bodies right
[35:04] the soul right what is the soul of man
[35:08] well it's just that little winch square
[35:10] compartment you know that's sitting
[35:12] uh see
[35:14] now brother when he was explaining that
[35:16] if you'll read it real careful he said
[35:18] science says maybe that could be the
[35:20] abode of the soul
[35:23] is your soul an in square compartment
[35:26] or is it the real you
[35:28] that's right
[35:30] but brother said it like this is what he
[35:32] said you don't see me
[35:35] he said you see the body
[35:37] i inhabit it right amen
[35:40] but now what does it look like what did
[35:42] them people be on the curtain of time
[35:44] that brother around went there and the
[35:46] angel said these are souls under the
[35:48] altar
[35:50] now what they look like
[35:52] people
[35:53] right right right
[35:56] that's the men had shoulder length
[35:58] higher
[36:00] right
[36:01] they had on
[36:02] kind of like
[36:04] garments of gowns and things
[36:08] but they were real man he said you could
[36:11] feel them
[36:12] well what about the regions of the lost
[36:16] did he not go to the heart he said i've
[36:18] been to both places right
[36:23] but like i've told you if you'll
[36:24] remember get it correct
[36:26] you go check when he went to the regions
[36:28] of the lost
[36:30] he was like 12 or 14 or somewhere right
[36:32] in there years old that's before he's
[36:33] born again
[36:36] but he saw them women coming up in jc
[36:38] pennies and he said that was exactly
[36:40] what they looked like down there
[36:42] with the painted faces and the goo gosh
[36:44] and all other things that was going on
[36:47] right
[36:48] because they were people
[36:51] not 16 element bodies
[36:53] no but it's greater than that that's
[36:56] what i'm trying to get us to see
[36:59] see the real you
[37:01] and that's the part god is working on to
[37:04] try to save us
[37:07] it's the part of us that's real right
[37:09] amen
[37:10] not just thoughts
[37:12] all right now all right we get off now
[37:15] okay now here it goes on tape
[37:17] here to you i'm gonna say it twice where
[37:19] you'll remember now we're going to
[37:21] change from just being talking about a
[37:23] natural person
[37:25] we're going to talk about people that
[37:27] can be redeemed all right amen
[37:29] all right
[37:30] you understand me
[37:32] we put enough in to talk about
[37:34] the real you that you ought to be able
[37:36] to understand a lot about
[37:38] and and find out why you went the way
[37:40] you went
[37:43] but as i've tried to tell you now
[37:46] even in that fallen condition
[37:50] that soul brother adam would even call
[37:53] it immortal
[37:56] then was he calling it eternal no
[38:01] well immortals eternal immortal means
[38:03] like mortality and this is mortality
[38:07] immortal means like you've got to
[38:09] connect back together with body spirit
[38:11] and soul
[38:12] so you know but i'm just saying just
[38:14] give me that where you won't come up and
[38:16] somebody said look at this quote well i
[38:18] just give you the quote
[38:21] but it says it's a supernatural he
[38:24] called it
[38:25] amen
[38:26] your soul is supernatural
[38:28] why because it's created in the image of
[38:30] god amen
[38:32] oh no my old dirty rotten smell
[38:34] god didn't make your soul dirty and
[38:36] rotten
[38:38] amen and don't blame him
[38:41] you know the message brother said don't
[38:43] blame adam and eve
[38:45] right
[38:47] he said you better blame yourself for
[38:48] what you are
[38:50] we put ourselves in the pawnshop of the
[38:52] devil's world
[38:55] when god created us the soul and put it
[38:57] in the individual that soul was perfect
[39:01] now i did not say eternal
[39:06] i know the difference in the word
[39:08] the word perfect because god can't
[39:10] create something imperfect where would
[39:13] he get it
[39:15] right
[39:16] every little baby you see the soul the
[39:18] spirit of that baby is perfect amen and
[39:21] if the body is as perfect as can be
[39:24] under the conditions of mankind
[39:27] i told you see i'm old enough to
[39:28] remember babies used to if they were
[39:31] nursing their mother for six months are
[39:32] almost immune to sicknesses
[39:35] we're perverted now and dying
[39:39] but it used to be a whole lot of
[39:40] difference
[39:44] but you understand what i'm saying
[39:46] now we get that out of the way
[39:49] that's the real you
[39:51] but now that's the part that god wants
[39:53] to work on is the real you sold in
[39:56] prison we'll get to it eventually
[39:58] he said if he can get that soul to stand
[40:00] still long enough
[40:03] he said it'll die
[40:08] why because we need something right
[40:10] all right so now let's get off the
[40:12] natural
[40:13] and get now into speaking of the
[40:16] spiritual condition because we're going
[40:18] to start talking about the children of
[40:19] god amen
[40:21] all right
[40:22] that's why i read the 126-27 now 126-27
[40:26] is not according to what my
[40:28] understanding is not the creation of
[40:31] every person in the world
[40:33] now ezekiel 18 4 covers that
[40:38] ezekiel 18 4 says all souls are mine
[40:42] but the soul incentive shall die
[40:44] see now does everybody understand that
[40:46] part it's not your body that's gonna the
[40:48] problem
[40:49] it's not your spiritual problem it's
[40:52] your soul that's gonna die
[40:55] because your soul can be saved
[41:00] see when the first man
[41:02] was
[41:04] made now i want to ask you a question
[41:09] when was the first man made when was
[41:11] that
[41:12] in the image of god
[41:14] 126-27
[41:20] you say well it had to be on the sixth
[41:21] day because it's done you don't got six
[41:23] days of creation and then you've got man
[41:25] now all the natural man come on the six
[41:28] days
[41:30] the human flesh of genesis 2 came on the
[41:32] sixth day that's right i gave you some
[41:34] quotes
[41:35] let's see
[41:37] get on to the backside
[41:40] the last one no numbers to it
[41:44] around says on demonology physical
[41:47] number one physical you know what i'm
[41:48] talking about is one physical one in a
[41:50] spiritual realm
[41:52] 1953
[41:54] um
[41:55] 608 hey
[41:58] but your souls were made up before the
[42:00] foundation of the world when god created
[42:02] man in his own image
[42:07] so before the world was created amen day
[42:10] one
[42:12] okay
[42:13] day one the world was created right
[42:17] day two this was created day three
[42:19] that's what they've been
[42:21] this
[42:22] man was made before the foundation
[42:24] that's right yes sir
[42:27] amen watch it when god created man and
[42:31] his own image spirit of man not a man in
[42:34] his own image no watching
[42:37] but man in his own image and he made
[42:40] them male and female before he ever made
[42:42] a man in the dust of the earth
[42:44] all right
[42:46] so now we start off with what we can
[42:48] look at and see
[42:53] this man that was made and you're going
[42:55] down to the next position in christ
[42:58] and you'll see there that he said it was
[42:59] made before the foundation world
[43:03] this man was made
[43:06] to rule the earth
[43:10] and he was a spiritual being right
[43:13] because what is god
[43:15] now we've been through that you know
[43:16] what i'm talking about
[43:18] the bible says god is a spirit well what
[43:20] kind of an image of a man did god make
[43:23] right a spirit man
[43:27] himself
[43:29] all right
[43:31] now
[43:31] and he gave him control of the animals
[43:35] all right now when that man was put in
[43:37] human flesh in genesis 2 he not only had
[43:41] control of the animals he had the
[43:43] ability to name all of them
[43:47] right
[43:49] adam named the animals genesis 2 or 3
[43:52] there and it was brought to him and he
[43:53] named them
[43:55] i never can pronounce all them heck with
[43:57] hopefully one of them words they got for
[43:59] all them things that i like i'd rather
[44:00] call them alligators and buyers and deer
[44:03] and stuff like that they got all these
[44:04] great big words for them
[44:06] but
[44:07] still adam named him
[44:11] now remember
[44:13] in this creation of 126
[44:18] it was made male and female that's right
[44:22] now we don't believe in garbage cans
[44:25] likes talking the message and i don't
[44:27] believe god is amorphous
[44:29] if you don't like them words forgive me
[44:33] i don't believe that god is like a a
[44:37] a worm
[44:38] that could be male or female
[44:41] that every part is needed can supply
[44:44] i don't believe in garbage cans
[44:47] i believe in the right way because
[44:50] brother branham said and i didn't get to
[44:51] bring this but if you want it i'll be
[44:53] able to find it for you in a hurry
[44:55] he said eve was in adam
[44:58] in theophany right
[45:00] amen
[45:02] now that's our record it's in the hebrew
[45:03] series but i'll be glad to find it for
[45:05] you
[45:06] he was in adam
[45:09] because the bible said he made him male
[45:11] and female
[45:12] that's right that's right
[45:14] now that's in the image of god so when
[45:17] he put him in flesh where was he
[45:22] you know
[45:23] because you come from heaven
[45:25] right right
[45:27] see so then
[45:28] you sisters it ain't just the male is
[45:30] the only one in this thing that can
[45:32] speak the word right amen that's right
[45:36] amen what did he need for
[45:38] come on
[45:40] that's right
[45:41] if adam was so much of a
[45:45] that he could be male or female what did
[45:46] he need any for
[45:49] now brother brown said
[45:51] that god gave his ease to reproduce
[45:53] himself
[45:55] because that's what the church is
[45:56] supposed to do
[45:59] is to not reproduce themselves
[46:02] but to reproduce
[46:04] god
[46:08] all right now we're going on a little
[46:09] okay
[46:10] so now watch
[46:14] what kind of of a being was god
[46:21] he's a spiritual being
[46:23] but see we say spiritual being spiritual
[46:25] being
[46:30] right
[46:32] you know i'm blowing to somebody that
[46:33] can't see and you can hear it i'm just
[46:35] blowing like a wind you know just and
[46:37] run around said god is not like the wind
[46:44] any of these quotes you need call me
[46:46] he's not like the wind he said he's a
[46:49] being
[46:52] what do we think he is
[46:54] you know is it some kind of a just a
[46:58] a vapor
[47:00] or a pillar of fire now that was the
[47:02] form god chose to be able to bring to
[47:04] the human eye to be able to comprehend
[47:07] whirlwinds and et cetera
[47:11] god is real amen
[47:15] you think you're more real in here
[47:20] you got a human problem somewhere
[47:21] between the
[47:22] ears amen
[47:26] to think we're more real than god is
[47:30] he brought us here you better remember
[47:32] that
[47:33] he created us
[47:35] we didn't create him that's where the
[47:36] trouble of the people the message they
[47:38] try to make
[47:40] eve being the one that gave birth to
[47:42] adam
[47:44] i wouldn't quite go that way
[47:47] all right but now follow me
[47:49] so then what kind of a being was god
[47:54] okay
[47:57] we say well he was a spiritual being
[48:00] see
[48:01] that's the finish the hardest seeming
[48:03] thing that i've tried for 40 years now
[48:05] to preach
[48:06] because i don't see god like
[48:10] i think a lot of people think they see
[48:13] what is he some kind of just a glob
[48:18] no form
[48:20] well he's just a spirit brother dale
[48:25] no he's a spiritual being
[48:27] ain't just a spirit he's a spiritual
[48:29] being
[48:30] he's not like the wind he's real
[48:35] what did he look like before he ever
[48:37] created anything else
[48:43] if you're going to believe your soul is
[48:45] your theophany father down with me to
[48:46] come to jesus christ i believe
[48:50] that's what he looked like amen
[48:54] amen
[48:56] i believe that's what god looked like
[48:59] because you know what that's the kind of
[49:00] man he wants
[49:06] all right
[49:06] now
[49:08] but you see then we get down to where
[49:09] the prophet is talking about it on
[49:10] hebrews number three of your notes
[49:12] 57 901
[49:15] he said is there true eternal life
[49:19] and he's asking the question
[49:22] he said you couldn't answer that could
[49:24] you
[49:26] is there to eternal life
[49:31] he says you couldn't answer that
[49:34] i see we'd be a dummy to try
[49:38] no
[49:39] there's only one form of eternal life
[49:41] when he goes on says there's one eternal
[49:43] life and that's the life of god amen
[49:48] this other kind of life no matter what
[49:51] it is
[49:52] it's got an end to it
[49:54] and anything that had a beginning has an
[49:56] end but anything that had no beginning
[49:59] has no end and that's what your prophet
[50:01] is saying
[50:02] god said he would give us eternal life
[50:05] without beginning
[50:07] we were just made a part of him
[50:10] and actually the life that's in us
[50:13] wasn't brought here by human nature
[50:20] nature gives a spirit
[50:22] but that spirit died and we got the
[50:24] spirit of god
[50:27] was god a man
[50:32] now according to
[50:34] uh what is it uh
[50:37] hebrews
[50:38] 7. it talks about melchizedek calls him
[50:41] a man right
[50:46] a man
[50:47] and that's talking about god right
[50:52] but brother dale you just make god too
[50:55] too uh
[50:58] natural
[50:59] yeah
[51:01] if there's ever anything natural here
[51:03] they had to be a natural god
[51:05] amen
[51:06] that's not no good language i know that
[51:09] because i don't know how to talk i got
[51:11] my ants and totes and carries and stuff
[51:13] like that and hard to translate i know
[51:14] that but still to me god is real amen
[51:19] that's right he's not just a spirit just
[51:22] floating around
[51:23] and one day when we get up to heaven
[51:25] there's going to be a halo over here and
[51:27] there's going to be a spirit floating
[51:28] over here like no capitalist got him
[51:30] with some kind of a dove you know that's
[51:32] floating down and
[51:33] and all these things
[51:36] the bible says the holy spirit came down
[51:38] in what the form of a dove it wasn't a
[51:40] dove it's a form of a dove
[51:43] that was the form god took to be able to
[51:45] be seen
[51:48] me
[51:49] i believe god is real
[51:53] me
[51:54] come on folks if we're real what is god
[51:56] so what did brother brown say
[51:58] was god a man certainly
[52:02] now we're reading what he said
[52:04] let us make man in our own image what
[52:07] was god a theophany
[52:09] a body
[52:11] and our god man was made like that
[52:15] and put over the garden but there was no
[52:18] man to till the soul in the senses right
[52:23] all right
[52:24] so when the animals come into the world
[52:26] on what day fours and fives i think is
[52:28] the days of of animals and things might
[52:31] be into six but anyhow somewhere along
[52:33] about the fifth day of animal life
[52:36] all right
[52:37] you go back and read it
[52:39] see then this man that i'm talking about
[52:41] was there to lead the animals
[52:46] in a theophany
[52:52] but to me if the often he's real amen
[52:56] that's what's so thrilled me when i
[52:58] began to see when brother brown said
[52:59] when he went beyond the curtain of time
[53:01] that he could feel them people
[53:04] they were real
[53:09] brother brown said
[53:12] moses saw the back part of a man
[53:16] and he said it was that theophany man
[53:19] that created all things
[53:22] and moses saw the back part
[53:25] he couldn't see the front part because
[53:27] that would have been bringing the face
[53:29] into view and the bible says no man has
[53:31] seen the face of god and lived see
[53:33] because that would put him you know into
[53:35] a condition he's got to come into
[53:37] something to be able to be made but when
[53:39] jesus christ came here he was almighty
[53:40] god amen
[53:43] that's why he said at least unless you
[53:45] believe that i am he you will die in
[53:46] your sins that's right
[53:49] he who
[53:52] unless we believe that was almighty god
[53:54] walking on the earth in human flesh
[53:59] he will die in our sins
[54:01] because sin is unbelief
[54:03] so what'd he say
[54:05] so when he made that man he put him in
[54:07] the garden over the animals and things
[54:11] then you go on down to the bottom what
[54:13] did it say and god
[54:14] god the theophany came down and was made
[54:16] flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the
[54:18] man
[54:22] now that logos have come out from god
[54:24] the son of god as we call it
[54:31] was god in a theophany
[54:37] a word body
[54:39] a theophany logos speech whatever you
[54:42] want to call it
[54:44] but he stood there and he said let there
[54:45] be
[54:48] all right
[54:49] he made a good point as i was describing
[54:51] to him last night when we went to the
[54:53] passion play i'm just saying it made a
[54:54] good point
[54:56] but somebody caught something
[54:58] and you know how the passion plays begin
[55:00] they always begin in a different scene
[55:02] they don't begin the same scene every
[55:04] year and take it for narrator passion
[55:06] playing atlanta about the the
[55:07] crucifixion of christ all right
[55:11] and she's only done it one time and it
[55:13] was
[55:14] it was like that there wasn't anything
[55:16] and then all at once this man just
[55:18] stepped out
[55:20] i shout
[55:23] hallelujah
[55:25] because this man just stepped back
[55:28] and he said let there be amen
[55:31] let there be
[55:32] the world began to be formed animals
[55:34] began to be formed in all the things
[55:38] and then all at once
[55:40] it changed to where they wanted the
[55:42] scene on earth to be
[55:44] when it did a baby
[55:47] was crying
[55:48] and they started to play
[55:50] at the birth of jesus christ
[55:53] but what was thrilling to me was
[55:57] the same man that came down here
[56:00] as a young man we call him jesus
[56:04] was the same one in the play
[56:06] that was standing here that said let
[56:08] there be
[56:10] because what did jesus look like
[56:14] before the world
[56:17] theophany man
[56:19] all right what is it
[56:22] the prophet of god said what like this
[56:24] and i know i ain't gonna get through
[56:25] this message this morning that's alright
[56:27] we'll finish it this evening
[56:30] look at the next one number four on your
[56:32] notes hebrews chapter 4 chapter 2 part 3
[56:35] 57 8 28
[56:37] now the logos that went out of god which
[56:39] was the logos all this began to form
[56:42] into a body shape
[56:45] listen
[56:46] and this body with body shape was called
[56:49] in the scholars teaching logos now get
[56:52] the point of body shape
[56:59] not just a spiritual looking you know
[57:01] just a glob just
[57:03] a body shape
[57:07] why didn't we come up here looking like
[57:09] monkeys
[57:10] because god's not a monkey
[57:14] why didn't we look like a rhino
[57:16] or a hippo some of us do but
[57:19] that's around the belly
[57:22] but that doesn't have anything to do
[57:23] with it
[57:25] listen
[57:28] he made us
[57:30] in his image that's right amen so what
[57:33] kind of an image was he the prophet said
[57:34] he was a theophany
[57:36] being deformed into a body shape
[57:39] this body shape was called in the
[57:41] scholars teaching logos the logos that
[57:43] went out of god in other words a better
[57:45] word for it was a what we call a
[57:48] theophany
[57:50] now here's his definition
[57:53] theophany is a human body
[57:57] are you reading it
[57:58] that's glorified
[58:00] now watch it
[58:02] not exactly with flesh and blood
[58:05] like it will be in its glorified state
[58:09] but it is in is of a form of a human
[58:14] body that doesn't eat neither does it
[58:16] drink but it's a body a body that's
[58:19] waiting for us as soon as we leave this
[58:22] one
[58:24] and there we enter into that body that's
[58:26] the kind of body that god was for he
[58:28] said let us make man in our own image in
[58:31] our own likeness
[58:34] and see i like to cut off things before
[58:36] people get their thinking ability
[58:39] but theopny don't eat those beyond the
[58:41] curtain of time were not eating those in
[58:42] hell were not eating
[58:46] right
[58:47] neither one of those were eating all
[58:49] right
[58:50] he said well brother dale we got you
[58:52] though because look at melchizedek
[58:54] okay let's look at melchizedek
[58:59] the real melchizedek was almighty god
[59:01] right
[59:02] almighty god didn't have to eat right
[59:05] the flesh that he was in was what was
[59:07] doing the eating
[59:09] the theophany was inside of our you say
[59:11] well how do you know about that because
[59:12] that's what how else would it be
[59:16] that's what i said i mean what else
[59:18] would it be right
[59:20] inside of that body with almighty god
[59:23] is not saying that man that sat down and
[59:25] made the case was god he's saying god
[59:28] was in that land right because that body
[59:30] that jesus lived in wasn't god that's
[59:33] right it was the body god dwelled in
[59:35] that's right
[59:38] brother aaron he's
[59:40] i don't know where the world he's
[59:41] actually pray for him
[59:44] he sure missed a lot lately
[59:46] but he had a good point
[59:48] he said god just standing up there he
[59:50] remembered and he was saying okay to the
[59:52] angels he said come here uh michael come
[59:54] here gable and he went and just created
[59:56] a body and they stepped down that was
[59:57] the two that went down to sodom is that
[59:59] the way the prophet said
[1:00:01] he said then he just spoke right back
[1:00:02] out of existence
[1:00:04] but see then he stepped into a body
[1:00:07] an earthly body that come down and could
[1:00:09] eat the kite
[1:00:11] and drink the metal
[1:00:12] but inside of that was where god was at
[1:00:14] right right so your body is not your
[1:00:17] theophany
[1:00:18] right right that's not your soul that's
[1:00:20] what i'm trying to get you to see
[1:00:22] that's not the real you
[1:00:24] the real use inside of there
[1:00:27] wanting to be brought out
[1:00:29] into being
[1:00:31] all right
[1:00:32] so what did he say
[1:00:40] he goes down to number five which is the
[1:00:42] same quote out of the hebrews
[1:00:44] and he says that man
[1:00:48] was made
[1:00:49] finally in the garden
[1:00:51] in the image of the animal and given a
[1:00:53] foot like a bear and a hand like a
[1:00:55] chimpanzee etc etc
[1:00:58] made us naturally in the image of the
[1:01:00] animal
[1:01:02] all right because like i said there was
[1:01:03] a beast
[1:01:05] we wasn't made to look like the monkey
[1:01:07] now a lot of us act like it and i think
[1:01:09] some people do look like a monkey
[1:01:11] but that still don't have to undo it
[1:01:14] we can't hit what we look like
[1:01:16] you know we're just what we are
[1:01:19] all right but that was the natural part
[1:01:20] when the man was made but look at the
[1:01:22] life part of what it says there
[1:01:24] the met your body's made just the same
[1:01:27] kind of material as a horse
[1:01:29] or a dog
[1:01:30] number five on your nose or anything
[1:01:33] like that it's made out of calcium
[1:01:34] potash petroleum cosmic light you're
[1:01:37] just no all flesh like that
[1:01:39] not the same flesh because you know that
[1:01:41] paul is described as a the the flesh of
[1:01:43] a bird is the flesh of an animal that's
[1:01:45] flesh it you know all right
[1:01:47] but it's made out of the dust of the
[1:01:49] earth where it come from but the
[1:01:50] difference between an animal and a man
[1:01:53] god put a soul in a man
[1:01:56] and he didn't put it in the animal
[1:01:58] because the soul that was in the man is
[1:02:00] that theophany
[1:02:05] now
[1:02:07] so that theophany
[1:02:11] so what happened in the garden
[1:02:15] you have adam coming into being as the
[1:02:17] first human being as we call it that's
[1:02:19] why it's called the first adam
[1:02:22] all right now we were talking about last
[1:02:24] night see then jesus is called the
[1:02:26] second atom right but what he's called
[1:02:28] by paul is the second atom is meaning
[1:02:30] that he was not
[1:02:32] you know
[1:02:34] it's not secondary
[1:02:36] the second adam which is jesus christ is
[1:02:38] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:02:40] now adam was the beginning of the
[1:02:42] natural human race
[1:02:45] right the natural human race begin
[1:02:48] with adam and i do not believe
[1:02:51] that there were more people made
[1:02:53] than adam
[1:02:55] they made eve from adam
[1:02:57] but not more people made now and i'll go
[1:03:00] back to the bible did there is doctrines
[1:03:03] that there were other people made and
[1:03:05] where did cain get his wife and what
[1:03:07] happened here he married his sister that
[1:03:09] sensible plain language hundreds of
[1:03:11] years before he left there
[1:03:14] all right
[1:03:16] but you see
[1:03:17] they say that there was more people made
[1:03:19] now according to my bible now
[1:03:22] right
[1:03:23] the bible says that
[1:03:26] eve is the mother of all living right so
[1:03:29] if there's any monkeys in outer space
[1:03:31] running around up there on these planets
[1:03:33] that you're going to call
[1:03:35] exterestoral beings they come from this
[1:03:37] earth
[1:03:41] because
[1:03:42] eve was the mother of all living now
[1:03:44] that's blunt that's i don't even argue
[1:03:46] with nobody about it
[1:03:48] see i argued this before ever coming
[1:03:50] this message because i knew i had a
[1:03:51] little sense
[1:03:54] i told you i run into a man that
[1:03:55] believed that
[1:03:57] before i come in this message to believe
[1:03:58] that a person didn't even have a soul
[1:04:01] boy he was laying it out there at work
[1:04:02] and he had these books laid out and he
[1:04:04] was laying out all these things you know
[1:04:06] i didn't argue with him in front of
[1:04:07] nobody i just waited till it's over
[1:04:10] and i said you don't believe man had a
[1:04:11] soul until the law came he said no he
[1:04:14] didn't i said well according to my bible
[1:04:18] in genesis there it said god breathed
[1:04:20] into the nostrils of adam and he become
[1:04:22] a living soul
[1:04:24] right he said i never thought oh my
[1:04:28] goodness
[1:04:29] you got a whole lot of books proven
[1:04:31] everything else but never thought about
[1:04:32] the bible
[1:04:38] you're a unit you've got to have body
[1:04:39] spirit soul
[1:04:42] to make you a unit that's right
[1:04:44] the
[1:04:45] law came to bring us some knowledge of
[1:04:47] sin
[1:04:48] right right
[1:04:51] it became as the prophet said allah
[1:04:54] to tell you don't do this right cause
[1:04:57] the conscious part of man is made as i
[1:04:59] was trying to say a while ago every
[1:05:01] person in the world you go to africa you
[1:05:04] go to the to the far region to the north
[1:05:06] you go and they're worshiping right
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:10] totem poles images of animals any kind
[1:05:12] of a thing why because that soul within
[1:05:14] that
[1:05:16] even though it knows nothing about what
[1:05:18] we talk about god in jesus christ but
[1:05:20] yet it's wanting to serve god
[1:05:22] amen
[1:05:23] and you won't talk about sincerity take
[1:05:26] one of your babies and feed it to an
[1:05:27] alligator
[1:05:29] that's why you don't argue with me about
[1:05:31] things
[1:05:32] i know i'm blunt
[1:05:34] we don't talk about to me oh but brother
[1:05:37] dale i'm sincere
[1:05:39] you remember the prophet said you'd be
[1:05:41] sincerely wrong
[1:05:43] oh i love god he said you love god with
[1:05:46] your spirit
[1:05:49] anointed ones beat us to death about the
[1:05:51] love
[1:05:52] they're out there feeding the world and
[1:05:53] we're sitting here with our bellies
[1:05:55] being fat
[1:05:57] all right
[1:05:59] but now listen
[1:06:03] that man
[1:06:06] that he put in the garden
[1:06:08] what happened to that man
[1:06:13] all right now i proved it to you and
[1:06:14] it's in the nose there i'll get back to
[1:06:16] it to see we don't read word
[1:06:19] that god came down in the form of a
[1:06:22] bodily form
[1:06:24] and he uses the word immorphy on who is
[1:06:26] this melchizedek and it's in the notes
[1:06:28] we'll get to it to see
[1:06:30] that god came down in an amorphy body
[1:06:36] but he said we bypassed that
[1:06:43] he said because we come into the world
[1:06:45] to be tempted of sin
[1:06:47] amen but he said we returned to that
[1:06:50] here
[1:06:52] but you see god was in a full form word
[1:06:56] body standing there and said let there
[1:06:57] be let there be
[1:07:00] all right
[1:07:02] but now what happened here he comes and
[1:07:03] he creates a man in the image of that
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:08] 126 he creates a man in the image of
[1:07:10] that
[1:07:12] now we get to it this evening it wasn't
[1:07:14] just
[1:07:14] adam that was created there it was all
[1:07:17] that will ever be born again is created
[1:07:19] there
[1:07:20] that's right
[1:07:21] we'll get back to that
[1:07:23] but here he is in the garden what
[1:07:25] happened
[1:07:27] did all of that man that we see standing
[1:07:29] there the logos that theophany that said
[1:07:31] let there be did it step into adam
[1:07:35] no
[1:07:37] it did you got a problem
[1:07:40] you got a problem
[1:07:43] no
[1:07:45] because there's no way that man could
[1:07:47] fall
[1:07:50] but see a part of god
[1:07:54] was placed into heaven
[1:07:56] amen
[1:07:58] because when you get the new birth you
[1:08:00] don't get
[1:08:01] all of god and nobody else ain't got no
[1:08:03] opportunity to be saved
[1:08:06] but you get a part of god
[1:08:08] by the new birth which is the soul of
[1:08:10] almighty god which is eternal life which
[1:08:12] is all of god
[1:08:16] but not the all of god like that right
[1:08:21] we are little gods but you know we're
[1:08:22] not the god of the heavens
[1:08:24] that's right
[1:08:27] our universe is down here
[1:08:30] right are you listening
[1:08:33] but he said let us make man
[1:08:36] so here was adam
[1:08:40] his spiritual being
[1:08:42] created
[1:08:44] his soul
[1:08:45] is being
[1:08:48] it's the obvious
[1:08:50] but i believe they gave you the hebrew
[1:08:52] good
[1:08:53] i believe your soul is your theophany
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:56] i believe even in a lost estate
[1:09:00] that your soul is the real you
[1:09:03] amen
[1:09:12] but you see
[1:09:13] like i said now how you gonna know what
[1:09:15] the new birth is if you don't even know
[1:09:16] what you are right right
[1:09:19] where is the new birth is it in your
[1:09:20] body
[1:09:21] is it in your spirit is it in your soul
[1:09:26] i was talking to a man one night about
[1:09:28] it he said oh i come here with this
[1:09:30] eternal seed inside of me i said where
[1:09:32] was the day
[1:09:34] was it in your body was it in your
[1:09:36] spirit was in your soul he said i ain't
[1:09:37] gonna answer you because you better try
[1:09:39] to answer that
[1:09:42] he was smart he's a lawyer he real
[1:09:44] longer he knew
[1:09:46] he knew that if he said neither one he's
[1:09:48] gonna track himself
[1:09:50] so he said i'm not gonna answer you
[1:09:53] i said no you're not gonna answer
[1:09:54] because you don't know where it's at
[1:09:58] but you see
[1:10:00] when adam was placed in the garden
[1:10:04] remember
[1:10:06] when the animals were made
[1:10:09] adam the theophany man was there to rule
[1:10:11] them
[1:10:16] because his soul was created before the
[1:10:17] foundation of the world his theophany
[1:10:19] his being
[1:10:21] but then it was only a part of god that
[1:10:23] was put in adam
[1:10:25] now here's the theory of mankind
[1:10:27] that
[1:10:29] you watch it and you'd say well there's
[1:10:30] adam he's body spirit and soul
[1:10:33] so you say well let's give him a body
[1:10:34] and i see you give him a spirit and then
[1:10:36] god put his own soul in there that'd
[1:10:37] make him god
[1:10:40] he wouldn't be happy
[1:10:44] right right
[1:10:46] it wouldn't be
[1:10:47] he'd be god
[1:10:48] that's sensible
[1:10:50] you need a light bulb turned on
[1:10:52] no it's sensible
[1:10:54] i feel i like to talk sensible
[1:10:57] to me the bible's the only thing that's
[1:10:59] sensual this message is the only thing
[1:11:01] that is simple
[1:11:02] ain't nothing else sensible
[1:11:05] ain't nothing else you can't poke holes
[1:11:07] in
[1:11:09] i don't care who's theories or whatever
[1:11:11] but you can't poke them in this message
[1:11:13] that's right well i've run around
[1:11:14] contradicting yourself you're coming
[1:11:16] come on bring it
[1:11:18] i'll pay you away here
[1:11:20] and let's sit down and talk about it
[1:11:22] that's right
[1:11:23] because if brother branham's message now
[1:11:25] i know where he made mistakes when he's
[1:11:27] talking about the white horse rider
[1:11:29] sure we know that because god had not
[1:11:31] opened the word unto him and nobody
[1:11:34] could correct him on it that's right i
[1:11:36] don't care if clarence larkin talked to
[1:11:38] my horse rider was the antichrist before
[1:11:40] brother brown ever come along
[1:11:43] but that didn't make clark larkin a
[1:11:45] prophet
[1:11:49] but listen
[1:11:51] adam's standing in the garden then
[1:11:53] finally was created a natural man in
[1:11:55] genesis 2.
[1:11:58] and when he did god placed that
[1:12:01] into adam
[1:12:03] so adam was my body spirit and soul read
[1:12:05] blasphemous names
[1:12:08] he was made body spirit and soul as
[1:12:10] heaven standing there
[1:12:13] his soul
[1:12:16] was a creation
[1:12:18] it was not eternal
[1:12:21] it was a creation
[1:12:23] but then god breathed into his nostrils
[1:12:25] and he became brother brown says 27 28
[1:12:28] of blasphemous names he said he became
[1:12:30] an eternal
[1:12:32] person
[1:12:35] adam had eternal life in his soul
[1:12:37] because he had the life of god
[1:12:39] now i'll get there just we'll back up
[1:12:41] this evening because you see that's what
[1:12:43] god wants right
[1:12:45] adam in the garden was what god wanted
[1:12:48] that's right
[1:12:50] now listen to what i'm saying
[1:12:53] if you don't like it forget it
[1:12:56] adam and eve in the garden was not what
[1:12:58] god wanted
[1:13:02] you say yes he does that's okay you've
[1:13:04] got a point now but hold the point
[1:13:07] because once eve was pulled out of adam
[1:13:12] and placed in a human body
[1:13:14] she was subject to fall
[1:13:23] i don't want to go back to the garden
[1:13:25] people say we want to get back to the
[1:13:27] garden no i don't want to go back garden
[1:13:28] because we'll go back garden and fall
[1:13:30] again
[1:13:32] i don't care what you think about you
[1:13:34] can't fall
[1:13:35] i don't believe you can fall from
[1:13:36] eternal life no way in the world can you
[1:13:38] fall from eternal life well the prophet
[1:13:40] said on the seal book that adam and eve
[1:13:41] felt from eternal life will you explain
[1:13:43] how he fell from it when the prophet
[1:13:45] said god's not an ending giver he don't
[1:13:47] give you eternal life to take it back
[1:13:49] what's he talking about adam and eve was
[1:13:52] supposed to come forth and finally
[1:13:54] become eternal embodied because adam's
[1:13:57] body had a beginning and having a
[1:13:58] beginning it was not eternal
[1:14:00] right that's right but if he had not
[1:14:02] fallen he would have become eternal
[1:14:05] because the tree of life was in the
[1:14:06] garden for him to eat off of
[1:14:08] hey come on the tree of life is this
[1:14:10] word
[1:14:11] the tree of life is the word of god
[1:14:13] which is jesus christ in word foreign
[1:14:15] that's what we're doing now eating our
[1:14:16] way back to prophecy
[1:14:19] we're eating our way to eternity just
[1:14:21] keep eating on the inside man and then
[1:14:24] let's keep pushing out the outside man
[1:14:26] till one day it'll change his man amen
[1:14:29] and make this man you're looking at
[1:14:31] eternal that's right
[1:14:33] then i don't have to worry about it
[1:14:36] can't fall once you get there because
[1:14:37] adam's body was not eternal
[1:14:42] hey i want to get back into the side of
[1:14:44] adam i don't want to get in the side of
[1:14:46] the church
[1:14:47] come on you forgive me now for saying it
[1:14:49] that way i don't want to get in the side
[1:14:51] of eve
[1:14:52] because he's the church the church is
[1:14:54] what's messed us up
[1:14:56] church is what's taught us wrong the
[1:14:58] church of this message is what's
[1:14:59] teaching the people wrong
[1:15:04] but it's like we said last night and the
[1:15:06] father talking about the five full
[1:15:07] ministry
[1:15:10] brother ryan said if your pastor won't
[1:15:12] stay with the truth get away from me
[1:15:17] oh but brother dale i've got to go here
[1:15:21] i've got to go there and they're
[1:15:24] wonderful sweet people where your soul
[1:15:26] is at stake so go ahead and do it
[1:15:29] he said you won't die take a fly and get
[1:15:31] it let a fly fall down in your soup and
[1:15:33] then you take the fly out and eat the
[1:15:35] soup
[1:15:36] right you won't do it
[1:15:39] but yet you'll swallow down the most
[1:15:41] garbage cans of all of the message of
[1:15:42] the hour and just keep right on going
[1:15:45] he said what are you trying to do give
[1:15:47] us all to move to lulu i don't want you
[1:15:48] in lulu if god don't want you in lulu
[1:15:52] i told my son-in-law when he was talking
[1:15:54] and marrying my daughter
[1:15:56] i told him i said i don't want you in
[1:15:58] lulu because you're my son-in-law
[1:16:01] and that's true i said i want you in
[1:16:02] lulu because of the word
[1:16:05] you come because of the word everything
[1:16:06] else will be fine
[1:16:11] i'm not trying to build up and try to
[1:16:12] face it but there's one thing about it
[1:16:14] like we talked about life's nighty gay
[1:16:16] song
[1:16:17] where did you come from to get here
[1:16:20] why did you come from other places to
[1:16:23] get here that's right
[1:16:26] exactly right
[1:16:27] come on
[1:16:29] i told plane why did you come
[1:16:31] you wouldn't brother dale without
[1:16:33] for trying to get you here that's right
[1:16:35] or offering you a couple of you know
[1:16:37] free meals to get you to come in
[1:16:39] but i like what brother whitney used to
[1:16:41] say if you get them in with a hot dog
[1:16:42] you can get them out with a hamburger
[1:16:45] right
[1:16:47] you get them here because you beg them
[1:16:48] to come and then turn around and they
[1:16:50] leave they'll take people with them
[1:16:53] that's right
[1:16:54] that's right let them come and hear the
[1:16:55] word
[1:16:58] then you say he gave us this that's and
[1:17:01] we honor it
[1:17:03] all right
[1:17:05] but you see adam
[1:17:07] god only put part into adam
[1:17:10] he said how can you describe that
[1:17:13] well there was a man named moses one
[1:17:15] time
[1:17:16] and his father-in-law said you're taking
[1:17:18] too much on yourself you're gonna kill
[1:17:20] yourself wearing out like you are
[1:17:22] he said pick you out some men and said
[1:17:24] support them for the job
[1:17:27] not only did he put him out in the point
[1:17:29] of the job you know what god done god
[1:17:31] took the spirit off of moses and put it
[1:17:32] on the 70.
[1:17:35] right
[1:17:36] remember how many it was back here and
[1:17:38] put it on
[1:17:39] you know what brother said he said never
[1:17:41] left moses with no less spirit now you
[1:17:43] explain that
[1:17:45] right
[1:17:47] brother harris always enjoyed that point
[1:17:49] he had to make he said satan or left
[1:17:51] jesus alone because he's only facing one
[1:17:53] christ
[1:17:56] amen but when he killed him there was
[1:17:59] 120 at the first whack
[1:18:02] he'd been better off went on vacation
[1:18:04] left him alone
[1:18:06] right that's right but he can't do it
[1:18:09] right
[1:18:09] but the more pressure he puts on and the
[1:18:11] more he kills the more god will bring
[1:18:13] out
[1:18:14] because it's spiritual multiplication
[1:18:17] that's the part i'm talking about
[1:18:18] brother said we have a part of god how
[1:18:21] did he describe the part of god he said
[1:18:23] a spoonful of water out of the ocean
[1:18:28] he said in volume
[1:18:31] in volume it's not the same but he said
[1:18:34] in quality
[1:18:37] the spoonful is the same elements as the
[1:18:40] whole ocean
[1:18:43] he said that holy ghost i was looking at
[1:18:44] this morning
[1:18:46] three o'clock he said that holy ghost
[1:18:50] will be given out one day
[1:18:52] and say what it is
[1:18:54] it'll all be old
[1:18:57] it's the same holy ghost
[1:19:00] but adam was what god wanted
[1:19:03] that's what he wants every child to look
[1:19:05] like
[1:19:06] and to be like that's right
[1:19:08] but you know what i loved our
[1:19:10] adam had nothing to do with receiving
[1:19:12] eternal life
[1:19:15] come on
[1:19:16] god imparted to adam
[1:19:19] eternal life
[1:19:21] he had nothing to do with it
[1:19:23] but you do
[1:19:25] because you've got to submit yourselves
[1:19:27] and become the place of being justified
[1:19:30] sanctify and fill with the holy ghost to
