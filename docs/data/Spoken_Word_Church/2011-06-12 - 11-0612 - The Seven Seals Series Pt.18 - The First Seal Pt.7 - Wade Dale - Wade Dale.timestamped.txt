[0:06] all right good morning everyone
[0:11] good to be back trying to get this thing
[0:13] started
[0:14] good to be
[0:28] all right
[0:30] okay we got burley's camp coming up in
[0:32] another maybe
[0:35] five or six weeks so we need to start
[0:37] getting their
[0:38] ducks in a row for it
[0:40] and for those of you that are going
[0:41] camping this weekend with the brothers
[0:44] we need to meet after a second service
[0:47] somewhere when all these women get out
[0:48] of here
[0:51] praise the lord
[0:58] when they all get out of here we'll have
[0:59] a meeting about what we need to get and
[1:01] bring and
[1:02] why did you tell them where to put them
[1:06] what would you put the sign she said
[1:09] that's already uh
[1:21] let's turn revelation 6 and get started
[1:23] yeah
[1:24] life sounds like a mountain biker
[1:28] i am a whole bunch
[1:30] of airplanes
[1:38] they don't want that sign so whatever we
[1:40] want to do with it
[1:42] dick does not want that sign so whatever
[1:44] we want to do with it
[1:50] yeah these signs are vinyl both to last
[1:53] over 10 years or 10 years guaranteed 10
[1:55] years
[1:58] no fading or peeling or cracking
[2:02] we'll say
[2:03] i hope we don't have to find out 10
[2:05] years from now
[2:24] all right revelation six verse one
[2:27] all right
[2:28] where's sadie
[2:32] what's remember susie's name
[2:34] all right
[2:36] now we spoke
[2:38] last wednesday
[2:40] on the
[2:43] part of iniquity where we were going
[2:44] through the
[2:46] buddha seal food seal number
[2:48] one gotta gonna kind of recap a little
[2:51] this morning
[2:53] uh i want you to start reading the
[2:54] second seal
[2:56] the first seal is
[3:01] showing the mystery of iniquity or the
[3:04] man of sin
[3:08] but the whole point of the first seal to
[3:11] me is
[3:14] if we don't have a true revelation of
[3:15] one god
[3:17] then the first seal will not break
[3:20] because without that first seal i was
[3:22] preaching out in oklahoma this past
[3:24] weekend and
[3:25] they kind of got
[3:28] the idea that i said the first seal was
[3:30] the very most important one well we all
[3:32] know the seventh seal the important one
[3:34] the most important because it's christ
[3:36] right without him being on the scene the
[3:38] first seal won't open but without the
[3:40] first seal opening the second seal would
[3:42] have opened right what brother brown
[3:44] said he said i don't know what that
[3:45] second seal is but once that first seal
[3:48] opened to that prophet it was easier for
[3:50] him to say hey i'm not going on my notes
[3:52] anymore because i was fixing to go on my
[3:54] note my old notes
[3:56] my old notes were that the white horse
[3:58] rider was the holy ghost and then he
[4:00] would have preached that man all the way
[4:02] through the fourth seal as the holy
[4:04] ghost
[4:05] does everybody understand that
[4:07] okay so very important that first seal
[4:09] was so important
[4:11] that god let that prophet come right to
[4:13] a you know like the day before at 12
[4:16] o'clock or the day of at 12 o'clock
[4:19] he said he said i've made a horrible
[4:20] mistake
[4:22] if the if the angel of the lord had to
[4:24] come in the room at 12 o'clock
[4:26] and straightened me out on this well
[4:28] from 12 o'clock when they had the
[4:29] service that was getting pretty close
[4:31] so i'm sure he had to tear all those
[4:33] notes up and start over again
[4:35] and the lord just started revealing
[4:36] things to him
[4:38] showing
[4:40] the
[4:41] i don't like and i know the bible says
[4:43] it revealed the wicked one but i don't
[4:45] like to reveal the devil
[4:47] because if you'll reveal jesus christ
[4:49] satan will be exposed we want to expose
[4:52] that man right we want to and truly
[4:55] reveal means to make known plus it will
[4:57] do that it will make that
[4:58] there's two things going to be made
[5:00] known in the end town christ and the
[5:01] antichrist
[5:03] no in between no you know
[5:06] you know let's just get down to brass
[5:08] tacks that's all that matters
[5:12] this man the the antichrist has been so
[5:15] close to jesus christ until he's almost
[5:18] deceived the very elect
[5:20] he's basically
[5:23] let's just be honest
[5:25] those people that baptized in father son
[5:27] holy ghost baptism
[5:29] god was winking at their ignorance
[5:32] and allowing that to happen but now
[5:34] god don't change his mind about his word
[5:38] matthew 20 whatever that matthew um
[5:43] whatever it is 22 or 24 or 27 therefore
[5:47] he says baptize in the name of the
[5:48] father and of the son of the holy god
[5:53] did god change his mind and say father
[5:55] son holy ghost is it
[5:58] no
[6:00] man changed his mind and he allowed
[6:02] satan so close
[6:07] he didn't accept that but he allowed it
[6:09] brother said god winked at our ignorance
[6:12] the ignorance of the people in the
[6:13] pulpit
[6:15] right right because god reveals it to
[6:17] the minister first whether you like it
[6:19] or not that's right he revealed it to
[6:20] the minister first and then you get it
[6:22] he gets the big loaf like jesus did on
[6:24] the there on the shores of galilee he
[6:26] got the big loaf
[6:28] and then he started tearing off loaves
[6:30] and handing loaves to the people he did
[6:32] not handle those to the people
[6:34] he handed the loaves to the twelve
[6:36] that's right
[6:37] and they distribute it to the people
[6:39] and one of them was the devil
[6:43] god always remember judas was there
[6:44] that's right
[6:46] he handed out the bread the same bread
[6:47] that jesus broke he handed it out
[6:51] so you got to be careful of that man of
[6:53] sin that's why that man of sin was so
[6:55] deceptive
[6:56] he was sitting right there so close
[7:00] until he was almost ready to deceive a
[7:02] prophet but you can't deceive a prophet
[7:05] you can you can keep you can be in
[7:07] deception
[7:08] but somewhere it's going to be made
[7:10] known because god's got a perfect will
[7:12] his perfect will was father son holy
[7:14] ghost baptism is not right three gods
[7:17] or trinity of doctrine is not right
[7:19] all right so somewhere
[7:21] somehow
[7:23] that got eat down and we we were
[7:26] talking about it by the cloud now and
[7:28] then not seeing council in there that's
[7:30] that's where it really happened because
[7:32] you had the faith of the fathers
[7:34] you had first three ages
[7:37] the the first three ages
[7:39] parallels were the first seal right
[7:41] first seal in the first three ages we'll
[7:43] wrap that up probably next sunday
[7:45] but the first seal
[7:48] parallels the first three ages all right
[7:50] or compares with the first three ages
[7:52] because that was the lion spirit l-i-o-n
[7:55] lion that went out the bowl paul peter
[7:58] james and john all those that wrote the
[7:59] bible all those that were in the early
[8:01] church did not have a father-son holy
[8:03] ghost baptism to deal with they didn't
[8:04] have three gods to deal with
[8:07] they believed in one true living god
[8:09] they believed in water baptism in that
[8:10] lord jesus christ but 606 it's kind of
[8:13] ironic that that was when the last night
[8:15] seeing council was in 606 a.d
[8:19] and that's when the third church ended
[8:22] according to brother brown of course we
[8:23] know there's a lap over but brother do
[8:24] you look in your church age book 606 a.d
[8:27] is when the third age ended
[8:31] what happened in 606 a.d
[8:33] they took
[8:34] on the father son holy ghost baptism and
[8:37] jesus being a like substance of god not
[8:39] the substance of god
[8:41] so therefore they set up the trinity
[8:44] they start to worship the virgin mary
[8:47] and all those things see all that
[8:48] evolved
[8:49] remember god doesn't just dump
[8:51] everything on you and satan doesn't
[8:52] either he's wise
[8:55] so he started in that in that first
[8:56] three ages he he started as a saint
[9:01] well is was that man jesus or was he the
[9:04] same was he god or was he just like god
[9:06] or did god send the son
[9:09] satan got into the ministers of the hour
[9:12] right
[9:15] brother brown said true prophets went to
[9:18] nicaea he said they should have stayed
[9:20] away from it
[9:22] but they went to nicaea and to make a
[9:24] long story short they got sucked in on
[9:25] some of the doctrine
[9:27] and when they got sucked in on some of
[9:28] the doctrine they started going well
[9:31] so saying if he ever puts a question in
[9:32] your mind
[9:34] see
[9:35] then you start
[9:37] dealing with that question that's right
[9:39] and then he goes over here and gets in
[9:40] this other brother and his other brother
[9:42] when you get he see remember power was
[9:44] given
[9:46] he got straight from what to people
[9:49] the people started their little saying
[9:53] remember it was a saying
[9:54] a d
[9:56] doctrine
[9:57] it goes all the way up we'll get into
[9:59] that in a little while
[10:01] but
[10:02] at that 606 council you got constantine
[10:05] you got all these people that come in
[10:06] you got you got a pope
[10:08] actually that doctrine became crowned
[10:12] remember they put you can't put a crown
[10:13] on the spirit it says the crown was
[10:15] given
[10:17] what a crown was given to a flesh person
[10:20] satan started his ride just like god
[10:22] started his ride through jesus christ
[10:25] the holy one of israel one only one of
[10:28] israel
[10:29] all right and then satan started his
[10:31] ride because we read a couple of sundays
[10:33] ago paul said grievous wolves will come
[10:36] in now and not spare the flop
[10:39] but remember what paul said
[10:41] and we read this that
[10:43] in oklahoma they never really read it
[10:44] that way paul said and even in my
[10:48] congregation in other words
[10:51] right
[10:52] even in my congregation
[10:56] it's where it's going to be
[10:58] and he said in yourselves in other words
[11:00] you're the one that's going to do it
[11:02] grievous wolves are not only going to
[11:03] just come in it's going to start among
[11:05] you
[11:07] and then john which went to the isle of
[11:09] patmos after paul was killed john goes
[11:12] to the isle of patmos comes back and he
[11:13] sees that man of sin that person
[11:16] standing there with a triple crown on
[11:17] his head the pope
[11:19] and
[11:20] read in the bible he said let's see if
[11:23] we can find that revelations
[11:27] 18 i think it is
[11:29] something there
[11:31] john
[11:34] admired
[11:38] verse 6
[11:40] chapter 17 verse 6.
[11:44] now this is john
[11:46] the revelator
[11:48] remember the sermon i preached not too
[11:50] long ago how long was he born again
[11:52] 60 years
[11:54] this man was a sage
[11:57] he was a prophet
[11:59] not a prophet like an end like a a
[12:01] church age prophet but he was the
[12:02] prophet because the word of the lord
[12:03] came to it
[12:04] he was a prophet john was on the isle of
[12:07] patmos to write everything down that he
[12:08] saw he'd been born again for 60 years he
[12:11] was at the faith of the fathers he was
[12:13] up there had all those virtues working
[12:15] in his life
[12:17] wow pretty good guy huh
[12:19] didn't have a father-son holy ghost
[12:20] baptism to deal with satan couldn't
[12:22] fight him on that he didn't have a three
[12:24] gods to deal with he didn't fight him on
[12:26] that but listen to what he said right
[12:27] here
[12:30] verse six and i saw the woman drunken
[12:34] with the blood of the saints and with
[12:36] the blood of the martyrs of jesus and
[12:37] when i saw her
[12:39] i wondered with great
[12:42] admiration
[12:45] the original is wonder
[12:47] and you can go all the way
[12:49] so if you admire something you've almost
[12:52] fell into lust
[12:54] great admiration
[12:58] donnie and i go to the bass pro shop
[13:02] we see this
[13:03] 3 000 dollar
[13:06] over and under shotgun that just fits us
[13:08] perfect
[13:11] we're not only admiring it we're wanting
[13:13] it
[13:14] you understand one thing
[13:16] we're not only admiring it we're wanting
[13:18] it now john didn't because he was born
[13:20] again he didn't want it but look how
[13:21] close this thing was john
[13:24] i believe john in his own person this
[13:26] i'm just
[13:27] you know throwing this out john with his
[13:29] own in his own mind he said how can this
[13:31] be so evil and be so beautiful
[13:38] she looks good yeah sure
[13:41] but he saw all this i remember what he
[13:43] wrote down you read verse one two three
[13:45] four five
[13:46] man by the time we get to number five
[13:48] down here if you'll read that
[13:50] we'll know on this side
[13:53] on this side of that writing that she
[13:55] was a horn
[13:56] she was the most vile creature on the
[13:58] face of the earth
[13:59] she had destroyed saints by the
[14:02] billions
[14:04] and john's still admired
[14:07] because she was beautiful
[14:11] he said i'm sure i'm sure john said in
[14:13] his human self he said how can that be
[14:15] so evil
[14:17] be so beautiful and be so
[14:19] evil
[14:22] but that was the white horse rider
[14:25] writing
[14:27] he was right there on isle of patmos
[14:28] come on the devil wasn't boy the devil
[14:31] didn't leave john alone
[14:33] i don't think he don't leave me and you
[14:35] alone doesn't he
[14:37] he'll leave john alone he's playing with
[14:39] john's mind but john knew with the holy
[14:41] spirit we've got to know john you by the
[14:42] holy spirit what he was pinning was
[14:45] right whether or how he felt
[14:49] see
[14:51] because the man of sin is is full of
[14:53] lust and all these things iniquity and
[14:55] all that what is that that deals with
[14:56] this
[14:57] fleshly thing
[14:59] it deals with the flesh
[15:01] john admired it because his his senses
[15:04] looked at that woman and said how can
[15:05] this woman be so beautiful
[15:07] and be so evil
[15:09] but it was but man you read the rest of
[15:11] that i mean she's got uh
[15:14] um
[15:15] she's got was like i said the blood of
[15:17] all the saints
[15:19] see john had to be thinking because
[15:21] remember he was the only one he was the
[15:23] only one that was alive
[15:25] that he knew of
[15:28] john i mean uh paul had been killed he
[15:30] knew that
[15:31] peter had been killed hung upside down
[15:32] on the cross
[15:33] james had been run through with a spear
[15:38] matthew and bartholomew some of them
[15:40] went to um
[15:42] uh one of them went to india and they
[15:44] drug him through the streets and killed
[15:45] him see john knew all these things he
[15:46] knew the blood of those martyrs those
[15:48] saints
[15:50] was in that woman's hand but yet he
[15:51] still admired it
[15:53] you see how close this is that's like we
[15:54] were talking about this weekend
[15:57] it's going to be just a little small
[15:59] group of people
[16:01] that's going to really understand
[16:04] what this woman is saying man of sin of
[16:06] course she's portrayed as a woman
[16:08] because she's a church
[16:09] but it's satan behind them
[16:11] doing the work all right
[16:19] all right let's read that
[16:21] 7 and the angel said unto me wherefore
[16:24] didest thou
[16:25] marvel
[16:28] i will tell thee the mystery of the
[16:30] woman and of the beast that carrying her
[16:32] which has seven heads
[16:34] and ten horns and then he shows that
[16:35] what is that
[16:38] that's all the beast coming up
[16:41] all the powers
[16:42] the beast that that sauce was and it is
[16:44] not shove his hand out of the bottom of
[16:46] his bed and go into perdition then it
[16:48] keeps on going
[16:52] to verse nine the seven heads are seven
[16:55] mountains which the woman sitted now
[16:56] there's only two places in the world
[16:58] that there's seven hills and roamed one
[17:00] of them
[17:01] so he was talking about the pokemon are
[17:04] there not just rome the physical city
[17:07] it's not just
[17:08] it's not just rome italy is evil
[17:11] gangs where georgia's not evil the city
[17:14] it's the people in the city that's evil
[17:16] okay are good you know our good good our
[17:19] evil
[17:20] but back to this he admired this great
[17:23] person this great woman this great
[17:25] church he admired him
[17:27] so but that great church at that time
[17:28] said here is 1896
[17:31] by 80 by 303 or somewhere in there when
[17:34] they had the person i see in council
[17:35] watch what had happened
[17:37] satan had got in and started putting
[17:39] little sayings
[17:41] you couldn't see this man of sin
[17:44] he was just working as a spirit the
[17:46] prophet said because you can't crown a
[17:48] spirit but he had to start working
[17:49] somewhere in baby form he was working
[17:50] through the people
[17:52] but then in 606 after the third age
[17:54] ended and you started into the fourth
[17:56] age
[17:57] which was what your red horse
[18:00] there was a man standing there that they
[18:02] could put a crown on and say this is the
[18:04] biker
[18:06] instead of
[18:07] god
[18:09] see
[18:10] so that spirit had become something that
[18:12] they could crown now let's go back to
[18:15] revelation
[18:16] 6.
[18:19] and i saw when the lamb opened one of
[18:21] the seals i heard as were the noise of
[18:23] thunder
[18:24] one of the four beasts saying come and
[18:26] see now that was the lion l i owe him
[18:29] and i saw him behold a wild horse and he
[18:30] that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[18:32] was given unto him and he went for
[18:34] conquering
[18:36] and to conquer
[18:38] all right that seal ends there
[18:40] conquering in the conqueror but remember
[18:43] one is just a step for the next one
[18:46] all right one seal
[18:48] makes a step for the next one to
[18:50] open up all right
[18:52] so this one ended with finally they got
[18:54] a man standing there
[18:57] a man
[18:59] robed
[19:00] crown
[19:01] power
[19:04] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[19:07] you'll read back in the old time the
[19:09] reason they did the killing in the
[19:10] fourth age was because of what happened
[19:13] in that third age when they had that
[19:14] council in 606 they said hey this is law
[19:18] we're going to start worshiping mary
[19:19] we're going to start doing novenias
[19:21] we're going to start doing this we're
[19:22] going to start praying to dead saints
[19:25] all this evolves from that
[19:27] we see it now we go that's so stupid
[19:30] but remember in 606 a.d the people were
[19:32] ignorant to certain things
[19:34] they didn't have television and cds and
[19:37] dvds and
[19:38] and message preachers
[19:41] they did have their message preachers
[19:42] but they were local assemblies and they
[19:44] couldn't get tied together what is
[19:46] satan's greatest
[19:48] greatest
[19:49] greatest
[19:52] way to get
[19:54] you and i away from god
[19:58] when the pope comes out
[20:00] this ain't victory to the pope
[20:02] this is divide and conquer
[20:06] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[20:07] in other words he started dividing the
[20:09] people into denominations
[20:12] ideas
[20:14] that's that's satan's greatest brother
[20:16] branham said oh if the bride could come
[20:18] together
[20:20] under one
[20:22] thought one you were not going to have
[20:24] the same thought but you know this is to
[20:25] me this is the thought the message of
[20:27] the hour is the thoughts of god right
[20:28] that was the pure thoughts of god all
[20:30] that father son holy ghost and all that
[20:32] three gods and all that mary and worship
[20:34] and all that stuff that's not god
[20:37] god allowed that to happen
[20:39] and actually work through that john
[20:41] wesley was father from holy ghost
[20:42] baptism
[20:44] martin luther you know come out of the
[20:46] catholic church franklin and all that
[20:47] stuff but he went back to the to the
[20:50] basis of the bible that the just shall
[20:52] live by faith
[20:53] not by not by praying to mary not by
[20:56] just like dad was talking about and the
[20:58] people in the message it kind of flips
[20:59] their brain because brother brown says
[21:01] wesley started restoration i mean i'm
[21:04] sorry reformation
[21:06] he was a reformer that's why they say
[21:08] lutheran won't make it and wesley won't
[21:10] make it because they were reformers
[21:12] they were reformers but the message they
[21:15] brought was restoring the faith back to
[21:19] where it used to be
[21:20] so it was doing a work of restoration
[21:24] in reformation did everybody understand
[21:26] that he made that comment wednesday
[21:27] night i hope everybody understood that
[21:29] he's not contrary to the prophet now i'm
[21:31] not conquering the prophet the prophet
[21:32] said they started a reformation what
[21:34] they started reforming
[21:37] the people right
[21:38] but god inside that started a work of
[21:41] restoration because the holy ghost can't
[21:43] be reformed right
[21:46] the holy ghost only restores right he
[21:49] don't reform nothing that's alcoholics
[21:51] anonymous that's trying to do good
[21:53] that's why wesley said don't drink tea
[21:55] it has no
[21:56] value so they quit drinking tea well see
[21:59] he was in a little bit in the flesh
[22:01] but the holy ghost inside of him was
[22:03] teaching
[22:04] clean your life up
[22:07] but wesley didn't catch the whole
[22:08] revelation
[22:09] everybody understand my little
[22:10] illustration i'll tell you again this is
[22:12] you know god god winks in our ignorance
[22:14] right what does winking do it turns one
[22:16] eye
[22:17] when you wink at something you can't see
[22:19] over here god winked at our ignorance
[22:21] because god started in the days of
[22:23] luther
[22:25] and this is all that man could see this
[22:27] is all the light that man could see
[22:29] see i can do this and all i see is
[22:31] brother tim when he was really happy
[22:32] with martin luther and joe show that my
[22:34] faith but that didn't mean that this
[22:36] room wasn't here
[22:39] see that didn't mean that god's word was
[22:40] already in works
[22:42] but right here is all we can see
[22:45] now what if we broaden the revelation oh
[22:48] now i see brent anderson i see
[22:51] whatever her name is can't remember it
[22:52] now but i see three people now
[22:55] now were they sitting there when i was
[22:56] doing this
[22:58] yes but if i walked in the room and only
[23:00] could see that i'd say well that's only
[23:02] one person the just shall live by faith
[23:04] you understand what i'm saying there was
[23:06] more revelation you know the word don't
[23:08] pass away right
[23:10] all right
[23:12] but now i can see with a little more
[23:14] light i can see
[23:15] three people
[23:16] we'll see in the end time guess what
[23:18] happened
[23:18] brother said the book is open right see
[23:22] they was only reading pages of the book
[23:24] now the book is open
[23:26] see now everything's in full view it
[23:28] didn't it didn't do away with with all
[23:31] you sitting over here you were already
[23:32] sitting here but i could only see
[23:34] brother tim but now that i see brother
[23:37] tim and brother anderson and his wife
[23:41] that don't mean his sister
[23:43] whatever her name is
[23:46] no that's
[23:47] regina yeah sister regina
[23:50] that i've only known for a few minutes
[23:52] so that's okay
[23:55] but that doesn't mean that she's not
[23:56] sitting there but see my revelation only
[23:58] shows this it's a very simple
[24:00] explanation but it explains why people
[24:02] in the message go cuckoo and say well
[24:04] brother graham said luther didn't have
[24:05] anything no no luther had what what
[24:08] luther had was what he saw right there
[24:11] didn't do away with all this but right
[24:13] here was what god was pleased with and
[24:15] what man could see during that time then
[24:18] john wesley was a little deeper
[24:20] revelation
[24:21] he could see more of the word
[24:24] didn't do away with all this
[24:26] but when the holy ghost fell on the day
[24:28] of pentecost in our age
[24:31] in our age not back then in our age you
[24:33] know in 1906 to do the street it made it
[24:35] a little bit bigger right
[24:37] then when brother brown comes he had to
[24:38] type all the loose ends well where was
[24:40] the loose ends
[24:41] the loose ends were over here
[24:43] y'all are about to
[24:44] loosen but when he tied the loose knives
[24:47] together see that brought god's whole
[24:49] vision back together again all right
[24:51] then he started preaching the seals to
[24:54] get us out of here see that didn't just
[24:56] get a revelation of back to the to paul
[24:59] and peter's day that didn't do them any
[25:01] good as far as changing their body
[25:03] that's why brother brown said the
[25:05] messenger of malachi 4 do two things two
[25:07] parts
[25:08] number one he's going to restore
[25:09] everything back to where paul peter and
[25:11] all them preached in the first three
[25:12] ages everybody understand that
[25:14] right you understand that that's what he
[25:16] come to do the first part
[25:18] the healing ministry was to catch the
[25:19] people's attention and then he started
[25:22] bringing the people back to him lord
[25:24] jesus christ one god
[25:26] what happened in the garden all of our
[25:29] basic
[25:30] uh
[25:31] beliefs and it's not our idea it's a
[25:34] total belief
[25:35] that we believe those things and then
[25:39] in 1963 he went out to arizona met the
[25:42] angels got the message and he said you
[25:44] know i was telling them this weekend
[25:46] brother branham
[25:47] was standing in that first seal second
[25:49] seal read the seal book
[25:52] he didn't pray for anybody
[25:54] right he answered their questions
[25:56] on between the six and the seventh seal
[25:58] he answered their questions he had
[25:59] questions and answered
[26:01] he seemed like he was
[26:03] he was not as excited as he was
[26:06] back in the early age
[26:08] everybody you know he's just he's
[26:10] bringing a message
[26:11] but what did he say about the second or
[26:13] third or fourth seal he said i have
[26:15] never in my life worked in this realm
[26:21] and he seemed dead ray sick healed
[26:24] bulls go lay down all these things storm
[26:27] spoken and all these things he saw all
[26:29] that he said
[26:30] i am working in a realm this week that i
[26:33] have never worked in my entire life what
[26:35] had done he had went up a level
[26:38] and he didn't say the bible became a
[26:40] brand new chapter
[26:42] right he said it became a brand new book
[26:45] the book became open to him and he saw
[26:48] why the serpent's evil was right he said
[26:50] what yeah he says what he said
[26:53] he said because the revelation uh
[26:54] revealed in the seals he said i say unto
[26:56] you go and you know stay as you are
[26:59] don't
[26:59] do this no more and imagine divorce
[27:02] problems and all the things like that
[27:04] well he didn't preach marriage and
[27:05] divorce in the seal
[27:06] did he
[27:07] he hardly made mention of it
[27:10] but because of revelation of opening of
[27:12] the seal showing the man of sin showing
[27:15] the antichrist showing jesus christ
[27:17] he had a better understanding why
[27:20] there was american divorce problems why
[27:22] there was a way out
[27:25] because to me the seals show grace
[27:27] because without those seals you and i
[27:28] are going to go by the grave we're going
[27:29] to die and just
[27:31] have to wait on the right depend on the
[27:32] resurrection
[27:34] okay
[27:35] and we do
[27:37] same spirit that raised up jesus from
[27:38] the dead if he
[27:40] lives in you he'll look in your mortal
[27:41] body one day and you'll rise up out of
[27:43] the ground but there's a group of people
[27:46] that god said
[27:47] through paul
[27:49] we
[27:51] there's one of these little words again
[27:52] remember i always tell you if it's a
[27:54] little word but it's very powerful
[27:56] if the spirit that raised up jesus from
[27:58] the dead dwell in you right right
[28:00] paul said we
[28:02] which are alive and remain
[28:04] if paul had never said that there
[28:06] wouldn't have been a there wouldn't have
[28:07] been a scripture we could fall back to
[28:09] because see even jesus died himself the
[28:11] only scripture we have is as paul said
[28:14] we which are alive and remain
[28:17] we that's a little word
[28:19] but it's going to cover a group of
[28:20] people
[28:22] we which are alive and remain see jesus
[28:24] couldn't even say that
[28:26] he said all power in heaven earth's been
[28:27] given unto me this was after he got his
[28:28] glorified body but see once he got his
[28:31] glorified body you and i were in there
[28:33] we have now the ability
[28:36] the ability we now have the ability
[28:39] to become
[28:40] just where he was standing when he said
[28:42] all power in heaven has been given unto
[28:44] men
[28:45] his body was changed he still could eat
[28:47] he could disappear
[28:49] he hung around 30 40 days just like
[28:51] we're going to after our body change
[28:53] but paul said we which are alive and
[28:56] remain
[28:57] shall not prevent or hinder
[28:59] those which are asleep
[29:01] or they go on that's all that's all
[29:04] brother tom's doing he's resting right
[29:06] he's finally got his body to rest if you
[29:09] look at many people
[29:10] and it's just to close and we'll start
[29:12] next sunday
[29:14] if you ever noticed and sister janice
[29:15] wilson was telling us a couple weeks ago
[29:17] when we were up there you know she does
[29:18] hair of the people that pass away
[29:20] the the funeral home will call him safe
[29:22] would you come up and you know fix the
[29:24] hair of the deceased
[29:27] well she said i've seen them in every
[29:28] form of you know they're very dignified
[29:30] they don't have they just land on them
[29:32] on a form
[29:34] and their hair she fixes their hair and
[29:35] stuff and does their nail
[29:37] and
[29:39] but she asked the uh
[29:41] undertaker she said do you see a
[29:43] difference
[29:45] in people dying that have died that are
[29:47] christians or so-called you know i mean
[29:50] people there at peace there's going to
[29:51] be people be given eternal life they're
[29:52] either good and preaching people
[29:54] i just believe that okay they've never
[29:56] been shown the gospel how the world are
[29:58] they gonna know the gospel that we know
[29:59] if we don't tell them brother brown said
[30:00] it's our fault because they died that
[30:02] way
[30:02] our fault
[30:04] okay
[30:05] but she said do you tell the difference
[30:08] he said oh sure
[30:10] he said yep didn't you
[30:12] said
[30:13] yes absolutely did some people come in
[30:16] with the most horrible look on their
[30:17] face
[30:19] and he said we pretty much know those
[30:20] people you know die drunk or you know
[30:22] whatever and they have a real hard look
[30:25] on their face when they pass but a
[30:27] christian's face is just so relaxed
[30:31] why
[30:32] we're going to sleep that's right right
[30:38] and let's just be honest the last time i
[30:40] saw brother tom he looked all bent over
[30:42] and of course he talked to me but you
[30:44] know he
[30:45] but he looked at peace in that casket
[30:48] why all the worry lines were gone out of
[30:50] his face
[30:52] all the worry of life was gone
[30:54] everything was relaxed
[30:56] well that man was sleeping
[30:59] waiting on you and i
[31:02] to get through this
[31:04] and do one thing and that's believe that
[31:06] it's for you
[31:08] i want us to focus on that i don't want
[31:10] this to be a sunday school class that
[31:12] i'm teaching i want you to believe
[31:15] what's being taught i want you to
[31:17] believe
[31:20] and that's the bible says by your
[31:23] words you shall be
[31:25] justified and by your words you'll be
[31:27] condemned
[31:31] that's real simple
[31:33] but that's real profound
[31:35] if
[31:36] you believe
[31:38] if
[31:40] it's for you
[31:41] if not
[31:43] you'll go by the grave which is not
[31:45] horrible
[31:47] but
[31:49] i'd like to be able to see this thing
[31:50] change
[31:51] right
[31:53] and and be changed in the morning until
[31:55] i'm going tonight and get out of here
[31:57] right
[31:58] that way our is over here
[32:00] we know we're at rest as christians but
[32:02] we still have heartaches and trials
[32:04] kids family
[32:06] work job situations that we all go
[32:09] through and that's what gives us worry
[32:10] lines on our face
[32:13] really to me that's why wrinkles come
[32:15] and you worry a lot people worry you
[32:17] know you uh y'all can tell when i have a
[32:19] headache right because my eyes start
[32:20] squinching over like this
[32:22] look see that's traits of satan
[32:24] of the fall
[32:26] of what he's doing to this human body
[32:28] and this human body is not going to
[32:30] change just because we read the field
[32:32] and because we really understand them
[32:34] you got to believe them
[32:36] you got to believe that those
[32:38] that that message from 1963 to 65 which
[32:40] is the whole message 47-63 don't kick
[32:43] out the first part
[32:44] because without 47 to 63 you have no
[32:47] foundation
[32:48] because see look i'm going to show you
[32:49] one thing turn that camera around
[32:51] before we go
[32:54] i haven't made this statement but i'm
[32:56] gonna make it now
[32:58] you can turn it around here for
[32:59] everybody to see
[33:01] if you're born again
[33:03] with the faith of the fathers this is
[33:05] not your foundation
[33:07] remember paul said leaving the principle
[33:11] leaving the principle
[33:14] this is our foundation right here that's
[33:16] right
[33:18] now i'm talking about any end time
[33:19] people that are believing that are born
[33:21] again and have the virtues working in
[33:23] their life let me be plain about that
[33:25] the people that are born again have the
[33:27] virgins working in their life this is
[33:29] our foundation right here because this
[33:31] is the countdown this is the seal this
[33:33] is the love this is what we're working
[33:34] on right now
[33:35] okay i know this is all part of it and
[33:37] this is part that we still got to deal
[33:39] with
[33:41] but leaving the principles of the
[33:42] doctrine of the cl of christ let's go on
[33:44] to perfection
[33:46] perfection is right here
[33:48] well these seals are a foundation not
[33:49] down here because they don't have this
[33:51] down here you're not under fantasy
[33:53] and let me be a little bit more plain
[33:54] without these virtues working in your
[33:56] life you're really not going to fancy it
[33:58] right but brother brown didn't preach
[33:59] him in 1947 he didn't preach him in 1959
[34:02] he preached in 1963 when he had come to
[34:05] an adoptional stage
[34:07] where god had come down and identified
[34:10] himself with that man and not just was
[34:12] pleased to dwell in him he said here's
[34:14] him
[34:15] if you're gonna get it this is where
[34:17] you're gonna get it from right here
[34:20] so if we're short which we all are and
[34:22] don't get like i said the other night
[34:24] don't get caught up with these lines
[34:27] they're just a marker there because
[34:29] because if you could write it you put
[34:30] virtue
[34:32] knowledge
[34:33] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[34:36] you put them i put them all like this
[34:38] well that's where it's going to right
[34:39] here okay
[34:40] all right we need a foundation
[34:43] but we got to get off that thing you
[34:44] know we could lay a foundation of this
[34:46] building back in 1971 when we started
[34:49] if we built this thing from scratch and
[34:51] we're standing on this right now on this
[34:52] foundation
[34:54] now if we'd never built the building
[34:55] from 1971 to 2011
[34:59] we wouldn't have church
[35:01] we'd be a bunch of dummies
[35:03] oh we got a church we got a perfect
[35:05] place to worship you only got a slap
[35:08] what did we do we started building a
[35:10] building on that foundation but now did
[35:12] we come back down here and start
[35:14] building again
[35:15] no no paul said leaving the principles
[35:17] of the doctrine of christ let's go on to
[35:18] perfection so it's up here and these
[35:20] spheres now that we're living in these
[35:22] in this time
[35:24] something happened son
[35:28] i got so weak
[35:29] creature i couldn't stand it i had to
[35:31] sit down somebody got something in the
[35:33] service thing about it
[35:35] in oklahoma i never felt that way before
[35:38] last year i couldn't get up
[35:40] i just flopped out in the seat after
[35:42] finish preaching i said god kill
[35:45] somebody save somebody and the spirit
[35:47] lord fell out of that place
[35:49] claude got to preaching he got the
[35:51] breathing
[35:52] he said he wanted to shut up but it was
[35:54] something that not happened in a long
[35:56] time
[35:57] and i think god's moving he's moving
[35:59] among us
[36:01] he's trying our faith
[36:03] because he lets you go a long time and
[36:05] you feel like you are absolutely in the
[36:06] desert eating sand and cactus
[36:25] of the house
[36:29] that's it brother
[36:32] there's two things that we got to deal
[36:34] with and i dealt with one of them last
[36:35] sunday and brother claude got a lot out
[36:38] of and he said he was going to preach
[36:39] someone but faith and love are two
[36:42] things that you and i need to really
[36:43] look at right
[36:45] faith and love they go together
[36:47] but they're separate you've got to have
[36:49] faith before you have love
[36:51] you can't have love without faith
[36:53] but you have faith without love because
[36:55] you'd be born to pyramid and not have
[36:56] that love of god now i'm not talking
[36:57] about just hugging your brother and
[36:59] sister and saying i love you no i'm
[37:00] talking about the love of god
[37:02] that'll drop down from right here to
[37:04] right here
[37:06] but if we get it right here
[37:08] if you're born again and you open
[37:10] yourself up to god and not the devil
[37:12] he'll drop it from here to here you
[37:14] can't do that right
[37:16] this is the human part lisa that you
[37:18] can't you can't you can't just grab this
[37:20] and stick it in here no god you have to
[37:22] open up that channel
[37:24] and then god's obligated
[37:27] he's not just going to think he's going
[37:28] to do it
[37:29] by faith he promised you he'd do it he
[37:32] promised you he'd go from here to here
[37:33] and it's just a straight shot
