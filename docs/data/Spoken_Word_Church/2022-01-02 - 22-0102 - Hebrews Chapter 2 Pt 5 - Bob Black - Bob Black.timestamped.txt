[0:08] this week
[0:09] and uh
[0:11] on the 26th there's a real good birthday
[0:13] coming up so
[0:17] just saying so you may be seated brother
[0:19] aaron
[0:20] where are you at brother come on are you
[0:22] who's leading singing oh oh bob i'm
[0:24] sorry would you come to san just go for
[0:26] us
[0:29] listen i've been taking up offering i
[0:31] got to go back there and run the sound
[0:32] systems okay
[0:35] forgive me
[0:39] god bless you thanks
[0:43] well we took a little detour for a few
[0:44] sundays on the away from hebrews but
[0:46] we'll get back and
[0:48] and uh kind of pick up where we left off
[0:51] if the brothers could go ahead and pull
[0:52] that slide up
[0:55] so let's just kind of recap where we
[0:57] were and then we'll continue on as we
[0:59] read through the book of hebrews
[1:02] um before we get in let's just pray real
[1:04] real quick lord god we thank you for
[1:06] your grace and mercy to us
[1:08] we just asked now as we look into the
[1:10] book of hebrews and study the lord that
[1:11] you'll just open up these things to us
[1:13] and
[1:13] and and and give us something to help us
[1:15] lord jesus
[1:17] christ lord we pray in your name
[1:21] so uh just to kind of recap a little bit
[1:24] we we kind of left off around verses 9
[1:26] and 13 as we make our way through this
[1:28] chapter and it and verse 9 says but we
[1:30] see jesus
[1:32] who was made a little lower than the
[1:33] angels for the suffering of death crown
[1:35] with glory and honor that he by the
[1:37] grace of god should taste death for
[1:39] every man for it became him for whom are
[1:41] all things and by whom are all things
[1:43] and bringing many sons unto glory to
[1:45] make the captain of their salvation
[1:47] perfect through sufferings
[1:49] for both he that sanctifieth and they
[1:52] who who are sanctified are all of one
[1:54] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:56] call them brethren
[1:57] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[1:59] brethren in the midst of the church will
[2:01] i sing praise unto thee and again i will
[2:03] put my trust in him
[2:05] and again behold i and the children
[2:08] which god hath given me
[2:10] now you notice as paul as paul is
[2:13] is preaching it each little each one of
[2:15] these verses is so packed with
[2:16] information and some of these verses
[2:18] he's quoting things from psalms he's
[2:20] quoting from isaiah and he's quoting it
[2:22] almost so fast that that uh he's really
[2:25] assuming that the people that he's
[2:27] speaking to the hebrews haven't have an
[2:29] understanding of the things that he's
[2:30] talking about
[2:32] and so
[2:33] there's so much packed into here so we
[2:35] want to just kind of unpack
[2:37] as we go along and look at some of these
[2:38] things that he's quickly referring to
[2:41] um
[2:42] so if we go to the next slide
[2:44] we see just to kind of recap i know we
[2:46] we've talked about this in some of the
[2:47] earlier little lessons but we see jesus
[2:50] and you know when you when you when as
[2:52] the word begins to open up what we're
[2:53] really looking at is we're looking at a
[2:55] revelation of jesus christ
[2:57] and brother ram said in god's provided
[2:59] place of worship he said uh but lord it
[3:01] does delight our hearts when we see
[3:03] jesus glorified among us
[3:06] so we come to church you know we see a
[3:07] lot of things in the world today we see
[3:09] a lot of things in our personal lives
[3:10] but what we really when we when you
[3:12] begin to see jesus glorified in his
[3:14] people and you see the word begin to
[3:15] open up
[3:16] you're you're you're seeing what what
[3:18] you should see in the word you know even
[3:20] brother brahma said when you you should
[3:21] see jesus in every line of the bible
[3:23] every every every scripture that you
[3:25] read in the bible shall open up jesus to
[3:27] you
[3:28] he said when we see his word
[3:30] which he is the word when we see we can
[3:32] read it here in the bible where he
[3:34] promised he would do it then see him
[3:36] work it right in us oh god how it makes
[3:38] us feel humble that we know that his
[3:40] living presence so we see you as the
[3:42] word is open up you can actually see
[3:44] christ being made manifest in your life
[3:46] and christ manifested in the body of
[3:48] believers and you're seeing god actually
[3:51] work out his his purpose purpose as the
[3:54] word comes off the page into a living
[3:56] reality
[3:58] and and and keep going on to the next
[4:00] slide he said well we see jesus who was
[4:01] made a little lower than the angels for
[4:03] the suffering of death
[4:05] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[4:06] the grace of god should taste death for
[4:09] every man
[4:10] so christ came down he came down to
[4:13] actually experience the things that we
[4:14] go through and even experience death it
[4:17] takes means to to experience
[4:19] it like psalms 34 says oh taste and see
[4:22] that the lord is good blessed is the man
[4:24] that trusted in him
[4:25] and see paul is trying to he's trying to
[4:27] express to us that we've got a high
[4:29] priest that can be touched by the
[4:30] feelings of our infirmities because he's
[4:32] he's a he's a high priest that's able to
[4:34] sucker us until later on in this in this
[4:36] chapter he says because he's he's able
[4:39] to come for us comfort us because he's
[4:41] experienced the same things that we go
[4:43] through when you're at a funeral and you
[4:45] see somebody being lowered in the casket
[4:47] in the casket down into the ground
[4:49] christ is able he's he's he was there at
[4:52] lazarus's grave he was there he's
[4:53] experienced death he's tasted all these
[4:55] things so he's able to to he's able to
[4:58] give us comfort
[5:01] and if we go on the next slide it says
[5:03] but we see jesus who was made a little
[5:05] lower than the angels for the suffering
[5:06] of death crown with the glory honor that
[5:08] he by the grace of god should taste
[5:09] death for every man and and paul he's
[5:13] you know you can you can take away from
[5:15] this that paul's trying to express
[5:17] that that because christ tasted death
[5:19] for every man he took away the sting of
[5:22] death which we read in first corinthians
[5:24] what is this thing of death this thing
[5:25] of death is sin
[5:26] he took away that sting of death because
[5:28] he he gave us the antidote for sin he
[5:31] gave us when he died on the cross and
[5:33] rose
[5:34] so that he could give us
[5:36] he could give us his life back and that
[5:38] that gives you confidence when you're
[5:40] when you come to face that hour of death
[5:42] that christ paid the price for you so
[5:44] that you can come with
[5:46] later on in this chapter paul gets into
[5:48] how the the fear of death has been
[5:50] removed and why is the fear of death
[5:52] removed the sting of death
[5:54] has been removed because because you can
[5:56] come to that hour with confidence that
[5:58] christ paid the price for you
[6:00] when you when you come to come to that
[6:02] place of death you know that that that
[6:04] sin has but the sin problem has been
[6:06] resolved that christ paid the price for
[6:09] you and you can go out down into the
[6:11] grave knowing that that you're you're
[6:13] safe you're safe in christ
[6:16] and that's why paul said in first
[6:18] corinthians chapter 15 verse 57 but
[6:21] thanks be to god which giveth us the
[6:23] victory
[6:24] through our lord jesus christ
[6:27] now in verse 10 paul goes on to say but
[6:29] for it became him for whom are all
[6:30] things and by whom are all things and
[6:32] bringing many sons into glory to make
[6:35] the captain of their salvation perfect
[6:37] through sufferings so he's the captain
[6:39] of our salvation and he was made perfect
[6:42] through suffering there the in the in
[6:43] the garden of gethsemane they're crying
[6:45] out the
[6:46] father let this cup pass for me as he
[6:48] went through all that suffering
[6:50] but he was made the captain of our he's
[6:52] the captain of our salvation and brother
[6:54] brown said the brains of the army lays
[6:56] in his captains the intelligence
[6:58] you know a lot of times we'll think
[7:00] we've we got everything figured out but
[7:02] if we'll just if we'll just follow the
[7:03] captain through the battle as you know
[7:05] you're you've got might have relatives
[7:07] in the hospital or or relatives that are
[7:09] loved ones that are that are lost and
[7:12] and uh
[7:14] not not at the place where they're
[7:15] supposed to be not coming to church but
[7:17] just put everything follow that captain
[7:19] follow follow him and he'll lead you
[7:20] through all the battle and all the
[7:22] sufferings and all the hardships he'll
[7:24] lead you if you follow your captain that
[7:26] brother ham said if he's the right kind
[7:27] of a general if he's the right kind if
[7:29] he's a four-star general if he's proved
[7:31] if he's been proven to be right
[7:33] follow him though it may seem wrong to
[7:36] you
[7:37] go on to the front do as he told you so
[7:40] if we'll just stay in line with god's
[7:41] word everything will work out all right
[7:43] through all the battles and all the
[7:44] sufferings and all the heartaches and
[7:46] and a battle
[7:48] a battle is rough a battle is and that's
[7:50] why brother brown he kept reiterating he
[7:52] wants us to be not little not like not
[7:55] uh you know hot house plants but he
[7:57] wants us to be real soldiers of the
[7:59] cross to stand behind our captain and
[8:01] forge forge ahead into the fight
[8:05] and i'm just trying to recap a little
[8:07] bit before we kind of get into into some
[8:08] of the new new verses that we haven't
[8:10] covered before
[8:12] in verse 11 he says for both he that
[8:14] sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
[8:16] are all of one
[8:18] that now that's that's you know he's
[8:20] painting a picture that that the one
[8:22] that's doing the sanctifying the one
[8:24] that came to sanctify us his purpose is
[8:26] to make us all one and and brother brown
[8:29] said don't you see the vine and the
[8:30] branch there in other words that that
[8:32] life that's in the vine it's coming out
[8:34] through the branches the same life that
[8:37] was in him is the same life that is in
[8:39] you the believer because you've been
[8:41] sanctified and cleansed by his word
[8:44] now that's what in john chapter 15 it
[8:46] says i am the true vine and my father is
[8:48] the husbandman
[8:50] every branch in me that beareth not
[8:51] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[8:53] that beareth fruit he purges it that
[8:55] then it may bring forth more fruit
[8:57] now you are clean through the word which
[8:59] i have spoken unto you so the thing
[9:01] that's sanctifying us is his word that
[9:03] he's given to us as you receive the word
[9:05] the word is actually claiming your life
[9:07] is taking a hold of your life it's like
[9:09] a
[9:10] you know when the astronauts landed on
[9:12] the moon they put that flag down and
[9:13] they said we've been here and as as you
[9:16] receive the word uh as you receive the
[9:18] word it's like god's taking a claim on
[9:20] your life any and and you go down to the
[9:22] water be baptized and you've done what
[9:24] god said he's taken a claim on your life
[9:27] and you believe and you believe and
[9:28] along as you go along he's he's his word
[9:31] is actually
[9:33] it's claiming you and and and cleansing
[9:35] you from the things of this world
[9:37] now you're clinging to the words which i
[9:39] have spoken unto you you think about you
[9:41] think about the grace that god has given
[9:42] to us that as you receive the word is
[9:44] it's actually changing you so that the
[9:47] as you receive the word precept upon
[9:49] precept to line up online it's adding
[9:51] word upon word and it's changing you
[9:53] from the way that you used to be to
[9:54] until god is molding you into
[9:57] into oneness with him
[9:59] he said abide in me and i and you as the
[10:01] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[10:03] except it abide in the vine no more can
[10:05] ye except ye abide in me
[10:07] i am the vine ye are the branches he
[10:09] that abideth in me and i in him the same
[10:11] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[10:14] ye can do nothing
[10:15] now see that's what paul is really
[10:17] talking about here when he says for both
[10:18] he that sanctifieth and they who are
[10:20] sanctified are all of one they've got
[10:22] that same life in them the same life
[10:25] that's in christ is the same life that's
[10:26] in the church the same life that's in
[10:28] the bride
[10:29] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[10:32] call them brethren right there
[10:35] now
[10:38] let's go to
[10:39] let's go to the next slide
[10:42] paul talking about he's not ashamed to
[10:43] call us brother
[10:45] that he would come down and be
[10:46] associated come down and not humble
[10:48] himself in a little manger so that he
[10:49] could call himself our brothers
[10:52] call himself that to be one of us to be
[10:54] veiled in flesh and robed in flesh so
[10:56] that he could put his own
[10:58] life in us and be called our brother it
[11:00] says he said paul said i will declare
[11:03] thy name unto my brethren
[11:05] in the midst of the church while i sing
[11:07] praise unto thee
[11:09] now brother ram said he's not ashamed
[11:12] to be called our brother
[11:15] for he was tempted just like we are
[11:17] tempted he's going through the same
[11:18] things
[11:19] the same struggles
[11:21] he was tempted just like we are tempted
[11:24] and he said he can be the right kind of
[11:26] an intercessor
[11:27] because he stood the same kind of a
[11:29] temptation that you stand
[11:31] now you think about that that's a
[11:32] comfort to
[11:33] little children
[11:35] he was a child once
[11:36] adults he's gone through the the same
[11:39] all of the same the same journey and he
[11:42] said he took your place
[11:44] knowing that you couldn't take it
[11:46] yourself
[11:47] and he's the right kind of a chief chief
[11:49] captain of our salvation because he
[11:52] suffered just like we suffered
[11:55] that should give us confidence when we
[11:57] go to the lord in prayer and begin to
[11:58] ask god help i'm i i'm in a straight i'm
[12:01] in a place
[12:03] and knowing that that he was there at
[12:05] the grace of grave of lazarus he wept
[12:07] when lazarus passed away he he was there
[12:10] he he's he's gone through trials just
[12:11] like we have
[12:13] he's been tempted just like we're
[12:15] tempted and he's not ashamed to be
[12:16] called our brother because he knows what
[12:20] we go through with oh blessed be his
[12:22] name now now we think about that as we
[12:25] as we keep going through this chapter
[12:27] chapter
[12:28] saying i will declare thy name unto my
[12:31] brethren
[12:32] that he's not he
[12:34] he's not ashamed
[12:36] to call us his brothers
[12:39] if we go to the next verse and again i
[12:41] will put my trust in him now now he's
[12:44] quoting he's quoting from the book of
[12:45] isaiah
[12:47] again i will put my trust in him and
[12:49] again behold i and the children which
[12:52] god hath given me
[12:54] now see this is where paul gets into he
[12:56] starts quoting from isaiah and and the
[12:58] people that he's speaking to the hebrews
[13:00] they they are familiar because hebrews
[13:03] studied the old testament scripture
[13:04] they're familiar with these with all
[13:06] these stories and all these little maybe
[13:08] obscure little sayings so paul's saying
[13:10] it real fast but he knows that they
[13:12] they're familiar with the stories but
[13:13] maybe maybe us gentile barbarians are
[13:15] not so familiar with these little
[13:18] these little old
[13:19] these little stories that he's quickly
[13:21] referring to
[13:22] he's the story that he's referring to
[13:24] and my has a story is the story in
[13:27] isaiah chapter 8
[13:29] where where isaiah is saying and what it
[13:32] actually starts in chapter seven and
[13:33] we'll read it here for a little bit he
[13:35] said bind up the testimony
[13:37] seal the law among my disciples
[13:39] and i will wait upon the lord
[13:42] that hide of his face from the house of
[13:44] jacob
[13:45] and i will look for him
[13:46] now paul kind of he kind of rewards it a
[13:48] little bit i'll put my trust in him
[13:51] and then isaiah says behold i and the
[13:53] children whom the lord have given me are
[13:54] for signs and for wonders in israel from
[13:57] the lord of hosts which dwelleth in
[13:59] mount zion
[14:00] and paul says he just shortens it he
[14:02] says behold i am the children which god
[14:04] has given me
[14:05] now now to kind of set the the the stage
[14:09] of what paul what isaiah is doing isaiah
[14:11] had these two children that they had
[14:13] they had a name
[14:15] that he gave him if we go to the next
[14:16] slide
[14:18] share joshua
[14:20] meant a remnant will return and maher
[14:21] shalom is meant quick to plunder and
[14:23] swift to spoil god told him to name
[14:26] these two children a name that that
[14:28] everywhere they went they these these
[14:30] two children that he had had a message
[14:32] that they were going to take
[14:34] so you know they'd go to the playground
[14:35] at school or maybe maybe when they got
[14:37] older they went to work and everybody
[14:39] would say hey my heart shallow hosh boss
[14:41] that's that's a fun name to say
[14:44] hey my herschel hushposh
[14:47] you know and then come over here let's
[14:48] let's uh let me talk to you or whatever
[14:50] and every time that they would talk to
[14:51] them or call their name
[14:53] they were they were a message was being
[14:56] delivered to the here you you think
[14:58] about that the same way with when you go
[15:00] to work or the children go to the
[15:02] playground or whatever your life is
[15:04] actually delivering a message and and
[15:07] see that see
[15:08] the message that isaiah had he was
[15:10] saying i and the children and the lord
[15:12] have given me offer signs and for
[15:14] wonders in other words
[15:16] isaiah's message
[15:18] and the children that god had given him
[15:20] with those special names were for signs
[15:22] and wonders to the children of israel so
[15:25] isaiah coupled with those children
[15:27] were a message so
[15:29] you think about now christ came down
[15:31] from glory and he is so she wanted to be
[15:33] called our brethren
[15:35] and so he he had a message and he came
[15:38] down to to share with us his message
[15:41] when you catch that message you've got a
[15:43] message too you've got a message just
[15:44] like isaiah's
[15:46] sons had a message but uh shared jashub
[15:49] and my heart shallow hospitals
[15:50] everywhere they went they were
[15:51] delivering a message and what was their
[15:53] message their message was that if you
[15:56] have confidence the message
[15:58] what kind i'm kind of summarizing before
[15:59] we kind of read some scriptures
[16:02] the message that isaiah was trying to
[16:03] deliver to king ahaz was
[16:05] if you believe in the lord
[16:07] god god is going to deliver you now
[16:10] you know look at the name shall i hear
[16:12] joshua that means that you know war war
[16:14] is going to be inevitable destruction is
[16:16] going to follow there's going to be a
[16:17] lot of hard times but god's going to
[16:19] bring out a little remnant there's still
[16:20] going to be a little remnant that's
[16:21] still going to believe you
[16:23] and my hershey little hotspot is quick
[16:25] to plunder swift to pull spoil he said
[16:27] now watch now god's going to use your in
[16:29] the assyrian army he's going to use the
[16:31] assyrian army to to destroy all your
[16:34] enemies and and there's going to be a
[16:35] lot of spoil and everything but the
[16:37] whole message that these two boys had
[16:39] was that
[16:41] watch watch and see what god is able to
[16:43] do
[16:44] now see uh
[16:46] he so isaiah had these two sons
[16:49] he had these two sons that had a message
[16:51] and uh
[16:53] i'm i'm trying to summarize to save a
[16:55] little time
[16:58] when isaiah in chapter eight when he
[17:00] went to talk to ahaz ahaz was he was a
[17:02] uh
[17:03] he was a little bit scared he was a
[17:05] little bit worried that you know things
[17:07] were not going to work out all right
[17:08] because he was looking at circumstance
[17:10] he was looking at the politics of the
[17:11] day and the great big assyrian army and
[17:14] so isaiah isaiah went to
[17:17] king ahaz and he began to talk to him
[17:19] about uh what the lord had told him and
[17:21] and and in isaiah chapter seven he
[17:23] actually go
[17:24] god told him to take take shaheer share
[17:27] joshua his little boy i don't know how
[17:29] old he was take him with him because
[17:32] that little boy with that name
[17:34] that god's gonna bring a remnant out
[17:36] that little boy was delivering a message
[17:37] so isaiah goes and he's got his he's got
[17:39] his son with him to deliver a message
[17:42] and now now picture this just just to
[17:44] set the context two boys
[17:47] with the message
[17:48] and right there in the middle i i king
[17:51] ahazle begins to kind of doubt whether
[17:53] or not the message of isaiah is correct
[17:55] whether he's telling him something and
[17:57] then isaiah he stops right in the middle
[17:59] and he's so he's got two sons but then
[18:01] he tells him about another son
[18:04] he says i he said therefore the lord he
[18:06] said you want a sign
[18:08] i'll give you a sign
[18:09] therefore the lord himself shall give
[18:11] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[18:14] conceive
[18:15] and bear a son and shall call his name
[18:17] emmanuel
[18:18] and what does the manual mean emmanuel
[18:20] means god with us what's see see how
[18:22] this ties in with what paul's talking
[18:24] about paul's talking about behold i and
[18:26] the children which god has given me he's
[18:28] going back to the prophecy that isaiah
[18:30] gave that god is going to come down and
[18:33] be our brethren that he's not ashamed to
[18:36] be our brother and he's not ashamed to
[18:38] be veiled in flesh and he's going back
[18:41] to the prophecy that isaiah had of a
[18:43] that a virgin shall conceive and in this
[18:45] story that he's telling of these these
[18:48] two sons that isaiah had
[18:50] and and and and the son that was
[18:53] prophesied a virgin shall conceive and
[18:55] bear a son and shall call his name
[18:57] emmanuel
[18:59] now if we go
[19:00] which slide are we on
[19:02] yeah let's go to the
[19:05] to the next slide
[19:07] so isaiah if you go back and read isaiah
[19:09] chapter seven
[19:11] and and he talks about a virgin shall
[19:13] conceive chapter eight where he
[19:16] prophesized like a uh before mahershala
[19:19] hospitals was even born god told him
[19:21] that how to name him and and and and
[19:23] wrote it in a scroll
[19:25] and and and then in verse in chapter 9
[19:27] he said for unto us a child is born unto
[19:30] us a son is given talking about a child
[19:33] coming
[19:34] tie that back with hebrews now behold i
[19:37] am the children which god hath given me
[19:39] but he's talking about a child that's
[19:41] going to come that would not be ashamed
[19:42] to be our brother and to abide with us
[19:44] and go through all of the things that we
[19:45] go through
[19:47] and the government shall be upon his
[19:49] shoulder and his name shall be called
[19:51] wonderful counsel of the mighty god the
[19:52] everlasting father the prince of peace
[19:55] now if we go to the next slide let's
[19:58] read this coupled with some other
[19:59] verses in the bible
[20:01] paul said in verse 12 saying i will
[20:03] declare thy name unto my brethren and
[20:06] that's what jesus said in john chapter 7
[20:08] 18 i have manifested thy name unto the
[20:11] men which thou gavest me out of the
[20:13] world
[20:14] thine they were and thou gave us me and
[20:17] they have kept thy word and and that's
[20:21] jesus came and he had now we are his
[20:23] children because he manifested his name
[20:26] unto the brethren and now now he's
[20:28] that child that isaiah was talking about
[20:31] now that child has children and we are
[20:33] his children we're begotten of him by
[20:35] his word
[20:36] he said thine they were and thou gave us
[20:38] to me and they have kept thy word in
[20:40] galatians chapter 3 says for ye are all
[20:43] the children of god
[20:44] by faith in christ jesus now to see to
[20:47] how that perfectly that ties in with
[20:49] isaiah 8 18 behold i and the children
[20:52] whom the lord hath given me are for
[20:54] signs and for wonders in israel from the
[20:56] lord of hosts that means that makes that
[20:58] makes you you tie that in
[21:00] now you are a sign and a wonder because
[21:02] you actually vindicate everything the
[21:04] bible says about you actually vindicate
[21:07] you're a sign that the message is
[21:09] correct because the life that you're
[21:11] living proves out that the words that
[21:13] we've heard the our our brother our
[21:15] prophet preach are correct you're
[21:17] actually the the vindication that is
[21:19] true
[21:20] because when you when you live your life
[21:22] when you go to work when you go to
[21:24] school you actually have a message just
[21:26] like those children of isaiah that that
[21:29] testify that if you'll trust in the lord
[21:31] god will god will win the battle
[21:38] let's keep let's keep going on to the
[21:39] next slide
[21:40] paul said for as much then as the
[21:42] children are partakers of flesh and
[21:44] blood he also himself likewise took part
[21:46] of the same
[21:48] that through death he might destroy him
[21:50] that had the power of death that is the
[21:52] devil
[21:53] and deliver them who through fear of
[21:55] death were all their lifetimes subject
[21:57] to bondage
[21:58] and brother brown said on that day on
[22:00] calvary he said that's what calvary
[22:02] meant
[22:03] men that were in bondage were set free
[22:06] men that were once under fear of death
[22:08] can no longer fear death
[22:10] a man who longs for a city whose builder
[22:12] and maker is god he can step on the
[22:14] highway and set his face towards heaven
[22:16] because he's free
[22:18] he's redeemed he don't need to wonder no
[22:20] more for there's a way of knowing
[22:22] whether you are right or not
[22:24] god gives us life our sins are gone
[22:28] that day at calvary paid the price
[22:31] and that's that's why christ came to
[22:33] take to take away the fear to die for us
[22:35] to take away the fear of death for then
[22:37] you watch how i'm gonna read some quotes
[22:39] here where brother brownlee goes along
[22:41] the fear of death the fear of death
[22:44] firstly the fear of death when you're
[22:46] born again and you realize that that the
[22:49] christ has paid the price for your sins
[22:51] and you've accepted it and you've
[22:52] received that vindication in your soul
[22:54] and you know that if you come to death
[22:56] that there's there's that the problem
[22:58] has been resolved then you know
[23:01] that the fear of death is gone but but
[23:03] yet there's there's still a little bit
[23:05] something
[23:06] brother brown he always talked about
[23:08] early on in his ministry you're like i
[23:10] i'm you know
[23:11] it's an unknown there's always a fear of
[23:13] the unknown
[23:14] like if you if if you were to die
[23:17] without understanding what whether or
[23:19] not you're you're going to be a solid
[23:21] entity whether or not you can shake your
[23:22] brother's hands over there what whether
[23:24] or not what whether or not your their
[23:26] soul sleeping is true whether you're
[23:27] going to just going to be like it like
[23:29] this and
[23:30] like gone until until the resurrection
[23:33] and then you come back into a body
[23:35] all those things there's still like a
[23:37] little fear there see what the message
[23:39] has done for us it took away all the
[23:41] fear it took away all the fear because
[23:43] we know where we're going right
[23:46] and then brother brown said now on the
[23:47] next slide he said of course we do he
[23:49] said there's no need of fear and death
[23:51] of course we do when none of us want to
[23:53] die we we what we call died he said but
[23:56] now of course going down to the
[23:58] highlighted part we being human walking
[24:00] these dark elements here we do not
[24:02] understand it as we should
[24:04] he said but if we can just look beyond
[24:06] the curtain yonder there is where it's
[24:08] at
[24:09] and now this is what paul is talking
[24:11] about that he took away the fear that he
[24:13] took away the sting of death but now i i
[24:16] want to take it a little bit further and
[24:18] the message that brother branham gave us
[24:20] to take it took away completely the fear
[24:22] of dying and and i'm running out of time
[24:25] here so brother ryan said he he got to
[24:27] when he's when he went beyond the
[24:28] curtain of time he said i do not fear
[24:31] death he said before he was like
[24:34] you know there's still a little bit of
[24:36] fear of the unknown
[24:37] but when he went beyond the curtain of
[24:39] time he said i do not fear i have not
[24:41] one fear of death death has no fear at
[24:44] all
[24:45] and it doesn't for you if you just
[24:47] understood
[24:49] you know when you see a loved one not
[24:50] we've got i've we've heard so many
[24:52] testimonies of people dying and then uh
[24:55] seeing somebody across the curtain of
[24:57] time just as they're dead as they're
[24:59] dying and you know when you hear about
[25:01] people that you used to know on the
[25:02] other side that gives you confidence
[25:05] that there's a land beyond the river
[25:07] that gives you confidence as there's a
[25:08] place that you're going to we were
[25:10] talking about um
[25:12] i i'm drawing a blank at the brother's
[25:14] name but he used to be an evangelist and
[25:15] then he passed away years ago and a
[25:17] little sister that we know passed away
[25:19] and she he always had a great sense of
[25:21] humor and she when she was passing away
[25:23] she she she saw him on the other side
[25:26] and she came back and she said you know
[25:27] that brother still has the same sense of
[25:29] humor that he did here
[25:31] and another story we were talking about
[25:33] this this little sister that uh
[25:36] uh she uh she passed away and a lot of
[25:39] people said well you know she was always
[25:40] kind of a little bit crabby with her
[25:42] husband and everything and she she you
[25:44] know something and some people were kind
[25:45] of wondering if if she went to heaven or
[25:47] not but but th this this uh this little
[25:50] sister she was on her deathbed and she
[25:52] looked and she said there's their sister
[25:55] so-and-so she's coming to meet me at the
[25:56] river you see how sometimes we fail to
[25:59] give grace when when
[26:01] but what confidence that gives to know
[26:03] that the ones that have gone on before
[26:05] what are they waiting for us on the
[26:07] other on the other side the musicians
[26:08] should go ahead and come forward
[26:10] that takes away the fear of death
[26:13] and we'll we'll in there
[26:17] [Applause]
