========================================

Lord bless each and every one of you thank you for thanks to brother Bob for pitching in and helping did a wonderful job I listened to some of it this week while we were traveling but uh let's get back to uh get back to our study get our mind back on him and and what we're doing brother I don't mean to interrupt again I apologize for not being here last Sunday we left that Motel up there I I've slept for two days after I come back I was so exhausted so I apologize for not being here okay happen again apologize to him yeah did that too yeah I knew you did first all right let's turn to Revelation 6 now what we're in we're in the third seal all right all right the third he's upstairs because they're making a tap for him and he said they making he gets a tape he has to be upstairs he don't get to be here and get a tape so he kind of got playing yeah yeah yeah okay he we having a concert to be here bet oh okay I guess I better turn this thing off o why didn't you tell me you're my sound man Tim bro listen y'all need to pray for Tim he has to put up with me five or six days a week but I think if he could have got by with it the other day when I come back to work he would G me a big old kiss he sent me a he sent me a u um text message that how much he missed me so bless is real real man he's a good kid I like like to work with him I like to see his life change more than anything see a life change right buddy I'm sure Rachel scolded him some while you were yeah probably all right third seal now we got we're hooked up and we're on when he had opened the third seal I heard the third B say come and see and I beheld in l a black horse he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine now let's go back and get our symbols together our symbols on the third seal is what pair balances wheat and barley oil and wine it was a black horse which we we looked in the denomination on ISM and death now remember let's don't get this confused let's stay at the level because the second seal was red that was killing that was physically killing the people right we've moved up a little higher now cuz this is spiritual death remember the Blackness of Cain he killed Abel but he he didn't kill Abel to make him bad came became one with his Doctrine before and that's what caused him to kill Abel right all right that's what caused him to kill Abel so what was his Doctrine is what killed him and then he got able killed physically all right so we come through the White Horse which he had to start with the White Horse couldn't start with the red had to start with the white cuz everything had to be righteous right good upstanding people right little saying little deed little little foxes that's full ofine all right so then Satan moved up in the second seal to a what a red horse where he physically killed the people and and uh June's going to look up uh and I you know you can read Fox's book of Martyrs if you want to I started reading it but it was it's kind of rough to read but Google Dark Ages that second seal covered the Dark Ages in Columbus time all right and um there's some good commentary on what happened during the Dark Ages all right we know that the Catholic Church physically killed 60 8 million Protestants because of their Doctrine killed them physically right all right but see Satan wasn't finished there you know what Satan did Satan did God a favor in the people too he put the Christians in the sixth Dimension where they're Eternal so Satan's like well I got to do something else that's what the devil thinks cuz he sure does play with my mind enough to make me think that way right yeah we're all those that are immune come come in and teach this Ser teach all right but uh we are looking now at something that Satan done he's not physically killing the people now he's killing them spiritually that's right black denominational death brother randam said in in the I was reading the third seal he said he said and he would get on over even into the seventh seal and he said now I know why I was so against those denominations not the people right but now let me add something to that you say well the people are good people they are but if they take on that Doctrine they're just as dead as that denomination is sorry that's right I didn't say that God said it God said it's my way or no other way that's right sorry that's what he said so they may be good people and they may be given eternal life but they got to go to the white Throne judgment and be judged for what they do and what they know right all right but now you and I don't have that excuse all right we're we're either do or die here all right when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld a little black horse and he that s on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beast that's what I want to get to Heard a Voice this is the first time you hear another voice other than the four Beast remember and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine seal those people up with the Holy Ghost cuz see we went through justification right we went through sanctification in the red horse right the blood and now we've come to it you say well what is black got to do with having the Holy Ghost if you're not dead today if the old you is not dead you don't have the Holy Ghost and what's death black brother you got to be zeroed out blacked out whatever you want to say you I see the physical you sitting here you're not physically dying I mean yeah we're physically dying but we're not physically Dead all right but inside it's where the dying is the worst brother BR said 68 million cathol I mean 68 million Protestants were killed during the Reformation or not the Reformation but the um uh Dark Ages he said Untold billions by their Doctrine so see we've come to where we've talked about and this is the point I want you to see we've talked about what justification talked about sanctification now we're talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a type because the wicked one brings you denominational ideas even the church age was the fifth and sixth age which is Luther and Wesley and that combat Beast was man but this right here was so important this third seal was so important that the prophet said the lamb spoke himself read your seal book y'all need to read the third seal over and over again it was the lamb that spoke CU it said in the midst of the four Beast what the lamb is protecting the lamb comes on the scene at the Holy Ghost and only at the Holy Ghost does he come on the scene right MH all right we know he's on the scene of justification in a partial form sanctification in a partial form but it's the lamb himself it was the Lamb of God he gave his life for who me and you so when we're born again we receive that lamb that sacrifice he we have to look to him correct right we can't sacrifice ourselves I'm going to read you something in the seal book it's going to help you let's don't let read it in just a minute but there's where that we see the third seal he was so protective of those people he said see thou not hurt the oil and the wine now what's brother brand said wine was stimulation and oil was the Holy Ghost oil types the Holy Ghost wine types of stimulation of Revelation that you get when you have the Holy Ghost wheat and barley or what sustaining life bread all right and then the pair of balances was the one Satan had in his hand right he had a pair of balance bances and he said he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand so Satan's the only thing that have this in his hand he didn't have this Satan can't touch that wheat and barley he can't touch the true word of God he can't touch the oil and the wine or we can imitate it cuz we saw him imitate in the first stage right but he's come to a higher form now to where man he's got a pair of balances in his hand because look that's what it says here when he had open third seal go down to the Black Horse and he that sat on him him had a pair of balances in his hand period And I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine all right so that was what the lamb said the lamb spoke and said hey in other words listen to this the person on that horse has no power the person on that horse has no way to sustain your life he can't give you bread he can't give you all in one Jesus is saying in the in the lamb form the Lord is saying protect see thou not hurt this group of people cuz he knew that see Satan had become more and more shrew because look the combat Beast with a man what is that intelligence so Satan came from physically killing somebody where I can look and see that that sister Gwen's being persecuted and the Catholic Church kills her and she's out of the way her Soul's locked away but see we can see that physically but to sit somewhere and and die spiritually remember the Bible says a woman is dead while she's living talking about the church talking about the church but still talking about you and I individuals cuz the Baptist Methodist Pentecostal they're dead they're dead while they're living we see them Al and go church and they build big churches and all that but they're dead full of Dead Man's Bones the Bible said all right but here the lamb has come on the scene in this third seal why that's the Holy Ghost Christ the lamb the Holy Ghost brother Brown said was the what same person so there was the lamb speaking out a measure of a measure of barley a measure of wheat for a penny but don't you hurt the oil in wine all right so at third seal he brings in he brings in an idea that I want you to think about God comes on the scene at the new birth right that's God himself coming to take up a boat in you but if you're still alive spiritually the old person the one that your mom and daddy gave you the old natur if it's still alive all you done was divorce the thing and you can't marry sisters you can't marry until your husband is what dead dead brothers and sisters we can't marry Christ until our husband is dead they can't they can't hear you death so the old you is dead God don't reside you can't put him in a closet and pull him out when you need him that's right cuz the old man is definitely he's going to come out of that closet by himself you're not going to have to go get it that's right right right I was wondering whether the wheat and barley had anything to do with at the end time here now the same uh you won't be able to buy or sell unless you take that Mark right well it says this does say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny the only thing brother brandham said was that was the sustaining life that Satan see Satan now is trying to take that life away from us right we know Jesus is a bread of life and we're we're not you know we're not denying that but you and I if he transfers all that he was to us then what are we we're the bread of life right somebody cannot get the Holy Ghost you look at me kind of awkward I thought we were Christ made manifest in another form where does life come from the body of Christ like from the body right which is the wheat and the bread The Barley right if Jesus said I am the bread and he comes inside of me and I speak his word and you get a revelation you didn't get it from me you got it from God but like daddy's been preaching you listen to what he's saying the words of a man not nothing to do with us as far as flesh we're just servants we just stand here suppos to be empty but God's going to speak to you through somebody that's right I don't care if it's another sister or a brother but see God's not going to give you the Holy Ghost by him just speaking it directly to you that's not the way it happens right right that's right you had to hear the what word and did you hear it from somebody either Grandma Grandpa Mama daddy brother sister you heard the word whether you wanted to hear it or not physically you heard the word right brother Tim you heard it from somebody that's right you know all that times Mama used to tell me you know this and that and the other that was God speaking to me but I what I do I didn't listen so see I can reverse this thing and see that this black horse done something he cut me off from God see he killed a lot of people with Doctrine more than he killed him with physical sword or tear him apart or beheading or all that he done those people a favor see we got to look at this thing like Brother Don you know I went in there last night and and sister Jun and I went in and had a chance to just kind of stand there and talk to him for a few minutes and of course he they said he could he could hear and uh and I said Brother Don I said I'll see you in the morning true he just going to be as sleep one night that's right and I was telling June have you ever read your jensson book you see where brother rown died he died at 549 Christmas Eve morning 557 557 sorry well I looked up this morning it's really actually 549 see he's only going to be dead for a few minutes cuz he's the one that told us sometime between 6 and 99 in the morning mhm the dead in Christ is going to rise right so he didn't make it at 6:00 but he's only got just a few minutes left right think of it that way Brother Don was 83 years old God did him a favor by taking him home sometimes we wish as humans to hold on to them but when they get to that age that's uh you know we went and spoke with him a few weeks ago and and he said brother I just can't have faith for myself I said well we're just going to believe for you but his s his his daughter prayed that he he would go if he was going to go go quick yeah and Buddy he went quick yeah but I leaned down I told him I said Brother Don I said I see you in the morning I always tell people that told told Brother you know brother Tom that long time before he died that just don't worry about it don't worry sure this Blackness of death is something that scares all of us but when Jesus he must be protecting somebody when he speaks himself out of this third seal says hey yes hurt not the allil the wine I'm the bread they're going to get it from me but you're not going to hurt somebody that's got the Holy Ghost in Revelation right you can't hurt a Christian I told Brother Don I said you know just something they said that you know he could hear and he's laying there and I told the told Brother Don I said I want you to tell me that job about O Jones when I see you again and his old finger didn't his old finger just went to twe twitching I mean his finger just went to twitching like crazy he heard what I said cuz I can't remember the joke but he told it in brother brandham the story behind that Brother Don was standing at the Tabernacle telling a joke and brother Brandon was driving by with his window down and he heard him telling a joke and he said oh that's a that joke about O Jones so he knew the same joke that brother Bram knew so that's kind of the way I put that together but I wanted to relate something to him so he could remember he won't forget that right he's in he's in a dimension now where he won't forget that right and I told him I said I want you to tell me that joke when you see me and boy old finger just went to twitching like crazy you know he's just doing this fun just like this that's but he couldn't speak and he couldn't you know his human faculties we going away but as the human faculty goes away that's when that protection comes cuz a lamb is our protector right amen he's the one who protects us cuz he gives us what he gives us our bread give us our oil and our wine you know it to take away the the Earthly part of it but if you had wine and bread you understand about wine I mean if you drank a lot of wine you'd be drunk but people in the other countries that's they drink wine for their meals and they don't think a thing about it but oil wine wheat and Barley if you had unlimited amount of Wheat and barley and oil you'd never go hungry and you'd have wine to drink that's what was telling it right here in this seal when he saw that horse rider go out he said hey don't worry when somebody says this thing is black that's just my Revelation that God's tell trying to tell us hey I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you thank you Lord I'm going to be with you right here even till death physical death comes that's okay I'll be right there with you the whole time all right I've always said many times that that you know we believe in angels brother Bown said the death angel come to get you but that death Angel's got one thing he's got a problem with a Christian I think about this the other day we were sitting somewhere in airport I guess and uh just masses of people and you know remember I told you one time that I you asked the Lord said why why me why me and all these 50,000 people that go through Atlanta airport why I mean he said because you chose me above and they never would come to a realization that I was their savior then I was sitting there I was like Lord what in the world but all the Death Angels do they just take these people and they put them in what The Fifth Dimension right they put him in the dimension of the Dead well we don't go in The Fifth Dimension we ain't dead that's a good old southern word we ain't dead we are not dead we are alive right so that when that Death Angel comes to get a Christian I don't believe he can even touch him I believe he just brother Ram said he'll send somebody down to the river right thank God for a prophet he said he said the Lord will send somebody down to the river that you know they send you down to the river them down to the river to help you across Jordan so whoever Brother Don knew could be brother Brandon but you know what the dead in Christ arise first and I was thinking this morning it says the first shall be last I mean the and the last shall be first we're the last Church age but we're going to be the first church a to resurrect so we're going to get to see him amen cuz he's under the protection you say oh no if you got the Holy Ghost you're protected right that's why we type justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost justification first seal sanctification second seal and the third seal is is not So Much Death as as as oh this death is going to grip you no I want to die I want to die I ain't dead enough I want to be dead but at least one thing I know the the one inside of me that you can't see he died a long time ago you may have problems in that Spirit realm and in that flesh realm but that man died and I'm sealed in by what the Holy Spirit but see that's just the earnest cuz the seals don't stop at number three that's just the earnest I don't like saying just the holy spirit's not a just but the Bible did call it a thing all right black horse that doesn't start your journey I mean stop your journey that begins your journey as a Christian right the spirit part of you starts cuz the oh you does what do we do in baptism we bury them but we don't leave them under thank God we resurrect them to what newness of life life you say all this yeah there's life and death because death is going to be swallowed up the Bible says in what life death is going to be swallowed up in life and that's what he's telling us in this third seal he said hey don't worry he said it himself he spoke brother R said the lamb speaks out of the midst of the four beast and says don't you hurt this thing don't you hurt these people sure they going to physically kill them but when that Death Angel went in to get brother dawn last night 1:00 or this morning at 1:00 that angel had to take him to a different place and it wasn't the angel it wasn't the angel that had a choice he had to take him in the sixth Dimension that's why death is not a ruler over us if you're a Christian even in physical death that Death Angel comes to get you you say no I know where I'm going right just get me down to the river there'll be somebody will have their hand out yes Lord somebody will be there to help me across that river that dark place we call death but justification sanctification we've come to the man which is intelligent so what God what God did is God said protect them give them the Holy Ghost protect them and a type of us now not that age didn't get all the Holy Ghost don't don't don't get mixed up right everybody understand that we're typing kind of back and forth but the the physical death is that that black horse is going to ride he's riding through denominational ideas it's the man age or intelligence age so what did Satan do Satan said well I can't if I physically kill them I'm doing them a favor so now I'm going to let them live but I'm going to give them a different Doctrine which is much more deceptive and much more black as far as death than the other one which was the the sanctification or the physical killing of the people people the red but in this fifth and sixth age is when denominational ideas began to come now Luther Luther wasn't a denomination Luther was a born again Christian Luther was bride and the people he pulled out of that Catholic church or wherever from was bride right he was a Protestant he protested the Catholic Church those people came out and God was pleased to dwell in that man Luther but now when Luther died what did it become a Lutheran Doctrine Satan said oh Mighty Man remember Satan's follows Satan never goes ahead of God remember one thing for sure if Satan's doing something God's already done it in the positive form remember that Satan's already done it in the I mean God's always already done it in the positive form Satan's doing it in the negative form so as as he told him hurt not the only one this black horse is not going to hurt US unless we let it hurt yes Lord but if we're sealed in by the Holy Spirit then we are dead but you know what what comes to us at the New Birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost what God himself intelligence we take all that that was in here what happened to the the day of Pentecost the 120 in the upper room listen to The Very Word of Life The Very bread they listened to Jesus for three and A2 years did not have a clue what he was saying but they packed it right here and on the day of Pentecost God quickened every bit of that right to 120 people he quickened all that word that they held and they died to their self sure Peter jumps up and says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of these sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for this promises to you and you children to them and the far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call so we baptize in a name the name of Jesus Christ which is this lamb what was the Lamb's name God only had one name if God the lamb and the Holy Ghost is the same person what's what's the Lamb's name Jesus Christ amen Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world who was standing on Earth Jesus Christ that's what John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world all right who's God Jesus Christ I come in my father's name mhm God's not a name father's not a name but Jesus Christ is a name that's what we identify all right and then also in number three but now look let's get one thing here and then we'll go the intelligence of man intelligence is not bad as long as you don't let it become a part of man's ideas right intelligence is not bad because Peter James and all them in the upper room if they had not heard right the word for 3 and 1/2 years spoke to them what that's what I saying about bread this is sustaining life to the bride it's not uh let's read something let's turn this seal book let's read it real quick I want you to see something right here 212 page 212 in this book third seal paragraph 56 and then we're going to read paragraph 111 all right paragraph 56 sister Johnny I I preached this in Wich last Sunday about the justification sanctification the justification the glorification the three steps of justification they really enjoyed really enjoyed it yeah I'm hot too just like paragraph 56 look just like take it on the other side there was people coming in who has heard power as kings but wasn't Kings see see you have to notice the Bible terminology of anything see now watch but this the reason that all the straying ends of the mysterious part about justification the mysterious part about sanctification the mysterious part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and why what kind did did he eat an apple or did she eat a pomegranate or something see was what was the serpent seed and oh as the baptism in the name of the father son and the name of the Lord Jesus right oh hundreds of those things has been left loose ended he's talking about it not being a great big show but up there above it he says why didn't these other men paragraph 55 Wesley Luther and other great reformers who brought out justification sanctification and the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and things why didn't they catch these these messages why didn't they get them because they were reformers that's right okay now God was doing a work of restoration mhm right but they were reformers they reformed the people Luther said to just shall live by faith but still drank beer and smoked the pie but God reformed him from the Catholic Church started restoration because when you get two shoots that is the corn plant it's just a different kind of life I mean not a different kind of Life sorry a different manifestation same life cuz the same life that put up two shoots is the same life that's going to make that air corn on the end where you going to get it from that's what I said before through the foolishness of preaching or the words of a man you're going to get perfected sorry that's just what God said he said he said I give you Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for what perfecting the Saints in other words giving you bread giving you oil giving you wine all right now now we don't give you the Holy Ghost and we don't give you a revelation but we give you the ability to hear what God has to say in a form you can understand mhm you understand that in form you can understand am there's intelligence in a form you can what understand break it down to the people cuz see here he says Luther had justification Wesley sanctification in paragraph here but look down to part it says mysterious part mysterious part justification mysterious mysterious part sanctification see the mysterious part is to me and you because justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost puts you in the body but that's just the earnest that's not the full possession the full possession is you're Justified and that person never did it start with and you're standing glorified in God's sight now let's read one more thing let's go over to one what I say 11 11 let's just let's just let brother brandham blow the doors off of this doctrine that we've been hearing about Adam seed and Eve the Sab and all this stuff listen to this I knew it was in here I just had read it in a while let's read verse let's read 110 the real human blood as human beings would be become incarnate god without sex virgin the Virgin birth produced that now God's word promises promise become blood and was incarnate in the person of Jesus Christ the Savior the BL bulls and goats and so forth but now wait here God made the promise say saying it would be there when it come her seed should bruise the Serpent's head now if her seed come just like from Adam or like it been from The Serpent and so forth then it still be sinful seed that's why I said there's nobody good know not one I don't care how righteous your parents are I don't care how righteous they were in the Old Testament they had to have a sacrifice and sure the father made a sacrifice for the daughter until she became a full age right until she was married that's the same way you know many times before you've heard me say it that you Joon Danny your hes Holy Ghost until she gets it I'm my daughter's Holy Ghost until she gets it if she lives in my house all right that's the truth yeah and you're the head yeah you're the head boys and girls don't matter but just for an example since we you know didn't Jo in here but for an example that's true you will be held accountable for what she does until she gets married now our leaves home and then you can't you know you can't you got to cut the cord but listen this if her seed came just like from Adam or like had been from The Serpent and so forth then it'd still be sinful seed that's the reason John wept there was no man because no man everybody was across the other side of the ditch the chasm but there's coming a time when this substitute blood of animal would be done away with when the real and carnate blood came God made God made Flesh and Blood all right so God had to come and what he have to do he had to die to release what I was just talking about the life not the literal blood you can be covered in it today you can just be poured with Jesus's blood and you still be just as rot and sinner as you can be yeah right but it was the life that was in that blood I got a little thought maybe that about believing that maybe I want to bring next Sunday I think that is going to be gone so believing do we really believe or is it just a mental attitude but brother R said the mental you know right mental attitude toward God or bring bring any promise to pass that's right but what if you're a born again believer and that blood is there for you see that's why that sanctification that second seal was so good showing that how God Sanctified you through what his blood and then now if you're Sanctified you're dead if you're dead your life is what hid in Christ I'm quoting scripture and Satan can't get in there the only way you can get in these people he figured out that hey I can't kill them physically cuz I'm just doing them a good deed I'm going to take and I'm going to take what these men say and I'm going to twist it just a little bit and I'm going to kill a whole lot more cuz they're going to sit in these big old churches and they're going to just die they're just going to be dead believeth thou this yes all right let's go see you next Sunday
