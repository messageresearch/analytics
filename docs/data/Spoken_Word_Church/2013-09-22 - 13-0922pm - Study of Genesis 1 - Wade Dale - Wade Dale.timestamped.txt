[30:30] decent if not we'll have it on the on
[30:32] the uh on the video
[30:35] so
[30:36] we kind of fixed it up all right it's
[30:38] kind of scrabbled up a little bit but
[30:39] it'll be okay Genesis 1 26 and 27 now uh
[30:43] by the way I have a couple announcements
[30:45] November the 2nd remember the
[30:48] um
[30:49] Fall Festival
[30:51] I talked to Dad the other day we're
[30:53] going to
[30:54] uh have a tournament
[30:57] and we're gonna have a BB gun tournament
[31:00] we're going to take we're going to get a
[31:02] couple BB guns and some of you want to
[31:03] uh we'll do it with girls and guys and
[31:06] we'll have a tournament and whoever wins
[31:08] we may just give them the BB gun so so
[31:10] we'll see about that but we're gonna
[31:12] have a little tournament
[31:14] and then everybody else can play games
[31:16] and whatever but I think we ought to
[31:18] have a little have a hard little
[31:20] shooting class
[31:22] no not your sister Brenda no no honey no
[31:26] it's for the younger ones not the ones
[31:28] that think they're young okay
[31:30] not those so just it's for the kids
[31:36] yeah thank you
[31:38] also remember Brother house said
[31:40] remember brother Rick everybody
[31:41] remembers brother Rick that used to come
[31:43] here he wants everybody to pray for him
[31:46] um from what I gather the information I
[31:48] got was that uh that Rick really saw
[31:51] something different than us
[31:53] and he wanted us to pray for him so so
[31:56] whatever shape he's in whatever he's
[31:58] done in the past you know
[32:00] he's still a child to God okay so let's
[32:03] just keep him in the prayers also
[32:06] another announcement um brother Boyd's
[32:08] class now he's getting a pretty good
[32:10] pretty good group in there 10 or 10 or
[32:12] 11. uh young adults from probably 10 or
[32:16] 12 up to 18 19 years old
[32:19] and he wants to tell you parents now
[32:23] remember one thing
[32:26] your parents had these kids right
[32:30] okay
[32:31] and brother Randall said you are their
[32:32] Holy Ghost
[32:33] until they get the Holy Ghost right
[32:36] it's not their decision what to do
[32:40] amen that's not the doctrine of this
[32:42] church that's not the doctrine of the
[32:44] Bible and that's not you I never heard
[32:46] brother Brown say that that kid can
[32:47] decide what he wants to do whenever he
[32:48] wants to do it no way now when he leaves
[32:51] and goes out of the house
[32:52] he can do whatever he wants to do but if
[32:54] he comes to this church he's going to do
[32:55] what the church has the rules of the
[32:57] church right
[32:58] nobody brought their Bible to his Sunday
[33:00] school class no kid brought their Bible
[33:03] to a Sunday school class when you come
[33:04] to Sunday school class kids bring your
[33:07] Bible amen amen parents
[33:09] tell your kids
[33:11] to bring the Bible
[33:14] one dead I'm sorry I wonder who did
[33:17] Michael did well praise the Lord the
[33:19] good Michael's going
[33:21] foreign
[33:26] but nine others didn't all right so
[33:30] let's shoot for 100 but you know really
[33:32] you do have to be the kids Holy Ghost
[33:34] you can't let them just do what they
[33:36] want to do all right so you are their
[33:38] Holy Ghost and you know what you're
[33:39] responsible until they decide to go
[33:42] somewhere else
[33:43] daddy told me one time he said son if
[33:45] you live in my house I don't care if
[33:47] you're 30 years old he said if you put
[33:49] your feet under my table see exactly
[33:51] what he said you put your feet under my
[33:52] table and you eat my food you're gonna
[33:54] do what I ask you to do that's just
[33:56] respect I mean that's that's the Bible
[33:58] That's The Prophet's message and that's
[34:00] what this church upholds so you are the
[34:03] Holy Ghost and you are responsible for
[34:04] your kids so that's with them going
[34:07] outside and playing that's with all the
[34:08] other things that goes on around here so
[34:10] don't think you can bring any other kind
[34:12] of Doctrine in this church because you
[34:13] can't do it all right we won't allow it
[34:16] but Genesis 1 26 and 27 I think that's
[34:19] all the announcements we have
[34:21] but just bring bring your Bibles it
[34:23] really helps brother boy
[34:25] because it helps me when when when the
[34:27] adults when where everybody's got their
[34:29] Bible and they're all we're doing
[34:30] responsive reading and it just really
[34:32] helps the teacher
[34:33] instead of him going well
[34:35] I'll tell you what the Bible says it's a
[34:36] lot better for you to read that's why
[34:37] we're going to do this and that's why
[34:38] we're going to do this all right because
[34:40] visual does help Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[34:44] let's bow our heads before we get
[34:46] started do you have any father we pray
[34:48] Lord today that you will come Among Us
[34:49] in a special way
[34:51] lead us and guide us by the Holy Spirit
[34:54] be the preeminent one Lord in the
[34:55] service and father you you do the
[34:58] speaking be the active participant Lord
[35:01] for need to hear the sick Lord we ask
[35:02] you to send the word and heal them now
[35:05] for anything going on now in their body
[35:08] Lord or or anything Lord that you just
[35:10] heal them now father take care of them
[35:12] Lord we know you're the Healer
[35:14] you're the Redeemer you're the all in
[35:16] all father
[35:17] we pray now that you take care of us
[35:19] lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit
[35:21] let it be the preeminent one in our life
[35:23] not just here Lord but in our homes
[35:26] and in our jobs and the things that we
[35:27] do Lord we pray that you just sanctifies
[35:29] Lord for our journey be with us and
[35:31] bless the ones that are not here the
[35:33] ones that are sick Lord be with sister
[35:34] Anna Canard but allow the ones that are
[35:36] home Lord we ask just to be with them
[35:37] Lord bless the ones that are watching in
[35:39] we pray now Lord that everything will be
[35:41] done for your honor and glory in Jesus
[35:42] Christ's name we pray and
[35:45] all right this is going to be a study on
[35:46] Genesis 1 26 and 27 of course most of
[35:49] you know me that's my favorite scripture
[35:51] and one I like to talk about and I was
[35:54] telling sister Trudy to science she was
[35:57] asking me about something I said don't
[35:59] ask me I said we'll talk about this
[36:01] afternoon
[36:02] but Dad and I really don't talk about
[36:05] these things as far as that goes as far
[36:07] as he's going to preach on this and I'm
[36:08] going to preach on that but this is
[36:09] really kind of kind of woven in and I'm
[36:12] sure he'll get to it and do a better job
[36:15] but I'm going to give you just a little
[36:16] bit of taste of what I see that's that
[36:19] helps me to understand because look
[36:22] brother Branham is not confused
[36:25] the Bible is not confused right right
[36:30] but you can take a two Soul Doctrine
[36:32] seven tons of virtue Doctrine perusia
[36:36] Doctrine son of man all those different
[36:38] doctrines and they have quotes to back
[36:40] that Doctrine up they get it from the
[36:42] message then they put their own
[36:44] interpretation to it
[36:46] like I was telling June the other day
[36:48] you you've got we've got this great
[36:50] message
[36:51] we've got this great picture like
[36:53] brother Brown said you've got a picture
[36:54] and you got a cow
[36:56] you've got the grass and you've got the
[36:58] tree
[36:59] so we have the message the Bible all
[37:01] those things to come together right
[37:03] right but now what if you got the cow
[37:04] eating grass in the top of the tree you
[37:07] got all the components you need for a
[37:08] beautiful picture but you've just
[37:10] misplaced that right word
[37:13] picture okay and that's just as bad all
[37:16] right that's not having the picture at
[37:18] all because you're deceiving the people
[37:20] so brother Brown was not deceived he is
[37:23] not if he changed the doctrine he
[37:25] changed it right
[37:27] right we don't need to change anything
[37:28] of his all right so we're not changing
[37:31] any doctrines like brother down said he
[37:33] quoted before brother Brown said I'm
[37:34] here to straighten out doctor not to
[37:36] make a new one but to straighten out the
[37:37] old one all right so listen let's read
[37:39] this and God said let us make man
[37:42] in our image after our likeness now that
[37:45] word image
[37:46] I'm going to get into something maybe
[37:48] later on
[37:49] I've been doing a little study of the
[37:52] DNA of God
[37:53] or the DNA of the Holy Ghost because
[37:55] that's what we're talking about today
[37:56] the seed of God not a natural seed but
[38:00] there is a the reason I act like I do is
[38:03] because I have the DNA of my parents
[38:05] so blame them
[38:08] but really the what I have but you can't
[38:12] see my DNA but you see what it displays
[38:15] okay so the Holy Ghost has a DNA God has
[38:18] a DNA all right God is DNA that's what
[38:22] he is he is the life strand but that's
[38:24] what that image because if we were born
[38:27] in the image of a dog we'd look like a
[38:28] dog but we were born in the image of God
[38:30] right all right
[38:31] after our lightness and let them plural
[38:34] have dominion over the fish of the Sea
[38:36] and the foul of the air and over the
[38:37] cattle and over all the Earth it didn't
[38:39] say some of the earth it said all the
[38:41] Earth all right and over every creeping
[38:43] thing that creepeth upon the Earth so
[38:45] God created man in his own image not
[38:48] another image in his own image in the
[38:50] image of God created he him
[38:53] male and female created he them you may
[38:57] be seated in the Lord that is blessing
[38:59] to the reading of the word and we're
[39:00] gonna
[39:01] we're going to look at the chart and I
[39:03] want you as I read and we we're gonna
[39:05] you're gonna have to don't look crop
[39:07] side
[39:08] but put one eye over here and one eye
[39:10] over here because I'm going to read you
[39:12] some quotes
[39:14] and we're going to look at the chart and
[39:16] we're going to see how that that if
[39:18] you'll notice if you can't see from the
[39:20] back this part here this is the fall
[39:24] you've heard of a fall line right this
[39:27] is the fall line
[39:28] this was above the fall and this is
[39:30] below the fall all right after the fall
[39:32] yeah all right so Genesis 1 26 and 27.
[39:35] now watch I want to show you the
[39:37] characteristics that I see and then I'm
[39:40] going to let brother Branham prove what
[39:42] I see all right Genesis 1 26 and 27 is
[39:45] the theophany of God amen amen
[39:49] amen
[39:50] it's the logos right
[39:55] the reason we can create a world and go
[39:57] live on it that lives in us right right
[39:59] if you're born again
[40:01] word form right
[40:03] right is that we're okay with this all
[40:07] right
[40:08] Christ
[40:10] right
[40:12] we're getting a lot less say man's hair
[40:13] creator
[40:19] because remember Genesis 1 26 and 27 is
[40:22] like Dad said as I was explaining
[40:25] um to Sister Trudy
[40:27] God is a Creator but it says in the
[40:29] beginning of the creation of God
[40:32] there is no creation of God in the form
[40:35] that we see where there's nothing then
[40:37] there's something right a car is a
[40:40] creation of man right
[40:43] but the components of that car was in
[40:46] the Garden of Eden that's right
[40:48] everybody got that right so a car was
[40:51] created out of the Earth
[40:53] but it was always there okay so now look
[40:56] at creation of that now watch but we we
[41:00] look at eternity and Elohim now we're
[41:02] coming down to think of all the
[41:04] background here foreknowledge
[41:06] this says predestinated not
[41:09] predestination
[41:10] hold on a man all right because remember
[41:14] predestination
[41:16] looks back to foreknowledge
[41:18] predestinated is a promise yes
[41:21] predestinated before the foundation
[41:23] world that is stamp that is settled that
[41:25] is done all right so now theophany of
[41:28] God the logos word form Christ Creator
[41:32] seed of God Amen okay Galatians 3 16.
[41:37] all right man
[41:39] not seasons of many not as a natural
[41:41] Abraham seed but as of what one seed
[41:46] which is Christ all right so now and
[41:49] this part of God
[41:51] always was eternal right
[41:55] not born on a certain day you remember
[41:58] in the quote
[41:59] right and it's a seed amen
[42:02] amen it's sinless
[42:04] man
[42:06] amen has no beginning
[42:09] and has no end
[42:12] okay
[42:13] that's what Genesis 1 26-27 man is
[42:18] in a nutshell
[42:20] you can put bride in there and you can
[42:22] put the children of God but that's
[42:24] exactly what that is
[42:26] all right but now look
[42:28] that was a part of God
[42:31] are the an amorphy of God that he was
[42:34] coming to
[42:36] because we were supposed to come through
[42:37] Adam and Eve
[42:39] come down through Adam and Eve
[42:42] and actually this was in
[42:46] Adam
[42:47] and Eve
[42:49] right
[42:51] okay you're not asleep yet
[42:52] this was in Adam and Eve
[42:56] all right
[42:58] because he was to he had the ability
[43:03] to bring us all into being
[43:06] had there not been a fall
[43:08] right okay now look let's read now let's
[43:11] start with number one
[43:15] and before we get started let me read
[43:17] this it's not up here
[43:20] but let me read this from the future
[43:21] home uh dad quoted it the other night
[43:23] but let me read it exactly brother
[43:24] around them on the future home this is
[43:26] 1964. after the seals was open
[43:30] right
[43:31] he's talking about paragraph 78 he led
[43:35] he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in
[43:38] Us by three stages of Grace
[43:41] just like he led the world in three
[43:43] stages to come to the world as God will
[43:45] come to the world after it's gone
[43:46] through three different stages of
[43:47] purification that's exactly how he comes
[43:50] to us through three stages of Grace I
[43:53] taught that at the beginning I've never
[43:55] changed since
[43:57] it's God's word so brother Branham did
[44:00] not and I talked to a guy not too long
[44:02] brother a lot too long ago that said
[44:04] that brother Brown changed his way of
[44:05] the new birth after the seals open
[44:08] no I say you got a greater revelation
[44:12] we all do
[44:16] audition but he didn't change the way
[44:17] you're born again you can't change
[44:19] because look the last quote he said he
[44:21] says it's God's word so you can't change
[44:23] God's word brother Brown didn't come to
[44:26] change God's word
[44:27] he came to make it more plain what we
[44:30] can realize where we come from
[44:32] and where we're going back to okay I
[44:36] come from this
[44:38] now I'm going back to this
[44:40] I come from God I'm going back to God
[44:42] very simple but you got to take the
[44:44] quote that brother Branham gives
[44:46] and I'm going to give you some quotes
[44:47] that seem maybe a little different
[44:50] I once was a kookaburra now I'm a wheat
[44:53] right
[44:56] I once was lost but now I'm found
[44:59] but I always was eternal if I have
[45:01] eternal life okay
[45:03] I wasn't born on no certain day
[45:06] you were not Sons you got it by the by
[45:09] the birth you were
[45:11] already in this form but you got to
[45:15] remember
[45:15] I'll read you a quote in a minute where
[45:17] brother Brown said your eternal life
[45:18] begins at the altar now was he that
[45:20] confused
[45:22] I don't think so it's the mind of man
[45:25] that's confused trying to that's what
[45:27] I'm saying about quotes quotes will kill
[45:29] you without a revelation
[45:31] uh they can quote you to death with the
[45:33] the seven Thunders the the paruges the
[45:36] two Soul doctrines where'd they get it
[45:37] from they got it from quotes in the
[45:39] message same way with what Dad was
[45:41] saying this morning about father son
[45:42] Holy Ghost and Lord Jesus Christ they're
[45:44] both there they're both quotes in the
[45:45] Bible
[45:46] but it takes a revelation to put them
[45:48] together so now number one this is
[45:50] questions and answers on Genesis 19 53.
[45:52] now if God created man in his own image
[45:55] and his own likeness what kind of man
[45:57] did he create
[45:59] a spirit man
[46:01] all right now it's Genesis 1. that's
[46:02] what he's talking about all right
[46:04] now if you'll notice after he had made
[46:06] all the creation and created a spirit
[46:09] man
[46:10] the close reading of this now to the
[46:11] ones asked the question will find this
[46:13] that God give dominion to the cattle
[46:14] fish and everything to the man but in
[46:18] his making up there he made him in made
[46:20] man in his own image to lead the cattle
[46:22] lead the beasts of the field just like
[46:25] the Holy Spirit
[46:27] leads the Believers today
[46:30] and I want to tell you something that is
[46:32] the Holy Spirit
[46:35] that is the Holy Ghost
[46:37] okay
[46:39] now
[46:40] he was in other words
[46:42] Adam the first man in the lower
[46:44] creations of God the first creation was
[46:47] God himself
[46:49] now
[46:50] God is the creator
[46:54] he can't create himself in the form we
[46:57] want to think that he created himself
[46:59] it's like he was nothing and then he was
[47:01] here it's like the analogy and some of
[47:03] you are new and and and have not seen
[47:05] this before but if you condemn these
[47:07] lights down
[47:09] to where all you could see was just my
[47:11] form
[47:13] just imagine for just a moment you you
[47:16] all the lights are dim and all you see
[47:18] is a dark form
[47:20] but you raise the lights up a little bit
[47:22] now I haven't changed
[47:26] but you don't know whether I'm white or
[47:28] black
[47:29] green purple orange but as the light
[47:32] comes on more
[47:34] you maybe see that hey he's a lighter
[47:36] colored man
[47:38] oh he's a man
[47:40] oh he's got black hair used to be
[47:45] Danny don't say a word
[47:50] you got enough on that side of you over
[47:52] there
[47:53] but you see what I'm saying I I always
[47:55] was
[47:57] a man
[47:59] a human white
[48:01] -headed but you didn't see it in that
[48:04] way you only saw a form
[48:07] am I making sense but as the light comes
[48:11] on
[48:12] you see more of my features
[48:15] as the light comes on you're going to
[48:17] see more of my features
[48:20] okay all right so you're going to see
[48:22] more of me
[48:24] that's why in the
[48:26] in the end time the light is the
[48:29] brightest it's ever been but it's so
[48:31] small
[48:32] because it's only a small amount of
[48:33] people that's going to see the full
[48:35] light and realize who they were now I
[48:39] realize this is me
[48:42] but I realized that was me
[48:48] I don't know about you
[48:49] but when I was doing the things of the
[48:51] world I wasn't thinking about God
[48:54] now he was thinking to me he had me
[48:55] right here
[48:57] but I wasn't thinking of him
[49:00] I was lost doomed
[49:03] and on my way to hell
[49:04] because if you look right here brother
[49:07] Branham never took free moral agency and
[49:09] choice out of his quotes all the way up
[49:11] to 1965. man is put on free moral agency
[49:14] so don't tell me you don't have a choice
[49:17] but God knew the choice you would make
[49:20] therefore he can make a choice
[49:23] you know God made a choice brother Dale
[49:24] read it this morning he had a plan and a
[49:26] purpose ain't had a choice right he
[49:28] chose what to do
[49:29] all right so now
[49:32] the first creation was God himself in
[49:34] other words he was starting to unveil
[49:37] what he what he was not what he was
[49:39] going to be but what he was what he
[49:41] always was all right then out of God
[49:43] came to logos
[49:47] which was the son of God then out of the
[49:49] logos which was the word now watch he's
[49:52] talking about Genesis 1 26 man because
[49:55] if you'll read the quote up above it
[49:57] then out of the logos which was the word
[50:01] in the beginning was the word words with
[50:03] God and Word was God and the Word was
[50:05] made flesh and dwelt among us out of the
[50:07] logos came forth
[50:09] the man
[50:13] right so logos was the Genesis 1 26 man
[50:16] that's what he said right here out of
[50:18] the logos
[50:19] came the man right
[50:22] number two
[50:27] you'll like the way I colored this up
[50:29] they didn't do that I did
[50:31] kind of cute huh
[50:33] okay
[50:35] let's go let me before we go any further
[50:38] this is adoption 1960. brother Brown I'm
[50:42] on the adoption series I don't care if
[50:44] it was before the seals or after the
[50:46] seals that was the adoption series he
[50:48] was trying to bring people to a place
[50:50] all right so the same way I told them
[50:54] when we were talking about Daniel 70
[50:55] weeks uh I drive a I drive a Volvo now
[50:59] if something's wrong with my Volvo I
[51:00] don't want to go buy uh uh a book about
[51:04] a Ford
[51:06] I wouldn't buy a book about a Ford
[51:07] anyway
[51:08] book about a Ford
[51:10] to fix my Volvo
[51:13] right right that's why they were saying
[51:15] oh well you need to take this Daniel 70
[51:17] weeks book and chunk it out of the way
[51:18] and just take what he said after the
[51:20] seals
[51:21] now
[51:22] a man spent three services
[51:26] same thing on the adoption series he
[51:28] spent service after service and he was
[51:30] wrong
[51:31] come on people good grief you just can't
[51:34] put the word together
[51:35] short drives you crazy
[51:37] let me before we go any further go back
[51:39] Genesis 1 26 I'll pick it up Wednesday
[51:42] when God made man before he made man he
[51:45] called himself
[51:47] llh Ella Elohim the word means in the
[51:50] Hebrews the self-existing all by himself
[51:53] nothing existed before him he was all
[51:56] the existence there ever was amen
[51:59] self-existent one L Elohim means the
[52:03] all-sufficient all-powerful almighty
[52:05] self-existing one
[52:07] all right now look he's still talking
[52:09] about Genesis 1.
[52:12] 26 and 27 because watch his next quote
[52:14] but in Genesis 2.
[52:18] now he didn't make spirit man in Genesis
[52:20] too
[52:21] he made flesh man in Genesis 2. right
[52:24] and put the spirit man into the flesh
[52:26] man so he's talking about even the
[52:29] self-existing God just like uh I don't
[52:32] have it up here but I was going to write
[52:33] it I had it in my notes but I didn't put
[52:34] it up there 30 times in the Book of
[52:36] Genesis the word God is used which is
[52:39] Elohim right
[52:40] which in Genesis 1 26 and 27 God God God
[52:44] God God
[52:47] then in Genesis 2 7 it says Lord God
[52:49] which is what he's talking about now
[52:53] Yahoo j-u-v-u-h Yahweh or Jehovah
[52:57] because now it's a self-existing one
[52:59] that has a family but now he he made a
[53:01] part of himself
[53:03] before the Genesis 2 man he made a part
[53:06] of himself but he was still
[53:07] self-existing
[53:13] I'm gonna let that soak in
[53:15] because this is not a separate part of
[53:17] him
[53:21] it's more of him
[53:25] that you can see
[53:27] and understand
[53:30] okay
[53:31] so the Genesis 1 man even in its
[53:34] plurality
[53:36] created he them right
[53:38] right in in that plurality of that
[53:41] creation or unfolding
[53:44] he steals God
[53:45] self-existing all by himself
[53:51] because it's him right
[53:55] okay
[53:56] but now but in Genesis 2 when he made
[53:58] man he said I am
[54:01] y-a-h-u-j-u-v-u-h yahu yahuwah Jehovah
[54:04] what did it mean I am the all-existent
[54:06] one who has created something off of
[54:09] myself to be a son of mine
[54:11] or a temporary or amateur little one of
[54:15] mine Oh Glory why he gave him Jehovah
[54:18] means he gave man to be an amateur God
[54:20] because he is the father God and he made
[54:21] a man an amateur God so he isn't
[54:23] self-existing anymore he exists with his
[54:25] family now that's Genesis 2 when he put
[54:27] that one 26th man into the 2-7 man
[54:31] to walk on the Earth right all right
[54:33] everybody got that say amen amen all
[54:35] right Ella Ella Elohim now now he is
[54:38] Jehovah Jehovah means the one who exists
[54:41] with his family right all right so there
[54:45] was a there was a creation of God an
[54:48] unfolding of God or a revelation of God
[54:51] not separate to God
[54:55] it's God
[54:57] in morphing
[54:59] God in another form
[55:01] all right
[55:02] and then we know
[55:04] if you've been around here long enough
[55:05] you know that when that 126 man was put
[55:08] in the 2-7 man and given three moral
[55:11] agency that's when like what brother
[55:12] Dale was on this morning that's when man
[55:14] fell right all right and there was no
[55:17] way because
[55:19] this was
[55:21] sinless
[55:22] No Beginning No End
[55:25] eternal
[55:26] didn't know a thing about sin because
[55:28] it's God
[55:30] now how could this
[55:32] supersede this listen hang on a minute
[55:34] how could this supersede this one in
[55:36] Genesis 3 he said I'll put enmity
[55:39] right there's a block there
[55:42] and God put it there
[55:44] he used to walk with Adam and Eve just
[55:46] like I would walk with my wife just walk
[55:48] right down through the garden and just
[55:50] talk to him now what happened after that
[55:55] there's no other way that God could do
[55:57] that again
[55:58] except come back and we'll talk about
[56:01] that in a minute
[56:02] through the atonement because what's the
[56:04] first thing he done kill the ant kill
[56:05] the animals
[56:07] right
[56:08] through the skins in what making an
[56:10] atonement all right but he'd already
[56:12] made the atonement back up here right
[56:15] amen
[56:17] so it was all covered
[56:19] Lamb slain before the foundation of the
[56:20] world see this is all before the
[56:22] foundation of the world right here
[56:24] all right
[56:26] so now let's go to number three the
[56:27] Messiah 1961. now Isaiah 9 6.
[56:32] we just want we just won't read it but
[56:35] he was to be the Everlasting father of
[56:37] the Mighty God when God made man in
[56:39] Genesis 1 26 it shows if you put a
[56:42] scripture down Genesis 1 26 it shows
[56:44] that God made man to be a God to begin
[56:46] with
[56:48] man was made to be God a Lesser God he
[56:51] was made in the image and likeness of
[56:53] God he had
[56:56] had what
[56:59] he had hands like God
[57:02] he had feet like God
[57:04] eyes ears and
[57:07] intelligence
[57:09] like God right
[57:12] right Amen to that listen to this his
[57:16] whole fiber
[57:19] that means all from head to toe his
[57:22] whole fiber because he was a Son of God
[57:25] and the Jesus referred to him as God
[57:28] remember Jesus comes and says hey hey
[57:30] can you contem condemn me have sinned
[57:33] when it says
[57:35] that your prophets are Gods roll it up
[57:37] to get the end of the quote here
[57:39] just reading the blue for the same time
[57:41] and in Genesis 1 26 when God made man he
[57:44] made him a God because he gave him a
[57:46] dominion and he had rulership all right
[57:50] which is the Earth all right is that
[57:51] correct gave him dominion and rulership
[57:54] now let's go to number four
[57:57] questions and answers on Genesis back
[57:59] 1953 that's a good one to uh
[58:02] listen to or read if you want to study
[58:05] some more about Genesis 1. all right now
[58:07] the first man now he made the first man
[58:09] in His image and we're returning back
[58:12] to that image amen
[58:16] come from here
[58:18] going back to here
[58:21] actually this come here
[58:24] it didn't stay up in glory
[58:26] this came here
[58:28] all right we'll get into that in a
[58:29] minute if we have time
[58:31] because this is a study on Genesis 1. we
[58:34] won't finish it today we finish it maybe
[58:36] later on
[58:37] but we're returning back to that image
[58:39] what the image God created where the
[58:42] whole fiber all that quote up above
[58:44] there the whole fiber everything about
[58:45] that person is God
[58:48] that's right to our first created image
[58:53] Genesis 1.
[58:54] when God created me William Branham
[58:58] I was before the foundation of the world
[59:00] he made my being my spirit right now
[59:05] remember this is 1953 brother Brown
[59:07] flip-flop spirit and soul right right he
[59:10] said he said that the spirit was the
[59:12] inside realm Faith or doubt and then
[59:14] when he changed that it's still Faith or
[59:16] doubt so he made my being my spirit I
[59:19] wasn't conscious of anything as far as I
[59:21] know of
[59:22] you see you understand
[59:24] you didn't know
[59:26] but see now we know that's why we can
[59:28] look at job
[59:31] where the sons of God shouted for joy we
[59:33] can look back
[59:36] through the word we can look back where
[59:39] we came from exactly and say yeah I was
[59:42] shouting up there because I was in the
[59:44] DNA of the Almighty
[59:48] okay we'll get into something in a
[59:51] minute
[59:52] but I wasn't conscious of anything as
[59:53] far as I know of but I was there now not
[59:56] the William Branham that came here
[1:00:00] The Flash William Branham
[1:00:02] that wasn't back there
[1:00:05] but if your soul ever was eternal
[1:00:08] if you had a new birth
[1:00:10] it was back there okay because when in
[1:00:13] Genesis 1 that's what he created all
[1:00:15] right
[1:00:18] oh I don't believe you're getting it but
[1:00:20] now just a minute Jesus told the
[1:00:22] disciples that he knew them before the
[1:00:23] foundation in the world
[1:00:25] and Paul said here that he chose us in
[1:00:27] him
[1:00:29] see in him before the world began now
[1:00:32] there was some part of me Orman Neville
[1:00:34] and the rest of you all here that's in
[1:00:37] Jesus Christ before the world ever begun
[1:00:43] amen absolutely if you have eternal life
[1:00:47] that eternal life was there
[1:00:49] Amen in the DNA of God
[1:00:53] not you as a person there was no way you
[1:00:56] could find me or Terence or Anna in my
[1:00:59] daddy at any one time except for one
[1:01:02] time
[1:01:04] but it had to take an act to get us here
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:12] but whatever DNA He Is We Are
[1:01:17] same way with God the only thing with
[1:01:19] Dad and Mom they didn't know how many
[1:01:20] kids they were going to have if they did
[1:01:22] it only had one
[1:01:25] or two maybe but the middle one
[1:01:28] tell you what we keep singing that
[1:01:29] birthday song just a little bit more
[1:01:32] I can't believe he deceived them kids
[1:01:33] into doing that
[1:01:36] but anyway
[1:01:39] what was I talking about oh DNA
[1:01:42] but I was but now you can take his DNA
[1:01:45] in My DNA and prove that I was in him
[1:01:47] somewhere
[1:01:49] what do you say some part of me
[1:01:52] got it
[1:01:55] was in him
[1:01:56] when he was a kid
[1:01:59] because it's a DNA strain not just a
[1:02:01] little excuse my language the little
[1:02:03] sperm right everybody got that
[1:02:06] so it's not that
[1:02:08] it's what come from here you were in
[1:02:10] your great great grandfather what in DNA
[1:02:12] not in right right sperm or germ or
[1:02:15] whatever it's in gene form
[1:02:18] and we've got to be reading this was our
[1:02:20] generation right here
[1:02:23] this was our gening of God but it got
[1:02:26] lost
[1:02:28] and we got to be regioned
[1:02:31] who was that Paul said follow me in the
[1:02:33] Regeneration what were you saying we're
[1:02:34] trying to get back up here
[1:02:36] and that don't mean up here that means
[1:02:38] back to that
[1:02:39] right everybody got that say Amen okay
[1:02:42] so uh you know I just and if anybody
[1:02:45] sees this uh you know the the situation
[1:02:48] we had a few weeks ago where I preached
[1:02:49] somewhere else and of course they didn't
[1:02:51] agree with what was going on but
[1:02:53] you know I I can't I'm not gonna
[1:02:57] fight people and argue or it doesn't do
[1:02:59] a bit of good to do that it's just
[1:03:01] sitting there throwing quotes at each
[1:03:03] other you know if you don't have a
[1:03:04] revelation that's what I told him
[1:03:05] downstairs
[1:03:07] not a reflection of
[1:03:10] of just because Dad's my dad
[1:03:13] but there's not many preachers
[1:03:16] in this message this is going out
[1:03:18] wherever there's not many preachers that
[1:03:20] I know of I can't name many that can
[1:03:22] take seemingly the quotes that are
[1:03:24] contrary
[1:03:26] and the quotes that they use or whoever
[1:03:29] uses to produce a false Doctrine can be
[1:03:33] brought together and made a beautiful
[1:03:34] picture I can't I don't see people doing
[1:03:36] that
[1:03:37] I see this group of people using their
[1:03:40] quotes
[1:03:41] and throwing the rest out
[1:03:43] but we've got a pastor that takes the
[1:03:45] quotes over here and the quotes over
[1:03:46] here that seems odd or different
[1:03:49] and shows how that they can come
[1:03:51] together well what a great thing to have
[1:03:54] and to me it just takes care of all the
[1:03:56] confusion
[1:03:57] because you know what
[1:03:59] brother Branham did say some things to
[1:04:01] confuse people you know what the Bible
[1:04:04] said
[1:04:05] and now what scripture says
[1:04:07] to confuse the wise and prudent right to
[1:04:10] confuse people he had brother he has us
[1:04:13] say things
[1:04:16] brother Brown said he'd let a brother
[1:04:17] say something kind of off to you to see
[1:04:19] how you'd react to it now that's pretty
[1:04:20] strong
[1:04:22] to see how you would react not even not
[1:04:24] anything on the brother but he's one
[1:04:25] that's seemingly wrong and he won't see
[1:04:27] how you react to it
[1:04:29] that's brotherly kindness we ain't got
[1:04:31] to do that yet
[1:04:34] now there was some part of me Orman
[1:04:36] Neville and the rest of y'all here
[1:04:37] that's in Christ Jesus not identities in
[1:04:41] Christ
[1:04:42] in Christ
[1:04:45] before the world ever began and here's
[1:04:47] to my analysis of that
[1:04:50] I think that the people today that are
[1:04:53] possessed with this Spirit or the spirit
[1:04:54] a part of these Angelic beings Spirits
[1:04:56] which rotated off of God that never fell
[1:04:58] in the beginning and resisted the
[1:04:59] devil's lie in heaven now he keeps going
[1:05:01] on down I cut a little bit of that out
[1:05:04] for save time
[1:05:05] but what she says right here there's the
[1:05:08] whole plan laying right there how God
[1:05:11] created me in the beginning
[1:05:13] watch created me in the beginning not me
[1:05:16] in the beginning
[1:05:18] got it my mom and dad give me this
[1:05:22] right God give me this okay all right
[1:05:24] and that was before that always was
[1:05:27] eternal that never sin that never had a
[1:05:28] day it was bad or a day that was good it
[1:05:31] was always good all right
[1:05:34] there's the whole plan how God created
[1:05:36] me in the beginning I came down here on
[1:05:38] the Earth
[1:05:40] taken my place as a gospel preacher are
[1:05:42] you as a man or woman to Salvation
[1:05:47] not that you came here always Eternal or
[1:05:49] that you came here like he was talking
[1:05:51] about here he says he said you came here
[1:05:54] I came taken my place as a gospel
[1:05:56] preacher or you as a man or woman to
[1:05:58] Salvation when you live the life by the
[1:06:01] grace of God
[1:06:03] Hallelujah and that same Spirit leaves
[1:06:06] here
[1:06:07] that was back there in the beginning
[1:06:10] I'll go back to the conscience of
[1:06:13] knowing I've been here hallelujah
[1:06:16] because those people in that sixth
[1:06:18] dimension
[1:06:20] told Brother random what he was on Earth
[1:06:23] so they didn't lose their consciousness
[1:06:25] of Earth
[1:06:27] after they'd already passed on right
[1:06:30] they actually picked up
[1:06:33] more knowledge
[1:06:36] right they picked up more knowledge
[1:06:39] of being on the Earth
[1:06:42] all right I'll go I'll go back to the
[1:06:45] conscious of knowing I've been here
[1:06:47] hallelujah and then wait there unto the
[1:06:49] altar blessed forever and rest and then
[1:06:52] when returning back I take up my body in
[1:06:55] its very peak of best before death ever
[1:06:58] Struck it all right so there's the plan
[1:07:01] of it
[1:07:03] somewhere in God I was created
[1:07:09] and if I'm down here just playing
[1:07:11] something different
[1:07:13] I wasn't here right
[1:07:16] right all right or I don't have this yet
[1:07:19] right
[1:07:21] because see he put the enmity the
[1:07:23] division the death the separation that's
[1:07:25] all happened in Genesis 3.
[1:07:28] after what happened with the even the
[1:07:30] Beast and after what happened with Even
[1:07:31] Adam
[1:07:32] God said I'll put enmity
[1:07:34] you're going to do this you're going to
[1:07:36] do that another Covenant came into being
[1:07:38] but death came into being no death up
[1:07:40] here
[1:07:41] death came into being separation came
[1:07:44] into being in sin now tell me how you're
[1:07:46] going to come here with all with
[1:07:48] eternal and have all that
[1:07:51] I was reading the other day where
[1:07:52] brother or went to the quote where
[1:07:54] brother Brown said the unclean Spirit
[1:07:55] goes out of sanctification right
[1:07:58] if you always was eternal
[1:08:00] and you were born with eternal life like
[1:08:02] I heard a preacher say
[1:08:08] how you gonna put something clean and
[1:08:10] something unclean or something unclean
[1:08:11] or something clean
[1:08:13] no I just like to believe we're lost
[1:08:16] I just like to believe that I was dead
[1:08:19] I was on my way to hell and somebody
[1:08:23] somebody came by my way and you know
[1:08:25] what I accepted that call
[1:08:29] you know God comes calling we don't go
[1:08:31] looking for God he comes calling but you
[1:08:33] know what
[1:08:36] he's going to call everybody
[1:08:40] if he doesn't he's a respecter of
[1:08:42] persons
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:45] he's going to call somewhere and you're
[1:08:46] going to make a choice
[1:08:48] because there's no judgment without
[1:08:51] choice
[1:08:53] right there's no judgment there's no
[1:08:55] reason to have a judgment seat
[1:08:58] there's no reason for Christ to die on a
[1:09:00] cross because he took the judgment
[1:09:02] of me
[1:09:05] on itself
[1:09:09] to get that unclean out
[1:09:12] and put some clean in
[1:09:14] suring the plan and in the and then the
[1:09:17] foreknowledge and I'm trying to pick my
[1:09:20] words right into in the mind of God
[1:09:23] this down here didn't happen
[1:09:26] remember there's a blood covering
[1:09:29] right if God saw us now in this
[1:09:31] condition that I've killed every one of
[1:09:33] us
[1:09:34] but remember the blood
[1:09:36] so if we come here always Eternal why do
[1:09:38] we need the blood cover
[1:09:40] I don't I just don't understand that I
[1:09:43] just want to be lost and found
[1:09:46] what greater God than just somebody
[1:09:48] going I'm going to pull you through a
[1:09:50] tube
[1:09:52] and I'm going to make you do this
[1:09:55] sure God's Sovereign God can do whatever
[1:09:57] he wants to do but God chose to do it
[1:10:00] this way
[1:10:02] and his foreknowledge is because of the
[1:10:04] choice we made down here
[1:10:06] that's just you know what it's too
[1:10:09] simple
[1:10:10] it's too simple
[1:10:12] for a mind that thinks way up here
[1:10:16] to just think so simple how that yeah I
[1:10:19] was lost
[1:10:21] and some great supreme Supreme Being
[1:10:23] came and
[1:10:25] gave me a part of his life
[1:10:27] right
[1:10:29] get to turn your phone off
[1:10:32] geez
[1:10:36] that time for me to quit or what
[1:10:39] okay
[1:10:45] thank God we won't need them things when
[1:10:47] we get over there
[1:10:49] hey
[1:10:50] you know why you know that's a
[1:10:52] pre-figure
[1:10:54] television is a vision
[1:10:58] what do you think brother Brown was
[1:10:59] looking at what do you think Moses were
[1:11:01] looking at when he looked back in the
[1:11:02] Garden of Eden God had a camera
[1:11:04] somewhere what which was his
[1:11:06] intelligence his eyes
[1:11:09] God saw what happened in Genesis and he
[1:11:11] just took it over and said Moses look
[1:11:13] what happened
[1:11:14] turn to channel five
[1:11:17] and you'll pick up what happened well I
[1:11:19] believe what Moses saw what happened
[1:11:20] don't you I mean he just didn't write
[1:11:22] down I believe he had a vision
[1:11:24] like brother Bradham had a vision he
[1:11:26] said I see you as an older person what
[1:11:28] was he looking through
[1:11:32] right Big Brother ain't got nothing on
[1:11:34] Jesus Christ
[1:11:35] thank you
[1:11:37] You Can't Hide a little bit from Big
[1:11:38] Brother but you can't hide from big God
[1:11:41] I'll go back to the conscious of knowing
[1:11:43] I've been here hallelujah and then wait
[1:11:45] there under the altar bless forever and
[1:11:46] rest and then return back I take up my
[1:11:49] body and it's very peak of best before
[1:11:50] death ever Struck it all right so we got
[1:11:54] that now let's go to number five
[1:11:57] this is questions and answers on Hebrews
[1:11:59] 1957.
[1:12:01] that's Genesis 1 where he created man in
[1:12:04] his own image which was in
[1:12:07] see I'm trying to get the quote so it'll
[1:12:09] prove he calls Genesis 1 26 man what
[1:12:13] theophany
[1:12:15] all right theophany of God right and in
[1:12:18] Genesis 2 he made Man Out of the Dust of
[1:12:20] the earth which was a human man that we
[1:12:22] have now and then there was a fall and
[1:12:24] he keeps going through but let's go to
[1:12:25] number six Hebrews chapter four I want
[1:12:28] to read a few of these quotes and then
[1:12:29] we'll
[1:12:30] make some comments but I want you to
[1:12:31] make sure that I just didn't pull these
[1:12:33] out of the
[1:12:35] out of my hat somewhere just think of it
[1:12:38] is there two eternal life this is 1957
[1:12:40] Hebrews chapter four
[1:12:42] you couldn't answer that could you there
[1:12:44] is one eternal life and that's the life
[1:12:46] of God this other kind of life no matter
[1:12:48] what it is it's got to have an end to it
[1:12:51] so there is two lives right
[1:12:54] okay you got your natural life in the
[1:12:55] spiritual life all right
[1:12:57] kind of simple
[1:12:58] anything that had a beginning has to
[1:13:00] happen in but anything that had no
[1:13:02] beginning
[1:13:05] right
[1:13:07] has no end and God said he would give us
[1:13:10] give us eternal life
[1:13:13] without beginning we were just made a
[1:13:16] part of him and actually the life that's
[1:13:18] in US wasn't brought here by human
[1:13:21] nature
[1:13:23] now that does away with the natural
[1:13:25] birth
[1:13:26] are you having anything by the natural
[1:13:28] birth
[1:13:29] you're born dead I'll read it here in
[1:13:31] just a second nature gives us a spirit
[1:13:34] but that Spirit died and we got the
[1:13:37] spirit of God right
[1:13:39] now where you got always was eternal in
[1:13:41] there that spirit of God always was
[1:13:43] eternal but you weren't
[1:13:46] glory to God was God a man certainly
[1:13:50] let us make man in our own image what
[1:13:52] was God a theophany a body and their man
[1:13:56] was made like that and put Over the
[1:13:58] Garden but there was no man in the till
[1:14:00] the soil in the senses then he created
[1:14:02] man Out of the Dust of the Earth in the
[1:14:04] animal life and that man till the soil
[1:14:07] and man fell by transgression correctly
[1:14:10] and God the theophany
[1:14:14] God's a theophany look over here saying
[1:14:17] God the theophany done what
[1:14:21] all this came in Christ
[1:14:24] Jesus Christ
[1:14:26] okay all this there wasn't a part of
[1:14:29] this that stayed up here when Christ
[1:14:30] came this all came
[1:14:32] he's the sinless one he had no beginning
[1:14:35] or no end what was inside of him you got
[1:14:37] it he was the theophany of God right he
[1:14:41] was the logos you are the creator of God
[1:14:44] he was word form
[1:14:49] one more time he was word form he came
[1:14:52] according to what the word said he was
[1:14:54] word form that's why he said before he
[1:14:57] could say before Abraham was I am you
[1:15:01] and I can't say that not in the form
[1:15:03] we're in now all right but in word form
[1:15:06] he knew all things I'll read it quote in
[1:15:09] a minute
[1:15:10] this was Christ
[1:15:12] because remember he was Jesus Christ
[1:15:14] there was a lot of Jesus's
[1:15:16] but he was Jesus Christ when he was born
[1:15:18] all right he was born he was a Creator
[1:15:22] he was the seed of God he was that one
[1:15:24] seed which is Christ he always was
[1:15:27] eternal he wasn't born on a certain day
[1:15:30] the Christ Jesus the man was but to
[1:15:33] Christ all right and he was the seed of
[1:15:36] God absolutely no doubt all right
[1:15:39] now look
[1:15:41] in the beginning was the word
[1:15:45] this too strong for you
[1:15:49] that you think you know I had to stay I
[1:15:52] thought well Genesis 1 26 was just the
[1:15:56] eternal life that God puts in me at the
[1:15:58] at the new birth and
[1:16:00] and I'm a Child of God well you're all
[1:16:02] that too
[1:16:06] dick
[1:16:08] that's why you can go create a world
[1:16:11] you know what
[1:16:12] and this is what the Lord showed me the
[1:16:14] other day I told him I told him down in
[1:16:15] the uh Sunday school class I said I had
[1:16:18] to get a new lawnmower because the one I
[1:16:19] was on took a rapture
[1:16:21] because I was preaching to it and it
[1:16:22] just went out of here and I gotta have
[1:16:23] to get another one but now I can do some
[1:16:25] real
[1:16:26] real thinking on those things especially
[1:16:27] when you got a big yard and you don't
[1:16:28] have to go around anything you just go
[1:16:30] back and forth
[1:16:32] actually a little mundane to people but
[1:16:34] not to me I can sit there and think
[1:16:36] but all this right here
[1:16:39] the reason we understand what we
[1:16:41] understand in this end time and brother
[1:16:43] Brown is going to tell you he's going to
[1:16:44] say thank God for the opening of those
[1:16:45] seals why because all this now Wesley
[1:16:51] had all this
[1:16:55] Luther
[1:16:56] had all this
[1:16:59] Paul had all this
[1:17:02] but he never said in the scriptures that
[1:17:04] you are the theophany of God
[1:17:06] did he
[1:17:07] did he ever explain this word logos
[1:17:14] did he
[1:17:16] but we
[1:17:19] buy the new birth and the revelation of
[1:17:22] the opening of all the word not just
[1:17:24] part of it all the word we can look
[1:17:26] right back up and see that all this
[1:17:30] is in here
[1:17:32] and each characteristic
[1:17:35] brings itself that's how we're going to
[1:17:38] get a new body
[1:17:41] it's not the one that was created by Mom
[1:17:43] and Daddy
[1:17:44] you say you gotta we got to create a new
[1:17:46] body no but to create her inside of us
[1:17:49] it's not going to just read Gene the
[1:17:51] soul
[1:17:53] he's going to Regine the jeans
[1:17:56] that Mom and Daddy gave you that's my
[1:17:58] brother Brown said I'm not the son of
[1:17:59] Charles and Ella Branham what he saw
[1:18:00] that he was being regenerated
[1:18:03] by the almighty not by his mom and daddy
[1:18:05] all right
[1:18:07] now look
[1:18:08] actually the life that was that where I
[1:18:11] was at
[1:18:12] was God a man certainly
[1:18:14] let us make man our own image what was
[1:18:16] God a theophany of body and their man
[1:18:19] was made like that and put Over the
[1:18:20] Garden but there's no man to till the
[1:18:21] soil in the senses then he created man
[1:18:23] Out of the Dust of the Earth the animal
[1:18:24] life and that man till the soul and when
[1:18:26] man fell by transgression correctly and
[1:18:29] God the theophany came down and was made
[1:18:30] flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:18:32] to do what redeem means to bring back
[1:18:35] all right
[1:18:36] the man excuse me now let's go to number
[1:18:38] seven
[1:18:40] the seed shall not be aired with a shot
[1:18:43] 1965
[1:18:44] 429 B all right
[1:18:47] he was gone to logos
[1:18:49] the word that went out of God
[1:18:52] he began to brood upon the Earth and
[1:18:54] brought forth marine life now that's us
[1:19:02] that's us
[1:19:03] hey it just says around here low gospel
[1:19:06] watch Genesis 1 26.
[1:19:12] brother Brown said we were little
[1:19:14] creators
[1:19:15] what did he mean by that
[1:19:20] we just haphazardly just think about
[1:19:22] something no there's a Creator living in
[1:19:25] US
[1:19:27] all right
[1:19:28] when the bride realizes who she is and
[1:19:30] what she's doing here we're realizing
[1:19:33] now I think what we're doing here and
[1:19:36] what is already in us not what's coming
[1:19:38] but it's already in us all right
[1:19:41] now
[1:19:43] when the spirit of God the log gospel
[1:19:45] word which God said let there be and
[1:19:47] there went the logos which is the word
[1:19:49] because see brother Dale's going to get
[1:19:51] to to Genesis 1 26 Genesis 1 26 is
[1:19:54] placed in the sixth day but Genesis 1 26
[1:19:56] and 27 was before the foundation of the
[1:19:59] world
[1:20:02] so the logos
[1:20:04] in the form of the logos he could say
[1:20:06] Let There be let there be Let There Be
[1:20:08] Right
[1:20:09] all right
[1:20:11] same way with you and I how in the world
[1:20:13] are we going to how in the world did
[1:20:14] Brother Brown speak squirrels into
[1:20:16] existence had to be a Creator in there
[1:20:18] somewhere
[1:20:20] because human man can't do it
[1:20:22] same way with brother Ram said limbs
[1:20:23] would be restored dead would be raised
[1:20:25] how are you going to do that
[1:20:28] there's got to be Creator already in
[1:20:30] there
[1:20:31] all right now
[1:20:35] where were they Let There Be and there
[1:20:38] went the logos which is the word and the
[1:20:39] word began to cause all this was in the
[1:20:43] logos
[1:20:45] which is the word
[1:20:46] right
[1:20:48] the whole word of God the whole Bible
[1:20:51] for every age
[1:20:54] and as the logos began to breathe upon
[1:20:57] the Earth there came marine life and
[1:20:59] building up the bird life on up to
[1:21:01] animal life and finally there comes
[1:21:03] something in the representation or
[1:21:06] looked like the thing that was brewing
[1:21:08] it
[1:21:12] one more time
[1:21:15] looked like the thing
[1:21:17] that was brewing it
[1:21:20] we were created in His image that means
[1:21:22] the exact likeness okay and we're not a
[1:21:25] separate person
[1:21:26] so that eternal life that we have had to
[1:21:28] be there doing this
[1:21:30] or there's two forms of eternal life
[1:21:35] okay
[1:21:36] it'll sink in one of these days
[1:21:38] and finally there comes something in the
[1:21:41] representation or looked like the thing
[1:21:42] that was brewing it brooding over it God
[1:21:44] a man in the very image of God that man
[1:21:49] fell like the seed has to fall and then
[1:21:51] God began to brood over that after the
[1:21:52] fall he brought up Enoch Elijah Moses
[1:21:55] Prophet after prophet and finally upon
[1:21:58] the Earth came the genuine image of God
[1:22:00] himself
[1:22:01] which was gone the logos made flesh
[1:22:05] all this made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:22:09] now that same logos he's not finished
[1:22:13] now that same logos has a part
[1:22:17] he's got a bride
[1:22:22] give me that
[1:22:24] he's got a bride he didn't stop in
[1:22:26] Christ
[1:22:27] because he said the logos made flesh and
[1:22:29] dwell Among Us he could have stopped
[1:22:30] right there now that same logos has a
[1:22:34] part he has got a bride in the same
[1:22:36] logos this word that cannot be tampered
[1:22:39] with is brooding over the churches today
[1:22:42] trying to bring back the word to its
[1:22:45] full manifestation
[1:22:47] hmm got it
[1:22:50] the denominations have been carriers to
[1:22:53] what they were holding the seed but the
[1:22:55] seed is here all right let's go to
[1:22:58] number eight now number eight is
[1:23:01] who is this Melchizedek 1965. now we're
[1:23:04] going to stop here for just a second
[1:23:10] because we got to kind of breathe a
[1:23:12] minute
[1:23:14] and remember what all we said
[1:23:16] over here
[1:23:18] because in who is this Melchizedek I
[1:23:20] believe brother random lays it out
[1:23:22] how we come here what form and all those
[1:23:26] things
[1:23:27] that that some people must not be able
[1:23:29] to understand
[1:23:32] because they got us here
[1:23:36] because remember if you were born with
[1:23:37] eternal life in you you come word form
[1:23:41] Jesus came word form because why
[1:23:45] he had eternal life in him when he was
[1:23:47] born
[1:23:49] right
[1:23:51] he wasn't born Jesus and then became
[1:23:54] Christ on the River Jordan
[1:23:56] he was born Emmanuel God With Us he was
[1:24:00] born the Christ
[1:24:02] he was born Lord God he was born hello
[1:24:05] he he was all of it
[1:24:07] didn't have to become it he was it
[1:24:11] so he come with this in him
[1:24:13] all right
[1:24:16] but remember now let's read this
[1:24:20] now we see the attribute sons of his
[1:24:22] spirit and that's us we're the
[1:24:23] attributes of God right brother Dale's
[1:24:25] been preaching on the attributes of God
[1:24:26] that's who we are right
[1:24:27] now we see the attribute sons of his
[1:24:30] Spirit have not yet entered into the
[1:24:33] word form body right
[1:24:36] so how can we have eternal life in our
[1:24:37] soul before we were born again
[1:24:40] exactly you can't
[1:24:42] there's no way
[1:24:43] you can't change scripture
[1:24:45] but a theophany this body is subject to
[1:24:49] the word
[1:24:50] and Earnest waiting for the earnest
[1:24:52] change of the body now what he's talking
[1:24:54] about is this is not in word form
[1:24:58] this didn't come word form I told you
[1:24:59] boy sister
[1:25:01] Anna Moringa bless her heart
[1:25:03] she about flipped out one day when I
[1:25:05] told him that this was born anti-word so
[1:25:07] this was Antichrist
[1:25:09] she said no no no no no I said yeah yeah
[1:25:11] tell me this was born according to the
[1:25:13] word
[1:25:14] was it
[1:25:16] so was Santa
[1:25:18] it's Antichrist this is anti-word this
[1:25:21] did not come according to the word of
[1:25:23] God
[1:25:24] the true word did it didn't come like
[1:25:26] this was supposed to come okay so this
[1:25:28] is all anti this is all against God God
[1:25:30] never had sex in his mind
[1:25:34] he didn't have sex in his mind he
[1:25:36] permitted sex
[1:25:38] but he didn't have sex in his mind God's
[1:25:40] not that way
[1:25:41] remember the spoken word
[1:25:44] is the Original Seed the spoken word was
[1:25:47] to bring this forth because that's the
[1:25:49] original way that God wanted not through
[1:25:52] the loins of a man but he permitted it
[1:25:54] because of what because of a choice that
[1:25:56] somebody made
[1:25:58] you were born between Satan and Eve
[1:26:03] doomed lost and on your way to hell
[1:26:05] and if you don't believe it
[1:26:08] just look at yourself if we hang around
[1:26:09] here another five years
[1:26:12] or one year
[1:26:13] I got muscle that hurt that I didn't
[1:26:15] know I had muscles there
[1:26:17] and I'm 53 so
[1:26:21] anyway
[1:26:23] but it's theophany this body is subject
[1:26:25] to the word we are we're subject to the
[1:26:27] word what's inside of us is the word but
[1:26:31] it's this becomes subject to the word
[1:26:33] what I used to do I don't do anymore why
[1:26:36] because I'm subject to the word that's
[1:26:38] in me
[1:26:39] not what I was born with
[1:26:41] what I was born with was a carnal nature
[1:26:46] so were you
[1:26:49] brother Brown said everybody from Adam
[1:26:51] was born the same way
[1:26:53] from Adam was born the same identical
[1:26:56] way there's not one person came any
[1:26:58] different except for Jesus Christ and he
[1:27:00] had to come through that channel
[1:27:02] had to come through the womb right to
[1:27:05] clean it out because that's where it all
[1:27:08] happened in the garden we know it was up
[1:27:10] here first but we know the other part
[1:27:11] was not clean that's why that happened
[1:27:13] see in the fall Satan knew he couldn't
[1:27:16] create this
[1:27:19] Satan couldn't create anything
[1:27:21] but he took this
[1:27:24] the flesh man and perverted that flesh
[1:27:27] man
[1:27:29] perverted his mind
[1:27:31] therefore it came down
[1:27:34] to where then Eve's womb was polluted
[1:27:38] naturally
[1:27:39] by the seed of a beast
[1:27:43] so God couldn't come through something
[1:27:45] unclean anymore but her mind was the
[1:27:47] first thing that was not clean
[1:27:49] God if it was going to be a spoken word
[1:27:51] it wasn't going to have to be from the
[1:27:53] other part you understand what I'm
[1:27:54] saying it was spoken ever how it was
[1:27:57] supposed to come it was supposed to be
[1:27:59] spoken word not a literal sex act all
[1:28:02] right so but when the literal sex act
[1:28:04] came there's no other way then God could
[1:28:06] come the way he wanted to
[1:28:08] right this is all elementary but it's
[1:28:09] part of this
[1:28:10] so he couldn't come so what did uh
[1:28:13] preacher the other day said uh made a
[1:28:15] good comment he said Satan couldn't
[1:28:18] create a son of his own
[1:28:20] so he stopped the Son of God from being
[1:28:23] born because see you know what when God
[1:28:24] was talking about this right here Satan
[1:28:27] was standing right there with him
[1:28:30] he wasn't off on vacation somewhere
[1:28:33] he wasn't out of church he was in church
[1:28:35] when God said this so he knew the
[1:28:38] principles of life
[1:28:40] because of the animals and then of
[1:28:42] course then when God when God put us in
[1:28:44] flesh which was animal flesh
[1:28:47] then he knew we would fall
[1:28:49] because you know what he knew what Satan
[1:28:51] would do Satan would head right toward
[1:28:52] that all right so now look
[1:28:56] at this milk as in now the difference
[1:28:57] between him and you as a son
[1:29:01] he was at the beginning
[1:29:04] the word
[1:29:06] he's talking about Jesus Christ an
[1:29:08] amorphy body
[1:29:10] he came in and lived in that and the
[1:29:12] person of Melchizedek
[1:29:16] then later we never heard no more of
[1:29:18] melchized it because he became Jesus
[1:29:20] Christ
[1:29:23] Melchizedek was the priest
[1:29:25] but he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek
[1:29:29] had the same soul that Jesus had
[1:29:33] but Melchizedek was not born of a woman
[1:29:38] right so he couldn't be our brother
[1:29:41] right
[1:29:42] right he was a high priest but he
[1:29:44] couldn't be our brother Jesus had to be
[1:29:47] born through the womb of a woman to be
[1:29:48] our brother
[1:29:50] very human he was Melchizedek had a
[1:29:53] human body but he was not human and when
[1:29:56] he was never a baby
[1:29:57] all right Melchizedek was full-grown man
[1:30:00] walked up to Abraham he didn't have to
[1:30:02] grow up like Jesus did all right because
[1:30:04] now Jesus is our brother
[1:30:06] because he was a baby
[1:30:08] and he grew up
[1:30:10] Melchizedek was the priest but he became
[1:30:12] Jesus Christ because in that form he
[1:30:14] knowed all things and you have never
[1:30:17] been able now if I was born with eternal
[1:30:19] life
[1:30:20] I'd have to know something
[1:30:23] because now that I'm born again I know
[1:30:25] what I can go back to
[1:30:27] and be able to realize in my even in my
[1:30:30] carnal mind
[1:30:31] even in my carnal mind come on we can
[1:30:35] understand the things of God
[1:30:37] why because God's in us trying to work
[1:30:39] his way back out
[1:30:41] all right now
[1:30:43] because in that form you know all things
[1:30:45] and you have never been able now you
[1:30:46] bypass that
[1:30:49] you bypass look you bypass over here
[1:30:53] you bypass this and you came
[1:30:56] human form
[1:30:59] you bypass coming the way you were
[1:31:01] supposed to come
[1:31:02] that's what he just said right read it
[1:31:04] over there you bypass that
[1:31:08] to know that yet
[1:31:10] you come like Adam
[1:31:12] like me you become from the attribute
[1:31:16] to flesh
[1:31:18] to be tempted now why do we need to be
[1:31:21] tempted if we already got eternal life
[1:31:28] but when this life is finished here if
[1:31:31] this Earthly timeline will be dissolved
[1:31:32] we have one already waiting there's
[1:31:33] where we go that is the word then we can
[1:31:36] look back and see what we done
[1:31:39] now we don't understand it
[1:31:42] we have never become the word
[1:31:45] we've just become the flesh man not the
[1:31:48] word now he's talking about this guy all
[1:31:50] right because remember watch what he
[1:31:52] keeps going but look but and look
[1:31:54] clearly makes it clear you will never be
[1:31:57] the word unless you were a thought at
[1:32:00] the beginning
[1:32:03] by what for knowledge
[1:32:08] got it
[1:32:10] that proves the predestination
[1:32:15] of God see look here predestinated is a
[1:32:18] promise there's going to be a
[1:32:20] predestinated bride
[1:32:22] you choose whether you are part of it or
[1:32:24] not
[1:32:25] right
[1:32:26] but down here you see predestination is
[1:32:28] what Destiny determined
[1:32:31] so predestination brother Brown says
[1:32:33] looks back to what
[1:32:35] for knowledge for knowledge looks to
[1:32:38] Destiny real simple
[1:32:42] I'm sitting over there several years ago
[1:32:44] and brother Harris was preaching on
[1:32:45] something I don't even remember what it
[1:32:46] was
[1:32:47] but
[1:32:48] God showed me predestination
[1:32:50] I'd never seen it before in my life but
[1:32:52] I saw a book come up before me like this
[1:32:54] and the pages just started unfolding and
[1:32:57] I could sit there and it wasn't physical
[1:32:58] words on a paper it was just a knowledge
[1:33:01] that came into my mind about
[1:33:02] predestination
[1:33:04] but even in that when brother Dale
[1:33:06] brought out foreign knowledge that just
[1:33:07] opened up a lot more
[1:33:09] but I knew those he foreknew the Bible
[1:33:11] says those he said who he foreign knew
[1:33:13] he did predestinate
[1:33:16] all right
[1:33:17] now
[1:33:22] that proves the predestination of God
[1:33:24] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:33:26] thought you had to be in the thinking
[1:33:29] first
[1:33:30] but you see in order to stand Temptation
[1:33:32] you had to bypass the theophany right
[1:33:38] right if you bypass a theophany you
[1:33:39] couldn't come here with eternal life
[1:33:41] because eternal life is the theophany of
[1:33:44] God Amen I don't care if it's a spot or
[1:33:47] a speck
[1:33:49] somebody said the other day said well it
[1:33:52] was this little spot in me I said the
[1:33:54] Bible says we need to be without spot or
[1:33:55] blemish
[1:33:56] so it does away with a spot right what
[1:33:58] is the spot I mean good grief
[1:34:02] a spot of God's all of God
[1:34:04] so I just I just got the realization
[1:34:07] that God wasn't nowhere around when I
[1:34:08] was doing the things I was doing except
[1:34:10] he was just waiting on me
[1:34:12] to come to a spot a place
[1:34:19] I don't want to be mean but you know
[1:34:21] what I'm tired of people just taking
[1:34:23] quotes and doing this and taking quotes
[1:34:25] and doing that and doing away with the
[1:34:27] word of God brother Brown did not come
[1:34:29] here to confuse the word of God he came
[1:34:31] here to make the word of God more plain
[1:34:33] and nowhere in the Bible it ever says
[1:34:34] that you were born with eternal life
[1:34:37] the Bible says you're born in sin
[1:34:38] shaping iniquely spouse from your
[1:34:40] mother's womb come forth a liar
[1:34:43] find God in that somewhere then the
[1:34:45] Bible even says your unclean Spirit goes
[1:34:47] out of a man well where was he
[1:34:49] was in you
[1:34:55] where was God he was just waiting
[1:34:57] he already had this he's not nervous he
[1:35:00] already knew what day
[1:35:01] that's why you weren't born on any
[1:35:02] certain day
[1:35:04] you always was
[1:35:07] but I'll read you a quote in a minute
[1:35:08] where brother Brown says eternal life
[1:35:10] started at the altar
[1:35:12] because you had to be a day you come to
[1:35:14] a place to make a choice
[1:35:17] either receive it or not
[1:35:19] all right but you see in order to stand
[1:35:21] Temptation you had to bypass the
[1:35:23] theophany
[1:35:24] you had to come down here in flesh to be
[1:35:26] tempted by sin and then if you stand all
[1:35:29] the father has given me will come to me
[1:35:31] and I'll raise him up at the last day
[1:35:32] see you had to be first what you had to
[1:35:34] be first in the foreknowledge of God
[1:35:37] right
[1:35:38] then when you came flesh to be tempted
[1:35:41] of sin
[1:35:42] then number 70.
[1:35:46] and then you see he come right down the
[1:35:48] regular line from attribute before the
[1:35:50] foundation of the world his name was put
[1:35:52] on a Lamb's Book of Life
[1:35:55] that from that he became the word the
[1:35:57] theophany that could appear disappear
[1:35:58] and then he became flesh and returned
[1:36:00] back again resurrected that same body in
[1:36:02] a glorified condition all right but you
[1:36:05] bypass the theophany and became flesh
[1:36:07] man to be tempted by sin and then if
[1:36:10] this Earth the Tabernacle is off we have
[1:36:11] one already waiting we have not yet the
[1:36:13] bodies right numbers paragraph 71 but
[1:36:16] look
[1:36:19] when this body receives
[1:36:24] receives
[1:36:25] that's in red because it's brother Brown
[1:36:29] should have said but when this body
[1:36:30] realizes
[1:36:32] you always was no I said this body
[1:36:34] receives the spirit of God
[1:36:37] The Immortal Life inside of you it
[1:36:40] throws this body in subjection to God
[1:36:43] hallelujah he is born of God does not
[1:36:46] commit sin he can't he cannot sin
[1:36:52] he never did Sin
[1:36:54] because the seed remains in you and you
[1:36:57] cannot sin
[1:37:01] too simple
[1:37:03] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:37:05] them that are in Christ Jesus they walk
[1:37:07] not after the flesh but after Spirit
[1:37:09] there you are see that throws your body
[1:37:10] subject you don't have to say oh if I
[1:37:13] could just quit drinking if I could just
[1:37:14] just get in Christ and it's all gone
[1:37:17] see see because your body is subject to
[1:37:19] the spirit it's no more subject to the
[1:37:21] things of the world they're dead they're
[1:37:22] dead your sins are buried in baptism and
[1:37:24] you're a new creation in Christ and your
[1:37:26] body becoming subject to the spirit
[1:37:27] tries to live a right kind of life keep
[1:37:30] reading paragraph 72 like you women
[1:37:32] claiming you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:37:34] going out here and wearing shorts and
[1:37:35] things how could you do it how could the
[1:37:37] spirit of God in you ever let you do
[1:37:38] such a thing as that it just can't do it
[1:37:40] certainly it can't he's not a filthy
[1:37:42] spirit
[1:37:43] right he's a Holy Spirit
[1:37:46] and then when you become subject to that
[1:37:48] Spirit it throws your whole being
[1:37:52] subject to that spirit all right and
[1:37:55] that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:37:58] but this seed word
[1:38:02] made manifest or quickened
[1:38:05] Hallelujah made a life and when the
[1:38:08] Bible says don't do this that body
[1:38:10] quickly turns to it you remember when
[1:38:12] you was out in the world and I never did
[1:38:13] this because and I wasn't going to
[1:38:14] bearing anybody else but I never drank
[1:38:16] beer but you remember you just go to the
[1:38:17] beer store and just buy a beer
[1:38:19] did you ever even have a conscience of
[1:38:21] what she's doing most of the time no you
[1:38:23] didn't
[1:38:24] because if you like beer you went and
[1:38:26] bought it
[1:38:27] right
[1:38:29] right
[1:38:30] if you want to go to a dirty picture
[1:38:31] show or if you want to go do whatever
[1:38:33] Corrals and cuss I didn't have to it you
[1:38:36] know it didn't bother me to say bad
[1:38:37] words
[1:38:38] why
[1:38:40] I wasn't so I was subject to the spirit
[1:38:42] that was inside of me not the spirit of
[1:38:43] God
[1:38:47] change
[1:38:50] when God came he changed me
[1:38:52] I can't change myself
[1:38:56] but I had to accept and say God if
[1:38:59] that's you
[1:39:02] that's what I told him I said God if
[1:39:03] that's you take that pain away
[1:39:05] and he did and I was in church that
[1:39:07] night because he knew he didn't know it
[1:39:09] because a lot of a lot of people said
[1:39:10] well things have happened to me and and
[1:39:12] they're still out in the world
[1:39:13] well you know God will honor your faith
[1:39:15] I don't care if you prostitute
[1:39:17] but he honored my faith knowing that I
[1:39:20] would continue on
[1:39:22] come to church that night and give my
[1:39:24] heart to God and start living a life
[1:39:26] it's not been a good life I've lived in
[1:39:28] front of people but it's been better
[1:39:29] than it was
[1:39:30] okay why because I've been changed
[1:39:34] I'm not the person I used to be
[1:39:37] I've been regenerated regime I've heard
[1:39:39] from my theophany you're going to hear
[1:39:41] that in a minute okay
[1:39:45] everybody okay I gotta hurry then when
[1:39:48] you become subject to the spirit it
[1:39:49] throws your whole being subject to that
[1:39:51] spirit and that spirit is nothing in the
[1:39:53] world but this seed word made manifest
[1:39:56] or quickened made alive and when the
[1:39:58] Bible says don't do this that body
[1:40:00] quickly turns to it there is no question
[1:40:02] keep going
[1:40:04] you got it yeah okay what is it it's the
[1:40:07] earnest of the Resurrection this body
[1:40:08] will be raised up again because it's
[1:40:09] already started it was once subject to
[1:40:13] sin and mire and Corruption
[1:40:16] but now it's got the earnest it's turned
[1:40:19] Heavenly now that's the earnest that
[1:40:21] you're going in the Rapture it's the
[1:40:24] earnest all right let's go to number
[1:40:25] nine which is contest who is this
[1:40:26] Melchizedek
[1:40:27] then when a man is Born Again from
[1:40:30] Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in
[1:40:32] Christ
[1:40:34] now there ain't nothing in there that
[1:40:35] says he was born with this Spirit In You
[1:40:39] did it
[1:40:41] when a man is Born Again from heaven
[1:40:44] from Heaven Jesus told Nicodemus you
[1:40:47] must be born from above
[1:40:50] he becomes a spirit babe in Christ and
[1:40:52] then when this robe of flesh is dropped
[1:40:53] there's a natural body theophany about
[1:40:55] it not made with hands neither born of a
[1:40:57] woman that we go to then that body
[1:40:58] returns back and picks up the glorified
[1:41:00] body it's a reason that Jesus went to
[1:41:02] hell when he died preached to the souls
[1:41:03] that were in prison turned back into
[1:41:04] that theophany o marvelous thank God
[1:41:06] Second Corinthians 5 1. Fish Earthly
[1:41:09] Tabernacle be dissolved the certainly
[1:41:11] Tabernacle we have another waiting see
[1:41:12] all right now watch the red see we have
[1:41:15] bypassed that
[1:41:18] what do we bypass we went to hell with
[1:41:21] Jesus but that was in theophany form
[1:41:24] because we bypass the theophany but the
[1:41:27] part of me that's Eternal now was in
[1:41:29] that man that went to hell
[1:41:32] that's what went to hell
[1:41:34] that's why I went and I ain't got to go
[1:41:36] no more he paid the price to bring this
[1:41:39] out
[1:41:40] reveal more of himself not another
[1:41:43] person but more of himself all right
[1:41:46] then we bypass that to come straight
[1:41:48] from God the attribute to be flesh to be
[1:41:51] tempted and tested by sin like Adam did
[1:41:53] but when testing of his word is over
[1:41:55] then we are taken up to this body that
[1:41:57] was prepared for us before the
[1:41:59] foundation of the world it is a word
[1:42:01] there that we skipped
[1:42:03] so he didn't come by the word
[1:42:07] we come by permissive well
[1:42:10] all right
[1:42:11] to come right around down here to be
[1:42:14] tempted and tested if we'd have come
[1:42:16] through that
[1:42:17] there'd be no temptation right in other
[1:42:19] words if we were to come see often if we
[1:42:21] would have come with a theophany eternal
[1:42:23] life that's what I told somebody the
[1:42:24] other day I said the problem with most
[1:42:26] people is there's three things they
[1:42:27] don't understand that we've been well
[1:42:29] taught here they don't know what a soul
[1:42:31] is they don't want to know what eternal
[1:42:33] life is and they don't know what the
[1:42:36] real New Birth is
[1:42:38] and Genesis 1 26 and 27 which may that's
[1:42:41] what's come to you it's a new birth so
[1:42:43] you can they don't understand them three
[1:42:45] they just think eternal life something
[1:42:46] that's just thrown out just well you
[1:42:48] always was eternal God said this and God
[1:42:50] said that you're always this you're
[1:42:51] always that
[1:42:52] no there's a there's a plan that ready
[1:42:55] this there's a plan and the purpose that
[1:42:57] God had right
[1:42:59] he had a plan
[1:43:01] but he didn't plan it because it's the
[1:43:04] way he wanted it we would have never
[1:43:05] come down here
[1:43:07] remember he predestinates
[1:43:10] not by his choice
[1:43:13] it would have been easy for his choices
[1:43:15] to me is just create his own kids that
[1:43:17] are already Eternal or never sick
[1:43:18] sinless No Beginning No End had been
[1:43:20] real easy for God
[1:43:22] but remember in God is attribute of
[1:43:26] healer savior Redeemer there's no way
[1:43:28] that could happen up here he had to
[1:43:29] bring us here and let us Fall by free
[1:43:31] moral ages he had to let us fall
[1:43:35] but what's he doing
[1:43:37] he's also a judge
[1:43:39] he's a just God is that what about he
[1:43:41] has to go by what the word says he's a
[1:43:43] just God and to be a just God he had to
[1:43:45] give everybody the same choice
[1:43:47] now I've heard people preach it that you
[1:43:49] don't have a choice nobody you know
[1:43:51] you're something special and you are
[1:43:53] something special I can look back and
[1:43:54] see that I'm something special right but
[1:43:56] only in God I'm something special
[1:43:59] only in him am I special I'm not special
[1:44:01] because I was born some great lineage or
[1:44:03] or I'm better than this person or that
[1:44:05] person
[1:44:08] you know God is Sovereign he can do what
[1:44:11] he wants to do but he chose not to do
[1:44:13] what he wanted to do
[1:44:16] because he had what desires attributes
[1:44:18] in his heart
[1:44:19] he had desired his DNA makeup was was to
[1:44:23] give salvation to a group of people that
[1:44:25] needed it
[1:44:28] to scale to me that makes him more
[1:44:29] wonderful than just being God that
[1:44:32] created all universe and he's just the
[1:44:35] purest of pure and he is
[1:44:38] but he let us see a side of him that
[1:44:40] others won't ever see
[1:44:43] because the ones that don't see
[1:44:44] salvation will never see a god of
[1:44:46] salvation
[1:44:48] they'll never see a god of redemption
[1:44:50] because they what their free choice is
[1:44:53] they never will accept it right so God
[1:44:56] don't have to put it for he does God
[1:44:58] doesn't do something
[1:45:01] wasted wasted movement
[1:45:04] you know he I was watching Brother Gary
[1:45:06] Cranston and putting up a a
[1:45:09] putting that beam up the other day and
[1:45:12] uh they couldn't get the seams all right
[1:45:14] and I thought man if they take that
[1:45:16] thing down one more time
[1:45:18] they took it down like three or four
[1:45:19] times I thought well God you're not that
[1:45:21] way
[1:45:22] when God put something together you know
[1:45:23] what everything fits perfect
[1:45:25] one time
[1:45:27] but we as humans we have to decide and
[1:45:30] choose but what about a God that just
[1:45:31] there it is right
[1:45:34] right but he doesn't predestinate
[1:45:35] because there it is he prayed that
[1:45:37] predestinates because he foreknew that
[1:45:39] we would want it down here
[1:45:42] and then he could display his wonderful
[1:45:45] attributes not just one attribute
[1:45:47] but all the attributes he could display
[1:45:50] them all right
[1:45:53] if there had been no temptation we'd
[1:45:55] denote all things
[1:45:57] what's he saying we're lost
[1:46:01] that's the reason Jesus note all things
[1:46:03] because he was worried before he was
[1:46:05] flesh
[1:46:07] then we become the word
[1:46:09] here we are formed to the word image to
[1:46:11] be a partaker of the word feed on the
[1:46:13] word by being predestinated since the
[1:46:16] beginning you see that little spark of
[1:46:17] life that you had in you from the
[1:46:19] beginning when you started your journey
[1:46:22] all right
[1:46:24] he's saying when you were born he said
[1:46:26] when you started your journey
[1:46:30] many of you can remember it you joined
[1:46:32] this church and that church
[1:46:34] you know I've heard people with the
[1:46:36] analogy of the eagle story your brother
[1:46:38] Brown gives the eagle Story Watch The
[1:46:40] Eagle story because they said oh I
[1:46:41] always was an eagle that means I always
[1:46:43] was eternal
[1:46:45] well now remember he calls them chickens
[1:46:47] denominational chickens
[1:46:49] right isn't that what he says you're in
[1:46:51] the barnyard of denominational chickens
[1:46:55] well that means you were sitting in a
[1:46:57] denomination
[1:46:58] and something was calling you and you
[1:47:00] were an eagle and you came to this
[1:47:02] message I don't think he was so much as
[1:47:03] saying you always was eternal and then
[1:47:05] you just see that's what they're saying
[1:47:07] you always was eternal and you as an
[1:47:09] eagle always in the barnyard eating and
[1:47:11] then you heard the eagle and you just
[1:47:12] realized that she was eternal right
[1:47:14] right now we're salvation in that
[1:47:17] don't sit there with your mouth open my
[1:47:19] hurting priest if you'll go back brother
[1:47:21] Joel let you listen to one
[1:47:23] okay some of you already listened to it
[1:47:26] I just can't understand I just really
[1:47:28] can't
[1:47:30] but thank God for the truth
[1:47:34] here we are formed to the word image to
[1:47:36] be protected of the word feed on the
[1:47:37] word by being predestinated since the
[1:47:39] beginning you see that little spark of
[1:47:40] life that you had in you from the
[1:47:41] beginning when you started your journey
[1:47:43] many of you can remember remember he's
[1:47:45] talking about people that have come out
[1:47:46] of the churches into the message right
[1:47:50] let's come out of denominations into the
[1:47:52] message that's what he's saying here
[1:47:54] look at paragraph 88
[1:47:56] then
[1:47:58] after
[1:48:00] you recognize the very word of God was
[1:48:02] Eagle food
[1:48:04] then you left the other thing he's
[1:48:07] talking about denominations
[1:48:13] each in that age that Pentecostal age
[1:48:16] got it in that Pentecostal age there was
[1:48:18] a lot of people went through Pentecost
[1:48:19] went through Baptist went through
[1:48:21] methodists went through all these things
[1:48:22] and then now they heard
[1:48:25] the eagle cry yeah to coming into the
[1:48:27] message that's what he's talking about
[1:48:28] after you recognize the very word of God
[1:48:30] was Eagle food then you left the other
[1:48:32] thing you have then been formed into the
[1:48:34] living image of the Living God you heard
[1:48:36] from your theophany
[1:48:39] which is what the word form seed of God
[1:48:42] which is the word of God
[1:48:45] had somebody tell me the other day so
[1:48:46] when my brother Brown wasn't really
[1:48:48] wasn't really when he said that she was
[1:48:50] born with a seat in you it just wasn't
[1:48:52] really the word I said I want a quote
[1:48:53] for that
[1:48:56] brother Brown said it's not the person
[1:48:57] that comes predestinated eternally from
[1:48:59] God
[1:49:01] but the seed
[1:49:02] our word this come predestinate
[1:49:04] eternally from God not you the person
[1:49:09] got it my name not he may not even be
[1:49:12] way Dale up there
[1:49:13] exactly got it so it's not the person
[1:49:16] that comes predestinated eternally
[1:49:19] I just but you watch I mean they'll
[1:49:22] they'll put that cow up in the top of
[1:49:24] the tree sometimes and
[1:49:26] sometimes you have to kind of bring it
[1:49:27] back down right
[1:49:29] right then after you
[1:49:30] Rob his Eagle food then you left the
[1:49:32] other things you have been formed into
[1:49:33] living here as a living God you heard
[1:49:35] from your theophany of this or this is
[1:49:37] all we have one waiting gotta hurry
[1:49:38] number 10.
[1:49:40] Hebrews chapter four
[1:49:42] so it's nothing you could do
[1:49:44] I want you this now this all that we've
[1:49:47] been talking about is about this man
[1:49:48] hair all right we've been kind of back
[1:49:51] and forth but I want you to watch what
[1:49:52] he says here so it's nothing you could
[1:49:54] do you're a sinner to start with you're
[1:49:57] shaped in iniquity you're born in sin
[1:49:59] come to the world speaking lies you were
[1:50:01] born here in this world by sexual desire
[1:50:03] of your father mother and you're just as
[1:50:05] hell-bound as you can be
[1:50:07] I don't care what you do
[1:50:11] you might never lie still keep every
[1:50:14] commandment and everything else and
[1:50:15] you'll go to hell like a Martin to its
[1:50:17] ball to its box
[1:50:19] but the only way that you ever can live
[1:50:22] again
[1:50:25] is to accept the Holy Spirit God's
[1:50:27] eternal life
[1:50:31] what made you what you are
[1:50:34] all right now listen
[1:50:38] because now he's going to go back up
[1:50:40] what made you what you are in the
[1:50:43] beginning when the Holy Ghost brooded
[1:50:44] over the Earth
[1:50:48] a little Easter flower comes up God said
[1:50:50] that looks pretty just keep brooding
[1:50:51] flowers come up grass comes up trees
[1:50:53] comes up birds flew out of the Dust
[1:50:55] animals come up a man come up
[1:50:58] now how was it done by the brooding of
[1:51:01] the Holy Spirit bringing these materials
[1:51:03] together potash calcium making the
[1:51:04] flowers making animal
[1:51:06] making you
[1:51:09] right okay let's just keep reading right
[1:51:11] here
[1:51:12] paragraph 234 just reading straight down
[1:51:16] and now
[1:51:18] you've got a free choice
[1:51:20] God Broods back to you and says hear my
[1:51:24] voice Harden not your heart like in the
[1:51:26] days of provocation here he comes down
[1:51:29] preaches the word
[1:51:33] that's how you hear it
[1:51:35] you have to hear the word because that's
[1:51:37] where it comes from
[1:51:40] you can't come word form and not hear
[1:51:42] the word
[1:51:44] right you can't come to that
[1:51:47] the gospel preached unto them was not
[1:51:49] didn't have faith in it so it didn't do
[1:51:50] them no good they heard it but they
[1:51:52] didn't believe it
[1:51:53] why because they made a choice number
[1:51:54] 11.
[1:51:58] the Messiah 1961 now for instance when a
[1:52:01] man gets saved he's just about like the
[1:52:03] light that comes into him
[1:52:07] can everybody read that again
[1:52:09] the light that comes into him is about
[1:52:11] like this little white button on my
[1:52:13] shirt just for analogy just for I mean
[1:52:16] it's not
[1:52:18] but he's making he's making a point
[1:52:21] that's when God comes into the inner
[1:52:24] part
[1:52:25] of a man
[1:52:28] now if it was already there why do you
[1:52:30] have to come to it
[1:52:31] okay
[1:52:33] but see when brother Brown you you read
[1:52:35] the quotes you always was eternal you
[1:52:37] never was on a certain day you never was
[1:52:39] born a certain day just remember this is
[1:52:40] what he's talking about
[1:52:43] go back to Genesis one man and this is
[1:52:45] what he's talking about
[1:52:47] not after the fall right
[1:52:50] before right here what's in Us by the
[1:52:53] new birth
[1:52:54] the quotes will match
[1:52:57] other than that it's not going to you're
[1:52:58] going to always go to you always was
[1:53:00] eternal you never was born on any
[1:53:01] certain date and all this
[1:53:03] okay
[1:53:04] that's when God comes in the inner part
[1:53:06] of a man the inner part of a man a man
[1:53:07] has made up a system of a Tabernacle in
[1:53:09] the outer Court holy place the holy of
[1:53:11] holy Shekinah Glory on the inside
[1:53:13] then he talks about the five senses but
[1:53:15] we're not going to into that so let's
[1:53:19] read 11 a
[1:53:22] see if you can put 11a up there for me
[1:53:24] there you go I had to slide this one in
[1:53:28] 1961 seed shall possess against the
[1:53:31] enemy
[1:53:33] read the blue you'd have to transfer the
[1:53:36] life of an orange tree into that thorn
[1:53:37] tree and then it would actually Bear
[1:53:39] oranges
[1:53:41] because the life's inside of it is
[1:53:43] orange
[1:53:43] of course you couldn't do that naturally
[1:53:45] it won't cross that way but that's what
[1:53:47] we are
[1:53:50] I thought we'd come here always eternal
[1:53:54] but that's what we are like we are now a
[1:53:57] wheat a grain of wheat and God's Garner
[1:53:59] when we was a kookaburra
[1:54:03] and you say last Brothers 1961 that's
[1:54:06] before the uh that's before the opening
[1:54:08] of the seals I've got about six after
[1:54:09] the seals he says the same thing but I
[1:54:11] ain't got time to read them but listen
[1:54:12] to this and God changed us
[1:54:16] the one after changes if we always was
[1:54:19] and God changed us from a couple bird to
[1:54:22] a grain of wheat it makes the fruit
[1:54:23] different changes your own mind your own
[1:54:25] ideas it's the greatest miracle
[1:54:30] it's the greatest miracle that ever
[1:54:32] happened
[1:54:34] when a man or a woman is Born Again of
[1:54:37] the spirit of God and becomes a new
[1:54:39] creation
[1:54:40] in Christ Jesus
[1:54:42] 11b
[1:54:45] and after this man sinned listen to this
[1:54:47] this is kind of the way that that I see
[1:54:50] it
[1:54:51] let's read in 1950 but now brother Brown
[1:54:53] didn't know as much in 1950s he did in
[1:54:55] 65.
[1:54:59] he was still a prophet
[1:55:01] the word still came to the prophet he
[1:55:03] didn't become a prophet in 1963.
[1:55:06] all right but now look the first man you
[1:55:08] can't see him God second man was a Halo
[1:55:10] now you take a third man and make him
[1:55:11] like a little white cloud coming over we
[1:55:13] can see him the Holy Spirit coming down
[1:55:14] and he's all man
[1:55:16] that's the soul of man
[1:55:18] Eternal then
[1:55:21] yeah right here
[1:55:23] Eternal then
[1:55:25] hmm
[1:55:26] and after this man sinned
[1:55:30] he marred that soul
[1:55:34] Blackness darkness comes into it
[1:55:38] and then God come down and told him he
[1:55:40] always was eternal
[1:55:43] and he never did
[1:55:45] that's not what he said
[1:55:46] and then God came down and lived in man
[1:55:48] suffered with man to redeem man and the
[1:55:52] Holy Spirit comes into man and drives
[1:55:55] that Blackness and sin away from him
[1:55:58] amen
[1:56:01] and brings it back into perfect
[1:56:03] Fellowship a part of God and now we by
[1:56:07] the blood of Christ
[1:56:09] who cleanses us from all sin we become
[1:56:12] sons and daughters
[1:56:13] of God
[1:56:15] 11c
[1:56:18] right here this is 1960 this is the
[1:56:21] adoption series
[1:56:22] the one I was telling you about a minute
[1:56:24] ago you begin your eternal life right
[1:56:27] here at the altar
[1:56:31] here's where you start eternity oh you
[1:56:33] start eternal life right here then you
[1:56:36] are born again
[1:56:38] a son of God
[1:56:39] and then when you die when your death
[1:56:41] strikes you in the body and the Heart
[1:56:43] quits beating the Mortal Wills begin to
[1:56:44] stand still that little shadow that was
[1:56:46] a shadow of the shadow in one second it
[1:56:48] becomes a shadow of a shadow next it
[1:56:50] becomes a shadow unless it becomes a
[1:56:52] trickle and it's secrete next the river
[1:56:53] and it becomes the ocean and after that
[1:56:55] we're standing in the presence of your
[1:56:56] loved ones standing you under clothed in
[1:56:58] the garments of a Celestial body
[1:57:00] that you know one another and love one
[1:57:02] another you turn back to a young man and
[1:57:04] young woman exactly
[1:57:06] because remember
[1:57:07] on this adoption series is when brother
[1:57:10] Brandon went across the curtain of time
[1:57:12] before he before he thought that
[1:57:14] theophany was like a ghost where you
[1:57:15] couldn't shake hands and all these
[1:57:17] things like that but when he went across
[1:57:18] that curtain of time he comes back and
[1:57:20] preaches this adoption series and a
[1:57:23] couple other messages you know he says
[1:57:25] hey I know what it is now they're real
[1:57:27] they can be touched they can be felt and
[1:57:29] all the things like that
[1:57:33] now let's go back to go back to number
[1:57:36] 11 because I didn't finish number 11.
[1:57:40] thank you
[1:57:43] roll it on down
[1:57:46] and that's the way it is that's that it
[1:57:48] that way is through
[1:57:51] self-will whether you will to or not
[1:57:54] that's up to you but that's the only
[1:57:56] Avenue listen to this that's the only
[1:57:59] Avenue that's open to the man that God
[1:58:01] can come into his heart is by self-will
[1:58:04] choice
[1:58:06] choice self-well right
[1:58:10] but that's the only Avenue puts him
[1:58:13] right back like Adam and Eve on free
[1:58:15] moral agency again you can choose right
[1:58:16] or wrong either one you want to now keep
[1:58:20] going to e19 now self-will then God
[1:58:22] comes into the man into the heart which
[1:58:24] is the spirit then the spirit makes the
[1:58:25] soul and then the soul dwells in the
[1:58:26] body now when a man is converted say
[1:58:29] just like that little white button
[1:58:30] starts in his heart now that part is God
[1:58:33] that part's God
[1:58:35] when he's born again with the spirit of
[1:58:37] God God's spirit dwells in him right
[1:58:39] right
[1:58:41] so now
[1:58:42] let's not look at the last one for right
[1:58:44] now but everybody understand what we're
[1:58:46] looking at now when brother Branham
[1:58:47] talks about what he he says you always
[1:58:49] was eternal everybody understand what
[1:58:52] he's talking about the Genesis 1 26 man
[1:58:54] the one that you were supposed to be had
[1:58:56] there not been a fall but there was a
[1:58:57] fall
[1:58:58] there was a fall of Man so God could
[1:59:00] display his attributes of Savior healer
[1:59:02] he had to come down here and get us out
[1:59:04] of the pawn shop
[1:59:07] if we never was in the pawn shop he
[1:59:08] didn't have to go get us out
[1:59:10] we were in the pawn shop like brother
[1:59:12] Dale said we put ourself in there
[1:59:13] because this self-willed just like he
[1:59:15] said well it's Adam and Eve's fault no
[1:59:16] it's not
[1:59:18] well it's Mom and Daddy's fault no it's
[1:59:20] not well it's brother and sister fault
[1:59:21] no it's not right you're going to stand
[1:59:23] at the judgment and there's not going to
[1:59:25] be it's not going to be Guilty By
[1:59:27] Association
[1:59:29] you're gonna have to stand what you did
[1:59:30] on your own
[1:59:31] all right unless you're born again of
[1:59:34] the spirit of God and you know what
[1:59:35] that's already been judged because how
[1:59:37] can you judge something that was always
[1:59:38] Eternal right how can you judge
[1:59:40] something that's sinless how can you
[1:59:43] judge something that has no beginning or
[1:59:44] no end that's not born on a certain day
[1:59:46] and it's the very seed of God it's the
[1:59:48] very DNA of the Almighty
[1:59:51] can't judge that
[1:59:53] that's what comes to you that's why
[1:59:54] brother Brown said the new birth is the
[1:59:56] most important thing in your life
[1:59:58] is to receive that new birth all right
[2:00:00] but now we come down here and we see we
[2:00:04] haven't talked about this much but we
[2:00:06] see an atonement was made then we see
[2:00:07] Redemption and salvation why would you
[2:00:09] need those
[2:00:11] if this came in you at your natural
[2:00:13] birth
[2:00:15] you wouldn't need this
[2:00:17] but that right there is sep that enmity
[2:00:21] is a separation
[2:00:23] but you can only come back to God his
[2:00:26] provided way
[2:00:27] all right he presents you the plan
[2:00:31] and you accepted or rejected it's just
[2:00:34] so simple
[2:00:35] you accepted or rejected and then you
[2:00:38] know what even when you're born again
[2:00:40] you still are on free moral agency
[2:00:44] you still have a self-will whether you
[2:00:46] want to do this or do that or or growing
[2:00:48] with God I I um
[2:00:51] somewhere I was reading
[2:00:53] well it's downstairs where you read a
[2:00:56] quote where brother Brown says
[2:00:58] that face not going to do it alone I
[2:01:00] read it this morning
[2:01:02] wow you think boy face everything
[2:01:03] remember we read it this morning
[2:01:06] faith is not going to do it alone
[2:01:09] you've got to have virtue to add to that
[2:01:11] Faith knowledge Temperance patience
[2:01:13] godliness because you know what that's
[2:01:14] what this is that's the DNA of God that
[2:01:17] is the DNA of God right there
[2:01:19] but you know what
[2:01:22] that
[2:01:25] did not stop the plan of God when we
[2:01:27] came here
[2:01:29] but I want you to see something
[2:01:32] there's a revelation that comes only in
[2:01:35] the end time
[2:01:36] now we know this is
[2:01:38] we know this is the has been a new birth
[2:01:41] since Paul Peter and all those right up
[2:01:43] to Wesley right this was a new birth but
[2:01:46] there was things that was withholden
[2:01:48] that people couldn't see
[2:01:51] they could portray the characteristics
[2:01:53] of God but they really didn't understand
[2:01:54] all right because you know you see
[2:01:56] people in um even songwriters they they
[2:02:00] speak in a in another person sometimes
[2:02:02] when they're writing songs well it's an
[2:02:04] anointing if they're not born again it's
[2:02:05] just an anointing but if they're born
[2:02:07] again man it just it's a spark that
[2:02:09] really connects and that's why when you
[2:02:10] sit here and you listen to the word
[2:02:12] being preached and there's something
[2:02:13] goes off
[2:02:14] there's a little a little spark that
[2:02:16] goes off what's it connecting to your
[2:02:19] word for you're coming into the word
[2:02:21] form
[2:02:22] word upon word word upon word line upon
[2:02:24] line but now what was this Genesis 1 26
[2:02:28] and 27 this is my last quote number 12.
[2:02:32] from that is the rising of the Sun
[2:02:35] because this is something that is unique
[2:02:38] just for the end time
[2:02:40] all right
[2:02:43] Now who is the son of man
[2:02:46] in the beginning was the word
[2:02:51] the word was with God
[2:02:54] and the Word was God
[2:02:58] and the Word was made flesh
[2:03:01] and dwelt Among Us
[2:03:04] right
[2:03:05] and if all the teaching that we have in
[2:03:08] confirmation for the word of God by the
[2:03:10] word of God by signs wonders we see
[2:03:12] today that in the Book of Luke here that
[2:03:14] we just quoted talk about Luke 17 30 and
[2:03:16] all those that we are acquainted with
[2:03:18] that that word again is waived over the
[2:03:21] people
[2:03:22] that the Dead traditions of man is dead
[2:03:24] and the Son of God is alive again with
[2:03:26] the baptism of the Holy Spirit right
[2:03:27] Among Us and is giving us life
[2:03:31] this
[2:03:34] this
[2:03:36] was the spirit man right
[2:03:39] but where was this headed
[2:03:43] in the beginning was the word
[2:03:46] the word was with God the Word was God
[2:03:48] and the Word was made flesh
[2:03:51] remember brother Brown says flesh
[2:03:54] becoming word
[2:03:56] becoming flesh
[2:03:58] that was
[2:04:00] The Mystery of the son of man
[2:04:04] there's your mystery of the son of man
[2:04:06] right there
[2:04:07] that's what the Lord showed me the other
[2:04:09] day and they hadn't seen it before
[2:04:10] that's a mystery of the son of man right
[2:04:12] there
[2:04:13] how that this right here
[2:04:15] can be operational in flesh
[2:04:18] and Jesus was standing on Earth and he
[2:04:19] said the son of man has the power
[2:04:23] is that what he said to what forgive
[2:04:25] sins
[2:04:28] and the Son of God wasn't changed at the
[2:04:31] resurrection
[2:04:32] the son of man was changed at the
[2:04:34] resurrection now this came back and
[2:04:36] picked that body up in May but that's
[2:04:38] that right there was heading toward the
[2:04:39] son of man
[2:04:41] which is a word made this wasn't flesh
[2:04:44] at first this was not flesh got it this
[2:04:47] was not first but it was put in flesh
[2:04:50] the first item fell
[2:04:52] first Adam was the son of God he didn't
[2:04:54] realize everything but the son of man
[2:04:56] when that second Adam come he knew he
[2:04:59] was the son of man he knew he was that
[2:05:01] word
[2:05:02] form
[2:05:03] made flesh now what do you and I got to
[2:05:05] realize
[2:05:07] that we're not a son of Jesus
[2:05:10] who was the son of God
[2:05:12] we're the son of man
[2:05:14] made manifest in another form
[2:05:17] called a bride
[2:05:19] that's us
[2:05:20] we are not just ace on a man
[2:05:24] brother Brown said I'm a son of man
[2:05:25] revealing these son of man but like they
[2:05:28] had said years and years ago
[2:05:30] the bride of Christ has got to be the
[2:05:32] son of man because this right here was
[2:05:33] heading toward God walking around in the
[2:05:37] Garden of Eden in human flesh in a
[2:05:40] plural form male and female
[2:05:43] but only be one
[2:05:45] I believe when we listen I believe when
[2:05:47] we get to the Future home
[2:05:49] when we get to the Future home nobody
[2:05:51] can live in that city except
[2:05:53] these people right here the children of
[2:05:55] God
[2:05:56] and the 144 000 as eunuchs are servants
[2:06:00] to the bride
[2:06:01] now what's going to happen is
[2:06:06] what if
[2:06:10] what if a man outside the city or a
[2:06:11] woman outside the city what if they want
[2:06:13] to talk to God
[2:06:17] they gonna go look for Jesus himself
[2:06:21] are they going to go look for you yeah
[2:06:24] and realize when you walk outside that
[2:06:26] City that your God made manifest
[2:06:29] in another form
[2:06:33] how about that
[2:06:34] exactly I mean that's the word right
[2:06:36] God made manifest in another form called
[2:06:38] a what a bride
[2:06:40] I got it thank you
[2:06:45] at Genesis 1 26 and 27 man culminates
[2:06:48] down here in the son of man
[2:06:50] right here
[2:06:52] because there's no more made after that
[2:06:54] there's no more he was the beginning of
[2:06:56] the creation of God where the
[2:06:58] continuation of that creation let's sing
[2:07:01] a song
[2:07:05] 403 number 403 I've been changed
[2:07:10] I need a change of a book
[2:07:13] thank you I got it right thank you
[2:07:18] I've been newborn
[2:07:21] all my life has been rearranged
[2:07:27] Oh What A Difference it makes when the
[2:07:31] Lord
[2:07:37] listeners now well I've been to the
[2:07:41] water and I've been by uh
[2:07:52] that I once was
[2:07:55] and what redeemed is now my name
[2:07:58] But realize that's where we came from
[2:08:00] and we were redeemed
[2:08:26] free with Brother Ray he's going to have
[2:08:29] some tests done he's going to a
[2:08:31] specialist so we're going to agree he
[2:08:32] said don't even pray he said just
[2:08:34] everybody agree that everything will be
[2:08:35] all right all is well all is well amen I
[2:08:40] like that
[2:08:41] don't have to pray
[2:08:43] just say speak the word
[2:08:59] what the Lord
[2:09:22] 's life
[2:09:25] things
[2:09:32] how can people
[2:09:47] hang on just a minute sister Susan has
[2:09:50] brought up a good point
[2:09:52] my mom's suffering
[2:09:54] I want all the sisters to come up here
[2:09:57] every sister in the church
[2:10:00] now if you're not going to believe don't
[2:10:02] come up here
[2:10:04] but all the sisters because brother
[2:10:05] Branham said
[2:10:07] he said that lady that prayed for that
[2:10:09] woman that the baby was healed she
[2:10:11] entered in because she was a mother
[2:10:14] herself
[2:10:16] so if you're if you're a
[2:10:18] mother it doesn't matter mother or not
[2:10:19] if you're a female come on up here
[2:10:25] sister Susan wants to pray for Mom she's
[2:10:28] downstairs watching
[2:10:30] but it has affected her spirit it's
[2:10:32] affected the way she does things you
[2:10:34] know Mom she likes to get out and do
[2:10:36] stuff
[2:10:37] but all your sisters need to enter in
[2:10:39] you and let me explain a few things here
[2:10:41] you sisters have hip problems that
[2:10:43] aren't us men don't because of your
[2:10:44] child bearing years and things like that
[2:10:45] you know that
[2:10:47] and you have arthritis where we don't
[2:10:48] have arthritis and you have aches and
[2:10:50] pains where we don't have aches and
[2:10:51] pains because you're a different body
[2:10:52] but maybe it's like Susan said maybe we
[2:10:55] can get the sisters here to bind
[2:10:57] together
[2:10:58] Pray For Mama all during the week she's
[2:11:00] going to a specialist for her hips
[2:11:02] pretty quick
[2:11:04] but if you combine together if you have
[2:11:05] a hip problem
[2:11:07] if you have a problem with arthritis if
[2:11:08] you have a problem with your knees
[2:11:11] your sisters just bear in mind this
[2:11:13] whole week and I want you to pray so I
[2:11:15] want you to pray together it's been put
[2:11:16] on her heart and I believe it's true
[2:11:18] you can enter in where we can't
[2:11:21] right okay you can enter into to that
[2:11:23] problem that that you have as females
[2:11:25] that we can because we couldn't pray for
[2:11:28] somebody that had a child and and
[2:11:29] realize that we went through
[2:11:30] childbearing and to me it's foreign
[2:11:33] you understand but now what about a
[2:11:35] sister the dinner end that has some
[2:11:36] problems that had this problem they had
[2:11:37] that problem okay so we're going to bind
[2:11:39] together she wants all you sisters to
[2:11:41] bind together and you pray
[2:11:43] and man we're going to pray too but I
[2:11:45] want you sisters to pray and pray this
[2:11:47] whole week
[2:11:48] that we're going to bind this thing
[2:11:50] that's not going to bother anymore okay
[2:11:52] let's bow our heads tell me the father
[2:11:55] we pray Lord that
[2:11:58] you said in your word that if two or
[2:12:00] three oh
[2:12:01] just agree on any one thing that Lord
[2:12:03] it'll be made manifest
[2:12:06] you've laid Upon Our sister's heart
[2:12:08] which is a wonderful thing Lord that
[2:12:11] we've got sisters around the pulpit here
[2:12:12] Lord that if maybe someone went through
[2:12:14] the same problems and situations that
[2:12:16] our mother is Lord
[2:12:18] and Lord you know in myself that I heard
[2:12:20] every time she walks because of the way
[2:12:22] she has to walk and
[2:12:23] and bend over and and have pain and
[2:12:26] Agony and all the things Lord it hurts
[2:12:29] us too
[2:12:30] father we pray that you would
[2:12:32] someone would touch you father
[2:12:35] that you'd forgive all the sin in our
[2:12:36] life and the things that we do that are
[2:12:38] wrong and that you'll clear all that
[2:12:40] Humanity back
[2:12:42] and that you'll hear our Voice through
[2:12:43] the blood Lord
[2:12:44] because when you took the stripes on
[2:12:46] Calvary you took the pain of arthritis
[2:12:49] you took the pain of suffering away Lord
[2:12:51] we just got to realize that father that
[2:12:55] that atonement of that healing power was
[2:12:57] finished at Calvary
[2:12:58] and Lord now we stand as a church United
[2:13:00] Lord all the sisters together praying
[2:13:03] Lord that you'll bind that thing that's
[2:13:05] that's hurting our mother Lord that you
[2:13:08] would just take that pain away from her
[2:13:09] Lord
[2:13:10] and whatever the doctor needs to do Lord
[2:13:12] we pray that you'll touch his hand and
[2:13:14] deliver whatever needs to be delivered
[2:13:16] father but you're a God that heals all
[2:13:19] of our diseases you're a God that has
[2:13:21] taken care of a lot of things in this
[2:13:23] congregation now Lord I pray that
[2:13:25] actually standing right under our feet
[2:13:27] or sitting right under our feet is the
[2:13:29] one we're praying for
[2:13:30] and we pray Lord that you'd anoint that
[2:13:32] person father
[2:13:33] that you would heal her in the name of
[2:13:35] Jesus Christ
[2:13:36] only one sufficient name there is no
[2:13:39] other name
[2:13:40] except the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:42] where all things will be made new
[2:13:44] father we pray that you just sanctify us
[2:13:46] Lord
[2:13:47] just be with us and bless us as a people
[2:13:49] as a church Lord as we bind together
[2:13:50] even this week Lord
[2:13:52] as our sister Lord has the prayer cloth
[2:13:54] that she's going to give her Lord and
[2:13:55] and for that also Lord that you would
[2:13:57] keep them strong years are coming on
[2:13:59] each one of us Lord
[2:14:01] but we pray Lord that you would
[2:14:02] strengthen Lord as as Joshua said in his
[2:14:05] 80s he said I'm just as strong now as I
[2:14:08] was 40 years ago
[2:14:09] father you're the same God
[2:14:12] you're the same real one you're the same
[2:14:14] person Lord that stood there and said
[2:14:16] that Lord I pray that you just now
[2:14:19] release that Lord that our faith will
[2:14:21] release Lord that
[2:14:23] healing power
[2:14:25] it'll come upon even each one that's
[2:14:27] standing here Lord that you would heal
[2:14:28] all of us father
[2:14:30] that you would Grant this request that
[2:14:31] we have a petition now that we hold
[2:14:34] before you Lord that you all help our
[2:14:36] sister Lord the pastor's wife Lord she's
[2:14:38] part of the pastor
[2:14:41] and we pray that you just lift her up
[2:14:42] father for your honor and Glory
[2:14:44] just bless us now Lord take care of us
[2:14:46] and as we pray in Your Name Lord that
[2:14:48] you would just be with us and buying
[2:14:50] that thing that's going on in her body
[2:14:53] father we ask the things in Jesus name
[2:14:56] amen
[2:14:57] amen just
[2:15:01] just bind that thing I just don't even
[2:15:03] accept it just you know you can take all
[2:15:05] kinds of things you can and it's like
[2:15:07] Daddy said sanctify your medicine and
[2:15:09] and all that but
[2:15:12] God wants us to trust to him amen
[2:15:15] amen if it ever put something on your
[2:15:16] heart you know what you need to do it
[2:15:19] I had one thing happen to me and I'll
[2:15:21] tell this before we and then we'll close
[2:15:22] and if nobody need anything else
[2:15:25] I was in Jamaica one time
[2:15:28] and we watched the video of the tent
[2:15:30] meeting that we had in ginger Hill and
[2:15:32] the Lord really
[2:15:33] uh came down in that meeting and I was
[2:15:37] so weak when I was finished till it was
[2:15:39] uh I was preaching on the vision that
[2:15:42] they were that they were supposed to not
[2:15:43] just see the vision because brother
[2:15:45] Brown had a vision of Jamaica
[2:15:47] and how they were supposed to be the
[2:15:49] vision not just see the vision but be it
[2:15:51] they were a part of that vision and he
[2:15:53] saw the man running up the hill okay
[2:15:56] well sister Brady had just had her
[2:15:58] breast removed because of breast cancer
[2:16:01] and you if you you don't remember I know
[2:16:03] Dad remembers but her arm just swelled
[2:16:05] up this big because she'd have to hold
[2:16:07] it like this so she'd have the whole
[2:16:08] time of the whole weekend was her hand
[2:16:10] was up like this because if you put it
[2:16:11] down here it just swelled up just huge
[2:16:14] and the Lord told me to speak to her and
[2:16:16] I didn't
[2:16:17] and that's bothered me every day of my
[2:16:18] life
[2:16:19] I don't care if she's dead now that
[2:16:21] didn't make any difference
[2:16:22] but that bothered me that that's
[2:16:24] bothered me even till today
[2:16:26] that I didn't because the Lord spoke to
[2:16:28] me I believe in it was a complete aisle
[2:16:31] between me and her that was nothing in
[2:16:33] the way
[2:16:34] for me to walk over there and tell her I
[2:16:35] said sister you don't have to do that
[2:16:37] anymore the Lord heals your arm but I
[2:16:39] didn't do it I didn't obey God you know
[2:16:41] what I've been paying for it ever since
[2:16:45] so don't do that
[2:16:46] there's nothing too dumb in God
[2:16:50] I don't care if a man's got a fingernail
[2:16:52] uh got a hangnail
[2:16:55] pray for the brother if God tells you to
[2:16:57] go over and lay your hands on that
[2:16:58] person come and lay hands on that person
[2:17:00] you're not gonna bother me you shouldn't
[2:17:02] be scared
[2:17:03] to let somebody lay hands on you you
[2:17:05] shouldn't be scared for God to discern
[2:17:06] the spirits in the in the church and and
[2:17:09] see what's going on among the people so
[2:17:11] I thank God for sister Susan doing what
[2:17:14] she did and she said she wanted the
[2:17:16] sisters to come up here see that that
[2:17:17] was a channel
[2:17:18] so through that channel you sisters can
[2:17:20] pray
[2:17:21] that something that us men can't do that
[2:17:23] but now us man we can enter into things
[2:17:25] like prostate trouble and things like
[2:17:27] that we can enter into that
[2:17:29] and we can really pray because that's a
[2:17:31] problem that we have in our physical
[2:17:32] life so that's the way we need to do it
[2:17:34] we need still we still I mean we're
[2:17:36] we're that Genesis 1 26 and never sinned
[2:17:39] and all those things but you still got
[2:17:41] this thing
[2:17:43] because there's one quote I didn't read
[2:17:44] brother Brown said this is going to be
[2:17:46] sticky this is the cuckleberry that's
[2:17:47] going to be sticky for the rest of your
[2:17:49] life until the change of the body so
[2:17:51] this is something we have to be aware of
[2:17:53] we have to be attentive to we don't need
[2:17:56] to destroy this thing because the Bible
[2:17:58] says who destroys the body which
[2:18:00] destroys the soul you got to be careful
[2:18:02] with this thing
[2:18:04] to tell you what to do but you know
[2:18:06] you're sad we all need to pray together
[2:18:08] and the women need to pray together for
[2:18:10] brother for our sister Dale
[2:18:15] he's watching his wife suffer and it is
[2:18:19] taking a toll on him just like it's
[2:18:20] taking a toll on her right yeah
[2:18:23] because one he calls both of them so it
[2:18:26] affects
[2:18:28] I don't think his effects is preaching
[2:18:29] he's doing some pretty good preaching
[2:18:31] but uh but in the natural life it does
[2:18:34] affect it does affect you when you're
[2:18:36] you've lived together so long then all
[2:18:38] of a sudden you can't
[2:18:39] do everything right there together you
[2:18:42] know so let's just let's just bind that
[2:18:44] thing let's just not gonna we're just
[2:18:45] not gonna let it bother us anymore okay
[2:18:47] love the Lord been here too long I hope
[2:18:50] you enjoyed what we what we said that
[2:18:52] that kind of maybe will help you to to
[2:18:54] see the quotes that when brother Brown's
[2:18:56] talking I told the group one time before
[2:18:58] I said brother Branham sometimes is
[2:18:59] talking here that God's already done
[2:19:02] something
