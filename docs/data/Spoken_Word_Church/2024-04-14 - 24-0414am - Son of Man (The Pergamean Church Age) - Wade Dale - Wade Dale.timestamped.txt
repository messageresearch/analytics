[7:57] in this service so thank thank you for
[7:59] all things we ask your blessings in
[8:01] Jesus name
[8:03] amen let's go to Revelations
[8:06] 1:10 Bible says I was in the spirit
[8:09] y'all can see that in the back I hope I
[8:11] was in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[8:12] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[8:14] trumpet saying I am I am Alpha and Omega
[8:17] the first and the last did y'all see
[8:19] that post where the U all the U prior uh
[8:24] Eclipse that went across America it
[8:27] makes those two signs the Alpha sign and
[8:31] the Omega sign in the
[8:33] heaven God's fixing to do something he's
[8:36] bringing this Omega bride to view one
[8:39] more time as brother Brown saw that in
[8:41] the vision one more time he's bringing
[8:42] that Omega bride into view so that the
[8:45] world can
[8:47] see that God's in control and where he
[8:50] is they're all looking for him to come
[8:51] you hear the songs of you know we want
[8:53] you to come Lord we want you to come
[8:55] he's not going to come the way they
[8:56] talking that's right he's hearing his
[8:59] bride he's already here visible on the
[9:01] earth in a in a people but that's hard
[9:03] for them to believe just like it was
[9:05] hard for them to believe Jesus was
[9:07] almighty God Amen but I am Alpha and
[9:09] Omega the first and the last and what
[9:11] thou seest write in a book and send it
[9:13] to the seven churches which are in Asia
[9:15] Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra and
[9:19] andaris in Philadelphia and leosa and I
[9:22] turned to see the
[9:24] voice that spake to
[9:27] me and what do he see he turned he saw
[9:30] seven candlesticks so he saw he he
[9:32] thought he was going to see Jesus
[9:33] standing there he saw a scene all right
[9:36] and he saw someone standing in that
[9:39] scene he knew who Jesus was he'd seen
[9:42] him all of his life you most of his life
[9:45] but he saw him in a form he'd never seen
[9:47] him before he saw him in the form of the
[9:49] son of man clothed with a
[9:51] garment down to the foot and GED about
[9:53] to paps with a golden girdle we know
[9:55] that's in Bride form all right so now
[9:59] Revelations 1:16 and he had in his right
[10:01] hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth
[10:02] one a sharp two edged sword you may be
[10:05] seated the Lord as his Blessing to the
[10:06] reading of his word we're going to get
[10:07] into the pergan church age today but I
[10:10] was thinking
[10:11] yesterday all the all that's being
[10:13] preached about stars and we talk about
[10:15] our messenger and how the star led us to
[10:18] Christ you know you're part of that
[10:21] star you know you're part of that star
[10:24] you're you're not the
[10:26] star there's seven stars seven men
[10:29] Messengers but you're a part of that
[10:31] star we are a part of that and recipient
[10:34] of that seventh Church age messenger his
[10:37] message is now living in the hearts of a
[10:39] group of people called a bride yes all
[10:43] right that's me and you so we ought to
[10:45] praise God for that every day we we we
[10:48] don't have to make oursel odd we already
[10:50] are odd we don't have to make oursel
[10:52] special we already are
[10:54] special God chose us to be in this age
[10:57] he chose us to wind this thing up yes
[11:00] sir so God's going to have a group
[11:02] that's going to wind this thing up cuz
[11:04] remember I didn't know if I told you or
[11:05] not but God Don't Make
[11:07] Mistakes amen he knows what he's doing
[11:10] and he put the right people just like we
[11:12] said before with with um irenius God put
[11:15] irenius in the position he was supposed
[11:17] to be in at the time he was supposed to
[11:19] be in amen for the people that was there
[11:23] to respond to what he had said listen
[11:26] there's no reason to have a messenger
[11:28] without somebody to respond to
[11:30] it because many times The Messengers we
[11:33] saw many times before The Messengers
[11:35] already gone off the scene about the
[11:36] middle of the church age the church age
[11:38] is really just getting going God takes
[11:41] his Messenger off the scene God does
[11:45] takes the messenger off the scene God
[11:47] did that he knows what he's doing if he
[11:49] left that Messenger on that scene so
[11:51] long the people would continue to look
[11:53] to that person look to that person look
[11:54] to that person he wants us to look to
[11:57] Christ and Christ CHR alone so let's
[12:01] read Revelations
[12:02] 2:12 to the angel of the church in
[12:04] pergamus write these things sayith he
[12:06] that ha the sharp sword with two edges I
[12:09] Know Thy works and where thy dwellest
[12:11] now I want you to watch we'll background
[12:14] a little bit with Smyrna but pergamus
[12:16] this age keep in your mind this is the
[12:19] third
[12:20] age all right everybody with me the
[12:22] third age one 23 the third The Three
[12:25] Ages and the first first one second one
[12:28] Paul irenius and Mark
[12:29] coming up those three Ages were the lion
[12:33] age l i o n where the lion of the tribe
[12:36] of Judah they spoke
[12:37] bold but all of a sudden their speaking
[12:40] bold is going to
[12:43] turn and they're going to speak through
[12:45] a pope Satan's going to be so much in
[12:48] there I want you to watch how many times
[12:50] this scripture tells us about Satan all
[12:53] right I Know Thy works and where thou
[12:55] dwellest even where Satan's seed is all
[12:59] right
[12:59] remember as we were talked before that
[13:01] it wasn't in the synagogue that they
[13:03] were the synagogue of Satan all right
[13:06] and thou hold as fast my name this is
[13:09] the last age that the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:12] baptism is
[13:14] prevalent last age from then on till
[13:17] just this day right now we're looking at
[13:19] it was titles of Father Son and Holy
[13:21] Ghost because remember during this time
[13:23] and we'll look at in a minute the Nan
[13:26] Council started 3:25 ad so that's about
[13:29] the time in this church age all right so
[13:32] what man started doing was was eroding
[13:34] the word of God all right said thou
[13:37] holdest fast my name there was a little
[13:39] group that held fast and Hast not denied
[13:42] my faith even in those days where
[13:43] Antipas was my faithful martyr who was
[13:46] slain among you where Satan
[13:51] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[13:53] thee because thou Hast them that hold
[13:56] the doctrine watch the doctrine of balum
[14:01] then you're going to see in just a
[14:02] minute it's the doctrine of the nicians
[14:05] it's become a Doctrine it's not been a
[14:07] saying it's not been a deed it's become
[14:09] a Doctrine in other words when you have
[14:11] a Doctrine it's incarnate brother bram's
[14:14] Doctrine was to restore us back to the
[14:16] faith of the fathers that was his
[14:18] Doctrine and then to bring his message
[14:20] to an end time bride to take us out of
[14:22] here all right so he had that message
[14:24] and he had a Doctrine brother BR said a
[14:27] church without a Doctrine is what not a
[14:29] church
[14:31] okay so he because thou Hast them that
[14:34] hold the doctrine of balam who taught
[14:36] Bao to cast a stumbling block before the
[14:38] children of Israel the Bao or balum of
[14:41] that time we know was
[14:44] Constantine Constantine comes up about
[14:46] the end of this age and brings it into
[14:49] where he brings church and state
[14:50] together all right brother Brown calls
[14:52] it and we look pergamus means to be or
[14:55] perian means to be thoroughly married
[14:59] you would think that we would be the
[15:01] ones that would be thoroughly married we
[15:03] are now they weren't
[15:06] then it wasn't their job to be
[15:09] thoroughly married it's our job to be
[15:11] the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ with
[15:13] everything in order everything the right
[15:15] way no father son Holy Ghost baptism no
[15:19] eternal hell and all those doctrines
[15:21] that came into this doctrine of
[15:23] balum and what did it do it cast a
[15:25] stumbling block before the children of
[15:27] Israel are the bride of that age amen
[15:31] stumbling block didn't kill them it
[15:33] stumbled
[15:35] them to eat things sacrificed un idols
[15:37] and commit fornication so Hast look so
[15:41] hast thou also them that hold the
[15:44] doctrine of the nickolath which things I
[15:47] hate and for all of y'all that's sitting
[15:49] here today God what God
[15:51] hates there's things he hates he hates
[15:55] that he hates the doctrine of balam he
[15:58] hates the doctrine of the nicians so if
[16:00] we're attack anything attached to that
[16:03] God's got to hate
[16:06] it now watch he said repent or else I
[16:10] will come unto thee quickly and will
[16:12] fight against them with a sword of my
[16:14] mouth he's admonishing him if it don't
[16:16] get back to the word he's going to
[16:18] absolutely take the word and pretty much
[16:21] fight the whole time and that's what
[16:23] happened in that middle Church age the
[16:25] fourth Church age which was Darkness all
[16:27] right are the Dark Age
[16:29] he that ha to near let him hear what the
[16:31] spirit saith into the churches now look
[16:33] there is an overcoming group remember
[16:35] whatever they have to overcome we have
[16:37] to overcome that's why these Church ages
[16:39] are so important that's why I really
[16:41] went back and was reading on the life of
[16:43] irenius we see the life of Paul it's in
[16:45] the Bible but irenius thank God he's put
[16:48] somebody in there that would take down
[16:50] the acts of irenius and the acts of
[16:52] Martin and all the different ones so
[16:54] that a prophet in the end time could
[16:56] tell us that's the star right he fits
[16:59] the characteristics of all these others
[17:01] cuz you had polycarp you had anus and if
[17:03] you'll look up the anpus you hardly find
[17:06] anything about him at all brother
[17:08] brandham said in the church a book he
[17:09] couldn't find anything about him at all
[17:11] but he must have been a prophet he was a
[17:13] faithful martyr and he was doing he was
[17:14] in the Bible my faithful
[17:18] servant that's why sometimes we think we
[17:20] can't find oursel in the Bible and we're
[17:22] totally insignificant we don't
[17:25] go you're there you're there you're in
[17:29] Bible you're living the Bible you are
[17:32] the Bible yes
[17:33] sir you got to believe
[17:36] that Amen to him that overcometh will I
[17:38] give to eat of the Hidden Mana Now
[17:41] where's the hidden Mana didn't fall out
[17:44] in the outer Court wasn't in the inner
[17:47] Court H the hidden Mana was in the holy
[17:51] of holies so he's telling this group of
[17:53] people I will have a group of people I
[17:56] will hide myself and feed
[17:59] AB I'll hide them and feed them cuz I'm
[18:02] going to have a church that comes from
[18:04] this evil pergam Church age yes sir
[18:08] right and I will give him a white stone
[18:09] and that white stone a new name for
[18:12] those of y'all that are new there's been
[18:14] a Doctrine about that for years and
[18:16] years and years and years that brother
[18:19] rownan was supposed to come back and
[18:20] give us that name amen well let's just
[18:25] read the Bible can we just read the
[18:27] Bible that's right can can we just read
[18:29] that scripture that
[18:30] says I will give him a white stone and
[18:35] in the stone a new name written which no
[18:38] read that with me no one knoweth saving
[18:43] he that receiveth it amen so it's to you
[18:48] somebody don't have to tell you you'll
[18:51] know that name whatever it is that's
[18:53] right you'll know what it is yes
[18:55] sir God didn't say wait on the prophet
[18:58] he'll tell you what your name
[19:00] is lazy people wait on
[19:05] things I know you already put the
[19:08] scripture in their mind they that wait
[19:09] upon the Lord there's a difference in
[19:11] that waiting is not going and sitting
[19:12] somewhere in the corner that's right
[19:14] that sign that says right up there be
[19:15] still and know that I am
[19:18] God that's exactly right inside here yes
[19:21] but we got work to
[19:24] do remember brother R said God's waiting
[19:26] on us not but us waiting on him that's
[19:29] right we're not waiting on him to carry
[19:31] this thing on he is waiting on us to get
[19:34] off and on get off our rear and get on
[19:38] with the message that's what we're
[19:39] talking about here there's nothing
[19:41] impossible to those that'll try just
[19:45] try which no man knoweth save he that
[19:48] receiveth this receiveth it now remember
[19:50] the characteristics there's an
[19:52] announcement in heaven out of the mind
[19:53] of God goes the logos it's a sealed up
[19:56] message that no one else gets except one
[19:59] messenger that saves the confusion amen
[20:03] but then when that messenger receives
[20:05] that then that becomes the mind of God
[20:08] in an
[20:10] individual and what he says is the
[20:14] truth cuz it come from the mind of God
[20:17] God articulated this whole thing but he
[20:20] had to wait until somebody like Paul got
[20:22] knocked off his high horse on Hell on
[20:25] somebody so he could use him yes
[20:29] so that mystery is then spoken to the
[20:32] star he picks it up and says that ain't
[20:35] nothing but the
[20:37] truth but they have to stand alone
[20:39] remember brother R had to stand alone
[20:41] Paul had to stand alone Paul said I got
[20:43] this from no
[20:45] man wow listen brother R didn't get this
[20:48] from no
[20:50] man he took things that he could read
[20:52] and he put things together Clarence Lin
[20:54] the different ones but the Holy Spirit
[20:56] gave him a message to give to me and you
[20:59] he was the church age Messengers all
[21:02] those other ones they had
[21:04] truth they had truth the Lans and the
[21:07] different ones they had truth but they
[21:09] weren't Messengers to the Church of
[21:13] leosa they didn't have a prophecy behind
[21:17] them as of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 and the
[21:20] different things and I tell you once we
[21:22] move through these Church ages when we
[21:23] get to that last Church age we're going
[21:26] to try to stop just a little bit and
[21:27] we're going to talk about brother
[21:28] brandham and what his message is and how
[21:30] it unfolded and why it was him cuz he's
[21:33] got to meet the characteristics the same
[21:35] as
[21:36] Paul right if he's a star he's got to
[21:39] meet that same
[21:40] characteristic well Mysteries unfolded
[21:42] to the star of the
[21:44] age matching pieces so a trumpet sounds
[21:47] in other words he begins to declare a
[21:49] message then a church age begins and
[21:53] it's a distinct and declared message
[21:55] it's something to me and you
[21:59] like brother briam said he said this is
[22:01] not to the
[22:02] world even on marriage and divorce he
[22:04] brings it down even closer he said this
[22:06] is to my followers
[22:09] only not Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[22:12] he said to my followers only that
[22:14] believe in other words my message this
[22:17] is to you that's real
[22:21] narrow and thank God for
[22:24] grace that a prophet had to give he had
[22:27] to give one in several different ages so
[22:29] God knew we' need it
[22:32] yes but it starts a spiritual war the
[22:35] true word of God versus the false
[22:36] doctrines and we see it now we've seen
[22:39] it before we seen it when brother Brown
[22:41] went off the scene who's going to be
[22:43] this who's going to be that but that
[22:45] messenger's laid away or taken off the
[22:47] Earth but the people accepted or
[22:49] rejected there was a group of people
[22:51] there's a group of people sitting here
[22:52] today that's going to accept the message
[22:54] and go on or reject it and go somewhere
[22:56] else you cannot stay new neutal folks
[22:59] that's why you see people leaving the
[23:00] message that's why you see people
[23:02] leaving church you can't sit in a
[23:05] congregation with the word being
[23:07] preached and God convict you and if you
[23:10] don't take that conviction and bring it
[23:13] before
[23:15] God you will have to
[23:17] leave brother R said Anan and Safara
[23:20] which means oh I pay my tith sometimes
[23:24] brother I I pay it when I can
[23:30] that's the same thing they asked ananas
[23:32] he said oh I've give all I've give
[23:34] everything I
[23:35] got Peter said you
[23:37] lied you didn't lie to me you didn't lie
[23:40] to the church you lied to the Holy Ghost
[23:43] all right don't mean to scare you but we
[23:46] need to pay our
[23:47] tithe it's pretty simple brother Brown
[23:50] said only Christians will pay tithe
[23:52] right I can't believe some people don't
[23:54] know don't know that catch up Revelation
[23:57] but anyway
[23:59] but there's always true and
[24:01] false but you won't be able to sit in
[24:03] this congregation as we continue on and
[24:06] I'll give you a piece of what I want to
[24:07] talk about this afternoon listen we've
[24:10] come to a place to where we've
[24:13] had we've had the former Reign we've had
[24:16] the teaching
[24:18] rain brother Dale brought the teaching
[24:22] rain brought it to us pure and
[24:26] unadulterated all right well God saw to
[24:29] leave him there because he had a work to
[24:32] do all right but now he's not stopping
[24:36] the door didn't shut and listen it's not
[24:38] all a on
[24:39] me you got work to do we got to start
[24:43] living what the man taught yes
[24:48] sir listen
[24:50] folks the days of Plenty is
[24:56] over we had those
[24:58] times as brother Brandon was talking
[25:00] about that Israel enjoyed their
[25:02] Millennium during Solomon's time they
[25:05] enjoyed wealth amen they enjoyed
[25:08] Fortune they enjoyed power being a
[25:11] powerful group of Israel
[25:14] amen but there was a time come when all
[25:17] that went
[25:18] away they went into captivity what you
[25:21] saying brother way well you know the
[25:23] times of us spending a whole lot of
[25:26] money probably over it's going to get
[25:29] worse folks then it gets
[25:30] better it's going to get
[25:34] worse out here Cosmos World Order is
[25:37] going to get worse look at Iran they're
[25:39] throwing missiles at
[25:41] Israel brother Brown said watch Russy
[25:43] but he also said if you want to know
[25:44] what time it is he said you watch Israel
[25:46] Israel the guy stood up this morning I
[25:48] was watching him online from the mad he
[25:50] stood up and he said he looked right at
[25:52] the Cameron and he said Iran don't know
[25:54] what kind of mistake they just
[25:56] made so Israel was ready for it we had
[26:00] already our intelligence forces 3 weeks
[26:02] ago had proclaimed that Iran was going
[26:04] to shoot missiles at them and that guy
[26:06] said look out Iran we're already in your
[26:12] country we're already in your country
[26:15] they wasn't waiting on them to fire
[26:17] Rockets that's what God's people do they
[26:20] act they don't wait on the
[26:23] devil they said we're God's people yes
[26:26] God give us this intelligence
[26:29] no one is going to stand before us on he
[26:31] said we're all ready in your country
[26:33] Iran he said get ready
[26:38] wow a little piece of ground not much
[26:40] bigger than from where brother Ben from
[26:43] Connecticut maybe not even Rhode Island
[26:45] it's not that big that little piece of
[26:47] ground has been fought it has been
[26:49] destroyed 17 times in
[26:51] history up until the modern ages but
[26:54] that guy looked at the camera and he
[26:55] said you know they tried to kill us and
[26:57] I think it was was 30 something uh they
[27:00] tried to annihilate Us in 45 you know
[27:02] with the Holocaust he said they tried in
[27:04] 47 he said they tried in 67 he said they
[27:08] tried in 83 he said we're still
[27:11] Israel amen amen God protect Israel but
[27:16] there'll be a day come though that this
[27:19] country and I'm not prophesying brother
[27:22] R's already told this you watch and see
[27:24] when we turn Israel down when we quit we
[27:28] go to say all right now you need to stop
[27:30] that Iran we'll give you some more stuff
[27:32] that's the day that we'll get our
[27:33] judgment it'll begin that day because
[27:37] the Bible tells us whoever is a friend
[27:39] of Israel is a friend of God whoever is
[27:40] an enemy of Israel is an enemy of God
[27:42] that's right that's why they don't care
[27:44] Iran's 50 times bigger than the than the
[27:47] state of Israel Israel and the mount
[27:48] just about that big Iran's about that
[27:50] big launch them missiles and I think one
[27:53] or two hit the ground out somewhere and
[27:56] didn't even hit anything
[27:58] that Iron Dome killed every all those
[28:00] other missiles that they were see just
[28:03] telling you
[28:06] judgment he coming amen exactly and when
[28:10] we turn God down as a nation and they'll
[28:14] start ripping us up that's right that's
[28:17] when the persecution will come that's
[28:19] why I said the times of Plenty is
[28:21] probably over the times of survival is
[28:25] upon
[28:25] us but we're built for it yes Israel was
[28:29] built for it they made it they went in
[28:31] the promised land a lot of them didn't
[28:35] but the ones that were supposed to
[28:37] did so spiritual death comes on those
[28:39] who reject their
[28:42] messenger so the next days come same
[28:44] thing happens there's an announcement so
[28:46] now we see that the announcement has
[28:48] went to irenius irenius has lived his
[28:52] life he has passed away we'll look at it
[28:55] just a second he's he's moved on passed
[28:56] away he's laid away but the message
[28:59] continued on but that message began
[29:01] began to get pulled
[29:03] apart well God's not that wasn't that
[29:06] wasn't God uh that was uh a created
[29:10] substance from god named Jesus that's
[29:13] what it's coming to in 325 ad they
[29:15] didn't make that happen in 3:25 they
[29:17] waited a little bit later and then they
[29:19] made it happen amen all right so out of
[29:22] the mind of God comes the L go a sealed
[29:24] up message open so the mystery now is
[29:25] getting ready to come to a man named St
[29:30] Martin so remember the age of Pentecost
[29:33] the messenger was the Holy Ghost the
[29:36] alpha age was the Ephesian Church
[29:42] age get this thing to
[29:44] moving so now remember Paul died 64 to
[29:49] 67 the fesan age ended at 170 so now we
[29:51] come into a new age which would be
[29:59] bear with
[30:02] me all right we see there the messenger
[30:06] comes Paul comes irenius comes and now
[30:09] what's going to happen there's another
[30:10] Porter or another messenger getting
[30:12] ready to step in that overlap and his
[30:15] name is St Martin and we'll look and see
[30:18] what St Martin did here in just a second
[30:22] all
[30:26] right and they always coming to lap over
[30:29] now watch also brother rown said look
[30:30] every evil that was in the first church
[30:32] age lapped over into the next one just
[30:34] keeps going on down till it ends up in
[30:36] complete apostasy in this day right here
[30:39] now remember he knew where the seat of
[30:41] Satan was he knew who the synagogue of
[30:43] Satan was he knew the Deeds of the
[30:45] nicians he knew the doctrine of the
[30:46] nicians god knew
[30:48] that but it's all piled up in the end
[30:51] time now it's all come down here where
[30:53] Satan's trying to conquer the leoty he's
[30:55] trying to give a Doctrine to Bam what
[30:57] which made aop uming block for the
[30:59] people there's true Bride come on
[31:03] Church remember remember though remember
[31:07] the vision brother randam had that last
[31:09] bride did
[31:12] stumble
[31:14] hello that last bride got out of Step
[31:18] just a little bit and the prophet had to
[31:21] say remember he woke up saying get back
[31:23] in
[31:24] line well that's us we need to get back
[31:26] in line to fulfill this prophecy amen
[31:31] cuz we are coming into complete apostasy
[31:34] right now Satan will be in his seat he
[31:37] will be in his Tabernacle he will be in
[31:40] his synagogue right about the time we
[31:42] get ready to get out of here he's going
[31:44] to Incarnate a pope which he's never
[31:45] done before he's used them he's anointed
[31:48] them but now he's going to become it
[31:50] everybody with me listen so
[31:53] Hallelujah we might have been like God
[31:56] we might have had these do is over here
[31:58] but there's going to be a church yes sir
[32:00] right now today that is God on the earth
[32:03] that will be Mrs Jesus Christ that will
[32:05] not be that's right fooled that's right
[32:10] by
[32:10] Doctrine contrary to the word of
[32:13] God so the lap over is a grace to the
[32:18] people and we'll look at that more when
[32:20] we get to the last Church age because
[32:21] remember after the last Church age there
[32:23] is no lap over right it abruptly stops
[32:28] Gentile churches done uh brother Tim and
[32:31] I were talking the other day uh we're
[32:33] all everybody's looking for that last
[32:34] one right you know we make that quote
[32:36] we're looking for the last seed we're
[32:37] looking for the last one to come in now
[32:40] let's go to I think the adoption Series
[32:42] where brother Ram said he said when the
[32:44] door of the Gentile Church closes that
[32:46] means the last one comes in he said God
[32:50] will anoint a church then he said in one
[32:56] year God will do more than theologist
[32:58] did in 2000 one year after the doors
[33:02] closed if we believe brother Brown was a
[33:05] prophet the listen what I'm saying is
[33:09] when the last one comes in if we say oh
[33:11] that's that's you know brother Michael
[33:13] and when boom when he gets born again
[33:15] we're just going to disappear that's not
[33:16] going to happen amen we may be here
[33:20] another year but the power of God will
[33:22] be so much in the
[33:23] bride till the world will one see us one
[33:26] time we'll be on display one time to the
[33:29] world you can either be part of it or
[33:31] you can be part of the world that's your
[33:36] choice so the samna church age we know
[33:39] what samna was was what bitter M
[33:45] death comes from the word merish used it
[33:47] in bombing the
[33:49] dead so will what brother Brown says
[33:52] look thus we have a two-fold
[33:54] significance found in the name of the
[33:55] age it was a bitter age filled with
[33:57] death the two Vines within the framework
[33:59] of the church listen Paul knew those
[34:01] Vines were growing already in the first
[34:03] church age Grievous wolves he called him
[34:07] would come among the group listen Satan
[34:09] always wants to be where the word is yes
[34:12] sir right that's why he's not bothering
[34:15] the world he's already got them if
[34:17] they're not born
[34:18] again he's after me and you to try to
[34:21] get us to slip up one little bit yes
[34:25] like brother Bob said quit coming to
[34:26] church and quit doing the things you're
[34:27] supposed to
[34:32] do brother BR said how can I teach them
[34:35] Doctrine if they don't do their
[34:38] ABCs right we wonder why we have
[34:41] problems like I said before a few
[34:43] Sundays ago check yourself up I do
[34:47] believe in
[34:48] checklist I like them cuz it keeps
[34:51] you checked
[34:54] up but are you checking all the boxes
[35:00] come to church every time doors
[35:02] open pay my ti read my
[35:05] Bible pray for the pastor pray for the
[35:08] deacons pray for everybody pray for the
[35:12] sick are we still checking off have we
[35:14] missed one bar have we missed a box
[35:16] somewhere if we have you need to go back
[35:18] to that
[35:20] box I didn't tell you that God did
[35:23] Brother Brown said how can I teach them
[35:25] Doctrine if they don't know their ABCs
[35:28] amen people struggle dad's always said
[35:31] he said I don't need a list to tell me
[35:34] who pays TI and who don't he said I
[35:35] watch and see people that struggle don't
[35:38] pay their
[35:41] TI we love to quote brother Dale till we
[35:43] quote that and it
[35:46] goes we love to quote the Bible until it
[35:51] goes full frontal nothing in the
[35:54] back but that's the truth people it's
[35:57] the truth
[35:58] without god without doing what he said
[36:01] you'll
[36:01] struggle we going to struggle enough if
[36:04] we check all the
[36:06] boxes you going to struggle enough you
[36:08] check them all off but Satan can get in
[36:12] one box he'll get in it and what does he
[36:16] do when he gets in it he don't just sit
[36:19] there he's a
[36:21] Vine he's going to
[36:23] grow and make you worse brother Brown
[36:27] said take the joy right out of you am
[36:36] wow well have to fix that that's
[36:39] annoying so the two Vines within the
[36:41] framework of the church were drifting
[36:42] further apart with an increased
[36:44] bitterness toward the True Vine on part
[36:46] of the false death was not only the seed
[36:48] of the false Vine but even in the True
[36:50] Vine there was a creeping paralysis
[36:53] listen to this a creeping par this is
[36:55] the true vine a creeping paralysis and
[36:59] impotence because they had already
[37:01] drifted from the unadulterated truth of
[37:04] the first few years after Pentecost this
[37:05] is the second age amen now watch and no
[37:08] True Believer is any stronger and
[37:11] spiritually healthy and Alive than his
[37:14] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[37:16] word of God that's what I said before
[37:18] check all the
[37:20] boxes the word of God tells us to do
[37:22] something if we don't do it and we know
[37:25] to do it and don't do it that's why the
[37:27] Bible says in the end time iniquity will
[37:30] abound what's iniquity it's right in
[37:32] front of your face you know not to do
[37:33] that but you run that stop sign
[37:36] anyway
[37:37] okay as seen by multitudes of examples
[37:40] in the Old Testament organization was
[37:42] growing a pace confirming and augmenting
[37:44] the death of the membership for Holy
[37:46] Ghost leadership was deposed and the
[37:48] Word was replaced by Creeds dogmas
[37:50] man-made rituals this is just as we're
[37:52] still in the second Church
[37:53] age all
[37:55] right when Israel went into C ity they
[37:58] had a priesthood a temple in the word
[38:00] when they came out they had rabbis
[38:01] theological order Pharisees synagogue
[38:03] and the town mood and Jesus called them
[38:05] you're of your father the
[38:09] devil that church age started around 170
[38:12] to ad80 312 the messenger was irenius he
[38:17] was born in 130 ad he died in 202 so he
[38:20] died about in the middle of the church
[38:22] age so somebody picked his message up
[38:28] he was a mess he was a student of John
[38:29] the Revelator so was I mean polycarp but
[38:31] he wasn't militant against the nickel
[38:33] system for he himself leaned toward
[38:35] organization he's talking about polycarp
[38:37] but with irenius this was not so he was
[38:39] militant against any form of
[38:41] organization we're going to see Martin
[38:43] the same way listen God knows how to
[38:45] choose a
[38:46] man I don't know if y'all know that or
[38:48] not but God don't make a mistake okay so
[38:52] when he come to Martin Martin just fit
[38:54] the mold because Martin was a soldier
[38:59] right Martin was in the Army for years
[39:02] until he had an
[39:04] experience so he was melant already he
[39:08] was already against things that were
[39:10] evil so he just brought it on and God
[39:12] just anointed that part and just brought
[39:14] it right on in
[39:17] right he had much manifestations we're
[39:19] still talking about irenius
[39:22] now he taught it with unusual Clarity
[39:25] and Conformity to his original precept
[39:26] his church in France was known to have
[39:28] gifts of the Spirit Saints spoke in
[39:30] tongues prophesied raised the dead
[39:32] healed the
[39:33] sick he saw the danger of any kind of
[39:36] organized Brotherhood among the elders
[39:37] pastors Etc he stood solidly for a
[39:39] unified spirit filled gift manifesting
[39:42] local church and God honored him for the
[39:45] power of God manifestation or manifested
[39:48] among the saints so he was clearly the
[39:51] man for the
[39:52] hour brother Brown said look it is
[39:55] altogether unfortunate that the other
[39:56] ages didn't not having in their
[39:58] Messengers such a balance of fruit power
[40:00] and leadership in the Holy Spirit and
[40:02] the
[40:03] word irus said the glory of God is Man
[40:06] Fully Alive he had a real good
[40:08] understanding of one true Living God
[40:11] Jesus the Incarnate Word is a meeting
[40:12] place between God in humanity he wrote
[40:15] the book against heresies which was
[40:17] against the gnostics the gnostics said
[40:18] it was many gods or two gods or three
[40:20] Gods he was a disciple of poar who was a
[40:23] disciple of John the Revelator he set
[40:25] the four gospels as the cannon of
[40:26] scripture there's other things he did in
[40:28] his life but the central point of
[40:30] irenius is theology is the unity and
[40:32] goodness of God he knew there was one
[40:34] true and living God he did not stand for
[40:37] a trinity he did not stand for two gods
[40:39] or one like substance of God as santhus
[40:42] was uh started that um
[40:45] Doctrine amen so in opposition to the
[40:48] gnostics and they just have all kind of
[40:50] gods whatever so irus used the word
[40:52] logos he inherited from Justin Martyr
[40:54] irenius was a student of polycart as we
[40:56] said before
[40:58] and they use that word
[41:01] logos so until the angel of the church
[41:03] in sna WR these things sayth the first
[41:05] in the last which is dead and is alive
[41:09] now that's unusual cuz we're alive and
[41:11] then we die but this man died so that
[41:14] you could live he's talking about Jesus
[41:16] Christ then watch he knows the works of
[41:18] the
[41:20] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[41:22] the flock but does he hold back the
[41:24] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[41:27] no he does
[41:28] not he said I Know Thy works and thy
[41:31] tribulation I know that but I'm not
[41:33] going to stop it because you need it
[41:36] same way with us it's Church tribulation
[41:38] brother Ram look we'll read it in just a
[41:41] minute no he does not what a stumbling
[41:44] block this is to so many people like
[41:46] Israel they wonder if God really loves
[41:48] them how can God be just and loving if
[41:50] he stands by and watches his people
[41:52] suffered you cannot figure out God's
[41:55] love they thought that love meant no s
[41:58] suffering they thought that love meant a
[42:01] baby with parental care but God said his
[42:03] love was elective love the proof of his
[42:07] love is election that no matter what
[42:09] happened his love was what proven truly
[42:13] by the fact that they were chosen under
[42:16] salvation because God chooses you to
[42:18] Salvation through sanctification of the
[42:20] spirit believe in the truth he may
[42:22] commit you to death as he did Paul
[42:27] he may commit you to suffering as he did
[42:31] job this is his
[42:35] prerogative but remember he's Sovereign
[42:38] but it all happens for a
[42:41] purpose God can't take his children and
[42:44] turn them into the
[42:47] devil he takes the devil's kids praise
[42:50] God and turns him into his kids amen
[42:53] that's his election he knows there's
[42:55] going to be a group of people he know
[42:57] knows what we need he knows Lula Church
[43:00] what we need to carry on through the
[43:03] next days weeks months years and ever
[43:05] how long till the Rapture of the church
[43:07] he knows that yes sir and he has a
[43:09] purpose in doing it yes sir if he did
[43:11] not have a purpose he would be the
[43:13] author of frustration and not of Peace
[43:15] his purpose is that after we have
[43:17] suffered a while we would be made
[43:20] perfect established strengthen and
[43:21] settled remember Jesus was the same
[43:23] way why does he stand
[43:26] by here's the reason and if we're
[43:28] children then HS HS of God now we're if
[43:30] we're going to be join HS if so be that
[43:32] we white suffer with him that we may be
[43:35] also glorified together for I reckon
[43:37] that the sufferings of this present time
[43:39] are not worthy to be compared with the
[43:41] glory which shall be revealed in us if
[43:43] we take this little part of life that we
[43:45] live every how many years you've lived
[43:47] and and and every how many years we're
[43:49] going to live until the Rapture comes or
[43:51] we pass it's just a small amount of
[43:55] time a and it is it's an effort I know
[44:00] it's an effort to come to church cuz I
[44:02] do
[44:03] it like sister Junior say she know it's
[44:06] an effort for you sisters to oh you know
[44:09] it'd be just I guess let me just tell
[44:11] you this it would be wonderful to just
[44:13] if my hair if you know if you got all
[44:15] this hair going this way just cut it
[44:18] off that's what we do we got hair
[44:22] standing up we trim it off cuz it's not
[44:25] an example that you sisters are in
[44:29] scripture you're an example of Purity
[44:32] and
[44:34] obedience and obedience to what the
[44:37] Bible
[44:38] says so it's a joy if you get up in the
[44:42] morning and you have to put your long
[44:44] hair up and you're saying words you
[44:46] shouldn't
[44:47] say you need a new
[44:51] birth right
[44:54] amen don't ever complain about your hair
[44:58] if you complain about your hair then you
[44:59] need a new
[45:00] birth right oh I know some say it's
[45:03] falling out and it is all you can't help
[45:05] that but you can help putting the
[45:07] scissors in your
[45:09] hand and you know what that the glory
[45:11] that's going to be revealed in US is
[45:13] that God's going to turn one day and say
[45:15] look they did
[45:18] it they did it I wrote it they did it
[45:22] what's your
[45:24] problem that's where God is a judge but
[45:27] he's a righteous
[45:29] judge unless we suffer with him we
[45:31] cannot reign with him you have to suffer
[45:32] to reain the reason for this is the
[45:34] character simply never is never made
[45:37] without suffering character is of what
[45:39] victory not a gift a man without
[45:43] character can't Reign because power
[45:44] apart from character is what satanic but
[45:48] Power with character is fit to rule and
[45:51] since he wants us to share his throne on
[45:54] the same basis he overcome and sit down
[45:57] on the father's Throne then we have to
[45:59] overcome to sit with
[46:04] him there's a lot of obstacles that you
[46:07] overcome every day to be a
[46:10] Christian even little ones like today
[46:13] you know you got people today and not
[46:15] here but you got people that are just
[46:17] people out in the world to Sunday's a
[46:20] day they go party they'll go to the to
[46:23] the to the lake they'll go to the picnic
[46:26] they'll go to to the Ball Game they'll
[46:28] go and and they'll stay home and they'll
[46:30] make their house look so
[46:32] pretty that's right pretty house that
[46:36] one ain't going to be in
[46:38] heaven
[46:39] right was talking to somebody the other
[46:41] day and can't remember who it was but
[46:44] all these fineries that we
[46:49] have ain't going to be over
[46:52] there all these
[46:54] fineries it's good to keep your house
[46:56] clean it's good for all this stuff but
[46:58] what are you building you building
[47:00] something for here is this more
[47:01] important than what's what
[47:04] there think about that is this more
[47:07] important everything here I got to build
[47:08] this thing
[47:15] here if it consumes us if we like I said
[47:18] before if we have to stay out of church
[47:19] on Sunday to do
[47:23] something that you purposely wait till
[47:25] Sunday to do
[47:28] you're
[47:28] lost you're
[47:31] lost period you're
[47:36] lost this day is a sacred Day to a
[47:38] Christian
[47:40] amen people will wait till Sunday to do
[47:43] something and they'll call you and say
[47:44] well I got to do this on
[47:49] Sunday we got to
[47:52] overcome what do we have to overcome the
[47:54] urge to do something else
[47:57] the urge to go do something
[47:59] else cuz we're sitting in a hot building
[48:01] you're listening to a boring preacher
[48:03] and you you're wanting it to be finish
[48:04] so you can go eat and they're out there
[48:07] having fun they got their Budweiser
[48:09] their Bud Light and out there on the
[48:10] late and they got their cooler Donnie
[48:12] you did it go out there get cooler and
[48:14] get out on the boat he's going like this
[48:16] get out on the boat and just oh God I'm
[48:19] enjoying
[48:21] life a little temporary suffering we go
[48:25] through now is not worthy
[48:27] to be compared to the tremendous Glory
[48:30] look that be will be revealed in US yes
[48:34] cuz he's coming back for us he's not
[48:37] coming back for the world the world will
[48:38] never see him until the day of judgment
[48:41] praise God you and I'll have three and a
[48:43] half years of wedding supper with him
[48:45] eye to eye face to face then we'll have
[48:48] a millennium where we'll walk with him
[48:50] and talk with him and be Eternal and not
[48:53] have to worry about Monday yes sir
[48:59] that's this little temporary suffering
[49:02] if they did it in those ages you and I
[49:05] can do it in this
[49:07] age if you get the urge to do something
[49:09] contrary to the word of God what brother
[49:11] say to
[49:11] do don't go get in your closet and try
[49:14] to do you know look at the and find
[49:16] brother Brand's picture what'd he say he
[49:19] said do the opposite
[49:21] amen if you don't feel like going to
[49:22] church try going to church
[49:24] sometime can I have an amen
[49:27] brother Bob did but the rest of you I
[49:28] don't know some of these
[49:32] mumbles but try come to church try try
[49:34] to overcome what you're what you're
[49:36] going through try to overcome it that's
[49:38] right I'm not throw I'm not saying
[49:41] anything to build you up but she should
[49:43] be
[49:44] home sitting in a
[49:46] chair she has a torn ligament or some
[49:48] kind of muscle in her leg and she's
[49:50] sitting there a few minutes ago and
[49:51] every once in a while they'll Tien up so
[49:52] bad she'll start
[49:54] crying she's sitting here right
[49:58] she's
[49:59] overcome God has to listen God has to do
[50:02] what his word says he has to come to
[50:04] that and honor it
[50:06] somehow that's
[50:10] overcoming oh what Treasures are laid up
[50:12] for those who are willing look willing
[50:14] to enter into his kingdom through much
[50:19] tribulation think it not strange
[50:21] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[50:24] try you now he's reading Bible
[50:27] that is what Peter said is it strange
[50:29] that God wants us to develop Christlike
[50:31] character that comes through suffering
[50:33] no sir is it it's not
[50:35] strange we will have trials we are all
[50:38] tried and chastened his sons not one but
[50:41] goes through that listen this is quote I
[50:42] coming to brother R said the church that
[50:44] is not
[50:45] suffering and is not being tried hasn't
[50:49] got it it isn't of
[50:52] [Music]
[50:55] God brother Bob he was talking about
[50:57] brother Ron Spencer praying at that
[50:59] prayer line do you know he went home
[51:01] Monday and had a heart
[51:03] attack had to take him to the hospital
[51:06] he had 100% blockage in one 90% in
[51:10] another and the
[51:11] Widowmaker the one that takes you out
[51:14] 70%
[51:16] blocked they took him to UVA all his
[51:19] cancer team came there actually they
[51:21] came to the hospital I was talking to um
[51:24] uh brother Nate green stopped by he's
[51:26] pre for brother brother Dutch Scott
[51:29] today but uh the whole team from UVA
[51:33] University of Virginia hospital come
[51:34] down and got him and the people at this
[51:37] little hospital I mean they did all they
[51:39] could do you can only do so
[51:41] much they said we can do the we fix the
[51:44] 100 but we can't touch the 70 or the 30
[51:46] because we you won't make it through
[51:48] it so he calls you be 18 you be 18
[51:51] praise God for them group of people they
[51:54] comes they come down there and pick him
[51:56] up
[51:57] took him an hour to UVA they fixed all
[52:01] three all three of
[52:03] them and he's home now but you're
[52:07] talking about I mean that's what he did
[52:08] that prayer line with and taken listen
[52:10] he takes 30 cancer pills a
[52:15] day a
[52:17] day they're only he said they're only
[52:20] keeping that cancer at bay that's all
[52:24] they're doing but praise God for two
[52:26] years years it hadn't moved one bit it
[52:29] hasn't grown it hasn't and that didn't
[52:31] mciz to his brain and then remember it
[52:33] went in his eyes you remember that now
[52:35] he's healed to
[52:38] that he's a true job that's for sure but
[52:41] yeah when you said that the other day I
[52:42] didn't know it but then uh brother Nate
[52:45] came said you know brother Ron had a
[52:46] heart attack I said no he said had it
[52:48] Monday when he left when he come back
[52:49] from Louisiana Camp so he had that fiery
[52:52] two-hour prayer line with 100% blocked
[52:54] artery
[52:56] 90% blocked artery and a 70% blocked
[53:00] Widowmaker if you don't know what that
[53:01] Widowmaker is that's why it's called a
[53:03] Widowmaker cuz it will make you if you
[53:05] married a
[53:07] widow 70% blocked but thank God he had a
[53:11] team they come and got him took him up
[53:14] to UVA they took care every bit of that
[53:17] so he's a living testimony but but
[53:19] listen through
[53:21] suffering through suffering he has
[53:23] become just a Beacon of Faith through
[53:26] suffering that man takes 30 cancer pills
[53:29] a day sometimes he throws up all the
[53:31] time he throws up before he preaches
[53:35] right and we got problems we can't get
[53:38] to church
[53:43] cuz for whom the Lord loveth he
[53:45] chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom
[53:48] he receiveth but if you be without
[53:50] chastisement where of all are partakers
[53:54] then are you bastards and not Sons
[53:59] get quiet now this special condition in
[54:02] Smyrna must be applied to every age
[54:07] there is no age free from it there's no
[54:09] True Believer free from it this is of
[54:12] god this is the will of God it is
[54:15] needful we need the Lord to teach us the
[54:18] truth that we are to suffer and be
[54:20] Christlike in doing it love suffereth
[54:23] long and is kind
[54:27] right so now let's look at the word look
[54:29] at pergamus that was the the um we got
[54:32] the Ephesian age sman age now we're
[54:36] going into pergamus all right the
[54:38] pergamus means thoroughly married so
[54:40] what's going to happen is whatever we're
[54:42] sayings and deeds in these first two
[54:44] Church ages they're going to become
[54:46] doctrines so that it's preached now
[54:49] freely in
[54:51] churches everybody with me it's preached
[54:53] freely in churches now today it's
[54:55] preached freely churches doctrine of
[54:58] balum amen and the doctrine of nians is
[55:01] being preached all over the world right
[55:03] now but it had its seed or its rep its
[55:07] part of beginning right here in pergamus
[55:10] so let's read Revelations 212 to the
[55:13] angel of the church in pergamus right
[55:15] these things saith he that has sharp
[55:17] sword with two edges what's the what's
[55:19] the sword sword's the word all right has
[55:21] two edges Cut's going in Cut's coming
[55:24] out I Know Thy works and where thou
[55:26] dwellest even where Satan's seed is and
[55:28] thou holdest fast my name and Hast not
[55:30] denied my faith even in those days where
[55:33] in Antipas my faithful martyr who was
[55:35] slain among you where Satan dwelleth he
[55:39] probably got in somebody's business and
[55:41] they killed him and it probably wasn't a
[55:43] drunk it was probably somebody goes to
[55:45] church hello somebody but I have a few
[55:49] things against thee because thou Hast
[55:50] there them that hold the doctrine of
[55:52] balum who taught bailo to cast a
[55:55] stumbling block before the children of
[55:56] Israel to eat things sacrificed into
[55:58] idols and commit fornication so hast
[56:01] thou also them that hold the doctrine of
[56:03] the nicians which thing I hate God can't
[56:06] change his mind amen all right can't
[56:08] change his mind if he hated it in a baby
[56:10] form he hated it in his form yes repent
[56:13] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[56:15] and will fight against them with a sword
[56:17] of my mouth listen when God starts a
[56:20] battle he always
[56:22] wins I don't want him to start a battle
[56:24] against me right
[56:28] he going to win
[56:30] somewhere he that hath an ear let him
[56:32] hear what the spirit says to the
[56:33] churches to him that overcometh will I
[56:35] give to eat of the Hidden mana and we
[56:36] give him a white stone and that stone a
[56:38] new name which no one knoweth save he
[56:41] that receives it so just hang on if you
[56:43] get a new name I'm not going to be able
[56:45] to tell it to you you're going to have
[56:46] to get it for yourself and that what
[56:48] that
[56:49] says not a prophet's got to come back
[56:51] and tell me what my new name
[56:53] is I think he already called us bride he
[56:56] already called us Christian he already
[56:59] called us M Jesus Christ we've had a
[57:02] wedding when you have a wedding you have
[57:04] a name
[57:08] change right here not there right here
[57:12] so this age lasted from 312 to 606 and
[57:15] then remember there was a council of n
[57:16] in 325 ad so it happened kind of right
[57:19] at the beginning of this the messenger
[57:21] was St Martin he lived from 3:15 to 399
[57:24] and all of you remember that when he was
[57:27] a soldier he gave his coat to a beggar
[57:29] he couldn't give it all to him so he cut
[57:31] it and give half of it to a beggar we
[57:33] all know that and then the Lord Jesus
[57:35] came that night and presented himself to
[57:38] St Martin and he had half of the coat on
[57:40] so he knew that Jesus was there and
[57:44] there was symbol but he was showing
[57:46] Martin that hey what you've done to my
[57:49] little ones you've done it unto me well
[57:51] he was
[57:52] converted then he went to see a person
[57:54] that was had some kind of Authority and
[57:57] he went to see him in court well guess
[57:59] what the court wouldn't see
[58:03] him mayor's
[58:07] busy you get that in a minute the
[58:09] mayor's
[58:11] busy right so Mark says I need to see
[58:14] him say he's
[58:17] busy so about that time the mayor got a
[58:21] hot seat God sent a fireball down and
[58:24] set his rear end on fire and the seat he
[58:25] was set setting in and he actually saw
[58:27] Martin after that at least he had a
[58:29] little bit of
[58:30] sense then remember that one time that
[58:32] he was talking to that group that was
[58:35] against him and he says okay if God be
[58:36] for us let's stand right here tie me to
[58:39] a tree that's that's on a slope this
[58:44] way tie me underneath it and he said if
[58:47] God kills me then you know whatever take
[58:49] it it's
[58:50] yours you know what happened they
[58:53] chopped that tree down and when it did
[58:55] and not only turned up the hill it
[58:58] killed the ones that cut the tree down
[59:01] up this way not that way up this way so
[59:04] what a powerful man and he also there's
[59:07] a um uh there's a relic that that I was
[59:10] looking online it's pretty interesting
[59:11] and it's a hatchet because Martin was
[59:14] known to cut down
[59:16] Idols any kind of worship trees Idols
[59:20] altars he had an ax about this big and
[59:22] it had a great big head on the end of it
[59:24] and that was known as St Martin's acts
[59:27] and he would go and tear everything
[59:29] apart how militant is
[59:32] that he said I Know Thy works and where
[59:35] thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is
[59:38] but you hold as fast my name like I said
[59:40] before this is the last Church age that
[59:43] the name of the Lord Jesus will ever be
[59:45] used in baptism in a in a in the form
[59:48] like you
[59:49] understand um accepted practice until
[59:53] now right it'll always always be father
[59:56] son Holy Ghost after that and they'll do
[59:58] away with the name but there's a group
[1:00:00] that holdeth fast my name and hasth not
[1:00:02] denied my faith even in those days were
[1:00:04] antibus my faithful martyr who was slain
[1:00:06] among you where Satan
[1:00:09] dwelleth but I have a few things against
[1:00:12] the because there is them that hold the
[1:00:14] doctrine of balam who taught balock to
[1:00:16] cast a stumbly block before the children
[1:00:17] of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[1:00:20] idols and to commit
[1:00:23] fornication so hast thou also them that
[1:00:26] hold the doctrine of the nians which
[1:00:28] things I hate I wrote myself a note
[1:00:30] there's two things two doctrines God
[1:00:34] hates he hates the BAM doctrine of balum
[1:00:38] and he hates the doctrine of the nicians
[1:00:40] amen he said repent or else I will come
[1:00:43] unto you quickly and will fight against
[1:00:44] you with the sword of my
[1:00:45] mouth listen to brother randman real
[1:00:48] quick we'll be done right
[1:00:49] here thus by the time of this third
[1:00:51] Church age we have two churches bearing
[1:00:53] the same name now look bearing the same
[1:00:56] name but one with a bitter difference
[1:00:58] between them one has departed from the
[1:01:01] truth married idols and has no life in
[1:01:04] her does that sound
[1:01:06] familiar it's happening today they have
[1:01:09] no life if they don't have the name of
[1:01:10] the Lord Jesus amen right she has
[1:01:14] hybridized herself and the signs of
[1:01:17] death not life follow in her wake she is
[1:01:21] powerful many members favored by the
[1:01:24] world the other is a little persecuted
[1:01:26] group but she follows the word and signs
[1:01:30] follow her the sick are healed the dead
[1:01:32] are raised she's alive with life in the
[1:01:34] word of God she loves not her life but
[1:01:37] holds to his name and his faith even
[1:01:39] unto death and so the terrible
[1:01:42] persecution of official Rome fell upon
[1:01:44] the True Believers until Constantine now
[1:01:47] watch watch how watch how slick the
[1:01:50] devil is just for a second before we
[1:01:51] close let how slick this guy is now what
[1:01:55] does con do Constantine comes up and
[1:01:58] brings church and state together he sees
[1:02:00] all this property he's got all this
[1:02:02] money he puts them both together and
[1:02:04] makes synagogues and all these different
[1:02:06] things he sends people out on
[1:02:08] crusades right seems to be the nice guy
[1:02:13] that brought all that
[1:02:15] together that was the
[1:02:18] devil
[1:02:19] amen but watch how the devil Works Rome
[1:02:24] was persecuting the believer
[1:02:27] am everybody with me now watch this was
[1:02:29] so astounding Rome say Rome was the
[1:02:32] devil the devil is persecuting True
[1:02:36] Believers until Constantine Constantine
[1:02:38] sees
[1:02:41] that he arose and granted freedom of
[1:02:43] religious worship seems like a nice
[1:02:47] guy but there seems to be two reasons
[1:02:49] why this Freedom was granted in the
[1:02:52] first place various good Emperors had
[1:02:54] not allowed persecution but as they
[1:02:55] passed on they were followed by those
[1:02:57] who killed Christians it was so
[1:03:00] senseless that it finally came to a
[1:03:02] public head that the Christians ought to
[1:03:03] be left
[1:03:05] alone that's the devil saying
[1:03:08] that the second and best noted reason is
[1:03:11] that Constantine had a very difficult
[1:03:12] battle ahead of him we know the story of
[1:03:14] that and taking over the control of the
[1:03:16] Empire One Night in a dream he saw a
[1:03:18] white cross it's why they called him
[1:03:19] crossbags he thought he was doing it for
[1:03:22] God he was putting it together for the
[1:03:24] devil
[1:03:26] brother rown called that the Dark Ages
[1:03:28] when church and state married Ahab and
[1:03:31] Jezebel married was in the Old Testament
[1:03:33] and this was where Jezebel and Ahab
[1:03:37] married in our time but I want you to
[1:03:39] watch what he says one night in a dream
[1:03:42] he saw white crosses appear before him
[1:03:43] he felt that this was an omen unto him
[1:03:46] that if the Christians prayed for a
[1:03:47] victory for him he would win the battle
[1:03:49] he promised freedom for them in the
[1:03:51] event he was Victorious he was
[1:03:53] Victorious and the freedom of worship
[1:03:55] was granted in the Edict of NES 312 ad
[1:04:00] but
[1:04:02] but this freedom from persecution to
[1:04:04] death was not as
[1:04:06] monogamous as it first
[1:04:09] appeared Constantine was now the
[1:04:12] patron as a patron his interest was
[1:04:15] somewhat more than that of an observer
[1:04:17] for he decided that the church needed
[1:04:18] his
[1:04:19] help God don't need
[1:04:22] help he had seen them disagreeing over
[1:04:25] various matters one of them which
[1:04:27] involved Aras Bishop of Alexander who
[1:04:29] taught his adherence that Jesus was not
[1:04:31] truly God now watch but a Lesser God
[1:04:34] having been created by God kind of the
[1:04:37] way it is today the western church held
[1:04:39] the opposite view believing that Jesus
[1:04:41] was the very essence of God as they said
[1:04:43] coequal with the father with such
[1:04:45] matters along with the intrusion of
[1:04:47] pagan ceremony into worship the end the
[1:04:50] emperor called for the Nan Council in
[1:04:52] 3:25 ad with the thought that he would
[1:04:55] bring all the groups together where they
[1:04:57] could iron out their differences and
[1:04:59] come to a common understanding let's
[1:05:01] just all get
[1:05:04] together and all and all be one isn't it
[1:05:08] peculiar that though they started with
[1:05:11] Constantine it didn't die but it's very
[1:05:14] much alive
[1:05:17] today that was the
[1:05:19] seed for the World Council of churches
[1:05:22] which is going to head up and that's the
[1:05:23] one that's going to persecute the bride
[1:05:25] amen the World Council of churches
[1:05:26] started back there with Constantine
[1:05:28] bringing church and state together
[1:05:29] making them powerful giving them land
[1:05:32] giving them authority to do things
[1:05:33] letting them worship the way they want
[1:05:35] to until Constantine come to a place to
[1:05:39] where remember he
[1:05:43] said in other words my Christianity is
[1:05:46] the one you got to deal you got to you
[1:05:47] got to come to if you don't come to my
[1:05:48] Christianity we're going to kill you so
[1:05:51] you see now we're heading into the Dark
[1:05:52] Ages we 68 million Christians
[1:05:56] that's the next age we're getting into
[1:05:58] 68 million Christian million 68 million
[1:06:03] Christians that's about the population
[1:06:05] of of California and a couple other
[1:06:08] states 68 million people were killed
[1:06:11] because they said they were Christians
[1:06:12] but not the kind of Christian
[1:06:14] Constantine wanted them to be wow and
[1:06:17] where he failed to truly achieve it it
[1:06:20] will be achieved in this day through the
[1:06:23] ecumenical move
[1:06:26] amen folks we're at the end
[1:06:31] time right there that thing that
[1:06:34] happened in 325 ad read about it really
[1:06:38] what happened in 325 ad they didn't come
[1:06:41] to any conclusion like Constantine
[1:06:42] wanted them
[1:06:43] to that's why he started persecuting
[1:06:45] them then in 606 ad is when they really
[1:06:48] come up with all this and said all right
[1:06:50] this is law you're baptizing this way
[1:06:51] this is what it's going to be we have
[1:06:53] Apostles Creed we have all this this 'll
[1:06:55] be a pope now and you'll listen to this
[1:06:57] Pope that's how it all got started well
[1:06:59] guess what that's what's going to happen
[1:07:00] right now we got religious freedom stand
[1:07:03] let's stand our feet we got religious
[1:07:05] freedom when we came here in America
[1:07:08] right we got religious freedom but what
[1:07:11] was it though it's the birthplace of
[1:07:14] where the World Council of churches is
[1:07:16] going to head
[1:07:17] up right here in this
[1:07:20] nation but it started out true but
[1:07:24] somewhere it turned
[1:07:27] false listen let's don't let our life do
[1:07:30] that let's don't let our life start out
[1:07:33] true and and we started out because how
[1:07:35] many many times we see that that God
[1:07:39] says I have somewhat against you because
[1:07:42] you've left
[1:07:44] something I have somewhat against you I
[1:07:47] love you you take my name some of you
[1:07:49] still hold my name some of you still do
[1:07:50] the things that I want you to do but
[1:07:52] there's a group of
[1:07:54] you that I have somewhat
[1:07:58] against we pray that we're not in that
[1:08:02] group checking up
[1:08:04] time for all of you yes sir for all of
[1:08:07] us we're heading into a new
[1:08:09] era okay we're heading into not a new
[1:08:13] way but we're heading into something
[1:08:15] that we might have not have thought 5
[1:08:17] years ago we' ever come this
[1:08:19] way everybody with me this is the fact
[1:08:23] we're standing here alive
[1:08:25] and the way we deal with it is going to
[1:08:28] determine our
[1:08:30] future everybody with me all right and
[1:08:34] to to you sisters I again I apologize
[1:08:38] but I'd like to just speak to the men
[1:08:40] first and um you're very important
[1:08:43] you're extremely important you're the to
[1:08:46] you're the you're the backbone you're
[1:08:47] the remember you're the Fifth
[1:08:51] Gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John and
[1:08:53] the mom that's what brother rown said
[1:08:55] all right
[1:08:56] that's what you are and we appreciate
[1:08:58] you and we love you but there are
[1:08:59] certain things that we need to discuss
[1:09:02] that
[1:09:03] that sometime emotion gets involved and
[1:09:06] sometimes you know a lot of things get
[1:09:08] involved that that sisters can't handle
[1:09:10] now I'm not I'm going to tell you what
[1:09:11] brother rown said that y'all are more
[1:09:13] conf thousand more times confused than
[1:09:15] we are or can be right boy you don't get
[1:09:19] many amens out of that but it's in print
[1:09:22] it's in print he said it all right I'm
[1:09:25] listen why you getting mad at
[1:09:27] me I'm just telling you what brother
[1:09:29] random said thousand times more confused
[1:09:33] all right well let's just keep it that
[1:09:34] all the confusion out and I know some of
[1:09:36] you are just absolutely in the word of
[1:09:40] God
[1:09:41] lighthouses
[1:09:43] Stellar you get behind your husband
[1:09:45] though cuz
[1:09:47] remember remember this one thing we
[1:09:49] still believe brother R was a prophet
[1:09:51] right brother Ram said you sisters will
[1:09:54] never give an
[1:09:56] account of the
[1:09:58] brothers but you Brothers will give an
[1:10:01] account for your
[1:10:05] wife can I say that one more time since
[1:10:07] y'all are silent I'm G to say it again
[1:10:10] so you hear what I said brother Brown
[1:10:12] said you sisters you're free from that
[1:10:14] you're free from from being deacons and
[1:10:16] having to make raw decisions sometimes
[1:10:19] that that maybe are are are against your
[1:10:23] emotion
[1:10:25] right um against your
[1:10:29] love
[1:10:32] right cuz you can be deceived more than
[1:10:34] we can and I'm sorry that's what that's
[1:10:36] just the way the makeup is that's why
[1:10:37] brother BR you know that's why God said
[1:10:39] there'll be no pastors that are women
[1:10:41] there'll be no pastors that are
[1:10:43] deacons is everybody with me on this I
[1:10:46] and you sisters should glory in that all
[1:10:48] you got to do is is take care of your
[1:10:51] husband sure you got a job sure some of
[1:10:53] you don't have husbands but your husband
[1:10:55] is Christ please take care of him he's
[1:10:58] the one that marries you he's the one
[1:11:00] that's he's more important to me than
[1:11:02] June is sorry that's right you got to
[1:11:05] put it that way but he gave you a good
[1:11:09] wife then cherish her listen to
[1:11:12] her but there has to be one controlling
[1:11:15] factor and that has to be the men and
[1:11:18] like I said before I don't apologize for
[1:11:20] saying it I apologize if I hurt your
[1:11:22] feelings and it's like well you're
[1:11:23] excluding us you ought to be happy that
[1:11:27] you don't have to stand up here and
[1:11:30] listen to phone calls three or four
[1:11:31] times a day and and and different things
[1:11:34] and have to handle stuff I I I want to
[1:11:37] tell you something real
[1:11:39] quick I watched my dad wear yourself out
[1:11:43] for you
[1:11:46] guys okay everybody with
[1:11:49] me in the 90s before I came to the Lord
[1:11:52] remember I think I told you this one
[1:11:54] time before I wasn't serving the lord in
[1:11:56] the early part of the 90s so Dad would
[1:11:58] be sitting here and you know dealing
[1:12:01] with y'all I mean some of you weren't
[1:12:03] here but he was dealing with situations
[1:12:05] in the church and and I thought
[1:12:09] man he's a rockage ofro this
[1:12:12] guy he come to my house and he'd sit
[1:12:15] down and he'd have a look on his face
[1:12:17] like I ain't never seen
[1:12:20] before and he say hey would you just put
[1:12:22] on a hunting
[1:12:23] video would you put some on so we can
[1:12:26] watch and right I knew then he was
[1:12:29] having trying to deal he took listen he
[1:12:31] took something home with him that he was
[1:12:33] dealing with in his mind as a human
[1:12:35] being trying to trying to uh stand
[1:12:38] between God and the
[1:12:39] people and do the right thing and not do
[1:12:42] it
[1:12:43] partial not do it leaning toward one
[1:12:47] side but he say just just put on hunting
[1:12:50] video and let's watch a hunting video he
[1:12:51] won't talk about nothing we'd eat you
[1:12:53] know and fellowship a little bit his
[1:12:55] family but he's just like you know I I
[1:12:57] just I want to get away from this but
[1:13:00] that's the burden that a pastor has and
[1:13:02] I and I appreciate your um your vote of
[1:13:06] confidence and like I said before the
[1:13:08] ones of you that didn't vote for me I
[1:13:09] give me some time hadn't done this
[1:13:12] before just love me if I quit preaching
[1:13:16] the word of God you have a right to
[1:13:19] leave that's right rest of the time kind
[1:13:21] of hang on okay I'm going to try to
[1:13:23] preach the word of God and let everybody
[1:13:24] kind of just you you know I'm not
[1:13:26] brother
[1:13:27] Dale um it's a different Administration
[1:13:30] it it's going to
[1:13:31] be and it is we hate change we're humans
[1:13:35] but we got to go as I said in this
[1:13:40] look the way to get started is to quit
[1:13:43] talking and begin doing right and I
[1:13:47] appreciate all your sisters in this
[1:13:49] church you work your fingers to the Bone
[1:13:52] but get behind your husband don't be
[1:13:55] enemy he's got enough don't be be his be

[1:14:21] me away from this place then we're going
[1:14:22] to try to preach the word of God the
[1:14:24] best we can we're going to try to make
[1:14:25] decisions that helps each and every one
[1:14:26] of you including the sisters but today
[1:14:30] this afternoon we're just going to meet
[1:14:31] with the brothers and just look at some
[1:14:32] things because they are the heads of
[1:14:34] state they do uh run the part of the
[1:14:38] church we're an organism not an
[1:14:40] organization and an organism has many
[1:14:43] things that we need to work with We
[1:14:44] Appreciate You sisters that teach Sunday
[1:14:46] school but according to brother brandham
[1:14:48] Sunday school teachers up until about a
[1:14:51] teenage can be a woman but after that a
[1:14:54] man should be the one and that's what we
[1:14:56] have that here and that's fine stay in
[1:14:57] your place I read a quote yesterday
[1:14:59] brother R said deacons don't try to be
[1:15:01] trustees pastors don't try to be deacons
[1:15:04] trustees don't try to be board of
[1:15:05] directors sit in your position so
[1:15:08] sisters you got a position and it's very
[1:15:11] honorable no dishonor at
[1:15:14] all because God said if he called the
[1:15:18] man through brother brandom if you
[1:15:20] called the man he called the wife
[1:15:23] too okay so as much as he called brother
