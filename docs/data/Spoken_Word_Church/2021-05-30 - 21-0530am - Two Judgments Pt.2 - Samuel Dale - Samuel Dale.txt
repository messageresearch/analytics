========================================

[singing] [music] [music] [singing] as we [singing] [music] [singing] oh [music] [music and singing] holy [music] [music] and amen and amen just take a look around you'll find him amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to uh revelations 20 and then we'll go to romans 14. good to have our visitors with us and we always say here when you come one time you're a visitor you come two times you're just part of us so we don't have anything to join we don't have anything to build up or make up we're just part of the body of christ and we just say to you welcome and glad to see you in fact good to see you brother uh direct there but getting his back straightened out and everything it was good to see that good to have brother uh daniel and and uh his wife with us and the family and all glad to have them with us and we just pray that the lord would bless uh wade's over preaching for brother pageant today and then this afternoon brother bob will be taking the evening service uh in wade's place so we we pray that the lord would bless all right uh then this coming wednesday now will be brother uh daniel uh martinez will be ministering the word of the lord unto us uh for the wednesday night service so uh let's see wouldn't i'd write myself a note because i'm 81 you know i have to i've got [snorts] an excuse me and reagan we can do anything we want to you know because we got excuses you know but uh you know it's good to see everybody if you'd like to just follow along the reading revelations 20 and then we'll go to romans 14 and try to pick up a thought and just continue from where we were uh this past sunday pray the lord would bless any other things any announcements we always miss them there will be you've terrance's announced these others but we're going to have and we're going to just casually announce it and you know but we want to start announcing you know pretty quick pretty heavy on the basis of having our 50th anniversary of the church because this coming fourth of july will be 50 years that we have been in service in this church and i pray and hope that it doesn't end up the way that it did we're going to have the services at another place because if you remember what happened here when we had the first service 50 years ago there was five vehicles parked out front and a man came down the road uh running real fast and he he just took a little part of each one and kind of demolished a couple of them and all so we pray and hope that that won't be so we're going to have it somewhere else not for that reason but it'll be and it'll be announced later and on where uh you would understand okay father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for everything and we pray that you would just guide each one of us in your love let your light shine into our hearts and lives that we may see you and to walk in the light of your grace father just be with each one member way there as he's ministering for brother pageant and lord and just bless each one and just let your light come forth and show us lord the things to say to your people we love you and we thank you we just praise your great name in the name of the lord jesus christ is what we pray amen if you like to follow in the reading of revelations 20. we'll start verse 7. now the reason i'm reading this i want you to realize when this will take place the time frames is what i'm wanting you to get because the time frames will help us to understand what is taking place see all right see you say well this year take place here well that might have taken place over in the old testament there's a time frame for different things and that's what i want you to to follow is the time frame and then you'll know and you won't be wondering well when does this happen because you'll have the lineup that says well somebody said it's over here so but it can't be there because there's a time frame laid there that shows it to what it will be so listen to the time frame now and when the thousand years are expired okay now this is after the millennium this is coming forth a thousand years of millennial reign all right satan shall be loose out of his prison he should go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea and they went up on the breath of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about the blood and the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone or in brims and where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever and i saw a white throne a great white throne and him that sat on the throne whose face the earth and this heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books books now plural so you have the book of life will be present at this judgment but you also have books which books is actually the books of the sinners which is a record of life in in mankind there will be books there that will be a record of what where what is doing of the people upon the earth all right and books were opened and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell was cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we'll pick up our scripture as we were using it last week and so you understand what i'm what i'm doing in other words that way to me i can understand the bible if i can find a time frame a position a situation and i know then that way i know that i'm lined up in the scriptures and see then we read where when the thousand years has expired so this is after the thousand year so we know the thousand years and the millennial reign which is born again believers we believe in the millennial reign that is to come one day of a thousand years upon earth to to to god to rule and reign upon this earth and we are to be there with him in that ruling and reigning in in times and even the bible speaks that that we're to join the fact that even that we will be able to one day judge angels the bible speaks of the people of god or someone that will judge angels or even judge the people and things like that and there is those judgments set there all right but now this judgment here is the same judgment of daniel 9 daniel 7 9 through 10 which brings up and and shows the judgment or the white throne judgment as we are to basically use it in our terminology in christianity that there is coming a time when there will be a white throne judgment there will be a judgment set for mankind and and that judgment will be there for for uh to determine and at the white throne judgment it will be the determining of whether or not you can enter into eternal life because see the book is there which is a lamb's book of life or the book of life is just called here all right that book will be there and if your name is not written as we read in that book then you're going to be cast out all right so there's going to be a book there there's going to be books which is the books of the sinners or in other words the life of mankind books records not necessarily having to have uh you know i hope you understand my point it's not necessarily that there has to be these books are and they turn to play okay we see here so and so once and we turn another place on uh remember we're in a computer age when you can go in a thousand people could appear across a screen as to be judged and different things like that but just to think about uh the things that will take place all right but what we were talking about last sunday and getting to that point that we see this this white throne judgment all right and that white throne judgment as we've read here and shown in it it will be determining whether or not some people will be given eternal life because there is an opportunity after this world of receiving eternal life but it's not in the basis of not throwing off on anybody not in the basis of catholicism of how good you are for this or that or the other or what you've done or didn't do that way it's a judgment that will be set one day because there will be a white throne and god will sit on that throne according to the book of daniel and there'll be people sitting on that throne with him all right now that's what's so marvelous is to find out that those people sitting on that throne with him are special people that are not having to be judged at a white throne because their judgment is already set here if you receive eternal life here you do not have to go to the white throne judgment that is a marvelous situation or a point of interest and should be to each one of us a joy to think about it that hey if we get born again saved born again whatever you calling it uh your new birth your your things whatever you're calling your salvation when we get to that to where that you receive that eternal life here you don't have to go to a white throne you will actually be sitting on the throne with him to judge others even to judge angels the bible says see because there's going to have to be a judgment set of those things but what about a group of people that will be able to uh we bypass death we bypass all of the things and sit on the white throne or sit on the throne with him not standing before him there's thousands thousands standing before him as we caught we read there and read the book of daniel and all and you'll see a great uh multitude of people because all the dead will have to be raised up see and brought to that white throne judgment and when it does then thousands of thousands will stand before him to be judged but also thousands of thousands that said will sit on the throne with him and that is what we call the bride all right what we call the bride of christ you can determine it as a the wife of daniel of a revelation where it says in the in the the wife hath made herself ready you can use the word wife you can use the word bride because it is the born-again believer is what you're talking about all right and see if we receive eternal life here we don't have to go through a threat to a judgment there's nothing to be judged for i i kind of like the way the prophet said it one day like this uh you you married your wife but before you marry your wife you're gonna put her through a test to see whether she's worthy for you you know for you to marry her or not now then wouldn't that be something there'd probably be very few weddings uh because it would just the women would back out you know and i wouldn't blame them because if if if i i don't look at my wife to see what she was i look at her to see what she is she is a christian all right being a christian then we put it to the basis of whether or not not whether she was but worthy to be my wife it was the choice i had of making that to where that i could accept her as my wife and see that's what he's done for you and i you just think about it one day that that you'll be able to just walk through those gates and just everything's open and and you can go into the future home that comes present right after this but that's my point of britain see millennium in other words here we are right now give your fights run through here we are right now we're in the time of the last days the ending up of all things the next thing is the message going to israel all right and it will be then a millennial reign of a thousand years upon the earth to really to prove that the sin curse is gone from from the earth that's that's what i like the reason for having a millennial reign is to show that all sin is gone in that point of view and you and i can we can rule and reign for a thousand years then there will be a white throne judgment but not for us to stand but it'll be for the world or the sinner or the person of the world you know that will be there and if they've been good to you maybe they could give each other get a little bit because that's what jesus was speaking of in in his doings you know of of giving us a place of showing what it is so important to be the born-again believer or the bride of jesus christ we don't have to go to those places we don't have to have that we don't have to be judged we're already judged we judge the point by accepting jesus christ and it's not whether or not we're worthy that's not the judgments of the convention it's whether or not he's worthy we say well i know he's worthy well all right then if i know he's worthy then he hath made me worthy it's not what i am it's what he's made me he gave me the opportunity to become his bride and see then that way we will be into that basis of of ruling and writing with him all right now but there's also in the bible another town spoken of that we tried to cover you know into doing it so go ahead brothers and pull that one up into romans so we read that to start with but we want to we want to read it again but look what it says now but why dost thou judge thy brother or why doest thou said it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ all right now all is going to stand before the judgment seat of christ but i just spent 15 minutes explaining according to the bible and what we are to be that we do not have to sit on any we don't have to stand before the whites on judgment so there must be something in our understanding that we need to know that there there is a white throne judgment yes and that's where the sinner goes and that's where those things happen but we'll be sitting on the throne with him judging the others and then now we're talking about another judgment that is in the bible and this is the judgment seat of christ not the white throne judgment it's the judgment seat of christ all right and look what it says for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give an account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another anymore well now look what we're supposed to do but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way in other words we don't want to harm or to hurt or to destroy or whatever the brother or sister that would be called to the bible of a weak faith or whatever is doing it we don't want to do that but but do you see what i'm talking about now you have a great white throne judgment don't miss that because by being born again you do miss that you miss the point of having to satire stand there to be judged all right but see then you come to this that there's a judgment here of the deeds as we'll read in a little bit done in the body whether good or bad and we're going to be judged accordingly now remember my point and i've tried to emphasize about this if it's a judgment seat of christ it will be a judgment of rewards or losing rewards that's what we got to deal with you say losing what no no not losing eternal life now i know no don't don't get no idea in your mind like that no no no point you can't lose eternal life god's not an ending giver he's not going to give it to you and take it away if he gives you eternal life you have eternal life you don't have to worry about that point you're not going to be judged whether or not to receive eternal life because you're not going to sit before the white throne you're going to sit on the throne with him right now all right so then when coming to it then what is this judgment seat of christ what is this position that we have there but it says we shall all stand before that judgment all right we read that one in romans so go ahead and pick up number three which is taken from second corinthians and we'll read that one okay ii corinthians 5 10 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ now i mean that's i just read to you where it comes from romans now hears you two times so in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established right all right so now what are we doing where we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body now keep that in mind according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad right now we've taken out of the picture totally of the white throne judgment because that cannot be there to a christian that is annihilated out of the situation and not even to be thought of then you can't say well i read over here where this happened i read over here where this out all right read all you want to you're just reading yourself out of the will of god because he will that we would have eternal life what is the faith it's eternal life living in us by the new birth all right see then by doing that then we come to a place that there'll be a situation of a judgment seat but all right now let's settle this point i like to do that i like to say this if a means a then a don't mean b right if a means a then a is a and you leave it alone all right so it's so subtle it's out of the picture of the white throne judgment it's placed and and and put forth that there's no argument about it okay now yeah but i think i don't care what you think because you don't care what i think there's nothing in this basis of what we think it's in the basis of what god said all right see then we leave it that way let it be what he says about it okay but he says here twice we've read it in romans and corinthians that there will be a judgment seat of christ and you'll be judged but now get the point now this is not the white throne so it has nothing to do with eternal life it is not a situation of deciding whether you're going to heaven or not that is dealt with in romans and corinthians because this is true the bride of jesus christ right now that's what i like about the way the bible is written it'll say to the saints see all right when you're reading these things then you read it there and in each one of these beginning chapters read the galatians and romans and then it'll say to the saints well who are the saints we're not catholicism we're not dealing with unlike who are the saints the born-again believer to those that are in christ jesus so then to what you're writing then who is it written to now in revelations it's written to the whole world coming up from the book of daniel anybody can read it because it is not a situational pointing of as much of the people as it is what's taking place but when you come into the new testament and it'll say to the saints that are in ephesus that's right well that's born again believers the bible is not written now listen the bible is not written to the sinner the only thing the bible can do to a sinner is make the sinner realize they're a sinner it can't save the sinner it can't do anything for him because he has to accept that to be in his place and then let god come on the scene and work out the salvation of his own but it is it's not the basis that we we try to put this that are there no we we put the word of god whatever the word says all right so then in this why would they be a judgment seat why would they be a judgment seat of christ but we know for sure it is not dealing with eternal life so i'll annihilate that that's what i like to do take that out of the way you know you go argue all you want to what you think about that when the bible takes it out of the way you put it out away all right see then it's not what you say or i say it's what he says all right no [clears throat] then that's not our ideas and our thoughts okay now so we see that there is two judgments evidently in the bible because of the situation as i'm saying the time frame there is no time frame connecting to the judgment seat of christ except for one thing if it would be the judgment seat of christ it would have to be after christ came do you agree it would be after christ came that there would be a time set that they would be a judgment seat of christ but the book of revelations can vary back to the old testament through to the new testament pick up all of the people of the world bring them all into a judgment but yet to the bride there's no way no judgment one because when you accept jesus christ as your savior he died in your place he's not looking no more what me and you do or anything it's what he's done all right see then being that there's evidently two judgments okay one we know for a surety the white throne we know what takes place but we know also then that it's speaking of a judgment seat of christ we've received the time frame elements of thinking about it in the basis that the white throne will cover the whole world time frame you know all world but the judgment seat of christ will not be judging judging that away because it's not a determining of whether or not you're going to heaven or not it's a judgment of the deeds done in the body because paul used the word you know i want to go to body see it's what we do in the body that we're going to have to give an account for but i i see now here's where we throw that line in there but i throw back with you with one thing see we say but now brother dale if i'm a born-again believer you've got just just got through telling me that i'm saved that i can never be lost i agree with all of that i agree wholeheartedly with every bit of it but i agree one thing that that i've been all of my life i don't believe in living like the devil and claiming to be a christian i believe if you live like the devil you are the devil that's the best way of me saying it i don't i just don't play no games with nobody or nothing uh you know if you live like the devil it's just the devil all right but now we are not blame the devil for everything come on i've been preaching to you 50 years almost you know how many times i've said that let's don't blame the devil for everything well the devil made me do it no no no it's my brother he's a methodist minister he said well the devil devil made me do it and said god can't judge me for being evil i said he didn't make you evil you made yourself evil it is not what he made you i said you better be dealing with eternal life all right now so then what is it where would this judgment seat of christ be all right if it's a judgment seat of christ it would be in the time of christ that should be sensible that should be beyond any reproach of thought that it is in a time frame element of the days of eternal life which is now the old testament was not the days of eternal life because eternal life was not back there for them because jesus christ had not died the holy ghost the bible said it had not been given because christ had not been crucified all right so there was no eternal life back there in the old testament in that basis of eternal life like it is today see that ended at calvary in the judgments and things and that's why there has to be a white throne judgment to take care of all of those people that are there there's plenty of jews there's plenty of different groups there's plenty of foolish virgins as we call them there there's different uh sections of people that will have to be judged one of these days but we're beyond that we're in the days of grace all right and being in the days of grace then we know that we we're not to be in the days of disgrace then we're to be into the basis of where the bible says that there'll be a judgment seat of christ now i keep saying it over and over because i don't wan see i know this way you you say something one time people get they can remember that about two minutes you say it two times they might remember at five if you say it five times they'll finally get to where at least they'll remember it just a little bit then you know how i generally do it i try to put a little something in there comical to go along with that point because the comical point will make you remember what i've been talking about okay that's the way that that i try to get your cons to get your attention and to get it to where that i can say look this is it it can't be this because of this it can't be the white throne judgment we can't stand there what do you got to be judged about but yet when it comes to the judgment seat of christ then there is something about that but remember it's not a judgment as much as it is a reward or a lack of rewards it's my way of saying it that's my point of looking at it because i can't see in other words you don't you don't want to take a person that's borne again that's free from all sin and then try to make them a sinner no no no no you don't do that you leave us to what we are but you do realize one thing for sure we're still human beings that's why i spent so lengthy of time there with it and i rewrote a lot of it to to reuse it today but we're in galatians 5 you know that it speaks of the works of the flesh but then it speaks of the fruits through the spirit the works of the flesh is adultery and sin you know like seriousness all kind of things that are taking place that's works of the flesh that's what this flesh does in the word it inhabits a world of a sinful thing but then fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness meekness and desire all like that what is that that's from the inside out coming outward to be lived out into the flesh of mankind what is within us all right and see then it's do it because i'm trying to get you to look at a point that you'd [clears throat] say well what kind of a judgment would that judgment be it's not going to be a judgment now i'm serious i try to be as best as i can with you and i hope you listen to me uh i don't believe there's going to be a time set aside i'm just serious i don't believe there's going to be a set of time times and and you know zach he's got to be judged you know you've been a good boy well yeah i thought i was well you know it's all right but if you had done anything wrong you said no no no you're getting silly because no i'm not silly i'm getting to the point see what is sin okay sin is not drinking gambling smoking running around with women right that's not sin wait a minute now you're a funny preacher no i try to get your point sin is unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already sin is unbelief it is not the things that you're doing that's the works of the flesh that's the things that this flesh gets caught up into and according to paul during galatians he's emphatically stating and remember that is to the church that he's trying to tell the church that she's got problems she's got works of the flesh she's got things there that don't be it's not needed but then he turns around in the same thing and shows how good it is because he deals with the fruits of the spirit right in the same chapter the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace goodness all right now getting the point of where we're living in the hour that we're living all right not of standing before judgment and and me standing before donnie and he standing looks at me and said yeah yeah you've done that i don't you don't have to tell me i've done that because when i get to there there ain't going to be nothing head right it ain't going to be him bringing up something that i tried to hide right it's going to be everybody in the building knows all about each other that's the best way of putting it again right you know there ain't going to be no why no no no hiding this that or the other but but that's that's where you you're funny you say we're born again and that makes us pure that's true but the works of the flesh comes back and gets involved into it right and the things we do in our life the little small things the little foxes the bible says is what spoils the vine it's not the big old fox that turns the whole vine down it's a little old fox that nibbles at the roots and just enough to make it to the word ain't going to be worth nothing it'll die of its own this church if we're a born again christian why would we not want to stand in a position to be right well i don't want to stand before you're standing now [clears throat] because i've got one quote that relates an idea of where this judgment seat of christ comes into view but you know what it's here i thought that the bible said that how is it judgment begins were where does the bible say judgment begins at the house of the lord in other words in the pulpit to the janitor to all the pews and all in between judgment begins at the house of the lord now is that true then that the bible says some men's sins go before them i've got these written here if you need them so some men sins go before them and some follow after you know that everything i ask god to forgive me and i'm really sincere in the basis of that now i put that in there because that's the point you say i asked god but was you sincere like i said how do we wind up doing we wind up and and and i do something to zach you know how i did illustrate i do something exactly well i need to go make that right because that's my brother and if that's my brother that's christ living there all right but you know what i won't do it i just kind of after while i mull it around i know i'm a funny preacher but i this is the way i preach because it's the way i live after a while you know what i begin to think that he was the problem not me you know and you know give me a couple of weeks and you know what i'm telling him or saying he owes me an apology you understand see we let these little things slide by and after a while they get where they don't hurt too much right well i know uh i know we're driving down the road today and and that guy pushed me out and i got mad well where's that for a christian get out of the way the best thing and certainly don't chase him down that wouldn't even fit no christianity you ain't got no pages to put that in the book okay leave him alone wave bye to him say bless you brother he said the way it's working right now i can pray for you but don't try it the second time i might not do it because i'm human oh but i don't have no problems why well i know i told donny off this morning but he knows i love him you understand works of the flesh i ask you to read that i ask you to read galatians 5. i don't ask how many did it i ask you to read galatians 5. he said but brother dale i'm no murderer it says i'm murderer i'm not a murderer the bible says if you use your mouth you condem a brother you murdered him you might want to read them take the dictionary and look up what these words are you might find out you got a few of them or is that the way we want it we don't want to find out we've got a few of them oh no no i've been a good christian i've never had a wrong thought or anything like that no but you just lied well that solves that part because come on you are human can i quote the bible is it not true that in the bible that said that jesus got angry now let's correct that and get it straight okay it didn't say he got mad now go look up the word it didn't say jesus got mad the prophet didn't say jesus got mad he said jesus got angry when he cast him out of the temple now he didn't walk over there i wish i would leave you know you know i got this little whip thing here but i ain't gonna i ain't gonna would y'all mind just leaving the temple and letting us no no no no no no no not mad there's a difference in mad because matt is crazy okay look it up mad at the word mad is literally crazy but when you get to the point that you've got problems bothering you and you're upset that's not crazy that's just the point of a human being well i don't know i don't i don't owe tony no apology well he knows my heart he's been around here a long time he ordered on me a little bit by now that's the problem he does know he knows i'm human i've never tried to make anything to my grandkids or grand kids or or whatever gregory tried to make them think that i was something different than a human being i don't have to go out and just deliberately do things but they know but they know one thing for sure they know papa loves them we had zach here he'd tell you he's the only grandson that i spanked boy i wore him out he'll tell you in a hurry that i beat him to death you know it was it was child abuse sure was i went and get off that ladder and get in the house and quit fooling with me because i was trying to put up some vinyl and every time i'd go up one ladder he'd go up the other ladder when he come i'd get him off that ladder and i'd go up that ladder and he'd go up this ladder you know how old he was three or four somewhere in there but he thinks that i was a mean old guy but he knows i love him right he knows i love him my kids don't have to question and say daddy do you love me no isn't that something no your kids know a whole lot more about you than you think right what are you smiling about on it someone getting grins out of the kids okay they're true hey i don't try to be anything but what i am i've never been nothing but what i am pastor whatever you don't see me trying to build up anything to make it something that i'm what i'm something that i'm not i'm just a i'm a christian i'm a born-again christian you want to talk a little while i see that's what people don't like about me because they know that i'll put it on tape you want to talk about the time that brother branham said in the doorway of a motel with a pistol in his lap because someone had made a remark about his daughter well you don't know what it's true i've been told see brother brown was a human that's what caught me you know what caught me in the bible in the terminologies of it or the thoughts of it in the beginning before i ever heard the message or anything i thought about a man called abraham and all of the things that happened the good and the bad and giving his wife away a couple of times right good and bad what if it is that we're not going to be judged to where they're going to be a class put over here okay y'all go over in that group now cause y'all fit in that sin group but these over here don't fit in that they get an extra that's why i'm thinking what i'm thinking well we're here in the period of time of what's called the stature of a perfect man faith virtue knowledge temple space of god our thought in the a and in the day and the time that we're talking about the adoptions that's mentioned in the bible and brought through of how that paul covers that how that a child is no different but he's untrue under tutors and governors until a time appointed could that be this is where we're at now [clears throat] could it be that we're in a situation now existence of the basis of whether or not we're not made it's not being made in here today of deciding of to going to heaven or not but it's our life living not christ who never got mad and we call it righteous indignation but that don't work too much in that he drove him out of the temple oh i heard a brother trying to explain that one time he said he drove the animals out he didn't drive the people i said well now brother only problem i got is the the animals didn't get there by themselves the people got the animals there so if if he was going to whip anybody he was going to whip the people because they would want to put the animals in the wrong place right see little things little thoughts me well my wife knows i love her i told her 40 years ago and i told her one day if i ever got where i didn't love her i'd tell her no i like to hear the word i love you that's why i made a promise to god you can do what you want to we have signs i know what signs are i know why you pull this one down and leave the two up and what they mean but i know what that means that is a universal sign around the world that says i love you now you're going to tell me it's wrong for me to hold that up i'm going to tell you the background was the one thing that i promised god that every time i'd raised my hands i would give him the sign of i love you you say well that's called no no no i know that means in satan you're going to take a sign language around the world and make it satan know there's a sign language that says i love you have you ever told him you love him i mean really just said lord i love you i'm serious it's good to repent it's good to repent and say i'm sorry but you know sometimes a little word going on the end of it you know to somebody and you say well i'm sorry the way i've been and i love you and i just don't wanna does it hurt say that well i ain't gonna tell nobody to live that's what gets me wade knows if he's here he'd tell you about in a hurry i used to do it man i used to go to these meetings and things and i know how the people of this message are they're so holy and pious you know man i'd walk right up to anybody i didn't care who he was i hugged his neck and told him i loved him wade told me one day he said daddy they think there's something wrong with you i said there is i love them [applause] see i i do i love people well there's no problem to me to hug somebody's neck and say i love you yeah we get on the other side with hugging sisters i got some guys that's waiting now in line where they can hug my wife when we get on the other side [laughter] cause they think she's a good good wife a good housekeeper a good this out of the other doing and i do too me but you see what is those big things it's not the big things that's destroying you enough it's the little things that we don't count as being well i told you that i love you well does it hurt to say i love you does it hurt to be a christian in action you know to try to show christ to others you know one thing for sure your kids gonna act like you you ever watched them you watch them you watch them kids if you don't watch them you just watch them and you'll start walking down the road one day and you got a certain little affliction when you you know you you and you you kind of do and you just watch that grandkid coming along behind you and there's coming behind you because he's acting like paw paw see all right it's the little things that we leave undone it's what i'm getting at it's not a great big i don't think now seriously you think what you want to i don't think there's going to be a building sitting there and we get to a place because you tell me where it's at now that's when i said i've i've studied the message so come on you show me where that place is at where the the judgment seat of christ takes place i've looked through the prophet's message it's only like 300 something times he mentions that but you see why can't we think about it being right now right i don't want no trouble at the river do you let's see if i can find that one in a hurry well get my own notes messed up can't even find it all right if they can pull up number 10 pull up number 10 if you can brothers because we won't spend much time we'll get rid of get going i'll start reading now catch up with me okay and i appreciate many of you people are poorer people than tonight you probably may maybe put in the life nickel you had and that great day when we stand now he's talking about taking people to missionary funds and things that he's taking the money from the people and taking the mission no one going to the mission all right and on that great day when we stand up there at the judgment seat of christ and there's going to be a place there'll be a place to stand or whatever and you hear those heather and screaming when i after you hear my name called and i got to come up and stand on the tape recording will be played and the screen will show at all and some of those natives and heatherns from the other countries saying oh brother branham if you hadn't come i'd have been lost and then god will look down to you and say you were the ones that sent him all right see how he's putting it all together if there's any blessing to be out of it may you receive it because i'm just going do it doing as a duty okay watch them jump down i'll be glad to have prayer with you at any time you pray with me we we meet again is now watch him may we meet again is my prayer somewhere this side of the river of life now where is this judgment seat of christ going to be somewhere on this side of the river of life are you reading and have a good old-fashioned meeting you know there's going to be a after the resurrection about 30 40 days that the saints are going to be among us before the rapture fully takes place where's it going to be and have a good old-fashioned meeting again here in america before we cross the waters i mean that last water i mean the last water it's going to be on this side of the river of life now we as christians there's terminologies of people in their words you may be a little different but you know what i'm talking about on the other side the river i don't want no trouble when it comes down to the river i don't want to answer that or the other i want to be make everything right here before we get down to the river you know i don't want nothing to have to be judged well see that's a good place to be and see that's right now i believe right now is the judgment seat of christ and i believe judgment must first begin at the house of the lord which is right behind the pulpit and go out from there all right not bad things i don't know of ever i've known tony probably what 15 20 30 years something like that man we've been [snorts] around together a long time i don't know of one thing that i could ever think of that i ever thought well tony don't don't love me now that's where you're different than me and i'm not mean against tony because tony sometimes sold up a little bit he may not act like he loves you but see i know he does i know he'd do anything i ask him we used to we'd talk about him and kind of life about him because he was just kind of quiet we got some videos because even his wife didn't know what he could cook nobody didn't know all of these things could be done when we went up on the mountain camping out with all of the kids of the church and all the boys and and here's tony all at once he's grabbing pots and pans and he's cooking and everybody's looking around nobody's saying nothing there ain't nobody hindering him and telling him to stop they're just standing back officer hey hey look at tony he's cooking well you know we found out he could cook now what did hey tony you understand you don't have to show me all of these great big things of the world or give me everything in the world to be a a part of a body of christ or whatever as pastor you don't have to give me a this you don't have to make it every other week that we do these things you know or something well because i'm just what i am i'm just what i am and what i've always been i've always just been the basis that i love people and i want them to love me since the barber back there she had a dream one time and said she saw me walking around and said one time i'd have one on my shoulder i said i'd set it down i'm just talking about you okay so the next time i'd have a different person sitting on my shoulder walking around and carrying them he said that's the way you do well that's the way i want to do i'm trying my best to break it down to one thing listen it's not the big sins that that's the problems with all of us if it is we have ways of dealing we call people up in the front of the church they either repent of this or get out why because we don't want the world to have the idea that we're just sinners and and just living and doing everything in the book i'm like the apostle paul paul was got so upset there where he said a one man you know living with a man's father's wife in other words his stepmother or step wife or whatever he but he tore into him but you know what if that man straightened up paul didn't throw him out because paul knew he was the guy that knew that's what i've tried to tell you for me to read the bible is easy because i've always just read it and studied it and read it and even when i was you know a baptist and just coming to the lord and and i'd read that and i'd get over there where it says and someone so because so-and-so and so-and-so begot so-and-so and so-and-so begot so-and-so and so and so forgot so and so forgot so and so and so forth and while i get so tired of saying so-and-so with a soul i just quit you know but you know what happened one day i began to look over there and it said and so-and-so begot so-and-so and and i'm just paraphrasing one and david said i love you lord you know there's something right in there you know what i'm talking about it'll just be right in the scripture readings of you reading it of the so-and-so of god so and all at once it just brings christ right into view i've always had trouble reading i don't mean trouble i mean i'd rather read somewhere else than read first corinthians and especially ii corinthians not that i had any problems the problem was i found out later paul was talking to me about me because that's what paul is doing the corinthians means literally what it is it means the word of correction corinthians means correction and see that's what paul was constantly after them there that he had to get onto him about the gifts he had to get onto them about all kind of things he had constantly stayed after the corinthians because he wouldn't line up it was the little things that they were just passing on by i'm thinking well bless god we've got it made we ready for the rapture that's what's so odd to me you talk to people and say well brother dale i'm just afraid to go to church because that virus might catch us or something but i'm ready for the rapture i'm ready lord anytime the lord wants to come where's he gonna come is he gonna have to come to your house but we're christians yep the little bitty thing that constantly keep putting us down i'm just talking about me because we're all just human beings we're in that group but paul calls the galatians the works of the flesh now remember he's talking about christians and says they have works of the flesh well i said it's hard sometimes to read to what he's just saying because he calls it adultery first thing he says on the works of the flesh well you don't ever think like this adultery well there ain't nobody here in the building committing adultery what about you're looking and you're lust in your things of your eyes what about uncleanliness being the same as lasciviousness which is lust my brother dale i don't have no problem with lust little small things idolatry idolatry he said we don't have no idolatry we're not we're not worshiping idols webster says the worship of other gods what if you're a trinitarian that's another god because it's just one true and living god little things what about hatred oh i don't hate nobody could it be just a little bit of enmity variance could it be strife or contentious emulations strife just be in contention heresies this being of a sect murderers you hate your brother without a cause you're a murderer that's breaking down the bible to smaller words that we human beings can comprehend do you get it oh no we're not ain't nobody building here murdered anybody one word uttered could be murder now you don't think we're going to have to give an account you don't think we're going to have anything one of these days that there could be a judgment seat i'm trying to get you to see that's that's the problem when we think we don't have it that's where we have it well i don't have no problem right there's the problem you're not admitting who you are and what you're doing what was that uh message brother uh luis is preaching about drunkenness and and about being uh [snorts] how is it drunk on the spirit drunk on the wine drunk on it it's not always this big drinking drinking it's a lot of other things it could be just go home and take that and read it and see how simple the things could be that we have those things hate you brother without a cause you're a murderer what are we supposed to be waiting till one day that there's going to be a great big building we're all going to have to line up in a building and walk down through there and no taking place right now because you see if he takes away rewards that's one thought but what about lining up with the word in your adoption and your stature of a perfect man what about lining up to where you get to these words [snorts] oh i don't have no problems with drinking patience godliness temperance i don't have no temper and paul i'm excused with peter peter evidently thought we had him because he mentions it right but i i just don't i don't you're not getting it brother dale we're we're not getting right i know i'll agree we i'm not getting it i'm not getting to the basis of one thing we're letting these little bitty things why do you think we're here now when i can quote your prophet pretty heavily where he would talk about the coming of the lord was way overdue whose problem is it about the coming of the lord well time just hasn't run out now don't start that it ain't time it's you and me what about it come on musician what about it the prophet of god i'll show you if you want hundred i don't know if not a hundred close to a hundred where he says we must all meet at the white meat at the judgment seat of christ he said i'll meet you there [snorts] we're all going to have to give an account for the little things that we didn't get straight now watch it as i say it taken away is not involved in it because god doesn't give you something and take it away i wish you'd listen to the next few moments it's not that god gives you things and takes it away from you he's not an indian giver he doesn't do those things he'd rather give than to take away what if it is the fact that the reason we're not climbing the statue of a perfect man through the virtues and the things like that the adoptions that we talk about others other doings and all of the child being tutored and trained and governed what if it's not that he's taking away what if it's the fact that we're not we're not walking correctly so we're the ones that are losing the reward what if it is that we're we're giving it up by our actions by our doings you see church that's why i don't preach like all these other preachers and i'm sorry to just i believe in a holy living i believe in living for christ but you don't hear me preaching about women's dress and clothes and hiring and doing all this i talk about what's causing you to do that what's causing you women to cut your hair you have brother dale you're not supposed to know i can look at people's hair and tell whether or not you're cutting it and i never understood that i'm a human come on comical human i never understood it women how you trim your hair and yet you hide it to try to keep people from seeing it but you know you know the reason they see it you cut it straight across what's that why why do you women cut your hair straight across you're automatically telling it's being cut because hair don't grow straight across right you see you look at women and their hair is cut straight across well my hair's never been touched in and uh i talked to one here about that they used to burn the ends of it just a little bit you know you ever thought about that maybe burn the ends of the hair just a little bit that's not cutting it that's see the little thing the tempers and the arguments and the fussing of us husbands and wives i said us the little things you see that's why i don't preach like that because see when i preach it i preach it straight in other words i can tell you i can look i can walk your women across from here and tell you how many cut your hair because you always cut it straight don't do that cut it crooked [laughter] come on what do you mean cap it up it don't look like it's been cut brother [clears throat] the hell you're crazy i agree with you but does it get to point across the little things that we do or don't do and it's not going to be as i said i'll say that one more time i don't believe there's going to be a great big building we're going to have to all line up walk down through there did you do anything wrong did you do i think it's right now i think you and i are setting our stages now in the stature of a perfect man in the adoptional message to thanks it's taking place now now is
