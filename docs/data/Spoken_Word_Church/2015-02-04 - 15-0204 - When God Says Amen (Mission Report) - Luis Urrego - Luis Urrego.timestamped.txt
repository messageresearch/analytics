[5:49] we ask you these things now in the name
[5:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God
[5:56] well I reckon the Lord is just trying
[5:58] our our our patience
[6:01] amen so so I I just could I couldn't
[6:04] believe I was sitting there I was so
[6:06] enthused about getting that I had it all
[6:08] nice laid out and everything and then I
[6:10] had the thing just pops the error it's
[6:13] corrupted I'm like what and I spent all
[6:16] afternoon triy to fix it but anyways
[6:19] technolog is man-made amen but the word
[6:21] of God Amen they can never
[6:24] fail amen let's read this Genesis
[6:27] chapter 2 starting Verse 18 it says and
[6:31] the Lord God said it is not good that
[6:33] the man should be
[6:36] alone I will make him and help me for
[6:40] him and out of the ground the Lord God
[6:42] formed every beast of the field and
[6:44] every foul of the air and brought them
[6:46] unto Adam to see why he would call them
[6:49] and whatsoever Adam called every living
[6:51] creature that was the name thereof it's
[6:54] interesting that God Amen in verse 18 he
[6:57] sees that the man has this need amen
[7:01] that he needs a help meet and
[7:03] immediately he goes to create the
[7:05] animals why didn't he create Eve right
[7:08] there and
[7:09] then amen verse 20 and Adam gave names
[7:12] to all cattle and to the foul of the air
[7:14] and to every beast of the field but for
[7:17] Adam there was not found an help meat
[7:19] for him verse 21 and the Lord God caused
[7:22] a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[7:24] slept and he took one of his ribs and
[7:27] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[7:29] the riv which the Lord God had taken
[7:31] from man made he a woman and brought her
[7:34] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[7:37] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[7:40] she shall be called woman because she
[7:42] was taken out of man therefore shall a
[7:45] man leave his father and his mother and
[7:48] shall cleave unto his wife and they
[7:51] shall be one flesh and they were both
[7:53] naked the man and his wife and were not
[7:56] ashamed praise God you may be seated
[7:58] tonight
[8:01] amen better wait if some get some water
[8:05] something get that lucky
[8:08] cup amen appreciate it praise God
[8:13] brother brandom says here in this
[8:15] message where hear what hearest thou
[8:17] Elijah he says oh how that we need in
[8:20] this journey that we're in now to find a
[8:22] place of rest and to Feast on the word
[8:25] of God so that so that it'll give us
[8:28] strength night after night go to the
[8:31] room and rest and come back the next
[8:33] morning fresh and eat more for there's a
[8:36] great journey and a great battle ahead
[8:39] for the church amen I believe we're in
[8:42] that battle right now
[8:47] amen great I believe that we have been
[8:51] children long
[8:52] enough amen God's going to turn his
[8:56] church into a manhood now amen
[9:00] so we've been discussing amen the
[9:01] stature of a perfect man we're in that
[9:04] process right now each one of us amen
[9:08] and we played and frolicked as children
[9:10] but now we're going to have to put away
[9:12] childish things and take on manhood amen
[9:16] maturity I believe it was Paul who said
[9:19] when I was a child I spake as a child
[9:22] because he thought as a child but it's
[9:24] time that we begin to think like men and
[9:27] women now for we've got to get down to
[9:30] business amen and I believe we're living
[9:32] in a Time amen that it's it's it's no
[9:34] time to play Church no time Amen to just
[9:38] uh just be nonchalant and as I've said
[9:40] before put this thing on cruise control
[9:42] cuz when you put it on cruise control
[9:44] what happens you fall
[9:46] asleep at least that's what happens to
[9:48] me when I put the car in cruise control
[9:50] I fall asleep and if it's like that in
[9:53] physical how much more in the spiritual
[9:55] you know so uh it's it's God calling us
[9:59] to a certain maturity amen and you
[10:02] shouldn't be in the same in the same
[10:04] state that you were 5 years ago amen you
[10:06] should be beyond that now 5 years
[10:09] later but sometimes we're up and down
[10:12] like this like while we're on a roller
[10:13] coaster ride now I know we're going to
[10:15] have our ups and downs we're going to
[10:16] have our ins and outs amen but then we
[10:19] shouldn't be having our backslides and
[10:21] our backslides out and our backslides in
[10:23] backslides out constantly amen praise
[10:26] God we should be amen constant now Adam
[10:30] here God knew when he created Adam uh
[10:34] and put him in the Garden of Eden he
[10:36] knew that he that that in Adam there was
[10:39] going to be a point in time that Adam
[10:41] was going to need to find out that he
[10:43] had something in him in him that he
[10:45] needed to understand that he needed to
[10:48] have amen now Adam didn't know now you
[10:51] you think God God put Adam in such a
[10:54] perfect perfect world there was no sin
[10:58] the animals didn't bite uh everything
[11:01] was perfect amen and he could just enjoy
[11:05] from every fruit of of the tree and just
[11:08] it wasn't that he needed to eat he just
[11:10] could just enjoy amen he could eat
[11:13] grapes he could eat apples he could eat
[11:15] whatever he wanted to and it was just
[11:17] for an enjoyment it was just for
[11:18] pleasure so he had he was living in a
[11:21] perfect world he lived in a in a in in
[11:23] in in a world that you and I amen desire
[11:25] to live in amen and I believe we're
[11:28] heading back to that amen we're heading
[11:31] back to that Perfection because if it's
[11:32] in in us somewhere in US craving that
[11:35] amen then that means that that's
[11:37] somewhere out there for us
[11:39] amen as they said that the the what is
[11:42] it the the the egg had the chicken or
[11:46] the egg had to be first before the
[11:49] chicken or the chicken vice versa you
[11:51] know what I
[11:54] mean but when there's a deep calling to
[11:57] the Deep there's got to be a deep to
[11:58] respond amen so there can't be something
[12:01] that you're craving and it's not being
[12:04] it's not there amen we desire that amen
[12:06] so it's got to be there for us praise
[12:09] God so Adam was put in this in this
[12:12] position amen and and and and if we read
[12:15] let's read back in verse 18 it says and
[12:17] the Lord God said it is not good that
[12:20] man should be alone I will make him a
[12:23] help meat for him so God knew that God
[12:26] was under was was in control
[12:29] man and God thought it wasn't good for
[12:32] man to be alone amen so God was going to
[12:35] make Adam a help meat for him amen now
[12:39] Adam didn't know
[12:41] this God KN knew it Adam didn't know
[12:44] that so it came a point in time amen
[12:47] that that that Adam uh uh he he was with
[12:50] the animals and uh he looked at the
[12:52] animals and and God had a plan for Adam
[12:56] Amen in regards to those to those
[12:58] animals amen amen and and I believe God
[13:01] Amen is mindful of our ways in that way
[13:04] amen he knows the beginning from the end
[13:06] he knows he knows uh uh uh what what
[13:09] your what your end what your end is
[13:11] going to be just like Jeremiah uh says
[13:14] in Jeremiah 291 for I know the thoughts
[13:16] that I think toward you sayth the Lord
[13:19] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[13:23] give you what to give you an expected
[13:26] end so it's an end that it doesn't take
[13:29] God by surprise it's an end that he
[13:32] expects of you amen it's something that
[13:34] he expects it's not nothing that happens
[13:36] in our life amen takes God by surprise
[13:40] God just didn't said amen oh my goodness
[13:42] that happened to Brother Joseph Canada
[13:45] what am I going to
[13:47] do he looks over at at the Angels what
[13:50] are we going to do no no nothing like
[13:53] that takes the price of God Amen it's an
[13:56] expected end that he's bringing you to
[13:57] amen all things work together for good
[14:00] to them that love God Amen somewhere or
[14:02] another it's going to amen it's going to
[14:04] be shaped into his perfect will amen
[14:07] praise
[14:09] God so God brings the animals to Adam
[14:12] Amen to see what he would call them so
[14:17] before I I I I I tell the young people
[14:19] amen before especially the young
[14:22] man before you go out get trying to get
[14:26] married you must have a task in hand
[14:30] in other words you must have a job you
[14:33] must have something that you're doing
[14:34] amen physically cuz you're not going to
[14:37] help support that the the the the the
[14:39] wife amen just with kisses and
[14:42] hugs that's not that's part of it amen
[14:45] but that's not going to bring food to
[14:47] the
[14:48] table so God here before he presents his
[14:51] bride to Adam he gives him a a work to
[14:54] do he gives him something to do that he
[14:57] needs to accomplish before he can have
[15:00] that desire that yet he still doesn't
[15:02] know what it is but through this naming
[15:04] of the animals he'll find out amen so he
[15:08] gives him a task Amen to do before uh be
[15:12] before uh he he comes to that position
[15:16] because see Adam needed to realize that
[15:19] he needed companionship with someone
[15:22] just like the animals had their
[15:24] companion you see the lion had the
[15:27] Lioness the female line you know the dog
[15:30] had female dog and the monkey had the
[15:32] female monkey and all these the the
[15:35] serpent had a female
[15:37] serpent sometimes we forget that there
[15:39] could there was a female serpent too if
[15:41] there was a male serpent there had to
[15:42] been a female
[15:43] serpent so all these all these animals
[15:46] had their own but Adam did not have one
[15:48] for
[15:49] himself so God what does God do he
[15:52] brings the the the animals to Adam
[15:55] amen and let's read down here where it
[15:57] says um
[16:03] verse 19 it says and out of the ground
[16:06] the Lord God formed every beast of the
[16:08] field and every foul of the air and
[16:11] brought them unto Adam to see what he
[16:14] would call
[16:16] them now that's key to see what he would
[16:19] call them not what God would call them
[16:22] but what he would call them
[16:25] amen why because God has so much
[16:27] confidence in the word that that Adam
[16:29] was going to speak it was just as good
[16:31] as what as what God's saying it amen now
[16:35] the question is is does God have the
[16:36] same confidence in the word that you
[16:38] that comes out of your mouth
[16:40] amen because if it's the word of God
[16:43] Amen God's got to say Amen to that do
[16:46] you believe God says Amen to his
[16:48] word amen I believe God says amen if
[16:51] it's his word he's going to amen that
[16:53] and how does he amen it amen by bringing
[16:56] down and confirming that word amen amen
[16:59] praise the Lord so God gives Adam this
[17:03] task to do amen and God gives man the
[17:07] opportunity amen he gives him this
[17:09] opportunity to realize within himself
[17:11] that he needed that companionship amen
[17:14] see God can't do everything for
[17:17] us I if if God did everything for us
[17:20] then there wouldn't be anything for us
[17:21] to
[17:22] overcome how can we be called Overcomers
[17:24] in this life if we don't overcome
[17:26] anything amen but there's going to be
[17:29] some Overcomers in this life right I
[17:31] believe that at every age amen and even
[17:34] in this wicked age there's going to be
[17:36] some Overcomers there's going to be some
[17:38] young people that are going to overcome
[17:40] there's going to be some older people
[17:41] that are going to overcome amen some
[17:43] middle-aged people are going to
[17:45] overcome because we're in the age amen
[17:48] overcome we're living in an age Saints
[17:50] where it's it's it's uh we're supposed
[17:53] to take a body
[17:56] change
[17:57] amen that hasn't happened amen since
[18:00] since the the the well en yeah since
[18:04] Jesus
[18:06] amen and Enoch was the one who who took
[18:09] who took a took a Rapture amen we're
[18:12] supposed to be doing we're supposed to
[18:13] getting back to that to that same
[18:15] position amen as Enoch so we have we
[18:17] have a great thing amen a great task
[18:19] among ourselves amen Saints and we
[18:22] desire that am we desire that just like
[18:26] John says amen so come quickly Lord
[18:28] Jesus right praise
[18:33] God Amen so God can't do everything for
[18:36] us amen some things we have to do on our
[18:40] own or amen or take them by faith amen
[18:44] we can't understand everything we can't
[18:47] explain everything right and if we could
[18:50] then there wouldn't be no need for
[18:53] faith we could explain every single
[18:56] thing I don't understand a lot of things
[19:00] I don't understand many many things but
[19:02] I just take them by faith because I know
[19:05] that he does not lie right am amen and
[19:08] if he said it amen I believe it praise
[19:11] God brother uh if you're reading Numbers
[19:14] chapter 33 I'll read this real quick and
[19:16] if you could pull it up the brothers
[19:18] could pull it up I want you to I want
[19:20] you to look at something here real
[19:23] quick in numbers 33 started at verse 51
[19:27] it says speak unto the children of
[19:30] Israel and say unto them
[19:32] why say unto them when ye are passed
[19:35] over Jordan into the land of Canaan then
[19:38] I shall drive out of all the inhabitants
[19:41] of the
[19:43] land yeah it doesn't say that does
[19:47] it good
[19:49] I it says then ye shall drive out the
[19:53] inhabitants right of the land from
[19:55] before you and destroy all their
[19:58] pictures and destroy all their molten
[20:00] images and quite pluck down all their
[20:02] high places and I shall
[20:07] dispossess no and ye shall dispossess
[20:10] the inhabitants of the land and dwell
[20:13] therein why why why is God telling the
[20:17] children of is Israel this now in the
[20:20] same way he's telling us to do the same
[20:22] thing spiritually speaking because look
[20:24] what happens here it says for I have
[20:26] given you the land to possess it God had
[20:29] already given them the land to possess
[20:31] it now they just needed to go and do
[20:32] what they needed to do Amen to possess
[20:34] it God has given us amen all these
[20:37] promises precious promises he's given us
[20:40] the uh he's given us word precious word
[20:42] amen now you you got to do is take it by
[20:44] faith amen believe it and act upon it
[20:47] and watch it come to pass right it can
[20:50] be the simplest thing God's not calling
[20:53] us Amen to to to do such a great thing
[20:55] like they had they had uh going on here
[20:58] amen but in just our everyday life right
[21:01] Amen in
[21:05] Simplicity uh that's what God is calling
[21:08] us Amen to exercise our faith
[21:11] in now sometimes sometimes we we think
[21:14] well if I could if I could do this or if
[21:17] I could just if I could preach or if I
[21:19] could uh be a deacon if I could do this
[21:21] amen amen but what about you sister amen
[21:24] who who stays at home watching the
[21:26] children you have to live by faith right
[21:29] what of you Brothers amen who who go day
[21:31] every day amen to work you have to live
[21:34] by faith you might not be a minister
[21:36] amen but your life is ministering to
[21:39] somebody amen you might not be
[21:42] a a deacon you might not be none of
[21:45] these things amen but you are affecting
[21:48] somebody's life amen through your life
[21:51] Somebody's Watching
[21:53] You Somebody's Watching
[21:56] Me praise God amen so it's it it's up to
[22:02] us Saints amen God has already given us
[22:05] the promise God's already given us
[22:06] everything that we need of for this
[22:08] journey and it all Lays inside of you
[22:11] amen you just may you got dig into that
[22:14] word amen and stay with that word and
[22:17] keep on day by day taking it one day at
[22:19] a time amen and watch you're
[22:21] dispossessing
[22:24] then you're on grounds right there Amen
[22:26] to dispossess the enemy amen praise
[22:31] God Amen so if we continue here going
[22:35] back to Genesis chapter I just wanted to
[22:37] let you all know that to show you amen
[22:41] that God God thinks more of you than
[22:43] what you think of
[22:45] yourself God knows that you can that's
[22:48] why the scripture says that I can do all
[22:50] things through Christ who strengthens me
[22:53] praise
[22:55] God now let's go back to Genesis chapter
[22:58] uh two and continue reading verse 19
[23:03] here and it says here and whatso and
[23:06] whatsoever Adam called every living
[23:08] creature that was the name thereof
[23:11] period so everything that Adam said
[23:14] amen one day Adam was walking walking
[23:17] and all of a sudden he heard
[23:22] a I can't make the sound just like it
[23:25] but does it sound
[23:27] close
[23:31] he hears it
[23:36] again and he hears this roaring so he
[23:39] finds and he sees a lion and how how how
[23:42] how how the the the hair around his hair
[23:45] and how powerful he looks and he said
[23:47] you know what I think I'm going to call
[23:49] this
[23:50] lion and God down up God up in heaven
[23:53] amen God just looking at Adam and he's
[23:55] just probably just crossing his arms and
[23:57] looking down at to his son and says
[24:00] that's son just called him Adam I mean
[24:03] lion hey man I like
[24:07] that amen that's exactly what I was
[24:10] thinking Adam so then so then Adam Adam
[24:14] is walking one day and he hears
[24:22] this do you all know what that
[24:27] is
[24:29] see that I if it wasn't for the
[24:31] Nicaragua trip that probably would have
[24:32] been able to get it
[24:35] better he sees this this this this this
[24:38] animal in the sky flying so high the the
[24:41] wings are are are are are so huge and
[24:44] and he sees how high this animal can
[24:47] fly and he he says my look how how high
[24:52] that animal can fly and my goodness look
[24:55] at the wingspan on that I think I'm
[24:57] going to call him Eagle amen and God was
[25:00] looking up in heaven and he said amen
[25:04] Adam it's exactly what I was
[25:07] thinking amen son I like that and then
[25:12] another time that Adam was walking by
[25:15] and he hears
[25:21] uh that sounded more like a horse than
[25:24] it then but it had a big old trunk huh
[25:29] huge huge uh
[25:31] animal and he said I'm going to call
[25:33] that an elephant and God said I was
[25:36] thinking the same thing son my goodness
[25:39] I was thinking the exact same thing
[25:42] amen and then one day he sees a little
[25:45] white little bird and and he's looking
[25:47] at it and and and the little bird lands
[25:49] on him and he's petting it and and how
[25:51] sweet it was and it was so tender
[25:53] looking and Adam said you know it's not
[25:56] like the other animals it's so tender So
[25:59] Soft amen so white so clean I think I'm
[26:01] going to call him
[26:03] Dove and God said
[26:06] what he had to say Amen cuz that's
[26:08] exactly what God was thinking amen so
[26:12] God Said Amen to every single thing that
[26:14] Adam called all the animals amen God
[26:17] Said Amen to it amen and whatever you do
[26:21] Saints just bringing it back home L man
[26:23] whatever you do can God say Amen to the
[26:26] things that you do in life right brother
[26:29] amen now remember he can only say Amen
[26:32] to to his
[26:34] word and whatever you do amen and
[26:36] whatever you think and the way you act
[26:38] and the way you react if it's not
[26:40] according to the word he can't say Amen
[26:41] to that he can't bless amen nothing
[26:46] outside of his word but he did with Adam
[26:50] right and he put this task before Adam
[26:53] and Adam fulfilled the task amen Adam
[26:56] completed the task
[26:58] praise
[27:00] God
[27:02] Amen so and continue reading here in
[27:06] verse 20 it says and Adam gave names to
[27:08] all
[27:09] cattle and to the fowl of the air and to
[27:12] every beast of the
[27:14] field but here's the key thing but for
[27:17] Adam there was not found an help meat
[27:19] for him so when naming the animals and
[27:22] and looking at the animals and and and
[27:24] spending this this time with the Animals
[27:26] Adam realizes that they have Partners
[27:29] but he didn't have a partner himself and
[27:32] that's where God wanted to put Adam that
[27:34] was the position where God wanted to put
[27:36] Adam right there and then cuz he wasn't
[27:38] just going to give him Eve just like
[27:41] that although Eve was already in
[27:43] him you you see where I'm trying to get
[27:46] to Evil's already in him but he did not
[27:49] know that right he did not know but God
[27:53] put him in a position where he needed to
[27:56] realize and desire that he himself and
[27:59] God sometimes needs to put in positions
[28:02] amen where you can't turn anywhere else
[28:04] amen but to him where you realize that
[28:06] his word is right and I'm going to go
[28:08] with it amen he puts you sometimes in
[28:11] positions amen where he's going to see
[28:13] let me see what brother Wade's going to
[28:14] do in that certain
[28:18] situation and then you think amen
[28:20] sometimes you think in those certain
[28:21] situations Lord why am I in this
[28:23] position why why why are you allowing
[28:26] this in my life God wants to test to see
[28:29] what your reaction is going to be if it
[28:31] going to be according to his word or not
[28:34] am
[28:35] amen God loves doing that why because we
[28:39] are his
[28:43] children you know I I we've done that to
[28:47] ourselves to our to well I just say to
[28:49] to
[28:51] Bella we we deliberately test her
[28:54] sometimes to see what her reactions are
[28:56] going to be and then according to her
[28:59] reactions if she failed then we can go
[29:01] ahead and correct her now if we do that
[29:03] in this in the physical how much more
[29:05] the Lord he loves doing that to his
[29:07] children why because he's building
[29:09] character in our lives amen and in this
[29:12] name in The Animals it wasn't just for
[29:14] God to for Adam to just name the animals
[29:16] it was God trying to bring bring
[29:18] something out of Adam that he didn't
[29:20] know that was there amen So Adam
[29:24] realizes amen all these animals have
[29:26] female counterpart and I don't have mine
[29:29] praise
[29:31] God and so he couldn't find it in the
[29:34] line he didn't find it in the giraffe he
[29:37] didn't find it in the monkey he didn't
[29:38] find it in the
[29:40] serpent and just in those same things
[29:42] Saints amen you young people you can't
[29:45] find satisfaction Amen in any of the
[29:47] things of this life either of the
[29:50] Earthly animals of this
[29:52] life now you can't find it in Facebook
[29:55] you can't find it in YouTube you you
[29:58] can't find it in your cell phone you
[30:00] can't find it amen all those things are
[30:02] temporary and they're going to perish
[30:05] because they're
[30:07] Earthly amen you're not going to find it
[30:10] amen in the two Souls you're not going
[30:12] to find it in the in the return Ministry
[30:14] you're not going to find it in the uh uh
[30:17] all the doctrines that are out there now
[30:20] you can go from one to the other just
[30:22] bounce back and forth like a pingpong
[30:23] machine amen and you won't find true
[30:26] satisfaction in none of them right if
[30:28] it's outside of the
[30:31] word just like Adam amen he couldn't
[30:34] find satisfaction in any of those
[30:35] animals amen those Earthly beasts you
[30:38] won't find satisfaction in the beasts of
[30:39] this
[30:40] life amen unless it's in the word of
[30:44] God praise God CU nothing really
[30:46] satisfies the true the the the believer
[30:49] only
[30:51] Jesus only Jesus Give Me Jesus
[30:55] amen amen so
[30:58] after Adam does his part amen then God
[31:03] goes ahead and does his
[31:05] part and what does AD what does God
[31:08] do he puts Adam to
[31:12] sleep and he goes ahead and starts
[31:15] working a work in his heart in his life
[31:18] amen takes the rib out and from there he
[31:22] forms a woman right
[31:24] amen I I and and Adam amen he had he had
[31:29] peace amen and he had confidence amen
[31:31] that that God was doing a work in him in
[31:34] him amen and he just went ahead and
[31:36] rested in
[31:39] God and in resting amen look what the
[31:43] outcome was that
[31:45] was that's what we should do amen is
[31:47] just rest in the Lord amen that he knows
[31:49] what he's doing he knows what's what
[31:52] every every he knows every single detail
[31:55] of Our Lives amen and how to get us Amen
[31:58] to the to the End
[31:59] Amen praise God so he puts Adam to sleep
[32:03] and and out of him the the Bible says he
[32:06] creates he creates uh the woman takes
[32:09] the rib out Amen in verse 21 it says and
[32:12] the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to
[32:13] fall upon Adam and he slept and he took
[32:15] one of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[32:18] instead thereof and the rib which the
[32:20] Lord God had taken from man made he
[32:22] woman and brought her unto man right so
[32:26] Adam wakes up just as God in verse I
[32:29] believe it was verse 19 God brings the
[32:31] animals to to to to to
[32:34] Adam God does the same thing with with
[32:37] Eve brings her to Adam he didn't come he
[32:40] didn't go to Eve amen Eve came to him
[32:43] because God brought him to her I mean
[32:46] her to him
[32:48] amen and so I can just imagine when Adam
[32:52] still just wakes up and he sees this
[32:54] female counterpart amen he may not
[32:58] understand it right away amen but all of
[32:59] a sudden something just clicks amen
[33:01] that's exactly what I was looking for
[33:04] it's exactly what I needed Amen in verse
[33:07] 22 it says here and Adam says and Adam
[33:11] said this is now bone of my bones and
[33:14] Flesh of My Flesh now as Adam called the
[33:19] animals and named the
[33:20] animals here he also he's calling the
[33:23] woman amen by
[33:26] inspiration
[33:28] amen and and God didn't say up there no
[33:31] no no don't call her
[33:32] that no that's exactly what God was
[33:35] thinking too and Adam said this is now
[33:37] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[33:39] she shall be called woman because she
[33:43] was taken out of man right and God said
[33:48] amen
[33:49] amen cuz that's exactly what God was
[33:51] thinking
[33:52] too amen so you notice here that Adam uh
[33:57] now now doesn't just give the woman a
[34:00] name but he says that she is bone in my
[34:03] bone and flesh in My Flesh in other
[34:05] words she's just like me exactly she's
[34:09] just like me glory amen I wonder
[34:13] sometimes if we think of our wives that
[34:16] way you remember is she bone of your
[34:18] bone flesh of your flesh
[34:22] amen and and
[34:24] Adam if if I I always thought if if God
[34:28] would have just given Adam he you know
[34:31] Eve you know just without him realizing
[34:33] that he needed a female
[34:35] counterpart when Eve would have
[34:38] fallen he could have just said well Lord
[34:40] just give me another one because I don't
[34:42] you know this
[34:44] one no but he came to a point that he
[34:47] loved Eve so
[34:49] much because she came out of him amen
[34:52] she Lo he loved her so much that if what
[34:56] happened to her amen
[34:58] he he he wanted to be there for her as
[35:02] well no matter what happened amen he
[35:05] fell with her as well right because they
[35:09] were both one unit amen they weren't
[35:11] both separate
[35:12] units they were both one
[35:16] unit and sometimes amen we we live our
[35:19] lives amen as husband and wives and
[35:21] one's got a bank account here and the
[35:23] other one's got a bank account here
[35:26] amen
[35:28] that's not going to
[35:38] work
[35:40] well it's not what Dave Ramsey
[35:49] taught heyen but just giving as an
[35:53] example you know cuz and then the man
[35:57] you know know and one doesn't want to to
[35:59] share with with the other this is my
[36:02] money I I worked for this you get your
[36:04] own
[36:05] money you know you all should work as
[36:08] one unit amen you're one amen and you're
[36:11] one for one for one goal
[36:14] amen your one goal first of all to be
[36:17] Christlike second of all God's given you
[36:20] a family that you need to raise amen and
[36:22] those children are looking at youen and
[36:25] if you know how to work as one unit amen
[36:27] those children will learn that value
[36:29] amen that I should work with one as one
[36:32] unit as well
[36:34] amen ones off doing this here about and
[36:37] then and the other one does not know
[36:38] anything about it you know praise God
[36:42] right let me just get off
[36:48] that look I just speak for
[36:52] experience I if I say anything here it's
[36:56] because amen the the
[36:58] I've
[37:01] experienced
[37:02] amen but but but you know I appreciate I
[37:06] appreciate my wife and I appreciate amen
[37:08] that we we we have that mindset to work
[37:11] as one unit
[37:12] amen praise
[37:14] God and it's taken me several
[37:18] lessons cuz I'm a hard I'm a hard
[37:22] learner several knots in the head Amen
[37:25] to learn that you just don't leave leave
[37:27] your wife amen just by herself you know
[37:30] whenever you want to just leave the
[37:32] house you know and amen but you know she
[37:35] has needs too right when you get home
[37:38] from work even though you've worked all
[37:40] day even though you've you've sweated
[37:42] all day but it hasn't been as rough as
[37:45] dealing with children in the house at
[37:48] least you're by yourself dealing with
[37:49] with with with you know just working you
[37:51] know it's not as rough get to the house
[37:53] and you've been talking 5-year-old
[37:55] language all day long
[37:58] and when the woman greets you when the
[37:59] wife greets you at their house she you
[38:01] know she greets you in a 5-year-old
[38:03] language you
[38:05] know cuz that's how she's been dealing
[38:07] with all day long she wants to talk to
[38:09] an adult when she gets
[38:11] home so to get down to the level as man
[38:15] that was hard that's hard but that's
[38:19] that's a sacrifice that's something
[38:21] amen that's beneficial for each one of
[38:24] us so through marriage amen
[38:28] we we become more like him
[38:31] amen and we appreciate and learn things
[38:34] that we wouldn't have learned otherwise
[38:38] amen so God God doesn't see amen doesn't
[38:43] see you like any other
[38:45] woman he doesn't see you like any other
[38:48] other other other uh denominational
[38:52] women out there amen he sees you special
[38:55] you're come from him amen you're you're
[38:57] elected amen you're bone of his bone
[39:00] flesh of his flesh life of his life and
[39:02] he'll do whatever he can Amen to make
[39:05] sure that you come and draw and become
[39:08] to his very
[39:09] image he won't let his
[39:12] children out if you're his child amen
[39:15] he's going to make sure that you come
[39:17] Amen to him
[39:19] amen cuz I've been out in the world I've
[39:22] done these things I've I've I've I've
[39:24] backslid and and done these things but
[39:26] if you're a true child of God something
[39:28] in you just won't leave you
[39:31] alone I mean I just uh I know that for a
[39:35] fact I just can't get away from
[39:37] God I just can't get away from no no
[39:40] matter how much I want to throw the
[39:41] towel throw in the towel I still can't
[39:44] get away from him and I just thank God
[39:46] Amen because it's been him amen holding
[39:48] me I can't hold myself it's been him
[39:50] holding
[39:53] me praise God appreciate the Lord amen
[39:59] so
[40:02] so let's read real quick here at uh in
[40:05] Joshua Joshua chapter 10 and just give
[40:09] an example amen another example Joshua
[40:13] chapter
[40:17] 10 and starting at verse
[40:20] 5 well I'll just I'll just I'll skip a
[40:24] lot of this
[40:25] but I'll just start at vers 12 it says
[40:29] then spake Joshua unto the Lord in the
[40:31] day when the Lord delivered up the
[40:32] amorites before the children of Israel
[40:35] and he said in the sight of Israel son
[40:39] stands thou still upon gibian and thou
[40:42] moon in the valley of
[40:44] aelon and what did God
[40:48] say God said
[40:51] amen and the sun Stood Still and the
[40:53] moon stayed until the people had Avenged
[40:56] themselves upon their enemies
[40:58] is not this written in the book of
[40:59] jasher so the sun Stood Still in the
[41:02] midst of heaven and hasted not to go
[41:05] down about a whole day and there was no
[41:08] day like that before it or after it that
[41:12] the Lord listen to that that the Lord
[41:14] hearkened unto the voice of a man
[41:17] amen amen amen amen so the Lord does
[41:20] hearken to the voice of a man when that
[41:23] voice amen and that word is according to
[41:25] his word amen for the Lord fought for
[41:29] Israel amen so that's the Lord is
[41:32] fighting for his children tonight amen
[41:34] amen and if his word is on our lips amen
[41:37] God no matter what happens no matter
[41:40] what you go through amen if it's
[41:41] according to his word God will just say
[41:44] Amen to that
[41:46] right if you say if you say to this
[41:48] mountain be removed and don't doubt in
[41:51] your heart amen but
[41:53] believe then you shall have that period
[41:56] amen because it's according to his word
[41:59] amen amen so when Joshua told the Sun
[42:01] and the Moon to stand still right God
[42:04] said
[42:05] amen praise God see God had already told
[42:09] him to possess the
[42:11] land and that he had already delivered
[42:13] the amorites unto
[42:15] them and all they had to do was just act
[42:18] upon
[42:19] it that's all they had to do so don't be
[42:22] afraid Saints to act upon the word of
[42:25] God Amen if it's the word of God Amen
[42:28] just take it as it is and move on with
[42:30] it and remember the way God amens his
[42:32] word is by vindicating it in your life
[42:36] amen just as God Amen had no no doubt
[42:39] whatsoever that when he gave the animals
[42:42] to Adam to name God knew that he wasn't
[42:44] going to speak outside of his word
[42:47] therefore he knew that he could amen
[42:49] every single word that came out of Adam
[42:51] right because it was his word amen now
[42:54] that bride Amen in this day amen she
[42:57] won't speak outside of this word even
[42:59] the prophet said that she can't speak
[43:01] outside of this word because they're one
[43:04] unit amen they're thinking the same
[43:07] thing and therefore they will speak the
[43:09] same thing amen praise God how many love
[43:12] the Lord
[43:13] tonight sir amen so I trust that that
[43:16] little thought was helpful to you cuz I
[43:18] know some of us you know we're going
[43:20] through some things and uh and you just
[43:22] wonder why the Lord why Lord why am I
[43:25] going through this and why happened and
[43:27] all of a sudden you know but you know
[43:30] what God's in control God God has
[43:32] confidence in
[43:33] you that you're going to react the the
[43:36] the right way and if you fail like
[43:38] brother Wade was saying Sunday and if
[43:40] you fail that test well you can retake
[43:43] it
[43:44] again cuz if you're his child you're
[43:46] going to retake it
[43:47] again until you get to that Amen to each
[43:51] level
[43:54] Amen to we come to the stature of a
[43:57] perfect man right amen praise God that's
[44:00] what I desire
[44:01] Saints thank you
[44:03] Lord praise God um if we want to bring
[44:07] up the PowerPoint
[44:09] presentation of whatever I had left of
[44:14] it
[44:16] um the
[44:18] uh as I said as I said uh brother Mike
[44:22] Sebert if if some of you don't don't
[44:24] know who he is he's a brother from
[44:26] Dayton Ohio
[44:27] uh he pastors a church over there I
[44:29] believe it's called Open Door Church
[44:31] something like that I've never been to
[44:34] his church before but I met brother Mike
[44:36] S A couple of years ago at at the Ruth
[44:38] North Carolina camp meetings and he
[44:40] found out that I I you know I I do some
[44:44] interpretation work so he asked me uh
[44:48] about four years ago if I could go to
[44:49] Nicaragua with him and uh I told him
[44:53] that I would but that during that same
[44:56] time uh um opportunities for me to go to
[44:58] the Philippines were were coming up so I
[45:01] felt led to go that direction so for
[45:03] three years brother Mike was asking me
[45:05] to go to Nicaragua and I told him either
[45:08] I I had you know I had to go to the
[45:09] Philippines I had made a commitment to
[45:12] that and then one year we were we were
[45:14] in Canada and I just couldn't make it
[45:16] that time but this year he uh well
[45:19] towards the end of last year he called
[45:21] me up and he said uh are you available
[45:23] this time to go to Nicaragua and I said
[45:26] well I'm not planning on going anywhere
[45:28] this this coming year brother Mike he
[45:30] said well let's go ahead and take care
[45:32] of those tickets
[45:34] then he said you're going there's no
[45:37] excuse this time so so uh but you know
[45:40] what uh I even if I didn't have the plan
[45:43] to go amen I I believe it was in the
[45:45] will of God for us to be there amen and
[45:48] uh we certainly enjoyed ourselves and uh
[45:52] uh I believe the people of God were
[45:53] blessed and I appreciate each and every
[45:56] one of you who who who who took part in
[45:58] helping me send uh in helping me go
[46:01] there amen whether it was financially or
[46:03] your prayers I really appreciate each
[46:05] and every one of you and certainly uh uh
[46:09] I could go into so many more details
[46:11] some more details of the of some things
[46:13] that took place there but uh we'll see
[46:15] what the Lord brings to my
[46:17] remembrance since my PowerPoint
[46:19] presentation's
[46:22] shattered amen so let's uh let's go
[46:25] ahead and go to the next
[46:28] next slide for those who don't know
[46:31] nicar Costa Rica and Nicaragua is
[46:34] located in Central America and there's
[46:37] there's my home country right
[46:41] there
[46:44] Colombia but uh so um uh so Costa Rica
[46:50] this is Nicaragua right here and then
[46:52] this is Costa Rica right here um just a
[46:56] quick fact the current population of
[46:58] Costa Rica is approximately 4.94 million
[47:02] the capital of Costa Rica is San
[47:09] Jose
[47:11] okay I promise I won't there you go you
[47:14] guys see
[47:17] that technology is awesome until it
[47:24] crashes thank you brother way
[47:27] um uh for those who don't know Costa
[47:29] Rica has become one of the top
[47:31] destinations for Americans to retire at
[47:34] a lot of Americans and they retire they
[47:36] go down there to retire so
[47:39] uh and believe it or not they take
[47:41] dollars down there yeah you can pay with
[47:44] dollar
[47:45] anywhere same thing in in Panama I
[47:47] believe and Nicaragua was the same thing
[47:50] for the most part uh the and now the
[47:53] current population of Nicaragua is
[47:55] approximately 6.2 million ion the
[47:58] capital of Nicaragua is
[48:00] managa uh Nicaragua is the largest
[48:03] country in Central America so you can
[48:05] see it's it's the biggest out of all of
[48:08] them um and uh both countries are
[48:11] located in Central America both are on
[48:13] the on Central Standard Time so it's not
[48:16] like it was in the
[48:17] Philippines some of you ask did you did
[48:19] you get jet lag no it was just one hour
[48:22] behind so so no jet lag but but brother
[48:26] is going to get some jet lag here in a
[48:28] couple of
[48:30] weeks so uh let's go to the next
[48:35] slide uh this is brother Mike Sebert for
[48:38] those who don't know him um he's a
[48:41] pastor at Dayton Ohio started doing
[48:43] youth camps in South Central America
[48:44] he's also done in India and Europe about
[48:47] 20 years ago so he's really dedicated I
[48:50] and also he has his Youth Camp that he
[48:52] does in Ohio as well every summer um so
[48:56] he's really dedicated he he loves he
[48:58] loves the youth and uh he's really
[49:00] dedicated himself in the last 20 25
[49:03] years doing this uh he's been going to
[49:05] Costa Rica and Nicaragua for the last 18
[49:08] or 19 years some of the young people who
[49:10] attended his first youth camps are now
[49:14] pastoring churches or helping in the
[49:16] ministry in some way or another I met I
[49:19] met uh down there several Brothers I
[49:21] mean just 28 29 years old uh one of them
[49:25] was about 25 years old and they're
[49:28] pastoring churches now yeah um so the
[49:32] Brethren down there some of them are are
[49:34] are really into missions in that in the
[49:36] area I mean they get up there going into
[49:38] the mountains and Honduras and
[49:40] everything so these are really dedicated
[49:43] dedicated youth that uh and these youth
[49:45] camps have been very beneficial CU you
[49:47] can see the fruit of them you know right
[49:50] so let's go to the next
[49:54] slide uh we went to uh Costa Rica on
[49:57] January the 2nd I left here January the
[50:00] 2nd uh they get no sleep at all because
[50:04] my flight left uh at 700 in the morning
[50:06] that day and I I had to be in the
[50:08] airport about 4 in the morning 5: in the
[50:12] morning but uh we were in no in in Costa
[50:15] Rica for for two days and this is
[50:18] Brother this is where we held the uh the
[50:20] meetings at uh in San
[50:23] Jose uh this is Brother mono kua's
[50:25] Church t and has said and that's brother
[50:28] brother Monica another great servant of
[50:31] the Lord he's done a lot of work in
[50:32] Central America so go ahead and the next
[50:38] slide you can play this video and if you
[50:40] can turn it up you can hear
[50:43] what hopefully it
[50:51] plays you just don't know how these
[50:53] things are going to react
[50:55] when
[50:57] anyways this is when we when we got to
[51:00] to the to the church and uh I was just
[51:03] giv a little
[51:05] report uh and uh we were getting ready
[51:08] to to eat and we were going to have the
[51:11] first service that night so as soon as
[51:15] we got there I mean it was time to work
[51:17] there were no time to lay
[51:20] down so we're getting ready to eat have
[51:25] some lunch and I think we're GNA have a
[51:27] service tonight so
[51:33] um so you can go to the next slide
[51:39] um all right so this is the service that
[51:41] that that night that first night there
[51:44] was some other people uh that were
[51:46] coming in in the next two two uh the
[51:48] next two days that came
[51:52] in this is just a song
[51:55] service
[52:14] uh this really uh really wonderful
[52:17] people uh really
[52:20] uh really humble really enjoyed being
[52:25] with
[52:27] this this uh meeting was they
[52:30] usually uh hold the meetings and and
[52:34] they they have several churches that
[52:36] come together uh but this time uh they
[52:40] decided to to have other meetings at the
[52:42] same time going on at the same time in
[52:44] other areas um and so there wasn't as
[52:47] many people as there usually
[52:49] is
[52:51] um
[52:53] so this was more like a Family Camp than
[52:55] it was a youth camp this first Camp so
[52:59] all right next
[53:02] slide now this is the this is that first
[53:05] night um brother Co brother Tim the
[53:08] master amen and she
[53:12] realized that same
[53:14] power can take me
[53:17] back amen amen hallelujah
[53:23] hallelujah we need the prophet
[53:27] and we need the
[53:29] message but it is equally
[53:32] important that we have the power of the
[53:35] Holy
[53:37] Ghost amen amen that's the power that
[53:40] makes the word
[53:43] live that's the power that overcomes
[53:46] Satan it overcomes
[53:49] Temptation it overcomes the
[53:51] world it takes you away from this
[53:55] world to the presence of
[53:57] Christ amen God
[54:00] Almighty
[54:02] amen
[54:03] amen in the message earnestly contending
[54:06] for the
[54:10] faith brother re says the very animal
[54:13] that she was
[54:18] watering was the very
[54:21] animal that packed her to see her
[54:25] bride
[54:28] what those other girls were
[54:32] thinking look at Rebecca she's a
[54:36] fanatic first of all she's following a
[54:41] man second of all she's watering that
[54:44] crazy
[54:50] camel but Rebecca
[54:52] knew this is a special C
[54:57] amen amen this C is going to take me
[55:02] away from all of
[55:05] this amen amen
[55:09] amen you kind of get a get a little uh
[55:13] brother Tim cross was one of the easiest
[55:15] ones to interpret for you know because
[55:18] he take he gives you time you know to
[55:20] interpret but uh let's go to the next
[55:23] next one brother David Siler those uh
[55:26] well this is right after this one but
[55:28] this um this is a little uh youth
[55:32] service that they have with for for the
[55:33] children brother Mike has he loves to
[55:36] sing with them that song I'm sure you'll
[55:38] know what it
[55:41] is H H
[55:50] Hall hallel hallu hallelu hallelu
[55:59] glor
[56:02] glor
[56:07] hallu
[56:12] hallelu
[56:25] hallelu amen um we had uh during the the
[56:30] the service for the adults there was
[56:32] usually a little service for the
[56:34] children going on as well so this is one
[56:36] of the services that uh that they were
[56:39] but Tim cross he spoke it to the
[56:40] children at this specific one um I was
[56:44] saying Brother David Syler he's an
[56:46] evangelist from brother Donnie Reagan's
[56:48] church and uh he uh he was there as well
[56:52] and um he's a fireball
[56:54] preacher if you're know and uh I didn't
[56:59] know but during that time uh when I was
[57:02] uh about the second day that I was there
[57:04] I was coming I was coming with something
[57:06] and I I I was getting sick and Brother
[57:08] David Siler me interpreting for Brother
[57:10] David Syler did not help at all he shot
[57:13] he shot my
[57:15] voice and uh if you turn go to the next
[57:18] slide I think I think this is yeah this
[57:21] is him
[57:22] ministering just listen to his real
[57:25] quick
[57:27] he said Lord I don't know what your name
[57:30] is You' never told me what your name
[57:33] is but when God spoke to
[57:35] Moses I am am it's because Moses needed
[57:40] a present
[57:42] God he didn't say I was I will be but I
[57:47] am right now I am a
[57:50] present I a
[57:52] pres so he revealed him in the way he
[57:55] wants to be known
[57:58] the reason this message never
[58:02] go
[58:04] amen this message can never go out of
[58:08] day this Bible can never
[58:12] grow because this is the book
[58:15] T that sent Moses to
[58:18] Egypt that same God has spok this
[58:22] hour and he has sent us a Vindicated
[58:25] prophet
[58:26] not just a
[58:29] prophet
[58:32] IND you believe
[58:35] that amen let's try that
[58:41] together we're going to try that
[58:43] together and the church say amen
[58:47] amen amen amen not just a
[58:52] prophet a
[58:54] vated prophet with
[58:58] I believe that don't you you realize why
[59:00] was
[59:02] that God sent this
[59:05] m you can kind of get an
[59:08] idea and he he preached a really good
[59:11] message that night was about blind bmus
[59:14] never heard it preached that way before
[59:16] but we had a good time next slide I
[59:19] believe this was at the end of the
[59:20] service we prayed for a lot of people
[59:22] and they they
[59:25] they
[59:34] I told some of the people that and but
[59:37] they'll probably experienced this by the
[59:39] way you you preaching the me preaching
[59:42] the word is is is different than when
[59:44] you're praying for people praying for
[59:47] people it just it it literally it it
[59:50] wears you out I mean it wears you out
[59:52] praying for people and you know what the
[59:53] prophet went through and especially when
[59:56] people pulling on the gift that he
[59:58] had you
[1:00:02] know but the people there were really
[1:00:05] really hungering for God I mean you
[1:00:07] could tell uh that
[1:00:10] uh the word really has an effect on the
[1:00:13] people you
[1:00:15] know um so
[1:00:22] okay all right um next slide Brother
[1:00:27] Anderson all right now the the next the
[1:00:30] next that was uh Frid Saturday night and
[1:00:33] then the next uh Sunday morning uh
[1:00:35] Minister again listen to a minute here
[1:00:41] it I said Jeremiah can't see
[1:00:45] nothing it don't look
[1:00:49] like his time on
[1:00:54] this time on this
[1:00:57] the
[1:00:59] has may look like nothing
[1:01:17] right you know it's not an interpret in
[1:01:20] interpreting it's not it's not you're
[1:01:23] interpreting word by word sometimes you
[1:01:25] have have to take As an interpreter you
[1:01:27] have to take the thought that's being
[1:01:29] said and and and and bring it to to the
[1:01:33] people in a way in the level that
[1:01:35] they're going to understand it it's not
[1:01:37] it's not just the thing about just
[1:01:39] interpreting word for word cuz even when
[1:01:41] the when the brother Brandon's messages
[1:01:43] are interpreted or translated you can't
[1:01:45] translate it directly word for word
[1:01:47] exactly how you said it you have to take
[1:01:49] the thought and then bring it bring the
[1:01:51] thought to the person in the best way
[1:01:54] and so the same thing happens when
[1:01:55] you're in interpreting uh and so all
[1:01:57] that's going on at the same time that
[1:02:00] you're sitting here straining your voice
[1:02:03] and uh but I just thank God Amen that he
[1:02:06] gave me the strength to do to do so am
[1:02:09] amen um this is uh This Is Us just a

[1:02:59] any gross food or anything like
[1:03:03] that cuz I was with American Brethren
[1:03:06] and they wouldn't dare touch places like
[1:03:09] that so brother Mike and then they would

[1:07:00] front just giving their heart to God you
[1:07:02] know and we were ministers just praying
[1:07:05] over each one of them I took a couple of
[1:07:06] seconds of video of it go ahead brother
[1:07:17] Anders don't see
[1:07:24] that
[1:07:48] amen um oh by the way back in Costa Rica
[1:07:53] uh there was about uh there were several
[1:07:55] people that got baptized as well so um
[1:07:59] so that was wonderful to to see this is
[1:08:01] uh this was on that Thursday that
[1:08:03] Thursday night or that Thursday
[1:08:06] morning I had not interpreted the
[1:08:08] meeting started on Monday I had not
[1:08:10] interpreted or done anything until
[1:08:12] Thursday because I just couldn't and
[1:08:14] Thursday is when I finally got an
[1:08:16] interpreter for brother Zach brother
[1:08:18] Zach he's from
[1:08:20] Arizona Zach
[1:08:23] Wallace I think his dad is
[1:08:28] his wife's name is
[1:08:36] Hannah and they're very
[1:08:39] Brown they have no
[1:08:42] water and as I looked
[1:08:45] across there was one place where a great
[1:08:48] way to start back
[1:08:50] up they put me with Brother David Tyler
[1:08:53] right away although Brother David how it
[1:08:55] got to a point where he didn't want he
[1:08:57] wanted me to interpret for him and uh I
[1:09:01] said well I I had to tell him I I said
[1:09:03] but David remember i' I've been sick and
[1:09:06] and uh you need to make sure that
[1:09:08] because when you're up
[1:09:11] there the people if if your voice is
[1:09:14] overriding my voice I can't get the
[1:09:16] thought the people are not going to
[1:09:17] understand what you're saying if I can't
[1:09:18] tell the people if I can't express it to
[1:09:20] them so if if if I can't express it to
[1:09:22] them it's just like just two crazy guys
[1:09:24] up there just just going back and forth
[1:09:26] you know and so he he understood and uh
[1:09:30] and now that was that was Thursday night
[1:09:33] um for some reason
[1:09:38] um that's brother Daryl Ward he's
[1:09:40] ministering and I interpreted for him
[1:09:41] that
[1:09:46] night
[1:09:48] he why he was the witness he had made
[1:09:53] contact you know what he said
[1:09:56] I am not
[1:09:57] ashamed
[1:10:01] the for is the power
[1:10:12] of uh that night I had I was somebody
[1:10:15] else was going to interpret for him but
[1:10:17] I just really felt strong to interpret
[1:10:19] for brother Daryl that night and uh I
[1:10:22] told Brother Daryl I said brother Daryl
[1:10:23] is it all right if I can interpret for
[1:10:25] you you cuz brother usually he takes
[1:10:27] brother uh another brother with him to
[1:10:29] interpret for him usually and brother
[1:10:31] Daryl said as long as brother the
[1:10:33] brother Danny doesn't mind you go ahead
[1:10:35] and interpret for her so we fixed it up
[1:10:37] to where where you know and we had we
[1:10:39] had a great service that night uh and uh
[1:10:43] brother Daryl said that um that after
[1:10:45] the after the service that night he said
[1:10:48] that uh what happened was is that he
[1:10:50] just felt led that the people just put
[1:10:52] their hand on on each other and just
[1:10:54] pray for one another other and as they
[1:10:56] were doing that you know the Holy Spirit
[1:10:57] just came down and just uh it was a
[1:10:59] sweet presence in there and he said that
[1:11:02] he was walking by every row every row of
[1:11:04] people and there was this one sister who
[1:11:08] said that he that that that that Tuesday
[1:11:10] night she could not she could not get to
[1:11:13] the prayer line that there was a prayer
[1:11:16] line and uh he said that he and she said
[1:11:19] that she was praying for within herself
[1:11:21] she said Lord if uh I was not touched
[1:11:24] because in in those countries you know
[1:11:26] they they feel like if you touch them
[1:11:28] you know that it just helps their faith
[1:11:30] you know he said I was not touched that
[1:11:32] night and then at just about that just
[1:11:35] about that time brother darl Ward goes
[1:11:36] and puts his hand on on her as she was
[1:11:39] thinking that so God knew amen what she
[1:11:41] was thinking of and at that moment
[1:11:43] brother Daryl put his hand on her he had
[1:11:45] no idea that that's what she was
[1:11:46] Desiring and uh so later on she told us
[1:11:49] that testimony told Brother Daryl amen
[1:11:53] um after the services were over that the
[1:11:55] Youth Camp that week uh we went to
[1:11:57] another part of Nicaragua and we uh
[1:11:59] ministered at one of the churches there
[1:12:10] and it's just not completely there but
[1:12:15] that uh that Friday before it was the
[1:12:17] last night of the camp and I I had
[1:12:19] interpreted for Brother David Siler and
[1:12:22] 20 minutes into the preaching uh I went
[1:12:24] into a cing coughing fit I just could I
[1:12:28] coughed for about 5 minutes luckily
[1:12:30] there one of the other brothers stepped
[1:12:32] in help helped me and uh then until I I
[1:12:35] got better and I was able to get back in

[1:18:23] down but uh
[1:18:33] so okay
[1:18:39] you you can pause it
[1:18:42] brother amen um I'm just trying to
[1:18:46] remember things that took place we there
[1:18:48] was one night when we were having
[1:18:49] Services there in in in the mountains
[1:18:51] this drunk man came in right off the
[1:18:53] street and uh he said uh he said can you
[1:18:57] just pray for me I just need prayer uh
[1:19:00] could pray for me he said I I he said I
[1:19:04] left I left one one uh um what is it he
[1:19:08] said I left something to go into
[1:19:10] something else in other words he had
[1:19:12] left uh and something to go into
[1:19:14] drinking and stuff and he's like from
[1:19:16] one thing to the other and so I just me
[1:19:18] and another brother we just stood there
[1:19:20] and we just prayed for him and you can
[1:19:22] smell alcohol on him and really strong
[1:19:24] and everything we prayed for him and he
[1:19:26] said brother I I go to church here
[1:19:28] locally um but but I don't know
[1:19:31] something just led me to just come in
[1:19:32] here and get you guys to pray for me and
[1:19:35] so we just did what you know if he was
[1:19:38] there well praise God we gave him he he
[1:19:40] said he said could you give me something
[1:19:42] to eat as well so he said I want to also
[1:19:44] take it to my mom so we gave him a a
[1:19:47] plate to eat and uh um and he just went
[1:19:51] on his way you know apparently he lived
[1:19:53] just around the corner but uh just those
[1:19:56] things like that you know just seize the
[1:19:57] moment you know when those those those
[1:19:59] those times come um these these sisters
[1:20:03] and these Brethren that came uh also
[1:20:05] these young people um there was they
[1:20:08] were given uh clothes as well brother
[1:20:10] brother Donnie Reagan's Church provided
[1:20:13] a bunch of clothes for them um they were
[1:20:16] also given the little books I believe
[1:20:18] that sister uh Monica has downstairs for
[1:20:20] the young people walk with me I think it
[1:20:23] is Bunches of those were given in
[1:20:25] Spanish to them uh they had we had
[1:20:27] activities with them um so it wasn't
[1:20:31] just uh ministering to them but it was
[1:20:33] activities with them as well just
[1:20:35] dealing with them uh so uh we we just
[1:20:39] had a really good time with with them uh
[1:20:42] some of them right there are heading
[1:20:44] back to their places this down here is
[1:20:47] when we were packing up there's the
[1:20:49] Jeeps that we were riding in packing up
[1:20:51] heading back to managa 7-hour drive and
[1:20:54] this is some of the terrain that we were
[1:20:55] Drive riding in some of it very really
[1:20:58] really rough and uh let me tell you
[1:21:01] riding side sideways on in a car like
[1:21:04] that it gets you really
[1:21:06] dizzy I mean there was several times we
[1:21:08] had to stop just because brother and
[1:21:10] they would they wanted a barf
[1:21:13] and and uh it's not like the same as if
[1:21:17] you're riding you know the way you
[1:21:18] usually ride in a vehicle so uh but uh
[1:21:22] we got back we got back okay and uh next
[1:21:25] slot we're almost done
[1:21:29] here this is some of the sisters they're
[1:21:32] cooking they cooked
[1:21:35] uh I mean they just gave in their gave
[1:21:38] in their what they had amen for the for
[1:21:40] the young people in that camp and this
[1:21:42] sister right here look how young to me
[1:21:44] she's very young she's got like eight
[1:21:48] children and and
[1:21:51] uh we prayed we prayed for all uh a lot
[1:21:54] of them would come up and she came up
[1:21:57] for prayer some of them had ailments but
[1:21:59] the majority of the thing that they
[1:22:00] always came up for is that pray for my
[1:22:02] spiritual life I want to be more like
[1:22:05] Christ and um one of the little girls
[1:22:08] she came up she didn't even she she was
[1:22:10] she was deaf and uh no she was dumb she
[1:22:13] couldn't she couldn't speak I think she
[1:22:15] was deaf too well brother Mike prayed
[1:22:18] for her and uh he asked if she could say
[1:22:22] something after the prayer well she
[1:22:24] tried died so but we we just believed
[1:22:27] you know that God was going to do
[1:22:28] something for this little girl well
[1:22:30] later on that that that evening she
[1:22:32] started you could see she was going
[1:22:34] around trying to talk to the people
[1:22:37] trying I mean it was like she was she
[1:22:39] was she they prayed for me I'm going to
[1:22:41] try you know I'm going to do and and and
[1:22:43] and her voice I mean she it seemed like
[1:22:45] she was saying things clearer than she
[1:22:47] was before the service at least that's
[1:22:49] what people were the people were telling
[1:22:51] me so hopefully maybe next time I get
[1:22:53] over there and she completely healed
[1:22:56] amen sometimes amen God doesn't do it
[1:22:58] right away may take just little by
[1:23:00] little amen but if you speak to this
[1:23:02] mountain it could be just little Little
[1:23:04] Rock by Little Rock but it'll happen if
[1:23:07] you believe amen uh there another
[1:23:12] slide
[1:23:14] uh and uh this is some of the young
[1:23:16] people they're getting clothes and
[1:23:20] uh I just really appreciate it for the
[1:23:23] things that they you get next
[1:23:28] slide uh this was in Costa Rica there
[1:23:31] some of the area where we were at this
[1:23:33] is uh in the camp in managa some of the
[1:23:37] sisters that cooked in Costa Rica and
[1:23:38] this is the area around where Co in
[1:23:40] Costa Rica where we were at the church
[1:23:42] is located at just real beautiful view
[1:23:45] next
[1:23:48] slide um this is at in the
[1:23:51] mountains and just praying for a sister
[1:23:54] there this is Brother Brad
[1:23:56] yon um he's from brother Donnie Reagan's
[1:24:00] church next
[1:24:03] slide um so that might be it
[1:24:07] so um so Saints I appreciate your
[1:24:10] prayers and I appreciate the the Satan
[1:24:12] battled us amen but we were able to to
[1:24:16] overcome amen I just I was I felt like I
[1:24:20] was there to do a job and I wanted to do
[1:24:21] the job and Satan was really hindered
[1:24:23] because it wasn't just me that got sick
[1:24:25] some of the other interpreters got sick
[1:24:26] too and some of the ministers that went
[1:24:29] there they started trying to come with
[1:24:31] something so I went down there and
[1:24:33] brother Tim cross was sick too so uh it
[1:24:36] was it was real rough but we we I
[1:24:38] believe God did what he wanted to do and
[1:24:42] uh a pastor last week called me the
[1:24:45] pastor brother Pedro and he two weeks
[1:24:48] ago he called me and he wants me to go
[1:24:50] down there in September and uh I told
[1:24:53] him I'd pray about it
[1:24:55] but he they're going to have a 4-day
[1:24:56] camp meeting that they usually have in
[1:24:58] September and so you pray with me on
[1:25:01] that that he wants me to be one of the
[1:25:02] speakers there so you pray with me that
[1:25:04] the Lord would just have his way because
[1:25:06] if I go down there I have open doors now
[1:25:09] to minister in Honduras to minister in
[1:25:11] Costa Rica
[1:25:13] Nicaragua um so it's opened up some more
[1:25:16] doors for for us Amen to do some of
[1:25:19] these young young Brothers they go to
