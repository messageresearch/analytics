[23:04] creation of God all right that's to this
[23:07] age and time now this is to where the
[23:10] things that's required in this age
[23:14] because we're talking about a Rapture a
[23:16] change and things like that so you know
[23:19] these are the things required for us in

[23:24] and that's what we're supposed to be
[23:26] talking about in this age right
[23:28] a change of the body not that we're
[23:30] going to die and go by the grave that's

[24:58] blessing to the reading of the
[25:10] word now we've we're trying to
[25:14] uh talk about this stature of a perfect
[25:17] man and uh you know I'm honest to say
[25:22] this
[25:23] and that's
[25:25] so Wade got a note there while ago about
[25:28] where he'd been preaching on the Daniel
[25:30] 7 or Sunday school on the Daniel 70
[25:32] weeks and the brother said these big
[25:35] name or something big preachers said
[25:37] they don't uh They Don't Preach on these
[25:40] things well how many of you hear them
[25:43] preaching on the Statue of a perfect man
[25:45] we don't need that we're we're up here
[25:47] we're we're up way above we we're in The
[25:49] Headstone well how'd you get
[25:53] there that's the only
[25:55] question I say it without any Reserve or
[25:58] thought or whatsoever if you are at The
[26:00] Headstone or have the headstone then you
[26:02] had to come this way yeah no other way
[26:06] cuz there's not another way to get there
[26:07] well we're just born in this age oh
[26:09] that's Glory ain't it yeah we're just B
[26:12] well you
[26:13] know
[26:15] no listen the prophet said these things
[26:18] are required
[26:20] right now something's required means is
[26:25] it it's got to be done amen all right
[26:28] and see then that way we know for a
[26:30] certainty God has made a way for these
[26:34] things and for your Prophet to say that
[26:37] that for 30 something years he waited to
[26:40] bring
[26:41] this you know bring it on out into the
[26:43] open the way he would seeing things well
[26:45] that certainly must be something great
[26:48] and wonderful for doing those things all
[26:51] right but see we just think well oh we
[26:53] we're we're just born why brother Dale
[26:55] don't understand we're born again up
[26:57] here we we up here at this lady of see
[26:59] an age we don't have to worry about this
[27:01] well how'd you get up
[27:03] there we're just born up here well Glory
[27:07] Hallelujah you just born
[27:10] somewhere I guess you born kin folks to
[27:13] something you know I'm K folks to the
[27:15] prophet that's the reason I know I'm
[27:16] going
[27:17] well sorry to tell you you firstborn kin
[27:20] folks to the
[27:22] devil according to the Book of Ruth
[27:24] that's right now so we need to know how
[27:26] to get rid of that folks to the devil
[27:29] and then we could talk about kin folks
[27:30] to something else right lenes won't get
[27:33] us there right okay now but now see most
[27:37] people don't preach on things now I'm
[27:40] just honest I wrote this in my own notes
[27:42] no most preachers Don't Preach on these
[27:45] things why because they don't understand
[27:47] them
[27:48] amen that's right well I know all about
[27:51] this yeah it's like a brother one time
[27:54] he came by here and brother Mo was
[27:55] preaching on these things and like the
[27:58] statue of a perfect man all and he was
[27:59] talking about something in there and he
[28:01] said the brother said don't tell me
[28:03] about it let me let me let me study it
[28:05] out
[28:06] himself well he came back about 6 months
[28:10] later he had studied it
[28:13] out and he had to
[28:17] Rapture
[28:18] in Wesley's age the sixth
[28:23] age he had to Rapture in the sixth age
[28:26] you know why cuz brother randam said the
[28:29] brotherly
[28:31] kindness would be the time of the
[28:33] Rapture so brotherly kindness is
[28:35] Philadelphia boy that was great see he
[28:38] spent 6 months studying if he' just sat
[28:40] down and listened to a few tapes that's
[28:43] right but they're not going to do it cuz
[28:44] see that's not not made for that way and
[28:46] it's not meant to be that way so all
[28:48] right we're not no problems but the only
[28:52] thing I would say to you out there on
[28:53] the internet if my pastor wouldn't
[28:55] preach on telling me how to get get up
[28:57] to the Statue of a perfect man I'd find
[28:59] me another one amen that's right that's
[29:01] as honest as I can be with you I'm not
[29:02] pastoring no internet but I'm just
[29:04] telling you that's exactly the way I do
[29:07] all right cuz your Prophet said if your
[29:10] if your pastor don't believe in Hebrews
[29:11] 13:8 get away from him no that's that's
[29:15] all right but now what was we talking
[29:18] about we talking about this past
[29:20] Wednesday you know we've been talking
[29:22] about this stature of a perfect man
[29:24] we've come through faith as a new birth
[29:28] you know and personal experience of
[29:31] Faith all born again Believers come the
[29:34] same way through faith then these are
[29:36] the requirements that would come in this
[29:38] age for us to come because the word
[29:41] would be given all right we would come
[29:43] from Faith to
[29:45] Virtue right how do you get virtue well
[29:48] I just have to have it so I'll get it
[29:50] well how do you get
[29:51] it how do you get knowledge well I just
[29:54] study the word well like I said you you
[29:56] you got people that has memorized the
[29:59] entire
[30:00] Bible but know nothing about the truth
[30:03] of the god of the Bible right so that
[30:06] doesn't fit too good but we come up to
[30:08] Faith virtue knowledge all right
[30:12] Temperance was our last point and
[30:15] remember we were talking about what the
[30:17] prophet had to say about Temperance and
[30:20] he says on the uh statue of perfect
[30:23] man paragraph 228 and all through
[30:28] 29 uh no excuse
[30:30] me uh 219 he's talking about Temperance
[30:34] he said it doesn't mean to stop drinking
[30:36] alcohol not in this
[30:38] case stop drinking alcohol is a
[30:41] wonderful Temperance but that was known
[30:43] in the day you know probations and
[30:45] probations every you say those word and
[30:48] and you know alcohol and Temperance see
[30:51] see he says not in this
[30:53] case it's not Temperance there is not
[30:56] just a not not drink alcohol that's
[30:58] wonderful
[30:59] thing virtue is not to just be a virgin
[31:02] life that's a wonderful thing but when
[31:05] you turn it to Holy Ghost
[31:07] virtue see it comes down to strength and
[31:10] life and living and things and Holy
[31:12] Ghost knowledge is not just knowledge of
[31:15] the letter of the word but it's what's
[31:17] been revealed to you cuz you know how I
[31:20] state it I only have I I wish I had
[31:23] what's in my brain revealed to me that's
[31:26] right am but it's not so it's what he
[31:30] wants to reveal to us all right see then
[31:32] it's not in the brain to be revealed you
[31:34] know it has to come down into the soul
[31:37] of the individual all right but see what
[31:40] is then coming down to Temperance as a
[31:42] holy ghost
[31:44] Temperance not to just stop drinking
[31:47] alcohol but how to control your
[31:52] tongue but brother
[31:55] Dale uh I I I when I got born again I
[31:59] got rid of all these
[32:02] things you know I I I got everything I
[32:06] needed when I got born again well the
[32:07] baby's got everything it needs when it's
[32:09] born again lay it over to the side of
[32:11] the room put it in a bed until tell it
[32:13] you'll see it when it grows up to 20
[32:15] years old you'll come back now that
[32:16] don't work too good does
[32:18] it that's a carnal illustration it don't
[32:20] work too good the baby's going to be
[32:23] dead right and that's what's wrong with
[32:24] the people reason they don't have these
[32:26] things things are not taught it they're
[32:29] required but see but brother Dale I
[32:32] Temperance how to control my temper I I
[32:35] never have had a
[32:37] temper well why you red face
[32:41] now why are you trying to prove to me
[32:43] you don't have
[32:45] one see just go ahead and let people
[32:48] around you find out what it is right and
[32:51] see then
[32:52] it's that
[32:54] ungodly uncontrollable temp
[32:57] emper of of blasphemian names paragraph
[33:00] 140 141 but I but when I got born again
[33:04] I I got rid of everything I you know I
[33:06] did I I I I I become so weak I was Meek
[33:09] and humble and just cross them with the
[33:12] words see
[33:15] what just cross them with the word and
[33:17] see what happens all right then you say
[33:20] but a Christian is not supposed to have
[33:22] a
[33:23] temper
[33:25] well why why would Peter say you need
[33:30] Temperance
[33:34] amen right
[33:37] amen why would God spend so much time
[33:40] and I talking about Wednesday in the
[33:42] Bible speaking about a Temperance and
[33:44] things and how that we needed to
[33:48] be you know somebody speaks to our to us
[33:51] we say Okay praise the
[33:54] Lord Road R you know
[33:58] bless God I'll run down you know you
[34:01] that's
[34:03] uh good Temperance in it all right but
[34:07] you
[34:09] see we have the prophet called
[34:12] it a man-made Saed
[34:16] up belief or
[34:20] Temperance I didn't say that he
[34:23] did like I said now why would Peter say
[34:25] we need temperance if we don't need it
[34:28] why would he say add
[34:31] Temperance if we don't need
[34:34] it see brother Bram even covered it he
[34:37] said Jesus got
[34:40] angry and drove him out of the
[34:43] temple but he's the god of
[34:45] temperance right right the Bible says be
[34:51] angry what and sin
[34:53] not other words something happens to you
[34:56] Road
[34:57] rage the first thing is sure anybody
[35:00] well you're not done that but didn't say
[35:02] well well thank you Lord I didn't get
[35:05] killed cuz the Bible says be angry sin
[35:07] not let not the sun go down on your
[35:11] wrath right you know my way of saying
[35:14] it somebody does something to you say
[35:17] for I forgive you I forgive you pra God
[35:21] get rid of that cuz if you don't you'll
[35:23] start saying something back the next day
[35:26] that's why it say let not the sun go
[35:27] down on your wrath cuz if you keep that
[35:30] that part of you the next day you're
[35:32] going to start
[35:34] justifying yourself right well I I
[35:38] really it really wasn't so bad anyway
[35:40] they don't understand me it really
[35:42] wasn't that bad see you'll wind
[35:45] up all
[35:47] right but what is
[35:50] it these things now let's go on into the
[35:52] thought
[35:54] now see you remember how I was trying to
[35:57] bring it out Wednesday
[35:59] night that these things must be the
[36:03] prophet said
[36:04] vocalized together all right now see if
[36:09] it's the right kind of
[36:11] Faith then if the right kind of virtue
[36:14] is brought in it will vulcanize to
[36:17] that Co why same
[36:22] material you don't vulcanize iron to rub
[36:28] same material so what is the new birth a
[36:32] born again experience a revelation of
[36:34] Jesus Christ what is virtue how do you
[36:37] get virtue by the revealing of God's
[36:39] word right right so that will type that
[36:43] type of virtue will add or vocalized
[36:46] together what about knowledge not head
[36:49] knowledge but holy ghost knowledge
[36:52] knowledge to know the word is
[36:54] right all right and and to see then that
[36:57] that'll vocalize together right all
[37:01] right Temperance
[37:04] then see the right kind of temperance
[37:07] will vulcanize together with all the
[37:10] other so it's all the same
[37:13] material now as we come to
[37:16] patience then think of it that
[37:18] way that this patience we're talking
[37:21] about is Holy Ghost
[37:25] patience not our
[37:28] patience we got a good many scriptures
[37:30] we're going to read a lot on this one
[37:32] you know in the scriptures because I
[37:33] want you to to do and this evening we'll
[37:35] try to uh we're going to have to do it
[37:37] two-part so we'll have to continue
[37:39] Wednesday night on this evening's
[37:41] message but what is now you add all of
[37:45] these
[37:48] together now remember how we were saying
[37:51] it you don't get virture knowledge
[37:53] Temperance patience then get the new
[37:55] birth
[37:57] right it won't work amen those are just
[38:03] man-made nature given cuz the prophet
[38:07] said you know Blasphemous n statute of
[38:08] perfect man that these virtues you know
[38:11] people have a portion of these and not
[38:12] even born again you've been around
[38:14] people you love to be around because of
[38:16] their nature their ways and their
[38:18] kindness
[38:19] and but you've been around people that
[38:21] claim to be
[38:23] Christians then I'm honest sometimes I
[38:25] want to get up and go where the sinner's
[38:27] at
[38:29] yeah right that's about as truthful as
[38:32] you can be all right but see what is
[38:35] each one of them is an extension of the
[38:38] other
[38:39] amen if it's added to it it has to be
[38:41] the same
[38:42] material all right so then being each
[38:46] one
[38:48] added see you can't have virtue before
[38:51] you have
[38:53] faith well I need knowledge that's what
[38:55] I need you can't have knowledge until
[38:57] you have virtue right now we're talking
[39:00] about Godly virtues we're not talking
[39:03] about head knowledge you can have all
[39:05] the head knowledge in the world and
[39:07] that's
[39:08] wonderful praise
[39:10] God but remember it's just laying in
[39:13] there waiting on
[39:16] you to where the Holy Ghost can Quicken
[39:20] it you see what I'm getting at you say
[39:22] well I just I don't need these other
[39:24] things I just need
[39:25] knowledge
[39:27] but it won't
[39:29] work you got to have faith first virtue
[39:32] which is a Christian Life lived in
[39:35] Christ to people to see the strength to
[39:38] pass you remember to let it go out to
[39:40] the people where they can see it and see
[39:42] then Holy Ghost knowledge that's
[39:45] Revelation that's not head knowledge
[39:50] amen oh we thought we had Holy Ghost
[39:52] knowledge didn't we you remember how we
[39:55] was when we argue with you the way to
[39:57] baptize with father son Holy Ghost cuz
[39:59] the Bible says
[40:02] it oh that was really Holy Ghost
[40:04] knowledge wouldn't it then Peter come on
[40:07] over 10 days later or something be
[40:09] baptized in the name of Jesus
[40:11] Christ well I just believe what Jesus
[40:15] said now that's wonderful knowledge
[40:17] isn't
[40:18] it but it's not Holy Ghost
[40:21] knowledge mainly that's
[40:24] stupidity but it sure ain't Holy Ghost
[40:26] those knowledge all right now so then is
[40:30] what I'm saying then you have to have
[40:33] this before you can have this you have
[40:35] to have this you got to have faith first
[40:37] then virtue then knowledge then
[40:41] Temperance before you can have
[40:45] patience well I just have patience I
[40:48] just got patience I I've got a lot of
[40:50] patience you know what
[40:55] yeah now what about
[40:58] it well no I I I I need Brother D for
[41:01] you to tell me how good I am and what I
[41:02] am as a Christian and what the end time
[41:04] is and what this is to be and where
[41:05] Russia is coming down in the White House
[41:07] the lady getting in there I need all of
[41:08] these things I need this this that and
[41:10] the other I don't need
[41:12] this simple
[41:17] stuff well you know
[41:19] what I've always found one thing in
[41:22] God the greatest
[41:25] revelation that he could ever give me is
[41:28] the most simple
[41:30] thoughts that could ever
[41:32] be amen because that's the only way I
[41:35] can understand
[41:37] it
[41:39] right all right but see
[41:42] then you get the point now you got to
[41:45] have faith you got to have virtue you
[41:47] got to have knowledge now you can say
[41:50] you got
[41:51] Temperance now we'll read one today
[41:54] sometime where brother BR said you come
[41:56] off all this way
[42:01] now come on I thought you were supposed
[42:03] to read the message did he not get over
[42:05] at the back of the
[42:07] message and did he not say fill me up
[42:11] Lord with this virtue knowledge
[42:13] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[42:15] kindness and love he said fill me up
[42:18] that I may teach others Apostles
[42:20] prophets pastors evangelist and teachers
[42:23] for the bringing of these things into
[42:25] the body of Christ
[42:29] you you didn't read
[42:33] that but it's just like I heard today
[42:35] where the brother had said that what we
[42:37] need to do is is we preachers and things
[42:40] we need to
[42:41] just kind of introduce brother brandham
[42:44] and then put on
[42:47] tapes well if that's the way you believe
[42:49] it go ahead how fun at it you no
[42:52] argument with
[42:54] you but you missed that quote he just
[42:56] said right that I may teach others the
[43:00] Bible does not
[43:02] say the prophet of Malachi 4 is for the
[43:05] perfecting of the Saints now I want a
[43:07] scripture on
[43:09] that it says the 5old ministry is for
[43:12] the perfect and now the 5-f ministry is
[43:14] only supposed to preach to you what the
[43:15] prophet preach that's righten I
[43:19] understand that this certain brother
[43:20] said that and all of the congregation
[43:24] was was any of you there when he said
[43:28] it was you shouting oh okay sorry to put
[43:32] you on the spot you the one that said it
[43:34] so it was said
[43:36] right maybe not the words that I said
[43:39] but the
[43:42] thought that to just play see years ago
[43:45] he sent me a note and telling me that I
[43:47] need to uh I still got it where that I
[43:49] needed to just preach on Wednesdays and
[43:52] play tapes on
[43:53] Sundays well see now he's moving it up
[43:56] until is we just introduce brother
[43:58] random and let him
[44:00] preach
[44:01] okay it's bringing a lot of patience to
[44:04] us right CU you
[44:08] know
[44:10] okay I no problems anybody whatever you
[44:13] believe is left up to you you on
[44:15] internet what you believe is your
[44:17] business you and Lula what you believe
[44:20] is
[44:21] yours but just remember I'm going to say
[44:24] what I believe the Lord giv is me I'm
[44:26] going to try to put it in prophet's
[44:28] message so I believe the Bible said
[44:31] five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of
[44:32] the
[44:33] saint I believe the fivefold ministry is
[44:36] only to take what the prophet said and
[44:38] bring it to the congregation
[44:41] amen and that way it'll bring these
[44:44] virtues into being okay amen maybe it's
[44:49] oh we like that one what is patience oh
[44:51] yeah we like that one don't tribulation
[44:52] work as
[44:54] patience
[44:56] now if we get a little time to get over
[44:58] there in a few minutes I got a scripture
[45:00] that comes a little bit before then that
[45:02] I'd like for you to explain if
[45:04] tribulation worketh patience and I
[45:06] believe that right I believe tribulation
[45:09] worketh patience but not tribulation the
[45:12] way you're thinking
[45:13] it and we're not talking about the Great
[45:16] Tribulation no no no we're not talking
[45:18] about
[45:19] that it could only be if it works
[45:23] patience it can only be I'll put this in
[45:25] now and then we'll get back to it can
[45:27] only be tribulation could only work
[45:29] patience if it's tribulation over the
[45:32] word
[45:37] right not because you go out and do
[45:40] something wrong and they persecute oh
[45:41] people's against me and people against
[45:44] me they don't like me down at work I
[45:46] know I'm a little bit mean and arrogant
[45:47] and hateful but they just don't like me
[45:49] tribulation work as
[45:54] patience wait do we get on over a little
[45:56] bit more
[45:57] okay what is
[46:00] patience all right now according to your
[46:04] strongest
[46:06] concordant uh 20 5281 I think he's
[46:11] right yeah
[46:14] 5281 and what does it say patience
[46:18] is patience
[46:20] enduring patient
[46:23] continuance patient waiting
[46:26] means
[46:28] steadfastness consistency
[46:31] endurance in the New Testament the
[46:33] characteristics of a man who is not
[46:36] swerve from his deliberate purpose and
[46:39] his loyalty to Faith and piety you know
[46:43] which is godliness by even the greatest
[46:46] trials and sufferings patiently and
[46:50] steadfast patient steadfast waiting for
[46:54] patient enduring sustaining
[46:57] perseverance where do we get down in a
[46:59] minute where the Prophet said that God
[47:02] has patiently
[47:04] waited do you realize he has patiently
[47:06] waiting on you and I 50
[47:10] years since the death of the
[47:13] Prophet
[47:16] right than be 51 now I guess wouldn't it
[47:20] because he died in
[47:22] 1965 God has patiently you know that God
[47:26] is patiently according to the Bible
[47:27] waiting on a
[47:30] Resurrection come on so let's get into
[47:33] it what is it it's enduring in other
[47:37] words it's it's putting up or keeping
[47:40] waiting you know not getting ahead and
[47:43] and doing but waiting and then we'll get
[47:45] down to some more where you know that
[47:47] that God gives us the patience but you
[47:50] know the patience is spoke of a lot in
[47:51] the
[47:53] Bible all right see I decided to use
[47:56] this way on this one because it kind of
[47:57] breaks up the other we just reading but
[47:59] all right go ahead now we've got a lot
[48:01] of scripture to read so I told him he
[48:03] could just put up a bunch of them and we
[48:05] just keep reading Luke 8
[48:08] and5 Jesus talks about
[48:11] patience but that on the good ground you
[48:13] know what that is a parable of the
[48:15] Kingdom which in an honest and a great
[48:18] heart good heart having heard the word
[48:21] keep it and bring forth
[48:24] fruit with patience
[48:28] you know bring forth fruit with
[48:30] patience right you go out there and and
[48:33] you look at an apple in a certain right
[48:35] at start of the year and you look and
[48:37] there a little old
[48:38] bitty ball of a thing sticking back
[48:41] there and a bloom and then you know boy
[48:45] I got some apples well I wouldn't want
[48:47] to take them off and try to eat
[48:49] them you patiently wait right look in
[48:54] Luke 21 and9 19 he says in your
[48:59] patience now I thought we talking about
[49:02] that in add to your faith
[49:05] virtue in your patience what possess ye
[49:08] your
[49:11] souls
[49:13] patience Paul gets into Romans
[49:16] 8:25 he said but if we hope for that we
[49:20] see
[49:22] not what do we
[49:24] do
[49:26] then do we with patience wait for
[49:30] it something we don't see something
[49:32] we've asked God
[49:34] for y
[49:36] right and we're going to get down at a
[49:38] while I hope we'll understand that we'll
[49:40] get down at a while to see we're the
[49:42] ones causing the
[49:43] problems right
[49:46] amen right so go ahead to the next
[49:50] one Romans
[49:52] 15 for whatsoever things were written a
[49:55] four time were written for our
[49:58] learning now
[50:00] watching that we through
[50:05] patience and comfort of the scriptures
[50:09] might have
[50:10] hope patience to
[50:15] wait we're supposed to learn that we're
[50:18] supposed to
[50:21] wait I remember it's kind of comical but
[50:24] I remember uh brother Brady and him
[50:26] telling about you know remember they had
[50:27] the the uh they took care of a place
[50:30] there that the queen came to and the
[50:33] only one that was allowed to speak back
[50:34] to the queen was this girl that was
[50:37] actually her
[50:39] slave and she chose her clothes she
[50:41] chose
[50:42] everything you know this girl had to do
[50:45] everything and when they she'd go into a
[50:47] certain thing she had to lay out
[50:49] everything and said that Queen said
[50:52] she'd holler at her and like Mary said
[50:54] she'd say
[50:57] wait she was the only one allowed to
[50:59] talk back to her and she chose her
[51:01] clothes and things well the queen had to
[51:04] wait patiently then all right but
[51:06] look we need to learn that we through
[51:11] patience if patience we possess our soul
[51:14] then we should
[51:16] learn that patience and the comfort of
[51:19] the scriptures would bring us to a hope
[51:22] and that's a hope that needed not to be
[51:24] ashamed not just I hope
[51:26] verse five now the god of
[51:31] patience well I didn't know God had I
[51:34] didn't know he well the Bible said he's
[51:35] the god of
[51:40] patience yeah but he don't have to wait

[53:06] tribulations and
[53:08] problems which you're supposed to wait
[53:11] patiently well Lord I don't want down
[53:13] the
[53:16] tribulation
[53:18] well what did he say in 1 Timothy
[53:22] 6:11 but thou oh man of God God flee
[53:25] these things and follow after
[53:28] righteousness godliness we'll get to
[53:30] that on later this evening Faith love
[53:35] patience
[53:37] meekness he puts them all
[53:39] together right second Timothy 3:10 but
[53:43] thou Hast fully known my Doctrine now
[53:45] watch him manner of life my
[53:49] purpose my faith my longsuffering my
[53:53] charity my patience right
[53:56] amen but he put it all on what thou has
[54:00] fully known my Doctrine that's right
[54:03] amen he had a doctrine of patience we'll
[54:05] get back to it on godliness and all
[54:09] Hebrews there where it's therefore
[54:11] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[54:12] of Christ let us go into Perfection Paul
[54:15] had a doctrine of patience you think he
[54:18] didn't when he was looking at things and
[54:21] knowing what was going
[54:24] on and he was seeing the you remember
[54:27] when Paul comes along he's already
[54:28] seeing the church falling
[54:32] away he's seeing them getting
[54:35] away from the things Peter
[54:38] taught right and the apostles right Paul
[54:43] sees them as they start falling
[54:45] away and he screams out about them that
[54:48] you remember my Doctrine
[54:51] now established on the word you remember
[54:54] my man manner of Life surely he had a
[54:57] virtuous life didn't
[55:00] he my purpose my
[55:03] faith One Faith one Lord you see how you
[55:06] can take each scripture and just keep on
[55:08] and on and on on one scripture my long
[55:13] suffering sound like he had pretty good
[55:15] patience don't it my
[55:19] charity in my
[55:21] patience all go
[55:24] ahead
[55:25] Hebrews 10:36 for we have need of
[55:29] patience what that after you have done
[55:33] the will of God you might receive the
[55:36] promise now how come we don't receive
[55:38] the
[55:40] promise come on you see what I'm talking
[55:43] about you can stop on each scripture
[55:45] preach a whole sermon how come we don't
[55:46] receive the promise because we don't
[55:48] have
[55:52] patience right y we don't have
[55:56] patience wouldn't it be something to
[55:57] Abraham 25 years waiting on a Child R
[56:01] said in year he had
[56:03] patience okay come on now Hebrews 12:1
[56:07] therefore seeing we we also are
[56:10] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[56:12] witnesses now that's Heavenly Witnesses
[56:14] that's not Earthly thing what does he
[56:17] say let us lay aside ever weight and the
[56:20] sin which does so easily beset us and
[56:23] let us run with
[56:27] patience the race that is set before
[56:31] us now that can't be done in the natural
[56:34] in the natural you don't run with
[56:37] patience now the only one that runs in
[56:39] patience if is your uh long Runners
[56:42] where you got number four it takes over
[56:43] he's standing there
[56:45] waiting they're running the race and
[56:47] he's standing there waiting but when
[56:49] they get to him he ain't waiting and he
[56:52] ain't patient no more he's the guy gear
[56:55] up to run it so you can't do that but in
[56:58] the Christian realm what are we to
[57:01] do he sin that which so easy and let us
[57:04] run with
[57:06] patience the race that set let us just
[57:10] live and have patience to
[57:13] wait patience with one another we'll get
[57:16] to it in a minute patience with God
[57:19] right what about it go
[57:23] ahead and watch this
[57:26] one we all know it it's on down below
[57:29] here but we all know it we like to quote
[57:30] it tribulation worketh
[57:37] patience that's the one we get
[57:40] tribulation work with
[57:42] patience now how do how's that
[57:45] done how does tribulation work with
[57:51] patience we certainly don't line each
[57:53] other up and take a belt just start
[57:55] whipping well bud you going to get
[57:56] patience you going to get
[57:58] patience his old brother Tom used to say
[58:02] Tom father voice he said you just pump
[58:04] that guy in the nose
[58:07] Bo and he lean about he said pump him
[58:10] again Bo he said you pump him a little
[58:13] harder the next time he said he ain't
[58:15] coming back for the fourth
[58:17] time said he'll learn
[58:20] patience right you can do anything you
[58:22] want to say anything you want to but
[58:24] already got blood run out of his nose he
[58:26] ain't going to move again right that's
[58:28] not the kind right look knowing
[58:31] this that the trying of your
[58:36] faith work of the
[58:39] patience not to just to have patience
[58:42] because if something that goes on and
[58:43] somebody you
[58:48] know the trying of your faith I thought
[58:51] Faith was the bottom part of the pyramid
[58:55] trying of your
[58:57] Revelation what about
[59:00] it workers
[59:02] patience it's good for somebody to cross
[59:06] you that's right back in about 19
[59:11] 6869 there was a Doctrine called two
[59:14] souls and that was going around pretty
[59:17] heavy getting started long in there
[59:19] early '
[59:20] 70s and they were talking about two
[59:23] souls and God give you a soul the devil
[59:25] give you a soul you know well I I I
[59:28] didn't think the devil could give you
[59:30] one and I kept looking till I found
[59:32] where the Prophet said he can't so it
[59:33] was all right he he he can't create all
[59:36] right but
[59:37] still I got to thinking about
[59:42] that and you know what I began to study
[59:44] on was the soul of
[59:49] man boy I was Tried by a lot of patience
[59:52] about it
[59:53] too one brother he may listen to the
[59:56] tape he'll know that the truth of what
[59:58] it was I
[1:00:01] preached not that God had a soul but
[1:00:03] that God was a soul he said to this
[1:00:05] other brother he said brother they
[1:00:06] preaching God is a soul the brother said
[1:00:08] he's exactly right brother turned around
[1:00:10] and told me later himself he said I
[1:00:12] preach 30 or 40 sermons off of that 20
[1:00:14] 30 something like that sermons off of
[1:00:16] that when I seen
[1:00:18] it well see I to have a lot of patience
[1:00:20] trying to preach and talk about the soul
[1:00:24] and the
[1:00:25] things when everybody else was two
[1:00:32] Souls why because let patience have her
[1:00:36] perfect
[1:00:37] work that you may be perfect an entire
[1:00:40] wanting
[1:00:42] nothing James was pretty smart wasn't it
[1:00:44] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:00:46] faith work of patience you want patience
[1:00:50] let somebody try you
[1:00:53] Revelation right
[1:00:55] let them try you
[1:00:57] Revelation let them tell you you fac
[1:00:59] you're
[1:01:02] wrong let them life at you and make fun
[1:01:05] of you for
[1:01:07] believing the
[1:01:11] truth that makes you dig right am so
[1:01:16] it's not beating you up that brings
[1:01:19] patience but somebody's standing against
[1:01:21] you about what you
[1:01:23] believe right and when everybody would
[1:01:26] stand against
[1:01:29] you some of the things I preached I
[1:01:31] walked alone until some people begin to
[1:01:34] understand what I was trying to
[1:01:37] say
[1:01:39] okay going up James 5:1 behold we count
[1:01:43] them happy which
[1:01:45] endure watch you and we count them happy
[1:01:49] which have patience go to that the word
[1:01:52] enduring look you you heard of the
[1:01:55] patience of
[1:01:57] Job right you've heard how job in
[1:02:01] patience but if you watch the rest
[1:02:06] of watch it job had
[1:02:09] patience and have seen the end of the
[1:02:13] Lord now what's he
[1:02:17] saying you know that job lost his
[1:02:20] children and
[1:02:23] everything
[1:02:26] right but you know what happened in the
[1:02:29] end God gave him twofold of every animal
[1:02:32] he
[1:02:33] lost right every animal he lost because
[1:02:38] of his trying of his
[1:02:41] faith he brought patience to him in
[1:02:45] other words he set back and he
[1:02:46] said I believe God told
[1:02:50] me yeah but even his own wife said why
[1:02:52] don't you curse God and
[1:02:57] die but what was he doing you heard of
[1:03:00] the patience of Job and have seen the
[1:03:02] end of the Lord in the end of job he had
[1:03:05] double ever
[1:03:07] animal and he gave him exactly the same
[1:03:10] amount of
[1:03:11] children that he previously had now
[1:03:13] here's the words of the prophet he gave
[1:03:15] him was it seven I believe it's right
[1:03:18] okay he said he gave him the first seven
[1:03:20] in
[1:03:23] glory
[1:03:25] what all because of his
[1:03:30] patience
[1:03:32] right because of his patience to believe
[1:03:36] God
[1:03:38] Amen he WS up with double
[1:03:43] everything amen and the same amount of
[1:03:45] children giv to him in glory and he
[1:03:47] gives him seven more here well you know
[1:03:48] what that means I don't think brother
[1:03:50] randar the Bible would be saying well
[1:03:51] job got his first seven but the last
[1:03:53] seven didn't make nothing no he could
[1:03:55] apply the same thing to the last seven
[1:03:57] as he did the first seven and they would
[1:03:59] come right come on but that way you got
[1:04:02] to be
[1:04:03] patient when you apply something to your
[1:04:06] family and you see them going the
[1:04:07] opposite way that's going to make a lot
[1:04:09] of patience in you one way or the
[1:04:11] other
[1:04:13] right go ahead what do we
[1:04:15] got 13
[1:04:19] 14 Revelation says now
[1:04:23] what I think this is the second Church
[1:04:25] age or somewhere right second or third
[1:04:27] whatever it is Revelation 2 2 and 3 he
[1:04:31] said I Know Thy
[1:04:33] works and thy labor and thy
[1:04:39] patience now they were being persecuted
[1:04:41] to death by this
[1:04:43] time sure but they were having
[1:04:49] patience God said he'd take care of them
[1:04:52] he did and how that th can not buar them
[1:04:55] which are evil and thou has tried them
[1:04:56] which say they are Apostles and are not
[1:04:59] and has found them Liars so evidently uh
[1:05:02] the trying of their
[1:05:04] faith was working patience in them
[1:05:07] because they were staying with the
[1:05:10] apostles in the doctrine and calling the
[1:05:12] others Liars of course now we call them
[1:05:14] brothers right I mean nobody wants to
[1:05:17] call a preacher a liar
[1:05:19] anymore oh that's he he's got a right to
[1:05:21] believe what he want to believe yeah
[1:05:24] according to the
[1:05:25] Constitution
[1:05:27] look now what does he say and has born
[1:05:31] and has
[1:05:33] patience for what for my name's sake has
[1:05:38] labored and has not
[1:05:41] fainted even to them people there coming
[1:05:44] down Through the
[1:05:46] Ages they had
[1:05:50] patience how would you like to be in the
[1:05:52] label of the fox's book of Martyrs
[1:05:55] that's
[1:05:56] right when they were just killing them
[1:05:58] by 68 million of them killed by their
[1:06:01] own records of
[1:06:04] martyrology and you
[1:06:09] praying they take your baby out just
[1:06:11] kill it they take your wife out kill
[1:06:13] them and you
[1:06:18] praying we think about the taskmasters
[1:06:21] of
[1:06:23] Egypt
[1:06:25] and how God was trying to form patience
[1:06:27] in those
[1:06:31] people you know what they were proving
[1:06:33] their patience was right when you come
[1:06:35] down to the Dark Ages because they were
[1:06:37] giving their life for the
[1:06:39] gospel they were proven patience to be
[1:06:42] right amen the trying of their
[1:06:46] faith not just because they were being
[1:06:48] killed for what they believed no the
[1:06:51] trying of their
[1:06:53] faith
[1:06:54] you know I never have understood that
[1:06:56] I'm as honest as I can
[1:06:57] be here I am I'm telling you I believe
[1:07:01] in Jesus
[1:07:03] Christ and he died for my sins I'm
[1:07:05] trying to make a story out of it and
[1:07:08] here comes the priest
[1:07:11] down you know the Catholic priest you
[1:07:14] know and he says deny your faith that's
[1:07:18] what do you mean don't you believe Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ died for sin yes sir I believe
[1:07:22] it well what's the problem I believe it
[1:07:27] and you believe
[1:07:28] it yeah but you don't believe it the way
[1:07:30] I believe it that'd be what he'd say
[1:07:33] wouldn't it
[1:07:35] right I don't understand that folks how
[1:07:37] human beings could do
[1:07:40] that that's
[1:07:42] right but you know they came up when was
[1:07:44] a decree when the when the Holy Ghost
[1:07:46] tried to come on that uh Pope or
[1:07:48] whatever he was and he rejected it and
[1:07:51] he went and wrote the decree it was
[1:07:52] better to kill the people to make them
[1:07:54] serve God than it was to let them go on
[1:07:56] as they
[1:08:01] were we've had a lot of people run
[1:08:03] before us on a lot had we but just
[1:08:05] remember that and here's the scripture
[1:08:07] we like to wrote what we glory in
[1:08:09] Tribulation also knowing that
[1:08:11] tribulation worketh patience now you got
[1:08:14] the answer up above in James right the
[1:08:17] trying of your faith worketh patience
[1:08:21] not because tribulation is brought on
[1:08:23] you
[1:08:25] with the trying of it watch in
[1:08:30] patience it brings
[1:08:34] experience and experience brings hope am
[1:08:38] what about
[1:08:44] it what about
[1:08:49] it does our patience match up to those
[1:08:52] in the Bible
[1:08:57] okay think about it go ahead to number
[1:09:01] 16 now let's read what brother Brandon
[1:09:04] said of the Statue of a perfect man then
[1:09:06] after that fourthly you want to add
[1:09:08] patience to your faith watch if you got
[1:09:11] faith it worketh patience that's
[1:09:14] James right if you got
[1:09:18] faith it worketh
[1:09:20] patience the Bible said so this this is
[1:09:24] patience now that's the next thing is
[1:09:26] going to build this stature you know God
[1:09:30] has got real material in his building
[1:09:32] amen so see see how short we are
[1:09:36] brothers and sisters see why where we're
[1:09:39] at you see where we are at now yes
[1:09:44] sir right you see where Lula is at
[1:09:50] now come
[1:09:51] on see why where we're at yes sir see we
[1:09:56] have Glory we have shouts and things
[1:09:59] because we got
[1:10:00] faith he ain't denying a new birth on
[1:10:03] anybody right but when you come down to
[1:10:05] these things here God can't build us
[1:10:08] into that stature see he can't he can't
[1:10:12] make us up to that kind of a
[1:10:16] place now that's kind of OD is
[1:10:19] it God can't build us into that stature
[1:10:22] why
[1:10:25] wh why can't he build us to
[1:10:31] it when he acclaims that to have we have
[1:10:35] faith we have shoutings we have glories
[1:10:38] we have great things well why can't he
[1:10:39] do
[1:10:43] it something's wrong with our
[1:10:47] knowledge
[1:10:50] right our knowledge is not right
[1:10:54] we got head knowledge
[1:10:56] yeah but if we got Holy Ghost knowledg
[1:11:00] amen come
[1:11:02] on he can't make us you know God can't
[1:11:05] make you do something that you don't
[1:11:07] want to do that's right get that in your
[1:11:10] mind he cannot override your free moral
[1:11:14] agency that's right he can make you wish
[1:11:17] you
[1:11:18] did
[1:11:20] right
[1:11:21] yeah that's right well we he can't make
[1:11:24] us do it why cuz he's overriding right
[1:11:28] see he can't make us up to that kind of
[1:11:30] a place why because we won't make
[1:11:34] ourselves
[1:11:36] available that's it amen what do you
[1:11:39] mean brother I go to church I do this I
[1:11:41] believe everything pra say Amen where's
[1:11:44] your
[1:11:45] patience
[1:11:51] amen maybe that's why God does certain
[1:11:55] things to hold people to a certain
[1:11:59] way I know I've said that a lot lately
[1:12:02] I'm going to say it one more
[1:12:03] time we just finished the series on
[1:12:07] Daniel 70
[1:12:08] weeks some got a little bit
[1:12:12] flustrated when he began to talk about
[1:12:15] taking seven years off of
[1:12:19] 2026 and making it down to 2019 and
[1:12:23] we're only a couple of years from there
[1:12:25] they got
[1:12:26] scared
[1:12:28] excited you're scaring the
[1:12:33] children but what about
[1:12:38] 1974 when I preached that that we could
[1:12:41] go past that 2026 and see if we went one
[1:12:45] day past it the overlaps and the thing
[1:12:47] that's perfectly
[1:12:52] right
[1:12:54] but it's not scaring the people into
[1:12:56] coming to
[1:12:59] God it will not never
[1:13:05] will
[1:13:08] patience you say
[1:13:10] well and nobody wants to know how come I
[1:13:13] preached it that
[1:13:15] way no one has ever asked me to come to
[1:13:18] their church I've been to churches and
[1:13:20] preached but nobody has ever asked me to
[1:13:22] come to their Church and explain
[1:13:28] why don't you think it hadn't been put
[1:13:31] out the first
[1:13:33] service that I preached in in a
[1:13:35] fellowship meeting
[1:13:38] rank it was the second meeting that had
[1:13:41] had I preached the second one over
[1:13:43] brother Jimmy Gibson I preached on
[1:13:45] 1977 being the 70th
[1:13:50] jubilee don't tell me they ain't heard
[1:13:52] it
[1:13:54] no but they don't want to hear it now
[1:13:56] time's running
[1:13:59] out you think I haven't had
[1:14:02] patience but you know why I've had
[1:14:05] patience because he told me it could go
[1:14:07] that
[1:14:10] far one brother I asked him publicly
[1:14:13] what will you do in when the Rapture
[1:14:16] don't come by 77 he said I'll get out of
[1:14:18] the message then he stopped and he said
[1:14:21] no brother he said I say we
[1:14:23] misunderstood the
[1:14:26] prophet you see I didn't have no
[1:14:32] worri I don't care if it goes to the
[1:14:34] year
[1:14:35] 5000 I have no
[1:14:38] problem I ain't going to be alive but
[1:14:41] have problem I think I proved I had
[1:14:44] patience right am now watch he can't
[1:14:47] make us up to that kind of a place we
[1:14:50] got all these other things that watch
[1:14:52] him right
[1:14:53] once he man doing we got all these other
[1:14:56] things what's he saying Faith virtue
[1:15:00] knowledge we fall slide off with
[1:15:03] it why because you don't come to the
[1:15:06] temperance the
[1:15:08] patience right he can't build his church
[1:15:11] patience with what what kind of a
[1:15:13] patience first thing is have patience
[1:15:15] with
[1:15:16] God if you got real genuine faith you'll
[1:15:19] have real genuine patience because Faith
[1:15:21] worketh patience
[1:15:23] When God says anything you believe it
[1:15:26] that's all you got
[1:15:30] patience maybe some of you never
[1:15:32] experienced when God would tell you
[1:15:33] something that the way it was going to
[1:15:39] be and then you just wait brother Dale
[1:15:42] did you want the Rapture to be this late
[1:15:44] no way I was looking for it the second
[1:15:47] day after I preached it in 1974 I
[1:15:51] preached it and was looking for it that
[1:15:52] day wanting it to come that day but I
[1:15:56] proved it by the message in the Bible
[1:15:58] where we could
[1:16:00] go well we're pretty
[1:16:05] close right amen we're pretty
[1:16:09] close now watch this thing when it gets
[1:16:11] around and we start it starts falling
[1:16:12] apart on
[1:16:17] us when it starts falling apart and
[1:16:19] brother R says I gave you the quotes
[1:16:22] keep your home home belong to the
[1:16:25] Catholic
[1:16:31] church I didn't say that your Prophet
[1:16:35] said
[1:16:36] that Bo it's going to go haywire when
[1:16:38] things starts falling apart but listen
[1:16:41] at least you ought to be scheduled
[1:16:43] enough to
[1:16:46] know and know these things are going to
[1:16:49] take place why because God said it would
[1:16:53] good right
[1:16:55] amen that's it right patience right when
[1:16:59] God says anything we believe it that's
[1:17:01] all we got
[1:17:05] patience yeah when he told me Wade was
[1:17:07] going to come back to the Lord many many
[1:17:09] years later I had to have
[1:17:12] patience but see he's always wonderful
[1:17:14] in what he
[1:17:15] does you just have patience with him and
[1:17:18] let it happen and see go right in the
[1:17:20] middle of that and he comes back to the
[1:17:22] Lord and you shouting Glory
[1:17:24] Hallelujah and God adds some more and he
[1:17:26] says he's going to stand in the pull pit
[1:17:28] with you and preach with you he always
[1:17:30] gives you
[1:17:32] extra if you just have patience okay I
[1:17:36] know your patience is weering out there
[1:17:39] what say I asked him last night to heal
[1:17:42] me now I listen to the prophet right and
[1:17:45] I'm just as sick this morning oh what
[1:17:51] patience right
[1:17:55] God told Abraham and 25 years later
[1:17:58] there wasn't even one sign he was still
[1:18:00] believing he was patient with God that's
[1:18:06] right but yet we're prayed for and don't
[1:18:09] immediately get
[1:18:16] it what about God trying our patience
[1:18:19] what about the Bible where he sends
[1:18:21] things among us and great signs and
[1:18:23] wonders happen he said but if they take
[1:18:25] you to another God don't believe it he's
[1:18:27] trying you to see the prophet said to
[1:18:29] see whether or not you'll stay with the
[1:18:30] word he said he's trying to prove I
[1:18:33] believe it's God of this evil age he
[1:18:35] said he would prove that this bride in
[1:18:37] the end time would not fall like
[1:18:40] Eve what about
[1:18:43] it what about
[1:18:45] it God tries your
[1:18:49] patience go down to 16 let's jump to
[1:18:51] that one okay Noah had patience we're
[1:18:54] coming down you know he said Noah had
[1:18:56] plenty of patience 120 years now you
[1:18:59] ever thought about he went 120 years
[1:19:01] saying it's going to
[1:19:02] rain now you you got something you
[1:19:05] better
[1:19:07] consider God told Noah to get in the ark
[1:19:09] it going to rain in seven
[1:19:11] days it did not rain in seven days check
[1:19:15] your
[1:19:19] Bible he told him it rain 7even days
[1:19:22] check your
[1:19:25] see if it rain the seventh
[1:19:31] day you remember the
[1:19:33] story Noah's family come up to him
[1:19:37] daddy he said God told
[1:19:40] me yeah but he told you to say seven
[1:19:44] days and it ain't come he said that
[1:19:47] don't change me
[1:19:50] right read your Bible
[1:19:53] right see God tries our
[1:19:56] patience you remember what he said about
[1:19:58] Moses one time I don't know where it's
[1:20:00] in this one not but he said God wanted
[1:20:02] to make sure he had the right man when
[1:20:03] he got down to the Red Sea he didn't
[1:20:05] want no problem he said so he put Moses
[1:20:07] through a lot of
[1:20:09] trouble you mean God wanted to make sure
[1:20:12] no God wasn't want to make sure God
[1:20:14] wanted Moses to come to the place that
[1:20:16] he got out of all of his stuff and had
[1:20:19] patience right
[1:20:21] listen see 120 years then God tries your
[1:20:25] patience God tries them after he told
[1:20:28] Noah I said Noah I want you to go ahead
[1:20:30] and get in the heart I'm going to
[1:20:33] rain I'm going to run you to go ahead go
[1:20:37] ahead and get I'm going to run you the
[1:20:39] animals and all in there and I want you
[1:20:41] to get in climb up upstairs now what's
[1:20:43] he doing I want you to get up in there I
[1:20:45] want you to tell them people
[1:20:48] tomorrow what I've been preaching for
[1:20:51] 120 years is going to take place all
[1:20:54] right you go down there and tell them it
[1:20:56] didn't
[1:20:58] rain read your
[1:21:04] Bible God knows how to try our patience
[1:21:07] well that makes God that don't make God
[1:21:08] a
[1:21:12] liar he just told him seven
[1:21:15] days the rest of it's
[1:21:18] eternity right don't worry about it what
[1:21:21] was the first sign know I got now roll
[1:21:23] it on up got plenty the next day I
[1:21:25] believe he might have told his family
[1:21:26] and all you know he could look out and
[1:21:28] they'd see it and all he said well one
[1:21:31] day next day he turned around it didn't
[1:21:33] happen next day keep on rolling it up
[1:21:36] some Highway Believers come around and
[1:21:38] on and KN one instead of the black cloud
[1:21:39] here come the Sun the next day hey there
[1:21:42] ain't no Cloud that guy come up ah I
[1:21:45] know you was one of them he but Noah he
[1:21:48] had patience
[1:21:50] said if it don't come today
[1:21:53] he'll be here
[1:21:54] tomorrow why God said
[1:22:00] so when did he tell you that Noah 120
[1:22:07] years now listen I've got to explain
[1:22:10] something here so I have to run F so
[1:22:12] listen now brother around uses Noah he
[1:22:15] uses the Hebrew children he uses Moses
[1:22:18] he uses all of them and says they have
[1:22:21] patience
[1:22:25] and on the message he's preaching that
[1:22:27] we have to have
[1:22:29] patience with our new
[1:22:32] birth
[1:22:34] working so don't get all excited about
[1:22:37] it and say well boy he didn't get that
[1:22:38] right well you you tell us we got to get
[1:22:41] born again then have patience and said
[1:22:43] Noah had patience got the quote Moses
[1:22:45] had patience got the quote Hebrew
[1:22:46] children had
[1:22:48] qu they didn't have Holy Ghost Born
[1:22:51] Again experience of
[1:22:54] patience they had patience right more
[1:22:58] than just a human mortal of patience but
[1:23:00] not Holy Ghost Born Again experience
[1:23:03] patience is that
[1:23:05] enough well I still think he said Moses
[1:23:08] had it and Moses that I've got it
[1:23:10] okay let's see you have the patience of
[1:23:14] Moses well well let's see you have the

[1:24:30] of the people of this message would go

[1:28:48] if you ain't got it don't try to build
[1:28:49] on this down here have patience you
[1:28:51] remember that's the only thing I've ever
[1:28:52] told you he told me I said Lord where am
[1:28:54] I at he said if you'll have patience
[1:28:56] with the people it'll prove you got
[1:28:58] patience so that's all I've ever said
[1:28:59] and that's all I ever care about he
[1:29:01] throw himself in the breach and said God
[1:29:03] don't do it patience with the people God
[1:29:06] was going to destroy him that's Moses
[1:29:07] right first we got to have to where that
[1:29:10] they baniz together if you don't come to
[1:29:13] that stature of the dwelling place of
[1:29:14] the Living God if you haven't got
[1:29:16] patience patience and one another all
[1:29:18] right Hebrew children had
[1:29:20] patience God had
[1:29:23] patience God had promised
[1:29:26] them don't you bow down to any image
[1:29:28] they had patience patience knowing this
[1:29:31] that God will raise him up in the last
[1:29:34] days what are we worrying about it
[1:29:36] Daniel had
[1:29:38] patience so got patience wait Paul had
[1:29:42] patience patience certainly look what
[1:29:45] Paul had to do talk about your patience
[1:29:48] how about your Pentecostal
[1:29:50] people as long long as they got the
[1:29:52] commission they talking about the day of
[1:29:54] Pentecost watch it wait until wait until
[1:29:57] you're endued with power how long they
[1:29:59] didn't have no question how long will it
[1:30:02] be they just got the answer
[1:30:06] wait
[1:30:08] right then he comes on down what promis
[1:30:11] they waited nine days then the 10th day
[1:30:14] we were there they had patience with God
[1:30:17] now if you got that kind of patience
[1:30:18] after God gives you a promise and you
[1:30:21] see it in the Bible it's mine then
[1:30:25] wait if then if you've got that kind of
[1:30:30] patience add it to your faith and see
[1:30:33] how far you're getting now you're
[1:30:35] getting way up here now all right clock
[1:30:37] hand doing it too what about having
[1:30:39] patience can you wait for your
[1:30:42] family can you claim them yes I don't
[1:30:46] mind saying it because he told me God
[1:30:48] told me years ago in the scripture he
[1:30:50] says you'll be there with your offspring
[1:30:53] the F of my kids grandkids great
[1:30:55] grandkids what get away from God the
[1:30:57] more I know the promise is true he's
[1:30:59] going to bring
[1:31:00] them but it's their choice they're going
[1:31:03] to make the choice because it's not
[1:31:04] automatic because Daddy's this he's
[1:31:06] going to bring it but he said you'll be
[1:31:08] there with your Offspring you said with
[1:31:10] every one of them well why would I not
[1:31:12] believe every one of
[1:31:14] them why would you not believe every one
[1:31:17] of them well I can believe the on living
[1:31:19] T not Oh Glory that's real good
[1:31:24] good all
[1:31:26] right it was God made a go promise and
[1:31:29] God will keep the prise have patience
[1:31:30] you've got patience if not you're
[1:31:33] crumbling now look you have patience if
[1:31:37] you got patient if not you're crumbling
[1:31:40] so you realize what he's saying
[1:31:44] okay Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:31:48] now
[1:31:50] patience
[1:31:53] but if that patience is not
[1:31:55] correct what's going to
[1:32:01] crumble come on I didn't say
[1:32:04] it he said you're crumbling off of this
[1:32:07] building here and knock all the rest of
[1:32:10] it down
[1:32:16] right I thought I had all this I thought
[1:32:18] I I didn't
[1:32:20] need
[1:32:22] I didn't write the book folks I'm sorry
[1:32:25] and knock all the rest of it down that
[1:32:27] one thing got to have that don't add it
[1:32:31] because it'll wreck your building if you
[1:32:33] haven't got patience if you hadn't got
[1:32:35] virtue to add to your faith that you say
[1:32:37] you got and if you haven't got any faith
[1:32:39] and try to put virtue on it it'll break
[1:32:41] your faith
[1:32:42] down see you say well now wait a minute
[1:32:47] maybe this is all a mistake anyhow maybe
[1:32:49] God isn't going to there's no God
[1:32:52] it'll break it how far are we
[1:32:58] down watch what he says on why I'm
[1:33:00] against organized religion that's the
[1:33:02] way God does his church he beats every
[1:33:04] Creed every denomination every man Dogma
[1:33:06] until he sees his own life reflecting in
[1:33:09] you now right beats it out of

[1:35:57] birth I've been birthed into this and
[1:36:00] this and this and this and this there's
[1:36:02] not seven New Birth a birth means a
