body of christ but we do say welcome to you for your your first time here you get a good welcome so just make yourself at home the lord would bless you and be with you be uh maybe a little crowded this morning that's that's good just sit a little closer together and make it closer fellowship we had a real good time at the fellowship meeting over in uh six flags there brother tony's yesterday and uh brother gerald hughes was our priest of goodness and we had a good time doing that amen you'll remember that now i want to make a an announcement that we'll make a couple of times and uh i hope you understand what i'm saying about it but our christmas time will be together on december the 9th and we always have that we have a dinner together everybody fixes and brings but we've had so much trouble trying to get the gifts that we give you to you until we've decided to make a new ruling to starting this year and from this year on it will be the ruling of this you've got to be present to get a gift all right and most of you know that it is a monetary gift that the church gives to you and appreciation and also we try to honor and appreciate all of our officers teachers you know musicians song leaders and thing and we try to give everybody and this year is going to cost us a pretty good bit because we started the thing years ago trying to give everybody in the offices a silver dollar well we started out when they were like two or three dollars a piece now they're 40 bucks you know and there's about 33 officers or offices in the church so you can calculate that it's going to be a pretty good little bit but that's not even the other part but you're going to have to be present to receive it and this is for the top players of the church not for somebody walking off the street and everything this is for the top players of the church you know and your immediate family that's under your household with your coming for the kids and things but now who is not here you know if you're not here your money will be placed in the missionary offering okay so you won't be losing you you're not here we try to come together to honor all the officers and offices and the people who help us here even down to the janitors and everything because we appreciate you you know because it's you and we appreciate also the the people coming to the church here so just remember that now if you're not present on that date your money will be put into a missionary fund to be given to the missionaries when they come by in the things but you must be present to win and you must be a top player and you know counting this your church home because that's what we can't we can't do the whole world you know but we can do a little bit in everything to help so i hope that's understood now and it will be announced um you know two or three more times until that time to do it okay all right if you got your scripture revelations 1 and revelation 6 and let's see this afternoon will be the communion and this coming saturday did we move the what did we do the next one will be kimbo get married yeah all right okay we got it because we had to change the bible study for a few weekends and different things so hard for me to keep up with all right revelations 1 and revelation 6. the heavenly father we thank you for all things thank you most of all for being you and we pray that you would just help us today that you'd come among us here could we gather for one purpose and that is to fellowship together around thy word and we pray that you would just have your way with each and every one of us should forgive our sins mostly and as you let your light shine in our hearts as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and our lives forgive our sins keep us because that's our desire in jesus name amen okay we've been in a study on the book of revelations for quite a while so we always read revelations 1 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show and to his servants things which must shortly come to vice and he sinned and signified it by his angel and to his servant john to bear record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy you keep those things which are written therein what or the time is at hand what it should be the time to understand right right the time is at hand right now revelations 6 verse 12 and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloths of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree catches her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it had rolled together never mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and ever freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the rocks of the mountains and set under the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that set up on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand and be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i know most of the most of the people back here are relation to brother bob and sister monica and we appreciate you coming being with us today and just make yourself to home if we say something you don't agree with just pray for us that's the best thing to do you know and then later come and sit down in the office and talk with me i'll be glad to to discuss whatever with you of what i've tried to say because we want to be right in the end time this is not a time to play around this is the time to understand as i said we've been in a study to the strangers today we've been in a study now for this is 48 messages on the study on the book of revelations we've gotten up to the sixth seal and we just kind of covered a little bit along in there of the things that uh appears to us and sticks out to be covered not trying to re-preach them i did that in the in the years gone by in the 80s two and three and uh you know but to just pick up some thoughts and try to uh see what the lord is revealing to us in this day and where we're at because i believe that the message unfolds right i believe it it's the word progressive is a is a bad word i don't really think brother brown ever used the word progressive but we speak of progressive revelation and form of saying that it's unfolding but i like the word unfolding because you know uh irregardless i would think that if you're a believer in this message that you would agree with this statement that today the message has unfolded into greater depths than you know it was when we first began right and in that we don't look for another message nor a messenger to come to try to carry us on i believe rapture and faith lays in the books and the tapes the prophet's message i know and they're arguing around the country now about this that or the other brother around this away i believe brother adam was a human being all right and i believe he made human mistakes but the message is perfect amen i believe the message is perfect now i will not back down anywhere from that and i ask you to come and show me where the message is not perfect the message you say but now wait a minute you didn't mention there's one you got to be real careful there because you just made him deity right you didn't realize you've done that but that's what you've done see the messenger was a man a human being that was chosen of god to bring the message right he made human mistakes slips of the tongues and things like that because he was a human but yet the message he brought is perfect complete doesn't need anybody else doesn't need anybody to uh come along and tell you what he should have said right it just needs us to believe what he's saying right and that way then that's showing you where i stand in the whole line because uh it's like we're talking about what was the thing that we covered in the fifth seal on uh trying to get a better understanding there is no combat beast on the fifth seal do you have combat beasts for the first seal second seal third and fourth seal but on the fifth sixth and seventh there's not a combat beast all right the prophet said that's a great mystery it's a great understanding now i do not believe that the combat could break the seals right there was a lamb that broke the ceiling and then handed it to the combat beast and then the combat beast could announce so he's the announcer he's not the revealer even brother right i'm quoting said that jesus said my own life did not reveal that unto thee the father is the only revealer of the word see so then we don't put the emphasis upon the the messenger revealing the word we put the emphasis upon the lamb to break the seal and to reveal but then the announcing or the bringing to you and i we have to put that emphasis upon the prophet to come the because that would be you know that was promised in the word and i know it's elementary that we'll do this morning but uh you know i want you to think with me and just to see a point because there is no combat beast on this sixth seal right all right see because you don't need one there's two reasons for not needing one number one is the fourth combat beast was an eagle so you don't need anything after them that was god's prophet to bring us the message you agree that was where was to come so you don't need another one right we don't need somebody to come along and straighten this one out either no right you know we need to believe what he said and sometimes have to wait patiently until god will reveal what is being said i've studied on things for 20 years before i ever preach on it well because i didn't see it right that's the reason i didn't preach it no problem with that is it you know if i didn't understand it took me 16 years to learn to ride a bicycle i'm not joking but you know i can do it today because the immense burn together in your brain and then you won't forget might not be as good balance as i had but just a point to get you to think about see we need the revelation the prophet of god said we need revelation more than anything right amen but it's only by revelation do we have the word revealed i believe in the letter of the word but i believe the letter of the word the prophet said can be questioned is that true he said while it's laying here it can be questioned right but once it's revealed you can't be questioned that's right amen there was a day-man question about the joshua of faith he wondered about it he wondered whether his good deeds was it some people are special something you were but you know god revealed to a man one day the joy shall live by faith martin luther struck the world with a revelation don't tell him how many times he had preached on justification in his life but yet one day it was revealed that's what i'm talking about see this message then must be revealed not to just read the letter because paul said to let her kill it but the spirit giveth life now i hope with that you understand where i stand because we believe this message to be the last message to the gentiles all right and in being that then we must take what he says and like i said sometimes things that he'll say sounds a little contrary but i've never found it yet to be but if you give it a little time that's right and wait a little while and study a little while that it won't come out to give an understanding you know and i do not agree with the doctrine that says before the seals he didn't understand what he was doing but after the seal was broke he come into the great revelation i i know he came into the great revelation but he was a prophet amen all right you go back and show me where he missed it other than the white horse rider he said well he said this he said that yeah but just keep on reading i said a lot of things on reading that's my point but just get the point now there's no combat beast to announce this sixth seal because the fourth combat beast was the eagle all right the prophet the messenger all right now i know i've told you this and this is the way i believe it we take the first combat beast to be the the lion the next the hawks the man then the eagles and we say well the lion was you know was in all of the people we'll say the ox within all of the people will say that the man was in all of the people no luther wesley and all of those great men but when we come down to the end we say blood brown i agree he was the eagle but i thought he said we was to be little messiahs children of god we'll get into a point this morning and you know if you don't agree with it like i said fine just pray for us but i try to prove my point and then by moving on through to the message we can see you know more of it now we went through it and said the seals and what's the mystery in a minute where you know what brother brown said that that line didn't understand you could bring the last day message from the line the ox they had their time they said you had to wait till the eagle came that's not discrediting any of those is it right let's just tell it like it is it's the word of god all right now so get my point now the light the the lamb opens the seal because the bible says it and then the combat beast is the voice to announce or to proclaim what is said there and you know that's exactly the scriptural point that we believe right and you know like i said i wrote these notes down three or four days ago so you know you'll see that i'm just trying to follow a line up but go ahead and look at what we believe we believe in malachi 4. amen right we believe in an end-time prophet coming of malachi 4. all right and in doing that we know for a certainty that the word of god is true we know that it all points down to the end time but then he gets in verse 5 and says behold i send you elijah the prophet before they come in the great and dreadful day of the lord i like that i like that little word you you know that's me you remember sister meaty's when she asked about marrying brother brown behold i send you she wasn't worried about how many elijahs they were she wasn't concerned about all these coats of elijah's and all these people that claimed to be elijah she married one man and that was the one she wanted because it was sent to her all right now but behold i send you elijah the prophet before they come to the great and dreadful day of the lord and what will they do and they shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children now notice the point and he shall turn the heart it didn't say hearts there's only one heart to be turned man and that heart is the word translated soul correctly so translate the word into our soul co soul is what we've been talking about as the being of who you are your body will go to the grave if you die your spirit will go somewhere to god or whatever as the scripture said would go to god and gave it but your soul will live on so the soul of you is the real part of you it's your being it could be the word heart is translated soul because it's not the thumping gizzard you know the thing that pumps the blood it's not that heart right it's the heart of you the heart of a peach is the seed contained in that and it may not be in the middle right you know what i mean by peach or about an apple or whatever it's in the seed of that all right so the heart of man not hearts one heart is going to be turned what to the what heart of the fathers to the children luke 1 17 said john the baptist came to do that right do we know that he was the the third coming of elijah and he was to turn the hearts of the children you know the fathers to the children the old testament saints was to be turned to right jesus christ all right that was john's message all right but now we know that there's something else to happen because and is a conjunction meaning something is going to take place and the heart of their children to their fathers now i've talked with people and i'm sure you have and they said well john the baptist turned it we'll agree with that luke 1 17 they're going out of a verse or two and he said in the children of the disobedience of different things and they'll say see john turned him over this way it turned him back well the easiest thing to say to me is you don't realize what you just done because if john turned them to the message and then he turned them back he'd put him back under the law and see that wouldn't be correct right so then there has to be an end time to come into work that what in this end time we are to be turned back as we would call it to the faith of the fathers the revelation of the fathers lest he would come and smite the earth with a curse and we see a lot of that going on today i hope you you read the newspapers you can see a lot of things that's going on that we're under a pre-tribulation there's a prophet with cover not the great tribulation as we'll get into the sixth seal we're under a pre-tribulation of where things are taking place and you know what i love about the bible it is specific right when the bible would say that and seven thousand men died in an earthquake or something like that just a scripture what do you think well you know there's 200 000 killed over in that last one you know and why wouldn't they say 200 000 because the bible and god is specific when he says there'll be seven thousand killed there's not seven thousand in one or neither is a six thousand nine hundred and ninety nine see he's making his point and that way you can take it and narrow it down and find that exact existence and say thank you we got it i mean it's like he said about the brother branham is it that you got your problem out here with man and all of that he said that's not necessarily just the sign of the end he said because they've always done that but when you put it all together and you come out to a place then you can see that we must be turned back to the revelation of the father the faith they had and and in turning back to that faith then we wouldn't be confused right all right we'd be standing in the scriptures that's why when brother random went beyond the curtain of time you remember what he said they said jesus will come to you and you'll be judged he said well i'll be judged in other words what i preach said will paul and peter and them be judged and the angel said yes he said well then i preached what they preached so in other words they make it i'm going to make it right that was his point i preach what they preach so then why would anybody come alone just saying a moment ago and said brother around was all confused in his early ministry and then the son of man finally comes straight in him out when you see those doctrine just keep watching the guy that's right the guy's gonna ride off somewhere and he's gonna get tied up with women he's gonna get tied up with garbage cans so let him run their course with you an hour to stay with the word all right look at the next one we talk about luke 17 30. in the day when the son of man would be revealed well there was no one down through time he even hardly spoke of son of man amen you go back in your writers and read it here comes a man little kentuckian out with about a seventh grade education and your scholars that are sitting there and none of their fancy writers dealt with son of man because you know i know some did to a degree but i mean as a basics they didn't follow son of man because they could barely understand the son of god so they didn't deal with son of man but here comes a prophet along any little kentucky language we start talking about son of man son of man and he deals with it all the way through his ministry and any climax has been talking about that jesus when he was here on earth that he never declared himself to be the son of god he declared himself to be the son of man now we know he did in the basis of discussing it with him and different things like we always say i try to be you know corrective not of brother around him but mine in your language an understanding but around said jesus never called mary his mother you remember that now there's no correction to the point but now when he was a little baby you know a six-month-old baby a eight-month-old baby he started saying mama yeah come on let's be human sensible the prophet is not saying that he never done it like that he's saying he never called her his earthly productor producer or bring her forth you know you would call her a woman because it just borrowed the wound to be borned in all right that way is not corrective that's understanding that should be progressing in us to where we can understand but see jesus he he would say who do the man say i the son of man now peter said the art the christ the son of the living god now immediately what would you say if you were saying like jesus was saying that who do man say i the son of man well i would probably correct him when you i would say hey look would you mind listening to what i'm saying i'm asking you the question the who does men say i the son of man i am but see instead of doing that what did jesus do he said upon this rock i'll build my church peter had it right about the son of god and jesus said i'll build my church all right run around what did he say he said he was dying son of man ray son of god down through seven church ages the son of god to appear in the end time again as son of man but not the lord jesus christ coming back in a corporal body you know immortal right but then he would come back in a prophet and have that same ministry in elijah that was promised to come in the end time the forthcoming of the the of elijah right this promised all right and in doing that he would bring forth the son of man because see son of man was dealing with god in human flesh and he was really dealing with the resurrection sign that's why they couldn't understand son of man when jesus constantly went through son of man son of man son of man but even the great apostle paul never even mentioned son of man none of you writers of peter james john now john does in his john writing because he's writing what jesus said but even after going to patmos and coming back and that no one in there mentioned son of man because that was to be with withholden according to luke 17 30 in the day when the son of man would be revealed made known see here comes the prophet talking sort of man some name they're wondering what's this man talking about but then he began to do the discernments the things that the prophet the lord jesus christ had upon the earth he comes back with the same anointing style looking until they actually called him god and i'm not throwing off on them because if you lived around a guy you know day in and day out and every time he turned around like who was it trump uh one of the men said you know the man can tell you where a fish is at you know i mean if you went that way every day in and out with it you would have a lot of thinking about it but yet you got to define between the man and the god that was using the man so is that as god would use the man he said i'm nothing awaiting him but then all of the great signs that followed the lord jesus christ appears in this little man in the end time but there was one thing that was needful and that was why the son of man would have to deal with it as i said the son of man would be dealing with the word made flesh you agree with that statement i mean you don't have to agree with me i don't ask nobody to agree with i've always told you i don't ask my wife my kids are all here i don't ask them to agree with i ask them to check out what is being said right amen and then deceive if the spirit of god within them agrees with the word but he would come forth in the son of man because it was something about the son of man that was left off during as i said that times of understanding and i won't get into it today but we will get into it eventually you know that when you get old about matthew 24 you find this son of man the lord jesus christ you know what he'd done we didn't know it because we had no idea no writers knew of it but he preached six seals right you that have been in the seal book you know what i'm talking about right jesus preached six seals the prophet took him and overlaid him and compared him see because he was the son of man amen and the son of man would deal with a bodily form it would have to be a a special point the brother said in body he was a man he said the spirit he was god said but in soul he was almighty god that was god made manifest right in the flesh right that wasn't a moral human being as some are teaching now the river jordan doctrines that they're teaching that jesus wasn't god until the river jordan then he finally become god well who was he before he could become god my bible said he was born lord to christ that's scripture all right i know that he was anointed on the river jordan to bring forth the ministry yes i know the prophet had to come to that position too to be anointed to bring those things or the seals and things but that doesn't mean he wasn't god that's right he was almighty god made manifest in human flesh the body was a man yes hebrews 10 5 a body thou hast prepared me but in spirit and soul that was almighty god amen or else you got a second person that's right amen we know and deal with the fact that we know the second person won't matter but this man would be the word made flesh the son of man that's right and if he would be the son of man then no one would be able to understand him right but one day and he knew that he knew as it said a moment ago he knew he had to give his life he would have to come back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost into the hearts of the saints on the day of pentecost and in doing that then they would have the ability to comprehend jesus would make the statement of like you don't understand what's going on i said one day you will that's right well then the odds that brought around gets over about the sixth seal and he makes an outstanding statement he said it's gone from you he said there's no way for you to understand is that all that jesus would speak that way that jesus would know the people was not understanding him he said i have to go away and get my life and come back and then you'll understand right after life's finally you know they get in close enough to it and he said do you finally believe have it have you finally got to the place you can believe what i'm doing because see in the end time we would have a man to come back to that ministry without to repeat and he would be able to stand here and declare the secrets of the hearts the different things that jesus would do that then he would preach the seals same as matthew 24 and bring it down that's no coincidence i hope you would not think that and in doing that then the son of man would stand there and not only would he have all the gifts and the signs and the wonders that the dead would be raised the sick would be healed but yet he would declare the opening of the seals all right now move a little further with that if you will then that would mean that john was right when he was standing on the edge of the thing baptizing people and when jesus walked up what did he say he didn't say hey here comes god no what did he say behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world see then watch when you get over into the opening of the seals why would you want to change from it being the same lamb that would open the seals it was the same lamb that spoke of them what would be any problem see that way you would not be looking to mankind you would be looking to god amen and as the prophet said about if god requires perfection that he's got to make a way and says he has by himself coming and living in you and i that's all right see he has to make a way so we have to make a way for us to understand so it would be left with us as to as a prophet would say it would not be left for us to just read the bible right that's well and good it would not be left all of the commentaries all the writings all of the new scriptures writings and the things to come along it wouldn't be left upon that for him to end this world it would be left upon the fact of whether or not he kept his word from malachi 4 and would send us elijah the prophet and then it would come forth then that this elijah the prophet would be able to stand on earth and all of the gifts and the signs and the wonders that followed the ministry of jesus christ but really the only difference you have between the lord jesus christ is brother random is the bodily now you need that quote the bodily form is the difference because that bodily form was born from a mama and a daddy and was an earthly possession and a soul of an individual had to be born again you'd say well i don't know about that well he's the one that said he wasn't arguing with you he said it all right now so that made the difference between the two but as far as the ministry everything is identical because the lord jesus preached six seals right he'd have to preach himself because he wasn't you know if you followed that later on you didn't have to preach it because he was it he said a seven seal can't be it's a great secret but right around and said it can be ready now but see then we go over to another favorite scripture this is called revelations 10. we'll go ahead and pull that brother i'm just using these because maybe there's some among us today that doesn't understand these things and then especially out on the internet system where it's going there's a lot of people out there that don't understand maybe somebody click on today and see malachite four look seventy thirty revelations themselves first time they ever seen it say well that guy's got something i'm really checking today you know so we try to be for everybody but still i'm trying to be for everybody sometimes i'll find out a lot of things that i didn't know and it unfolds right until where we can see so look what it says in revelations 10 we're very familiar with the writing we can go through a lot of things and explaining all of it like brother brown was the one that said in verse one the mighty angel come down from heaven close the cloud and the rainbow was on his head and faced with your son his fever covered fire he said that's the same as revelation 1 13 right i didn't say that he did revelation 1 13 is one locker right in there 13 14 one like unto the son of man it doesn't say in revelation that he's the son of man there chapter one it says one like that's bride form your prophet said because it's standing there with pouts feminish so you better get to realize where we're at amen because there's always got to be a message we'll get to it in a minute man but there's always got to be a people to receive that message if you didn't receive the message in the days of martin luther then you would be judged upon the basis of martin luther's message that's right when sanctification came forth with john wesley if you didn't proceed on the end of that and received the new birth of that age you would be judged right right right we have to follow it for the hour that we're in and go on with it all right let's go down to where we always get to verse 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants to prophets now if we're going to believe that has to be in connection with the elijah of the end time you know not he wasn't the person of elijah he was in the paris john was not the person of elijah he was in the spirit the power of elijah right or elijah calls us elijah right so it would be the spirit in the man all right but if we're going to believe that then there must be some connection to word that we can keep it within our understanding to see then if we believe as we'll get to in a second that this fourth combat beast would be the eagle be elijah do you think we've got to get that back to the seventh church age all right that's why your prophet was so perfect he said the bride goes up in revelation 4 1 and not seen until 1921. right see then we go over to revelation 10 and we say but but what about this he then comes to a carnal mind of understanding right well the book of revelations is not in order it should be here it should be here not about if it needed to bend that the prophet would have told that's right right now do you know of any word that he told us it wasn't in order but i believe by memory i can quote a few things where he said even the the ends and the butts is in the correct place so we don't need to move around the bible you know pull this over here put that over here this would have been here well why didn't the prophet tell us that was what it was supposed to do he has plenty of time but he emphatically stated the bride goes up not seen until revelation 19 then goes hayward what about revelation 5 brother now what about revelation 5 that's in heaven come on that's where your prophet said it was that he didn't say the bride wouldn't be seen the bride ain't seen on earth anymore revelation 4 1 to 19 21 but she's seen in heaven amen amen are we right you seen in heaven but not on earth he said 4 to 19 is jewish all right see then what are you gonna do with it with the great understanding that we try to proclaim from revelation 10 7. and then somebody picks up a book from the prophet and they read it and they say well he said here that drive goes up for one and not come back in 1921 so that can't be elijah come on they got a point right that's wrong they just trapped you whether you know it or not you're standing there with your mouth because they just exposed you but you see when you know the truth okay john what was you told to do let's go over there and then we'll come back to this okay bro let's go to revelation 1 then we'll come back to seven john what was you told to do saying i'm not going to make it the first in the last one god says write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia john was commanded to write these things and send it back to the church not just write one or two chapters but from chapter one as we would begin to see until chapter 21 john was commanded to write it and send it back or send it to those seven ages the churches are named samaritan's pergamos tower of philadelphia sardis ladies don't you imagine john was getting confused a little bit when he got over there to 10-7 and he talked about an angel standing on earth and he would talk about seven thunders under their voice now what would you do what would you do if you were commanded to write a letter to seven churches you know and tell them what you saw well i just write down what i saw i saw this i saw that i saw this i saw that that's what john done right you agree yes he wrote it exactly as he was told to write it go back up 10 70. there's always been a key there to me that really always helped me is why would john lee be time no longer why would he put that little word but what did you just say in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and then you would have had mass confusion because you'd had all these guys running around to be an all kind of elijah i'm this i'm there but remember john has done come through the church ages he knows there's only seven ages and whether you know it or not i'm quoting brother branham almost verbatim you that know the message you don't have to agree that's right so here comes the man that says well we'll write in this seventh church age would be the life's age and there he would start off and he would say the beginning of the creation of god and loving it so much here with a prophet come along and say he was the beginning of the creation and he said we're the rest of that creation i love that don't you amen that's right puts us in there because like i've always tried to tell you if you want to find yourself in the bible once you go to the book of revelation the book that we was told to stay away from right is a book written to and about the bride amen i ask you to come and show me any place in the book of revelation where jesus christ is shown by himself you quiet don't you i'm just asking you because i've studied over 40 something years and i've never found yet where jesus was there by himself the book of revelations is the bride's book the book we was told to be scared of why because that would be the devil trying to pervert us and turn us away that when the prophet would come and tell us the symbols yes then we can understand read revelations one and read what your prophet has to say one standing in the midst of the seven golden candlestick lock unto the son of man gerd about to pout for the golden girdle brother brown said he turned to see the voice and saw the bride well i believe it's why we're not a denomination but i'll give it to you out of service for your church but listen a little word button there's a very key word john is commissioned to write so he's writing but yet he begins to realize that i've advanced further over in and i'm talking of things that will happen after the church is gone you agreed a moment ago the prophet was right when he said we go up revelation 4 1 and not single 1921. so john he said well what can i do i'm writing of things now that's going to take place after the rapture he says how can i do it lord and all that wants a key thing come into his mind your prophet said it it was necessary that the seventh church aids messenger be a prophet you agree with that statement right you don't you know i'll be glad to give it to you because i quote brother you believe it will come off of the computer you're not having any trouble with it because you have to realize it man he realizes it's the seventh church ace messenger would have to be a prophet because he would end up all things to the gentile dispensation and he would be able to tell us things to come after the dispensation over into the jews and the millennium and armageddons and all of the things and even to the future home what about a message we've received that goes all the way to tell us what the future home looks like but think john thinks how can i get this back to the church agency and then it strikes him and he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mysteries of god would be revealed to the seventh church age messenger right right the prophet of malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7. so the key is that little work but john sees then hey that messenger back there all i got to do is make sure i record it correctly he said one day almost a 2000 year period by the time he was writing to work coming back but said one day luke 17 30 will come again a prophet will come in the end time that all of these mysteries can be revealed [Music] so he automatically looks back and sees the seven church age messenger as a prophet he just keeps on writing he said now i know how to get it back there i just record it and when i do in the days of the voice of the seventh angel remember he was commissioned to write it to the church knowing that if he wrote it down and realizing the seventh angel the messenger of the seventh church age that way your prophet explained it would be a prophet that the word of god could come true and all the mysteries could be revealed so he knew something was right then see this book that we're looking at could not be opened then until the seventh church age would come you agree with it this book was sealed daniel said it was the book of revelation said it was see it was seven seals and all this happening but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the messenger of the seventh church age all the mysteries would be revealed okay agree that he was a prophet had to be that for the word of god to come to all right but just remember this you would also be left for the last days watch it in a minute we'll give the quote right around said there's a people a prophet in other words one to receive it to give it but there's got to be a people to receive it what's the use of bread around them coming if there's not a bribe if there's not a bride to receive what has been said why would the prophet say that's right that's where everybody says you'll stay away from the seals you don't understand why the prophet he told us what it was any problem you want to know what the first is he tells you he tells you the symbols right right a white horse rider next was a red horse those are telling you the position or situation of what was taking place but when he comes to the field when there was no combat beast see why because the fourth one would be equal and he could tell us what it is all right i know i keep repeating that but it's real good to read thee that's right see then it would have to be that this end time would depend upon whether god would keep his word and send the prophet but surely we know so we don't have to worry about it but you know what this is what i like the message or what i've stated a moment ago pull up number five there's got to be a people to receive a message but there'd not be a message that's right but we've got to get it in the correct order i want you to read what he says all right this is 1963 the fourth seal paragraph 105. no one else could do it lamb openers nobody's worthy the lamb opened the fourth seal and the fourth beast the living creature like an eagle said to john come see what the fourth mystery of the planet redemption has been hid in this book because the lamb was opening it in other words that's what he was saying there's a fourth mystery here i've showed you in symbol now john i don't know whether you understand it or not but he wrote down what he saw but it was a mystery so he wrote what he saw the lamb was breaking the seals and god still wasn't going to reveal it remember in the bible and the bible said this first seal was broke these people argued over the seals broke out sure like the brother said like not if you don't think they're broke i agree with you they ain't broke to you but don't say me ain't broke for somebody else just make your own statement ain't broke to me no they don't do that ain't broke nobody and when it breaks i'll tell you what it is now you've got that old white horse rider by the tail dangling along almighty god you might not like my attitudes with that thing but i don't mean it if you straighten brother round out if i'm straight around about then i have to be god himself i don't see why people would get upset with me doing it like that they don't like it because i frown but i'd like for you to get up here and say your brother tell me what you should say if you don't believe right around this prophecy brother said you'd make it too soft they'll thank you pulling something over on you believe that quote he said say it like it is right but look what he said the lamb broke the seal back there 2000 years ago look the lamb was breaking the seals and god still wasn't going to reveal it it was left for the last days amen so under the line they couldn't understand under the ops they couldn't understand go to the next one program 119 to the fourth seal that was not mentioned of the other times of this writer i'm watching he's talking about the fourth combat beast called him death right none of the others called him death they called him this they called him that then he called him dead okay now he's mentioned that he's called out but uh under the revelation of the line no i want to read this closer i'd be sure it wrote down the place standing here under not under the revelation of the line or or the first age the early age it wasn't revealed the next age was the age of the ox which is the dark age of middle age it wasn't revealed that's what it was come on another man like beast of wisdom representing the reformers looked at western and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age were there is to rise prophetic utterance see to whom the secrets always come you have to be a prophet with prophetic utterance right look the next one paragraph 145 the 70th week of daniel and we find out in this age there's the stars we have it there we have a star messenger we have a person we have a mission that goes we got a message it goes forth the eighth of people to reject it the people that received it the measure of this age was to come in the prayer of the lives of people to reject it for people to receive it that's been in that rage but it couldn't be comprehended down in the ages of the ox the line the man even though there were great combat beasts he was waiting to the end time but not only would there be a prophet there's got to be a prophetic people to receive that prophet okay go ahead to the next one number eight if you need it this is all the questions and answers in 60 3 which is on the seals that's really page 464 of the old seal book if you need that all right boys what it says you see he's one of those ages only taking the deal into the holy spirit justification is the work of the holy spirit sanctification is the work of the holy spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit and watch it that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down that's right you say brother brown you better hold your point and read the rest of us [Music] come on that's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down no messenger to the age come on because the holy ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism you're not gonna like this but if that ain't a zeus or street where are you gonna put it that's what he said that holy ghost he came on the day of azusa street was the baptism of the holy ghost the prophet said just exactly like the book of acts you need those quotes you say well how can you say that would be a zeus tree because of what he just said that's right but at the end of the age as it always ends up on the others we find our then the messenger sent and all these scripts and things are to be placed in their places like that then the rapture comes for the church you see there's what i said a moment ago the lion is okay in everybody the ox is okay in everybody the man is okay in everybody but when you come down to the eagle there's only one eagle hey man i agree we but what about the little eaglets that's right right to feed up on the message what do you think we're doing here 40 something years after the prophet's gone right we're supposed to be eating the message come on right man but it's got tied up in the man's ideas until they don't understand but you read that quote no messenger to the age will let you see them you say well wait a minute brother dale there's one black man black man one eyed out there i was i know the quote yeah i know this one too you can't put that black man in the ages and come down cause you're gonna do fun see there's no messenger come to azusa street the holy ghost came and said the prophet right we just read before then that prophetic people would have to be here a prophetic utterance yes what is it now my brother javelin was the street people was all goofed up so were you and i do we heard the message crow all you want to and even after 40 years of hearing the prophet's message look at the scriptures in this message two lords two souls under mercy perusing how many more you wanted to name you we're not calling ain't called about his name i call doctrine but you see we can wind up with a daylight out of luna just as easy i hope you understand that point right here there's not but one messenger and that was the prophet he brought it but he brought a wonderful message if you and i would just believe it right and let god reveal it great man stood right here in this church i had already corrected him down at the schoolhouse at guilds when he stood up down there and emphatically stated he said that luther was false wesley was false and pentecost was false i stood down there in front of him and told him i said brother and gave him the quote to page number we're brought around and that jesus street the word luther had the holy ghost wesley had the holy ghost and on the zeus street was the baptism of the holy ghost right around said just like the book of acts he said i met people 50 years ago that had the same holy ghost they come with a death pentecost a man came right here and restated that statement from this pulpit i wasn't the pastor because i would have been glad who got it behind him but you know what that man is dead and going on but everybody said he couldn't preach error you do what you want to about i approached him about it but he wouldn't correct it if i can tell you what brother ryan says and you won't correct and you're against him you're against me no problem with me i don't care whether you believe me or not i don't have anything to do with it it's whether or not you believe jesus christ lives right if he can't keep his message straight then there is no god right right what's the matter with us all right amen we see that luther wesley and azusa street brought back that prophetic people of prophetic people a prophet said right going down to number nine and i'll try to quit look what he says in 1964 305 persevere paragraph 269 you talk about the headstone it takes the whole building with it which is the church all of them will raise up come back from this first watch on to the seventh and all going to rapture each one had their day allotted to them and they had their reformers and founders and so forth all down through and this last age it come into an eagle again which is back in the prophetic age to bring this together right the prophetic age 1906 azusa street the holy ghost came in his fullness what he said i just can't see i don't give a who what you can't see it's what he said i can't see how a brown cow eats green grass and gives white milk can you well i don't quit drinking the milk but i found out the white cow gives white milk i've never found a chocolate cow to give chocolate milk to you let's see church for prophetic people to receive a message for people to reject it yes but of people to receive it because my people are doing this at the other in the end i'm trying to figure out something why why can't we stay in the message that's right why do we have to figure things out you better believe you get it figured out you got it wrong right get a good medical book about a hundred years ago the boy's sick this week you go to the doctor okay you're sick pluck a couple of toenails out and bleed him a pot of blood right and he's so weak he can't stand it but that's what they thought you understand what i'm saying what we thought down through time what mama taught us come on is okay for a time that's right but now it's time to believe the truth man the prophet said mama taught me about heaven and things he said it wasn't the way i saw it when i went back because nobody had been there i can't tell you what it is right but you see that's the way it is with this message if it's not revealed that's right amen that's why we had to have this one to come the son of man the lord jesus christ to come back in a man and declare a message that he'd already put in matthew 24. all right we had to declare it unto you but we got to become that amen what the prophet saying easter seal you become the word as you receive the word well i've read this i've read that right too many times let's read it one more time amen amen and let god speak right let him tell us the truth right we don't need somebody to straighten out this message right that's right amen the message is correct but you see we want to be big eyes and like i told someone the other day we were on our way back from the ministers meeting they gave them an illustration you know if you tear down a man's doctrine you kill him oh my god that's right around said i'm not here you remember this quote and i'm not here to preach doctrine somebody said he said i'm here to straighten out doctrine you need that quote he said i'm here to straighten it out he didn't preach a doctrine sure the bible is a doctrine church without a doctor and not a church right amen you start talking to somebody about water baptism or one god and what's the first thing they say you mean my mama wouldn't say come on how many of you done that talk to somebody and they'll come up with some form you know you mean my daddy my my brother or my you know what say you ain't said a thing about nobody being saved what you've done you exposed it why is it a catholic always a catholic because they're taught right over and they realize if they get away from it they believe they're lost there was a day when i faced that in a baptist church at 23 years of age a deeper than a baptist church teaching the sunday school class of the deacons and elders everybody and a man he lowered the moon on me he said what do you believe i said i believe god in three persons blessed trinity man this doctrine is one god but it's god free person he said you're trinitarian as anybody else you should call it a person a personality personality is an individual individual person you're just as trinity as anybody it didn't take me six months i didn't have to argue with him i looked back in his face and said i don't believe that anymore why because he had me nailed to the wall and i knew it but that's where most people don't even know when they're nailed to the wall they don't realize it i'm quoting brother brown what he said and they thought well he just don't know what him he want to quote this quote will bring it to me i'll be glad to read it because he all got to fit together amen if he was a prophet if he wouldn't a prophet let's eat drink and be murray because they're gonna be alone we're gonna die that's right you see i believe there's a people to reject the message potato people are receiving the message you and i have the opportunity to receive the message read it and study it and one day in the middle of the night trump will speak to you and you'll say thank you lord amen amen never seen that before amen so sweet and so gracious he is to us he don't slap us down and knock us around he lets us grow a little while then he comes by and visits us what about the church what about it we've had a profit he's in the word amen all right now let's believe what he said let's accept what he's saying even though it's contrary a lot of times what we think you know for profit says it we're supposed to believe it right even though it won't stay at some time what we think just been through with some brothers on daniel 70 we around emphatically states in daniel 70 weeks that jesus wrote into jerusalem on palm sunday april the second 1830. no no brother 33. my brown didn't say that no then it goes over the questions and answers on the seals you remember the three questions that was asked he said this took place april 4th a.d 30. you check your time's receiving right palm sunday was the one in daniel 70 weeks where he said it april before april the 2nd that would have been on sunday monday tuesday would have been the fourth the run set on tuesday april 4th 80 30. i don't fit i don't care because see you're looking at it one way the prophet's looking at it another way jesus was born for b.c but our calendar puts in born one right and you know we can prove it by history they don't know why the man done that because he knew jesus was born before b.c short-term history would you think they were going to believe no they're going to still try to make it 80-33 well i didn't say it around him amen see 80 33 would have been ad30 if they had put the calendar back where it was supposed to be before bc and started it with one it would have been exactly mathematically and your profit was exactly right amen you said well i got a quote where he said 33 amen and i just got to explain that 1833 is 1830 is what calendar you're looking at see this is one of those the things that seem hard to understand if we wait a little while they will come forth in the correct way right what would that break 360 inspirable 360 and a sperm you might have a need than me that is one of them has a problem that is bleeding or like a problem develops on the knee and they keep operating it doesn't work that's what we want to be praying for she's standing for somebody else and then the other one my daughter so let's just pray and agree with our sister that everything will be alright testimony illustrations please we believe is father we thank you lord for your loving grace unto us today we pray that what we said has been worthy of being said maybe our actions and reactions are not known according to what you want but i'm sorry lord i just try to get your word out the best i can and that way i don't deceive the people of them thinking that i'm trying to pull something over on them i'll just be plain and lord just help me and god be able to deliver your word and we ask you to go with this one since you're hanging there it's running the fever lord and we know that that's not a good thing to be doing with a baby like she's carrying it and father we ask you to just take care of that and be everything all right and we love you and just be with each one of us lord as we go our separate ways need a meal and bring us back together in you lord because we love you and we thank you in jesus name your dismissed excuse me i see our common need in if we never feed again me is me is uh oh replay
