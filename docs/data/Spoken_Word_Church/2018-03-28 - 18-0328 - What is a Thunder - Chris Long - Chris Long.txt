John chapter 12 of course I do bring greetings from the in Akal in cottonwood arizona and the flock there and I encourage them anytime they come this way to stop in and see you all amen and we pray that that'll happen so I'm gonna just speak on something hey you asked me for a title like the man that does the PA and the audio/visual in our church has to check track me down in the parking lot after church and say what do I call it so I'm not I'm kind of I guess on the other side okay but I gave him a couple scriptures I'm gonna read a few quotes but I'll let you relax st. John 12 everybody knows this scriptures verse 27 all right how are you with me well I better find it then now is my soul troubled and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came I unto this hour father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes now is the judgment of this world now shall the Prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me let's pray father Lord we realize that these scriptures have been read for near 2,000 years Lord but it's finally come to the place father in time and history that you've allotted for there to be a group of people who can come to the full understanding of these things now we realize Father that we couldn't do this without you sending a prophet and revealing and working through him Lord and speaking and leaving us references we could draw from that counting on you tonight Lord can't be us it must be you always for your honor and your glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you may be seated now one of my difficulties is mmm besides getting started is finding a place to stop and Annie know we're just gonna be here for 30 45 minutes you know and it's so it's so different this is an eternal word now my wife would be back there right now saying we'll just get into it but I I'm just the type of guy that wants to make sure you understand me I really do I don't I don't consider myself to be odd although I have been called a round peg in a square hole now you realize I'm a carpenter and I know a little bit about geometry you cannot get a square peg in a round hole but you can get a round peg in a square hole leaves four pyramids one in each corner but I thought maybe asked me for a title I said what is the thunder now it's been preached on I I know that and I'm not here to like I say introduce anything wild and unusual but I will use the message of the are which I know you're familiar with and we'll just see now first of all if you could refer back to your scriptures in verse 28 there came there a voice from heaven then came there a voice from heaven saying I both glorified it and will glorify it again so now we do believe in a return sort of okay brother brother my cultic and i were really ribbing each other he says I believe in return brother a return ministry you better come back and I said I'll be back brother Mike don't you worry you you understand okay all right that kind of return ministry I don't believe brother branham I believe that his body has left us but the Spirit of Christ that used him he's still here the pillar of fire that you see in the photograph taking it Sam Houston Coliseum if you don't believe it's still here tonight we got trouble if you don't believe that a piece of that pillar of fire that we see in the photograph that Moses met on the mountain is not dwelling in your heart we got a problem we're gonna have one right now it says in verse 29 the people therefore that stood by now look how close they were to Christ all right and heard it now what did they hear they heard a thunder they did not hear the voice of God in that forum they heard it in the form of a thunder so here's what brother Branham says you all know this in hearing recognizing and acting on the word first faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God I put down Romans 10:17 then the believer hears it now here's the believer these years it recognize it and acts on it but the carnal man will hear it the sound of it but never and then he pauses he says here means to understand it look at is looking at something but to see it is to understand it except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom now the reason I read that is obvious because those that stood by heard it but something happened to their hearing because here we understand they were in a coral state because the carnal man hears it but doesn't understand it the believer hears it understands it and that's on it all right so I'm here to act on it tonight I hope you're here with me to act on it all right now in the in the seals let's see right here page 124 first seal now I'm using the and I say this because I've went through five or six of the old publication the black cover whether it was a hard or a soft cover the red when I've saved that I've had for 30 38 years but now I've got the newest publication of the seal book the one with the oh I don't know what color the the cover is on but so I'm going to give you page numbers and references and they'll vary the words won't the page number in the paragraph may vary with the old publication I just want you to be aware of that on page 124 here of the new publication seal book brother branham reads John twelfth then he says then when the lamb took the book this is all important to me remember I I think the last time in the first of my serie rent you out of Revelation book of symbols it's all symbols look there's a prophetic class that word that it was sent to and they would see it or understand it they would hear it correctly all right you're with me took the book and broke that first seal City his brothers on top of it God spoke from his eternal throne to say what that seal was to be revealed but when it placed before John it was in a symbol when John saw it it was still a mystery and then he says why question it wasn't even revealed right then it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but it come in a symbol so you realize what brother Branham is telling us believe you do that what was said back then could not be revealed until now all right now when the thundered he says remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is look at the what he says now is it a voice of God in this book it says a voice of God and just reading it to you okay that's what the Bible says see a clap of thunder now they thought it was a thunder but it was God so so I'm gonna stop right there and say this now I've been around for almost forty years in in connection with the message right I got saved off the street you probably know that right into a message church didn't know God sent a prophet didn't know God had a message but I was by the grace of God able to come off the street right into the church doors of a message church I say that preaching the message you understand what I mean believing God's in a prophet so forth right so so I when I first come to the message and some of you have already passes I heard about well there's some men that call themselves the seven thunders you follow me all right sorry brother hey I fixed that thank you brother thank you now the reason why we're it a lot of people are I've been told well you overdressed brother when I play football you couldn't over dress when I race motocross you couldn't over dress yeah dad the uniform on that was appropriate for the moment so as much as I dislike wearing suits I wear them all right you with me all right now so so I want to give you how my thought process works don't worry I'm not bringing up the men of the past that thought they were the thunders but there were men who I never met who claimed from around the land of the world that they one of those thunders but I found out after the Lord opened his word to me that they're confused and the reason they're confused is not because they were bad people it's because if it comes in the form of a thunder it's misunderstood you see these people here in John 12 they had no clue they knew that it was God talking but they did not understand the voice do you know where they got the idea that God was talking to them because they got references back into the Old Testament to when God was going to meet the children of Israel on the mountain and it's sundered in it lightning and the trumpet sounded long and oh don't let God talk to us Moses would you do the job because they were afraid of God do you know why they were afraid of God in that form because he came to them by misunderstanding they did not understand God they did not know what God meant when he said something we still have people like that today and to them now these words are like thunder you follow me because brother Branham explains it right here he says when the thundered remember a loud clapping noise of a thunder is the voice of God I'll have to correct that in his book that's what the Bible says see a clap of thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it that's the key phrase right there it was not a thunder to Jesus it was the voice of God he understood completely and clearly what was being said to him so it was not in the voice in the sound of a thunder it wasn't in the form of thunder you follow me but they are worded as a thunder and then some said will an angel speak to him boy we got that going on today everybody thinks that y'all just lays on one man when it's Sun God it's not on one man it's on that and if you or I understand what God is saying it's not a thunder it's the voice of God to us I could stop right there you just let that sink in because if you'll take what he said right here and you start meditating on all the things that look mysterious to you and of course we realize I took the subject on purpose the thunders are a mystery but they're not a mystery to everybody somebody's going to come to the understanding of what God is saying and it's not going to be the sound of a thunder because I can read to you our brother Branham said the real true church in the last days is going to understand those seven voices he says so it's not nearly as mysterious as people make it out to be it's really God revealed in simplicity but you see these things don't open up to the ministry and to the people until God wants it to there's got to be a people prepared there's got to be a selection of people there's got to be a group of elect that are willing to surrender themselves to the point where God can use them God can talk to them God can reveal thanks to them and they won't get high puffed up they they they they will stay humble just due to the fact that God showed you I mean this humbles me I've talked to men for 40 years and ministries of all kinds and then when you see a little like this you go home praise them no I mean thank you God thank you for revealing it to show up babe listen now such as would learn do you know why brother branham put that with that he hid it from the wise and prudent and it revealed it unto bates now you won't find in the scriptures such as we'll learn in that string sentence but what we do find is that in the day you and I live in do you know he was only talking to you and I because the day you and I live in is the day where everybody knows everything you can't teach anybody anything anymore because they're closed up they're closed off because it's Laodicea they don't have need of nothing brother I got the same book the same Bible the same quotes the same computer chip the same program you can't tell me nothing don't ever let me get that way I want to learn at the feet of the master and I happen to know his feet are made up of people like you and I and then cuz he has no feet but ours we're told I believe that he has no hands but ours I believe that so let me finish my thought they thought it was a thunder but it was God he understood it for he was revealed to him see it was a thunder but remember he was in position to have it be the voice of God to him I love this this is good for me see because I can take that little tiny concept that little nugget right there and then when you begin to move around through the message in the scriptures you go oh man and watch it now but you start to convey that to somebody who doesn't see what you see and it sounds like lightning just struck Oh see that's what this they jumping back you know man I can't handle that well you know it's like people who don't like it a little noisy in the church I'm not speaking about Pentecostal denomination I'm talking about life you see what I'm saying and some people just sit there and then sucking on a lemon you know well I I mean I have trouble identifying the life that's in them because man when the Word of God begins to come in and vibrate the strings in your soul it's like even if you don't jump up and shout you're feeling good on the inside you know like man that's talking to me you know and you might just throw your hand up every once in a while if you don't like the noise it's alright but then you wouldn't like the throne of God man I'll read to you in Revelations 5 where the throne of God is lightnings and thunders and voice some people don't understand the throne of God thunder some people can't see into the throne of God lightning but then there are voices and those voices are talking to you and I it's the voice of God thundering out through the ages man I love that I love it though my heart is it talks to me it makes me feel humble God would look down upon my lowest state and begin to talk with me you with me I'm going to turn one corner and stop no no I've you know I told brother Wade I'm going to act like I'm at home and I like on Wednesday night I have I have a concept of time I've got ten grandchildren most of them go to school you know so it's I'm sensitive to that you've probably all worked today and if you didn't you're tired from not working have you found that out man I get cabin fever in a minute but the more I sit around the tireder I get the more I sleep the more I want to sleep so I pray Lord just give me three or four or five good hours and let me get out of that bed but like the Prophet said as you get it a little up there in years it's hard to swing one leg out of that bed after the other you know I know what he's talking about got arthritis and this and that and I'm not testifying about the devil I'm just saying we're beat up I'm just the kind of guy that's praying for people like you and me to get a new body because I need one I need one right now can't hardly see my hair's going bye-bye bye it's even worse now and I made the mistake of seeing a barber a barber Parris Island South Carolina you can tell he just cuts Marines all day long I lost about two pounds last week that's all right it'll grow back right Amen you love this this speaks to me I'm gonna read a little bit further here okay paragraph 148 here in this book and notice the first seal opened the first seal when it was opened in the symbol form it thundered now now you know why nobody understood it yet it was still in the form of a mystery it was in the form of symbols that God had not revealed to anybody he didn't even reveal him to join yet the reason I say yet is because we're taught by the Prophet that John here represented the entire body of Christ I don't have to read you that quote you can find yourself okay he says when it was open in the symbol form it thundered now what about here's what I want to get you tonight now what about when it's opened in its reality form okay it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back the seal and what did they reveal not all of itself first it's with God next it's in a symbol then it's revealed three things see it's coming forth from the throne first it can't be seen heard or nothing it's sealed up the Lambs blood paid the price it thundered when he spoke it out and when he did a white horse rider started out and we know still a symbol he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol and then he says do you understand it church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse writer now we've all gotten that far even when brother Branham was visited every morning by the angel of that church to reveal to him correctly what each seal was he gave us the definition of the white horse rider but there's still a lot of confusion there's still a lot of confusion because those are things that we can read those are things that can be defined by a dictionary those are things don't let it shock those are things that the devil can read he can read these books just like me and matter of fact he studies way more than all of us put together but the one thing he lacks is a relationship with God so that he can have the revelation of what's being said what's being written what's being preached you can see this is some of my favorite stuff paragraph 151 and only listen now and only it's to be revealed at the last day this is the key when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ see because everybody wants to keep laying it back on the prophet I've already explained this to you folks I've been here at least twice there ain't nobody in here who holds the prophet of God that came in the 20th century in any higher regard than me I mean that but I've begun to see it's not all on the prophet and the reason it's not all on the prophet is because if you realize what God was trying to do before the foundation of the world he was called Elohim now if it was all gonna rest on one man then he could have remained out of him and carried out this plan but he did not want to remain self existent he wanted to exist with his attributes and therefore he was gonna have to rely listen now devil wherever you act he was gonna have to rely on the likes of people like you and me my wife was talking to me last night now and she said well what about this and what about that I said honey do you realize now I'm not I want you to understand before I close I'm not using this analogy in any way shape or form to demean what we believe but I'm gonna give it to you the way that I can explain it to myself so that I can see it this is not a chess game but to Satan it is it's a chess game to Satan and God doesn't have any problem with that and I've played chess for years don't play it anymore it bores me because the Word of God is preeminent in my life but I realized right away to be good at chess your pawns are your most important men on the board and you say well no they're the weakest yes but if you understand chess they are the greatest diversion you have you move a pawn over here and it gets the opponent what's he doing what's he doing now well the opponent thinks I want his King right I want checkmate on him so I'm not going to concern myself right now with that pawn watch it that pawn can take out any other piece on the board including the King if he can get in position to do it you with me so it's not all these great big boom boom boom lightning and thunders sometimes it's the steel small voice which seems to be the smallest insignificant piece on the board and it's the one God's gonna use to work its way to where it's checkmate do you understand that that's why there's nothing wrong with well with understanding insignificance you shouldn't feel insignificant because God is no respecter of persons you say well brother I understand chess in the rook can do this and and the bishop can do this and the Queen can do this and everybody's focusing on the queen man if I can get the Queen broke free she can move around yeah but if she ever gets taken out by a pawn you're just about finished you've lost the most important piece on the board outside of the King and notice the Kings always in the back huh he's always in the background and a good chess player is just barely moving the King just enough to stay out of the line of fire you don't have to feel insignificant but I'm glad that we are because the devil overlooks people like you and me well you don't understand brother my life is like hell right now but devil is on the warpath praise the Lord that means you might be on the Lord's side because if the devil ain't on you you might be in trouble you see what I'm saying and he is fighting everybody I do I'm a pastor but I travel one week out of the month because that's what the Lord has told me to do the congregation is okay with it and as long as they're ok with it brother Samuel huh go but you would not believe how many people are being pummeled because he only has a short time and did you know he knows it he still thinks in the back of his mind I might do this you understand I'm ight do this I might accomplish this but here's the other side of him if I don't I'm gonna take everybody with me if I gotta go down you're all going with me I Got News for him there's people who are walking just above that level and my mind goes back to the Book of Numbers where Nathan and Korah challenged Moses and Moses come off the mountain and God said now listen here you that are with me come on over I knew that or not stay over there and a humongous earthquake opened up the earthers started swallowing all the make believers and all the unbelievers and I remember one of the first messages I preached and it was just how did that how did the believer stand next to the chasm and not fall in how did the Israelite make it with all I grew up in California I know about earthquakes they were walking just above the surface of the earth you know this earth they were they were walking just above the sinful flesh as a type and did not get sucked in to the damage and brothers and sisters that's how close we are I mean we're just a hair's breadth away but as long as you got the Holy Ghost lift Jesus higher if I be lifted up he said I'll drop I'm in unto me do you love him you probably think I'm crazy I'm almost finished and only is to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church oh praise the Lord notice now oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride see watch now watch the difference between everybody else in the bride so that you'll understand it he's good to us please stand oh I can keep preaching brother you know no maybe for five more minutes while you're standing out because you know how it is see at the top of the pyramid now I'm a retired framer built a lot of houses and a lot of buildings shoulders are worn out from doing but when you get to the top the corners come quicker and faster and quicker and faster and but I'll tell you something about the top of the building if one of those corners is off at the top it's way more noticeable then if you got off an inch down at the bottom now a good carpenter can correct a foundation that's out of square he's really got to pull some tricks you got a noisy stuff but he can cover that up with siding or brick mold or whatever it might be but when you get up to the top and you got a little something medicator it's like well I am buying that house that corner up there I can see right now on that dormers out of out see brothers and sisters so that's where we're at we're turning the corners quick and fast to finish this and and you know that the capstone you've read this is not some big blunt instrument that slams down on the top brother branham said it was more like a needlepoint like a spire but we don't see it that way we just see the pyramid just terminating just like this at a de at a four 12 pitch but that's not what he said he said it goes up to almost a sharknado point did you realize that that's just about where we're at we're just about to the peak right of the peak of the peak let's pray Heavenly Father Lord were just thankful that we could have the opportunity and the time to share a thought with your children Lord I believe father that were gathered here because we're all of like faith we all hunger and thirst father for more view and I realize Lord that the ministry that you've ordained today that you have placed Lord will just be here a little and very little Lord line upon line precept upon precept Lord so that we can all get to the finish we sure love you we sure thank you Lord and we ask for your help always being careful to give you all the praise and the honor and the glory and the precious and lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ god bless you the musicians can come I'll screech out a couple of verses and then brother you better come take over now I know it's hard to believe and I'm not bragging I used to be a song leader but after I started preaching a lot that went away yeah yeah I can hear the sound thereof the key of C probably saying this the last time it's one of my favorite things to sing no no no
