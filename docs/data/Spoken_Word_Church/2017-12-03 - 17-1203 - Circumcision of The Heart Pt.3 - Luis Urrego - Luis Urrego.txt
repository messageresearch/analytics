========================================

I like that that's pretty name it is going somewhere you want to pick it's a video walkie-talkie right that's pretty much what it is it's nice yummy a joke at birth deal I don't go over the world one alright let's get started hmm all right we're gonna it has followed my lot to continue this Sunday today so we're gonna continue with part three of circumcision of the heart and more women next Sunday brother harun take my take over okay I trust everybody's doing okay I'm ready to hear the word restart the Lord and to reason I just to receive a blessing but to be able to say man work on that all right so let's continue the part there on the left hand bleep up we've got just a few more slides and then we'll just go as quick as possible now so so what is circumcision of our circumcision of the heart means the Holy Spirit going in and doing her work in the heart of man cutting off excess flesh you cannot be circumcised spiritually if the Holy Spirit is not taken oh right right again you can't give up nothing in your life without the Holy Spirit working in your life try drinking smoking none of that you'll do it and you feel okay that's right if the Holy Spirit doesn't tell you hey this isn't right for Kristen that dude you'll just keep on doing it right but the whole universe is a thing we can't be people's Holy Spirit you can close such-and-such brother or such a sighs sister though they're still doing this let the Lord do this all right and we don't do don't rush to work with God in there and let's just be patient with people that's B that's because God was patient with us right now amen now if this has nothing to do with the flesh and again it yet it does because the work starts from the inside out we were speaking about this last night at the Bible study which really don't miss don't worry there yeah there was there was there was some interesting topics some interesting things that had were discussed some some bouts between sister Trudy and brothers a huge American thing Avenue that's just a visa and I'm just joking for the people in the internet we got a good time I don't know why she's turning red no h-he got stragglers killing it you need to introduce them all okay welcome everybody welcome god bless y'all have a seat welcome to the house of God tell me later bro all right and this is just last week so to obtain a closer walk with Christ you must have a change from within which which will then manifest on the outside where the brand says here the circumcision is a type of the Holy Ghost then God gave Abraham the circumcision signed after he had accepted God on his promise and walked out into a strange country see it was a sign and all his children and his seed after him should have the Sun in their flesh because it was a distinction that's right that was back then it was to separate them from all all other people in this town of circumcision and that's what God uses today is the sign of circumcision of the heart the holy spirit that makes God's church a separated church from all of the Creed's faiths and denominations there in all kinds of denominations but yet they are two separated people God knows his own ever man and God knows the exact time when they're gonna come out so in God from the beginning was more interested in the heart than anything else physical circumcision we won't read all Deuteronomy but look what verse 16 said I mean this is back in Moses time verse 16 circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart God already talking about the foreskin of your heart not just the foreskin the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiff neck but so the whole thing see I was discussing this with my wife Waldo even when God gave him the law the Ten Commandments he knew they were not going to be able to keep those for those those Commandments but he wanted them to realize that they can do and so and so that's the reason so that therefore grace could take over and Paul speaks about those things on their own so we can't hide behind the nomination walls or wall the works or any type of fleshly material wall you know those things are man-made cannot keep call God statues and I was in Europe even though God required it in the Old Testament this to show and to fructose that we can depend upon physical circumcision or external changes of the flesh to live the life of God it's all about Christ in you the hope of glory so if you want price in your life get the King of glory in your heart now look what Romans chapter 2 if you read Romans chapter 2 bits up the whole chapter when you get some time but this is very interesting it's just mr. stream it says here verse 17 behold our called a Jew and rest isn't the law and makest thy boast of God and knowest his will and approve us the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law and are confident the Dalai self are a guide of the blind the light of them which are in darkness and instructor the foolish a teacher of aids which has the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law Pharisees had to seize all these people they did everything external but again when Christ came on the scene the Messiah that they were saying he's come he's coming and when he came he came the way the day a different total way they didn't accept the word for their hour now therefore which teaches another teach us not thyself now that preaches the man should not steal this house thou that say as a man should not commit adultery there's now committed notice now that of course idols of document sacrilege now that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonours though God for the name of God is blasting among the Gentiles through you as it is written once verse 25 for circumcision barely property this is Paul speaking but him being circumcised himself convenient you if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision alright therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his circumcision be counted for circumcision now Paul's gettin into spiritual the spiritual aspect now in other words the the Jew you and me if we keep the law again shouldn't that be considered to us as as we were circumcised you see but you can't keep the law unless you have the Holy Spirit the law is not just the Ten Commandments the law is the whole Word of God but it's not a book of rules so where the deal was talking about it it's the grace of God for trait to each and every one of us and in those Ten Commandments is the grace of God because again the lettuce no I can't do it Lord okay let me step that's what God wants amen and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfill the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision does transgress the law for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly so it has nothing to do with physical again hearing them in the message and not just in the message but in the nomination of rim you get it the Pentecostal Holiness and all the Pentecostal that believe in women dressing right and things like that but they can get so stuck on that outside oh the hair is long the dresses are long everything is right but but they don't they don't live right at home but on the outside they're okay but on the inside they're full of dead men's bones like Jesus mm but you can have a pair all the way down here but you still not make it but your tongue D that long to see has nothing to do with your hair being that long or he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh Paul referring to spiritual but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter so again Paul says another play the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the commandments kill you can kill you the do's and don'ts will kill you the do's and don'ts will kill people again when you come into this message or when you receive the word it's a we're off we all come in a legalist then you realize at some point wait a second this isn't good point right there when your children start doing things that you thought that they weren't going to do then you change your mind about things then in disparity not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of God that's the reason Saints you know I pray for my children I put them before the Lord but in the in my mind I'm thinking Lord if you don't do the work I won't be surprised if if if they go straight I'm not claiming that but if they go astray Lord the word has already been there I thought we've already presented the work for them you do the work after that way but I I'm not going to condemn other people's children do they do this that that when later on my children might do the same thing or worse a physical circumcision was the key when they were when with then why were the sons of day come back stabbers if physicals are considered back thing was appealing literally they killed Shechem the son of Haman in order to give it a bench for Dinah their sister you read that in Genesis 34 so they had circumcision back then frizam but they went ahead and killed you know they were Jacob sons were backstabbers and they were murdering Meyers lying to their father by Joseph fornicators and adulterers yet they were physically circumcised the Pharisees were physically circumcised does that mean there were all children of God no but Jesus called them whitewashed tombs something more money said your father to do this works you think but they were physically circumcised again looking at this on the spiritual aspect you can know you can know again we're talking to last night you can know all mysteries Hall has the Paul said you can know the whole word you can know every revelation upon Revelation but if the life is not manifested the Holy Spirit is not working in you manifesting on the outside changing you and desire and making you desire to be more like Christ day by day then all those mysteries all that knowledge is for naught right it's just puff puff just makes you puffed up but inside we're filled with corruption and dead men's bones you read that Matthew twenty thirty seven Judas was also circumcised physically did that stop him from doing what he did to the Lord Jesus no so how can God start circumcised in our hearts hmm Leviticus 26 41 it says in that I also have walk contrary unto them and have brought them into the land owners if then they're uncertain sounds hard to be humble and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity humility is important point in order to come to Christ you hear the word and in order for you to receive his word you have to humble yourself if you don't humble yourself you know what the time I heard the work I had to so I realize Lord I'm nothing I'm nothing and if without you I cannot change I wanted to change but I couldn't change and you come to that point where humility that's what God is saying there uncertainty sighs it's hard to be humble which are going kind of quickly but you know the time is limited so we must first humble our hearts before God can begin circumcised in our harvest humble yourself repent be baptized in the Lord Jesus Christ God and then God says the Holy Spirit starts working in your life you'll start cutting things in your life your mom won't have to tell you anything in this case nobody your pastor will have to tell you anything your friends want to tell you anything God will point out to you exactly what needs to start being cut from your life and he'll do it that's part of circumcision of the heart you know right now you might there's something in your life you might be struggling with or you don't think it's okay you know it's this point but don't be surprised is the Holy Spirit you know later on they say look that's not right for a Christian because it is a constant sanctification it's not just sanctification one time it's not justification one time no it's a constant justification and the constant sanctification in the believers life favor Paul said being born again right it's a constant being born again so it's not just dying out one time and that's it no I'm just I'm sure there's things that have to die out in me but at a later point that right now I may not may not I may not realize but later on I may have to do to die off to certain things you know so that's why you say Lord examine my heart show me where I'm wrong tell me in a humble me because when your homeboy Amen and have more greater effect on the people amen wait you're sleeping okay yeah so how do we begin to humble ourselves by having faith in the Word of God believing this word all right well Graham says lord I feel that's right that's a crumb come on that's how what you have to do come are we ready to take the crumbs speaking of this ceremony shamone are we ready to humble ourselves she was she was ready to humper herself faith always admits the word right faith is always humbled brothers brother was last night speaking when he was talking he said when you can't accept the word being right and you can't admit the word being right when once you do that that's that's your new birth no part of receiving the word but if you don't say if you can't accept Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever like that you have they always admits the word right faith is always humble faith humbles itself now she was just looking for the crumbs watch what Jesus said for this same for this thing I'm willing to take the crumbs Lord for this thing my child is hold you you have your request because you believe it faith admits that the Word of God is Right faith and let's all these things praise the Lord so how can God start circumcised in our heart this is beautiful you remember when David came when he had done his sin with Bathsheba and then and then that nathan who was in Nathan the Prophet he came to Nathan the Prophet he said hey look David's out there doing wrong you could go talk to him tell him this this this this and that so Nathan goes to him - David tells him what's what's wrong and of course David's think you know you know hey speak to me the word of the Lord what do you have to say proper than opinion or prophet Nathan he's like he tells him what he did and say look he took another man's wife and you had him killed and you don't even deserve to be a king and what does David do it mediate listen did he say Oh get out of my court no he didn't kick him out he humbled himself right there and he did from because that man had the word of the Lord Network and he started East he started having a repentant heart but but what's this even before David got because later on he gets down to the to the actual act of of repenting and you can read his repentance in Genesis and now in Psalms 52 I believe one of those songs there but even before he got down to that actual act of repentance Nathan the prophet at that meeting told him don't worry the Lord has already forgiven yourself because why because God knew his heart I knew that he was really repented so he was humbled and so David had to first have faith in the word of Nathan to Humble himself of course which led him to repentance and this is a scripture behold of Psalm 51 with what David says here behold thou desirous truth in the inward parts not on the outward part is now desires truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part that shall make me to know wisdom has to do with the heart that's to do with him from the inside out and then burst tank create in me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within me now we need David that wasn't a new birth maybe David in the Old Testament Saints you know they didn't have the new birth because Christ had come and died offered himself and all that but they could feel an anointing upon you you know they could feel you know they could feel they could bit like brother Desmond speaking about they had a form of salvation right so David realized what it was like to live with and without God spirit verse 10 David put together the act of good clean heart in him with renew a right spirit within again not the new birth who can give us the right spirit but the holy spirit himself yeah I can't do it on my own it was up to me I'd still be party yes they'll be drinking trying to please my friends yeah yeah that's it I have something different for you anyway one day when I was a senior I'll still in brother direct my testimony the other day we're just kind of testifying to each other the other day and at my senior year in high school I said Lord I are he stopped I have to stop living this life I can't go on like this anymore trying to please my friends and my parents at the same time and thinking I've shown a certain life in front of my parents and yet living a certain life in front of my friends lord I it's a terrible life to live in a direct way you know when you're not living for Christ so it's the Holy Spirit that can genuinely circumcise our hearts from all unbelief no I'm believe is sin amen all of us need to more to be cut out of our lives not just from the outside but from the inside out what good will it do a drunkard to empty his liquor bottles and he still has that desire within that's right now what good will it be for smoker to throw away this pack of cigarettes and these guys and desire to smoke that's right there's no good well good well the thing where you get rid of hip hop rock and roll country music CDs or mp3s be stuff and desire to listen to that music what good will it do a man who put Internet filters on his computer in his home in order to not visit appropriate websites and he still has that desire to visit those sites again rather have their work started the desire to come from inside out I came in this is why we have to take God's Word just as he said it they think God's Word humble ourselves then God can go changing us from within when David did this look how different his thoughts and actions were even before the new birth came in the picture and and I have some examples here because God responded to Dana's repentance with grace David show grace to others after that true wicked with epsilon and Epsilon his son son rebelled against him was about to overtake before to take the kingdom of David fled to Jerusalem with those who followed him he said okay I have so long ago had to do what you need to do it neatly yeah he was willing to just you know this his David showed more Grace and more humbleness you know after his what happened to him even before the new birth a minute and the man by the name of Shiva came out to curse David one time and to throw stones at Amina read this in second samuel 16 i wish i wanted to cut his head wanted to cut shimai his head but david would not allow him to do so instead when they would return to jerusalem one of those there to meet and welcome him was she me and himself the one who threw rocks at me who confessed to David that he had sinned in what he had tried to do to him a bashar once again wanted to execution me and this time he had a biblical reason if you read that he tells him he called attention to the fact that she mean he had cursed David the king of Israel and the law of Moses forbade cursing the ruler of the people so David knew this and shame EA should have been put to death but David forgave him and granted him his life amen so David's it was like God called vena the man after my own heart David realized you know it's all about the inward parts Lord it's all about me working within God called him in this even before he was king of Israel actually knew that what state that wasn't famous party and because God loved David he had to be punished for his sin God doesn't punish those that are not his god doesn't that God doesn't review those who was he gonna waste his time you know but he doesn't have time why is he gonna you know with those that are not his you know I'm glad he does that that way I'm sure you know because some if he just lets us get by with whatever you know if I just let my daughter's get by with whatever happens in whatever they do in their life there is going to be speech spoiled and you know but we can't let him move so if we don't allow it in the physical with our own children how much more God he cares for his own thing alright and this is the last slide Hebrews 12:5 curtain and II have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him in other words don't get weary don't get tired that means you can you you fail the tests and so you need to pass it you need to take it again that means X actually gets grace God have many chances not just a God with one chance two chances three Peter remember Peter asked him Lord how many times I forgive my brother Nathan Jesus said yeah but is it seven times seven times I have 70 done but that doesn't mean 400 and what for honey 498 doesn't mean more than 90 x squared that's just the metaphor or sub to represent and hey forgive them many times unlimited times my brother Dan was saying last night you'll forgive him now as humans we can't forget but that's the thing we're brother branham people would walk around him and you wouldn't be able to tell who was his enemies and we'll who was his friends he'd treat them all the same I want the Holy Spirit to do a work in my life that that can happen in my life where you can see exactly hey you're my enemy you did this to me but I'm gonna still treat you like my friend but because that person soul is more important than whatever you did to me if I can win that soldier amen that's worth it ten thousand worlds and the only way you're gonna win a soul is by showing love not hate all forgiveness is the truth but I'm not gonna forget it you're doing damage to the person you're still you're still holding something there like one you know one time somebody said he's a Christian too but I forget he said you know what movies you know he said he said if I wasn't a Christian right now because I did I had done something to him I should have done he said if I if I wasn't a Christian I would rip your face open right now I'm thinking blazing a Christian doesn't even talk that way you shouldn't at least like he meant it did so anyways verse six for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth verse seven aphelion their chastening God dealeth with us with sons what son is he whom the father chase an anomaly but if ye be without chastisement we're of are all partakers then are you bastards and not sons in other words if you go without punishment and you're just a bastard child spiritually and you're not his son furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us going to the physical our parents and we gave them reverence I don't know children now they do that but I didn't we do we also grown up you know modern you know slippers being thrown at us and the belt Hickory sticks and all kinds of things but you know what I still I still love my mom and dad yeah I'm thankful for them and get my mom and dad did that my mom did those things when she was not Christian nowadays she sees and she even feels bad when I even pulled out a belt expecting them like that but look mom you've had your yahoo let let us have our time and out you know he was because he has grandparent until she's got great bird mentality because this is our time now this you know him but my mom you know she tells me she says she says son you know I feel bad you know some of the things that we said to you all that we did did and we did it ignorantly they were not Christians you know my mom and dad you know my dad you know there be cursing in the house and stuff like that you know I grew up that way cursing and all kinds of things and Doug but because they didn't love the Lord you know they were in Christian era Catholics back then well once that that changed in their life that was one of the first things that started changing in my mom's life it was the way she would do layers and you knew the Lord was working now if you know she for the way you wouldn't think she'd be that way never mind that your home will be different it's just how the Lord does that work it's totally changes hearing that totally changes you're going one direction and continue to 180 degrees or the other way totally the other way that's the kind of work that God doesn't realize that's the circumcision of the heart up your neck so we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of the spirits and live verse 10 for verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he God for our profit for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness I like that image yes God has no other purpose but for you to be more like him that's the reason why he'll what is this happen in my life it just wants you to be like me or why are you doing this to me it just wants you to be like him that's all so we just thank the Lord amen so how many I was able to get done with part three now this is the last part of itself so again circumcision was instituted back in the Old Testament through with Abraham as a sign right but spiritually we are spiritually circumcised the Holy Ghost is the token and he as though he's the sign right but he's the one who does the circumcision cutting off excess flesh in our heart in our lives amen again let the Holy Spirit do the work not just in your life let the Holy Spirit do the work in other people's life but stop the condemning you know it's so easy for us to do that let's just let the Lord do the work and he does it the best and we didn't do it it's like we can't change our children let them have their own experience with God let them when they got that experience with God they have no change when you try to force the experience in their life that won't work that's the dupe has to be gutted it's got any questions any comments we have bottle nuts but then when somebody does and despicable being to be I remember it but I find it very difficult forgiving yeah it's not easy for none of us then it can be done and you're talking about the Holy Spirit sometimes that then that I've noticed since I've become pretty thick in the word that the Holy Spirit doesn't work just from well you might work from within but with me chasing women and drinking and all that the women hate me I didn't do that and I don't I don't have the taste for it anymore I didn't do that I got a couple cases of booze in my closet it's sitting there forever and so it's not me doing this my choice would be the other way okay so maybe the Holy Spirit shines a bright light these women's eyes and runs them off you know so I just uh you know read then go when you get serious with God he'll mean business with you I'm not saying you're not meaning so this that was God he's serious sometimes he turns you around when you're like it or not that that freak step elder Dale is stuck in my head he turns you around right now yeah but at the same time he's not gonna force you to do nothing that you don't want to do Oh gentlemen but when you threat you see this a kind of a disclaimer when you pray you say I'd give my life to to Jesus Christ you're done you can fight it any minute turn you around and you know you can't get out of it yeah so your life is mine and now with that but I've also given my son's and all the sons for a thousand years so I told my son's the other day but your life starts going going down and getting problematic you give me a call but that will be square sometimes when you send the holy rap from you gotta let him do the work sometimes it'd be the one who the working let's do it anyway yeah sure well he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna bring you to a point where you are going to accept what he's trying to do in your life yeah you may not say that yeah but afterwards you'll go without you only way that's the only way and it comes when God does something it's like we do something late mistake but dog does something his hands in it it's perfect it's gotta be he can't do anything halfway along so whatever he does even if he has to put you in a hospital sure even in the s I mean you're up there at death you see the white the white light at the tunnel and even at that point God is doing exactly what he needs to do he knows exactly how to deal with each one of us he doesn't deal with us in every the same way he knows exactly how to deal with you he doesn't exactly how to deal with me he knows exactly how to deal with you birthday therefore let's just be mindful of that and sometimes we wonder lord is this that this has happen to me in my life right now step back and say Lord is this you know and because now nothing that happens to have it happens just to happen I believe God everything you know yeah for your Christian even your footsteps or the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord my Bible says Amen god bless self image [Music]
