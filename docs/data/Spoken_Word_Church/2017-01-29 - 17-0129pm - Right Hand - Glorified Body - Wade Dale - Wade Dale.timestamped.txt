[12:43] right and that's where you'll find him I
[12:45] was speaking this morning the know the
[12:48] Bible said the world see me no
[12:49] more but you'll see me that's right now
[12:52] he's lying if if we can't see him right
[12:55] but by revelation we can see him or
[12:57] understand him and the world just cannot
[13:00] understand him we uh we had a good time
[13:03] this week in uh in Myrtle Beach and uh
[13:06] it's not like Port St Joe Nick it just
[13:09] ain't like Port St Joe but I tell you
[13:12] what we stayed on the 15th
[13:15] floor of a 6 about 600
[13:19] unit place and we had we met no
[13:23] one no one in the uh elevator all right
[13:28] no one no no one rode up or
[13:30] down and um and we were actually feeling
[13:34] pretty good we was the youngest people
[13:35] we saw in that
[13:38] place even though I turned 57 on
[13:41] Thursday we were still the youngest ones
[13:43] in the whole
[13:44] place cuz um they were uh they were U no
[13:50] one there we had no weights in the
[13:51] restaurants some of you saw on Facebook
[13:53] Jun posted with the crab legs and all
[13:56] that was a that was a good birthday
[13:57] present so amen thank you all for your
[14:00] prayers thank you for your support and
[14:02] and for your uh kind words on my
[14:04] birthday and the ones that gave me
[14:06] things and and the ones of you that
[14:08] didn't um we'll remember
[14:12] that right sister
[14:15] Johnny this Johnny gave me a wonderful
[14:17] pen a few minutes ago but that's all
[14:19] right but uh good to be in the house of
[14:21] the Lord we had a good time this morning
[14:24] and uh brother Luis got speaking in
[14:26] tongues speaking he spoke in tongues the
[14:27] whole service
[14:31] but we had a good time and uh his mom
[14:33] and Dad are on their way so we're going
[14:35] to have to make and and his sis two
[14:36] sisters are on the way so uh if they
[14:39] come in a little bit later and Louise
[14:41] has to
[14:42] interpret he'll be speaking in tongues
[14:45] again but his mother and father needs
[14:47] interpretation so I'm just going to let
[14:48] him come up here and start interpreting
[14:50] if that's all right okay so because they
[14:52] don't uh speak very well English and
[14:55] that's okay we want them to hear what
[14:56] hear what the word of the Lord has to
[14:58] say so if you got your ibles let's turn
[14:59] to the Book of
[15:00] Matthew 26 we're going to continue our
[15:03] thought on barred womb to a barred tomb
[15:06] and you know last Sunday we spoke on
[15:07] word the word made dust or the word made
[15:11] flesh and um this is going to carry up a
[15:15] little higher as far as toward Jesus is
[15:18] already being glorified but I want to
[15:20] bring a point out and then we're going
[15:21] to back up and look at his life among
[15:24] the Pharisees and Sadducees because his
[15:26] life among the Pharisees and Sadducees
[15:28] is going to be
[15:29] pretty much exactly the way we're going
[15:32] to have the demons we're going to have
[15:33] to fight of the same ones he fought and
[15:35] if he can overcome them so can we
[15:38] because he already overcome him one time
[15:40] amen he overcame him in human flesh and
[15:43] if he's in you in human flesh he's got
[15:45] to overcome amen if we allow him to
[15:48] overcome he will overcome so uh we were
[15:51] you know we had to do the time share
[15:52] thing I just want to tell you a little
[15:53] something about that we um uh got down
[15:56] to to the guy giving his sales pitch you
[15:58] know and I told him I said um right at
[16:01] the end I just kind of jumped up and sat
[16:03] down on the countertop and made myself
[16:04] comfortable on one of them big uh rooms
[16:07] you know and you know me and I said look
[16:10] buddy he said well you can do this you
[16:12] can raffle it off for the church you
[16:13] know he was giving his sales pitch you
[16:15] can do this you I said look buddy I said
[16:17] let me tell you let me just be real
[16:18] Frank with you I said we don't mix
[16:21] bathe we don't wear bathing suits you'll
[16:25] never see us in the same area as as and
[16:28] I said it don't make us no better than
[16:29] anybody else it's just that we don't
[16:31] believe in those things so this is not
[16:33] this is not the environment that we want
[16:35] to be in we don't believe in these
[16:38] things we we don't we're not like you
[16:40] know 99.9% of the people that he talked
[16:42] to he would have a sales pitch to go
[16:44] back with what they would say you know
[16:46] he'd you'd say this he'd say this well
[16:48] buddy when I told him that you didn't
[16:49] tell you he just said all right come on
[16:50] let's go he's done he what's he going to
[16:54] say what's he going to I mean we're
[16:58] we're in the world and listen and I want
[17:00] to I want to apologize for all of you
[17:02] that like the Beats from Sister Lisa all
[17:04] the way to the front I will not ever say
[17:07] I don't like the beach again I don't
[17:08] like the beach with a bunch of people in
[17:10] it
[17:11] right but that it was really nice listen
[17:14] God made the place he the Creator made
[17:16] that for somebody to enjoy and I'm not
[17:18] going to say that I don't like Lisa said
[17:21] amen me me me me me y'all going to see
[17:24] Lisa and glory and oh she's going to
[17:25] have a little island and it's going to
[17:26] have sand and water all the way around
[17:29] and she's going to be doing this for
[17:30] about 10,000
[17:32] years and then 10,000 more she going to
[17:34] be going back in this
[17:36] direction amen and that's all right but
[17:39] but forgive me for saying that and being
[17:41] derogatory toward the beach because God
[17:42] made the beach he made that beach for
[17:45] somebody to enjoy and I um I just don't
[17:47] like all the filth and junk that we
[17:49] didn't see right everything was fine
[17:51] everything was good and and and clear we
[17:53] could we could open the balcony and you
[17:55] could hear the waves coming in at night
[17:57] and it was nice we had had a good time
[17:59] and I apologize I'm not going to be
[18:00] derogatory toward the beach anymore I
[18:03] it's a place God made for somebody he
[18:05] just didn't make it all for me he made
[18:07] it for brother dick and sister Gail and
[18:10] sister Lisa and some of the others but
[18:11] that and that's fine so we should not we
[18:13] should watch what we say and that's what
[18:15] I need to do I need to watch kind of
[18:17] don't be derogatory toward uh where
[18:19] people go on vacation you go wherever
[18:21] you please but you can be you know in
[18:23] the world but not out the world we have
[18:26] to be I mean you can see as much at work
[18:28] as you do on the beach if you really
[18:29] want to see it that's right okay so so
[18:32] forgive me for that I we really had a
[18:34] super good time had a good birthday we
[18:36] um we just enjoyed oursel we took a nap
[18:39] when we wanted to take a nap we got up
[18:40] when we wanted to get up so but I was
[18:42] ready to get back home ain't no place
[18:44] like home anyway amen so let's go to
[18:47] Matthew 26 like I said Thank you some of
[18:50] you U supported us going and and and uh
[18:55] some had some good things to say about
[18:57] my birthday and I really appreciate it
[18:59] not not worthy of any of it but thank
[19:02] you for saying it Matthew
[19:04] 26 we're going to speak today on uh I
[19:07] was telling uh Louis I said you you'll
[19:10] get it this
[19:11] afternoon but uh Lord showed me
[19:13] something and and I about did one of
[19:15] them brother Brandon running around Tree
[19:17] fets in my living room when I saw this
[19:20] and and I hope you see it the same way
[19:21] that I saw it like brother brand said I
[19:23] hope I can give this in the same way it
[19:24] was given me cuz I want you to see
[19:27] that listen it's all in the word there
[19:30] is no extra word that's right it's all
[19:33] in the word so but there's layers that
[19:37] you'll sit there and read the thing and
[19:38] read it and read it and then all of a
[19:39] sudden you'll go well that's the only
[19:42] way it could happen that's right right
[19:44] so I had one of those aha moments
[19:46] yesterday in studying this is I want to
[19:48] bring it out is it's called right hand
[19:51] glorified
[19:52] body you say well that's kind of strange
[19:55] but you'll get it in a minute maybe all
[19:57] right Matthew 26
[19:59] 63 and let's bow our heads dear Lord
[20:02] Jesus we thank you today for
[20:04] the people you've give us to be around
[20:07] be friends with be fellow servants with
[20:11] be brothers and sisters in the Lord we
[20:13] pray now that you'd sanctify us for this
[20:15] journey bless this day keep us safe keep
[20:19] the devil away from us
[20:21] all the ones that are sick Lord we pray
[20:25] that right now that they would get
[20:26] better Lord that that Satan know that
[20:28] he's a
[20:30] defeated at Calvary and that you've
[20:33] overcome and now that you've made us
[20:34] Overcomers in
[20:35] you father forgive us of our sins and
[20:37] many mistakes that we make be the active
[20:40] participant in this service Lord take
[20:42] care of each one of us may the hearers
[20:44] hear May the seers see and the speaker
[20:47] speak but it not be anything but your
[20:49] word take care of us Lord bless us give
[20:52] us this day our daily bread in Jesus
[20:54] name amen Matthew 26:63 says but but
[20:58] Jesus held his peace now this is like I
[21:00] said this is toward the end of his
[21:02] ministry so they're uh they're getting
[21:04] ready to put him on the cross but watch
[21:06] what he says and the high priest
[21:07] answered and said unto him I adure Thee
[21:09] by the Living God that thou tell us
[21:11] whether thou be the Christ the son of
[21:13] God now remember brother Bram said Jesus
[21:15] never said called himself Son of God
[21:17] what did he say he said thou said thou
[21:19] has said
[21:22] nevertheless I say unto
[21:25] you
[21:27] Hereafter now not today he was in a
[21:30] pretty pretty pretty pretty good pickle
[21:32] at that time he was getting ready to be
[21:33] crucified Hereafter shall ye see the son
[21:37] of man sitting on the right hand of
[21:40] power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven
[21:44] all right now you can be seated and
[21:45] we'll read the book of Mark the Mark has
[21:48] uh The Book of Mark pretty much has the
[21:49] same the same thing but I want you to
[21:53] see
[21:54] something why Jesus didn't say that at
[21:58] the
[21:59] beginning of his ministry he's saying
[22:02] it's toward the end of his ministry is
[22:04] that all right amen toward the end of
[22:07] his me Hereafter shall ye see the son of
[22:09] man sitting on the right hand of power
[22:12] so God has declared through the son of
[22:15] man that you're going to see him after
[22:17] that you're going to see him sitting
[22:20] what on the right hand of power not and
[22:22] I'll let I'll read to you what brother
[22:23] Brown said it's not a right hand it's
[22:26] power and authority all right but now
[22:29] watch Jesus he had to go through stages
[22:31] he didn't say this at the first of his
[22:35] ministry he never said all power in
[22:37] Heaven and Earth has been given unto me
[22:38] until what till after even this but he's
[22:42] telling them Hereafter shall ye see the
[22:44] son of man sitting on the right hand of
[22:46] power coming in the Clouds Of Heaven now
[22:48] we know
[22:49] that being today he's really telling us
[22:52] about tell them about today amen coming
[22:54] in the Clouds Of Heaven all right now
[22:56] Mark 16 everybody reads mark 16 but
[22:59] watch and he said unto them go ye unto
[23:02] all the world and preach the gospel to
[23:03] Every Creature he that believeth in his
[23:05] baptized shall be saved but he that
[23:06] believeth not shall be damned and these
[23:09] signs shall follow them that believe in
[23:11] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[23:13] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[23:15] take up serpents and if they drink any
[23:17] deadly thing it shall not hn them they
[23:19] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[23:20] shall
[23:21] recover all right so then after the Lord
[23:24] had spoken unto them he was received up
[23:27] into heaven and sat on the right hand of
[23:31] God everybody got that all right so now
[23:34] let's go to Matthew
[23:37] 28:18 through
[23:40] 20 now this is after what this is this
[23:43] is after the uh death burri and
[23:46] Resurrection this is the 30 40 days he's
[23:47] getting ready to leave all right and
[23:49] Jesus came and spake unto them saying
[23:51] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[23:53] in Earth go ye therefore and teach all
[23:55] na now why didn't he say he was going to
[23:56] do
[23:57] that
[23:59] why didn't he say he was going to do
[24:03] that cuz I mean if he had all power in
[24:05] Heaven and Earth given under me then I'm
[24:07] going to do
[24:08] it God don't God doesn't work that way
[24:11] he knew he was going up and he was
[24:14] coming back just about 50 days later or
[24:17] 10 days later I mean and he was going
[24:19] into a group of people and they were
[24:20] going to do this go ye therefore and
[24:23] teach All Nations baptizing in the name
[24:25] of the father and of the son and of the
[24:26] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[24:28] things whatsoever I have commanded you
[24:31] right and lo I am with you all way even
[24:33] until the end of the world Amen now that
[24:37] was the word made dust but that word
[24:39] made dust had become glorified that word
[24:41] made flesh is now glorified flesh amen
[24:45] is that all right now he wasn't
[24:47] glorified flesh before he died right
[24:50] amen cuz that's why he said here after
[24:53] you'll see the son of man right sitting
[24:55] on the right hand of God coming in the
[24:57] Clouds Of Glory so you got that all
[24:59] right we got that part now what we want
[25:01] to do is we want to show you and and
[25:04] look at this it's really it's really
[25:05] neat how the book of Acts let's go to
[25:08] Acts chapter 7 verse 52 and then we'll
[25:11] read some quotes here in a
[25:12] minute but remember the right hand you
[25:16] never as far as I can see in the Bible
[25:19] you never see a scene of of of
[25:24] anyone standing on the right hand or
[25:26] sitting on the right hand of God it
[25:28] except after the death Buren
[25:31] resurrection and Ascension of
[25:33] Jesus oh sure they prophesied in the Old
[25:36] Testament we read it Heaven is my Throne
[25:38] Earth is my foot stol but that's really
[25:41] that's not saying exactly what he said
[25:43] he said you will see the son of man
[25:46] sitting on the right hand of God with
[25:48] all power and authority all right so
[25:50] it's got to be connected some way I see
[25:52] with a glorified
[25:55] body to me really just y'all can go to
[25:57] sleep now the glorified body is the
[25:59] right hand of
[26:00] God yall ready to go home
[26:03] sir well you can go to sleep if you want
[26:05] to but that's what struck me but you're
[26:08] going to see that when we get over into
[26:09] the Book of Revelations we're going to
[26:11] see how that that just ties perfect with
[26:13] the bride I'd never seen it before till
[26:15] the other day and it's just a real
[26:17] simple scripture we read all the time
[26:19] which of the prophets have not your
[26:20] fathers persecuted they have SL now who
[26:23] is this this is stepen the Bible says
[26:25] full of the Holy Ghost y'all come on in
[26:29] I don't see your daddy I see your mama
[26:32] this is Brother Louis's you you've met
[26:34] his his sisters but that's his mother
[26:36] coming in the back looks more like his
[26:41] sister looks more like his sister than
[26:44] does now his daddy looks like an older
[26:46] brother than than than the dad so bless
[26:49] luis's heart I told that brother I
[26:51] prayed for him big
[26:56] time that's all right
[26:59] so acts 7:52 this is
[27:02] Stephen we wait till your dad gets
[27:06] here okay which are the prophets now
[27:09] this is stepen he's preaching full of
[27:10] the Holy Ghost and brother brandham if
[27:12] you we'll read in a minute brother
[27:13] brandham says now this is not a prophet
[27:16] he's not even a preacher he was a deacon
[27:19] in the
[27:20] church what he said this is the Steven
[27:22] was a deacon in the church well the
[27:23] Deacon in the church is fixing to let
[27:26] these people have it cuz he was full of
[27:28] the Holy Ghost which of the prophets
[27:30] have not your fathers persecuted and
[27:32] they have slain them which showed before
[27:33] of the coming of the just one of whom
[27:35] you have been now the betrayers and
[27:38] murderers W he's talking to the Baptists
[27:41] and methodists and
[27:42] Pentecostals
[27:44] hello it's exactly who he's talking to
[27:47] who have received the law by the
[27:49] disposition of angels and have not kept
[27:51] it when they heard these things they
[27:54] were cut to the heart and they nashed on
[27:55] him with their teeth but he being full
[27:57] of the Holy ghost looked up steadfastly
[27:59] into heaven and saw the glory of God and
[28:02] Jesus standing on the right hand of God
[28:05] right you notice he's
[28:06] standing okay brother
[28:09] Lis acts
[28:23] 7:55 amen so acts 7:55 he being full of
[28:26] the Holy Ghost looked up steadfast saw
[28:28] all the glory of God Jesus standing on
[28:29] the right hand of God all right then and
[28:32] oh and 7:56 and said
[28:37] behold I see the heavens
[28:40] open now up here at the top it says he
[28:43] saw J and Jesus standing on the right
[28:44] hand of God you see
[28:47] that but now the Bible watch it comes
[28:50] down here to that next
[28:51] verse and identifies who the man
[28:55] is that's God in human flesh
[29:00] glorified okay and the son of man
[29:02] standing on the right hand of
[29:05] God and to Sav read and the rest of it
[29:08] we know what
[29:09] happened they killed
[29:11] him amen they stoned him and he fell
[29:14] asleep the prophet of God said he didn't
[29:15] even feel
[29:18] it amen so here we
[29:21] see the first martyr of of of the um of
[29:25] the church age or the age
[29:30] and when he's getting ready to die he
[29:31] sees Jesus
[29:35] glorified amen amen he sees Jesus in a
[29:38] glorified
[29:40] body and he's
[29:43] standing watch
[29:46] this let's go to the first quote this
[29:52] is from the infallibility of God's
[29:55] spoken word Chicago
[29:57] 1956
[30:02] I'm going to read I'm going to read the
[30:04] first paragraph and then you read it
[30:06] little old Steven was dying Jesus had
[30:09] been glorified sitting up there at the
[30:12] right hand of the majesty and they began
[30:14] to beat him with stones and his head was
[30:15] being mashed in with stones Steven
[30:17] looked steadfast toward Heaven Jesus
[30:19] after he finished his work that's
[30:22] important after he finished his work had
[30:25] sat down at the right hand of God right
[30:50] but stepen he saw Heavens open and Jesus
[30:53] standing at the right hand of God I
[30:55] guess the Savior must have stood up from
[30:58] his throne and give the Martyr a welcome
[31:13] in amen he saw the Everlasting Dominion
[31:17] of God
[31:22] above you know Steven was the first one
[31:24] to go into the sixth
[31:26] dimension
[31:29] as far as as far as the sixth Dimension
[31:31] we
[31:34] know John the Baptist John the Baptist
[31:37] and all those but Steven was the first
[31:39] one with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[31:40] to be
[31:46] martyred that you see
[31:48] this now watch number two I'm building
[31:52] up to something here the resurrection of
[31:55] Jesus Chicago
[31:56] 1956
[32:00] cuz I want you to see something about
[32:02] what
[32:05] happened when Jesus went up to the right
[32:08] hand of the
[32:10] father there was something opened
[32:13] up amen there was something opened up so
[32:18] watch and God raised him up and put him
[32:20] so high above every Heaven seventh
[32:23] Dimension until he has to stoop over to
[32:25] look to Heaven that's what God did for
[32:28] him so if you want to be exalted humble
[32:30] yourself and if you exalt yourself
[32:32] you'll be brought down low go
[32:50] ahead and I think of him that when he
[32:52] had raised risen from the dead that
[32:54] morning that he was then had his own
[32:57] blood as high high priest and he went
[32:59] beyond the veils through every spear
[33:15] right Satan in times past had men
[33:18] blocked off from
[33:23] Heaven he could not get in contact with
[33:27] heaven
[33:30] but when Jesus took his blood the first
[33:32] Veil he rent was the veil of
[33:39] death and the veil of the Grave the veil
[33:41] of the temple then the veil of
[33:46] sickness the veil of fear and every Veil
[33:50] that there was and unveiled God to
[33:56] man
[33:59] went way in above the heavens of Heaven
[34:01] Was Seated on the right hand of God and
[34:03] sat down as a finished work that's
[34:11] right all above and there he opened up a
[34:14] channel that God used to come down
[34:16] through the corridors of heaven and talk
[34:18] to Mankind in the Garden of
[34:26] Eden
[34:29] that's why when we get into those
[34:31] Dimensions see I don't think there was
[34:33] any Dimensions until this until
[34:36] sin because Adam Adam Ruled the Earth
[34:40] with no limitation so he could travel
[34:43] like a thought there was no dimension
[34:45] for him to go in and out
[34:47] of but watch this and Satan by sin had
[34:50] blocked
[34:56] them but the Great high priest with his
[34:58] Anointed with his blood went through
[35:00] every Veil and ripped her open cleared
[35:02] out the sky again that God and man could
[35:04] be father and son and commune again with
[35:07] one
[35:18] another all the Patriots of the New
[35:20] Testament as they died for instance
[35:22] Steven when they were stoning him to
[35:26] death
[35:33] the veils were all open to his precious
[35:36] eyes filled with blood but he said as he
[35:38] knelt on the ground he said I see Heaven
[35:39] open and Jesus standing at the right
[35:42] hand of
[35:52] God so the word made flesh didn't come
[35:54] down here just to save our soul
[36:00] he opened every Veil all the way back
[36:04] up he brought the dimensions where we
[36:07] can
[36:09] understand and see God not just see him
[36:12] but understand
[36:14] him but we know that when Steven looked
[36:17] and saw Jesus standing on the right hand
[36:18] of
[36:24] God it probably wasn't going through his
[36:26] mind at the moment that that's a glorify
[36:27] that's the glorified
[36:31] man you see what I'm
[36:33] saying but he knew that he was his
[36:35] savior he called him Jesus he knew Jesus
[36:37] was
[36:39] there and then the Bible shows that the
[36:41] son of man standing at the right hand of
[36:43] the
[36:47] father so being that Jesus come to pick
[36:50] up a glor or pick up a human body
[36:56] d
[36:58] picking up that dust what he done though
[37:00] he opened everything back up as soon as
[37:02] he went back brother Larry when he went
[37:04] up he opened everything up that's why
[37:06] people if we don't understand
[37:16] this CU remember he got his glorified
[37:18] body
[37:22] here he got he didn't have to go to
[37:24] heaven to get
[37:26] body he got his glorified body right
[37:30] here whatever change he made it was
[37:33] changed right
[37:35] here amen so so and then he went
[37:39] there so there's no way that him being
[37:42] who he
[37:44] is could close anything
[37:47] up so now here we are in the end
[37:50] time we got to understand all
[37:53] this we got to understand where the
[37:55] connection
[37:56] is
[37:58] amen you love the
[38:00] Lord listen he died at Calvary he took
[38:03] away your sins but he
[38:09] absolutely put a claim on your
[38:13] body and he's got to do
[38:16] it he can't there's no other way around
[38:18] he's got to bring a glorified
[38:25] condition and the only way can do is
[38:27] through the word of
[38:30] God Amen we'll read a quote very
[38:33] last that if you're not in the word
[38:38] you amen you got to be in the word all
[38:40] the
[38:41] way amen amen all right now let's go to
[38:44] number
[38:45] three which is pal worm Locust
[38:52] caterpillar I'll read the whole thing
[38:54] the right hand of God where the Bible
[38:56] said I looked up and seen Jesus standing
[38:58] at the right hand of God Philip or
[38:59] Steven when he was stoned don't mean
[39:02] that God's got a right hand Jesus is
[39:05] standing up on top of her right hand it
[39:07] means that he's in the right hand of
[39:09] power and authority now watch what he
[39:10] goes to go
[39:26] ahead
[39:29] cuz brother Brandon brings the right
[39:30] hand of power and authority and then he
[39:31] reads the scripture all
[39:38] power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[39:46] me said Jesus he was in
[39:50] Authority amen amen all power in heaven
[39:53] Earth been given unto me God was in
[39:56] Christ the Bible said in him dwells the
[39:58] fullness of the godhead
[40:03] bodle now if that happen to him that's
[40:05] got to happen to
[40:08] us amen not as one person anymore but as
[40:12] a
[40:14] bride amen amen and and I want you to
[40:17] see something when we get to
[40:19] it number
[40:22] four it's the rising of the
[40:25] sun talking about the quickening of the
[40:29] spirit let's read the
[40:32] red now let's notice what it did on
[40:37] Steven Steven was full of quickening
[40:40] power go
[40:42] ahead wasn't that right see he was full
[40:44] of quickening
[40:46] power it didn't make him
[40:50] scared he said you stiff necks and
[40:52] uncircumcised and heart and ears you
[40:54] always resist the Holy
[40:56] Ghost
[41:00] like your fathers did so do
[41:04] you which one of the prophets that
[41:06] showed forth the coming of the just one
[41:07] didn't your father
[41:12] Stone oh my done something to him sure
[41:15] he was full of quickening
[41:20] power and they said we'll get rid of
[41:22] that
[41:24] guy and when he died they stoned him in
[41:27] his poor little head the stones beating
[41:28] against it like
[41:33] that he looked up and said I see the
[41:35] heavens
[41:39] open quickening power was
[41:42] working I see the heavens open and Jesus
[41:45] standing at the right hand of
[41:48] God that's what's quickening power done
[41:51] for
[41:53] Steven amen it opened up a
[41:56] way now as we
[41:58] look we know that he was looking in
[42:01] another dimension
[42:03] amen he was look in another
[42:07] dimension and by Revelation he knew he
[42:09] was going to that
[42:13] place amen amen but you have to remember
[42:16] though
[42:19] that that when he got
[42:21] there he didn't see
[42:24] Jesus according to brother brandham see
[42:27] Jesus
[42:28] either right he didn't see Jesus either
[42:32] he said where is Jesus he said he's a
[42:33] little
[42:37] higher he was in the seventh Dimension
[42:41] with that's why I tell you when we when
[42:44] we come to that
[42:47] condition
[42:49] listen seventh Dimension is the
[42:51] glorified
[42:54] body nobody's reached it but one person
[42:56] right
[43:00] but we're going to have to reach it down
[43:04] here that's what's got to bring that
[43:07] sixth Dimension
[43:09] here bring
[43:12] them it'll be an automatic
[43:15] process it's not something that we're
[43:17] going to have to go now let's get the
[43:19] sixth Dimension now let's get
[43:25] this no when that glorified condition
[43:28] comes into
[43:30] here it's got to bring the sixth

[43:34] it not going to bring the
[43:36] fifth God's not

[44:15] word so you and I got to be the same
[44:19] thing the word made flesh in this
[44:23] hour for the time that we're
[44:26] living

[50:40] dying you say no my enemy is um Arthur
[50:46] arthritis no that's not your enemy your
[50:49] enemy is
[50:52] death all that takes you to
[50:55] death and hey we've had people 25 years
[50:59] old fall over dead
[51:01] so it's not the
[51:04] symptoms that last enemy is
[51:07] death and watch where he plants it he
[51:09] plants it on
[51:12] Earth amen amen Heaven is my Throne
[51:16] Earth is my foot stol amen that's the
[51:20] connection when God and man became one
[51:22] that's exactly what he
[51:25] did
[51:27] he put all that under his
[51:30] feet but it's not going to be made known
[51:32] until the end
[51:34] time
[51:36] to amen amen till I make sit down at my
[51:40] right hand listen we're going to
[51:42] actually fulfill that
[51:48] scripture sit down at my right
[51:51] hand until I make thine
[51:54] enemies so who's doing it
[51:57] you or him him he's doing it not you
[52:02] he's doing
[52:03] it Psalms
[52:09] 1386 though the Lord be high yet ha he
[52:12] respect unto the lowly but the proud he
[52:15] knoweth far
[52:21] off though I walk in the midst of
[52:25] trouble thou will revive
[52:27] me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand
[52:30] against the wrath of mine
[52:34] enemies and thy right hand shall save
[52:39] me amen amen but see we look say oh
[52:43] that's my soul that's your
[52:46] body body's talking
[52:49] about sure he came to clean the soul
[52:52] sure he came to
[52:53] bring but he had to open that way just
[52:56] like he did for
[52:59] Steven so that remember he said the
[53:02] world shall see me no
[53:05] more now listen the world saw this
[53:09] Jesus as being preached 2,000 years
[53:13] ago remember the prophet of God telling
[53:15] us that they couldn't get him off the
[53:19] cross but thank God a prophet
[53:23] came off put in
[53:26] amen he brought him
[53:30] off remember remember it's out of and
[53:35] into amen he brought that man off the
[53:38] cross he said that man is here
[53:41] now to do what he's supposed to
[53:44] do amen
[53:46] amen Romans 8:33 now watch Paul pick it
[53:49] up
[53:53] R Who Shall lay anything to the ch
[53:56] charge of God's
[54:00] elect it is God that
[54:03] justify who is he that
[54:06] condemneth it is Christ that died ye
[54:08] rather that is risen
[54:12] again who is even at the right hand of
[54:15] God who also maketh intercession for
[54:22] us amen amen that intercessory work just
[54:25] does not include your
[54:30] soul listen
[54:32] amen he knew your body was going to be
[54:35] rotten it's not a
[54:38] mistake or a he didn't have to have a
[54:41] crisis meeting in heaven
[54:43] when when we fell in
[54:46] flesh we had
[54:49] to cuz he always wanted to be in
[54:53] flesh don't you see this he didn't want
[54:56] to be
[55:00] MDC MDC delivered a
[55:03] message but MDC didn't save
[55:08] Abraham when MDC came over into Jesus
[55:12] Christ the same
[55:15] person and was born a
[55:18] baby just like you and
[55:20] me then
[55:22] now the Kinsman can do his job
[55:29] and that's what you know and
[55:31] really we say oh well he did the Kinsman
[55:34] work and bought
[55:38] me but but but but not my
[55:44] body when Boaz raised that
[55:48] shoe the Bible says
[55:51] all all that Naomi
[55:54] had Naomi had was
[55:58] and he even got a bride out of
[56:00] it amen and restored her
[56:03] back amen amen so the
[56:08] story like I said you you see these
[56:10] layers in the
[56:14] Bible and I was telling him this morning
[56:16] you know as a baby you see things a
[56:17] little different than you
[56:22] do a baby would see that they'd have to
[56:25] crawl up the St
[56:29] and it would seem like Stone
[56:34] Mountain but now look I'm older this is
[56:38] nothing until I get real
[56:42] older then it goes back to the way it
[56:44] was
[56:45] before it becomes a mountain
[56:48] again but you understand what I'm saying
[56:51] things we see as a
[56:53] babies the same thing we see now is in a
[56:56] different
[56:59] way that's why the layers of the Eternal
[57:01] Word of God that's the
[57:06] layers remember Paul says he says he
[57:08] said I I spake as a
[57:11] child in other words I ate baby
[57:16] food but now what did he say he said
[57:19] leave
[57:20] those there's more to
[57:23] eat there's more there's more meat but
[57:26] it's not that we took this Bible and
[57:28] throw it away and then brought another
[57:29] one
[57:33] in listen if this is the Eternal Word of
[57:35] God and I'm asking you that
[57:38] question these 66
[57:41] books are going to last for an
[57:44] eternity there's got to be layers
[57:46] brother Larry that we don't even
[57:49] see got to be things that we will not
[57:52] see down here that we'll see
[57:54] there but they still a lot more down
[57:56] here that we need to see
[58:01] here but as a baby you see things
[58:04] different but as we grow
[58:07] up now we've come to the place to where
[58:09] everything we
[58:12] see should be focused on that Ministry
[58:15] of the son of
[58:17] man because that's what changed Jesus's
[58:21] body nothing else not another word
[58:24] changed his body except that three and a
[58:27] half year Ministry of Jesus Christ the
[58:29] son of man on
[58:36] Earth amen so why are we looking to find
[58:38] it from somebody some great this one or
[58:40] great that
[58:43] one lay
[58:45] here laying right
[58:48] here amen amen we just got to start
[58:50] looking at it with
[58:53] eyes of a more mature person
[58:57] amen amen you love the
[59:00] Lord now what we're looking
[59:03] at is that we're going to go now Into
[59:05] the Book of
[59:07] Revelations because it talks about a
[59:09] throne there in Revelations
[59:13] 3 but now let's not forget the right
[59:16] hand of
[59:18] power because to me that's speaking of a
[59:21] glorified body that was a glorified
[59:22] Jesus standing in that
[59:25] scene
[59:28] is that all right amen that was a
[59:31] glorified Jesus standing there with a
[59:32] glorified
[59:35] body and keep in your mind when he comes
[59:37] to John on
[59:43] patmas how'd he
[59:45] come let's
[59:48] read Revelations 320 behold I stand at
[59:51] the door and
[59:55] knock
[59:56] if if any man hear my voice and open the
[59:58] door I will come in with him and St with
[1:00:00] him and he with
[1:00:05] me to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:00:08] to sit with me in my
[1:00:12] throne even as I also overcame and am
[1:00:16] sat down with my father in his
[1:00:21] throne he that has an ear let him hear
[1:00:23] what the spirit
[1:00:24] sayth
[1:00:26] to the churches all right let's go to
[1:00:28] number five read what brother Brown says
[1:00:30] and we'll make a few
[1:00:32] comments 1963 how can I overcome
[1:00:35] Jeffersonville
[1:00:38] Indiana indana I like the way brother
[1:00:41] Brown takes some of them Ai and use
[1:00:45] out do you notice the
[1:00:47] arrangement ain't no way in front of
[1:00:49] that he's a southerner to the
[1:00:52] core him and Paul talk just the same
[1:00:58] all right did you notice the arrangement
[1:01:00] of that
[1:01:01] see set with me in yeah you can read
[1:01:03] that the minute sit with me in my Throne
[1:01:05] not on my
[1:01:14] throne in my Throne that is that's in
[1:01:23] hisain now hold on a minute Jesus
[1:01:26] doesn't have a
[1:01:30] domain except you and
[1:01:33] me oh yeah we're going to a
[1:01:36] city but Jesus told us he said the
[1:01:39] Tabernacle you're looking for is
[1:01:43] you he said it's in you amen the
[1:01:47] Tabernacle we're looking for is not
[1:01:48] somewhere out under the
[1:01:52] building that was a temporary place
[1:01:56] the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a
[1:01:58] temporary
[1:02:01] place the three
[1:02:03] stages amen amen Body Spirit and
[1:02:08] soul inner Court holy
[1:02:12] H
[1:02:14] amen that was a type Moses went to
[1:02:17] heaven brother Brown said and saw Jesus
[1:02:19] saw the
[1:02:21] city come back and wrote down what he
[1:02:24] saw and that's the way they lived
[1:02:28] it until Jesus
[1:02:31] said I'm him I'm the
[1:02:34] Tabernacle I'm the one you've been
[1:02:36] looking
[1:02:37] for I was veiled behind Badger skins you
[1:02:40] couldn't see
[1:02:41] me but now I'm veiled in human
[1:02:45] flesh so that you can see
[1:02:47] me but you took the you took the curtain
[1:02:50] and sewed it back
[1:02:53] up they'd rather seen the badger skin
[1:02:56] than the flesh
[1:02:59] skin that's the same thing now everybody
[1:03:01] wants to go back to their
[1:03:04] traditions and not see the real God made
[1:03:07] manifest in me and
[1:03:09] you in my Throne that's in his
[1:03:15] domain and now as Christ is the ruler
[1:03:18] Throne ruler at this
[1:03:24] time of the complete domain of
[1:03:29] God nothing left
[1:03:31] out nothing left out the complete domain
[1:03:34] of
[1:03:35] God so will the church be with
[1:03:40] him the bride be with him in his
[1:03:44] throne in the entire
[1:03:48] domain see not on my
[1:03:52] throne but in my
[1:03:54] Throne see where his domain
[1:03:58] reaches a throne is over a
[1:04:02] domain and a domain reaches just as far
[1:04:05] as its boundaries
[1:04:08] does this one is from eternity to
[1:04:12] ET just think of that amen from eternity
[1:04:16] to
[1:04:18] Eternity all the kings and England they
[1:04:20] had this great
[1:04:24] domain but there was an end of it
[1:04:28] because somebody else took another
[1:04:31] part not in this one this is from
[1:04:34] eternity to
[1:04:36] Eternity so to sit on the throne would
[1:04:39] not be
[1:04:41] correct but in that
[1:04:44] Throne so everything in that
[1:04:47] Throne the whole domain mine and
[1:04:50] yours and that's what we're looking at
[1:04:53] the end
[1:04:54] time
[1:04:56] amen amen it has no boundaries what the
[1:05:01] problem with the church ages there were
[1:05:06] boundaries Luther went from here to
[1:05:09] Here
[1:05:11] Right Wesley went from here to here
[1:05:15] Wesley amen Pentecost went from here to
[1:05:19] here they stopped but God kept
[1:05:23] moving that's why the prophet God had to
[1:05:28] preach the seals and all the great
[1:05:34] Revelations and not to be sacrilegious
[1:05:36] but he opened up that same
[1:05:39] portal that he opened up for
[1:05:43] St to see to see Jesus standing on the
[1:05:46] right hand of the father in
[1:05:49] glory amen that's where the Prophet went
[1:05:54] now remember
[1:05:56] he saw a
[1:05:57] vision this is not a
[1:06:00] vision pinch yourself remember my
[1:06:03] brother when he when he have a
[1:06:05] vision first thing he' do is he' pinch
[1:06:08] himself remember he pinch to see if I'm
[1:06:11] in this
[1:06:13] world and sometimes he wouldn't say that
[1:06:15] he knew he was in this
[1:06:19] Dimension no see how perfect even a
[1:06:22] prophet God letting him go across a
[1:06:24] curtain of time
[1:06:31] not one part of that flesh
[1:06:34] went he said I looked back and I saw my
[1:06:37] arm
[1:06:42] Moving Out of Body Experience whatever
[1:06:44] you want to call
[1:06:46] it but when he went across that curtain
[1:06:49] those people were
[1:06:53] real they hugged his neck
[1:06:57] amen amen he was just as real as they
[1:06:59] were real on that
[1:07:01] side but body
[1:07:04] with his body had to rest in
[1:07:09] Hope until
[1:07:12] what until
[1:07:15] what until you and I connect
[1:07:19] somewhere we got to connect back to
[1:07:22] that Jesus did not just come to save
[1:07:25] your
[1:07:27] Soul he came to save
[1:07:30] everything cuz he's taking it right back
[1:07:33] with
[1:07:36] him that's why that the false revelation
[1:07:41] of the of the denominations about
[1:07:42] getting a brand another
[1:07:45] body bre in the Bible there's no way
[1:07:49] stand on the right hand of the
[1:07:52] father I mean that's just as well to us
[1:07:54] it's simple but to them it would be
[1:07:57] profound but thank God he showed it to
[1:08:01] us God he brought it to a little
[1:08:03] man that told
[1:08:06] us I'm going to raise in that
[1:08:11] body Redemption is not
[1:08:15] replacement
[1:08:17] amen sure it's going to be made
[1:08:20] new just like this Earth is going to not
[1:08:23] be
[1:08:24] destroyed going to be burned
[1:08:26] off and made
[1:08:28] new amen you'll be changed in your
[1:08:32] atom the first set atoms your mom and
[1:08:34] daddy
[1:08:36] gave that's what's killing
[1:08:39] you but being changed in our
[1:08:42] atoms to have a body like his glor
[1:08:45] body if Steven could have had a real
[1:08:47] good Revelation he said I'm going have a
[1:08:49] body just like
[1:08:53] that I'm going have a body just like
[1:08:56] that but what was his Revelation that
[1:08:58] that was Jesus standing on the power and
[1:09:00] authority of
[1:09:04] God everybody all right say
[1:09:07] Amen let's go through this real slow for
[1:09:10] a second let's go to Revelations one
[1:09:13] brother D has told us many times that
[1:09:15] Revelation is our
[1:09:17] book the book of the
[1:09:20] bride
[1:09:22] bride if John typed the bride everything
[1:09:25] John went through we're going to go
[1:09:30] through
[1:09:32] amen Revelations 10 God told him to eat
[1:09:35] the
[1:09:38] book amen and he ate the book so you and
[1:09:41] I have to eat the
[1:09:43] book but I want you to watch this now
[1:09:46] keep in your mind remember what I said
[1:09:48] John tops the
[1:09:50] bride the right hand of power is the
[1:09:52] glorified
[1:09:54] condition
[1:09:56] is that all right you okay so now let's
[1:09:59] read and see where let's see where this
[1:10:01] thing's
[1:10:03] transferred and in the midst of the
[1:10:05] seven candlesticks one lik un to the son
[1:10:07] of man clothed with a garment down to
[1:10:10] the foot and G about the PS with a
[1:10:12] golden
[1:10:21] girdle amen amen bride form
[1:10:28] a man doesn't have
[1:10:33] PS a girl has
[1:10:37] PS amen amen so it's a feminist
[1:10:42] form that John was looking
[1:10:46] at is that all right say Amen hey I told
[1:10:49] him this
[1:10:50] morning
[1:10:52] listen say it again
[1:10:55] sing sounds like
[1:10:59] German J you wait
[1:11:02] okay
[1:11:05] scooching pay
[1:11:06] attention I told him I said I'm 57 I'm
[1:11:09] hard to hearing you going have to amen
[1:11:10] real loud for me to hear
[1:11:14] you all right now watch here we are in
[1:11:17] the Book of Revelations the bride's
[1:11:20] book and in the midst of the seven
[1:11:22] candlesticks One locking into the son of
[1:11:23] man this what John sees
[1:11:31] what he sees GED by PS with a golden
[1:11:36] girdle his head and his hair was whiteed
[1:11:39] like
[1:11:43] wool and what does that show judgment
[1:11:46] his Wi
[1:11:48] on cuz
[1:11:50] listen I was thinking about this
[1:11:51] yesterday we as the
[1:11:54] bride we don't judge up
[1:11:58] there the Bible said the books were
[1:12:03] open and were judged out of that
[1:12:07] book so where is the
[1:12:10] Judgment what's written down goes on
[1:12:13] here this is the
[1:12:15] Judgment that's why that we take he took
[1:12:18] on our
[1:12:20] judgment if you'll ever see that then
[1:12:22] you'll know you are
[1:12:24] sinless
[1:12:26] and that's why we don't have to go to
[1:12:28] judgment because our book is
[1:12:29] [Music]
[1:12:34] blank when he tries to even open the
[1:12:37] book it's a blank
[1:12:41] page cuz we're so wrapped up in
[1:12:44] Christ if he gets a white
[1:12:47] page we get a white
[1:12:50] page oh we haven't listen we think we
[1:12:52] know a lot we a't tapped
[1:12:58] all right here we go let's get done and
[1:13:00] his feet was likeing toine brass as if
[1:13:01] they burn in a
[1:13:06] furnace and his voice is the sound of
[1:13:08] many
[1:13:10] Waters now what is Waters people okay
[1:13:13] all right people he was in the people
[1:13:16] hello and he had in his right hand Seven
[1:13:21] Stars what I tell you the right hand
[1:13:25] look your glorified body he said all
[1:13:27] them seven ain't glorified hang on a
[1:13:32] minute and he had in his right hand
[1:13:34] Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a
[1:13:36] sharp two-edged
[1:13:40] sword the word they
[1:13:45] preached amen Amen
[1:13:50] brother
[1:13:54] okay
[1:13:55] [Laughter]
[1:13:57] [Applause]
[1:13:59] I'm just
[1:14:02] okay and his countenance was as the sun
[1:14:06] shineth in his
[1:14:11] strength now this is the part that I
[1:14:14] that this may not bother you a
[1:14:17] bit but I just start beating my poor old
[1:14:20] chair to
[1:14:23] death when I saw him who's him who came
[1:14:28] to John on
[1:14:30] pmes Jesus glorified
[1:14:34] Jesus glorify
[1:14:37] Jesus I fell at his feet is
[1:14:41] dead and he laid his right hand upon
[1:14:47] me saying unto me fear
[1:14:50] not I am the
[1:14:52] first and the last
[1:14:56] I'm going to glorify the first
[1:14:58] one and I'm going to glorify
[1:15:01] the he laid his right hand upon
[1:15:05] me
[1:15:08] power the right hand of
[1:15:12] Fellowship in other words he's saying
[1:15:15] look the power I have is I'm
[1:15:20] glorified now John fear not so are you
[1:15:27] John the
[1:15:30] full here John this is why I'm going to
[1:15:34] do
[1:15:35] it because the whole
[1:15:37] bride first to the
[1:15:39] last going to get a glorified
[1:15:42] body amen and they're going to get it
[1:15:44] right
[1:15:45] here right here I am he that liveth in
[1:15:49] was dead and behold I'm alive forever
[1:15:53] more and the two things we fear the
[1:15:58] worse hell and
[1:16:02] death I think we may have the keys
[1:16:06] to I don't think he's I don't think the
[1:16:08] devil's got
[1:16:10] them and if Jesus has transferred

[1:18:12] key of death in hell then you can take
[1:18:13] Steven's part of death
[1:18:19] out if you take St part of death out
[1:18:21] then we've got that opening that goes
[1:18:23] right up to the throne
[1:18:30] right amen now in Revelations
[1:18:38] 5 Revelations
[1:18:43] 5 and i beheld l in the midst of the
[1:18:45] Throne of the four beasts in the midst
[1:18:46] of the elders stood a lamb as they had
[1:18:48] been
[1:18:53] slain
[1:18:56] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:18:58] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:19:00] into all the
[1:19:06] Earth and he came and took the
[1:19:09] book now what is the
[1:19:13] book
[1:19:15] you you are that
[1:19:18] book Christ took out of the right
[1:19:23] hand right
[1:19:25] of him that sat upon the
[1:19:29] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:19:31] The Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders fell
[1:19:33] down before the
[1:19:40] lamb having every one of them Harps and
[1:19:42] golden vows full of odors which are the
[1:19:44] prayers of
[1:19:49] who and they sang a new song saying thou
[1:19:52] worthy to take the
[1:19:53] book
[1:19:58] and open the seals
[1:19:59] thereof for thou was slain and has
[1:20:02] redeemed us to
[1:20:05] God by thy
[1:20:07] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[1:20:09] and people and
[1:20:12] nation and hath made
[1:20:15] us unto our God Kings and
[1:20:19] Priests we shall re on the
[1:20:23] earth that is a physical
[1:20:26] Reign but he's first got to R in the
[1:20:33] earth amen now how you going to do
[1:20:37] that last quote and then we'll be done
[1:20:40] hope it didn't bore
[1:20:42] you Lise took too
[1:20:46] long I'm just humbling myself yeah I
[1:20:50] know you're doing good buddy it seems
[1:20:53] like we've done this all day day we
[1:20:56] have listen watch this lay of say in
[1:20:59] church age watch brother Brown watch him
[1:21:00] just laser this thing
[1:21:04] in now then there will not be one person
[1:21:07] who will sit in the Throne of the Lord
[1:21:10] Jesus unless he has been living that
[1:21:18] word all right swallow this
[1:21:21] one your prayers your fasting your
[1:21:24] repentance
[1:21:28] no matter what you present to God none
[1:21:30] of that will gain you the privilege of
[1:21:32] sitting in that
[1:21:37] Throne
[1:21:40] brother but he gave us an
[1:21:43] out it will be granted only to the word
[1:21:49] Bride As The Throne of the king is
[1:21:51] shared with the queen because she is
[1:21:53] United to
[1:22:00] him so only they who are of that word
[1:22:03] even as he is of that word will share
[1:22:05] that
[1:22:11] Throne remember we have shown clearly
[1:22:13] All Through the Ages that even as Adam
[1:22:15] and Eve
[1:22:20] fell because they left the
[1:22:23] word so the Ephesian age fell by turning
[1:22:26] slightly from the
[1:22:31] word until with every age continuing to
[1:22:34] turn
[1:22:37] away we have a final repudiation of the
[1:22:40] word by the World Church
[1:22:46] system this Lan age ends in a blackout
[1:22:50] of the
[1:22:53] word
[1:22:55] thereby sorry thereby causing a
[1:22:57] departure of the Lord from the
[1:23:01] midst he stands outside calling to his
[1:23:04] own who follow him by the obedience to
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:10] word after a short and Powerful
[1:23:12] demonstration of the
[1:23:16] spirit this little hund and persecuted
[1:23:18] group will go to be with
[1:23:23] Jesus so there's the prescription right
[1:23:26] there you're going to be in the word all
[1:23:28] the
[1:23:31] way because remember the Ephesian Church
[1:23:35] barely missed
[1:23:37] it but they're waiting for
[1:23:40] someone and even as Steven was
[1:23:43] looking looking into another
[1:23:46] dimension he saw Jesus standing at the
[1:23:48] right hand of the authority of
[1:23:52] power he was dying
[1:23:56] same way with me and
[1:23:57] you as we
[1:24:00] die
[1:24:01] physical as we
[1:24:03] die as we die to
[1:24:06] ourselves what opens
[1:24:08] up cuz look we
[1:24:12] know we know we're going to get a
[1:24:14] city we going get a man we know we're
[1:24:18] going to have a m we know we're going to
[1:24:21] have a a
[1:24:22] honeymoon we know going to have a
[1:24:24] thousand year
[1:24:25] Millennial we know we're going to live
[1:24:27] for an
[1:24:29] eternity but we're still living
[1:24:31] here s Gail what's going to get us from
[1:24:33] here
[1:24:35] today it's the opening just like with
[1:24:38] Steven as he was the first
[1:24:40] Marty and God opened that portal for him
[1:24:43] to
[1:24:44] see I believe brother Brandon was same
[1:24:47] way he was able to see into that
[1:24:49] Dimension but not leave him
[1:24:52] there he brought to re reation of the
[1:24:54] son of man back
[1:24:57] here that right hand of power is not
[1:24:59] coming it's
[1:25:02] here still
[1:25:05] hurt that's what I was telling them this
[1:25:07] morning I said are you going to believe
[1:25:08] to see or see to
[1:25:13] believe if you see to believe you're an
[1:25:18] unbeliever if I if I say oh I wish
[1:25:20] brother Lis was
[1:25:23] here
[1:25:26] brother L don't talk to about me talk
[1:25:28] about yourself you interpret it just
[1:25:31] right thank you I don't have to believe
[1:25:34] he's he's
[1:25:37] coming I don't have to I don't have to
[1:25:39] believe
[1:25:42] anymore do you he's
[1:25:46] here amen that's our problem we're
[1:25:49] trying to wait till we see it before we
[1:25:51] believe
[1:25:53] it
[1:25:54] Believers believe before he's even
[1:25:59] here same thing with God God has been
[1:26:02] here the whole time that's what I
[1:26:03] telling him this
[1:26:05] morning he's been here the whole
[1:26:07] time what we does is he tries to open
[1:26:10] the
[1:26:11] door we shut
[1:26:14] it and actually we took the knob off the
[1:26:21] outside you have to you have to open a
[1:26:23] door and like brother Dale said just
[1:26:24] like that quote you got to go
[1:26:28] out you got to go out to him that's
[1:26:31] exactly what we got to do we got to go
[1:26:33] out rededicate ourselves reconsecrate
[1:26:37] ourselves study more pray
[1:26:42] more do a little bit of the work
[1:26:45] yourself and listen it's like I told him
[1:26:47] this
[1:26:48] morning it's good to be a
[1:26:51] baby but it's not good to stay a baby
[1:26:55] not good to stay a baby what if we all
[1:26:57] would have been one year
[1:27:02] old number one we'd have a lot of
[1:27:04] confusion
[1:27:06] today we'd have to feed
[1:27:08] you change your
[1:27:11] diaper but no we've grown up we know
[1:27:13] what to do know
[1:27:16] toat we should know what to do with
[1:27:19] ourselves we should conduct ourselves in
[1:27:21] a
[1:27:23] manner pleasing to God amen amen to get
[1:27:27] out of here Steven was so full of the
[1:27:29] Holy
[1:27:32] Ghost if he saw Jesus Christ standing on
[1:27:34] the right hand of the
[1:27:36] father all glory and
[1:27:38] power brothers and sisters he's not
[1:27:41] there
[1:27:42] anymore he's right here he's in me and
[1:27:47] you but it's got to come from the word
[1:27:49] out you got to eat that
[1:27:53] word
[1:27:54] and it's okay to be a
[1:27:57] baby but 10
[1:27:59] years still a
[1:28:01] baby grow up all of us need to grow up
[1:28:05] need to grow up we all need to be more
[1:28:08] mature in
[1:28:09] God but you see how you you read
[1:28:14] something and you say well you know we
[1:28:16] know what brother B said about the power
[1:28:18] and
[1:28:19] authority right hand was the power and
[1:28:21] authority of
[1:28:22] God but never seen that that had to be
[1:28:25] the only time that was ever spoken is
[1:28:27] when Jesus was standing there the
[1:28:28] glorified
[1:28:32] body and when he was getting ready to
[1:28:34] leave
[1:28:35] here he said
[1:28:38] Hereafter you're going to see the son of
[1:28:41] man you know what he was saying he said
[1:28:43] in other words you're either going to
[1:28:45] get a revelation to me
[1:28:47] now you're going to stand before me
[1:28:51] there cuz remember he's going to you're
[1:28:53] going to stand before the son of
[1:28:57] remember the son of man had power to
[1:29:01] forgive and he even gave that power to
[1:29:04] you he said whoever sins you retain they
[1:29:06] retain whoever sins you remit they
[1:29:13] remit you and
[1:29:15] I you and I understand more of the
[1:29:19] flesh then we should ever understand
[1:29:21] about it being connected to God
[1:29:26] that's what really got me when when when
[1:29:28] Jesus comes to John and lays his hand
[1:29:29] now
[1:29:33] look John felt that
[1:29:36] hand John felt that
[1:29:38] hand he put his right hand on John and
[1:29:41] says fear not
[1:29:43] John I'm the first and the
[1:29:47] last I started in your new
[1:29:50] birth I'm going to end it with a
[1:29:51] glorified
[1:29:53] life amen I'm going to end it with a
[1:29:55] glorified
[1:29:57] body and that's the Gap we got to fill
[1:29:59] in and that's what we as ministers and
[1:30:01] you as as Ley this is the
[1:30:08] time amen Paul said leaving the
[1:30:12] principles
[1:30:14] leaving not do away with but anyway
[1:30:22] leave let that be
[1:30:25] Foundation if you don't understand
[1:30:28] please come to Bible
[1:30:30] study ask
[1:30:34] questions don't be afraid I I'll be
[1:30:39] available to help brother Dale now to do

[1:30:45] questions please if you have questions
[1:30:47] you need
[1:30:48] ansers amen we need
[1:30:52] answers the question is is how we going
[1:30:54] to get from
[1:30:56] here to that glorified
[1:30:58] condition sister Anna that's what it's
[1:31:00] narrowed down
[1:31:02] to if you're born again and you've been
[1:31:04] baptized you got the Holy Ghost you're
[1:31:07] you're reading the
[1:31:09] word God's perfecting you through the
[1:31:12] word what else are we looking for Don't

[1:31:19] you better
[1:31:21] know you got to know
[1:31:24] because if you do know then you can
[1:31:25] progress on
[1:31:27] us if not you stay in the same
[1:31:31] place so that's what we have to look
[1:31:34] for the next thing coming is a
[1:31:37] resurrection and then people getting a
[1:31:39] glorified
