[19:52] okay
[19:53] Lord bless every one of you
[19:56] brother uh dick you okay
[19:58] you feeling better
[20:02] I am here okay all right
[20:04] just keep praying for brother dick I
[20:05] heard for him every time he walks off of
[20:07] that stage okay uh and truly I do
[20:11] I do a hurt for him I was uh
[20:14] watching somebody yesterday walk down
[20:17] the road
[20:19] um I went to get my license renewed or
[20:22] motorcycle license renewed and I was
[20:25] into calling this man gets out of a car
[20:26] and it must have been he must have been
[20:28] with his dad
[20:29] and his dad was probably in his 80s and
[20:32] and he had a cane in one hand in one of
[20:34] those
[20:35] three fingered things and the other
[20:37] other hand and he could just barely walk
[20:39] but you could see the generation of the
[20:41] dad and the and the Sun and you and when
[20:44] I see that I've grown because because I
[20:47] see that's what sin done
[20:50] that's what sin done sin has taken all
[20:53] of us taken these bodies and just broke
[20:55] them down and and you know it's uh we're
[20:58] going to talk about a little bit tonight
[20:59] but it's put a lot of people in Despair
[21:01] and and you know it's pain and suffering
[21:05] that we see in this world that that
[21:07] thank God we're not going to be around
[21:09] for the real pain and suffering when uh
[21:11] when the Rapture comes but uh
[21:14] it's going to happen and it's going to
[21:17] be a a harsh time but thank God he's
[21:19] going to take us out of that and uh put
[21:23] us into a
[21:25] into like we were talking in the back in
[21:27] an astronaut condition
[21:29] you know you can you can 300 people can
[21:32] ride in an airplane
[21:35] that's easy
[21:36] but only two or three can get in a
[21:38] spaceship
[21:40] only two or three because they're
[21:42] pressurized for the job there's not a
[21:44] big ship for pressurized for 300 and
[21:46] some people it's a small group of people
[21:48] fear not little flock so it's going to
[21:50] be the little flock that's going to be
[21:52] pressurized for the condition of the
[21:54] hour so good to be in the house of the
[21:56] Lord I want to tell you why we're at it
[21:59] that those of you that are going to The
[22:00] Father's Day
[22:02] um
[22:03] um camping trip next Thursday Friday and
[22:07] Saturday we need to meet Sunday
[22:09] afternoon after the second service just
[22:13] to get all of our ducks in a row this
[22:14] will be number five or six so we should
[22:16] kind of know what's going on but we
[22:18] really still need to know who's going to
[22:20] be there Thursday to help set up who's
[22:22] going to be there to cook who's going to
[22:23] be there to do these things because it
[22:25] should not be the burden of one person
[22:27] to do it all and it has not been
[22:28] everybody's helped and we've had a real
[22:31] real good time so after the second
[22:33] service we stand around talk for an hour
[22:36] anyway
[22:37] so let's meet for about 15 minutes
[22:39] downstairs just to make sure that we get
[22:41] our license and all those things so uh
[22:44] just keep us in your prayers those of
[22:46] you that are not going I wish you all
[22:47] would come uh I really wish you would
[22:50] come on Friday night just just to eat
[22:52] and fellowship with us that evening it
[22:55] would be I think it would be a joy to
[22:58] see the kids and and see the atmosphere
[23:01] of of what we do up there so just keep
[23:05] us in your prayers though if you got
[23:06] your Bibles let's turn to the Book of
[23:08] John
[23:09] and this is going to be kind of strange
[23:11] tonight but
[23:14] I'm a strange guy
[23:17] in light of thank you brother Chris in
[23:20] light of
[23:22] in light of things that have been going
[23:24] on you know around the message of the
[23:27] hour and the reason I made that analogy
[23:29] about the the spaceship versus the the
[23:31] airplane because uh the message people
[23:35] are going to start out by by millions
[23:37] and it's going to dwindle down to almost
[23:39] nothing
[23:40] that's just the way I see it and and in
[23:43] light of uh and tonight I'm going to
[23:45] call some names because if if they can
[23:48] go on YouTube and if they can voice
[23:50] their opinion and they can put it out to
[23:52] the world I'm going to call their name
[23:54] okay because it's something that I know
[23:58] this church is prepared for we've been
[24:00] pressurized but I I would I would
[24:05] suggest
[24:06] that you maybe go on YouTube and look up
[24:10] Jeff Jenkins
[24:12] and see what he's saying now that he's
[24:14] not a pastor of a message church and
[24:16] just see what he's saying
[24:18] about
[24:20] the things that are wrong and and the
[24:22] things that he has uh
[24:24] encountered and
[24:27] the brother just needs prayer
[24:29] he just needs prayer but but in light of
[24:32] the things that he's brought up I I've
[24:34] been thinking on this and even last
[24:36] Sunday downstairs this is going to
[24:38] connect with the Statue of a perfect man
[24:41] because actually brother Branham after
[24:42] he preached statue of a perfect man that
[24:44] morning he preached a god of my life
[24:46] that afternoon all right so I believe it
[24:49] was real fitting and then he preached
[24:50] Blasphemous names a couple of weeks
[24:52] after that to really solidify the statue
[24:54] of a perfect man but I believe it's one
[24:56] of the most ill-taught subjects is the
[24:59] statue of a perfect man
[25:01] and it's a requirement like brother Dale
[25:04] said and like even brother Brown said
[25:06] it's a requirement you're required to
[25:08] have these things and we'll read we'll
[25:10] read a quote about that in just a little
[25:11] while but
[25:12] here in John 16
[25:15] I want to thank you for your prayers the
[25:17] Miami trip went really well
[25:18] we had a couple of things happen that
[25:21] that was uh phenomenal and outstanding
[25:24] uh we had one sister that uh actually I
[25:27] was reading one uh Friday night I guess
[25:29] it was I read now to Acts 19 well I
[25:31] flipped the Bible open and there laid my
[25:33] prayer cloth and everybody was kind of
[25:36] looking on the front row and I explained
[25:38] to them that that's why we kept in Acts
[25:40] 19 we kept those prayer claws because
[25:41] that was from you know from Paul
[25:44] and after the service one sister comes
[25:46] up and she says I have a rash from she
[25:48] had it from here up to here see I've
[25:50] been having it for a long time so she
[25:52] said I'd like to have one of those
[25:53] prayer cloths I said sure not a problem
[25:54] so we laid the prayer cloth on her hand
[25:57] prayed gave her the prayer cloth well
[25:58] she came back the next night and it was
[26:01] gone
[26:01] so so we thank God for that we wanted to
[26:05] when we left we didn't say anything
[26:07] about it but I asked God I said perform
[26:09] a miracle just perform a miracle
[26:11] somewhere in the service just perform a
[26:14] miracle just to help the people and you
[26:16] know what helped me that I was there at
[26:18] the right time okay and then also we had
[26:21] uh we were in in the fellowship hall and
[26:25] a brother took a picture of me and
[26:27] another brother and there was a cloud
[26:30] that was
[26:33] shown behind us and it was really they
[26:36] rejoiced over it whether you know I I
[26:38] don't put a lot on that but but they did
[26:40] so so it really helped them understand
[26:43] that that maybe we were in the right
[26:46] place at the right time doing the right
[26:47] thing okay so it's just a Vindication
[26:49] for the people I knew I was
[26:52] but they have to know that that we were
[26:55] all in the same place together so it was
[26:57] a wonderful meeting we had a good time
[26:58] most of you know I lost my voice
[27:01] for about four or five days after that
[27:03] but it is back so you can either say oh
[27:06] me or praise God one or two
[27:08] but tonight
[27:09] we're gonna look at my guide
[27:12] and let's fire heads I love this
[27:14] scripture here
[27:16] family father we pray Lord tonight that
[27:18] you would be with us
[27:19] in a special way father just take care
[27:21] of us
[27:22] you know the thoughts on our heart Lord
[27:24] we've been thinking about for the past
[27:25] two or three days Lord and we pray that
[27:27] you would get it to the people Lord as
[27:30] it was given
[27:31] and it's your bless us Lord be an active
[27:33] participant in the service you be the
[27:35] speaker Lord you be the hearer Lord
[27:36] you'll be the ones that you be the one
[27:38] that takes over and not be one Lord of
[27:41] recording of our thoughts and ideas but
[27:43] Lord be the one that is preeminent in a
[27:45] service we actually just heal the sick
[27:47] and Afflicted Lord you said you sent a
[27:49] word and healed them
[27:50] delivering them from their destruction
[27:52] so Lord as the word Goes Forth we pray
[27:54] if there'll be a need tonight Lord that
[27:55] someone would just reach out and receive
[27:58] that healing father we ask your
[28:00] blessings on each one forgive us of our
[28:02] sins and many mistakes that we make
[28:03] against you every day Lord
[28:06] but we trust in you that we were chosen
[28:08] in you before the foundation of the
[28:10] world and we look to you father the
[28:12] author and finisher of our faith we ask
[28:14] you blessings on each one in Jesus name
[28:16] amen John 16 verse 7. so nevertheless I
[28:20] tell you the truth it is expedient for
[28:23] you that I go away for if I go not away
[28:25] the comforter will not come unto you but
[28:27] if I depart I will send him unto you and
[28:30] when he has come now that's a person
[28:32] that he
[28:34] right so it's a person he's sending a
[28:36] person back like brother Dale's always
[28:38] saying it the new birth is a person
[28:40] that's what he's showing you right here
[28:42] it's a person that's coming to you all
[28:44] right and when he has come he will
[28:46] reprove the world of sin and of
[28:48] righteousness and of Judgment of sin
[28:50] because they believe not on me of
[28:52] righteousness because I go to my father
[28:53] and you see me no more of judgment
[28:56] because the prince of this world is
[28:57] judged I have yet many things to say
[29:00] unto you but you cannot bear them now
[29:02] why
[29:05] they didn't have the Holy go right right
[29:07] they didn't have the discerner they
[29:09] didn't have the one they didn't have the
[29:10] guide they were just all running wild
[29:12] you know they they were they were even
[29:14] running wild until the upper room they
[29:16] left him at at Pilots Hall and they were
[29:19] not there at the crucifixion and they
[29:20] were just running like a bunch of scared
[29:23] people but on the day of Pentecost they
[29:26] come out the door with the guide in them
[29:28] knowing
[29:30] what they were doing at that time and
[29:32] that's a key we got to know
[29:34] I have yet many things to say unto you
[29:36] but you cannot bear them now how be it
[29:39] when he the spirit of Truth is come
[29:42] right
[29:43] right now what's President been talking
[29:46] about not a future event
[29:49] is come
[29:52] right he will guide you into some truth
[29:56] a quarter of Truth 99 truth
[30:01] all truth
[30:02] for he shall not speak of himself but
[30:05] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[30:07] speak and he will show you things to
[30:10] come amen you may be seated in the Lord
[30:12] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[30:13] word he'll show you things to come
[30:17] and I was talking to the brother uh just
[30:19] a few minutes ago from from Boston and
[30:22] he's got some of the sermons and he's
[30:24] going to send them to us in a couple of
[30:25] weeks so if you uh would care to see
[30:28] some of them that we'll have them there
[30:30] for you too
[30:32] to look online and uh
[30:34] you'll probably see a different me but
[30:36] you know if y'all would act like they
[30:38] did I might preach like I did then so
[30:40] but anyway we got a little bit excited
[30:43] but that's all right you get what you
[30:45] come for
[30:48] you're the one that works the gift I
[30:50] don't you work it you trigger every bit
[30:52] of it if you're going to sit there and
[30:53] sleep you can sit there and sleep and I
[30:54] may be a little sleepy myself
[30:56] but we weren't sleepy then that's for
[30:59] sure
[31:00] but they were enjoying
[31:02] the truth now we're talking about my
[31:04] guide and for those of you that hasn't
[31:07] went and looked online about what
[31:10] brother Jeff Jenkins has done
[31:12] but he has denounced the cloud he's he's
[31:16] just really a man confused
[31:19] and the reason I'm bringing this out is
[31:21] I'm bringing I'm making a point because
[31:23] if you watch the videos
[31:26] he keys on one thing
[31:29] message preachers
[31:33] Perugia he names them seven Thunders all
[31:37] those different doctrines he's a
[31:39] confused man
[31:41] but he's not
[31:43] wrong in some of the things he's saying
[31:46] because
[31:48] when he the spirit of Truth has come he
[31:51] will lead and guide you into all Truth
[31:53] All right so now we know that
[31:57] that the new birth is the birth of the
[31:59] word we know that
[32:01] but it doesn't necessarily have to be a
[32:03] birth of the message
[32:06] there's going to be let me say billions
[32:09] there's going to be billions of people
[32:10] that's born again
[32:12] over on the other side that's never
[32:14] heard of this message
[32:16] but they heard the message of Jesus
[32:17] Christ
[32:19] and that was his biggest point is is
[32:21] that and and I want you to see how
[32:24] important this is
[32:26] because he didn't have a guide to lead
[32:28] him through these things therefore it
[32:30] confused him so bad until he's turned
[32:33] the message away
[32:34] because he listened to different
[32:36] preachers
[32:37] because that's what he said he said do I
[32:39] want to see Perugia do I want to see
[32:41] seven Thunders do I want to believe Two
[32:42] Souls Amy he names them all
[32:45] uh which one
[32:48] but his main point was
[32:52] that we have put so much emphasis as a
[32:55] message Church
[32:57] preachers
[32:58] and listen to this in lieu of what
[33:00] happened you know several months ago or
[33:01] six or eight months ago where now that
[33:04] the that the message preachers are just
[33:06] saying well it's just believe in the
[33:08] message
[33:09] you get the new birth just Bible you
[33:11] always was eternal you was it see he
[33:13] brings that out and he said the message
[33:16] preachers have done that they have put a
[33:18] period
[33:20] where brother Brandon said put a comma
[33:22] right right they put a period and said
[33:25] if you don't believe the message
[33:28] you don't have the new birth
[33:31] okay now
[33:33] we know that the new birth is the birth
[33:35] of the word but a lot of people were
[33:37] born again without hearing the word we
[33:40] hear what we call the message
[33:43] but he is they have so confused this
[33:45] poor man
[33:47] until he's left the church his you know
[33:49] his just doing things that they
[33:51] shouldn't be doing his wife cutting her
[33:53] hair and wearing pants already right off
[33:54] the bat but see that spirit will take a
[33:57] hold and I was telling them in the back
[33:58] there's two things going to happen to
[34:00] that man and I'm telling you the same
[34:02] thing
[34:04] he's either got the Holy Ghost and got a
[34:06] devil on him and he won't live very long
[34:09] you remember brother Ramsey
[34:11] right brother Branham with brother
[34:12] Ramsey brother Ramsey was a born-again
[34:14] Believer preacher he said I ain't
[34:16] preaching no more get me some beer God
[34:18] took him off the scene either that or
[34:21] the brothers not born again one of the
[34:22] two you can't stay that's why I want to
[34:24] speak tonight oh my God because you
[34:26] can't stay in one place right you got to
[34:29] move somewhere somewhere one way or the
[34:31] other you if you stand still your back
[34:33] slid right amen
[34:35] if you stand still your back sled
[34:39] right so we look and we see
[34:42] that's what kind of brought me to this
[34:46] because remember
[34:48] Paul and Peter
[34:50] here's the confusion in the message
[34:53] you got people believing return Ministry
[34:55] tint this tent that this and that you
[34:58] got everything in the book
[35:00] there's only one truth people amen
[35:03] amen one
[35:05] Paul brother Brown said in a guy I
[35:08] didn't put it on here he said Paul went
[35:10] three years into the desert came out of
[35:13] the desert was in a church for 14 years
[35:15] met Peter and he said they were eye to
[35:18] eye the same Doctrine amen
[35:23] that's right now show that to me in the
[35:25] message
[35:26] it's like brother now said what's your
[35:28] input what's your angle there ain't no
[35:31] angle right
[35:32] right it's either truth or lie
[35:35] one of the two
[35:37] but we haven't been left alone
[35:40] defend for ourself we haven't been left
[35:43] in a Wilderness you just wonder what
[35:45] we're doing right
[35:47] right there's a Holy Ghost
[35:49] then I believe that me and the pastor
[35:52] down in Miami he was asking me some
[35:54] questions
[35:55] and I shocked him a little bit because
[35:57] you know how I am I'll shock you a
[35:59] little bit if you'll listen
[36:01] he said why well praise the Lord anyhow
[36:04] but he said why do these brothers come
[36:07] to my church and pull the people away
[36:09] and why do they listen and why do they
[36:11] do that seven churches have split from
[36:13] that one brother's Church
[36:16] now I was thinking in my mind
[36:19] somebody don't have the Holy Ghost
[36:23] but I said
[36:25] I said well brother I just don't believe
[36:27] they're born again if they do you that
[36:29] way and if they do that with the intent
[36:31] of stealing your people or preaching
[36:34] another Doctrine then they're just not
[36:36] born again because remember
[36:38] if Peter and Paul saw eye to eye and
[36:42] Doctrine what's our problem right
[36:45] right what's our problem in the message
[36:48] today
[36:51] same Holy Ghost
[36:53] gets the same results
[36:57] if not Peter would have had one idea
[36:59] Peter would have had he's coming on you
[37:01] know this day and Paul's got this but
[37:03] remember when Paul was preaching Paul
[37:06] was preaching the resurrection so clear
[37:09] that it was a resurrection here first
[37:14] that Phillips and hymenius took it that
[37:16] they were the resurrection had already
[37:18] passed and they got it from Paul's quote
[37:21] book right
[37:22] they got it from Paul's sermons
[37:25] but you can't have that when the when
[37:28] when that which is in
[37:30] part is in view yeah you can have that
[37:33] Martin Luther could preach a father-son
[37:35] holy ghost baptism he could he could
[37:37] preach these so he could say the Jews
[37:39] should be took out and killed that was
[37:41] his idea right
[37:45] all right wasn't the Holy Ghost idea
[37:48] it was his idea but God winked at that
[37:51] but when that which is perfect has come
[37:54] that's our hour
[37:56] the perfect
[37:57] interpretation of the word with Divine
[38:00] Vindication is now here I don't care
[38:03] what the preacher says I don't care what
[38:05] the world says
[38:07] right we had a Minister's meeting not
[38:10] too long ago about you know should we
[38:12] put our messages online
[38:14] should we password code them I said
[38:17] password codem
[38:20] password code them they were talking
[38:23] about what happened with brother Donnie
[38:25] I said it came from inside his church
[38:29] right how you gonna password because you
[38:31] know a lot of people just have give the
[38:33] password out to the congregation in case
[38:34] they miss a service they can watch it
[38:36] online and it doesn't go to anybody else
[38:39] they said well that would protect it
[38:41] that ain't unprotected it didn't protect
[38:43] him it came from a woman inside his
[38:45] church
[38:47] so how you gonna password protect no put
[38:50] the message out
[38:55] if Obama's listening
[38:58] maybe he'll get converted
[39:04] I don't want to bring light to this
[39:06] thing but I'm telling you when I came
[39:07] back from Miami I said this is it come
[39:09] on I'm done with this pitter-pattering
[39:12] around with well it's okay to believe
[39:14] the way you believe no it's not okay if
[39:15] you're not right
[39:18] and how can the Holy Ghost be wrong
[39:23] how
[39:25] look at the confusion I want you to
[39:28] watch those videos and if you get
[39:30] confused you need a new birth
[39:33] thank you Josh
[39:37] be what ill
[39:44] he watched this one he watched that one
[39:46] he wanted to do this he wanted to get
[39:48] this one he wanted to get that one
[39:50] and he had no established God he had no
[39:54] person
[39:56] he had no person no pastor
[40:00] his dad was a pastor for a long time and
[40:02] he passed away a couple years ago and I
[40:04] feel for the brother I really do
[40:06] I
[40:07] I can see the pain in it in his eyes I
[40:10] mean it's like you said he's give up
[40:11] everything he had a big church two or
[40:13] three hundred people now he's out of a
[40:15] job
[40:17] so he's give up a lot
[40:19] but
[40:20] I tell you
[40:22] he talks about the spirit of Truth
[40:26] when he's looking right at the Spirit of
[40:28] Truth
[40:30] now tell me one thing where did that
[40:32] come from yeah
[40:34] Jesus was standing there in front of the
[40:36] Pharisees
[40:41] and they said the same thing right
[40:44] right you're illegitimate
[40:47] you're a wine bibber you hang around
[40:49] with prostitutes and thieves
[40:53] same thing if you want to pick on the
[40:56] humanity of the man you gonna find wrong
[40:57] in all of us
[41:02] but if you can't if you don't have the
[41:05] spirit of Truth
[41:07] you've got to have an anchor
[41:10] that's right I sang all day today The
[41:11] Anchor Holds
[41:13] though the ship be battered
[41:16] beat up
[41:18] the anchor hole
[41:21] it's going to hold somebody
[41:24] dumb enough to believe it's me they like
[41:25] that in Miami that's dumb enough to
[41:27] believe it's me and they started saying
[41:28] it
[41:30] dumb enough to believe it's me
[41:34] but
[41:37] let's look at the first quote
[41:42] because
[41:45] we must have a standard
[41:48] now remember
[41:51] brother Branham as a person
[41:54] is not our absolute
[41:59] listen he was the first prophet
[42:02] that had children that lived a
[42:05] semi-normal father
[42:08] Grandpa he was the first prophet all the
[42:11] other prophets were either not married
[42:12] or or married one or you understand what
[42:15] I'm saying he was the first prophet that
[42:17] really was even even the Lord Jesus
[42:20] didn't have a wife
[42:21] but brother Brown had all that yet he
[42:24] kept it together
[42:27] and it was an example for me and you but
[42:30] our absolute is the Bible
[42:32] our absolute is Jesus Christ
[42:35] there's no way you can understand it
[42:37] though without being born again
[42:40] I don't care listen there is no message
[42:43] seniority
[42:45] there is no message seniority
[42:48] I don't care if you've been in the
[42:49] message 30 minutes
[42:51] if you got the Holy Ghost and somebody
[42:52] been in the message 30 years and ain't
[42:54] got the Holy Ghost you're way ahead of
[42:55] him
[42:57] or her
[42:59] don't let me get excited here we go
[43:02] a guide oh that's what people say today
[43:04] oh now wait you don't believe now if I
[43:06] go to church and pay my tithes and I do
[43:08] this the other God is going to cast me
[43:10] down there they're asking that question
[43:13] brother Brian was very specific unless a
[43:15] man is born again he'll not even
[43:17] understand the kingdom of God see no
[43:20] excuses
[43:23] now see that's what brother Brandon was
[43:25] come to do he came to bring Clarity he
[43:27] didn't come to change the Bible
[43:31] we didn't understand it it's been clear
[43:33] from eternity I believe the thing was
[43:35] written before the foundation of the
[43:36] world
[43:37] so who are we to change it
[43:41] right and of course the brother I mean
[43:43] he takes you think one word off see he
[43:46] takes what I just said and he said well
[43:48] who is Brother Branham to insert himself
[43:50] in first Thessalonians
[43:52] or there where it says the Lord himself
[43:53] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[43:55] who is he to insert himself well brother
[43:57] Brown didn't insert himself
[44:00] it's the message
[44:03] it's a message that was the shout not
[44:05] William Branham I thought we were the
[44:07] shout right
[44:08] I thought we were the boys
[44:13] let me tell you some people this thing
[44:15] it's like brother Brown said he said so
[44:17] many people are so narrow-minded you
[44:18] can't even put a pencil between their
[44:19] eyes
[44:22] that's a quote
[44:25] he said you can't put a lead pencil
[44:26] between their eyes without touching both
[44:28] eyeballs
[44:30] they said narrow-minded unless a man's
[44:32] born again now remember brother Branham
[44:34] did not come to change how we get the
[44:37] new birth
[44:39] like I said there's going to be billions
[44:41] of people in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[44:43] that don't know one thing about seals
[44:45] vials plagues Two Souls seventh on
[44:48] diversary whatever you want to call it
[44:50] amen amen never heard of William Branham
[44:56] never heard of him
[44:59] now don't get me wrong this is the
[45:01] spirit of Truth come
[45:03] on and this is the Perfection of that
[45:05] Spirit of Truth
[45:09] but you don't have
[45:11] to see the message to get born again
[45:15] but if you get born again you'll have to
[45:18] see the message
[45:19] hey man
[45:21] that's why I'll get them Born Again
[45:23] first right
[45:26] right there's nothing in the Bible
[45:29] it talks about the message before the
[45:32] new birth
[45:34] it's the new birth no excuses well the
[45:36] poor old man the Pearl woman that's a
[45:38] good old soul
[45:40] the only way they can ever see God is be
[45:43] born again
[45:44] that's all I don't care how little how
[45:47] old how young what they did how much
[45:49] they went to church how many
[45:50] denominations they knew how much Creed
[45:52] they could recite you've got to be born
[45:54] again or you're not you're not even on
[45:57] the foundation
[45:59] to begin amen now I believe he's talking
[46:01] about right here because he preached
[46:02] statue of a perfect man and he refers to
[46:04] the chart on the message my or a guy in
[46:08] my life you're not even on the
[46:09] foundation yet right
[46:11] so you got to be born again how in the
[46:13] world are you going to understand
[46:14] something Supernatural
[46:17] with just a natural brain right you're
[46:20] just going to have intellect right
[46:23] right I've told you many times before
[46:26] I wasn't born again
[46:27] but I can understand serpent seed when I
[46:30] was 10 12 years old
[46:31] I knew one God I knew those things were
[46:34] right I saw water baptism and I wasn't
[46:36] even born again right
[46:38] right I could see it in the Bible
[46:41] but it wasn't quickened
[46:44] it wasn't something that would hold me
[46:46] come on
[46:47] come on because I didn't have the one in
[46:48] me to hold me
[46:52] so you see you need the guide
[46:56] rolled up
[46:58] paragraph 98. there you go so you see
[47:02] you need the guide he will guide you to
[47:05] truth and truth is the word he will
[47:08] guide you and it always has been
[47:11] God don't never have to change nothing
[47:14] right right because he's infinite he
[47:16] knows what's best he's omnipresent he's
[47:18] omniscient he's everything it's right
[47:20] God is so he don't have to change
[47:23] so there we can put our confidence amen
[47:26] he is a confirmer of the way he's
[47:28] leading you the Holy Ghost of God is the
[47:31] confirmer of the same word that he's
[47:33] teaching right
[47:35] right now how are you going to get it
[47:40] you gotta hear it right
[47:43] exactly
[47:45] now Luke was led by the god to say go
[47:48] you into all the world preach the gospel
[47:49] to Every Creature he that believeth and
[47:50] is baptized shall be saved he that
[47:52] believeth not shall be named these signs
[47:54] shall follow them that believe in my
[47:55] name they shall cast out devil speak
[47:56] when you tongues take up serpentry and
[47:58] dig with things lay hands on the
[47:59] sickness shall recover the Bible says
[48:01] that they went forth everywhere led by
[48:03] the God you know preach the word the
[48:05] signs followed what was it the guide
[48:07] vindicating that was the truth
[48:11] because you've got to have a Vindication
[48:12] right
[48:15] right we're just humans you got to have
[48:16] a vindication
[48:18] how many of you
[48:21] think you're born again don't think
[48:23] you're born again you know
[48:25] we go through these human emotions
[48:29] but there's got to be a typo somewhere
[48:31] because I'm telling you this not going
[48:33] to get easier right right it's going to
[48:35] get more pressure and more pressure you
[48:37] see people falling away go on believe
[48:39] the sign I wish they'd take that stupid
[48:41] thing off the internet
[48:43] they got a list of people that's
[48:45] defected from the message people that
[48:48] they have saved
[48:50] and the list just keeps growing
[48:53] because the people's not been taught
[48:55] right
[48:55] right the people have not been taught
[48:58] the people have been listening to ever
[49:00] this and ever that is the preacher's
[49:02] fault
[49:04] it's not you the laity it's what you're
[49:06] hearing because you take on the spirit
[49:08] of who you're listening to
[49:10] that's kind of scary isn't it
[49:21] but remember
[49:23] when Peter and Paul
[49:25] now remember
[49:27] Paul had a problem with Peter
[49:29] in a normal thing that was going on
[49:32] everybody understand that
[49:36] because remember Peter is the one
[49:40] that give us that formula Peter is
[49:45] Peter gave us that formula Peter wasn't
[49:48] a baby in Christ when Paul
[49:51] took him apart
[49:54] but you know what Peterson Peterson say
[49:56] well bless God who's he think he is I've
[49:59] been in the message longer than he has
[50:00] eyes with the prophet
[50:04] he was with Jesus Paul wanted
[50:07] he had seniority
[50:10] Peter could have said hey I got the keys
[50:12] no he didn't Peter said I'm sure Peter
[50:14] said thank you
[50:16] Peter said Thank you thank you very much
[50:18] I was out of line I'm sorry
[50:22] you ever heard that word repent right
[50:27] right it's one we don't use anymore
[50:28] they're going to take it out of the
[50:29] dictionary
[50:31] because we don't use it anymore I hope
[50:33] everything's okay here
[50:35] because remember
[50:37] there's something we got to be fortified
[50:39] behind right and there's signs and
[50:42] there's things that we got to look at
[50:43] and we got to see because we're going to
[50:46] be
[50:47] pulled into every direction right
[50:52] right exactly and do you know what it's
[50:54] like I was telling brother Joe in the
[50:55] back we're going to talk about what a
[50:56] God is in a few minutes
[50:59] but do you know
[51:01] that even the Holy Ghost be in your
[51:03] guide
[51:04] you can pull him off and go in another
[51:06] Direction
[51:08] you want scripture for that
[51:11] grieve not right the Holy Spirit
[51:15] brother Brown said so you must be able
[51:16] to grieve it he's tempt he's timid he's
[51:18] a gentleman now you take a guy that goes
[51:20] out in Colorado with you and you say
[51:22] look buddy I'm going in that direction
[51:23] and that guy said no we're going in this
[51:25] direction because this is the deer and I
[51:26] know where everything is you say no I'm
[51:28] going to go in this direction he's
[51:29] either going to shoot you right there
[51:32] and get you out of his his misery
[51:36] or he's going to say well you go on I'm
[51:38] not going with you
[51:40] but by our free moral agency though God
[51:43] can be standing there saying this is
[51:45] where we need to go and you can say I'm
[51:47] going in that direction
[51:49] sure you can
[51:52] now I believe once you get closer to the
[51:56] Statue of a perfect man to where that
[51:58] Holy Ghost comes and seals you in that
[52:01] gets more and more where the preeminence
[52:03] of the Holy Ghost takes over
[52:06] exactly right
[52:08] because the headstone is I do the will
[52:11] of my father not my own will
[52:13] amen that's what we've been lacking down
[52:16] Through the Ages we've done our own well
[52:20] Martin Luther he did his own will
[52:22] because the will of God wasn't a father
[52:23] son Holy Ghost baptism amen
[52:28] we still believe in spirits right right
[52:30] you can get a spirit on you
[52:33] but now one thing's for sure it's like I
[52:35] said about about this brother
[52:37] either he's born again and God's going
[52:39] to shut him up and take him off the
[52:40] scene or he's not born again God's not
[52:42] going to let him continue on in that
[52:43] direction
[52:45] he's not
[52:47] same thing with me and you the little
[52:48] miss the full things that we do is
[52:50] driving us to the Grave right
[52:55] I said the little things we do we ought
[52:57] to be forgetting the big things
[53:01] I'll tell you one thing's for sure
[53:04] brother Dale says on Sunday he says
[53:06] those of you that's not going to come
[53:07] back this afternoon
[53:12] you backslid as a donkey
[53:14] if you don't come to church on that
[53:16] afternoon
[53:18] come on people good grief
[53:20] brother Brown said you can't wait for
[53:23] them doors open he didn't say just one
[53:24] time on Sunday
[53:28] oh so we don't want to quote brother
[53:30] Brandon when that comes up
[53:32] but the Bible says the more that we see
[53:35] the day approaching right
[53:37] we should come more
[53:40] now if you're not coming to church more
[53:42] than you were you're backslid or lost
[53:45] one of the two right
[53:48] I'm gonna tell you to your face you
[53:50] backslid or lost one of the two
[53:52] you can't be born again and stay home
[53:55] how can you do that right
[53:58] my God must be different from yours
[54:03] Pearl brother dick comes up here with
[54:05] limping and all kind of stuff but
[54:07] here and faithful
[54:10] you know why because I believe some of
[54:13] us see a goal right they see a spot that
[54:16] they're striving for
[54:18] right they see a place that and that's
[54:21] what this is
[54:22] this is placing
[54:24] if this brother's born again he hasn't
[54:28] been placed
[54:31] he hasn't been taught enough to be
[54:33] placed to know where he is or he
[54:35] wouldn't say the things that he said
[54:36] same thing with all of us right
[54:39] oh we let all this junk get in our way
[54:44] did you read what brother Brown said he
[54:46] said no excuses right
[54:51] right so that's why we don't listen to
[54:52] excuses
[54:53] right
[54:54] because brother Brown said no excuses
[54:57] there's no excuses if you have the same
[54:58] guide now Peter Peter didn't act one way
[55:01] and Paul acts another
[55:05] sure now Peter had a problem with one
[55:07] thing but I believe he corrected it you
[55:08] know what that didn't ever happen again
[55:11] because he saw he was wrong in his
[55:13] Humanity he wanted to bring something or
[55:16] something into that Temple and or a
[55:18] little different way that Peter wanted
[55:20] to do and Paul said you can't do that
[55:22] right
[55:23] and Paul said and Peter said I'm sorry
[55:25] I'm sure he repented said God forgive me
[55:28] for that
[55:28] and you know what they went on and you
[55:30] know what I don't believe that they
[55:31] disfellowship because of that
[55:35] it's like brother Joe's talking in the
[55:37] back talking to a preacher that that
[55:39] this other preacher is wanting to get
[55:41] his Doctrine across to him get his
[55:42] Doctrine across to him get his doctor
[55:43] across to him and the brother finally
[55:45] says I I just can't see it brother and
[55:47] was going to shake his hand said the
[55:48] brother smacked his hand out of the way
[55:52] people
[55:55] I told him in Miami
[55:59] and they had to gulp a little bit before
[56:01] they said amen
[56:03] I said either
[56:05] if you got two opinions either one's
[56:08] right
[56:09] and one's wrong
[56:11] or they're both wrong because they both
[56:13] can't be right
[56:16] when it comes to the word of God they
[56:18] both can't be right
[56:21] so there is a razor edge there is and
[56:24] it's like I was telling them you know
[56:26] Paul stands up and he says you're going
[56:27] to be judged by what I say
[56:30] now some people may say that's arrogant
[56:33] I say it's confident Paul knew he had a
[56:36] message to bring
[56:37] you and I brother Dale myself Aaron
[56:39] Brother Bob all the ones that that do
[56:42] anything in this church you've got to
[56:43] know where you're at right
[56:45] right and you got to know that if your
[56:47] purpose is for this
[56:49] then you need to get into this and
[56:50] forget all the other stuff
[56:54] I can't be an evangelist
[56:57] I just can't I ain't built for that
[56:59] Joel Forney is built to be an evangelist
[57:04] by the way he said hey Hayden talk to
[57:06] him today
[57:08] but listen when you have a guide
[57:13] and that guy if you want to go hunting
[57:14] we've been on several unguided trips
[57:18] and they've been a not a disaster but we
[57:22] really haven't got anything yeah
[57:24] we've been on some guided trips that we
[57:25] really haven't got anything but we've
[57:27] been on some guided trips that the guy
[57:29] knew where to go he knew what to do and
[57:32] that's this way with the Holy Ghost
[57:33] you've got to know number one that you
[57:36] got it
[57:40] amen when he the spirit of Truth has
[57:42] come right
[57:43] right he will lead you and guide you
[57:44] into all truth
[57:46] so we come down to where and even
[57:49] brother Brown said it's the most
[57:50] ill-taught subject
[57:52] is how to receive Christ
[57:55] because like I said before
[57:57] it's not how much you know about the
[57:59] sales
[58:00] hold on a minute
[58:02] vows plagues
[58:05] because I'm going to read you here that
[58:06] we need to go on to Perfection right
[58:09] right but when we get started getting
[58:11] started
[58:12] that God is going to help you
[58:16] in the continuance but you got to have
[58:19] the guide there
[58:21] it's kind of like Dad says about the the
[58:23] ticket for the airplane and the bus well
[58:26] I'm going to say the same thing if me
[58:27] and brother Donnie are going hunting in
[58:29] Texas and we've already called the God
[58:30] and he's there waiting on us and he's
[58:32] already got everything ready and got all
[58:34] the provisions ready and we take a
[58:36] flight to Philadelphia Pennsylvania
[58:40] that guy's not going to do us any good
[58:42] right
[58:43] amen but when we go there and the
[58:47] provisions been made
[58:49] Hey listen I know it's a struggle to
[58:51] live in life I know it's a struggle to
[58:52] get to church but you know what you got
[58:54] to overcome something
[58:57] you got to overcome something you got to
[58:59] be an overcomer
[59:04] come on people
[59:08] like I told them down there
[59:11] and God forgive me if this is wrong but
[59:13] we have wasted our time on do's and
[59:15] don'ts
[59:16] we have wasted our time
[59:19] there was a time for it there was a time
[59:22] but let me tell you something if you've
[59:23] got the God in your life
[59:26] you don't have to run around and watch a
[59:28] holy ghost fail sister
[59:31] how many of you would let me go look in
[59:33] your
[59:35] Pantry or we call them vanity
[59:41] some hands are up some are not do you
[59:44] not know yours
[59:46] it's got all this other stuff in it
[59:49] but would you
[59:51] would you open up
[59:53] well you know what
[59:56] he's already there right I don't have to
[59:58] go
[59:59] but you can't get a holy ghost-filled
[1:00:01] woman to put on a pair of pants you
[1:00:02] can't get a Holy Ghost Field woman to
[1:00:04] cut her hair wear makeup
[1:00:07] it's just this is just the simple part
[1:00:09] of it right
[1:00:11] you can't get a holy ghost filled person
[1:00:13] said at home when church is going on
[1:00:14] either
[1:00:19] and it ain't how much you come to church
[1:00:21] right
[1:00:22] but if you're born again you will right
[1:00:28] that ain't popular but I don't care it's
[1:00:30] the Bible
[1:00:32] we just don't believe it's nearer to the
[1:00:34] end now we think we're all so revelated
[1:00:35] and we're also way up here in the in the
[1:00:38] Capstone and we disappear on Sunday
[1:00:46] told you before I've seen people that
[1:00:48] thought they were this and thought they
[1:00:49] were that and if I got to act like that
[1:00:50] I don't want it
[1:00:55] where was I
[1:00:56] hunting
[1:00:58] now listen that guide
[1:01:00] will show you around
[1:01:02] a real true guide he's already been
[1:01:04] where you're going to hunt
[1:01:06] he's already been he's already been
[1:01:08] there he knows about every tree
[1:01:10] he knows all the Tendencies because he's
[1:01:12] been there yeah this is just a natural
[1:01:15] story
[1:01:19] he knows the country
[1:01:21] and you know what if it comes up a storm
[1:01:22] he knows what to do
[1:01:24] because he's been through one before
[1:01:27] he's not out there like you would be and
[1:01:29] I would be running around in the wild
[1:01:31] not knowing where we're at right
[1:01:33] that's why we need a guide
[1:01:35] we got to have somebody to guide us
[1:01:38] because we are sheep right
[1:01:41] and sheep have to be led
[1:01:44] now look
[1:01:46] you want an example let's turn to Acts
[1:01:49] 8.
[1:01:52] now I'm sorry for what I said about the
[1:01:54] do's and don'ts but we have we have
[1:01:55] spent our time
[1:01:58] preaching on women right
[1:02:04] yeah and I know brother Brown said you
[1:02:05] got to live white and spit or live right
[1:02:07] and spit white and all that and I
[1:02:09] believe that amen
[1:02:11] but that's in your journey of becoming a
[1:02:13] Christian right I've said many times
[1:02:16] before it I only have to speak from my
[1:02:18] journey and I know you will too we were
[1:02:20] all legalists when we first started
[1:02:22] going through justification Saints why
[1:02:24] because it was do's and don'ts because
[1:02:25] it was me doing it and not doing it not
[1:02:27] somebody telling me
[1:02:29] exactly when I got born again I didn't
[1:02:31] have to have brother Dale preach to me
[1:02:33] to quit dipping chewing tobacco right
[1:02:37] actually that should have went
[1:02:39] sanctification
[1:02:42] we got all these steps messed up and
[1:02:45] that's why that brother's messed up I
[1:02:47] don't believe he understands
[1:02:48] justification sanctification in the
[1:02:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:53] what about that message preacher been in
[1:02:56] the message 30 years
[1:02:58] 30 years
[1:03:00] seniority don't mean squat
[1:03:04] nothing
[1:03:06] God comes in and gets born again six
[1:03:08] months later
[1:03:10] if he's got a revelation I'd soon listen
[1:03:12] to him as Listen to Somebody That ain't
[1:03:14] got the Holy Ghost living for 30 years
[1:03:15] and things are in the message and puts
[1:03:17] their own ideas in it
[1:03:19] listen to this acts 8 29 then the spirit
[1:03:22] said unto Philip
[1:03:24] well here we got a guide
[1:03:27] the spirit said to Philip
[1:03:30] go near and join thyself to this chariot
[1:03:35] because everybody know the story this is
[1:03:37] the Ethiopian unit he's sitting on his
[1:03:38] Chariot he's reading the Old Testament
[1:03:41] and he's having a problem
[1:03:44] now see this was my question that they
[1:03:46] couldn't answer when I talked to the
[1:03:47] brothers and said well you you had
[1:03:49] eternal life when you was born
[1:03:51] and it was just quick and
[1:03:54] when you heard the message well now why
[1:03:56] didn't
[1:03:57] why didn't the Ethiopian eunuch if he
[1:03:59] was
[1:04:00] born again or had eternal life in his
[1:04:03] soul why didn't he just read the
[1:04:04] scripture and get it right
[1:04:06] exactly and Philip ran thither to him
[1:04:09] and heard him read the prophet Isaiah
[1:04:12] and said understandeth thou what thou
[1:04:14] readeth
[1:04:16] in the Ethiopian unit said how can I
[1:04:19] pretty smart fella how can I accept some
[1:04:23] man should guide me
[1:04:25] look at the humble attitude The Humble
[1:04:28] Spirit right that the Ethiopian unit in
[1:04:30] other words he didn't say hey bless God
[1:04:32] I've been in a message about as long as
[1:04:34] you have get off my chariot
[1:04:36] foreign
[1:04:40] people I'm sorry you know brother Brown
[1:04:43] said one time he said God forgive me for
[1:04:44] being critical remember he had a
[1:04:46] critical spirit brother Brown had a
[1:04:48] critical spirit and had to get God to
[1:04:49] get that thing off well if I got one God
[1:04:51] take it away from me but I've seen how
[1:04:54] this is ruining look at that church of
[1:04:56] 300 people that was following that man
[1:04:59] and now they're just scattered
[1:05:01] everywhere
[1:05:04] and a man sitting there blurting all
[1:05:06] this out over the internet and letting
[1:05:08] people hear it
[1:05:10] somebody's got to stand up and accuse it
[1:05:12] right
[1:05:14] and he said how can I accept some man
[1:05:16] should guide me and he desired Philip
[1:05:21] boy he wanted to talk to Philip more
[1:05:23] than he wanted anything else
[1:05:26] that he would come up and sit with him
[1:05:30] that's kind of like communion
[1:05:33] the place of the scripture which he read
[1:05:35] was this he was led as a sheep to the
[1:05:37] slaughter like a lambdom before his
[1:05:38] share so open not his mouth
[1:05:41] in his humiliation his judgment was
[1:05:44] taken away and who shall declare his
[1:05:46] generation now he's reading Isaiah 53
[1:05:47] for his life is taken from the earth and
[1:05:50] the eunuch answered Philip and said I
[1:05:52] pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet
[1:05:54] this of himself or some other man
[1:05:57] then Philip opened his mouth and said
[1:06:00] have you not read
[1:06:05] the quote
[1:06:12] you know what we do
[1:06:16] Philip right I wasn't going to say that
[1:06:19] but thanks for saying it brother dick
[1:06:20] said that God sent a prophet
[1:06:22] and he did send a prophet right
[1:06:25] but the prophets got to guide you to
[1:06:27] that prophet
[1:06:30] then Philip opened his mouth and began
[1:06:32] at the same scripture
[1:06:34] he didn't pull out his own quotes
[1:06:37] hello he didn't pull his own quote book
[1:06:40] out
[1:06:41] he began at the same scripture and
[1:06:44] preached unto him Jesus
[1:06:48] it'll always be that right
[1:06:50] it will always be that
[1:06:54] right we need to preach Jesus to these
[1:06:56] people that come into the message
[1:06:58] amen because I'll guarantee you if you
[1:07:00] see Jesus you're going to see the
[1:07:02] Amplified version
[1:07:05] amen because he's the word and the Word
[1:07:08] was brought to us by a prophet right now
[1:07:10] what we've done is we've tore it into
[1:07:12] all different pieces
[1:07:16] I say not us but them
[1:07:19] because I'm going to get to something in
[1:07:20] a minute
[1:07:22] you like me or hate me
[1:07:24] daddy said if everybody likes you you're
[1:07:25] a hypocrite so good maybe somebody hates
[1:07:27] me
[1:07:29] you know that's the truth
[1:07:31] if everybody likes you that means you
[1:07:34] cater to everybody right and you're a
[1:07:36] hypocrite
[1:07:37] right that's okay that people don't like
[1:07:39] me but if I tell you the truth
[1:07:42] you have to listen to the truth anyway
[1:07:43] right amen
[1:07:46] so we look at this God
[1:07:50] and we see that Philip
[1:07:53] preached Jesus
[1:07:56] and then as the story develops we see
[1:07:58] the Ethiopian eunuch
[1:08:00] he repents he's baptized
[1:08:03] and he goes over into Ethiopia and the
[1:08:06] prophet of God says that he
[1:08:09] preached the gospel there why because he
[1:08:11] got to guide someone with the guide
[1:08:14] brought to God
[1:08:16] and he took that guide and he didn't go
[1:08:18] over there and start preaching Ethiopian
[1:08:21] eunuch Doctrine right
[1:08:24] he preached the savior he preached Jesus
[1:08:27] Christ he preached the Redeemer
[1:08:31] and folks that's what brother Branham
[1:08:32] brought us amen amen he brought us
[1:08:35] the way now I want you to read something
[1:08:38] now we're going to read Hebrews 6 1.
[1:08:43] because
[1:08:44] and I want to read you a quote
[1:08:47] and read your several scriptures and
[1:08:49] then make a few comments and they'll be
[1:08:51] finished I've only got two quotes
[1:08:52] tonight
[1:08:53] Hebrews 6 1 therefore leaving the
[1:08:55] principles now that word principles if
[1:08:57] you look it up in the in the Greek that
[1:08:59] word principles means Beginnings right
[1:09:03] all right
[1:09:04] and leaving is not where you're going to
[1:09:07] leave it and then not believe it anymore
[1:09:10] right
[1:09:11] right it's you have that as a foundation
[1:09:15] you have that as a foundation
[1:09:18] and then you're going to grow up
[1:09:22] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:09:24] doctrine of Christ Christ
[1:09:26] let us go on into Perfection right
[1:09:29] right not laying again the foundation of
[1:09:31] repentance from dead Works in a faith
[1:09:33] toward god of the doctrine see all his
[1:09:35] Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine doctrine of
[1:09:37] baptism we got to know these things we
[1:09:39] got to know these doctrines of baptism
[1:09:40] but listen folks if you repent and
[1:09:42] you're baptized you get the Holy Ghost
[1:09:45] you got to see something
[1:09:48] and it's not different from what I see
[1:09:52] now you may be you may be
[1:09:57] a little lacking in a revelation
[1:10:00] because we all are right
[1:10:03] I knew what happened in the garden
[1:10:06] okay
[1:10:08] but when I got born again 15 years ago
[1:10:11] all that was quickened or made alive and
[1:10:15] it put the whole Bible together not just
[1:10:17] that one section amen now that's what
[1:10:20] the God will do he'll take you and guide
[1:10:22] you right through that book
[1:10:24] and then when you read a quote they
[1:10:27] marry each other
[1:10:29] there's a union
[1:10:31] between what is in the scriptures and
[1:10:34] what the prophet of God said not at this
[1:10:36] Union
[1:10:37] that's what most people have made it to
[1:10:39] this Union it's got to be this it's got
[1:10:41] to be that yeah
[1:10:42] but there is a spirit of Truth
[1:10:48] amen of the doctrine of baptism and
[1:10:49] laying on of hands and the resurrection
[1:10:51] of the dead and of Eternal judgment that
[1:10:53] pretty much covers everything yeah
[1:10:55] that's Resurrection
[1:10:57] baptism
[1:10:59] healing resurrection and judgment
[1:11:02] covered it all right there and this will
[1:11:05] we do if God permits right
[1:11:08] now
[1:11:09] here was here is our problem not ours
[1:11:13] but most people in the message say well
[1:11:15] you got to believe the message and that
[1:11:17] means you're born again they've got it
[1:11:19] backwards
[1:11:22] when you get born again you will
[1:11:27] see the message
[1:11:28] because you can't be guided into a
[1:11:31] father-son holy ghost baptism because
[1:11:32] the because the spirit of Truth is here
[1:11:35] the Perfection of God not that they were
[1:11:38] in an imperfection of God they were
[1:11:41] imperfected in their thoughts right
[1:11:44] right do you ever understand that they
[1:11:46] were imperfected in their thoughts
[1:11:47] Martin Luther was imperfected and it
[1:11:49] stopped because all he could see was
[1:11:51] Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism but
[1:11:53] God said okay I'll wink at that but that
[1:11:55] just shall live by faith that's what
[1:11:56] you're going to live by
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:02] do you know what
[1:12:05] it's going to be a lot of people in
[1:12:06] heaven though
[1:12:07] that was baptized in the name of father
[1:12:09] son Holy Ghost
[1:12:10] bride
[1:12:14] hello
[1:12:17] it's not going to have Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:18] baptism but God winked at that ignorance
[1:12:22] of the day of the preaching
[1:12:25] that's where they got it from
[1:12:27] ignorance of the preaching God's going
[1:12:29] to wink at that and he give him the Holy
[1:12:31] Ghost anyhow because they believed on
[1:12:33] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:39] the problem with people
[1:12:42] is they do put a period they do cabbage
[1:12:45] down
[1:12:45] they do say this is it
[1:12:48] well this message is it
[1:12:53] but I'm not like him see that brother
[1:12:56] put a comma and said there's something
[1:12:58] past what brother Brown and brought
[1:13:00] no
[1:13:02] he brought us the truth and you can put
[1:13:04] a period behind that
[1:13:07] but in all that there's commas
[1:13:10] that God's going to lead you through
[1:13:13] from your human understanding to a
[1:13:16] supernatural Revelation because you've
[1:13:18] got to have it in your natural human
[1:13:20] ability first
[1:13:25] hallelujah amen amen that the Lord Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ died for your sins that's why an
[1:13:32] illiterate person can receive the new
[1:13:34] birth he don't have to read 14 message
[1:13:36] books to get the new birth
[1:13:40] the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:13:42] Christ
[1:13:43] and thou shalt be saved
[1:13:45] that's our problem
[1:13:48] not too many you bursts the prophet said
[1:13:52] maybe a
[1:13:55] birth in a way he said false teachers
[1:13:58] bring false birth
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:03] but that God
[1:14:05] one more time before we read this
[1:14:08] that guide has understanding of what the
[1:14:12] whole Hunt is going to be about
[1:14:13] now he doesn't know you
[1:14:17] so you and him are going to have to bond
[1:14:19] some way right
[1:14:20] but now that's not the way with the Holy
[1:14:22] Ghost God knows your character right
[1:14:25] and even me and my character the way I
[1:14:27] am that some of you may not like and I
[1:14:29] really don't care
[1:14:32] God's if he give me the new birth he
[1:14:34] likes some part of me right
[1:14:37] and he said I'm pleased to dwell
[1:14:39] and I'm working toward here you him how
[1:14:41] about the rest of you we forget that we
[1:14:44] should always please to dwell but what
[1:14:45] if I hear you him what about you got to
[1:14:47] listen to this dummy right come on
[1:14:52] the truth anyhow
[1:15:00] obvious to get you game
[1:15:03] or to get you from like June and I took
[1:15:07] a trip to Alaska
[1:15:09] let somebody put you out in the middle
[1:15:10] of Alaska and see how long you'll
[1:15:11] survive
[1:15:13] but I felt so confident because we paid
[1:15:16] dearly for a god
[1:15:19] to guide us on those short excursions
[1:15:22] right man we went driving back up in a
[1:15:25] Wilderness in jeeps and I am really glad
[1:15:28] that that guy out front knew where he
[1:15:30] was going
[1:15:31] because that guy that was sitting beside
[1:15:32] me and June and that girl in the back
[1:15:35] didn't have a clue
[1:15:37] but we trusted the guy that was given to
[1:15:40] us right because you know what he kept
[1:15:43] going you're going to see this you're
[1:15:44] going to see that this is going to
[1:15:46] happen that deer usually come through
[1:15:48] here and they did while we were there
[1:15:50] you're right on cue I don't know if he
[1:15:51] had them for pets or something but he
[1:15:53] said they're gonna they jumped right
[1:15:54] across the road in front of us
[1:15:56] but remember listen I'm trying to make a
[1:15:59] point here right that God knows what
[1:16:01] he's doing listen to him
[1:16:04] but in our human stupidity we go no I
[1:16:07] want to go that way what if I'd have
[1:16:09] took that jeep and went off on a road
[1:16:10] going Side Road
[1:16:12] I wouldn't be here tonight
[1:16:15] they'd be one of them crosses sticking
[1:16:17] up on the side of the road you know
[1:16:18] where he died
[1:16:23] but we do have that ability though
[1:16:27] to say I'm going to go that way long
[1:16:29] enough to where God will let you go that
[1:16:30] way
[1:16:32] and I hope and pray that this brother is
[1:16:35] born again and I hope and pray that he
[1:16:37] has just said I'm going to go this way
[1:16:39] I'm going this way until God's going to
[1:16:41] tap him on the top of the head and say
[1:16:43] look buddy you either turn around and
[1:16:45] get back on track or I'm going to take
[1:16:47] you out of here
[1:16:49] now it's the same way with each one of
[1:16:50] us why do you think we're all dying
[1:16:52] because we have our own carnal idea
[1:16:56] sure we got to
[1:16:58] the purpose if we if we got the guide
[1:16:59] but are we listening to that God are we
[1:17:02] listening to the guy that says stop
[1:17:05] right here move right here we got to
[1:17:07] turn left here same way with the
[1:17:10] preaching of the gospel and and the new
[1:17:12] birth it has to connect together
[1:17:14] you have to hear
[1:17:18] right you can't get it on your own right
[1:17:21] right you got to have five
[1:17:23] folds of it
[1:17:27] all of it
[1:17:30] or you're going to get off the track
[1:17:33] now let's go and read
[1:17:35] I want you to see something Joshua 3
[1:17:40] . and I read this this morning
[1:17:44] and brother Joe helped me look this up
[1:17:47] now let me get you scene for you now
[1:17:49] what is Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:51] right right he's fixing to take them
[1:17:54] across Jordan and place them in the land
[1:17:57] very important job that was his
[1:17:58] commission the Joshua commission was to
[1:18:01] take him across and place them in the
[1:18:03] land right but he's going to take them
[1:18:05] across first he's got to get them all
[1:18:07] across before he can put them in the
[1:18:09] lands everybody with me say Amen all
[1:18:11] right that was weak and they commanded
[1:18:14] the people saying when you see the Ark
[1:18:16] of the Covenant now what is the Ark of
[1:18:17] the Covenant that's the word of God
[1:18:19] right right that was the word of God to
[1:18:21] them
[1:18:22] which was the two tables of stone in the
[1:18:25] ark when you see the Ark of the Covenant
[1:18:27] of the Lord your God and the priests the
[1:18:29] Levites bearing it the preachers
[1:18:31] and remember there was only one Ark
[1:18:36] so there was only one Doctrine right
[1:18:38] right it wasn't four or five arcs there
[1:18:39] was one
[1:18:41] and the priest of Levites bearing it
[1:18:43] then ye shall remove from your place and
[1:18:45] go after it right yet there shall be a
[1:18:48] space between you and it about 2 000
[1:18:50] cubics by measure you know how far that
[1:18:52] is
[1:18:53] that's a half a mile
[1:18:56] the reason for the separation is this
[1:19:02] come not near unto it that you may know
[1:19:05] the way by which you must go for ye have
[1:19:08] not passed this way heretofore right
[1:19:11] now that art was placed as a beacon
[1:19:14] it was placed as a guide and wherever
[1:19:17] they saw that thing that's the way they
[1:19:18] went but they kept in case anything went
[1:19:21] on during the journey it kept it was a
[1:19:23] half a mile distance
[1:19:25] because that Ark went first the word
[1:19:28] knows where to go first and Joshua said
[1:19:30] unto the people sanctify yourselves for
[1:19:31] tomorrow the Lord will do wonders
[1:19:34] among you
[1:19:35] right but you better stay a half a mile
[1:19:37] behind that Ark
[1:19:39] because you've never been this way
[1:19:40] before and that's the problem with
[1:19:42] people
[1:19:43] they've never been this way before
[1:19:45] they're lagging behind I'm talking to
[1:19:48] you and me
[1:19:51] the ark's the word
[1:19:55] remember
[1:19:56] watch what now will you bring Joshua now
[1:19:58] watch Isaiah pick the same Revelation up
[1:20:01] let's go to Isaiah
[1:20:03] 42.
[1:20:07] and I will bring the Blind by a way they
[1:20:10] knew not
[1:20:10] now is he not talking about the same
[1:20:12] thing
[1:20:13] I will lead them in past that they have
[1:20:15] not known right
[1:20:17] right what a God
[1:20:19] I will make Darkness light before them
[1:20:24] and crooked things straight
[1:20:27] these things will I do unto them and not
[1:20:29] forsake them now but if you want a
[1:20:31] promise of God you write that in your
[1:20:33] Bible
[1:20:34] I will bring the Blind by way if they
[1:20:36] knew not and all of us were blind
[1:20:39] if you're not born again you're still
[1:20:41] blind right
[1:20:43] I will lead them in past that they have
[1:20:45] not known
[1:20:47] that's the problem
[1:20:48] we got to get them born again
[1:20:50] then
[1:20:54] I will make Darkness light before them
[1:20:56] now watch this next quote
[1:21:00] Peter was led to say in Acts 2 38 this
[1:21:03] is from a God 1962. how to receive the
[1:21:06] Holy Ghost he said repent every one of
[1:21:08] you then be baptized in the name of
[1:21:10] Jesus Christ for the mission remission
[1:21:12] of your sins and then the God will take
[1:21:15] you from their own Glory
[1:21:19] there's the thing there's the going on
[1:21:21] to Perfection right the God you got to
[1:21:24] get the god in glory
[1:21:27] and then it's his job
[1:21:29] it's like I was saying about it it's
[1:21:31] mining brother Donny's job to get to
[1:21:33] Texas
[1:21:34] but once we get to Texas I hope you saw
[1:21:37] that once we get to Texas that's good
[1:21:40] the guy takes over
[1:21:44] and he'll lead you all the way through
[1:21:45] if you'll just listen to him then the
[1:21:48] God will take you from their own
[1:21:50] right yeah that's the thing to do first
[1:21:52] repent of your sins your unbelief that
[1:21:55] you've disbelieved these things repent
[1:21:57] and then be baptized then the God will
[1:21:59] take you from their own
[1:22:02] see that's your duty it's your duty to
[1:22:05] repent it's your duty to be baptized see
[1:22:09] it was my duty and Donny's duty to get
[1:22:10] in the car put gas in the car and go to
[1:22:12] Texas
[1:22:13] at least we were heading in the right
[1:22:14] direction because the God says I'm in
[1:22:16] Texas right
[1:22:18] then it's the God's Duty to take you
[1:22:21] from their own lead you from virtue to
[1:22:23] knowledge to Temperance to patience the
[1:22:25] godliness to brotherly love and the Holy
[1:22:27] Ghost seals you
[1:22:31] man let me tell you some people
[1:22:34] then you're a pure full stature of God a
[1:22:38] real man of God a real woman of God
[1:22:39] anchored away in Christ
[1:22:42] I love that that anchored away
[1:22:46] in Christ
[1:22:49] the God will take you from there on
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:52] that's the problem
[1:22:58] people wanting to go ahead
[1:23:00] they want to go their own self their own
[1:23:03] idea their own way their own knowledge
[1:23:09] I agree with the brother
[1:23:12] the Holy Ghost is being preached wrong
[1:23:13] in the message
[1:23:16] but thank God
[1:23:18] this church is not built on that right
[1:23:20] this church doesn't say brother devil
[1:23:21] doesn't say just because you come church
[1:23:23] here you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:27] the way some of us Act
[1:23:31] we ain't got to Texas yet
[1:23:37] it's the truth
[1:23:39] the truth
[1:23:41] the truth hurts
[1:23:43] right but it'll help you
[1:23:45] it's like I told them it it's the
[1:23:48] analogy I always use about the the pill
[1:23:50] we've got a pill the doctors give us a
[1:23:53] pill it says this is going to take care
[1:23:55] of all your needs this is going to take
[1:23:57] care of everything
[1:23:59] and they give you the pill
[1:24:02] and it's a capsule and it's got powder
[1:24:04] inside but it's got that
[1:24:07] what is it um
[1:24:09] glycerin or whatever that is around it
[1:24:11] that dissolves in your stomach and goes
[1:24:13] away
[1:24:14] but remember if you take it home and lay
[1:24:16] it on the Shelf
[1:24:18] and don't say do what the God tells you
[1:24:20] to do
[1:24:21] you can lay it on the shelf and you know
[1:24:23] what all y'all come to my house and I'll
[1:24:25] say that pill is going to make me better
[1:24:28] you'll bury me
[1:24:31] you'll bury me in the ground if I don't
[1:24:33] take that pill
[1:24:34] ow that's what we're doing with the word
[1:24:36] of God
[1:24:37] it's got everything you need
[1:24:40] but you got to take it and put it in the
[1:24:42] right environment right once you've
[1:24:43] taken put it in the right environment
[1:24:45] what's inside will help you right
[1:24:48] right but that's our problem
[1:24:49] we want to say oh it's good oh it's
[1:24:52] there it's oh it's there it's there for
[1:24:53] everybody it's this it'll do everything
[1:24:55] for me
[1:24:56] and then you put it right there yeah
[1:25:00] trust you God
[1:25:03] if you don't trust the god they somebody
[1:25:06] else going to guide you
[1:25:09] that's what's happening people I'm
[1:25:10] warning you look around
[1:25:13] people are leaving in droves
[1:25:16] brother Brown said sight and time was
[1:25:18] man's worst enemy here we are 50 years
[1:25:21] the prophet's gone and we still got
[1:25:23] people that ain't Born Again preaching
[1:25:24] the gospel
[1:25:26] right
[1:25:28] that's right or they wouldn't like the
[1:25:30] way they act right
[1:25:36] it's a wonderful time but it's a
[1:25:38] terrible time right
[1:25:40] right but it's a time for us to either
[1:25:41] lead follow or get out of the way like
[1:25:43] my old football coach used to say
[1:25:45] either lead follow or don't get in
[1:25:47] somebody's way
[1:25:49] our problem is we got too much of this
[1:25:51] and too much of that
[1:25:53] but I'm going to tell you something
[1:25:55] when I was down in Miami we had a few
[1:25:57] discussions
[1:25:59] and then when this come up with with
[1:26:01] Jeff Jenkins putting all this online
[1:26:03] pays one thing for sure
[1:26:06] I know where I'm supposed to be
[1:26:08] whether you do or not
[1:26:12] this church don't stand for a lot of
[1:26:14] things that goes on in churches out
[1:26:16] there
[1:26:18] this church is not built on things that
[1:26:20] they're being built on out there and
[1:26:21] it's sinking sand
[1:26:24] I believe we've had the truth
[1:26:27] amen the fullness of the word right
[1:26:30] I don't care what you like me or not
[1:26:34] but I'm gonna still come to church here
[1:26:37] and this is that yeah
[1:26:42] there's not this
[1:26:43] this is that right
[1:26:45] that was spoken of
[1:26:46] Man by Joel
[1:26:48] but you need to guide people
[1:26:50] you need to start listening to God
[1:26:53] right
[1:26:54] you know you
[1:26:56] I never meant that brother and I hope
[1:26:58] this sermon was not built around him but
[1:27:00] some of the things he said yeah it was
[1:27:02] it kind of but I was already going to
[1:27:04] speak on the god of my life because I
[1:27:07] spoke on it last Sunday at Sunday and
[1:27:09] Sunday school right brother Bob so it
[1:27:10] wasn't I didn't know I was going to
[1:27:12] preach tonight
[1:27:13] but
[1:27:15] if you don't have the guide I I promise
[1:27:18] you
[1:27:19] you will be led astray
[1:27:24] and even with the guide you can be led
[1:27:27] astray
[1:27:30] because there's two spirits in the
[1:27:32] framework of the church
[1:27:33] and you got to be able to discern
[1:27:37] which one's right
[1:27:39] but remember
[1:27:41] either they're both wrong
[1:27:43] or one of them's right they both can't
[1:27:45] be right
[1:27:47] so the two Spears in the framework of
[1:27:49] message churches right
[1:27:52] right not out there in here right
[1:27:55] right because this is where the division
[1:27:56] has become more than anything it's
[1:28:00] become a war in a battle
[1:28:03] I'm telling you go to no never mind
[1:28:08] let's stand
[1:28:11] make sure you have the guide make sure
[1:28:14] that that God tells you and you know
[1:28:17] what if something tells you one thing
[1:28:20] contrary to the word
[1:28:21] you know it's not that God right
[1:28:24] amen right
[1:28:32] right man it's time to forget
[1:28:35] not forget
[1:28:37] the principles of the doctrine we were
[1:28:39] built on right
[1:28:41] but go on to Perfection amen the Bible
[1:28:44] says the Deep things of God should be
[1:28:46] understood right and we should plainly
[1:28:48] be able to understand it because if a
[1:28:51] seventh grade man could bring it to us
[1:28:55] in so much Simplicity how can that be
[1:28:57] deep but it is deep to the ones that
[1:29:00] doesn't have the Holy Ghost sure I hear
[1:29:03] preachers all the time say oh you don't
[1:29:04] need to preach on deep things I said
[1:29:06] well you need to get the Holy Ghost
[1:29:09] because they didn't say I'll lead you
[1:29:11] and guide you into baby food right
[1:29:14] did it
[1:29:15] did say I'll keep you on milk all the
[1:29:17] time
[1:29:18] I like milk I like a good cold glass of
[1:29:21] milk
[1:29:22] but I like it with a steak about that
[1:29:23] thick
[1:29:25] right I like some steak I like some
[1:29:28] strong that's what Paul said wasn't he
[1:29:30] Paul wasn't listen Paul wasn't shy about
[1:29:34] what he was saying right
[1:29:36] he said strong me you need to be eating
[1:29:38] strong meat why are you sitting around
[1:29:39] here crying
[1:29:41] why cry we need to speak and go on right
[1:29:44] right I was using the same message as
[1:29:46] brother Dale was using about the
[1:29:48] masterpiece
[1:29:49] but man when when Michelangelo when he
[1:29:52] saw that what he had been working on for
[1:29:55] years
[1:29:56] but look the image was always in that
[1:30:00] stone right
[1:30:01] it just took a master builder or a
[1:30:05] master architect to get it out of that
[1:30:08] stone it was in that stone before the
[1:30:10] foundation of the world
[1:30:13] he had to come from somewhere right and
[1:30:15] that statue was in there well well you
[1:30:17] know what that's what God's doing as a
[1:30:18] father
[1:30:19] as a father he's looking at us and he's
[1:30:21] molding us and he's cutting this away
[1:30:23] and cutting that away he's shining this
[1:30:25] up and Shining that up one day he's
[1:30:27] going to step back and he's going to say
[1:30:29] speak
[1:30:31] see there's adoption
[1:30:34] speak right
[1:30:37] right that's what we need to see we need
[1:30:39] to see that it God is going to once he
[1:30:42] sees that image
[1:30:44] and he sees it completely finished
[1:30:48] and he rubs it and he says it wasn't see
[1:30:52] my Michelangelo was not making a statue
[1:30:55] of Michelangelo he was making a statue
[1:30:57] of Moses of someone else that was a
[1:30:59] human that was a human example that
[1:31:01] brother Brandon was using
[1:31:03] God is making an image of himself
[1:31:07] let us make man in our image there was
[1:31:09] that Genesis 1 26 man that God had in
[1:31:13] that stone that Revelation the whole
[1:31:14] time
[1:31:16] and the way to reveal it was it looked
[1:31:19] like just a piece of Rock
[1:31:23] people walk by Michelangelo and they
[1:31:25] just look and they go
[1:31:28] that just looks like a square Stone
[1:31:30] piece of Michelangelo said you just wait
[1:31:33] a little while
[1:31:34] I got something in my mind
[1:31:37] and I'm going to bring it out of that
[1:31:39] stone
[1:31:40] and I'm going to develop that picture
[1:31:42] that I saw right
[1:31:44] in my mind and God's the same way but
[1:31:47] God's not making an image of Moses right
[1:31:49] he's making an image of himself he's got
[1:31:51] a bride that's going to be there he's
[1:31:53] got a bride that he's holding that he's
[1:31:55] cutting away that he's guiding
[1:31:58] if we'll listen
[1:32:00] that's our problem
[1:32:01] sometimes we don't listen right
[1:32:03] but we need to put our listening ears on
[1:32:07] amen get excited about this thing get
[1:32:09] it's my brother now said be in a Revival
[1:32:11] right
[1:32:12] right y'all's problem is you must keep
[1:32:14] it inside them people in Miami they show
[1:32:15] theirs
[1:32:19] I almost ran with him almost did
[1:32:24] well they were running so
[1:32:27] they were happy

[1:33:09] simple just believe it
[1:33:13] y'all like this song
[1:33:15] for one reason
[1:33:18] we know who the redeemed are
[1:33:21] but there's a verse that saves the
[1:33:23] Angels
[1:33:24] they must think we're crazy
[1:33:43] well they don't have a daddy like we do
[1:33:47] they had a Creator
