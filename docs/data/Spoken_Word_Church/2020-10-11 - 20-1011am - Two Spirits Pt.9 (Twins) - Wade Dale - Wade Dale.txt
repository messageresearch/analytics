getting him well where he can come home i've missed him and i love him so much [Music] they uh yeah wake up everybody maybe you ought to do that while preaching it'll just turn them off and everybody gone but uh i know some of you had already seen that but uh brother dale only saw it on a small camera from sister uh roof so we wanted to see it liam to see it on b screen and where he could hear so anna just sent me a text and said his eyes were leaking for some reason so but god bless you let's stand our feet and get started thank you for your prayers again for by way of announcements remember we only have one service on sunday is until further notice which would be at least next sunday brother wins uh brother bob will be preaching for us wednesday he is in mobile today speaking for brother matthew bray there so pray for the family i think they're coming back tomorrow so uh and uh terence is still quarantining himself he doesn't have any symptoms so just pray for all of us though we're staying with dad at night and uh he's he's fine he's just he just needs to recover it's just we live in these bodies it's like brother howell was saying you know it's not fun getting old and it would be nice to reverse the process but you know what by the preaching of the word we're going to reverse that process amen that process to me is being done word by word by word by word all right like brother luis was talking wednesday night about the the potter uh you got to put the water to it you got to water you you can't just take a dry old dry piece of uh flesh and do anything with it it's got to be watered it's got to have the water of the word so god bless you if you would turn your bibles to first john 4. and like i said brother bob will be here with us wednesday night he'll see this or we can i'll text him a little bit later but like i said again thank you all for your prayers and for all your comments and literally around the world people were praying for for brother dale it's good to have a church body that's not just confined to these walls amen and you know we used satan's technology he gave us all the internet and all the wi-fi and all the different things but we're just going to use it to our advantage we're going to get the bride to pray just real quick for for others and you don't have to wait two or three weeks to find out some of you get instant messaging so and that's the way god is god gives us revelation that's what we want more than anything is revelation so just keep us in your prayers keep us in prayers that we'll all be we're we're doing our hand washing and i was talking to sister cleta a few minutes ago and i read an article not too long ago where now they're saying that we may be too clean that you know when we were kids i know we'd get outside and play and for those of you young kids that don't know what a tater patch is nyla's going down what are you talking about a tater patch is when you go outside and play for so long in the dirt and you sweat and you come in you got a little roll right here and it's brown and you could plant taters in it because it's dirt and mama would make sure that we would go wash that tater patch off before we did anything but you know they're saying now that we're so hand sanitized and so sanitized and so sanitized i think another day and just just a thought in your mind think how many things that are already your body's already combating i know sister ruth knows it and a lot of people that have been in the health care field your body even at night there's things working there's there's there's antibodies and there's all these different things that's fighting things off of you because we live in what we're talking about we live in this satan's eden that he would surely love to kill every one of us and everything he touches dies anyway so we are expecting though brother dale to come to complete recovery and be back in the pulpit we miss him and you know that too but there is a healing process that's got to happen so he's told me last night he said just keep everything the way it is for a while so we're just going to keep everything the way it is for a while amen so everybody okay god bless you i know there's several downstairs there's several out i think brother aaron is in uh tennessee with his family and anna and richard and the kids are there with dad uh and the reason we showed that is like i said so he could see it on big screen i know some of you have some of you hadn't but thank you for what you've done brother luis and sister christine for putting that together and all the work that everybody does around here we're just one big church family so first john 4 verse 1 let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you again today for a time that we can come and serve you father in a building to honor the resurrection that two thousand years ago lord you stepped out of that tomb and you said all power in heaven there's been given unto me but lord thank you that you didn't keep it lord you said that i'll go away but i'll come back and i'll not just be with you i'll be in you to the end of the age father we're coming up to the end of this age and lord we know that you have not left us there are things that look like maybe that that that we question a lot in our humanity that are going on but lord as we've said many times before the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord so you have complete control lord of everything that goes on father we still cry out lord for healing for ones that are not here by the kali all the different ones that are in the sanctuary lord pastor lord and different ones mom we pray that you touch them father and just keep on that healing process lord and we pray that you would be with the be with the bride around the world as we see many many prayer requests coming in that this virus is hitting a lot of people in different places lord we pray for mercy lord and we pray that you'll cover us by your blood father be with the people here lord give them strength let us bind together closer to you lord and take care of us in the furthermore this service we ask in jesus name amen first john 4 verse 1 says beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god and every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world like i said that's 2 000 years ago year of god little children have overcome them because greater is healeth in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error that's the two spirits or two seeds we've been talking about and we're gonna try to get to where we talk about twins so you may be seeing the lord's blessing to the reading of the word let's go to the first quote and read it again brother claude and i were talking yesterday or day before yesterday and he's kind of on the same subject but he's covered under demonology we know there's only one demon and there's only one god all right there are many demons under that demon and there are many helpers under the lord jesus christ we know there's angels there's all the diff but you know where his helpers are today right here this is his family this is what's going to destroy the effects of the devil is you and me in human flesh today by just getting up and coming to church you have defeated the devil amen by just getting up and saying i really don't feel i'm going on i really i'm going on see you've done right there you you have done what you've separated those two spirits and you know that you have the spirit of truth by coming to church or the spirit of error by putting something else in the way of that all right and it has to be a demon because god's not going to tell you not to come to church all right so now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it look what it's doing now it's coming into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word think about all that the discrediting of god's word look what's happening now even in the message of the hour they're discrediting the word of god all right they're not saying that it's god it's nothing they're not saying it's false they're just discrediting it saying well it may be for something else somebody else is coming or we got another message and anyway that's antichrist spirit all right now look it's not the antichrist it's the antichrist spirit because we know it's going to head up when we get finished down the line we know that that heads up in one person amen well i read it over there in revelations uh yesterday 17 18 19 read over in there you see this beast that comes up upon the earth and this beast is going to give power and we'll cover that long time from here but we need to get to these 22 to the twins because remember brother brown said there's twins in every revival he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for all right you got to stand for something and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church not out there right here christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her let's read the second one it's also an exposition of the seven church ages did you get it now there are these twins again there are those two trees again remember there was a tree of life and a tree of knowledge of good and evil always those two right growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain and benefiting by the same son but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god and exactly as god gave it and loves it and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas for the living true word of god exactly as did cain who ended up killing abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan what about that that's pretty powerful quote all right so we see that there's two opposing spirits now but god when he comes up we've been in the garden of eden for a long time and maybe we'll try to get out of it today but being we don't have but one service we know that god set up a plan before the foundation of the world he knew what was gonna happen he he by four knowledge everything was already he could see what was coming he knew what adam and eve would do he knew what satan was gonna do lucifer was gonna do when he created him and he knew that the plan that he had was perfect because god doesn't have to go back and change his plan so whatever this is that happened and that's why you and i got to get a true revelation of every step of all this that happened because that's where we get a true revelation because right here in the garden of eden man by their knowledge changed the bible right from the beginning the original word of god says that adam and eve in the garden of eden without sex there was a beast there and the beast the satan entered the beast defiled eve had relations with her then had relations with adam and then those twins were born now see man changed all that man did god never changed it man changed it man changed it and said no it was an apple then it was an apricot then we don't know what this is and we don't know where this is have we don't know what's happening but we do because we had a prophet to come and walk into the mind of god that the mind of god was there before the foundation of the world because it was part of god and we we as recipients of what the prophet gave us could go back into the back part of god's mind with the prophet of god he didn't go into the mind of god and then come out and shut the door he brought what he had what he saw he brought that mind of god christ the mystery god revealed all god was deported to christ christ into where you and me the church take her back to the garden of eden take her literally take her back to where man before man got a hold of this word and what made it powerless made it formal cold and powerless oh they just ate an apple and we really don't know but all of a sudden they had to put on clothes and all of a sudden you had a you had a set of twins born and and all they must have been from adam because uh eve said i've gotten a man from the lord and you understand what i'm saying you see how they preached all that now that wasn't god that did that that was satan that did that satan preached that sermon in the minds of people down through the ages and they just believed it same thing with the trinity same thing with all this different water baptism that never come from the mind of god that's why when brother branham went into the mind of god and got the information it wasn't a denominational idea it was what god said and that's what he brought it and he said this is what god said this is what was in the mind of god so you and i because listen without a revelation we can't go back into that mind of god because the mind of god is a revelation the mind of god is not just pieces you know you can read this and and listen when i was 14 years old i knew what happened in the garden of eden by reading what brother brown said and just studying science and knowing that there was a missing link and and knowing that that being 14 years old you get to thinking things different than you did when you was five or six years old you understand what i'm saying so you really knew what satan was doing and where he started at he started in my the mind of eve or because remember if you keep we keep going here we got to remember and we'll read it in a little while there's also two wombs amen there's two wombs you have a womb in your mind and you have a natural physical womb all right so what did satan get to first he got to eve's mind the womb of her mind because what did gabriel do when he come and met mary he got in he got the womb of mary's mind to thinking because the first thing mary said she said how can this happen now that came from up here how can this happen i'm 16 years old and i pretty much know how everybody got here on the face of the earth what are you telling me he said it'll come from the holy ghost and she got a revelation that she was the one because she remembered isaiah 9 said a virgin shall conceive so that seed that spiritual seed was planted in her womb first up here before the natural seed could happen in mary's natural womb so that's the way you and i now remember you and i are what we are women in the body all of us i've uncovered this before we are all women in the body of christ amen so we have a womb that we have here and that's the womb that satan is after because once he gets this one he's got everything else right because the body just follows behind but listen satan was so smart he was standing there and he saw what god said look we're going to go right here to the law of reproduction because the law of reproduction it has two distinct meanings now watch on the law of reproduction genesis 1 11 says and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind of the tree yielded fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind now that's natural seed everybody got that say man that's natural seed the animals were told to to repopulate the world by natural seed sperm and egg coming together and making babies everybody got that all right but now when we come to genesis 1 26 that is not a natural seed that is spiritual genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our image never in this genesis 1 26 i was thinking about this yesterday from genesis 1 26 to 1 28 there is no natural relations involved because there's not even a natural man you're looking at you're looking at a spirit man remember brother brown said god created man and he created man of spirit first all right let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and old foul that's good because you know what that's adam that's what adam and eve did they took over the world but god told them the same thing he told the animals the animal's natural the trees natural the grass natural there is a natural seed have you ever thought about that law of reproduction is still going today even in the natural that god set forth 6 000 years ago it's still happening every day we today we see the leaves falling on the trees the seeds are dying but what's happening the pine tree lets go of that seed and it goes and it goes into the ground it sits there for a little while during the winter time because there's no warmth to bring it out of the ground but because of that law of reproduction come about march you see a little green chute come up you don't see nothing you just see barren ground and implanting planting uh garden this year you know you plant that garden and you go man i don't know i don't know but all of a sudden what you planted in that row it starts popping its head up so there's the law of reproduction and if you've got hybrid seed it won't reproduce but if you got some heirloom seed or seed that you can re sow then that seed is in itself now let me ask you a question is that so different now when we talk about the spiritual man the seed that god wanted to bring forth from adam and eve was already in adam not natural spiritual the spoken word is the original seed adam i was talking about this a couple weeks ago adam was a literal spoken seed word of god he didn't come from another mom and daddy he didn't come from a a a a sperm in a or a german an egg coming together he came let there be right here so god created man in his own image and the image of god created to him male and female created he them all right so he's going to have a male and a female in this human race but remember their spirit right now spiritual nothing natural and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and what multiply the law of reproduction but satan perverted that law and turned it back into this other law everybody with me not god satan took this right here because why did what did satan preach to eve god told you to multiply and when he put him in human flesh then he could just say all right eve you're the woman and i'm the man and you understand what i mean be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth and subdue it now remember we're heading toward that again i was reading i love that revelations 19 when when god comes riding back with his saints that's not everybody that's us comes riding back into the millennium all this other thing and what we're going to do is brother brown said we would subdue the earth in the millennium because right now obviously we're not subduing much of anything right but now god promised us in romans 8 that there would be a manifestation of the sons of god when the earth is groaning so you'll see it in a small portion in the bride i believe real quick because we're going to need it if anything worse than this comes folks we're going to need more than just doctors hello we're going to need what spoken word we're going to need manifestation of the sons and daughters of god but god promised we would have it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and all the fowl of the air now listen we have dominion over the animal kingdom now but it's a fear dominion because we're going to get to it in just a minute where there was no fear until god walked in the garden and adam and eve did what they did first word that come out of adam's mouth i was afraid afraid afraid of what he had named all the animals he'd moved trees around probably if he didn't like this mountain he just slid it over to this side he had complete control like i said adam was not an idiot adam was the son of god he was the closest thing to god besides god because he and then god said when god look brother by the way brother brown said one time he said when god gives you something he don't take it back so he said you have dominion over the fish of the sea follow the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth be fruitful though and multiply well see so satan took that and said okay i know that's the plan of god because he's listening to it when it's happening right here he's listening to it he said okay i know but but i know god said before you see how satan is i hate to think like him but sometimes you have to think like him you know to see what his plan is but you know one thing's for sure he said all right he told him to do that but now these people right here this group must be special god's not letting me get involved in any of that satan's not involved in that group of people folks he's involved in all the world he is not involved in the bride of jesus christ he is not involved in the children of god he involves himself with the children of god trying to get us to mess up but he does have nothing to do with our spiritual growth thank god he has nothing to do with anything in your soul he can't take it away he can't make it not eternal when you get eternal life god give it to you and you're sure amen but that's what he's saying right here so satan is going i know what i'll do i'll make him mess up so that's what he did because he remember what god did he took this man and put him on the earth and gave him a body as as brother louise was talking wednesday night he the potter throwed the clay on the wheel and started turning the wheel and here come adam and then he placed that genesis 1 26 man inside of heaven of adam and gave him the dominion over the fish of the sea so if you'll remember one thing's for sure god never wanted us to reproduce the way we reproduce now okay so get that out of your head but he did allow it to get us here so that we can make our choice because of what happened in the fall i like what one preacher said one time he said he said god was getting ready to produce sons and daughters of god and satan all he done was he marred eve's womb then he marred her natural womb and god can't bring a son of god out of that but he didn't he satan said i've done it i've stopped him he can't do it he's got to do it he's got to give listen he had to give cain a life satan knew that satan knew that when he got in that beast and the beast did what he did to eve that because of the law of reproduction before here not this one but the one before he knew god had to honor that because he knew there's one thing i think satan knows is that god pretty much does what he says he's going to do all right so he knew that once he got those seed natural seeds together he could inject himself into the human race that's where you get your seeds from right so god always wanted to be spiritual satan's always been carnal so he used that and brought us into the carnal but what did god do god said okay satan you've got adam and eve and you know what i got to drive them out of the garden of eden we'll see in a few minutes i got to drive them out of the garden of eden and said but you know what you just temporarily stopped a son and daughter of god from being born because in genesis 3 15 he opens it all back up and we'll read it in just a few minutes okay it's that see if god hadn't said in genesis to me genesis 3 15 is probably one of the most important scriptures in the whole as as far as our importance because it gives us a chance come on folks we had no chance when cain and abel were conceived in the womb of eve you and i had no chance as being born again believers we had natural life because every seed had to bring forth of its kind everyone gets together but to come bring you back into that right there you couldn't do it by yourself god had to come and open the door to go back to that amen that's what he did when he came being the seed of the woman all right everybody good say amen all right number three let's read this one now i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever believe now in the beginning god made man in his own image and god is a spirit and god made man spirit man then he made him in the dust of the earth now believe that man in the beginning well led the animals of the earth like the holy spirit ought to be leaving leading the church today so let me ask you a question though don't be so carnal to think that adam was just some floating spirit adam was a man god was a man god wait a minute god still is a man all right so he was walking but you know what i don't think he was constrained with with with movement he didn't have to have a car or he could just be on the other side of the earth didn't brother brown say travel like a thought amen travel like a thought that's what we're all going back to now do you think when we get into that new city that we're going to have to call uber no you know what if brother john and i have never been to mars we'll just say hey we'll be back in a few years we'll be in mars standing there amen and just sit down on a rock and talk about whatever we want to talk about see we're so limited here but what did brother brown show us on the countdown if you'll read that message it's really good especially now because of the pressure that's being put on us but god pressurized you to do this but he made us astronauts he didn't he didn't make us earthbound he made us to where we could travel like a fog and god made man spirit man then he made him in the dust of the earth now i believe that man at the beginning well led the animals of the earth like the holy spirit ought to be leading the church today like i said before here was adam adam named all the animals every one of them so they were they were um comfortable lions tigers all the different ones they were comfortable with walking up to adam they were comfortable living together because god told them to multiply and replenish but he said you need to eat the grass and herbs and all the different things in the ground don't you think listen god knew what every creature needed to eat he knew whatever creature needed for for a place to rest and he put it there what do you think we're going back to line will be gentle amen we don't know that though see we've we've all been grown up knowing that and i've always said before all these people that think we're in the millennium that are in the message is a bunch of baloney all i got to do is take them down to the zoo and i won't throw them into the lion's den because if you're in the millennium they're not going to eat you he'll get a revelation real quick that we're still here under the curse but you know what though what did god do god all down through time and even now i've heard the brothers in different places and all where like brother branham the hornet and the and the bull and what did they meet they didn't meet william branham that came from charles and elle brown the bull would have killed him he meant that genesis 1 26. he met that genesis 1 26 man which is the same man that's in you today sometimes what gets us first is our fear brother brown said if i had a gun i'd have shot him what that humanity rose up in brother branham because he knew that bull had killed two or three people before and here he was walking in the territory and brother brown being a naturalist and knowing about that he knew he was in that bull's house and he knew what that bull would do but what happened he said something took over now folks that was at genesis 1 26 man that adam from the beginning took over and said oh i'm sorry hornets he didn't get mad at him we start swatting at him and please don't do that being a beekeeper the best thing to do is to make something put your hand in your pocket this is the defense mechanism to a bee or a bug or anything don't do that put your hands in your pocket and just move out of the way most of the time they don't want they don't want to bother you they either want to just check you out just see how you see how you're doing that day you know and you may be having a bad day sometimes and they continue that bad day with a few stings but uh but what am i saying is there that nature that adam had is the same holy ghost nature that you should have today according to that because i believe adam was a full-grown son of god okay he didn't know the seals and he didn't know all these things that we do now because of the fall coming down but he was complete ruler of the whole earth so he like said he wasn't an idiot he knew that's why brother brown many times we read it before her brother brown said uh adam knew what he was doing eve was deceived and we covered that last sunday i hope it didn't hurt anybody's feelings i hope it kind of helped us all a little bit to to see that we can listen we're still deceived anything contrary to the mind of god is a deception even in the message you have false doctrine and all these different things and not just humanity i'm talking about doctrinal wise if it's wrong folks it didn't come from god that's pretty simple all right so now let's go to genesis 2 7 and the lord formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathing in his nostrils the breath of life now who was standing there satan was standing right there lucifer was watching this whole thing because he knew he couldn't get to that spirit man i believe i believe that satan listen by the baptism of the holy ghost he can't get to your soul either he can try to influence in your memory reason conscious effects and imagination that's his playground and if you don't know that by now you're in trouble you don't have a white dog black dog in you that's fighting because that's what's fighting remember the old indian said i have in me now because if you're not born again you're just you're just the black you're just you're just dark inside your soul is just dingy dark but by the baptism of holy ghost what happens you drive the devil out i say you you have to make a choice but you drive the devil out well where is he going to go the bible says he goes out and walks in dry places and comes back oh the day i got born again the next day he was back amen what was he working at though he wasn't trying to get in your soul because it was sealed i'm telling you folks you better be happy that satan can't get to your soul god preserved that genesis 1 26 man that we're talking about here he was going to multiply that genesis 1 26 man didn't matter what satan did didn't matter how dark he made it didn't matter even through the dark ages god filled a group of people with that same genesis 1 26 man and god was happy to see them go through and be fed the lines not saying happy but you don't know what i'm saying they had to fulfill a characteristic of every church age all right okay everybody good well then wake up and the lord for a man out of the dust of the ground we need i think we're gonna start having church at about 12 and i'll let y'all sleep till by 11 and then we'll oh lord and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed in his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground may the lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to sight and good for food now remember that's the colon there he didn't plant the tree of life he was the tree of life he was telling them where he was the tree of life is jesus christ or christ everybody got that and what's the other one three of knowledge of good and evil is the devil now you see brother branham he brings it a lot closer because he brings it when eve got her knowledge she became the tree of knowledge of good and evil all right because we protect whatever you partake of that's what you are all right so let's go to the next genesis 2 15 and the lord took the man and put him in the garden of eden and dressed at the keeping the lord of god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may freely eat he didn't even say he couldn't eat the tree of life that's not excluded only one tree is excluded but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat or what partake of when you see that word eat in that in this instance here partake do not partake of that all right because i i was thinking the other day we we talked about that word eat and what happened because there were some questions about that but brother brown said you and i are eating off the body word of the son of man we're not we're feeding we're we're partaking we're indulging in the body of the son of man we're not vampires we're taking off the what there's too much natural going on for us to see the spiritual part of this that's the same thing with here we see all the natural things and we don't see the spiritual part thou shalt not eat of it or even partake of it for in the day that thou eatest or partaketh thou shalt surely die now see that there is your conditional covenant remember now we live under an unconditional covenant but he lived under a conditional covenant adams you do this you'll be fine you do this you'll die knowing that adam was going to partake of this but being a savior a healer and a redeemer and all these different attributes he had to allow adam to come to this place be put in flesh because brother branham said that satan knew that as soon as god put them in human flesh god knew they were going to fall and satan's just sitting there waiting because once that human flesh showed up he said huh i can work on that because god told them to multiply and they're just in animal flesh i mean you and i have no different i mean sure we can't commingle with them but back then you had a beast okay but the tree of knowledge is going to be thou shalt not friend the day thou eat us thou shalt surely die there we go back to that day that one of the sisters was asking about the day well now see remember if brother brown said eve thought she got by with something because god didn't kill her the day that she did what she did that's not talking about a 24-hour day john was in the lord's day on the isle of patmos forever how many years he was there he was in the lord's day okay give us this day our daily bread i always pray that give us this day not this 24-hour day give us this day that i'm on the earth my life for in the day that i'll eat there thou shalt surely die so what they thought they got by with it but god knew nobody was going to live a thousand years because a thousand years the day and day is a thousand years everybody got that all right and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a help meet so in other ways what did he do he made him somebody equal with him genesis 3 1. now listen so what do you do he made eve he brought a flesh of adam put it here made a woman he did his pottery thing again took another little bit of clay boy you ought to watch i mean really if you ever that was kind of an elementary thing i i grew up in pottery right there across from my house and man they you think there's no way they can take maybe about that much clay and they'll make what they call a strawberry jar and what you do is you plant strawberries it's got holes in the sides of it and they'll mold that thing up and they'll bring it all the way up now the jar will be this big and this big around now that one little bit of clay watch what god did to me and you and like the analogy was when you start you start pressing on the inside you got to have pressure on the inside to create a place for god to be or for the water to be so now we come up to the serpent the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field now we know that he's an upright walking creature he looks kind of like man kind of like monkey everybody got that same man all right looks like a little bit like man a little bit like monkey he don't look like snake he turns into snake but he's a walking upright creature that has somewhat intelligence but not a man he can't be have a soul brother brown said he had a place for one in other words he didn't have a place he had a place in creation because he was the closest thing to man and what did satan do and somebody was talking the other day we were talking i believe i believe the serpent or the beast was uh he was kind of a house man and woman he kind of helped help adam and eve you know talk to the animals and they probably were around each other a lot so satan goes found me something satan's right there he ain't off somewhere playing no he's right here today playing in your mind in my mind keeping us from listening to the word of god just like he was there because he starts talking he steps in vicariously he anoints that beast everybody got that he anoints that beast and then he just the beast just yields itself because he's an animal and satan just starts talking and it's not like hey how do i talk to you no no no same voice the same voice that the beast used the whole time satan's not a dummy he just says oh hey eve good morning you having a good day today yeah have a good day hey have you noticed what the animals are doing out there you know i kind of heard that god wanted you to do the same thing and and there's nothing going on here let me show you how it's done wouldn't you think that would be it yeah so he said unto the woman yeah god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden now remember we spoke on that what you talking about her you don't touch her fruit in the midst everybody understand what i'm talking about without being graphic but of the tree of the because see listen eve wasn't an idiot either she could watch what was going on she was co-equal with adam she was trying to understand but what she did is she got ahead of the program she got ahead of the program god's program was adam speak to eve have children bring this genesis 1 26 into being eve's like i think i'll listen to this guy because we'll get it we got a new revelation we read this to you the other day but of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall need of it neither shall you touch it so it's not a literal tree we know what that is lest you die the serpent said of the woman you shall not surely die right there change the whole aspect of the conversation because what did it do that knot went into eve's womb up here and she got to thinking well maybe i won't maybe i won't die brother brown said she fell on jesus christ being the same yesterday today and forever what he said was what he meant and what he meant what he said she said oh i think i'll take that for god doesn't know that in the day you eat the other then your eyes shall be opened you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired i've never seen one like that out in the woods and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did partake or did eat and gave also into her husband with her and he did eat now this is brother brown said that the the devil met her in the morning and she had to find adam or something for the afternoon of the evening to present it to him because he partook of it but now remember like i said before there's a lot went on between that time that's not just not saying because adam realized what she had done but what was she doing she was so zealous isn't that sometimes that you and i we do the same thing and i believe that's what when we come to places in our lives that we make mistakes why do we make mistakes we get zealous and we want to do something outside of god's program or we want to try to push the program or try to make this happen i know it's with me i mean the things i want i want them now patience is a virtue i'm just being honest and so but what do i do i mess up why do i mess up i go out further than what god told me to do eve to me she formulated that in her mind and said okay if i do this and then i get adam then we'll be doing what god told us to do how beautiful but deadly how beautiful is that though same way with the denominations i believe when when that satan there at nicea satan was there he was formulating this whole plan and he just kept putting what little seeds into the womb of those men's mind at nicea and he says what about this and those prophets there brother ramsay those prophet true word of god prophet stood there and tried their best to get them to stay with the word of god and they wouldn't have nothing of it they said oh jesus well he can't be god but he could be a like substance he he could be a son of a and then what about this holy ghost that was the devil doing that folks you see how slick he was he wasn't out in the bar rooms he was sitting there in that nice city council in control fully in control because that's what man accepted and it was nothing to do with god not even in the bible a trinity and the baptism but what did god do he winked at the ignorance of those men and allowed it to continue to go but he had to restore by this end time prophet he had to bring all of it back to before nicea before all that to where jesus christ walked on the face of the earth and there was the seat of the woman there was the thing that was going to not not sexually bring us back but spiritually spoken word seed was what was going to bring us back because how did jesus come spoken word seed amen through the womb of a virgin how could that happen she said but she said be it unto me the day you got born again i'll guarantee you you said i can't this and i'm two and i i stood right here and did the same thing i've done this i've done that i can't do this i can't this i'm i'm i'm i'm god had to shut you up clear your mind the womb of your mind because then you had to you just stand right here and say god if you need healing today if you need to baptize my holy ghost you say god i'm an empty vessel i got all this junk running through the womb of my mind and i want you to plant a seed of your word in my mind and then i'm going to let it fall down here you say oh it's too simple that's how it all happens but you got to believe listen mary had to believe not for just instant sisters she had to wait to her next 28-day cycle if you understand what i mean to even no but she just said being unto me according to thy word i'm right here give it to me i i'm isaiah 9 6 is going through my what the womb of my mind somebody's got to fulfill that and satan's over there going hey you don't know no man that's what she said right she said how can i do this now see that was still satan up here putting doubt how can i do this knowing no man and gabriel just walked her through every bit of it she said he said you'll be overshadowed by the holy ghost and so that thing formed in you will be the son of god and i believe that god then turned and went right to mary and planted that seed of isaiah 9 6. listen you and i get born again by the word of god you're not born again by grier's almanac or some some good saying from charles dobson and he makes good sayings i'm not saying anything about him but you got born again because you realize you were lost by what some preacher told you out of the word of god you're not right you're doing not doing this you're not doing that the word tells you to do this that's god planting the seed word into your womb of your mind than to let it drop down to right here this is where it does good because satan can still plant one up here this womb is closed if you got the holy ghost everybody got that right i believe that's what adam knew about eve that if he didn't do something her womb was going to close up and she was going to be in big trouble because she was fixing to bring forth a man from a beast or a baby from a beast but that's just me i don't have no quotes on that but adam knew he couldn't just stand there he had to do something jesus christ knew he couldn't just stand there he had to do something he said i'll put in my tea we'll read it in just a minute everybody okay i know some of you are asleep but you know what just sleep on i can't make if i can't get you excited nobody can for god to know that the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil she didn't know evil then now she knows evil what the carnal mind is what enmity to god the carnal mind is that division between this person i'm not saying you got two people but from this person this born again and the person you walk around in all day the spirit part of you of your memory reason conscious effects and imagination all right and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and pleasant to the eye tree to be desired another word sheep or took give it to adam and the eyes of them both were open they knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons let's go to first timothy 2 verse 12. it says but i suffer not a woman to teach nor earthship authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression we talked about that last sunday so let's go to the word deceive yep go to the next right there to cause to accept as truth are valid what is false or invalid if you're deceived you think what you've got is truth eve thought what she did was what god wanted her to do all those at nicea being motivated by satan though eve being motivated by satan not motivated by god motivated by satan thought they were what getting new revelation oh you prophets go back and eat your herbs and what do you mean jesus was god and only one and what do you mean that uh jesus told us we read the writings of matthew where he said baptize in the name of father son and holy ghost and then old prophet says yes but you're not reading the word you're not getting a true revelation what is his name of the father and the son and the holy ghost and they said ah you're false what they thought they were right but satan knowing that it was wrong see that's the deception i wrote read the scripture in matthew 6 verse 22 i i even cautioned myself when you read the scripture i cautioned myself you should caution yourself the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single the whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness now wait a minute but you're but watch if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness who's he talking to he's talking to pharisees and sadducees they thought they were right we be abraham's seed we have moses as our prophet we got moses quote book but jesus is telling him said look what's in you is darkness you think it's light how much greater deception is it because we're going to read a quote in a minute where brother brown said eve got new thoughts she got new light all right so we're going to read that here in just a minute number four position of believer in christ but the misunderstanding was they thought i'd said that adam never sinned but adam did sin but he did it with his eyes wide open in timothy 3 verse we just read it it said that adam was not deceived but the woman being to see was in the transgression see eve actually thought she was right so you understand you understand what i'm trying to tell you it's not this dirty act that we have formulated in our mind it's what happened between eve and the beast she thought she was in the process of fulfilling what god had said because it wasn't so out of the normal by watching the animals procreate everybody got that eve actually thought she was right but satan deceived her but he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife like i said before it was adam had to dig real deep in his love for that woman after what she did so it wasn't filial love that work goes in memories and conscious affection and imagination it was the agape love that god had put in him of that genesis 1 26 man that said i can't kill her he didn't kill you did he no eve actually thought she was right but satan deceived her but he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife he represented himself with sin and was condemned by the same and cast out of the garden of eden you know probably in adam's mind he was saying well now if i can just if i can just protect her some way god won't kill her but he wound up both of them dying right just like jesus christ he knew we're dying he knew we were dead he says well i got to go die too that's what he did jesus christ came down here and died in human literally died in human flesh his human flesh died all right cast out of the garden of eden but what what happened when jesus came the right way he's going to head us back into the garden of eden all right let's look at number five but what what's the thing brother brown god is looking and trying moving begging persuading to find a little heart that he can come into and coo and make love to that's what he did with mary mind right how he took adam and eve before the world was before sin came into the world look at adam what a beautiful type adam and eve was the type of christ in the church now remember eve did not sin adam sinned that's right not eve adam's sin see not eve she was the one who did the act but adam done the sinning the woman was deceived the bible said she was deceived she thought she was right but adam knowed it was wrong see and now look when adam saw eve had sinned and had done wrong adam walked right out not deceived but with both eyes open he grabbed her and he walked out of the garden of eden but he so loved eve that he took her place and death with her and walked out with her so see it like i said before it wasn't a it wasn't an act of sex between adam and eve that saved her it actually killed them both it ain't some righteous something adam did when he placed a literal seed you understand what i mean you can't say that i don't know what so you see the devil's got into people's minds in this message we've heard it from some well-known people that wasn't god that said that i'm not saying anything about the brothers but that wasn't a true statement adam didn't place his literals listen i read you a quote the other day where brother brown said adam seed is what polluted the world woman don't have a seed adam's literal seed is what killed abel saith and all the way down sorry a sex act don't save you that's what's killing us you understand what i mean not that that's wrong in its right place it's right all right but what's killing us though is a carnal mind jesus remember watch with jesus when he walked on earth remember he didn't have a carnal mind why he didn't have no daddy to look back to he didn't have no mama he didn't have a genealogist he just said before abraham was i am that was an eternal mind of god which now by the new birth is coming to me and you to take care of this carnal mind which is that enmity with god all right all right let's go to number six please let's go to the red down where the red is eve actually thought she was right she was getting some new light that satan was giving her just like he walked into nicaea and was going to give them some new life well that's just old stuff that's 300 jesus died 300 years ago and he he came back yeah well just like today like brother brown you know he said that everything everything ended with the now brother brown said people said that that everything ended with the apostles you know apostolic age was not now what that's the devil telling them that now same thing and i said i said oh that's all over with we got new light coming well whose light was it that light in them was darkness but you know what they just kept going right on they brought a pope they just kept building it up bible talk calls them children of disobedience brother brown says he says a child can't deceive you but when that child grows up he can deceive you that's why it's going to be the beast in the end a full-grown man that's going to take over all right and we're not going to be here to see it but we know who it is number seven please this is where we were talking about the holy ghost veil now notice she pulled off the holy veil to see what sex really was compare that what lush really would do she pulled the veil from off of her eyes the holy thing that god had put over her eyes she wanted knowledge to know what it was all about so she pulled the veil off to see what it was all about she listened to the devil and noticed what a place that put her in they have done the same in each age it didn't just happen back there see when i was 14 years old and i was reading the message books i got a carnal human knowledge of what brother branham was talking about but i put it back under because i didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost but now with the baptism of the holy ghost you can see that that serpent seed and that satan's eating and all is all right down here and it carries on after we leave satan continues even i was reading yesterday even at the end of the thousand years satan still thinks he can gather enough people to defeat us and then that's when god says not uh we all need to move out of the way because this fixing to get ugly you know you thought atomic bomb a thousand years ago was ugly this is going to be real ugly you just stay right over here and i'm going to take care of all i'm going to kill the demons i'm going to kill them i'm going to take care of every one of them and then the new city what happens here we come right down that new city there ain't a devil nowhere oh man she listened to the devil and noticed what a place it put her in they have done the same thing in each age thereafter always taking the intellectual side and has now built a kingdom of satan knowledge his seed that he sowed and has took the world to be an eden of death now notice now look at revelations 3 the lao to see in church age you think it in your mind now notice she eve is satan's queen see satan the serpent got to eve before adam got to her that's right so he beguiled her see so satan the serpent was the husband of eve before adam ever knew now we know that see he beguiled her the bible said he did and she knowed she was naked then see he's somebody layout to see in church age which is wretched and miserable naked blind and don't know it see that light that they think they have is darkness and what's the darkest age this age because what the most light is here all right if that light in you be darkness now i'm not talking about it out there i'm talking about in this christian church brother brown said the framework of the christian church now look at the laodicean church age eve sitting at satan's queen she is rich in worldly goods blind naked again and don't know it just like it was in god's eden but now not because the holy veil is over her face but the lust veil that she took off god's holy veil and put on a veil of knowledge for lust and now she has a lust veil that she is blind to it being seen she is naked on the street and don't know it i was thinking you know just look at what people do to their self on the street and that are sitting in denominational churches tattoos earrings you understand what i mean the markings that they've marked their self with do you think anybody else is going to church today for the wrong reason no they got out just like you did thinking that their baptist preacher methodist preacher pentecostal preacher message preacher is going to give them a seed word of revelation where's the deception is that they're getting fed if you ever want to re you think you think sometimes we get strong read god of this evil age and satan's eden brother brown says they're out there in those denominational churches worshiping satan thinking they're worshiping god hands raised singing praise and worship brothers reading out of the same bible that you and i read out of and they're worshiping the devil and don't know it could we be doing the same thing can we be doing the same thing but we've been given the pure word of god folks straight from the mind of god to a little prophet to me and you and it's being done by the holy ghost and the holy ghost is never wrong listen the holy ghost never told evil to do what she did satan that unholy spirit told eve what to do put on a lust veil but you know what that didn't that didn't stop god's plan that was part of it so don't get discouraged because look right here it's where i want to get to we get to twins sometime and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden cool today and adam and his wife hid themselves now listen at this point in time she was already defiled she had two literal she had taken the seed of the womb of her mind from satan she had already had the natural act with the beast and then she had the natural act with adam so she had a set of twins in her at that point in time did everybody understand that say amen natural all right because what you got to do is when we're talking about that genesis 1 and genesis 1 4 is let every seed bring forth of its kind but then you've got that spiritual part that's up here every seed bring forth of its kind the genesis 1 26 man is not sexual what did satan do he brought this down and put it over here but god just said that's okay i'm going to have these kids anyway these are my children i'm going to have them anyway it may have to be by where brother brown says this one bread to this one this and bread to this one 4 000 people of a generation to get you here to get you here because you were part of that genesis 1 26 don't you think god's in control every aspect so the her divorce the lord god walking in the garden to cool the day and adam's wife hid himself from the presence of the lord among the trees of the garden there they go getting in trees again and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him for arthur he didn't have to ever do that before but remember god knew where he was god knew what they'd done but look at this gracious god he's going to let adam and eve confess what they did didn't you and i have to confess what we did god knew what we did from the foundation of the world he knew what we were going to do but he wanted you to confess it out of your mouth from the womb of your mind and confess it so that he can clear it out and put that womb in your heart i mean that seed in your heart amen he called in the lamb and said where are thou he said i heard that voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and god said who told you you were naked see he's trying to get he's telling adam's got to make a confession here hast thou eaten of the tree wherever i commanded thee that thou should has not eat and the man said the woman whom thou giveth to be with me she gave me of the tree and i didn't eat there's one quote where brother brown says they do they're doing like the army they're passing the buck because adam did he said she she she gave it to me and the lord god said another woman what is it that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go in other words boom he became a what a snake a serpent that we realized today remember they asked brother brown said well where is he today well he's right there he's in that snake line somewhere because that's where god put it he put him in that snake line so man couldn't find him and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity now there's one definition there's there's a couple of definitions one definition for enmity is we'll read it in a minute but i'm gonna do this and then we'll go through it it's a mutual hatred or ill will and what does that cause though a division birds of a feather flock together if you don't like my i ain't gonna go to your house and if you don't like my i ain't gonna go to your house and you understand what i mean if you don't like my doctrine i'm not gonna go to your church hello right but god said i will put enmity between thee who is thee the serpent the and the woman that's standing here right there's going to be a division listen it's not going to be this woman cannot bring forth my children the children of god like i wanted in genesis 1 26 but right here i will put enmity a division there's not going to be any more the remember the surface now snake and he's got a different whole different kind of dna right there is no more dna of the beast it's like it's in cane now actually everybody got that king's body came from that beast so where you see all these neanderthals and the men that look that's where it came from it didn't come from abel abel like adam you ever thought of that you should because cain looked different than abel ain't no they had two different seeds two different daddies and the woman i'm gonna put a division in between thy seed and her seed now remember her seed don't have a seed so he's saying what there's the promise that i'm going to give this woman a seed not from human instrumentality or male instrumentality but from what the spoken word of god and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel speaking of calvary where he struck the head of satan at calvary but look to me and you and all of the world it looked like that jesus christ was nothing just a normal man they caught doing something and threw him up on a cross and he's crying why thou forsaken me and he's saying this and he's saying that to the world it just looked like another thief satan was just laughing but he wasn't laughing a few days later he wasn't laughing when that same man showed up at his doorstep and said hey i've come to uh get the keys here i need the keys i need the keys uh you don't need them anymore because i've destroyed what you have thought you've set up i have destroyed your kingdom what by the woman's seed what a promise right there if god didn't do this he couldn't have come if he didn't say that because remember god does what he says and says what he does because what did he do it put in enmity there was no other son of god born from adam all the way to jesus christ no one everyone was born wrong and did not have a part of that genesis 1 26 and 27 man in their soul in the old testament they were covered by bulls and goats they were covered their sin was covered but not done away with right here this seed of the woman is going to do away with that serpent with that serpent seed that you and i were born with and it wasn't a natural seed it's right here the carnality of our mind paul said the carnal mind is enmity to god in other words the carnal mind is what keeps us from being what we're supposed to be wow you say well no it's this that that's all it is it's the carnal mind that said enmity with god because what's the first thing something happens we start thinking instead of believing amen start trying to work something out but now watch what god did god said unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow thy conception he didn't kill her in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband so he's setting up the order because adam and eve are going to have some more kids they're going to have seth and they're going to have all those different different kids but he's directing eve now the desire is to your husband and he shall rule over thee and he said unto adam because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hath eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt scroll it on up so i can read it please and thou shalt eat the herb of the field and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was not taken for dust thou art unto dust thou shall return and adam called his wife's name e because she was the mother of all living remember adam was not the father of all living the seed that was inside of her one of them was from the beast that now was totally eradicated he had no more line there's no more seed line of that beast because what the beast seed that you and i have to worry about now is the carnality of our mind not that somebody was born from an animal um sorry and adam called his wife's name e because she was the mother of all living until adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins those little fig leaves they made wasn't good enough and the lord god made coats of skin and clothing the lord god said behold the man has become one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand to take also the tree of life and need and live forever so god had to what create the division he said this is basically what he's telling him he said look you go out there and fend for yourself i'll be with you oh listen adam lived 900 something years you know he didn't kill him but he died before that thousand years was over because he started deteriorating and man you know we got 70 years 80 years and some 90 years we're we're we're pushing it but but 900 years that's a long time you see how strong god made that first man and woman though and even the next generation down through there methuselah noah they were six seven eight nine hundred years old but god cursed the ground so now what they're taking from the ground is what's killing us but what do we eat know now if we're eating on the body word of the son of man it doesn't matter what this guy's going to do it's that inside man is what's feeding off the word of god therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground for whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed it to east the garden of eden cherubim the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life in other words it blocked adam from getting back in to partake of what jesus christ the tree but that same tree of life is what came on christmas morning in april and a little baby that by an immaculate conception amen has everybody got that same amen all right so just keep going here's the definition of enmity one of them typical mutual hatred or ill will we're going to see that in just a minute let's look at number eight oneness this is one of my favorite favorite favorite messages now notice this now the woman was not a seed therefore he said i will put enmity between thy seed and the serpent's seed telling her what he was going to do himself to give her a seed not through an intercourse sexually he was going to create in her a seed listen when you and i get born again that's the creative power of god satan can't create so he can't give you that he can give you eternal life but god can give you his eternal seed life by the baptism of the holy ghost satan can't do that and he hates it well you say would it be his seed yes it would belong to mary then after he give it to her this is my eye he give me this it's my eye but he give it to me this is my hand he give it to me this is my voice but he gave it to me see and the seed that was mary had nothing to do with mary it was something god did himself because he promised in genesis 3 15. so the seed that was in her then was a union of an unlawful act now somebody eve it's not talking about mary it's not about eve because he's talking about her own up here and he kind of makes this little analogy and then he gets back to eve so the seed that was in her then was a union of an unlawful act which was death she was already pregnanted with the serpent seed because she had lived with us she turned and said herself the serpent beguiled me that's right and immediately came come on oh we know she said she got a child from god certainly every child that's born illegitimate or anything else has to come by an act of god he's the one who can make life certainly that is see she has already she was all ready to be mother and that never only what it did was clear up the thing of the serpent seed the seed that's in you now is by concepted your unlawful act against my word what she went with the beast to a natural seed right and you got the serpent seed but i'll give you a seed by immaculate conception and his seed shall bruise the serpent's head and his head shall bruise the heel amen just let god have it if it's his word he'll bring it to pass amen that's what mary said you said isaiah 9 6 i just believe what you said genesis 4 verse 1. now here's the two we'll get to the twins right here we'll read this and then we'll then we'll close and adam knew eva's wife and she conceived and bear cane and said i have gotten a man from the lord now you know this conception right here was not with adam adam knew his wife eve we know that there's that little colon and she conceived and bear cain and said i've gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel that was from adam we know that and abel was the keeper of the sheep but came with the tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering them to the lord and abel he also brought the firstling of his flock and of the father of the lord had respect and to abel and to his offering but in decaying into his offering he had not respect why he cursed the ground it wasn't it was blood and cain was very roth and his countenance failed now where'd that come from that came from that beast side that didn't come from god that come from the b side that he that was that was there with with the beast and the lord said in the came why aren't thou wroth and why is thy countenance falling now here is where most people i say a lot of message people they say cain didn't have a chance he's just serpenty i just go back read the bible i really don't care what they say same way with daniel 70 weeks and all that other stuff i really don't care what people say what does the bible say about it if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted there was his out there was the grace of almighty god telling him personally not through a prophet not to a priest not to a preacher he talked right to cain and said cain if you'll do well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door he give him a choice and to thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and cain talked with abel his brother now why did cain kill abel cain didn't kill abel because he didn't like him as far as a person it was two different opposing doctrines hello it was the opposing doctrines is what killed abel cain says why didn't he just walked away from god and like brother brown said one time cain said here here's my sacrifice take it or leave it see that's the way the devil would be but he talked with abel and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him that murdering just like cain and abel we're going to type it a little bit later on but they came to nicea cain and abel a true word of god true servants of god with the true word of god with the true way to sacrifice with the true way of the word of god and then here sets cain cain said no we're not doing your way anymore we're doing it our way take it or leave it that's exactly what cain did he was sitting there at that table and i seeing that cane spirit and said this is the way it's going to be and i'm going to kill you if you don't agree with me because right after that what issued in the dark ages where millions of christians were killed because they didn't agree with cain's doctrine there at nasa let's bring it up a little bit closer we'll close right here let's bring it up to today oh no they don't want to slit your throat now maybe someone might want to if they can get by with it when you set ministers meetings and all the different meetings and things and you see people that literally just get veins popping out of their neck you know because you don't agree with their doctrine what kind of spirit is that the spirit of god spirit king the antichrist spirit that works in the children of disobedience they're disobedient to the word of god amen so that's in the framework of this church message church that we're talking about now that's why i say i wanted these two seeds look how they came down but look where they went to they went to a religious gathering at nicaea they didn't go to some party they didn't bring cain's group from a party no it was the church the church of the day the one that constantine said well now we'll just change everything over and and we'll just give all the power to the church and we'll build these beautiful buildings and we'll go on crusades but every bit of that was the devil because what did those crusades do they walked into a community and they said if you don't believe the way we believe we're going to kill you and they martyred them by the millions 68 million christians were killed 68 million abels were killed because they didn't take cain's doctrine don't tell me that's not alive today and today if you don't preach what people want you to preach you won't preach in their church anymore same thing happens today let's read this right here real quick and then we'll close i know it's 12 o'clock but you can go home when i get done okay and please take a nap well no you won't need to you've been napping since 10 30. sorry notice the exact way the record of god sets forth the account of the births of cain abel and seth this is from the church age book genesis 4 1. and adam knew eva's wife and she conceived and bear cane and said i've gotten a man from the lord and she again bear his brother abel genesis 4 25 and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth there are three sons born from two acts of carnal knowledge by adam since the bible is the exact and perfect word of god this is no mistake but a record for our illumination since three sons were born from two acts by adam which is what abel and seth since three sons were born from two acts by adam you know positively that one of those three was not the son of adam see how the bible is perfect god has recorded this in this exact manner to show us something the truth of the matter is that eve had in her womb two sons twins from separate impregnations she was carrying twins with cain's conception sometimes previous to that of abel's see those twins again perfect type as always let's go to the next one hearing recognizing and acting 1960. whenever there is a revival it always produces twins that's a rude remark but it's true when there is a birth out of from isaac and rebecca it produced twins when the world was created you get this when the world was created it produced twins not cain and abel two trees tree of knowledge of good and evil and a tree of life when the world was created two things came in what satan or lucifer and god then you go to cain and abel and when cain and abel were born it produced twins when ishmael and isaac were born it produced two when esau and jacob was born it produced two one of them natural one of them the earth the other one supernatural and one looked at the natural intellectual the other one walked by the spirit it's always been that way one more and then musicians come power transformation there is always twins listen sitting here today is twins when you go home there's going to be twins your twin that's born by supernatural birth and you're the twin that's born by natural birth everybody got that that's why the brother brown said we were born between satan and eve there's always twins and that's the reason don't forget this little flock the church in the last days is going to be twins so close that he'll deceive the elected matthew 24 24. see the church is going to it's a pentecostal move now not pentecostal i'm talking about pentecostal move it is so much like the real thing until it would deceive the very elect if possible and a little later on if i get the chance i won't explain what how that election comes see it's going to deceive them because it's almost like the same thing see just two fathers same mother two fathers that's all same mother same church same movement same thing the bedding ground is the same where the word falls but one of them like here is perverted you understand say amen if you do see one of them is a perversion because it's the wrong father which i will prove someday if god will let me that denomination is the mark of the beast i'm just reading see it's the wrong father he is stirring people to an organization instead of the word see it's the wrong father look what it's a cane movement wow it's a cane moon i'm talking about here this day right here right now there are people good pentecostal people there's good baptist people there's good methodist people that's good but there's going to be a lot of good people in hell if they're in the wrong brother brown said being in the wrong ranks at the time of the rapture is no excuse musicians come there's no excuse it being in the wrong ranks of this time place today word god moving showing us that he's here but beware the other guy's here too and he's going to try to get you just one word off beautiful sermons but just one word off folks the twins didn't die with cain and abel the spirits are still here they still walk with you every day they talk with you every day listen if you're not born again that's the only spirit that works on you every day until god gets ready and you listen to what he has to say let's stand our feet god bless you but folks our deception is not out there though if you think a father son holy ghost baptism is right your satan's already got you the fight is is that you and i the fight that we're having is the same fight that cain and abel had in the garden of eden over doctrine doctrine doctrines kill you brother brown said you kill a man's influence you kill the man you don't have to literally kill somebody just kill their influence amen thank god we got a wonderful pastor that a lot of people don't like my dad because it's a doctrine it's not because of it's not because him being a person he's the best guy known in the world but because of his doctrine that he stood for which i stand for and we stand for is not according to a lot of the other movements that are going around the message and you know what i that's okay because there's only going to be a little small amount of people going to really go to the body change really small amount so but we can do it we can do it we've been pressurized for it we've been warned of it we've been told it's coming we've been told now that it's here that the two spirits are working in the framework of this message church look at them now they're trying to even the people in the message are they're leaving that's a cane movement that's a cane movement i think god's not moving people away from the message of the hour lord he's i thought he was driving and supposed to be driving us to it i thought he was supposed to be you know we love revelation and all that but we get revelation in our due season eve thought she got revelation but she went out there to get it we're just walking right there with god what brother brown said he said you can't jump from here to here he said you'll fall he said just let god work these things out all the way that's why god's given us all this time in our life i mean a lot of you probably didn't we didn't think that well naturally when i was 16 years old in 1976 i didn't think i was going to be 17 years old because you know brother brown was said to you know what he said which they took wrong people took wrong because he wasn't wrong when he said what he said about 1977 but we just didn't think it was gonna i mean we weren't even gonna graduate school must let's be standing here with grandkids right so so but you know what that was our carnality it was nothing god told us if god told us it was gonna be 1977 and that's the way it would be anybody understand that but god now i believe is telling us he's giving us the pieces of the puzzle now and fitting them together for all of us to see don't let it pass us by don't be like cain and say i believe this take it or leave it well you know what you will probably get left because god moves on you will probably get left all right so god bless you let's sing a song if anybody has a need continue to pray for brother dale i'm staying with him tonight so uh we will have some you know good information to give everybody tomorrow morning and uh most some of us are off tomorrow so i'm off tomorrow so we'll get to beaver brother dale and uh he told me yesterday afternoon he said just continue on with what you're doing i said you worry about getting better it will be all right you worry about getting better all right you keep eating and and i'm sure he's watching you know i know he's watching them today so just pray for him pray for mom too that we'll all have strength to be able uh this this is not something that uh um nobody likes to be sick but you know what if if we're god's children this is exactly what he where he wants us at he wants us to depend on him abraham had to come to a place at 90 and 9 that he said i can't do this no more god you're going to have to come on the scene and do it maybe we've come to a place now and say god we can't fight this thing anymore we've been fighting it and fighting and fighting and fighting talking about all this disease and stuff god we're just going to depend on you we're going to depend on you let the holy spirit lead us and let him guide us into what to do and not be don't be like a cane don't refuse god don't refuse it if you refuse it you get exactly what cain gets amen you get driven out from the presence of the lord and we don't want that so let's go let's sing a song [Music] um [Music] father she's been given a nature to take care of people lord now i pray that you'll turn around and take care of her father and that you'll take this away from her lord before she gets home lord that she'll realize that you've already went to calvary and by your stripes she's already healed father and that that healing power and that anointing will touch our sister lord so she can do her job father we pray these things in jesus name amen amen then he that is [Music] seeking whom he may devour the bible tells me so many souls have been his prey to walk in some week [Music] oh greater is he that is in me greater is he that is [Music] money not for me but something also had happened uh last year before my sister went back to kenya and i never gave that testimony so i felt well maybe i need to start testifying it might encourage anybody somebody but it's not for me um i'll start with yesterday yesterday at home you know just a usual saturday you may sit down if you want to just a usual saturday and you know normally it was raining i had plan i had planned to plant my college but it rained so much i said i'll do that another time so i kept uh i stayed upstairs you know doing my work and taking care of the kids but and but anderson i don't know out of nowhere he decided we had bought some racks these huge rocks probably three months ago and they were sitting in the carport and the plan was we took out all of our because i we have a lot of clothes david's clothes sarah's clothes that we were trying to see if we can give out or take them to goodwill so i just put them out in the carport because the cup would have a lot of room but anderson said well if if you think you want to give them out let's buy these racks and i'll set it set them up in the attic and then we can put them up there but i took too long to get to work on that because i thought i'll ask a few people who need some children's clothes before i put them up there but those rocks they've been sitting in the carport almost three four months and out of nowhere he decided he'll walk on them on the rocks and i'm sorry i keep getting so emotional i don't know why anyway he decided he'll walk on the rocks and just put him in the basement just he thought he'd do one and then he said two and then he said all of them three of them and then and he normally has a class on saturdays from one to four i think he kept it running while he was just fixing them fixing up the racks so he did that and then he took everything that was on the floor and put it on the rocks we woke up in the morning the basement is flooded flooded i've never seen i i never knew what flooding is i remember the brother here brother forbu she said his basement flooded but i've never i've never witnessed what a flooding a basement is so we woke up i saw uh he woke up a little earlier than me at five and i didn't know david we had a rough night with david staying up i was staying up with him um so the basement was flooded and he had put everything up on the rugs yesterday not knowing and you know he's so busy and i don't know what made him do that just put everything up other than one box and the one box was i think for trash oh what he had gathered is trash just left the only thing that got damaged is a mattress that we had it on a wall that was the only thing that was not on a so we woke up man i didn't know what flooding is and it had zipped in the carpet is wet the boards are wet so you know we call the landlord and we have to go to laws that buy the that vac thing that sucks the water out but i i wondered all that time they've been sitting there and then all of a sudden yesterday he felt he needs just to do that i thought that was something anyway now last year i had this we witnessed something and i should have testified so when this happened today i said i have to go testify now last year before you all know that mary went back to kenya and before she went and it's you know living on the uh she she was to be very comfortable back home as a veteran getting all her monthly check and it would go way better back home but mary's had she's been struggling a lot and hi and my brother and my mother last year around june may june they went to texas and we didn't know she's been i think she either took her medication wrong her pst you know postpartum you know the post-war thing depress those medications she took them wrong that's what she said and it made her act so wacky abnormal on that trip in a way that when they came back from texas she took her purse with her car keys and everything threw it over the window and they were almost like two hours into georgia they had a very hard time with her trying to contain her because she just wanted to hit the windows everything but they made it through her and my mother and my brother but they told me you know what we somewhere after we crossed the georgia alabama line she too opened the window to cuppas and just threw it and it's dark we don't know where it landed the car keys everything house keys they're all in the past i said oh my goodness now what do we do so the next day i decided i'll look up because i asked my brother how far are you about two hours so i said i'll call the villa rica police station you know coming up douglasville is there any purse that has been reported missing you know found on the road no purse no purse and i thought well let me call her ben because her bank card is in there her army cards are in there let me call the bank the bank couldn't help me because she has to be the one to call now by the time they got home rebecca who is an lpn decided to call the police and take her to the hospital because she was fighting the police had to come and take her to the hospital to cut to wellster in in australia because my my sister lives in douglasville so she couldn't uh we couldn't deal uh talk to her about her purse or anything what do we do what do we do with the bank she could she was not there to do that so i just told my brother you know i'll forget about the purse and the bank now the per um i mean i forget about the bank issues and the credit cards and everything i wouldn't worry about that now the car keys and the purse it has everything of her you know her life her documents i told my mom well i've called the police stations there's no past reported what i'll do i told mom now i don't know what else to do but this is what i'll do mom and i told her over the phone i will pray that god will bring the person to her apartment to her door and i said you know i'll just pray that and forget about it and that's i remember one morning or the following morning i woke up it was around 5am i just knelt down i prayed god we don't know what to do but you take that purse to the doorstep her apartment complex right to the door because anybody anybody would have picked it up you know some picked it up that you know or fell in a ditch somewhere tell you what so she went to the hospital stayed three days came back home i don't even know how they got into the apartment she lives in a gated gated complex so i think the the guy at the uh front desk opened the door i don't know how they got it but anyway three days later she gets a call from the gate because you cannot just come in you have to get to the gate she says uh there's somebody here an old couple here and they want to see you she said oh okay what is it about and they need to go because they're driving to florida and they have your purse here i said oh my god she said oh really okay let me come down so she went down i think when she got there they were gone it was a couple from kansas they were driving to florida and i think i don't know how they were on 75 they took a pass took the driver's license in the in the wallet drove to that address dropped there and went on so i told my mom now you see what you remember three days ago i told you how pretty it be taken to her doorstep and why not for that you know security guard at the at the complex they probably would have walked right to the doorstep so and you pray for my mother because what came to my mind at that time is my mother is she she knows the message but she's backslidden and i told my husband probably this was for my mother to say and if you can pray for her just pray for us oh but that testimony really shook me and i said you know i need to trust god in everything and praying just trust god and not worry about you don't have to work anything out and just pray and let it go but that really touched me simple faith that's all it takes just simple faith that purse think of the odds of throwing it out in a major interstate and slinging it god knows where well he did but then have enough to work on the other end did you notice it was an older couple more seasoned knew the importance of the purse maybe an 18 year old picked it up and they run through it and throw it back over the river or something but an older couple that was traveling god just spoke to him and said there's a purse right there one of my kids dropped her purse out out the window how about picking it up and taking it to the house for amen let's stand our feet that's god folks that's god that's simple childlike faith that's a restorative that's eve coming back to where she's supposed to be all of us being the spiritual eve bride of jesus christ amen let's bow our heads daily father thank you for this day that you give us we pray that you would anoint us now for this
