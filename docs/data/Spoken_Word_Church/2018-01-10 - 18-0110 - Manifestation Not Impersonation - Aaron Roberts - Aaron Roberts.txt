59-1220E  IDENTIFIED.WITH.CHRIST_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-4 N-4  SUNDAY_
«  68       †        Now, if people of this day with that great desire and great ambitions to be like somebody for an example, if they took Christ as their Example, then we would have--we could fire every police there was in the nation. Everybody would be meek and humble; everybody would be kind and have brotherly love one for the other; there would never be a divorce case ever pled in our country. There would never be any sickness; we could even dismiss hospitals, if everybody tried to make Jesus Christ their Example. We wouldn't have need for nothing else.
    So that nature is in the man, but he puts it on the wrong thing. He makes some man... And you know the Bible said that we are cursed when we make flesh our stay? When you try to make flesh your stay or put your trust in flesh, the Bible said you are cursed. How well I know; it's so easy to do it.


59-1220E  IDENTIFIED.WITH.CHRIST_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-4 N-4  SUNDAY_
«  73       †        But, oh, I'll be thankful all through eternity to one day I read about Jesus. That satisfied me. I want to be like Him. That's my desire, to be able to turn the other cheek or go the second mile, to be able to forgive when the odds is all against you, hold nothing against anybody, though they're mistreating you rightfully--or wrongfully for your right doing, but still love them. That's the way I want to be. I want to be that kind of a person. I want to be able that when I'm railed upon I would rail not back. That's the kind of a Example that God gave us in Jesus Christ. We ought to be identified with Him. We are...
    "How do you become identified with Him?" You'd say, "Brother Branham, now, to get... You have to dress like the Hollywood stars and do these other things." But how do you become identified with Jesus Christ? First, you repent of what you already have done. And then, you're identified with Him here in the pool. No doubt but what many will b...

praying and you start trying to you know find the mind of the Lord trying to find something to say don't just get up here but don't you see seems like you just get I just can't get any sleep you just get tired or and tired or so I feel like I I could lay down sleep right now so you man y'all just pray for me to not and you know they say you know I guess the devil's trying to work on this so the Lord must have something for us so we're just gonna look into the scripture to not hoping to be a blessing to you we're gonna first we're gonna go to Romans chapter 6 and then we're gonna and then we just got one verse in Galatians so we'll speak tonight on manifestation not impersonation and you know it's in the hour in which we live it's it's quite interesting that you know we have a lot of people that they like to use the word identify I identify with this identify with that the problem is when they say identify you know they're not in any way connected to that and you know you know after the world you know we've had people that you know belong to different want to be different races and you know different groups and all kinds of stuff you know that they say hey I want to be you know I in a file with this well you know brother Brennan preached a message called impersonation of Christianity and you know people want to identify with something but what is the standard that you have to meet right to be that and there's only one foundation that God ever give us to build on there's that one standard that's the word right and so now you know we're kind of where I want to go tonight but I don't know how long I'm gonna speak tonight but I just it's just what Lord laid on my heart and I just want to share this with you and hope it'll be a blessing so let's before we get started let's just pray and then we'll get right into the scripture our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you and we just thank you for all that you've done for us and we just pray tonight you just come and speak through lips of clay Lord tonight and just be with us in a special way and father for each need that's represented in this building tonight lord I just pray that you'll be with them and minister in a special way for all that are a Sikh and whatever that whatever the needs are Lord you know it and we know that you I have already made a way and already made it and it's already been finished before the foundation of the world and Lord we're just so thankful that that father we just pray that you just come and help us tonight and bless each one that's here bless the bride around the world Lord for the ones that are working and laboring and your vineyard we just pray that you continue to bless them give them strength and Lord we just pray just commit all things to you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen Romans chapter 6 is very familiar baptismal scripture says what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live longer how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us that were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we also should walk in the newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin for if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead death no more death have no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but live unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord amen and the next scripture will reach just one scripture here in Galatians two it says I am crucified with Christ and that's what struck me people want to identify with something but Paul says I am crucified I don't run just to identify with Christ he said I'm crucified I went the same path that that that Jesus took I've been the same way nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me because there's been a conversion right so when the old man is dead he said I'm still living in the same flesh but the life I live is not the old man right and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me amen god bless you tonight you may be seated I didn't think I was the waterworks let's start praise the Lord amen we're like thank the Lord for the reading of the word thank you for there's the scripture here and that we read in Romans 6 and in verse 3 it says know you not that so many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death now when you when you and I didn't go back and pull up the the Greek and all of that but when you go back and look at what this what the verses mean when he's speaking of baptism the baptizing is not just being immersed in water but it also speaks of the unity and the fellowship that you have with Jesus Christ has been coming into something and I think I can't remember who was my brother Wade or somebody was was talking about using the word baptism and the word baptism was speaking of the illustration that was given was about pickles about taking cucumbers you know you bul the you put them in bowl and put the cucumber into boiling water and that's just an outward that's the first stage I was they said that you know it's temporary but the second stage is going into the vinegar solution which actually produces the change so it's not just doing the outward works but it's actually going through the process and having a change take place and so he talks about the unity that not never because it you know I believe that the commission that was given was repent and be baptized so I believe that is a necessary element of it is to be baptized is to be immersed in water but that's not the end of it because if we repent and we are baptized and we believe then God's obligated to do his part which is to give us the Holy Ghost so he says that we are to be so we are to follow him and go through the steps that he ordered for us to do and then in Galatians 2 when it says I am crucified with Christ so that shows that he says through Christ's death on the cross that he was crucified it says the way they were said it has utterly destroyed our former self it's not just separated but it's actually destroyed and then it says completely separated from the corruption of the old creature so all of that has been destroyed and been totally separated and annihilated and moved away so that we no longer live in the old way because it's Paul said the life I live is not me but it's Christ and so you know we I mean people that want to not just you know identify with something but it's to be crucified it's to die up to ourselves and and you you look at in the scripture and and you the word identify is not in the in the scripture but taking the fault and you look up the word identified because you know people today they say we only be identified with something and brother Branham preached a message identified with Christ and you know you take that zone what what does it mean to be identified or identify what is it what's the word meaning and there's two different ways of looking at the word identify the first one means to establish who or what something is so you clearly make something known they says to make clear or show plainly so that's to identify and so another way of looking at that is to manifest what that is to identify that is to make manifesto to reveal something so that is how it is and as he will say use me as Paul was saying that's not me anymore but it's Christ that liveth so it's Christ being made manifest I'm revealing Christ Christ has become real in my life so that's what comes out it's not that I have to try to do something to make him visible it becomes visible because of the life that's in there and the second one that we look at is another version of the word identify is to associate with to associate closely to relate with to side with but no matter how close you try to relate some thinner or try to be close to or side with you can never be what that is people you know I side with this you know but that is you know is really the other definition for the word is impersonate because no matter how close you get you're still just an impersonation of that you because it's not real you know even if you take something that's a replica it can be a masterpiece as far as a replica of a statue or a sculpture or a painting but it's still it's still I mean there still it's not real it still has the part of being counterfeit because no matter how much you try to make of it it's still not the exact same thing so it's it's not what it is so we can't we can have a part of something but it's not real and you know we can we can identify things by you know sight and sound and one of the things I was thinking about when I was what I was looking at this was though about brother Gary Adkinson you know brother Gary I think was one of the top people in the world make people laugh and impersonate people you know he could start talking about like somebody and you'd think it was them you know hick it they could get that really down really close but you know that didn't identify I mean it you could tell who he was what he was trying to impersonate but that wasn't the person but you know you can try to do so much but if you but if it's not real you can try to live the life of a Christian but but that's not real brother Brown said just be who you are we're not we're not trying to try to do you know I'm trying to make something happen we just need to be and let him live this is from the from the message identified with Christ 1959 he said would just seem to see there's no satisfaction among the people what do they what makes them do it it's for a cause it's a nature God gave them that nature they've got a nature that makes them want to have something to identify themselves with they must have something that they want to be like an object objective in life they want to be a movie star a cowboy or something on that idea he said I was hearing on the radio coming home where some great Italian men at Denver was trying to play Hopalong Krass that he's something with a loaded gun instead of that he's going to be a Chester the rest of his life he shot his kneecap off there you are and some people probably don't know who Chester is I was like we'll find out who people who the older folks are people ever watch Gunsmoke but it says but they are trying to find something to identify themselves with and the reason they are doing it is because there's something in them that God made them that but God made them an exam God made them an example to be identified with and that was when he made Jesus Christ become I become your Savior that's the example that's what people want should want to be identified with Jesus to be like him and they continue continues on and he's talking about the kids wanting to be like different ones and he says you know the the kids wanting to be different ones but he said the example was Jesus Christ he said God gave us an example to be like but we refuse to be it now that's what the matter with the world they got the desire God has given that but they've turned it the wrong way it's time to return back and get on the right Road and get facing Calvary nature proves you know though and you know the world is full of of people that as brother brother dick was just saying it just a min ago you know the world is full and I didn't I didn't bring the pictures but if you if you have the desire to see it I'll show you them I'll show you the pictures but these are some of the people that live in the world and I'm gonna tell you about a few and you know and some moment some of them were pretty familiar with because we've heard all about it and you know I mean we've got an even brother Bentham I've got a quote in here where you know he talks about the world being full of perversion he says the girls want to be like look you know trying to be boys and the boys are trying to be like girls and and all of that and I said well you know what because we see that that's a big part of the world we've got a bunch of people that are trying to be like one person and and somebody else is trying to be like somebody else and you know men trying to be like women and women trying to be like me and and we've got white people identifying with black people and you know I don't know if y'all heard about the the college professor who called african-american studies and identified with as a black person was even hired as a black person and worked in again a verse city and both her parents are as white as I am but she identified and they hired her as a black woman because she identified as being black and their and and so we have those kind of people know that the ones that the ones that I think are most astonishing I guess is the best word to say is the people who think they're animals now I didn't bring the pictures but if you want to see them I'll show them - we can pull them up but there are people online who live as dogs they live in these leather suits and they had a picture of a man who looks like a Great Dane and he's sitting on the couch with his master owner he eats out of out of a bowl he does everything like a dog there is oh there is a woman in Norway and you look it up there's a woman in Norway who believes she's a cat she believes she can see better at night she hates water she hates dogs but everything that you associate with a cat that's her life she said at the age of 16 she realized that she was a cat and you know these people will tell you that you don't get no matter what you say that is their reality then and they don't care what you say to them that is what is real to them now what's so funny is we got a lot of people in the world today and you ask them how they're doing you know and in the urban in the urban language in the slang because we as we say you people you ask people how they do it say I'm keeping it real I'm keeping it real well you know what it ain't keepin it real it's keeping it true it's the truth no one because we can lock in our own reality but is it the truth Jonah's reality was laying in the belly of the whale wrapped in seaweed but the truth was he was on the journey where God he was in the right place where God wanted him that he was on the way to deliver Nineveh but that's what but his reality was down learning as brother Brent said in the vomit and all the other things that he was down and he thought he was so miserable that was his reality the Hebrew children their reality was in a flame of fire that was so hard that the men that tried to put them in died that was the reality that they were in the truth was they were right there where God wanted them to be and they were in them in the hands of God that their because they were so they were so in tune with God and standing on his word that he become visible to them in the flames you know because sometimes what is our reality but the truth is sometimes we don't realize that we're right in the hands of God you know you know we're weird we're in better hands than Allstate as this you know we're you know good hands that also you know I'd rather be in God's hands see that is the reality we can have a you know we can have a reality what we think is real what we see but because we live in a world of senses but are we in the truth jesus said i am the way the truth and the life a philippians tells us that paul said he said whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are just you know all the different whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are a good report he said he said if there be any virtue of there be any praise and think Oh these things not thinking a reality but you know we have so many people that you know they want to live in a you know they've got their own way of living now the another craziest one I'm going to tell you about some of the way that some of these people live in the world there was a man who went through the process to become a woman and now he's in the process or she whatever whichever pronoun you think but this person is now trying to become a dragon it's it's tattooed from head to toe has had their ears surgically removed and has horns and has died the the eye white of this person's eyes are now green and that you can't convince them otherwise that's what they are they live in that reality there was a there was a woman who went through all of the procedures surgeries everything you can think of to become a woman and she will tell you that if you think she's still a man even though she said well after I've spent all this time surgery everything I've done to become this and you tell me that I'm not said you're the one that's crazy you're the one that has a problem but you know what no matter what you do you can never ever ever change the DNA that DNA will always stay the same no matter what and it's just like and and a few other few other ones and some of the oddball ones we've had a few other people we had a man that tried to beat you no claim to be a surgeon done surgeries good actually operated impersonated a surgeon then three surgeries and the and the doctors were actually amazed at this man's medical technique he completed three surgeries and they were amazed but they finally arrested him for impersonating and practicing without a license it doesn't care what how much this man could do he still wasn't a doctor we have people that walk up and down the streets you find different people they employ impersonate police officers they impersonate soldiers and all kinds of other things they live in a reality that's not yours but it's real to them I worked with a guy years ago he was telling me a story he said he got drunk he was trying to make it home going down the hall he was going down the sidewalk he said I got to a certain point and he said then the sidewalk disappeared he said I was staying there trying to figure out well the decided what he said cause it was there and then it what and he stood there trying to figure out where the sidewalk was you couldn't convince him the sidewalk guess it did disappear he had to have some help from some folks to get him home and they did get him home but you know what that was his reality but what's what's the craziest thing is now what we talk about all these people that are you know mind-boggling but what's what's crazier than that to me is the people that claim to be a Christian we have we have a world full of people that claim to be Christians and and it's like well what what is it what is to mean to be a Christian what is it what is it how do we identify a Christian well I just say so I hung up a cross just like people you know how do you how do you claim you know identify message believer well I got my equal belt buckle how is it how is it that we identify these things because people people want to talk about you know I I want to be I'm identified with Christ I'm a Christian but what does it mean to be a Christian we go back to the message identify with Christ brother Bram says now if people of this day with that great desire and great ambitions to be like somebody for an example he said if they took Christ as their example he said then we could fire every police there was in the nation everybody would be meek and humble everybody would be kind and have brotherly love one for the other there would never be a divorce case ever played in our country there would never be any sickness we could even dismiss hospitals if everybody tried to make Jesus Christ their example he said we wouldn't have need for nothing else and then dropped down he says but oh I'll be thankful all through eternity too one day I read about Jesus that satisfied me I want to be like him that's my desire to be able to turn the other cheek or to go the second mile to be able to forgive when the odds is all against you hold nothing against anybody though they're mistreating you rightfully or wrongfully for your right doing but still love them that's the way I want to be I tell you what some sometimes things happen and you read something like that anything or that you know that's hard yeah you know I think about David's sometimes when you know when David respected the anointing that was on soul and God puts all and David's hands and even though Saul had turned his back on God and he said but I wouldn't I would dare touch God's anointed and the three times that David was David had the opportunity to kill Saul even though you look at how many times it's all try to kill David and then he turned around and even David's own men told him Sid said look God has put him in your hand and he went down there he took his sword and it said he cut off part of Saul's skirt and then he left and you know the scripture tells us that that it even it even bothered David enough that just because he cut off Saul's skirt that is that he destroyed his garment and then even called out to him and told him said listen you know God I could have killed you God made this way that I could have killed you but I did and he held up that part of that skirt and said look I could have killed you and I didn't he showed the integrity that David had in his heart he says that's the way I want to be I want to be that kind of a person I want to be able that when I'm real de pon i would not rail back that's the kind of example that God gave us in Jesus Christ we ought to be identified with him said how do we become identified with him brother you'd say brother branham now you have to dress like Hollywood stars and do these things but how do you become identified with Jesus Christ first you repent of what you already have done and then you're identified with him here in the pool no doubt what many will be identified with him in a few minutes and in the pool you are identified with him in baptism for if we baptize our baptized in Christ we are identified to his death burial and resurrection that's why we were baptized we go down in the water and come back up to witness that we believe in the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ and if we be planted in his likeness in his death God gave us a promise we'd be like him in the resurrection we want to be just just like him but it's not it's not to be impersonation of him but we wanted to have the same life that he has we want him living in us you know many people they they talk about wanting to live and it's like well how do you come up how do you identify yourself with Christ how do you identify yourself and you know many people that they they want to look and the reality is is the truth is rather is they live in the reality of Jesus it's their reality yeah some people get up and they say well Jesus was a social reformer he come to change the world he said he said I didn't he said this is not my kingdom he said he said if this was mocking if we come to fight flesh he said my people would rise up and fight but we didn't he said he said the Son of man didn't come to do anything but to seek and save those were lost that's all his goal was but many people want to identify Jesus they want to make him a certain pedestal many people they say Jesus was all loving Jesus Jesus was a good God he was he was loving and he was compassionate but do you know what compassionate means see two big compassion that doesn't mean that you just hand everything over to somebody there was a there was a man that was in in Vietnam in the in the war and he said we got all these excuse me you know you have these young men usually go to college or sometimes they go through what they call OCS Officer Candidate School they become an officer they get their little gold bar put them on their shoulders you know and then they say hey do you know this man you know he's still wet behind the ears but he's gonna lead this group well you know what they do they sent him over there and the first thing they do is they find some hard crusty sergeant and he goes out this man who knows what he's doing and he put this young man with him and until he actually gets to the place where they think he they can turn him over and actually lead a group had to stay with the sergeant they knew what was going on but you know he was telling about they had all these people and and they come over there and he said they want to they wanted to be their friend they wanted to be their buddies and and you know he said he said a lot of these officers that were young men that got to this place he said they were killing them with kindness he said he said that wasn't that didn't help them any he said the ones that were actually helped them were the ones that actually made him follow the rules he said you know he said the one thing he hated was a few walking long distances and going through all these things this he said the one thing you took care of was your feet that's the way you got around and he said he said he said they had to go change their socks and wash their feet and take care of their boots and all these type things he said was sometimes a lot of them was after they went through a hard day and threw about or whatever the lieutenant would just say we just lay down but he said he said the ones that actually cared about the people about his men it's the first thing done when they sat down is change your socks have you checked your feet what's going on and do you have any leeches on them are you taking care of these things see being compassionate is not just enabling somebody to do something but actually holding them to the standard that is being compassionate and people say with Jesus was compassionate yes he was but he still made them hold the standard people say today oh don't judge me don't judge me you don't have the right to judge me no but the word is our judge what are we standing well you know what are we as Christians we mean what are we looking at I mean is it just a reality are we actually staying with the word I mean do we actually hold this standard into people say well don't judge me you know you don't have a right and you know and I've heard I've heard this more than once people talk about Jesus they said well you know that woman that they found in adultery and they brought her to Jesus and they threw her down and they said the law says we must stone her and say you know Jesus didn't stone her but you know Jesus got down and he wrote in the sand and when she didn't have any more accusers he asked her said woman where are your accusers so Lord I don't have any their bone and it's like oh but jesus said when neither do i condemn thee that's what that's the part that people don't realize he said neither do i condemn thee well you know what Jesus didn't send her back out to be a prostitute he come up and said neither do i condemn thee but go and sin no more God Jesus didn't coming enable her just Oh we'll go ahead just do what you know I run off all your accusers go ahead and do it again no he was compassionate but he still held her to the word and he told her go and sin no more and so that's the way it is it's doing it do we hold ourselves or hold them to the word is there a standard brother branham was speaking one time he was talking about speaking to a and it was the Catholic Reporter and you know was talking about the different miracles that had taken place I believe was a the man that brother and opened the blind man's eyes and he was in Mexico or something or something along those lines but you know he was talking to the reporter and she was Catholic and you know and and she was talking about what do you believe our saints can do these things and all these different things and you know brother Branham says well you know it's the word he's oh well you can't you can't judge it by the word we judge it by the church well if you can't hold if you don't have a standard like where the Rebbe said if you don't have a standard then how do you come to a place to agree or even speak from because if you don't believe the word and I do then there's no place to start from and so you have to come to a place and then when you try to show people this is what the word says well nowadays we don't know you know well nowadays this will just get us a new Bible we've got a new translation whatever is that you don't like we just take it out of the Bible I think somebody here was talking about I don't remember who was some I think somebody with somebody you know they had that the book now called the Queen James by Bobbie if you don't know what that is yeah Sodom and Gomorrha and perversion is not in the scripture anymore they took it all out so if you if you want to live like that then it's okay because the Bible doesn't condemn it and then you have versions like the NIV where you start talking about where the scripture talks about Jesus came to seek and save those who are lost and different other scriptures that talk about salvation you can't even find them in the book it's like you go to the King James and you start reading and you go to the NIV it's not there it's like well we just we just find our own version of the Bible we get a new translation or whatever and we can we can live however what because this is our Bible well this is my reality just like just like they were talking about the the woman that got sick and her son had went to went to school and brother I'm telling the story about him going off to off to school to study and you know she got sick and they said the people from the mission down and the little preacher come down and read the scripture to and anointed her and prayed over and she got healed and then when her son came to find out what had happened to her because you know she was on her deathbed and he come home as like what took place my it's like well you know they took the scripture and they read it and and then they prayed over me March 16 and they read the scripture and they pray I know I did Mia prayed over me and you know what I got matter and he's like oh mama mama now hold on that's not even inspired I saw second him that's not even that's not even worth it we don't even read that you know that she got excited it's like well you know if the Lord can use it because that's not inspired well if he can do that with uninspired Word what can he do with the inspired Word what can he do with what was really inspired because we have to we have to find a resting place a place a standard because you know a lot of people you know is is Jesus because when we speak you know people people know about being a Christian well you know what does that what does that mean is are we looking at a Living God or are we looking at a historical figure you know I mean when we speak of Jesus and being identified with people talk about being identified with Christ I mean are we looking at you know we're using a Bible you know we're looking at the Bible or we're using a history book because you know today it's become big business and and you know to revise history and I think the quote was me many years ago was you know the victors always are the ones that write history and so they always write the history they want it to be but you know the Jews history that talks about in the Old Testament you know there's a lot of things that were said about a lot of those people in there that you know if they had been writing their history they would have never put it in there I mean that's a lot of things about Abraham's life you know Abraham didn't want it you probably wouldn't want anybody to know and there's a lot of people things that people haven't you know they didn't want anybody to know but you know in the end it shows the grace of God it shows the grace of God in our lives and their lives because he's the same yesterday today and forever and what he done for them he'll do for us today also know this is from the message letting off letting off the pressure 1963 brother Graham says that's the way of a Christian experience when people are trying to put a cold formal confession into a powerful Pentecostal church or experience unless that person is built up is built from ground up built up born again regenerated impersonators of today going around trying to impersonate speaking in tongues trying to impersonate this and personate that the gifts if they are not born again he said and if they are born again they cannot impersonate because they are built for these things they're born regenerated remoted not just something that's patched up and shook hands and got emotion and danced around the altar a few times it says I got it it's something that's been remoted and regenerated and become a new creature then it can stand the pressure of the persecution and the things that follows the spiritual life you've got to be made and built to stand the pressure and only one thing can do it and that's when you come into God's molding house and be torn down and rebuilt a new creature in Christ Jesus because and then it's given to the next quote is from doors and doors you scroll up there brothers and guess where he's talking about the rapture coming and - two in the bed one in the field and all and then brother Graham says you know he said what good does this he says so when we gather in these meetings let's gather we for one purpose that's to serve God let's put our lives to business what good does it do us to impersonate something why will we accept a substitute when the whole skies are full of genuine Pentecostal power and blessings why should we accept a substitute you won't exhaust God's blessings ask abundantly so see it it's there for us we have we have the whole the Pentecostal power is there all the blessings are there and it's part of being made made new and not accepting a substitute or trying to try to make something happen there like he said go into God's molding house and allow him to mold you you know the clay doesn't have to do anything when the potter does the molding the clay is just there and that's the way we have to be in our lives to be just like that and just let God do his work in our lives and say Lord I just want to lay here and let you do the work and not try to push her you know that's listen to brother Bentham the other day and he was doing he was calling people out in the prayer line and he called a sister out and he and she had a need and he says he told her said you know you're trying to work up something you're trying to press into this and he said you need to stop that he said that won't work because you know she's trying to work herself into something but he told you no brother man was trying to speak to her tell her listen you need to have faith to accept your healing God knows what your need is and he's here to meet but you can't force it in you can't force yourself into something because you've got to just let him do the work because that's not faith trying to work yourselves into something this is from the message Abraham and Paul said it's no more me but Christ that liveth in me and if Christ lives in a man if Christ lives his life like he did when he was here on earth for he said so Christ lives his life like he did when he was up here for he said so he said a little while and the world won't see me no more but you shall see me for I will be with you to the end of the world and the things that I do so shall you do and he's raised from the dead and he's here now in the same power that he had when he was here on earth doing the same thing saving the same kind of people killing the same kind of sick showing the same kinds of visions and skip down to the to the next quote dear brother this is from principles of divine healing and and brother branham's speaks about Jesus Christ is our high priest of our confession and he goes on talking about the angel meeting him at greens meal and he says he told me to go and I'd be praying for statesmen and great men and kings and monarchs and it would sleep around the world and now there's a revival sweep in the world originating in Jeffersonville Indiana Amen oh how wonderful he said now kings and rulers and great men they don't deal in fanaticism he said now I will admit the devil's got scarecrows along the road he's got people who tries to impersonate something he's got people Devils got people that impersonate a Christian try to make people believe they're Christians when they're not but that's that don't take away the value of a real Christian to my opinion it makes them conspicuous we know we've got to have the counterfeit you got to have you've got to have the impersonators but I like what brother Bram said it makes them it makes it take it doesn't take away the value of a real Christian because you know that's what the devil wants to do the devil wants to point people to look at this person and look at that person but he says to his opinion it makes a real value it makes a real true Christian stand out because you know there you know people say well I you know I don't want to go Church anymore because there's nothing but a bunch of hypocrites there you know all they see is the hypocrites and the hypocrites but you know you have to have those but if you're really looking if you're looking at the hypocrites then what are you comparing them to there has to be a real true one to compare it to or you wouldn't know those were hypocrites if you didn't know that then you know the hypocrites are Christians yeah because that was what you would identify them with you know it's just like people say well you know they don't want to be around any hypocrites I got to stay away from the hypocrites you know but don't go to the store don't don't go anywhere you know Pete you can't go nowhere because you know everywhere you go you're gonna run into hypocrites if you if you can't go to church with wooden Joe they're going to be here that's just that's just the way it is brother Branham says he saw about having impersonations and and everything and from the message second-hand Row brother brems says he said told about things matching up people wanting things to match up and he says tell about your neighbor doing to whatever you know you do something your neighbor does that you know you wear a black hat they will to get a new set of clothes and you know they do the same thing and it's impersonation they want a match he says brother I don't care if my trousers match my coat or my shirt matches my tie I want my experience to match God's Bible he says that's the kind of matching that the church ought to do it's exactly right my lord raised from the dead and he's alive tonight he's your Lord also and he's here to bless you and to help you and he said and so to make it one or the other because he was speaking of the Bible being truth or error he says you know if it's if it's error he said I don't want to have nothing to do with it he said so make it one or the other Godspeed the day when so-called Christians will leave the profess to be Christians or either say what they are to begin with I'd rather be an infidel than a hypocrite that's right be what you are if you'll believe Christ say yes and don't just oh I believe this and I believe this and either believe it all or none of it it's God either God's Word or it's not God's Word if God didn't write it then if part of its wrong then the other parts wrong that's right so it's either all or nothing it's all part of God or it's not so we need to be completely sold out or not and accept all of it and he said he was praying for the day that people would come and either say it's all wrong or it's all right and that's the day that we live in today because we have many people that have you know walked in the message for many years and and claimed it to be truth and all of a sudden now you know was it you know the first off you know it was things that brother Branham preached were was wrong and then it became things that brother Branham done we're wrong and then you know then it's the Bible's wrong you know there's nothing in the scriptures right so none of it's right but you know they still they still want to be identified with God it's like well you know how do we know who God is or how do we even contact God because they don't even have anything well God is just the good thoughts of your mind or whatever but Road Ram says this is a very familiar quote from birth pains and and I'll be finished up here in a minute but brother brems says you know we know the old CD is must before the new seat can come out of the old seat it must rot exact absolutely not die only but right after it's dead we know that to be true that's the same thing in new birth we can never go back and and and we but we go forward when you're born again he said that's why I think today we have so many not so many rather genuine new birth is because the seat is maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system the they were in they don't want to come out of it they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth or the message of the age you know a lot of people you can get a lot of people to sympathize with you you know some about you know people people want to have sympathy wit for you but you know the thing is you need to have compassion ya know sympathy empathy don't get anybody anywhere but compassion does compassion can change a situation and then the last quote is from the from the church age book you know brother Graham talks about needing that the accuracy of the word he said now don't let him would be being misled by what I have said and think that I do not believe in the accuracy of the word as we now have it I believe this word is accurate Jesus completely authenticated the Old Testament when here on earth and it was compiled exactly as was our New Testament make no state about it we have the infallible Word of God today and no man dares take from it or add to it but we have but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us he said oh how we need the need revelation by the spirit he said we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God when we have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his Spirit may God begin to give his spirit by his Spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested we would do the greater works and glorify God our Father in Heaven amen that's what God wants from us oh how we need a fresh revelation from God you know I was brother Benno's SID and I don't have with me and I'll have to paraphrase it but I can get the quote for you but you know brother Brennan talks about he said one of the problems we have is he said we don't get the Holy Spirit he said lots of times we get one another spirit he said he said lots of times churches get the pastor's spirit and he's talking about watching how pastors act and he said watch the congregation do the same thing but he was talking about having a a pastor that's a real teacher and he said he said the I have to paraphrase him but he said the power of Hell will never shake that church and you know what I think God we have the ministry that we do I don't I don't know if he if that's the same one but I can find a world around talks about that he said the real he said that if you have a real true pastor that's a teacher he said the powers of Hell can't shake that church amen so I think that I think the Lord for the ministry that we have here I think we're blessed god bless you now let's stand hope it's been a blessing to you I don't want to be you know an impersonation I don't want to I don't want to be a replica I don't want to be a copy you know lots of times we find preachers and and you you you you see preachers and when you start to hear him preach you know they you can tell that they you know they're just like this other preacher you know and I think years ago I think it was a and I may be wrong but but you know I think it was a there was a preacher one time and he tried to impersonate brother Carroll about the way brother Carroll took his glasses off or something you know you know it was the first thing but carol had a little talk with him about that you know you know there's only one one brother Carol you know you need to be who you are not because trying to being a preacher is not it's not trying to impersonate somebody it's not trying to it's to be who you are who God made you to be so it's not us trying to you know act like a certain person and you know carry our Bibles a certain way or do certain things know be who you are be genuine God wants us to be who we are because this we're made was it say we're fearfully and wonderfully made God made you you know God didn't God did if God made you a certain way than you know if God's living in you and he's made you to and he's given you these characteristics and he made you look a certain way you know some people you know they spend their a whole entire life you know wanting to be taller or thinner or all these different things you know they don't want to be this or that but you know what there's lots of people in this world that you know it's so funny you'll take somebody in and they'll say you know I like this person you know there's you know for instance I wish I wish I could learn Spanish I wish I was bilingual us one thing I like about brother Luis I wish I could be like brother Luis I wish I was bilingual I'm good to get just learning English I took three years of Spanish in high school and I told them I said I walked in a new taco burrito and enchilada I come out and I could say uno dos tres cuatro Cinco seis yet the Ocho Nueve Diez taco burrito enchilada though there's a lot of there's a lot of time and effort some people are blessed that way you know I went to high school with a boy and learning other languages was not a problem to him he just he took Spanish took French and they saying don't speak people and had no problem I have a hard time and you know somebody speaks to me in Spanish I have no idea if I sit and stare at something that's written in Spanish I had enough that I could if I can kind of decipher it but you know it's a long it's a long process but you know there's a lot of people you know people look at somebody and they say well I wish I could be like that person I wish I you know there's certain things and you know there's people that look at you they say the same thing it's like I don't know about that but you know what there's people that want it that look at you and you know there's characteristics and each one of us there's things about each one of us that we will not look at and think that God put them there for a reason you know and because some people some people are you know some people say boy you know I wish I wish I was you know I stand up for myself more and just be more outspoken and some people say you know I hate doing that because sometimes being outspoken sometimes you say things and sometimes people will say things and not really mean what they're saying because the way it's perceived is wrong it's not what they're saying is wrong this way it's perceived as wrong and some people and some people you know they they they're so well I wish I wouldn't look like that it's like wow you know I wish I was like a certain person because they hold their tongue and the other person saying boy I wish I was more like them and talk up Spock up but you know God made each one of us different to be who we are and that's what we ought to be and be and be thankful I mean I know you and you know we all get things in our lives that we don't want we all have personality and traits and different things and you know there's lot of things that God give us the to work on to make us who we are you know because those are the trials that we go through but some things are blessings and we don't and people don't even want to believe that so god bless you tonight [Music] [Music] you wanna see out make the labor truly you
