uh it's pretty easy it's pretty easy June you uh repent you accepted God right God called you you finally heard him after all these years of right of blocking it right we was deflecting it amen and uh repent be baptized and receive the gift amen hey that can't be too hard it was that's that's all I got to do since since uh August I was baptized and uh life was still in my way and I was struggling to make a church because I wanted to live the world life I still was trying to do things in my own power trying to fix my problems in life I came to the point where I can't miss church I don't care if it's 11-hour drive the rest of my family's here amen and I'm going to be with my family at church and I'm going to continue praying that my children and the rest of my family are here with me at

going to have a lot of tests but but uh like I said he's from the last time I saw him he's come along long way let's stand to our feet we'll have our brother come out and minister to us and what do I do what I do what I do well repent that's what the Bible says first first thing you do repent then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if we'll start doing that we'll be a lot better off amen and um we just need to pray for him he has some situations going on with family life and and always the devil's going to be there so you know he's going to be the first one to he'll jab you with the closest he can jab you with first right he will first the closest saying he knows to get to you he'll jab you first but you know what just take them and go on do just like Muhammad Ali used to say hey old Muhammad Ali brother jul for said Muhammad Ali he get he looked like he's about gone he said all he's doing is going I'm going to whip you boy so don't matter if he got the devil leaning all over you just look at him I'm going to whip you boy through the Lord Jesus Christ we've already want anyway so just give it to the Lord let the Lord have it and uh it's good to see that it's refreshing that's a breath of fresh air and some good clean water that we've got and we appreciate our brothers um being available to to let brother Franklin come in and and like I said him help some of the ones that's coming from the world that that sometimes detach their s so much like he said you know like you know I start to talk to him about the Lord and it's like whoa you know you go into this turtle shell that was just this is your time this is your place and you know if you ever need anything you got a family praying for you all right anytime anytime let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart again as our brother comes Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord good to have brother Aaron and the eyes of my heart I want to see you I want to see you you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you oh I want to see you to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy [Music] Holy Holy Holy Holy You Are Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I want to see you yes amen amen man Franklin you made that seem so easy you just came running up here wow okay um let's open our Bibles to St Luke the sixth chapter thank you guys that was awesome St Luke the 6th chapter we'll be reading in the uh verses 17 18 and 19 we're there oh you guys are quick all right I don't hear Pages no more pretty quick um let's see okay so let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord I ask father again here we are the second service Lord and Lord you knew I was nervous from the first one and here I am at the second one so I ask father that you'll help us today move me out the way Lord and may it be a blessing to those around us father in Jesus name we pray amen so here in St Luke the 6th chapter it says in the 17th verse it says and he came down with them and stood in the plain now in in I was reading it in a different I don't know if it was the NIV or something else but it said that he came down and stood on a level ground so he came and stood on level ground and the company and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of Judea and Jerusalem and from the Sea Coast and of Tyree and cyan which came to hear him and to be healed of all of their diseases and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all so you may have your seats so so now that all the bitterness is gone right now that all the bitterness is gone uh let me go here today's topic I didn't give you guys the last one but today's uh now that you have virtue right now we're going through the statue ourselves and we're on virtue right now but um it says here and I don't have that much notes this time wait uh somebody was telling me keep it to 15 minutes so we get out of here so I've been already warned and if I don't do that I get fed to the pit bools next door I heard the dogs barking next door you know who said that right T brother Terrence yeah brother Terence I'm going feed you them pit bulls boy they call me boy down here I don't know what that means but anyway so um so yeah I just found that interesting that he came and stood on level ground so you know level ground Faith the new birth right you got a good foundation he came and stood on level ground and once he was on level ground he was able to accomplish something and you know for us that's what the Lord's trying to bring us to up through the statue of a perfect man because there's something he wants to accomplish through us you know we know that Jesus said he was the first fruits right well guess what you can get to become first fruits too so you know that's what we're working towards now we're trying to get all the bitterness and Malice and everything that's that troubles us out of our lives and that way we can have love one for another we can move forward and help those around us you know like I said I believe that the statute of a perfect man is not so much for you even though it's your challenge but it's for others you know what I mean and there's a work to be done and it's a short work because you see the day we're living in you know not to mention brother way done preached 1977 so that puts us at 20 2026 and that's right around the corner so something's going to happen Trump's going to mess it all up right even though we all want Trump in he's just a fun kind of guy I guess I know he just says funny things Little Rocket Man I thought that was funny ain't it a brother Aaron Little Rocket Man but uh so yeah Jesus came and stood on level ground and and you see that he started he went to work there so it says the M ma major benefits I was going to preach a different sermon um oh it's not oh there it is let me go I was going to preach a different sermon on uh uh salt uh the salt of the earth but I didn't I didn't get to it but I do touch it here a little bit but I just find it interesting that there are a lot of people that are dehydrated think about that you understand what I'm saying right now dehydrated and so so you can't hold water when you dehydrated it's hard to hold water you must have some salt you know what I'm saying and so there's going to be people around you right that's going to draw virtue I Noti one of the first things when when um when when I came to the new birth I started noticing there was people around me that were trying to draw something you got to get it for yourself obviously but when when you come to the New Birth there's just a glow about you right it's it's newness it's like meeting your girlfriend for the first time and everything's glowing and everything you ain't sleeping on the couch yet and all that but uh you know it's a situation to [Laughter] where you can't do nothing wrong boy but uh I remember one time uh uh man here I go off my my notes but I remember one time I we we had just started dating and my wife received this huge bouquet at the house and um I'm not romantic my dad didn't teach me to be romantic that's yeah we messed up there but um but uh so she got this huge bouquet of flowers and I walked over I came over to the house and um she was like oh thank you and I'm like I ain't give you those where you get those from it was her last boyfriend right huh your last so I'm like man my goodness I said well we get to share them together I started smelling them what yeah I'm going get back to my nose here but yeah so well you know the salt of the earth but huh yeah I got one I yeah I put one in yep and um I told Brother way to remind me to put a prayer cloth in here but uh cuz you get you you know sometimes you forget and you're all over the place but but anyway so you know it's a situation to where you know you got to now that you've the Lord's brought you to a place where you got all these things out of your life he can use you you can be a vessel you know what I mean and and there's a lot of work right there's a lot of work a family members Frank Franklin just came up here and spoke I I remember talking to him through the years and his sister his sister living the perfect Christian Life right you come over you see her she's just been you know but it just it just wasn't there you know and just be salty never give up never give up don't give up never too late never too late so you know if there's someone that you're praying for or or someone's on your heart or or or things of that nature just don't just keep keep in there keep in there I'm thinking about Rahab right now it's not in my notse but you know Rahab was able to convince her family to come into a home where she did her thing understand that think about that her father come into her home where she did her place of business and she was able to convince them right now the Bible says that she redeemed her father the Bible says that she brought honor to her father so you know it's a situation where you know it doesn't matter what what it may look like the circumstances you know uh the time will come God's appointed time and and that's what happened with Franklin but um here it says here uh unity in the body therefore I a prisoner in the Lord exhort you to walk worthy of the calling that which were you you were called with all humility and gentleness with patience bearing with one another in love being diligent to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace one body one Spirit just as you were called into one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all ain't that beautiful and I know that's been said many of times but just you know it's you that doesn't never get old because it doesn't matter what what the conditions is what it looks like now God is still God and he's in all through all above all he's everywhere so he's in charg am and uh we just keep pressing forward and and you know like myself I got a picture of my family that sits above the fireplace there at my house and every morning me and my wife will drink coffee before I go to work and I'm constantly praying for each one the family is growing and each one's coming in and and it's just like you know what my dad you know my dad claimed his ground right we were my dad's ground right we come from my dad and so now I'm claiming my ground and you claim your ground right CLA claim your cold workers claim the ones that give you water you know the ones that are good to you your boss that's good to you you know because it's it's it's getting late it's late we're Burning Midnight Oil right now I had preached a sermon one time about the uh uh trimming your lamps and um it's beautiful when you look at the uh the oil the oil lamp you know you see that oil lamp like this and then it's got the uh oil at the bottom of it then it's got the the wick in it and then it's got the uh the flame you know and and when you look at that it's like that oil defies gravity think about that that oil has to divide gravity you know it's drawn upward right we got to divide gravity folks you you understand what I'm saying we got to get that flame lit right we got to get that flame lit so you know when when you look at that oil lamp I seen that's what I seen right there may identify gravity you know and I was telling brother Wade I said you know a lot of times when I was younger I always thought about taking the body change I said man that's going to be hard you got to defy gravity yeah you know that's like the hard part but that's actually the easy part folks think about it this the hard part this right here is the hard part where your cowork somebody cut you off right right so you know it's a situation to where you know the easy part is when and I was telling brother Wade think how easy it's going to be when your loved ones start coming walking in here brother brother Ray and all these brothers that come walking in I don't know all of them my dad knows and that's his job but all the other brothers they come walking in right now now wait a minute you was in the grave yeah and you in here now so any doubt you had about taking a body change about 30 days you going to be out of here that's right so don't don't don't focus on the body change so much Focus here and you had you've had aund and how many sermons 120 something sermons they ain't got no excuse here so you know and I hey I ain't got no excuse either cuz I'm tired with y'all so all right all right so it says here um I want to show y'all something real quick I was I I did a a little study on the butterfli I preached a message on a butterfly there at church and uh how many y'all like butterflies go ahead Lise you can raise your hand all right okay you ain't that tough all right all right I like butterflies too but you know it's a situation to where you know you got butter a butterfly here so the butterfly just that that first butterfly right there that's that's God okay that's God and so when you're born when you're born you're that egg you're that you came from God right now you got some end stars that happen here and during these end Stars okay during these in stars all that caterpillar does is eat Munch Munch Munch Munch Munch Munch M that's all it does eat think about that that's right right we got to eat folks keep eating right and you keep growing you keep keep shedding it keeps shedding it keeps growing growing growing and then finally it gets to a place where it goes into the Crysis here you see the Crysis now I was telling brother way I don't know about you cuz I always wonder they always said brother brandom came to adoption right you've heard that term it's come to adoption it confused me at first because I'm like well adoption that's the body change well there's layers of it we know that right well if you if you look at that crysalis you see the clear crysalis you see the wings in there that's where brother Brandon wound up right there you see that but when the dead in Christ rise he going to Flap he going to fly you see what I'm saying so so now I understood it I understood it while I was studying oh that's what happened to brother brandom he he got his wings he came to adoption but there'll come a time he'll fly and when he flies I hope he he nice be nice he come over here right and visit y'all a little bit then come up our way I said up our way Christian I done messed up a couple times he's probably over there laughing he's got me a couple times but that's okay but you know you come to a place where you you you're coming up the statue of a perfect man and like I've always like I believe it's not so much for you even though you have to achieve it it's for others right so so so guess what you're a steward you know know what a steward is somebody that manages something that don't belong to them right so you know um I I I think of it this way uh uh when I was a deacon in the other Church there uh one night all the ministers were gone so they were like hey come here I'm like yeah we need y'all to speak to the youth I'm like what that was my first time ever speaking so I was like nervous so I went home started studying I came up with stewardship but you know it's a situation where I was able to talk to the youth there and um I told him it's you know David was given sheep but it wasn't his sheep it was his father's sheep so he was a steward of his father sheep and because he did right the lord gave him a nation but it still wasn't his Nation it was God's people you know so you know no matter how you cut it you slice it you know your children don't belong to you you know my wife don't belong to me you know you understand what I'm saying my my own my own body my own self I don't belong you understand so I'm just I'm just a manager of it and uh we got to we got to do right by it so um and then um you know I'll go ahead and give this uh this testimony about the virtue and and things like that so what happened was for me one day uh in 20 uh October 2nd of 2015 I went to service on a Friday I was at the bottom Barrel looking up life things were pretty bad for me and uh we were in the midst of a divorce me and my wife and um I said you know what I'm go back to church you know let me try church so I went back and the pastor was there or not the pastor but a minister was in town preaching um uh what was what was his name huh Bill y yeah brother Bill yance anybody know brother Bill y Wild Bill yance yeah he's special to me he's aggressive but uh anyway so he was preaching he was talking about the man at the pool of Bethesda and how he laid in that condition for 38 years and I always thought I had a motorcycle at the time I used to ride a lot of motorcycle stuff like that and I was one of them crazy guys on the highway with one them going 130 M hour but um you know I always thought I was going to die at 38 my my serial number was 38 at the end I just I just thought you know my life was in shambles and stuff like that and uh um but anyway so he come to town he started preaching he he's talking about the man at the P of pesda and and uh he's like man you know that man laid in that POS in that condition for 38 years and when he said that there was something moving it started stirring I became that man I became them scriptures and uh I'll tell you what man right there at my seat I metant the shik glory fell down on my face my Bible's ruined I got so much spit and uh tears and all kinds of stuff it burnt the hole in that in that chapter right there but um brother way you got a new Bible I said yeah that other one was beat up but but and then I wanted to get one to where I don't have the the things I got to I can't cheat no more you know what I mean I got to try to find it you know cuz you know we're up here now so I got to try to do more do better right we always got to try to do better so U but anyway the testimony was uh after that had happened I went home and I said hun I said you know when you received the baptism of the Holy Spirit do you um share it with anybody and uh what you say huh just just live the life don't say nothing just live the life that's what she said she always man she always wisdom she always helped me out but um anyway so so I said okay huh so about two weeks later mind you in the in the in the past I was a very involved in sports I like to stay active played a lot of sports I went to all the games Browns games Cav games I was always at games and stuff like that and I always wanted to meet a player get an autograph make eye contact let them hug me you know stuff like that you know now I know what they feel like now when I hug Michael when I when I hug Michael was like hugging LeBron you know so it's like oh that's how big they are all right so you know I always wanted to you know meet somebody or something like that but you know it's a situation to where um about two weeks later after all of this I done gave up I gave up uh all my season tickets I gave up sport I turned the Apple card over we got rid of all our TVs I stopped watching sports um we just focused we barreled down we really did and um uh was I gonna say uh oh I was at Franklin's house that's I was say uh we gave him up in 2015 and in 2016 the Cass won the championship we were laughing we were like that's how it works you know but um so where am I going oh so about two weeks later I walked into a five guys and I was as I was walking up I looked in the the the mirror the windows and there was this big black guy he was a big boy and he kept staring at me so I'm like oh I ain't getting shoved in no garbage can again so I just walked in I walked in like this and I'm walking past him and this big old Mick grabbed me he grabbed me he snatched me out the aisle and pulled me this close like I was this close face to face with him he was sitting down still taller than me and I'm standing up looking at him but he was like where you going little fella I said I'm going to order me a burger and he was like well you look like you going to take over over the world let's talk for a minute and so the first thing come to my mind was my wife said just live it and I'm like but I want to talk to somebody about it so I said let's go to John we turned over and I didn't have my Bible obviously I had my phone so we turned over to first uh John chapter 5 p man of P of Bethesda and so I started telling them about my testimony and all the things and everything we had been through and stuff like that and I guess apparently he was talking to everybody else in there this man was talking to everybody else in there so they were all watching us well we're both crying we're talking about the word we're both crying and uh he stood up at one point he said you guys are all my cousins they must have said cousin or something he said but this man here is my brother and uh and yeah so so we're just talking about the Lord and he says you know I never eat this food I'm on a strict diet but I just wanted to break you know break away and get me a burger from Five Guys he says this was a divine intervention he said keep me in prayer because I'm looking for a wife I want the right wife I want to be married I want the right right so we prayed there together and he left and I went up to the counter and they were like did you know that guy and I'm like uh n he just snatched me out the air I like one of them flies and he he me me but uh he he snatched and they were like well you know he plays for the Browns I'm like oh really and I was like shocked and I ordered my food I walked out of but I started thinking like all these years I wanted to meet one of them but the Lord he had he had it to where you going to meet one and you going to give them a message from me so yeah that was that was nice I never forget that though anybody anybody ever have an experience to where the Lord put you in a place to talk to someone and and it would just something good come out of it yeah yes amen amen so here it says in Genesis 1 128 it says and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth in Genesis 2:15 it says and the Lord God took the man and put him him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep it be fruitful multiply replenish subdue profitable growth increase good stewardship let's understand the definition of stewardship it says here stewardship is the office or duties of obligations of a steward the conducting supervising or managing of something especially the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one's care so basically managing something that isn't yours remember everything belongs to God everything in your possession belongs to God you came into this world with nothing and you leave out this world with nothing even even in the body change I put here you won't be taking your timolin all of all of us one day will stand in judgment and and and give account of what we did with ourselves you know so that that's why earlier I was talking about you know having um bitterness and things like that we have to those things have to be gone we got we got to shed those things we got to get rid of those things and and sometimes it's going to come you it's it's going to cause you to be in humility right because you're going to feel like well I ain't the one in Fault right but you know what Jesus wasn't at fault right in fact he didn't even say nothing I mean this man that thought he had power was looking at the man who gave him the power and you know he's he's said what do you got to say for yourself he had nothing to say cuz he was thinking about you you know Lord he was looking he was looking past the crowds and he was looking into this Dimension looking at this church right now all these people sitting here amen it says I've never believed that in heaven was a place where there's a bunch of buildings there's a bunch of houses up there they're made with mortar d with paper paint on the wall I've never believed that supernatural being would have to live in a literal house I believe when Jesus spoke in John 14 he said in my father's house as many mansions he meant a body a dwelling place for the scriptures verify the same thing says if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I will have one already waiting you see mortal beings is the only one who lives in Mortal habitations Immortal beings live in Immortal habitations then the place that will go into until we return back is not a place of brick mortar and clay and precious stones or Jewels it's a place of condition right it's a place of condition we have to condition ourselves now right because because D I think Dad mentioned it earlier but we have to we have to do here to match there right amen I remember Jesus praying in John said I think it was John 17 he's saying he's saying as as it is in heaven as it is here let that it also be also in heaven you know what I mean so there's a matching that needs to to go on so it says uh in here in Romans 8:23 not only so but we ourselves who have have the first fruits of the spirit grown inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sunship the Redemption of our bodies and that's what the that's what I believe brother Wade you're coming up through now and stuff like that so that's great um I have to get in my studies and and and learn more myself I don't I don't know half to stuff by the way no but you know what it don't matter I'm going to get the same reward right yeah you that first hour I'm the 11th but I'mma get it I'm get I'mma Be right next to you so amen so but you know what that's all I got today I don't have that much today and I just pray just keep us in prayer there in Lorraine and and um you know uh working there I understand now brother brandom said about being the to the team and and bringing things back into sweetness and stuff like that and the ox is a burden Bearer and and things like that and just keep us all in prayer and you know we're all overworked right now we got many hats all of us have many hats right now I'm sure when you guys started did a lot of people had the same like many hats yeah then you get to spread it out a little bit so it's a it's a little much but we going to get through it I'm waiting on some good good Brothers to come on in and and uh we just made Franklin and the Usher recently I'm praying on a deacon right now but Franklin's our Usher right now and and uh he likes to take coats where'd you learn that from the south cuz up north was like man hang your old coat up but uh yeah so yeah he's well who was born in the South Franklin was wasn't he Alabama Franklin was your dad was in the Army you was born in Alabama okay you got it in you Alabama considered the south or no all right but brother waade I if you don't mind come sing a song okay I wanted to sing a song but I didn't know if it it was good enough but my my favorite song is down from his glory so come on up huh yep Franklin Franklin would you like to sing back here okay how about Melissa Melissa would you like to come up yes he man no Melissa just remember folks I was talking to a couple uh brothers and sisters a little earlier if you had that nudge like if if there's something that needs to be made right with somebody and you you feel that nudge remember Satan's always going to look to keep the vision right right if you feel that little unction or that little nudge God's in the business of reconciliation so if you feel that move on that he'll be with you and if you're rejected he was rejected right so down from his glory do they got the words uh who's BR who's back brother brother um Anderson Brother Anderson can you please put the words up down from his glory I don't know if I said it or not oh thank you this a good start you 188 brother we got it up there okay down from his [Music] glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a strer a Man of Sorrows tears and oh how I

now I know Thou Are The Great I Am oh how I love him how I adore him my breath my [Music] sunshine my all in all the great Creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in it yes amen you know I wanted to say I wanted to say this real quick too um we was at Poppy's house last night we got to go see him and pay some respects we call it paying respects but uh when we was over there out of all the stuff he had he had a lot of guns and just all kinds of stuff and um out of everything he had in his closet he had a whole bunch of old cassette tapes and when we looked at that we seen gold so we was trying to figure out a way to get up underneath the house and cut a hole and then snatch it so every basically what I'm trying to say is you know we we we cherish the ministry here we really do and we're so thankful that uh you know that you know that pops uh he was able to get on it so what he didn't tell you was he's not really well did you tell him you're not too Savvy with the internet and all that okay but he he went out and got a old Xbox my dad ain't never been with Xboxes a PlayStation he totally against it but he went out and got one cuz that's his way to get on YouTube and that's how he found you guys here so how you doing Bella good I didn't get I don't think I got to shake your hand but um but yeah so it's a situation to where um you know we're just grateful for that that uh brother Samuel's been such a blessing in our lives a great blessing so I like to leave it with that brother way I think that's good so what I do call you up now or the musician is already up here so all right list he asked me the first service after first service he said how' I do I said wor sermon I have yeah he did I said that's pretty good that's what Dr Davis said about brother brandom okay so he got his start that way why can't he get his start that way you know you cry at funerals you make people cry Wedding made people brother R said I made them cry you didn't even make him cry let's give him another good hand you know sometimes we forget um brother John that when we started that Journey it was a tender time where everything was like was important and I'm not saying it's not important but I when we walked into that at um in the dad's hunting closet which is huge and and I forgot they were there and there's a stack sure enough they probably from 1996 to to 2000 cassette tape so there's a stack that's big sitting on the floor and I just walked around him you know for all the time of getting stuff for that and him getting stuff he I didn't forgot he stored them in there but I knew that it meant something to them when they were like you know I'm looking at the hunting stuff I'd be looking at the hunting stuff they're going what's that I said what's that rich said what's that I said this cassette tape and they're like what's underneath this floor I said the garage they said drill a hole up through the I told Mom last night I when we left I said Mom if you hear something sound like I said they going to be downstairs stealing them tapes but that meant something to them like with us it was just something we walk by come on somebody it's like something we walk by didn't even look at it didn't even notice it but it meant a lot to them this ministry meant a lot to people you know we we laugh about it about people you know sleeping and stuff here but but uh but God's word will never return void will accomplish as you heard brother Keith Reed stand right here he's going to Africa and preach now and and that he's preaching away and he he listens to to some of Dad's old tapes and then now or old sermons and and so he goes over there and he's preaching on a a subject and two or three ministers walk up to him and say we know where you got that from he said why he said we said we got brother Dale's tapes over here Africa [Applause] so um it won't return void it'll accomplish exactly what it said it would accomplish amen and like brother Keith readed always said he told Brother Dale he said brother Dale you're not always preaching just right here that's right he said you're preaching to the world right same way with all of us too like brother Isaac was saying I mean and that's true that that's really not for us right do you understand what he meant it was for others to see that in us that I see it in myself is really selfish it's something I see no but if somebody will see it in me as as with as brother Franklin you know you last time you I saw him you know he's um tatted up and t-shirt on and shorts on and I'm like man where did they get that guy I did offer you to be baptized though I did and you almost did but it wasn't his time this was his this was his this is his time amen amen so just remember
