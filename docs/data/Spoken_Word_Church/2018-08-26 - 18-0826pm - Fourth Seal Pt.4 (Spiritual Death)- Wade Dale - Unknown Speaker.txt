out some move in some move out and God's got the whole thing worked out you know we you know we get ready to to have a gap and God's already got to fail you know so that's just the way it is he knew before the foundation world what we needed anyway so he's not surprised about anything what we were talking about this morning you know it how could God have fear he knows what's gonna happen he's already seen it happen how can you be afraid tomorrow we're afraid what happens because we don't know what's coming tomorrow or the next day but God knew it from the foundation the world what's coming so he has no fear but I'm gonna read you a quote here in a minute I read last Sunday where we are prophetic people so we should be able to have no fear we should trust in the one that's already been there the one that's already done it you know so good to be in the house of Lord let's turn to revelation 6 and go ahead and get started and it's not six one seven through eight they fixed it today we're going to speak a little bit about spiritual death but we're gonna background a little bit in this fourth seal and I'm having a good time with the foresail because it's it's getting out of here time everything's finishing it's coming to a close coming to an end and we're getting ready to get out of here so by way of announcements remember Bible study next Saturday from 6 to 8 that'll be September the 1st that will also be Labor Day weekend so Lord bless you and have a safe time that weekend brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night brother John and sister Maya don't start crying again I miss them already but let's just pram home and then you know what praying back here a man God answers prayers right ok all right and brother Russ good to have him with us here on the front row up to fire falls right here brother hey man Firefall dryin if you fall asleep when the fire falls if you fall asleep I wake you okay so good to have brother Russ dunker with us from Minnesota and and you I think you've made me feel welcome so just continue to do that so uh and also remember keep us in your prayers June and I start our festival season next weekend so we'll be having festivals first probably two or three months in a row so just pray that the Lord will bless us and we always have a good time then we get to witness and then we get to sell some honey and make some money honey and money that sounds pretty good revelation 6 verse 7 through 8 let's bow our heads before we get started the Lord Jesus we know Lord that without you here today it's just a meeting of of opinions and minds and and almost like a brother Browne said called the Church of the lodge Lord we don't want this to be a lodge we want this to be a supernatural happening today Lord that you break through Lord and reveal yourself to us through your word that you'll break back the scales from our eyes and Lord that you will help us to understand more about you father we pray that you'd forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make Lord bless each one that's here Lord that are sick you said you sent the word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions the Lord his word goes forth we've seen it many times before that you'll heal them sitting in their seats Lord because they're listening to the Word of God Lord would pray that you just bless and take care of us be the ones that are on the highways brother John and sister my lord what a kindred spirit that we feel that we've had torn from us but Lord we we pray that you'd keep them safe get them back home Lord for with their family father be with each one take care brother the rest would be with him tomorrow Lord as he flies back home that we will get a good report from told him when he got here that we'd try our best to fill him up so maybe we can fill him up and he can go speak your word up to those people up there father we asked your blessings on this service now the words already anointed now I pray that you anoint us father give us this day our daily bread and Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 7 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth and you can be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word we'll get started we won't need the chart today so I think we pretty much caught up on the chart as far as the church ages because I was reading last night or this morning earlier where brother Branham said that that's been vindicated the church ages have been vindicated all the messengers have been vindicated the messenger the message to the aged what's going on in that church age has all been vindicated even before the seals broke and then when the seals broke there they were that's why that God had to line the church ages at first before he brought the seven seals because they had to coincide our carburetor with each other they had to be like we're gonna read today a few things that happened and we've read in all the church ages when we have the chart up here so we're not gonna bring the chart anymore I think you understand that the rapture takes place on the fourth seal and it is in the seventh Church age first three ages first seal right Amen second seal the dark ages third seal Luther and Wesley fourth seal is the Eagle age which is our age right now that's what the rapture takes place on the fourth seal now there's three more seals to go and we must see the revelation of those all those like brother Dale will come up this morning Christ in on the seventh seal if Christ is not here we're not going anywhere that's the problem now you say well no yeah Christ is in you the hope of glory but there's more for us to get there's more for us to get or we would already be gone because when we get enough to get the Dead out of the ground then we're done here I said we're done here all right so and then God goes over to Israel but we must see these seals open you must see them for yourself you got to see it whether I see it or not is really no concern to you it just we need to all help each other that's why we have questions and we we have the Bible study there at downstairs for a couple hours and and we just kind of you know sit around informal and ask questions and they was one guy said one time he said well here we are Bible study and we're not a moment in the Bible well then you know we then we we titled it wrong maybe we should call it questions and answers of for anything because we don't really pick a scripture we used to but now that everybody's bringing questions in then we just have questions and answers so it's just a real nice thing to do and it's free some of it some of you'll pay and go see a movie or a car race or something but you won't come to Bible study so you know all these other things that goes on you know what I'm sorry but like would say right here the last plague to hit the Church of spiritual death that's the last plague that's the last one there's not another one spiritual death is it one spiritual death comes then then you know what did there's no reviving someone spiritually dead now physically dead the dead is going to come back but if they're spiritually dead they're not coming back to the white throne judgment and they're gonna have to be judged by their works amen so we want to be dead in Christ and man we want to be dead there's nothing wrong with being dead but dying to the world is what we're talking about not being spiritually dead because brother Branham he comes and tells us I think it I pulled up a quote that they don't have I was just looking it was on unveiling of God before right before the Exodus what happened right before Israel's exodus there was a death the Death Angel came through and killed all the firstborn a man but we are the Church of the firstborn so we are firstborn so we have to be concerned that not only the bloods over the doorpost and whoever that was it was preaching brother Danny and one of them was preaching on that and I thought well man that's good to have the blood but what I want to say is is because the blood was there there was a lamb in the house it was a lamb in the house and that lamb dying is what took their place and that's what you and I should never forget what Jesus Christ did for us sometimes we we you know we forget Calvary but we should never forget what Christ did at Calvary greatest things ever done by human mortal man and he was a human moral man but it was God Almighty and human flesh that man so in Joel 2 let's get started because we were talking last Sunday about coming back in four stages well what we've got to see then in this seal is is that we've got to see that you and I let me put it me let me put it softly nobody nobody has come to this till now that's why I want to put it softly yeah not be Christianizing anybody but nobody because remember and I'll read the quote in a minute after I read the scripture you gotta remember I will restore now when did God start restoring when we know when the day of Pentecost he started restoring the the church bride but it went back down so it going back down it's coming out on the other side to go back to what go back to the full-grain again and that's me and you that's not Luke so that's not Leslie that's not Pentecost that's you and I at this fourth seal because remember the fourth seal you and I somewhere in that fourth seal we've got to take a have a resurrection of the body change some were in there and then which is right now so I will restore you know many people are thinking this many people have read that and preached a restoration message all down through the ages but you know what they were doing they were looking for another day because they never come to full restoration but you and I have come to the full restoration when we come to that fourth beast that combat beast being the eagle that comes to a place that no one's ever been before even though they may have been thousands of sermons preached on I will restore and I can see some of them old you know free will Baptists and fire baptized holiness they probably jump up I will restore and they'll beat the pulpit I'm going to restore I'm going to restore they were just part of it they were just part you and I are the recipient of this scripture being fulfilled that great army I sent among you a master let's read this be glad they're children of Zion which is you and huh and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain now what is the form of rain teaching rain all right brother branham you know that's why did brother Dale talk about this morning the latter rain people the latter rain movement was saying latter rain let it rain let it rain brother sounds like your teachings wrong he didn't really say that but that's what he was meaning you gotta have somebody to line this up and teach you the teaching rain has to come first and you don't even have your saying ladder rain you're saying you're already harvesting mmm they weren't harvesting they didn't know what to harvest they weren't in the same field that we're supposed to be in they didn't know what to harvest but when brother Branham comes he brings what the former rain teaches us that's what's going on now up to a point but remember the latter rain the former rain and the latter rain comes in the first month 30-day period you go from a teaching to a harvest well that can't happen in natural plants but it can happen to me and you a man that 11th island worker like this one sitting here on the front row that's just been listening for two years you know I mean but I was telling him the other night I said man you ain't going to go through all the junk that we went through I don't have to go through the junk he went through so we see the ones that went on before and just kind of cleared back you know the bushes so that we can see better they brought the former rain they brought the teaching rain and we listened and then now there's a harvest coming from that teaching rain there's a latter rain or a harvest and we're coming up here in October and November and that's how our harvest for this part of the country amen and one day God's gonna have a harvest he's gonna harvest but remember he's not going to harvest corn plant this this high was just tassel and I mean stalking to leaves it's a mature plant it's already come to full fruition and it's already brought the fruit and god's gonna harvest that amen and the floor shall be full of wheat and the facts shall overflow with wine and oil showing that the wine and all you got holy ghost in the stimulation of the revelation and I will restore to you he's talking to you today talking to you and me I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar to Palmer my great army I sent among you and you shall eat implanting that's what we're doing now we're eating in plenty we've never had this kind of word to work under even with brother Branham here they didn't understand what he was saying but we do amen we do understand and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be a shame let's just go over this just for a minute I feel we need to the Palmer worm remember what was the Palmer worm the Palmer worm was the first one though these are not in order brother Brennan puts them in order on restoration of the broad tree the Palmer worm is what the fruit so that's the first thing he started eating on was the fruit of the Spirit so Satan eats the fruit out of the out of the building then you started with what the locust next what does the locust the eats the leaves which is the preys which is the fellowship what they keep fellowship they're all in different ships Baptist Presbyterian brand of mites whatever you want to call them they're all in different ships the cankerworm which is eats the bark the bark is a covering which is a religion or doctrine all right and then the caterpillar actually sucks it to life but remember what happened was is it was eating down to a stump but it didn't kill the life because the life went in that root the Bible says I am the root and offspring of David amen so he was in the root and then what he was what I am the vine ye are the branches we're going to bear the fruit that's what's coming back but it had to come back if it died in four stages which it really didn't die it would just eat away it didn't die it was either way but to bring it back you have to bring it back in four stages now why that's why they had to be a lie knocks a man or an eagle for you look in the Book of Ezekiel there's always for you got four beasts that come in the line ox man an eagle to combat the four horse riders to combat what the four spirits of Satan that come into the world even the pom warm glow cos caterpillar in the cankerworm caterpillar that was four so with four def messengers that eat it away they had to be for life or life the messengers bring it back which is what we've been talking about in the seals justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word incarnate now I want to explain something to you about that let's stop from it he said well then Luther wasn't the word incarnate yes Luther was the word incarnate for his day but remember I want to read you that quote bring up that next quote if I get too loud borrow his earplugs yeah at least you can hear me say that that's alright I am a little loud sorry but what I'm going to set this box look this was so profound that a prophet would say I'm gonna set this box up right here to represent that if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing they can work by is the spirit that works among them now will prove to you by the history of the church by the opening of the seals and the power that let loose and what's exactly the church respond to the anointing they couldn't do nothing else Luther couldn't do anything else but believe the just shall live by faith that was gardening Curnutt but that wasn't God couldn't work in completeness or in his fullness he could not work pleased to dwell in lucre absolutely pleased to dwell in let Wesley absolutely but like somebody out with you telling us about the Lutheran had a Lutheran priest woman somebody was telling us that the woman yeah and said her dress was so short well I'm not gonna tell you what happened but anyway this blue Turin woman is standing up preaching the Lutheran Church with a skirt that if you raise their hands you could anyway but now Luther did not that was had nothing to do with Luther that was all what happened after Luther left what that bug got in there and got to eating at that denomination they started what disfellowshipping Lutheran's has got it and the Westlands has got it and this one's got it but Martin Luther would absolutely well he'd try the church up if he saw that Lutheran doctrine from what he said the just shall live by faith to come to that that's what we've come to and that's why we want to speak today on on spiritual death because that's the worst natural deaths not bad spear for death is worth because if we keep living long enough who naturally where most of us are gonna die but you can be spiritually dead and sit right here amen so so Martin Luther had the word for this day but when we say justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the word incarnate that means that if God is excuse me God has come to a place to where there's no more there's no more denomination there's no more doctrine there's no more church age messenger there's no more group of people coming up this is it this is it this is the completion the fullness Auerbach's is look their box was this our boxes we're going home there's no more box that's going to be we don't have another you know we're not doing this now this is that this is us this is done there's nothing here we're going home alright but we got to get ready it's not just gonna automatically happen amen so let's go to number number two and just prove one thing here now the fourth beast that was sent forth we're gonna background a little bit the fourth beast that was sent forth to combat the Antichrist in this last beast are you ready the last beast that was sent forth or the last power to combat the Antichrist who was against the teaching of God the Antichrist was an eagle the fourth living beast was an eagle now you just study the ages study the scripture it's an eagle and in the Bible the last age was an eagle age and guard like in the Eagle to his prophet now watch the last days the Eagle aid a revealer of the true word in other words a revealer of all the word a man a reveal of a revealer not just of the just shall live by faith that was a box that was a church age but then God moved well what happened Lutheran's stayed where they were but God moved on into Wesley into Pentecost into the message of the hour and then we're going out of here but what happened with the Lutheran's they said well this is all we got and that's it until they stayed right there all right and they spiritually died amen let's go to number three now notice we find this fella here as an eagle this man this living creature that's poured forth here now or in other words there's four different ages of it there's an age of the line we find out that this being the fourth age and he said come and see the fourth mystery of the book of Redemption that's been hidden in this book so don't forget that the seals are for our Redemption not just to reveal the devil no it's for our Redemption but it's showing where he is amen John went to sea and he saw a pale horse and again the same rider upon this pale horse now he has a name called death now notice none of the other riders none of the other horses or no time that this rider ever rode they didn't have that man had no name but now he's called death it's not mentioned see he's revealed now what he is is death well how do we linger on that for a sermon and make it real plain how we could but anything that's an tyre that's against the real has to be death because there's only two subjects life and death all right so that's all we're talking about today there's two subjects life and death that's it and that proves that the Holy Spirit's revelation of this and this day is exactly the truth so we're living under the full truth of the of the of the age and then and the anti he's death because the word as we see it later on is life and this man is called death let's go to the fourth number four still in the fourth seal now it's not mention of the other times of this writer but since now it's mentioned that he's called death but under the revelation of the line now I want you to read this close I'll be sure he wrote that down under not under the revelation of the line age or the first day now remember that was part of it was revealed because Paul even said Grievous wolves are among you that different things you know that he knew there was an anti spirit among the people then John goes to Patmos and sees all the things happen and then he comes back and calls it the Antichrist he didn't say it was the anti devil he said it was Antichrist Amen so he knew what it was we were talking the other night you know John even admired we see these big churches and we see these big programs and we see these big things they're doing it's beautiful but so was Cannes Cannes offering was probably looked like you know a cornucopia of of colors and all the harvest and if you were standing there you go I might just pick this one instead of that bloody lamb over there squirting blood all over them you know the rock and Abel probably looked like he had been slayed itself you know but which one would you pick same thing but it's not by sight it's by what the word says amen now under the revelation of the line age of the first days the early age this wasn't revealed the next age was the age of the arts which is the dark age we just said that in the middle age the dark ages it wasn't revealed as what it was nor the man-like beasts of wisdom which is what Luther and Wesley Church age five and six trying to back up for I know this is we've done this over but they some here that had been here so we're gonna back up we're gonna listen we all gonna go together or we ain't going we all going together oh we're not going Lutheran Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the Eagle Age the last stage watch this now this is what I want us to see that we are in the Eagle lays the last days the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterance now we know that utterance came from a prophet called William Branham but when he passed on he didn't take it with him he called us little Messiah he called us eaglets so whatever prophetic utterance he had is going to rise in a group of people and it's literally gonna bring that man out of the ground that who was gonna happy even the things we were talking about in the book of Romans you know Paul preached and prophesied many many things which are alive and remain and like my brother Dale was coming out you know they without us cannot be made perfect Paul was sitting there but Paul knew in his mind he wasn't gonna see it he knew he wasn't gonna say it but he was writing the very thing that we need to see so the same way with brother Branham he preached a prophetic message but preaching the preaching a prophetic message had to be to a group of people that was coming not the people that were sitting there a group of people that was coming not you you we are the recipients of this prophetic message so now you and I are not prophetic we're here we're in other words we're not prophesying of another group coming there's not brother Nels not standing up and saying you're not getting this this is not even for you this is for somebody else brother I'm stood up on the only question as an answer to the seals he said it's not even for you it's not even for you greatest message he ever preached he never preached anybody that understood it but you and I are here we are recipients of a prophetic utterance and receiving that prophetic utterance we get the benefit of whatever he preached we get the benefit of and like I said before it will get him out of the ground because he said rapture and faith lies in the books and tapes it just takes a fivefold ministry to put it together to put it together so that what so that that quickening power that's already there can work because we just read this morning in Romans 8 and says the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead being you it'll also quicken your mortal body by that spirit that dwells in you well if you've got the new birth you've got the resurrection inside of you our problem is is we like to keep it wrapped in a cocoon of unbelief hey man yeah that's exactly right you a man or I'll just a man for you for those you there asleep I'll go ahead and a man for you two all right number five let's read this and then we'll make a few more comments hmm cuz this is all background we've this is probably the second time we've done this so so we're just background so watch see the writer the first place as an antichrist he was death to begin with when he started in his infancy when he started in back way back when when the Bible told her that it was just a saying yeah that was death because what happened was somebody believed that and began a new doctrine or a new something else right but it was not named death because it wasn't revealed at the time they had a box all right the Antichrist was death to begin with but he's innocent then sure he was innocent then he received a crown the crown the Pope a triple one and when he did then he United Satan United his church and state what under Constantine because he was over both of them then Antichrist was Satan in the form of a man now we find out his mystery here in this church and state the fourth stage of his ministry he's called the Beast first he's called the Anaconda we got to get through this then he's called false prophet and he's called the beast you know we find here being called as the Beast now I want you to notice this after the fourth horse in this fourth horse if you'll notice the first one was white then the next one was red the next one was black and the fourth one all of these other three were represented in it because pale is red and white and so mixed together it's all mixed in this one horse see there's become four or actually the three in one because remember there's not four stages of a new birth there's only three but you got justification sanctification the baby but the baby's got to grow right Satan the same way he comes from white to red to black to pale which he's what going to be incarnate in a beast kind of funny he incarnated the Beast and went in the garden and now he's going to incarnate a beast and take over the try to take over the world it began with codes remember that's the continuity of God Satan started his the beef he's going to end up as a beef he just had to deceive one woman back then see now he's deceived one woman the church but many members of that now right that's what he's trying to do with me and you he's trying to pull us over to just be one word off that all right all of these three were represented because pale is red and white and so mixed together mixed into one horse so don't get it wrong it's three-in-one so it's it's justification sanctification and baptism the Holy Ghost God incarnate God moving in human being same way with Satan white red black and Satan moving in a human being a man so that's what's coming up now but remember one thing here's a good little point for you to ponder if we go up on the fourth seal if we take a rapture then Satan is destroyed in us under that fourth seal Satan's destroyed in us now he's not destroyed he's still doing his work but remember I read you that scripture they laid Jesus stood one day and said the prince of this world has come and has nothing in me now we can say that and then tomorrow he's gonna make you prove it tomorrow Satan's gonna make you prove that amen but one day you know what he's going to try to make you prove it and it's not going to happen he's gonna try to make you prove it and it's not going to happen because remember he just keeps going and keeps going but watch this right here number six go the next one fourth seal now I want you to notice the four of them notice the off mark of four of the spiritual mathematics because God is 3 this is 4 here is 4 here first Antichrist white second false prophet red third VY kyrov heavens and earth and purgatory black fourth the Beast that's for Pale Horse Satan being kicked out of heaven now we were talking about that the other night about heaven remember yeah heaven is a place because brother Branham said God's got a house he lives in a house he lives in heaven alright but I thought you and I were supposed to be in heavenly places if we're born again alright so it's not heaven to me as not the Bible even says heaven and earth will pass away but it took a prophet to come and line that up because the old denominational idea is that man God's just going to blow this universe away and we're going our brand-new well that's not Redemption that's replacement redemption is taking what's already here amen taking what's already here redeeming it and making it eternal man you ought to get them and that's just the plan of God that's just the plan but he took a profit though because every other denomination is anti against that every other denomination proves to you there's an eternal hell amen proves to you that we have to go through a seven-year tribulation right and even the the Catholics prove that there's a purgatory which there's no such thing but they prove it to you because somebody walked in it somebody's walking in it now but you and I though Satan has been kicked out of your heaven if you're born again Satan's been kicked out of your heaven you want to read it read revelation 12:13 Michael which is Christ fought Satan and cast him out of heaven when you're born again Satan is cast out of your soul is that all right oh no how was this eternal something well then you just take that Redemption out you if you always was you us I mean Jim we're talking yesterday or day before we do talk please day before yesterday we were talking about listen I said you know I said if this is how I hate this doctrine of the of the preaching of the seed because if I came here with an anything eternal in me different then even Judas Iscariot then on the day of judgment God being a just God Judas could walk up to the day of judgment and say God you can't send me to hell because you didn't make like that guy if you judge me you got judge him the same way and you put something in him you didn't put it in me so I never had a chance so you can't condemn me you see what I'm saying but Judas now can't walk up and say that because you and I were born in saying you and I were born just like he was we had the same choice he had Amen in the mind of God sure we were there sure we were a a word a seed word but I'm telling you people the things me and you did God wasn't nowhere around was he no okay alright thank you no God wasn't nowhere around I was an unclean vessel and he wasn't there but thank God he come in and burned all that old out and then I did realize that's what the sales to me it sure it makes me realize where I did come from the journey everybody wants to talk about the trail of the serpent I won't talk about the trail of Christ and man everybody wants to talk about the trail of the serpent weirdest herb well I know where the serpent was at one time he resided here I don't know about you but he resided in here but when he left that's one of the the first the first seal that first rider brother Brian said here stands a lamb and there goes a wild horse rider there was something riding away from that profit that was must have been there amen even Paul like we were talking about this morning Paul said the things I would not I do the things I do it wouldn't not not in his soul but in his spirit realm Satan was playing Satan plays with you and I in that spirit realm but when we realized that the one that's inside and deep down inside is greater than that that's our problem we think well no we're just a human and this is what we do no I can't accept that like I said I don't accept it is what it is and you said it yesterday about cringed it ain't what it ain't it ain't if it is what it is then we'd still be driving model life no it is not people you can change if you say it is what it is that means that you believe God just pulled you through a tube I thought brother Branham says what he predestinated by your desire not his he desired it all be say he predestinated by what you wanted Wow alright we got off the sub you hang on man let's go back number let's go to the next one remember these three things under this sealed death has to be destroyed because you know that's why listen the reason the people in the in the sixth dimension can't come to this dimension is because they're an eternal condition and that would make them have to come back into a place where there's death again is that right so we've got to have death destroyed here and it's only got to happen to one person to break that thing open one person one person Jesus stood up one day and said I am the resurrection and life he didn't need four or five Caiaphas and I eat it out he didn't need them to walk up and say we know he said I I am the resurrection and the life source only gonna tell you one person but what's he wants this destroyed then blaze just like a snowball effect you bring all their majors into this dimension but we can't bring them in this dimension and there's death they don't want I wouldn't hey brother branham even said have I got to go back remember when you went across the curtain time he said I gotta go back why because there was death in that dimension he saw his body laying there 50 years old dying but he was over here in an eternal condition I think that'd be a pretty easy choice but the angel told him you got to go back man because while he was prophesying it was a prophetic if you'll catch something you'll catch that God was showing us that death can be destroyed just in an instant because that's that moment at that split-second of time death was destroyed he was over here and then he had to go back into that other into the back into this dimension but at one period of time he was standing in eternity but that he turned but listen he didn't leave eternity there he took eternity back into this dimension and that's the same way with you you're an eternal person right now like Ernie says brother Villanueva he said you're a spiritual person having a human experience not a human person having a supernatural experience all right so now death has to be destroyed a resurrection has to take place and a rapture takes place on this seal now that's the waste that and look that's the order it's got to come death has to be destroyed first and like brother Dale said and I agree 100% I'm not looking for a rapture a rapture is an event because those other two things have happened but this is not going to happen before they happen this has got to happen and then the rapture can come and that's okay I mean you know people saying I'll see you in the rapture and if we never meet again you know that's okay but that's just like that song they sing when I die hallelujah by and by would that was you know that was wait a minute that was their box this ain't my box anymore my box is over here that says I ain't gonna die well this box says I don't have to these other boxes said yeah you got to die but this box I'm living in says you do not have to die I can't die even though I physically go leave this place I can't die but that death has to be destroyed by somebody not in a grave it's got to be live and you know what as long as we say we can't do it we become unbelievers right we become unbelievers of what somebody's already said was going to happen we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder those who are asleep right now we are not fulfilling that Scripture because we are preventing and hindering those from coming into this dimension why because we have not gotten death destroyed but we will we well but it will not come by these next parts that we're going to talk about the next part we're going to talk about spiritual death it's not going to happen in a denomination that's why brother Branham had to come apart apart from the denomination and tell us where Satan was tell us where we've always known where God was we really have I mean each each age had a born-again believer that knew he was born again new God had changed his life new God was speaking to him but they still had that one little spot they carried that little denominational I deal with them hello I mean really now we got now we know where that is we know the ride that Satan's riding like I said we hey brother I'm didn't have to preach the trail of the serpent we know where that happened we know the trail from Genesis all the way to revelations about what happens to the devil I just want to know where God is if you know where God is then you definitely know the devil ain't there because he can't stand to be in the same place amens all right now listen the symbols just to just the background the symbols are what a pale horse name was death pile was given and a fourth part of the earth fall so there's your symbols of the fourth seal so somewhere in there listen we had to be able to name him death to see the separation thereby getting this look at me the separation had to be that we know that that's death now because remember what we've called life what we've called life has been death yes we call come through denominations swore by you so I never was in the denomination I was always in this message well let's talk a little while let's talk a little while because we're still here amen so we hadn't got him old I demo ideas are not dead yet it'd be a good place for you to sit number 74 they'll notice fully Satan on his throne offered it to God offered it to our Lord remember he did when he was when Jesus was alive he took him up on the came up on the mountain took him up on the pillow of the church you know that's always that's always bothered me Satan was comfortable taking God to church let me say that one more time Satan was comfortable taking God which was Jesus he took Jesus and put him on top of the temple he's comfortable in church Satan is very comfortable and he don't sleep anyway here he is sitting here with this beastly heart in him now here is the person the beast the Incarnate devil now here's the point I want to make because realize one thing's for sure and what gets me is as you hear always a lot of denominations they know that Rome is the Antichrist right a lot of denominations know that but they're fixing to be all turned to it that's right they don't they just there's that's how deceived they are is that they'll they'll tell you boy that popes Antichrist and we know that that's the Beast and we know that that's the and they're just walking right into it because the Bible says he will rule he'll rule them all but they're there so they're against it now but something's going to happen that's going to turn them of course now we don't want things for sure there's going to be a group of people called a foolish virgin that's going to repeal that and get away from it and then they're going to be hunted down and killed but that's after we're gone right all right so he makes his appearing here on earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false pretense of the true word he associates himself with the word like I said before that white righteous church that was truly here in the first Street Church ages Satan didn't go in the barroom he got in that church he attached himself to that church same way when he got off of his white horse and got on the red horse he didn't ride in that direction no he kept right up with that sanctified Church then he kept right up with the Holy Ghost filled Church he associated himself with the word that's kind of scary but you know what it's not it really shouldn't be scared now because we should know we should know where he's at and what he's doing his whole tactic was revealed under those seals sure the plan of redemption that's number one but it did show where he was but see that shows me that I can be fully redeemed when I know what that guy is and where he's at and what he's doing and then what his tactics are alright number eight now we had him come in last night with a great sword to kill we find out that he gets killed with a sword - hey touchdown touchdown you can all say Amen and you can clap your hands do whatever you want do that touchdown okay we fire we find out he gets killed with a sword - you have to do that every once in a while the sword of the word now who's got it do who's got it this message made alive in a group of people the sword of the word God's war words sharp two-edged sword slays him puts him right down listen watch this wait till them seven thunders uttered their voices to that group who really can take the Word of God and hand it there amen it'll slice and cut they can close the heavens they can shut this to that whatever they want to glory because remember you know the sword went into brother branham's hand right it fit okay that's all right but remember later on his comment his comment was it was beautiful it was nice he said but it takes a strong hand to faith and know how to handle that SOI see we're the ones that know how to handle the sword and not that brother branham didn't he was the first-fruit he was the one that come to him first but you and I have to have a sword in the hand experience the our end has to fit the Word of God and you know what if there's going to be a group who really take the word have hand it they're slicing cut that's in you and me that we know how to handle it we know how to handle the word he will be slayed by the word that proceeds from his mouth is sharper than a two-edged sword it could call for a hundred billion tons of flies if they wanted to a man whatever they say is going to happen now he's talking about the two prophets but I'm talking about me and you because it's the Word of God coming from the mouth of God God always it's his word but he always uses man to work it God could call for them flies down in Egypt but he said Moses that's your job I'll just tell you what to do and you go do it he fully done it he could have chose the son to call him he could have caused the moon to call her the wind but he said Moses that that he chooses man all right so God choose man to do this so it's got to come through a man that all right now look let's go to the next one I want to read a scripture that they don't have so this is what's happening in this we read this in the theit iron age they don't have it so I'm going to read the revelations to verse 20 notwithstanding I have a few things against you because I'll have suffered that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants that's this day now I know what star Tyra that was their part they got but it's today that same spiritual life seduce my servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed in the idols I give her space to repent we've had sixty years to get this message together I give her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works so now let's read this last list we read this quote right here number nine see the loving long-suffering of God now this is in the fourth seal because we got to remember spiritual death has got to strike before the Exodus spiritual death had to strike before Israel left Egypt there was all the different plagues but the last one and guess who called the plague you remember who called the plague Pharaoh called it Pharaoh called it Moses didn't Pharaoh said I'll kill every one of your firstborn Moses said you've called it let it happen but he never got to it because remember he was prophesying against his own self and God sent the death angel killed all of his clothes there was no blood there amen they didn't have a lamb you and I have a lamp amen before he passed judgment upon her he gave her a place to repent and it's in the name of the Lord I say this he give the Protestant Church the same thing and she won't do it now remember there's good people in them churches we've talked about this yesterday listen people live better lives than we do but that system is what's rotten that system has nothing to do with goddess of the devil because what's this he's give the Protestant Church the same thing and she won't do it these messages shook everywhere and she won't do it she's going to have her own dogmas and creeds I don't care how much you explain it like he gave Egypt he gave Egypt place to repent what was that last plague was death that's the last plague that hits the Pentecostal church it's spiritual death she's dead that's in the name of the Lord she's spiritually dead he gave her place to repent and she rejected it now she's dead she'll never rise again now if we believe brother Branham being a prophet that can't be broke they're dead spiritually dead everybody you hear people say I got the Holy Ghost I spoke in tongues but they don't want to come around to church like this oh oh you know I don't believe I want to go around the place like that and then say you got the Holy Ghost but you want your dignified way you want to stand babbling and still enjoy the blessings of heaven you have to make your choice you can't stay out there in the world and serve God at the same time Jesus said you couldn't serve God and Mammon so if you won't expect so if you won't expect if you really get saved you'll enjoy meetings where the Holy Spirit is vindicating itself and showing that the Word of God is so that all rights amen the last plague to hit the Pentecostal church was death spiritual death they're dead now let's read this one more quote number 2 him oh my notice he gave her a space to repent but she didn't do it he's done it again she won't do it her rejection away makes her or her rejection makes a perfect way for Satan to come into her and be incarnate incarnate himself right in her because she rejected the word and that's exactly the same thing that the Protestant church becomes a harlot is because she rejects the vindicated truth of the word of God and that gives the devil a place to come right in and incarnate himself and he will make an image unto the Beast when they can consolidate together right yonder now now this is 1963 this is 1963 50 something years they've had to build this thing right over yonder and go on and do just exactly what he said that's right so the Protestant church has become a harlot and like I said before they they'll tell you and they'll tell you they'll tell you boy that Roman Catholic churches you know no but they're going right into it you see how slick that is they're going listen they're gonna worship an incarnate demon and think he's God see how bad that is let me read this one they don't have this they want to pull it up it's a token 1963 it goes let me tell you today paragraph 222 let me tell you today as his servant unless the token is on the door there is a spiritual death going to strike and all churches are headed back for the Council of the world council of churches they're all going back to Catholicism that was in 1963 right after the seals reprieve and only these who are genuine born-again is going to stay out remember not your Pentecostal denominations because they're already in it shows they are dead they are perished they sacrificed they went back they put him outside the door but he's looking for the token because the only thing they relied upon was speaking in tongues don't you rely on no speaking in tongues no nothing else but let the token itself be there the person listen the person of Jesus Christ can't be in you and the person of the devil at the same time so if the person of Jesus Christ is in you settle it people sadly then that you are God made manifest in another form you have you have come to a place that you are eternal those who he's justified he's already glorified and then the person of Jesus Christ you've either got the first you meet the got the person of Christ or the person of the devil one of the two amen but let the token itself be there the person of Jesus Christ his own life in you circumcise not just this that but circumcise your whole being till you and Christ are one Christ is in you and his life lives out through you let me read one more on unveiling of God 1964 paragraph 157 since they spiritually die now they pull that up because watch I want you to watch this right here I just got these in the back of the one to have a couple more quo they spiritually die now this is a spiritual veil that was a natural veil this is a spiritual veil they keep walking on in behind there and you can tell them oh I know I know that but go ahead it's all right the only speech you remember the last plague in Egypt was death before the Exodus the last plague on earth this earth it's spiritual death before the Exodus then they'll be cremated they'll be cremated and turn back to dust and the righteous will walk out upon their ashes but the last thing is spiritual death rejecting the word amen that's the last thing to strike the church the last thing to strength it lice plague you want to have a plague that's the plate it's spiritual death don't worry about the Flies in the fleas and the frogs and all those things listen we're gonna be out of here we're gonna be out of here but that last plague is gonna fall while Israel was in Egypt the plague fell that's what's happening now the place is falling on the church and I ain't talking about just a method to send the Baptist and the Pentecostal because it'll deceive the very elect if it were possible close we know it's not possible but it's gonna be close so you and I must be in the forward know on this fourth seal we see that now this is what I was thinking the other day you and I let's go ahead and stand the musicians come you're not work or working now under obviously the full Word of God amen if we're working under the full word of God we're heading in the right direction but what about the ones that not just I'm not saying come here to this physical building but come to the presence of the full Word of God and then turn it away I don't care for their brand of minds I don't care if they believe this message 50 years if they walk up and reject any part of the message any part will you just fill in the blank because I'm not going to but you got to be in we've got to nail our requirement our box is forward our box says that this thing's going in the rapture and it's got going in a rapture with unbelief it's got to be the full Word of God you'll be careful to lose is that too much Josh am I gonna need to turn me off all right let's sing a song Lord bless you that for seals tithe I'm telling you like brother Branham said Oh turn that thing off will you turn again it scared me to death I know you're not supposed to have fear but that was I was scared that was hey and I just said you was gonna be a preacher man what are you doing you scare me to death maybe I scared you when I said that but let's sing a song worship the Lord you love the Lord listen we're living under a real horrible time but

the married be married let this one happen let that happen like dick brother dick sings a song you know I'm a merridy cowan had to order me married a wife and had a cow and that was a slip-up I'm sorry but but I mean we make the excuses though and as we make excuses who's full of excuses is the devil God don't have to make excuses he never has made an excuse oh yeah he said the Bible I repented but he knew that before the foundation of the world what do you mean he it wasn't something that he was going oh I'm sorry I'm a I'm sorry I made man no he's saying that for our benefit showing a compassionate God this we're inside of that compassion of God he's like man can y'all just get on with this thing you know I know what the end of its gonna be you know and I know what you're gonna do but I still want you to hurry up so I still want you to hurry up so let's hurry let's sing a song turn to page 137 that's what you seek are in the blood let's worship the Lord judge for man
